# CS770_project
 
**Bag of Tricks for Efficient Text Classification**

The code implementation for this project is split across two files: classifier_models.ipynb and reddit_scrape_and_fasttext_corpus.ipynb. The classifier models notebook is the main component of the project, containing the implementation of the proposed model as well as the implementation of the original paper's model using FastText (the paper's official model implementation library). The training times, accuracies, and F1 scores of these models are compared and explored.
