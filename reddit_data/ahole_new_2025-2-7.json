        "selftext": "My sister(30F) just had her birthday and is obsessed with celebrating things now. She had her big birthday 4 day ski trip cancelled because of weather and is pissed because she had been planning it for a while. She made a big deal out of it because in her eyes she never got to celebrate anything. We went for a meal and karaoke but she didn\u2019t feel like it was enough of a celebration.  Tbh our family isn\u2019t big on celebrating anything but my sister kind of brought it on herself. My sister put a lot more pressure on herself when she was younger because everyone told her she was a genius. She skipped grades and graduated high school at 16. She didn\u2019t attend prom because she was younger than the other students so even though she was a senior she hung out with student her own age more so she didn\u2019t have friends to go with. Plus if I remember correctly she had AP exams afterwards so she spent that night studying because at that point she needed an A in every subject. She always says it was her biggest regret in life. Our parents didn\u2019t put that on her she was just over the top back then. I think it\u2019s overblown because she is very successful now in a job that\u2019s hard to get into so it\u2019s not like her hard work wasn\u2019t rewarded. Tons of people work hard without much to show for it which is worse.   She was complaining to me constantly about her 30th being ruined and said she only has her wedding to look forward to now (she isn\u2019t engaged yet but probably will be this year). I told her she shouldn\u2019t put so much on the wedding and it\u2019s just an expensive party which she can afford yes but it\u2019s still a lot to be putting on a single day. She said it\u2019s her last chance to celebrate something and all the achievements she had has been pushed aside to make room for the next thing and she wants her wedding to be memorable like her 30th was suppose to be but in a good way. She mentioned again skipping prom as an example and I told her that skipping prom to study is kind of a humble brag but more so it\u2019s not a big deal. I went to prom and honestly it wasn\u2019t that interesting, I get she missed it and it sucks but she has way better things in life rn. She got mad and said I got a lot more things celebrated than her so I don\u2019t understand what it\u2019s like to go back and realize there isn\u2019t even a single photo of the event. I\u2019ve texted her a few times since and she just replies with one word answers and I just wonder if she\u2019s overreacting or I\u2019m the asshole here. ",

        "selftext": "Last weekend, I had to fly out of town for my brother\u2019s funeral. He was a secret alcoholic and I hadn\u2019t seen him in 5 years. It was a rough trip. They had the idea that he would really like it if we went to an arcade bar and they kept buying drinks. I ended up having 5 voodoo rangers. The whole thing was weird. Because of the flight time and the location we ended up just staying the night at the airport. It was rough. Since I had no one else to help, I asked my best friend (let\u2019s call him Adam) and his girlfriend (let\u2019s call her Sue) to let my puppy out while I was gone.I was only supposed to be gone from Friday at 5 to Sunday at 3pm.  His parents (Mark and Lisa) also helped out. I called Adam and told him the instructions to take care of the pets, but I didn\u2019t leave a written list, which I now realize might have been a mistake. The original plan was for them to take him over to their house since he\u2019s about 3 months old. But Adam  didn\u2019t communicate that with his dad. And then the vet told us he had roundworm so that made it not possible for them because Mark  and Lisa\u2019s dog is old and they didn\u2019t want to risk it. When I got back, the first thing I noticed was that my puppy was in the wrong crate, he was covered in pee, and had chewed up the bed in that crate. So clearly, things weren\u2019t followed how I had asked. That already frustrated me on top of being hungover and exhausted and grieving. But I was too exhausted to deal with it at the time. My wife sent a thank-you text to Mark and Lisa but accidentally left out Adam and Sue. A little while later, Mark called me, asking about it and then straight-up asked if I was mad. The truth is, I was. because they didn\u2019t really do what I had asked. But instead of apologizing or acknowledging anything, Adam immediately shifted blame, saying it was my fault for not explaining things well enough, and got very pissed about me not saying thank you. Then Sue said I was being passive aggressive. Instead of saying something back I just told her that I\u2019d like to keep it between me and Adam because I originally asked him. I did shut her down but I didn\u2019t want her to get caught in the middle. That pissed her off royally though. Now, mutual friends are telling me I should smooth things over because Adam feels unappreciated and Sue feels disrespected. I do appreciate that they helped, but their reaction made me feel like they weren\u2019t being very understanding of what I had just gone through. AITA for not thanking them right away and for feeling put off by how they handled this? UPDATE: So I was going to Clarify on a couple things. 1. There was no neglect and that wasn't the point of the argument 2. I know I was frustrated over minor things. I would have never brought it up if it weren't for mark calling me and asking about it and pushed for an answer. 2. The reason my wife texted was because i was driving home and I fully intended on calling him personally to thank him and even joke around about my frustrations. I gave context in my post as to why I wanted to wait 3. I am appreciative of their help and I told them that when we were arguing, It did come off as not genuine. The whole thing got a lot bigger than I think needed to be and I didn't understand why. 4. I went ahead and talked to everyone and apologized for being frustrated and letting that overshadow my appreciation. Adam is still insisting that I should have just said thank you and bent the knee. The whole interaction I think is silly, but not worth being mad about. Puppies are a handful and he did a pretty good job all things considered.  5. Finally, some of y'all are out there. This was clearly a minor case of who the butthole is and coming at me saying I drank too much or that my wife carries the emotional burden is not needed. I definitely wasn't acting in the best way but I think a little grace is merited. I would really hesitate to wanna be friends with people who would kick you while your down. ",

        "selftext": "An internet mutual and I had the idea to apply to artist alley tables at conventions together, because it's easier to take care of a table with two people (if one has to pee, the other can babysit the artwork).  He has experience as a vendor at Cons and I do not. So I thought he could be my guide and help me navigate all that stuff. I also thought that our chances of actually getting a table would be better because he already had that experience.  We've applied at the end of last year and by now we have been rejected by every single convention we have applied to. With one exception. One convention didn't allow shared tables so we applied separately and then planned to ask the Con to put our tables next to each other if both of us got accepted.   Well, he got a rejection and I was accepted. It's by far the biggest Convention we applied to with the most competition for the tables. And it is his Dream Convention he always wanted to vend at.  The two of us had found 3 more Conventions we'd like to try for before I got that accepted to the big Con. But since I got that acceptance letter I am thinking that I might have better chances of getting in if I apply alone.  I knew from the get go that the products he made were of lower quality than mine but I thought his vending experience would be more important to Cons than the quality of his things (turns out, most Cons don't even ask if you have prior experience and just look at the products).  Why I would be the asshole: Breaking a promise is bad and he has talked multiple times about how he just isn't good enough and about how sad he is about all the rejections. I don't want to add insult to injury.  Why I wouldn't be the asshole: It turns out that his vending experience is limited to small Conventions. It seems like in most cases he was accepted, because all applicants were accepted. I didn't know about this before we decided to share a table. I don't think he intentionally mislead me but I would have made a different decision if I had known.   And for him art is a hobby, for me it's my job. The stakes are higher for me because my income depends on it.  Would I be the asshole if I break the promise I made to apply together and tell him that I want to apply alone?    ",

        "selftext": "My fianc\u00e9e (31F) and I (33M) have a daughter together (2F). My mom passed away in 2020, my dad lives on the other side of the country, and my fianc\u00e9e's parents both passed away in 2014. That leaves the only grandparent figures to my daughter that live nearby as my own grandparents (69F and 72M), who live about 15 minutes away. My grandma (step, but has been a grandma to me my whole life) has an incurable cancer, and my grandpa has dementia that is early on but progressing. Partly for these reasons, we would like our daughter to get as many memories with them as possible while they're still around and before my grandpa's memory loss becomes severe. There was one time we attempted an overnight stay with them while we were home by ourselves. It didn't go so well; she had a hard time going to sleep and was clear she has some separation anxiety. It wasn't all bad, but clearly something that needs to be worked on.  Ever since, my grandma, who between the two of them is usually the one we talk to and who makes decisions, has been quick to point out examples of her showing separation anxiety when around (which has become infrequent, the last time being on Christmas). When asking if they'd be willing to take her for a couple hours to get some time with her, whether just because or we have something to take care of, she refuses, saying she needs to get over separation anxiety before they can take her again. Our thoughts are that she won't get over it if we don't give her a chance to. And we don't exactly have a village of people able to help with that, as partly mentioned before. Meanwhile, my grandparents frequently watch the kids of my cousin (25F), the kids being 6F, 4M, 3M, and 2F. She is no longer with either of the two fathers and has been known to frequently dump her kids on our grandparents. My grandma has said multiple times after various incidents of disrespect that she will not help my cousin anymore, but ultimately winds up doing so anyway. When we bring up these issues, my grandma claims that because these kids are not well taken care of (sadly true), she needs to keep a closer eye on them; we take this as our daughter being punished for being well taken care of. She also believes they do not have separation anxiety because of the rocky relationship with their mom, so they are more willing to be at their house. She takes our pushing that we accuse her of playing favoritism with the other kids.  We realize that someone has to watch those kids so their mom can work. My situation is more fortunate in that regard as I work while my fianc\u00e9e is a stay at home mom. But we think there needs to somehow be more balance in the situation. And again, to have my daughter and grandparents to get plenty of time together before it's too late. So... AITA?",

        "selftext": "My brother (48) passed away about a year ago - complications from alcohol addiction. He and his ex gf had a terrible and long relationship (10 years), in which she was cruel to me and my mother. They broke up, she threw him out, she took him back. We took him into out home to get him clean, and she came and picked him up. He got DUI\u2019s, we left him in jail to detox, she bailed him out. She refused to quit drinking and enabled his alcohol issues. She said they were in love, and other times she said he was a \u2018homeless guy\u2019 that lived with her.  My brother came to my house under hospice care, and given the animosity, I asked her not to come to my home. She did tell him goodbye at the hospital, and then screamed at me and my mother over his hospital bed because she blamed us for his issues. After my brother passed, my mother had him cremated and kept all of his remains. Immediately after he passed, I updated the ex and asked if he had any belongings at her house (he had family heirlooms, tools from my deceased grandfather, etc.) She told us she had thrown away his things and anything he had left was hers, since she had bought it.  Every other month, she sends me drunk messages demanding ashes and insulting me when I say no. She has never once expressed sympathy towards me or my mother.  I am done with the messages. I am thinking of getting a tiny urn and filling it with ashes from my cremated pets, and giving her that just to resolve the issue.

When I was given the opportunity to live rent-free in a family-owned apartment (as long as I found a roommate to pay a small rent), I chose Ava over a few other options because we were closest at the time. At first, things were fine, but now I feel suffocated. She constantly interrupts my study time, pushing me to play video games or chat despite my boundaries. I\u2019m an extrovert, but after long days at school, I crave alone time. When I retreat to my room, she knocks, saying she feels lonely and wants to sit on my floor, staring at me or talking about her day. I don\u2019t have the backbone to say no, and she pushes back when I try.  Enter my other best friend, Erica (18F), who I\u2019ve known since we were 10. She\u2019s introverted, incredibly kind, and planning for med school, meaning she\u2019s highly study-oriented. She currently lives in expensive student housing but plans to move home next year, which would mean a brutal 1-2 hour commute. If I had chosen her as my roommate originally, she would have benefited from the affordable rent.  Recently, Ava\u2019s parents offered her a free apartment near campus. I was thrilled for her and saw it as the perfect opportunity\u2014she could save money, and Erica could move in, improving her living situation. I told Erica it was a possibility, and she was excited. However, Ava just told me she\u2019s staying because she\u2019s comfortable here and doesn\u2019t want a new roommate. When she told me, I couldn\u2019t hide my disappointment. Now Ava keeps saying it\u2019s my fault for getting Erica\u2019s hopes up and insists I just want to replace her. But I truly think this move would be better for everyone\u2014Ava could grow more independent, save money, and Erica wouldn\u2019t have to commute for hours.

I didn\u2019t take it with me when I moved to the city where I study, I left it at my mom\u2019s house. Since it was fluffy and comfortable, she started sleeping with it every night. After spending a year abroad, I came back to my hometown for a month. Every time I saw that teddy bear, it reminded me of my ex and the moment he gave it to me, so I decided to throw it in the fire without asking my mom. I didn\u2019t think she was that attached to it, I only considered that I didn\u2019t want anything from my ex in the house anymore. Three days later, my mom asked about the teddy bear.

She said she had slept with it every night for the past three years, that it was really comfortable, and that it helped calm her breathing and anxiety.

        "selftext": "For context, I have been with my girlfriend for 11 years and I turned vegan 3 years ago for ethical reasons. Before that, I was not eating a lot of meat, but I knew that I was not really doing the best thing (ethically). I was not vegan because I did not want to create any friction with family, friends, etc. but at some point, I decided to go vegan. For me, it doesn't make sense to kill/harm animals when I can just buy a can of chickpeas or buy some tofu instead. My girlfriend understands this and stayed omnivore, because she doesn't want to give up on things that she loves to eat. We live together so, me switching up to veganism obviously impacted her since we cook together only vegan/vegan adaptable meals. She sometimes buys cheese, milk, chicken and fish that she cooks for herself. Other than being vegan, I have a full time job and have many hobbies that take a lot of my time (competing in Ironmans, learning multiple languages, etc), so it is a struggle to spend a lot of good quality time with my girlfriend. Anyway, on her birthday, I came late from work and I went to a restaurant where they make some Poke bowls. I wanted to make her happy and knew that if she was with me, she would order the salmon poke bowl, but I ended up ordering a vegan Poke bowl anyway, because I did not think her birthday would justify me spending money on an industry that I really don't want to encourage. I felt that even tough it would no be her choice, it would still be a nice gesture. When I came back home with the vegan poke bowls, she was disappointed and kind of angry at me because she knew exactly what went in my head when I bought the bows. She felt that even on her birthday, I could not do any compromise and think solely about what she wanted. She says that even when I give something to somebody else, I don't put myself purely in their heads and that I always filter my actions based on MY standards. What do you think ? Edit : Thank you for all your comments. I am a selfish a*hole and definitely have to work on being a better boyfriend and a better person in general. My girlfriend is a wonderful person and I mistreated her. I will put myself more in her shoes next time I want to treat her and put myself and my standards out of the way. ",

        "selftext": "Son's birthday today. He's 5 years old. I wasnt there this morning as stay away from home some nights due to work. Even if had slept at home would have left for work before the kids woke. We have a party planned on Saturday, and will be there at dinner time tonight. I realised that my wife gave my son a present this morning. She said it was from 'us. Apparently she does this every year. I was hurt, and told her so. I thought it was selfish that she couldn't wait to share his excitement.  Her excuse is that it is unfair on him to make him wait. find that ridiculous, and believe he absolutely could wait.  I said the only reason to give it early is the selfishness of wanting to experience his joy alone without sharing it. AITA?  Edit(s): This blew up quicker than I expected (I couldn't get online for the last hour). And overwhelmingly with YTA responses, many with some unfair assumptions so I want to add some context in my defence although I think it wont change the general outcome. 1. Today is his birthday, although we have other special plans. Next week I'm taking 3 days off work, two of which are for a family trip and the third is a special day for my son. I couldn't get today off work though, and Saturday is his proper party, which I obviously will be there. I have a 1.5 hour commute each way (hence why I don't normally see him in the morning before he gets up for school), but I normally read the bedtime story when I'm home and I video call EVERY evening that I'm not home. I'm not an absentee father, and I'm not just a sperm donor. 2. My wife has bought most of the presents but not all of them. We tend to put things in gift bags not wrap them. Last year it was me that bought the main present, this year there wasn't a main present, it was mostly a few smaller ones because the family trips mentioned in (1) are really his main present. I don't expect her to do all the gift shopping and give all the ideas, I do a share of it. She does have more free time than me, and does more of the childcare than me. That's a problem of our (shared) lifechoices and not something that we can easily change. My long commute is primarily due to decisions on her part. 3. Yes, she said she does this every year, but first and second birthday are not quite the same level of concious response, and 3rd and 4th I am not sure what she gave him in the morning. As I mentioned, last year I got the 'main' present, and that was given in the evening I am definitely jealous if she is giving him presents. I definitely want to be part of the enjoyment of his birthday.  I was hurt and didn't understand why he had to receive the present when I wasn't there. Yep he's 5 years old, and every family is different. I don't remember receiving presents until the whole family was there in the evening. I thought that was normal, and assumed my wife had the same thoughts. We hadn't discussed it, and I was upset for missing out.I think if I knew, then I wouldn't have reacted that way, but it was a shock and I was upset. I still am jealous and have some feelings to work through. I don't like my work situation and commute, but I really don't see a way to resolve it (without significant financial risk that I'm not willing to take in this climate) so will have to suck up my disappointment. I called my wife selfish for getting the joy, alone without discussing it first, or without giving me the chance to join on video call. I guess I need to take the YTA verdict. Edit(again):Too many comments to respond to, and can't respond for at least a few hours so that I can spend time with my son on his birthday!",

        "selftext": "Hello!  I (29, M) had an argument with my partner (29, M) over my decision to bail out of my partner's friend's wedding. Some background:I have a pretty bad social anxiety. I'm also not fully out of the closet and struggle with internalise homophobia (I'm not out to my family). I have not been fully comfortable with attending social events with my partner (weddings, parties etc.) as a couple because of my issues. I have made a few attempts but they did not go very well usually (I ended up feeling drained and stressed out). Recently we have been invited to my partner's friend's wedding (I don't know them well at all). He insisted it's important for him that I attend. I understood that and agreed. Recently, however a wedding of my cousin came up, which is actually on the same date as the other wedding. I am not that close to my cousin, but as everyone I am close with will be there, I think it's important for me to attend. Also, my parents made it clear that I should attend. I also live in a different country so I don't see them that often. I think that it is reasonable for me to attend the wedding of my cousin since it is my family instead of some other person's that I do not know well even though they're a friend of my partner. My parents of course do not know I have a partner, therefore I cannot say that I have that other wedding. My partner insisted that I lie to them and say that I am ill or already have a holiday booked, but I don't feel it's right (even though I needed to lie to them on some other occasions). To be honest, even if my parents knew about the situation, I still think it is reasonable for me to attend a wedding that is important for me and to spend some time with my family (and would actually be a bit weird the other way). Now, we had a big fight with my partner over this (the biggest so far). He is saying I broke a promise for an unspecified reason and that he does not want to attend the event on his own again. I however feel that because this is actually not because of my social anxiety or my internalised homophobia that I am not going with him, he is slightly overreacting. He says I do not care about his feelings, which is not true. I simply need to make a choice and this on its own is uncomfortable for me. AITA?",

        "selftext": "Before diving into the problem that happened last week, I need to do some background from previous years. I'm 25 (M) have been playing RPGs with my friends for a long time (about 10 years together), we've tried many systems, books and even made our own RPG (it didn't work out as intended). Around 2020, the pandemic hit my country and my schedule changed, because of that, I had to quit some RPG sessions and deny new ones until I figured out my new schedule. At the time denied an RPG that I really wanted, however, I couldn't commit to participating; the planning started in mid-2020, but it didn't work out so the idea was scraped out. After that, in 2022, the pandemic was much more manageable, and everything was getting back to normal, the RPG plan that I wanted to play with my friends was coming back, but they didn't invite me. The Dungeon Master (DM for short) already had a full team (6 people), and was unable to add one more.At the time, I was the jerk because I started harassing the DM to put me in the game, and this started a big fight (if necessary, I will can be specific in an edit), but long story short, all RPG games with my friends were stopped for 6 months because I created a rift between friends, some understood the context of 2020 and they were on my side, others defended the DM because I denied my seat at the time. In the end, the DM and I apologized for eachother and the RPG did not happen. Now, for the problem that is happening: Another RPG started brewing with another DM (I will call her Anna) started planning a Oneshot, she is already a DM in another RPG session (D&D) that I also play, however, she wanted to also DM Exalted (a really complex system). Anna invited me and 4 other friends to play, at the time I said yes. So the next day I started reading the system and was really intimidated,it has 200+ charms, and alot of specifc rules, so I asked one of the players for help, but it didn't help much. Intimidated and confused, I later told Anna that I was vacating my seat; she was upset but didn't argue, later another friend took my seat. My reasoning to gave up my seat was that I wouldn't commit to a really complex system to play only 1-3 sessions, only if it was a campaign I would comit. A few days passed, and I heard from my friends that Anna was thinking about changing the Exated one-shot to a campaign, and she would stop her D&D campaign for it. I didn't tell my friends at the time, but I was really upset, not only would the one-shot become a campaign, but the other campaigns would stop because of it. So, IATA for asking for my playce back in the campaing with the fear of bringing back that rift and maybe losing some friends?",

When I graduate I\u2019ll be going overseas for a few weeks as well. But the problem is that my mother purposely planned the trip so they\u2019d be away during Easter.  I\u2019m an older teen, so this isn\u2019t that big of a deal for me, but my younger brother is still a kid and always gets excited around the holidays. Also, every holiday is a family event and we always spend them together, celebrating and what not I wish I could say this isn\u2019t a babb  it but my mother has always favoured my oldest brother. It\u2019s always been frustrating, but it\u2019s never gotten to the point where she\u2019s purposely flying into a different country with him to celebrate a holiday alone.  It became a problem and I told my mom she was being unfair to her two other children who expected to be to father for the holiday. I told her it was clear she cared more about (oldest brother) than me and (younger brother), and that she and him were being selfish bitches.  My mom said that j was being self centred and ruining her and (oldest brothers moment) and he said that j was trying to ruin his trip because i was jealous I don\u2019t think im the asshole, but they both sah that I\u2019m being ridiculous and selfish.

        "selftext": "Pre-COVID, I (31F) was a bridesmaid for my cousin, Diva (34F). Everything was going smoothly until a few weeks before the wedding. Being artistically inclined, I offered to design her wedding invitations as a gift but made it clear I couldn't produce them myself due to financial constraints, as I was handling my mother's medical bills and our family dog's medication for his heart condition. To provide context, I'm an only child caring for a senior citizen (my mother, who is over 70 years old and a cancer patient) and our senior dog. As the wedding planning progressed, Diva approved my designs with some revisions, and I happily submitted them. However, when the actual invitations arrived, they weren't my designs. This was heartbreaking because if I had been informed that my design wouldn't be used, I would have been fine with it, but no one told me. I let it go and moved on. Regarding the pre-wedding parties, I couldn't attend due to my mother's and our dog's medical conditions, which Diva knew about for months and years prior. Despite this, Diva was upset. I couldn't leave my mother, as there was no one else to care for her, nor could she handle our dog, who needed medication and could be aggressive. Hiring help was also not an option due to financial constraints. The Maid of Honor (MOH) got involved, and I kept asking for consideration due to my family responsibilities. The whole family knew about my mother's condition, and some knew about our dog's condition, but I was told I wasn't fulfilling my bridesmaid duties. I had already designed the invitations and helped with bridesmaid dress choices, but I couldn't attend the pre-wedding parties. This led to a feud among the cousins and eventually reached our parents. Days before the wedding, I was still trying to be a good bridesmaid. Hair and makeup were scheduled for 3 AM, but with my responsibilities, I couldn't leave home at 2 AM. I offered to do my own hair and makeup and even negotiated to arrive before the wedding started, prioritizing the ceremony. However, they wouldn't compromise, so my mother and I decided not to attend to avoid further drama. In hindsight, it was a blessing in disguise because our dog passed away on the wedding day, and we were there for him when he passed.",

        "selftext": "I m(32) was sent to the shopping centre on the way home from work to get lasagne sheets for my wife f(35). I went to the pasta aisle and took a look at the lasagne sheets on offer and found one box that stated \u201cno pre cooking required\u201d so I assumed that would be a great option and got it. Today while driving to lunch my wife said to me that she didn\u2019t mean this as an attack but that she had told me to get fresh lasagne sheets, which are the soft ones in the cold aisle. I told her I didn\u2019t hear her say fresh when she asked me or I would have probably figured out she meant cold. I then asked her what the difference was and why it mattered. She said that the fresh ones cook quicker.I responded that it does say no pre cooking required on the box, assuming maybe this was a newer technology and so it wouldn\u2019t be as long.She said that didn\u2019t matter. I then asked if she had used the no pre cooking required before and compared the cooking times to the fresh ones, since we don\u2019t make lasagne much (I can recall one time in our 7 years together) and I wouldn\u2019t think she would have used these before and was making assumptions. She then started to get angry and said that we always get the fresh ones and if she says she w at the fresh ones then that should be it and she shouldn\u2019t have to justify why she wants them, if she says to get them then just get them. I argued that I always like to educate myself and will clarify and ask questions rather than ever just go ahead and do what you\u2019re told, that isn\u2019t who I am and I should be able to ask questions and clarify. At no point did I say I wouldn\u2019t get the fresh ones in the future or that I was right to get the no pre cook ones, I\u2019m just trying to make sure I understand what the difference is and that she has also considered the differences. She then said that the way I was saying it was defensive and right fighting and that she felt I wasn\u2019t listening to her because I was asking all these questions rather than just saying \u201cyes dear\u201d.I continued to explain that I was just trying to understand and clarify, I wasn\u2019t defending that I was right to get those sheets or that I wouldn\u2019t get the fresh ones in the future but she said it didn\u2019t matter because of the way it was making her feel.She wasn\u2019t able to clarify what about my tone or words or mannerisms was making her feel that way rather than just feeling like I\u2019m trying to understand. So I don\u2019t know how to avoid this in the future but not just end up as a mindless \u201cyes dear\u201d robot. Am I the asshole because I tried to understand why she wanted fresh sheets instead of just noting to get fresh sheets next time?",

        "selftext": "Okay so some background, I am a female high school student and I am dating a boy in high school as well. However, we go to different schools. This Saturday he has his snowball dance and 3 weeks ago we talked about it and mutually decided we\u2019d go to my schools because he didn\u2019t wanna go to his and he thought mine would be more fun so I agreed. I wanted to go to both but didn\u2019t push because I didn\u2019t want to make him do smth he didn\u2019t want to. I figured it wouldn\u2019t be an issue. A few days ago he asked what day my dance was on and I told him \u201cit\u2019s in two weeks\u201d and he said \u201coh okay cool because my friends just invited me to go to my schools dance and stay the night at his house.\u201d And I got a little hurt and said \u201cwhy are you going? I thought you didn\u2019t want to because it was lame\u2026?\u201d And he said \u201cwell I just got invited and I think I\u2019d be fun with my friends.\u201d and we js left it at that. Today, the topic was brought up again and I told him I was uncomfortable with the idea because there are quite a few girls at his school that I\u2019m very suspicious of, there is a girl he\u2019s friends with who is going, and it was weird to go to a school dance with your friends when you have a gf. He told me I was being paranoid and he wasn\u2019t gonna cheat and he js wanted to have fun with friends. I told him I was fine with him hanging out with his friends but maybe in a setting I was more comfortable with. He said I was being dramatic and it was js an innocent hang out, I told him it was weird to go with your friends and he said \u201ceveryone went with each other last time\u201d and I told him \u201cyeah that\u2019s bc they don\u2019t have gfs\u201d and he got all annoyed. I\u2019ve talked with 4 of my good girl friends, 1 male friend, my brother, my parents, and a family friend and all of them think it\u2019s a little odd. I tried explaining my whole side of things and how I would prefer if he skipped so I\u2019d be more comfortable and he just told me girls don\u2019t like him, he\u2019s not interested, and I\u2019m being annoying and pissing him off because he just wants to hang out with his friends. I know this is very stupid and trivial, but these are my issues and I\u2019m only in high school once. Let me have little problems now. Am I the asshole for arguing with my bf over this? Edit: On Wednesday he said he would go to my basketball game and then backed out last minute (like an hour before) and told me he\u2019d hang out with me Friday and Sunday to make up for it. I got a text yesterday (Thursday) where he told me he was also spending the night with his friends on Friday night. I got upset and told him that was going to mess up our plans and he got mad at me and said he never does anything with them and he wants to see them. He has a sleep over with them every 2 weeks and when I want to do things with friends I never can because I\u2019m cancelling stuff to be with him. I\u2019ve had people over in October and that was the last time that happened. He ended up breaking up with me because I\u2019m too controlling, according to him. Everyone I\u2019ve talked to thinks that yes I should\u2019ve handled it better and shouldn\u2019t have gotten as upset as I did, but I also explained to him that I wasn\u2019t telling him he couldn\u2019t see his friends but that I was upset that he planned over our previously made plans. He disregarded what I said and how I was feeling. Everyone he talked to about it told him it was extremely impulsive and that he should\u2019ve thought about it more. I skipped school today because I am absolutely devastated. His friends are all trying to talk sense into him and say he\u2019s crazy\u2026 I don\u2019t know what to do now\u2026",

        "selftext": "(Fixed for the people with no reading comprehension.) This is just regular teenage drama, but today I was talking with my friends. Let's call them Beck, Tanny, Hazel, and Abs. I was talking to Abs and Beck, recently Beck and Hazel have been having drama over a boy (of course) and Hazel has been dragging it for months now, Beck and I were talking about how Hazel kept dragging it and about what Abs told us about what Hazel has said about Beck. Now it wasn't good stuff, Hazel was saying Beck was a bad person and that she was a slut.  Beck and I decided to make a group chat with Abs to all talk about it and Beck decided to confront Hazel, Hazel claimed she knew nothing about it even though both me and Abs have heard her say it. After that was over me and Abs agreed to texted Hazel and say we didn't want to be friends her anymore. Since Hazel was the type of person to talk crap about people Abs and I assumed there was stuff about us too. We both texted Hazel and explained. My reasoning was that Hazel kept dragging us into unnecessary drama and that I was worried she was talking crap about us, there was also the fact that Hazel was extremely open about her sexual life with her boyfriend (keep in mind we are ALL minors). She got upset claiming she has never talked shit, then heres were Tanny comes in.  Hazel brings Tanny into the conversation and Tanny starts arguing saying that Hazel never talked shit and that we had no proof of any of our claims, even though Hazel is extremely public about her gossip and personal life. Tanny then started posting about us publicly. Not only that but she then started sending Beck threats to hurt her. Me being tired of the harassment, I decided to just block them. Now that I think about it, I don't really feel bad at all. But theres still the fact it sort of seems that it was me who escalated the situation because it was my idea in the first place to message Hazel and tell her I didn't want to be friends.  I personally think my reasoning was valid because no child should be having sex nor causing unnecessary fights and drama over small things, but I want to know if this makes me the bad guy in this situation. I knew she was struggling with mental health, I knew she had trouble with her parents, and I knew this would affect her, but I still did it. Am I the asshole for this situation escalating and affecting someone, or was I in the right to unfriend her? I'm most likely the asshole in this situation, but I just made this so me and my friends could turn it into one of those Minecraft AI YouTube shorts videos. Thanks for reading!",

        "selftext": "My (29F) daughter is five months old and goes to a daycare at my husband\u2019s (32M) workplace. My mother in law also works at the same place so she has easy access to the daycare. At least once a week she goes and spends 30 minutes to an hour just playing with my daughter. This rubs me the wrong way for so many reasons. As a mom, it frustrates me that she thinks it\u2019s okay to just drop by whenever without at least saying something or asking (I actually just found out while writing this that she tells my husband but nobody communicates it with me). As a former daycare worker, I would have hated having someone just come in and spend time with a child because now not only do they have infants to watch, but now they have to work around a fully grown woman and make sure that she isn\u2019t taking pictures/videos of other babies as well. I think my biggest issue is honestly that some days she gets to spend more awake time with my daughter than I do and I know that\u2019s a horrible reason to be frustrated with someone but it is what it is. Would I be the asshole if I asked her to stop visiting daycare so frequently? She comes to our house and gets to spend several hours with my daughter at least once a week so it\u2019s not like daycare is the only time she gets to see her.   ETA: Yes. I know I\u2019m the asshole for being jealous. After talking with my husband, I\u2019m realizing a lot of these feelings are based on big emotions from being exhausted and PPD. I don\u2019t hate my mother in law. This is my first and probably only child and she\u2019s my rainbow baby so I\u2019m very protective. For those of you that politely told me I\u2019m the asshole, thank you. For those of you that told me I need to see a therapist, already seeing one for my chronic depression and added postpartum depression so I\u2019m good. I\u2019m going to stop reading comments now and go snuggle with my baby that just got home. ",

        "selftext": "I (28F) live with my boyfriend (28M). I work a state govt job that keeps me out late while his job in IT is flexible so he works from home sometimes. We have been dating for a couple years now and recently he moved in with me. I bought the house and pay the mortgage for it entirely. My BF does not pay me any rent since he is currently in a low paying job and actively looking for better options. However he also has the longer commute to work so he pays more for gas now ever since he moved in because previously he lived closer to his workplace. Until he finds a new job, he told me he unable to contribute for the mortgage and hasn't asked to be on the deed either. He does however pay half the utilities and half of the groceries too. He has been extra conscious about not contributing to the mortgage or paying any rent. Since he doesn't pay rent, he tries to make up for it by doing almost all of the cooking for both of us. He also does the laundry and dishes most of the times without complaint. And when I ask him for help cleaning the house like mopping the floors, he helps with that too. He also packs my lunch every morning to save me the trouble of getting up early. I am really lucky that he does all of this. However, he does make a mess (kitchen and bathroom) and his cleaning isn't as good as when I would do it. We also buy a lot of groceries which we have nowhere to put since the house is somewhat small which makes the house a mess again. I didn't have this problem when I was living by myself so it has started to irritate me quite a bit over time. This past weekend, when he was cooking, he happened to drop rice and some sauce on the floor and hadn't cleaned up after so I told him you need to be more careful about dropping things on the floor cause you make a mess sometimes. It caused him to get upset and he started profusely cleaning the floors. Then he proceeded to tell me I know this is your house, but it feels like I need to tiptoe around you here because I am not keeping the place exactly how you want it. I make a mess sometimes but I always clean up after. Might not be immediately but I do get to it and I do my best. I'm sorry that isn't good enough. And this isn't the first time you've said this. He told me the other time this happened was when he was cleaning out our oven and while scrubbing the burnt bits, it dropped black spots all over the white floor which irritated me. And apparently I had told him that he didn't do a good job cleaning the floor one time when I had asked him to do it. After he told me all this, I got upset because and started crying and he spent the next hour consoling me. I am neurotic about keeping the place clean - especially my kitchen since I have had a rodent problem. Ever since this, I have always found him on all fours on the kitchen floor trying to find every last speck of food because I feel like he is convinced that I would get upset again. AITA for telling him he made a mess in the first place and wanting to keep my house clean? EDIT: Clarified being on the deed EDIT 2: I deleted all my replies to the comments because I kept getting downvoted on every single one. I don't understand the downvotes to my replies when I have only thanked the commenters, been civil with my replies and taken their suggestions as good ones and agreeing to make some changes in myself.

On top of that, each of us has saved around $3,000 from birthday money saved for future expenses (such as university) I\u2019m considering withdrawing my $2,600 so that if our dad\u2019s money ever runs low, I won\u2019t have to dip into my own hard-earned cash.

We had 8-2, better than JV and Varsity had this year. We had spent all of our Sumner practicing and grinding every day until the season started. Well, one day in practice (in the middle of July) after warm-ups, I had given a suggestion to our Coach about how the defense needs to work on their hand movement and the way they should go when the ball is snapped. BTW, our defense sucked this summer.....i was on defense\ud83d\ude11. And, he looked at me, like he's my dad when I did something stupid, and I said, What? He said.Well, can't it wait?! Half of the people were on my side, and half were on the coach's. I still continued, and all I said that made him really mad was, Maybe if you weren't so soft on us, then Defense would've sucked right now. And I wanna add one more person, he's another coach, he had served time in the military, and as soon as he heard me what I said , he said All, right. Since yall were soft, LEMME MAN YOU THE F*CK UP! And made all of us run nonstop until practice is over. If we slow down, it is more minutes, walking and talking, more minutes. Luckily, we finished before I had a heart attack, and everyone knew not to give coach obvious facts to anger or punish us like that ever again. AITA?

Sharon and her husband(Vlad) rented out almost the whole resort and paid for a villa for me and my parents to stay in. This villa had a pool (all to ourselves!!) and two separate mini buildings, one for living and one for lounging. This wedding was VERY extravagant with a lot of Vlad's business partners. Their business social life is the type where you are drunk all day making fun of people; each business associate was pretty fat with a wife who had crazy Botox and plastic surgery. After the beach ceremony, we were escorted to a dining/dance space where lots of speeches were given. One of the speeches was given by a business associate's wife(who fits the beauty standard explained above). Her speech was pretty unremarkable, and I wasn't paying much attention until she mentioned Sharon's Son's help with her business called Blackwater. I'm not sure if she made the connection to the infamous mercenary firm, but it made me *almost* laugh, I held it in UNTIL she proceeded to explain what her company was about: water with minerals in it, making it black. Basically, it was dirt water that cracked me up like crazy, and I couldn't hold it in. The room was completely silent before this, and everyone's heads whipped towards me. The speech went on, but it was very awkward. After we finished dinner I was pulled over by Sharon who scolded me for laughing and said that everyone was asking her who I was and why I laughed. Apparently the girl felt very embarrassed and self-conscious after I cracked up. People have been treating me like a pariah ever since. 1.

His place of employment has historically not been a positive place and has been the cause of deep stress for him and strain on our relationship; however, it was recently bought out so company ownership is different and this new position would be kind of a fresh start. He let me know about his new position after he accepted it yesterday. He said that he cares how I feel about it and that he knows it has been rough but he thinks this will be a good thing. I do have mixed feelings, but I am incredibly happy for him and proud and I let him know that. I let it sit and gathered my feelings about all of it and then tried to talk to him about it today. I told him that I am happy and excited for him and that I want to support him in this, want to ensure we respect each other\u2019s feelings, and communicate so we can move forward positively together. He lost it. He said that I hate his job and will never be happy, that he does not want to discuss it - ever -, that he should not have to be my therapist and talk to me about it\u2026 the list goes on. I repeatedly told him I am happy and that I am not upset or angry and that it was a conversation about moving forward with mutual respect and positivity and I did not understand why he was angry and asked if he could tell me what he is upset about so I can try and understand. He could not tell me and just kept saying he never wants to discuss it and that I just always cause problems and am never happy. I am at a loss. I told him I apologize if I miscommunicated somehow, but I literally just wanted him to know that I support him and that even though it has been tough there I want us to move forward supporting and respecting each other (that is the text I sent him verbatim). AITA here? ** update - the stress and strain I refer to is that he has been so stressed he has stopped taking care of himself, going to workouts (which he loves), being angry at everything and snapping at everything all the time. He knows he is doing that and apologize saying he is sorry and that he is just stressed and needs to find a new job because he can\u2019t take it, feels disrespected there, and feels terrible for taking it out on our family. So it has affected our family. ",

        "selftext": "I (23F) have a friend (24F) who is currently in uni in another country. Her family is pretty strict so being far away from them made her go a little wild. Recently she was ranting to me about how her first kiss experience. She and her uni friends went clubbing, where she drank heavily and got drunk, but not drunk enough to fully black out, being still lucid enough to be aware of her surroundings and actions. According to her, this guy started approaching her, and they ended up grinding and eventually the guy kissed her, and it escalated into a full make out session.  The next morning she immediately regretted letting the guy do that to her and she called me for support.  While she described the story, it seemed like she wanted me to reassure her that the kiss didn\u2019t count or to sympathize with her. However, I found it hard to comfort her, or for sorry for what she experienced,  because firstly she knew her friends that went with her were going to be drinking heavily as well so there\u2019s no one looking out for her and she\u2019s going to be on her own. Secondly, she consented to the guy kissing her at that point (not saying no/pushing him/walking away) and also she kissed him back which was what caused the kiss to become a full make out session.  I knew she could\u2019ve done something because after the kiss happened the grinding continued and she began feeling uncomfortable about the guy starting to touch her inappropriately and so she walked away right away so it\u2019s not like she couldn\u2019t have done anything if she did not want him to kiss her. She just regretted giving away her first kiss to a total stranger who she doesn\u2019t even remember.  I didn\u2019t say much on the call and didn\u2019t offer the reassurance she seemed to be seeking. I felt conflicted because I think she willingly engaged in the situation and only regretted it afterward. However, I wonder if I was wrong for not being more supportive as her friend. I might be victim blaming as well for thinking that she should\u2019ve been more careful and responsible about her alcohol intake, knowing that she has no one watching out for her.  AITA? EDIT: I did not say much on the call as I was in complete shock that this happened to her. I was in no way judging her and I feel really bad that her first kiss (which is something she was looking forward to) was taken away like this. I am just wondering if I am the AH for not showing her the support that she wanted me to ie telling her it doesn\u2019t count as her first kiss. I did not tell her off or voice any of my \u201cjudgemental\u201d opinions I just listened.  EDIT 2: My friend asked me and I quote \u201cIt doesn\u2019t count right\u201d as to whether this is her first kiss experience or not I am not assuming anything.  ",

First he asked me only a couple of random days, but now it is almost dayly. He deliberately puts his phone quite far away from our bed, so he has to get up to turn off the alarm. Now I have to get out of bed to turn it off, and I HATE it... Like I don't even know how to describe how much it annoys and irritates me... I am not a morning person, and he knows this, and I have my own morning routine as to make sure I am not grumpy towards everyone in the morning. But turning off his alarm messes up my routine and makes me really frustrated in the morning. Even more so when he asks me to turn off his alarm on my day off. My bf has his own company and prefers to be early at his office. So his alarm is usually set about 40 minutes before my alarm. But sometimes it is also set 10 minutes before my alarm goes off. He will ask me to 'please turn it off one more time' and then stay in bed till my alarm goes. Now this is where I might be the AH, because the extra time in bed he mostly spends cuddling me and I really love it. Before this all started he used to turn off his alarm himself and come back to bed to cuddle, but that doesn't happen anymore.  WIBTA if I told him to either turn off his own alarm from now on, or just not set an alarm and get up when my alarm goes off?",

She has wanted to move for years as the cost of living in our country is horrible, and she \u2018has nothing left here\u2019 (her parents passed away 2 years ago, and she is single).\u00a0 I was originally going to stay here and rent the current place we live in with my older sister [31],, and my BF [20], but my older sister has since decided that she wants to move with my mother, and that leaves me being unable to afford to live in our current house. I don\u2019t wish to leave as I have my whole life here; I just started UNI, my boyfriend and friends live here and my dog \u2018wouldn\u2019t make the trip\u2019. I am unable to work currently as I am chronically ill and am unsure of how my body would react to both full-time study and work. I get government assistance of $210/Weekly which will be unable to cover rent for anywhere but a single room in a share house but I won't be able to bring my dog. I am left in a position where I would have to financially rely on my BF more than I would like to and would be homeless if we ever broke up. I have brought these issues up to my mom and asked her for a bit more time until I qualify for student housing and can find a nice family to take my dog. However, everyone keeps saying that I am ruining this for her and that I should move overseas with them. She has dreamed of moving for years and is now \u2018able\u2019 to, but especially since her health is degrading, she is losing time to move. Should I give in and leave everything behind or do I stand my ground? EDIT:  Just want to clarify some things. - My relationship isn't new, its 2 years old.  - My dog isn't dying or old, she is just an anxious dog.  - My mom isn't actively dying, she is just getting old and has pre-existing health conditions.  - Yes, I could move to this new country but I would loose the specific program I got into that they do not offer there as well as my scholarship which would put me through Uni.  - I am currently applying to get more government assistance but it would only go into effect after she leaves  - I haven't had a job as my mother advised me not to and originally told me that she would financially support me through schooling  - pet friendly rentals are rare in Australia  - I cannot stay in my current house as the landlord doesn't want a first-time renter staying here.  - My family do not have anything lined up for them in the new place, no jobs, no education, no housing.   - I asked for them to postpone the move until the end of the year so that I can apply for student housing and rehome my dog    ",

We both recently found our niche and audience and have been growing in views in views and followers. What kicked this off was Jacob using a trending audio that sky rocketed his views. I made similar videos (never with the same audio) about the same topic because he and I were really well versed in it. Since his initial video blew up he made numerous other videos with that same audio. All of which preformed well. We both supported each other tremendously and always helped each other with videos whenever we could. Our videos went from 200-500 views to 10s of 100s of thousands. This was big for us as we had been trying to reach an audience for a couple years. But It all changed overnight. One day whole brain storming video ideas, I became inspired but my friends video and decided to make a video using the audio and format from his initial post that blew up. I was excited to tell him about it and show it to him before posting. That night while we were gaming I told him about my idea. His mood instantly changed and I could tell he was bothered. He flat out told me that I was stealing his thing. He asked me if I told you not to post that you wouldn't post it right? To which I replied no. As much as I love Jacob I was never gonna let him dictate what I do and don't post on social media. As in the past he has tried to be rather controlling of myself and other friends. He tried telling me that audio is my thing in this community and you're basically stealing my ir I told him that's how trends and social media works. One person makes something and everyone else copies. He kept calling it my audio when he wasn't even the one who created it. He followed a similar format to everyone else who used it, just specific to our niche. There was a lot of back and forth of him telling me not to but me standing my ground. I went as far as saying \u201cnothing bad can happen to you if I post this\u201d to which he said \u201cyou don\u2019t know that\u201d He wouldn't budge and said straight up I don't want you posting that. It's my thing. I told him I'm sorry but no, you're not gonna dictate this. At the end of the day I didn't end up posting the video, mainly because I was never going to prioritize social media over our friendship. He got off the game when the conversation ended. We still send each other posts every now and again but we haven't had a conversation since then. So am I the asshole for not taking down my post because my friend told me to.",

        "selftext": "My wife, Emma, and I have a 16-year-old dog named Sky who was recently diagnosed with an aggressive, fast-growing form of cancer. The kind that can\u2019t be cut out easily.  Given this, Sky\u2019s age, and other health issues, the vet didn't recommend treatment. Instead, he's got some pain medication to help keep him comfortable, and we were told to keep an eye on the cancerous lump on his chest.  That lump has gone from pea-sized to the size of a large grapefruit in under two months. Sky\u2019s incontinence is more frequent, and his back legs now give out regularly. He doesn't enjoy playing in the yard or chasing a ball and has become fussier about what he eats. He's also sleeping more\u2014up to 22 hours a day. The vet has said as the growth gets bigger, it's more likely to rupture, which would require urgent veterinary care. At that point, it's likely that Sky would need to be euthanized. It's possible that this could happen outside of our vet's usual hours, which would mean we'd need to take him to the emergency animal hospital. Given all of this, I've tried talking with Emma several times about whether it is still in Sky's best interests to continue on. I think the time has come to have him euthanized. This would allow us to ensure that his passing was as gentle as possible, in a place that is familiar and without the added stress of a medical emergency. The vet has said it's up to us, and he'd support whatever decision we made. Emma thinks that we shouldn't put him down just because things have become harder for us. He does still wag his tail when he sees us and enjoys scratches, but the vet has said that dogs can be really good at hiding when they're in pain, and I think that's what's happening here. Emma doesn't see it that way and thinks that because he's not overtly suffering, we should let him live out whatever life he has left. Also relevant: I work from home, so I'm the one at home with him every day. We've discussed what I should do if something happens and she's away for work. She's told me I should do what needs to be done even if I can't get hold of her or she can't get there. It seems she's accepted that he's close to the end of his life but maybe doesn't want to have to be the one to make the decision to end it? Yesterday, I had a sudden thought that I should just tell Emma that something happened during a time when she's not available and take him to the vet myself. It shook me that I'd thought of it, to be honest. Our relationship is built on a strong foundation of trust, and I know that if I were to do something like this and she found out, there would be no coming back from that. Our 20-year relationship would be over. However, I can't stop thinking about how it could be the best thing for Sky. So, I thought I'd ask the internet: would I be the a-hole if I had my wife's dog put down and lied to her about why? UPDATE: Thank you to everyone who has taken the time to share their stories. I really appreciate all the comments (yes, I\u2019ve read them all) and I\u2019m going to take the advice to continue talking with Emma about what\u2019s best for Sky. Hopefully, I can help her realize that it\u2019s time for us to say goodbye but if not, I\u2019ll continue to support them both as best I can through this difficult process. ",

We both even applied to a lot of top scholarship (QuestBridge, Gates, Coca-Cola, etc) and made it to finalist stages for QuestBridge together. In December, Jane matched to Duke University and only had to pay $10,000 over the course of four years. I did not get matched, so I did not receive the scholarship, but made finalist for the Gates Scholarship. This didn't tear our friendship apart but instead brought us closer--I was sad, of course, but I was happy for her. Fast forward to earlier today. She heard back from another big scholarship, and I told her to rescind her application as she already has QuestBridge. She did. Then, she heard back from another, and I told her, again, that she didn't need the money and to leave the opportunity for someone else who did. A couple hours passed, and she comes up to me asking for help with her essay, and I look at it with her. Then, she tells me that it was highly inconsiderate of me to tell her to rescind her applications, especially because I knew how much she needed it. At this point, I had taken two exams back-to-back, and was fed up w ppl. So I told her how it wasn't fair for people like me who didn't get matched, but deserved the money just as much as her. She then says how they have medical bills back from when her mom had cancer, and that it wasn't fair to her family that they pay for her school. I said that she could take a job, both during the summer and in college, so that they don't have to pay for her, but she stormed off. Now, I'm scared that I ruined our friendship, especially with something as small as this.  So, AITA?",

This friend I\u2019ve known since last year but we started to be closer friends this year being my senior year, but for some reason I don\u2019t know how I never noticed but this friend smells absolutely terrible. I try to warn him about this because I don\u2019t want him to get made fun of by other people but he doesn\u2019t believe me because the only people he hangs out with are \u201cweird\u201d kids who I am kind of forced to be friends with because I\u2019m friends with him. And those kids do NOT fucking shower and don\u2019t care about hygiene enough to tell him. I try to assure him I\u2019m not lying and tell him in private so I don\u2019t embarrass him but it just never changes, he lies and says he cleans his clothes everyday but he wears the exact same thing every day. He isn\u2019t financially unstable or poor either, he is able to afford a lot of things I\u2019ve seen in the past. He just genuinely doesn\u2019t believe he smells bad. I feel as though being around him kind of harms my reputation because people will assume it\u2019s me who smells but it\u2019s really him, and I feel like such a dick sometimes for trying to be blunt and honest with him but it is to complete deaf ears. What\u2019s worse is that every morning I sit in this specific spot where I enjoy my personal time before class, but this year he found my spot and there followed all the other kids who also act odd. I started distancing myself from him and sitting in different places trying to avoid him because I genuinely cannot bear the way he smells and the people he brings along. And I\u2019m not just hating on the people he brings because they\u2019re \u201cweird\u201d, they are actually horrible people who constantly talk crazy amounts of shit about me and contribute to rumors spread on me, and whenever I tell them it bothers me they look at me as if I\u2019m fucking weirdo. Also I was planing on asking out a girl who sits near the place where me and him sit, and for some fucking reason whenever I tell him about this he snaps back and looks dead at her and says \u201cWHO HER?\u201d, this was my final straw that made me decide I am done spending time with this guy. I currently sit in a different spot in the morning and I try to tell him it\u2019s for a different reason but he genuinely will not stop talking to me at every opportunity and I just told him one day \u201cBro you smell like fucking shit please stop talking\u201d and he looked at me crazy.

        "selftext": "My nephew (18M) is a a senior in high school. An important context to know is that he is bisexual, as this plays a role in the story. He is best friends with a freshman which I will call Jake (15M). Jake and my nephew have been best friends since the beginning of the school year. They hang out frequently and tend to call everyday to play games. My nephew is bisexual and he rarely discloses this information except people he trusts, like Jake. I was informed by my nephew that Jake's friend, Danny, has spread fear and disturbing rumors about their friendship. My nephew told me that Danny and Jake are in a turbulent spot with their friendship, therefore things have been heated between the two. So Danny has taken note that my nephew and Jake are close buddies, and has projected his anger on my nephew to spread libel about him.  Danny, Danny's mom, and Jake's mom are all linked together like espionage. While Danny and Jake were fighting, he secretly hijacked information between Danny and my nephew's friendship. Please note that Jake and my nephew are not romantically involved. So Danny's mom saw my nephew and Jake riding on an electric scooter together, which she has blown out of proportion in the context that my nephew and Jake are in a relationship. Then, my nephew told me that Danny came to the conclusion he is gay because of a joke Jake made while they all had lunch together. Danny has communicated with his mother in malice of my nephew, and spreads fear about my nephew's sexuality to Jake's mom. Jake's mom and Danny's mom are best friends, and have been in communication about this. Now, Jake's mom is accusing my nephew of grooming and influencing Jake to identifyas LGBT. My nephew has NOT DONE THAT. Now, my nephew and Jake have a strained relationship because his parents banned Jake from speaking to my nephew due to these horrific rumors. Even though my nephew is an adult, I feel like I need to take this to the school. I want to confront the parents for overdramatizing and hijacking information about my nephew's sexuality. With the fact he is 18, I fear they could exacerbate it considering the political climate in the US. WIBTA?",

I'm entirely *okay* with her needing to be alone but she refused to actually admit that or communicate with me until I basically said, either tell me what's fucking going on or take the space you so clearly need already. This started basically two weeks ago. My friend shut down without telling me what was going on. I still don't know the entire story of why she did tbh. Then, about a week ago she said she was ready to talk again and explained a little about how why she shut down but not the whole reason. She said she was ready to talk again but she *very* clearly wasn't. I kept telling her that if she needed more space I genuinely did not care and would give her that, she didn't say she did.  Then these past few days she started replying to the first few messages I'd send then ignoring me entirely the rest of the day. Again I said if she needed space to tell me that. She didn't. This morning she said she's trying to distance herself from everyone and that she's used to being alone almost all the time. Finally it came to a head just a few minutes ago and I called her out. I basically laid it out for her, I said either tell me what's going on and let's settle this or take your space already but stop pretending like there's nothing wrong.  Keep in mind. This is a friend I'd been talking to pretty much 24/7 for the past two to three months. We'd gotten really, REALLY close, she told me things very few people in her life know. I think I have a right to say something, to be worried when she basically disappears on me, comes back, but then *everything* is different than it was before and she essentially says she has no plans of things going back to how they were beforehand. AITA here?  Edit: I sent her this message because I realized pretty quickly that yeah I'm the asshole here, I promise I'm not going to send anything after this but I need to apologize. I've been spamming you with messages, not respecting your boundaries, and, simply put not ACTUALLY listening to what you've been telling me this whole time even if you didn't directly say it. I don't know that I can claim to actually care about you after doing all that. I'll leave you alone now for a while. I hope we can reconnect and fix things eventually but if not I understand ",

Said nephew is obsessed with this Kidoodle app, which contains stuff such as Ryan's World, Baby Shark and Like Nastya. This is something that, while the roommate does find annoying, he otherwise doesn't mind since he's always busy with game modding. However, I've been noticing as of late that it appears the brainrot he's been watching is having a noticeably negative impact on his behavior, especially in school. And I feel like that it's also what's causing his speech learning delay. I had enough of this after a while, so earlier today, I decided to uninstall the Kidoodle app from the TV, and I told him that it had shut down, meaning that those shows were gone forever. Needless to say, he *COMPLETELY* lost it. But I feel that it's for the best. Haven't heard from said roommate yet, as he's been out and about today, but I'm really not sure how he's going to react.

        "selftext": "Ok so I\u2019m really pissed off and disappointed at my bf of 10 years. On Thursday he had to fly from Canada to Jamaica for his grandpas funeral. He invited me to go but decided he wasn\u2019t going to bring me anymore, I was upset he didn\u2019t end up bringing me because he decided to fly with his brothers instead so whatever I had to just deal with it. We have never went on a trip outside of the country without each other so that\u2019s why it was disappointing. I even packed his suitcase and helped him convert money to Jamaican dollars and literally helped him with booking the ticket, even though again I was mad I still did it for him. He specifically told me he\u2019s not going down there for fun, said he\u2019s only there for the funeral and to mourn the death of his grandpa. Tell me why I check his location and he\u2019s at a fucking resort the day AFTER the funeral which is 4 hours away from his grandpas house? When I asked him he told me it\u2019s not a resort, he\u2019s at a hotel. LIES! I google it and it\u2019s a resort in negril, with a nice beach, pools, buffet, LOUD music. Who is he trying to fool? And yes that made me upset because again, he\u2019s there without me and I know he would be upset too if I did the same thing. And LIED about it. AGAIN, I was forced to get over it. So this is the cherry on top of why I\u2019m angry. Before he left to Jamaica, I sent him $200 Canadian dollars to cover what I asked for which was roasted breadfruit, which is hard to find here where I live. I specifically asked for 6 of them which cost less than $5 Canadian dollars. That\u2019s all I asked for. The only reason I asked for that was because I know his mom brings down so much food, she brings more than 6 roasted breadfruits, fruit, a lot of raw fish and bottles of wine and beer. So I know she had no issues going through customs. Tell me why he calls me today, I asked him what he bought me and all he bought me was 1 FUCKING BREADFRUIT. Mind you, I ASKED him and PAID for it so he can make it up to me by him excluding me on the trip. He told me he\u2019s going to have issues with customs and then called me ungrateful. I told him I only fucking asked for that and he didn\u2019t even try to make me happy considering how he excluded me and went to a fucking resort without me and tried to lie about it. Do I even have the right to be angry?? I told him he can keep it for himself and asked for my money back. AITA?Ps the reason I\u2019m so upset is because I have the biggest heart and do so much for him and spoil him and he doesn\u2019t even fucking try to reciprocate it back, I\u2019m not asking for the exact same but at least try. And he fucking didn\u2019t. ",

I (19 M) was talking to my coworker (26 F) about how my ex stepdad/My brother's dad was supposed to help me move in one Friday (he offered because I was living with him), but when I called to ask him if he was ready and he was confused on what I was meaning and he didn't know we would be doing it so early in the day. (it was a little before noon but he was told a week before when and what day) He had to go to one of his younger kids school to have birthday lunch with her which was fine I said we could do it after, but his now girlfriend ( not my mom) said I was trying to ruin her daughters bday and I was an asshole and must of planned it. So he hung up called me back and asked if he could do it Saturday, but I had to stay at a family friends house to watch their dogs and so I said that was fine and I would send him a picture of how I wanted it since I couldn't be there to help him or do it myself. Well he had got there threw it in my room not at all how I sent him and my roomates family had to do it because they felt bad.  I was upset more because they had to do it and I didn't say anything to him about it and still thanked him for doing it... but my coworker said I was an asshole for trying to make him  set up my whole house and I was being entitled. I feel like considering I had it all planned for him but he forgot about it inconveniencing me and then I couldn't be there I was in my rights to be frustrated with him... So am I the Asshole?  edit-  I feel like people are coming at me because I started a fight with him or something but like the the oh post I thanked him for doing it and offered gas to which he said no to, I didn\u2019t argue with him about it but I feel I should still be able to be upset that he didn\u2019t do it when he said he would and told my roommate and her family he knew how I wanted it but didn\u2019t care to do and said I wouldn\u2019t mind in left.  obviously I do mind and he didn\u2019t put like pictures or thing small things like that for me up he just had to put a bed and my desk in there and that was it.

Some of us are learning new skills and breaking into careers while we don\u2019t have to worry about bills. I\u2019ve had issues with my older brother (Jamal, placeholder name) before, but lately, he\u2019s been combative. He talks to our two older sisters behind our backs and seems convinced by them our parents are controlling and don\u2019t want us independent. He\u2019s a pain; he doesn\u2019t say anything bad directly, but he goes out of his way to eat healthily and restrict himself in front of me, making me feel bad about my body and weight. He pretends to be supportive, though. He opens canned beans without our mom\u2019s permission, knowing he\u2019s supposed to ask to avoid a mess. His excuse is he bought it with his own money, claiming he doesn\u2019t make messes (he doesn\u2019t, to be fair). Mom gets mad at me whenever he does this, so I have to tell her, which he doesn\u2019t like since it\u2019s \u201cnot my business\u201d and \u201cthis is a problem between me and mom, not you.\u201d He does the same with eggs, setting aside food for himself to \u201csave time\u201d while working on other stuff, which is unfair. Again, he uses the excuse he bought it with his money, but if I have no money, I doubt he does either. He eats more food than us, but I get the impression he thinks he\u2019s better than us because it\u2019s \u201chealthy\u201d or he \u201cworks out,\u201d spending half his day walking around the house or outside. None of this is good for his mental health, and he never listens to us. After I took a shower, I needed to tell our mother something, so I called her and then yelled her name. Jamal came out of his room, ready to leave, and said, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to bother her over the air purifier. I\u2019m coming downstairs; I can turn it off.\u201d I wasn\u2019t asking about that, so I kept calling her and asked him to open her door. He retorted, \u201cWhat are you trying to pry her off her bed for? You don\u2019t need to bother her over every little thing.\u201d I told him I wanted to tell her something. He opened the door, then walked off. I asked if she was on her bed, and he said no. When I told him to walk inside, he said he had to \u201cbe somewhere\u201d (nowhere). I was upset since he knows I\u2019m trying to get her attention, but he does the bare minimum. I laid this out for him and called him weird for that. He cut me off, saying, \u201cDon\u2019t start this with me.\u201d I reiterated everything and insisted he was weird for not helping. He shot back, \u201cYou barely help me. You can\u2019t be bothered to throw a potato in the oven while I\u2019m outside helping our pregnant sister. How about that?\u201d I reiterated every issue of his while he walked off, telling me this was \u201cpetty and unnecessary\u201d before leaving. AITA  Edit: To clarify, I\u2019m describing how his actions make me feel. He has never outright called me fat; I just don\u2019t like watching him eat the way he does since it makes me feel bad.",

The problem starts in the pandemic when we both started to have serious issues with self-destructive behaviour.Since last year I have been improving greatly and I think I\u2019m finally healing, but my friend doesn\u2019t seem to want to get on the same path as me. I respect her choices but I really want to help her and it breaks my heart to see her like this, knowing that having her around always slows down my healing journey.Last month, she went on vacation and told me she ordered a package online and sent it to my house (without asking me) and I said it was fine. When it arrived, I stored it in a box under my bed. Some weeks pass, she comes back from her trip and messages me to hang out. She specifically asked me to bring the package, and I thought it was weird but didn\u2019t think too much of it. As I was packing some stuff to bring to her house, I opened the box under my bed and noticed the package wasn\u2019t there. My parents called me downstairs to talk and my dad told me he knew what was inside the package. It was something that could really harm her, and I had no idea. I explained the situation to my parents and thankfully they believed I had no idea about what was inside and I thought I was doing my friend a favour. I started to really think about it and I got really sad at the thought of having helped her smuggle the package behind her parents\u2019 backs. I asked my dad for the package and threw it in the trash before going to my friend\u2019s house. When I arrived, she asked me for the package and I told her what happened. She seemed angry at me and was really quiet through our hangout. I asked my mom to pick me up early, and when I got to my house today, she bombarded my phone with messages saying her package had costed her a lot money and demanded I pay her what she spent or buy her the exact same thing she had bought. I\u2019m not really in a good financial position because I\u2019m saving up for my own education\u2014her family is much richer than mine and her allowance is about three times more than mine\u2014and I didn\u2019t want to spend money only to buy her something dangerous behind her and my parents\u2019 backs.

Unfortunately, I already gave that guy money, so I could only pay my friend about half that. Then the other guy with the truck quit and I told my friend just to cover for them until I found a new guy.  I told my friend I couldn't give them any additional money for helping, but I would pay them $1 for each box. They said ok because it wasn't really about the money, it was about helping.After we got the truck loaded, I paid them $1 for every box... after the first 100 boxes. I forgot to tell them that part. The lock on the truck was broken and I didn't want to pay to fix it, so I told my friend to sleep in the truck to keep it safe while we parked it on the Chicago streets until we could unload it in a couple days. They said ok, because they knew no one else would do it and they wanted to keep the boxes safe. When it was time to unload the truck, I had to let her get a head start without me (I had band practice again). They were responsible for bringing boxes up the stairs while I was responsible for telling them which room to put them in (though admittedly I did get distracted a few times, phones right?). Once we got it all unloaded, my friend was helping me unpack because they saw I needed the extra hands. I opened the box marked kitchen and discovered that one of my mugs wasn't in the kitchen box.  I asked my friend where the mug was. They said they weren't sure, maybe it was just forgotten in all the confusion and they could go back to the house to check or look in another box.  I fired them immediately and began telling their friends and coworkers, I don't know for sure that they didn't steal the mug.  So, am I the a-hole? Which is more likely- that my friend did all that work and still stole a mug? or that I gave them an impossible task without supporting her and one item in a sea of items was temporarily misplaced?",

        "selftext": "AITA for cancelling on my friend AGAIN? So me (18f) and my friend (19m) have been friends for a good year now and we met at uni kind of cause our friend groups collided. We have been good friends but our communication is pretty ass on both of our parts.  Now we made plans to hang out at new years at his place, which for me is a good two hour trip and not that I mind the distance but I couldn\u2019t sleep over there cause his roommate would have friends over and they wouldn\u2019t have any space for me. And we couldnt spend it at mine since i would still be moving in and have nothing but a single person mattress and a lot of bags and boxes to get around. We planned this like a week ahead and I did say I might have to cancel later on while planning cause of my dad being in the hospital with a broken thumb and a harsh infection on the stitches. I also told him about my worry for the distance I\u2019d have to travel that late at night, but said I\u2019d let him know about it. Which I did four days prior that I wouldn\u2019t be able to make it due to the reasons I gave him before. I told him I was sorry and that I\u2019d make up for it soon. But all he did was sigh loudly and said \u201cokay, yeah sure.\u201d And before I could say anything else he hung up. He ghosted me for like a week and didnt even show up to the place where our friends meet up for a week and a half. Then he showed up like nothing happened until he asked to talk to me alone and continued to talk about how it was a asshole move to cancel on him like that and acted like I betrayed him last second.  Now I apologized again in that moment and then he said it\u2019s fine and that we could go back to being friends like we stopped because I cancelled.  So a few weeks ago, he invited me to go to this vintage market after college. To which I kind of said the same thing about having to see cause I was a little busy and starting a new therapy trial and could be tired at that time. That day came and I went home early after puking on an empty stomach and he called me the moment I was gonna text him and I told him first thing and he didn\u2019t even say anything before hanging up and ghosting me again and he hasn\u2019t texted me since. I haven\u2019t been at college since then and I follow my classes online cause I\u2019m still incredibly sick and I haven\u2019t been able to leave my house or move too much at all.  I\u2019ve been feeling guilty about it the entire time and I\u2019ve tried to apologize a lot of times through text but he just keeps ignoring me. I feel really shitty about cancelling him a bunch of times and I really don\u2019t know if it\u2019s my fault or not?  So AITA?",

She's been putting off getting a job for a few weeks (she's applied to six over the past three weeks with no response) so my husband and I decided to put our feet down. We gave her until 8:00 PM to draft us a multi-week plan regarding how she plans to get a job (e.g. how many jobs a week? which jobs? etc.) She gave us a half-assed paper that said, apply to 3 jobs a week. We told her that this was unacceptable, and told her that she wasn't even really trying to get a job. She then asked us aggressively how many jobs\u00a0*we*\u00a0thought she should apply to, and I said that she should apply to 3 a day. My daughter then said, well then how am I supposed to devise a multi week plan if I'm already going to be applying to 21 jobs a week? We said that it's still a multi-week plan, consisting of applying to a total of 42 jobs over two weeks. She got very upset at us and cried and yelled, and locked herself in her bathroom for the rest of the night. It was also her job to do dishes today, and we reminded her with a text about this, to which she refused to do them. We didn't know what to do, and are threatening her with not letting her go to her friends debutante ball and winter formal after party.  I just want her to learn to be independent and prepared with some funds before she heads off to college: Am I the asshole?",

The thing is, when everyone is gone and I'm alone in the apartment, I tend to lock the bedroom door bc it makes me feel safer.  Today my roommate was suppose to come back. Well, during the time they were coming back to the apartment, I took a nap after studying for 6 hours straight so i was lowkey drained and completely forgot about the lock door. I'm a pretty heavy sleeper and therefore i did not notice them knocking on the door. They called me once and texted me once but i slept through that. Around 2 hours later, i finally awoken and saw their text. I immediately got up to unlock it and by that time they were hella fricking pissed. I see that I do sound like ah but its not like they were locked out of the apt. idk maybe im overthinking it and i am an ahole. ",

It\u2019s a bit complicated but they remained married still until his passing.

        "selftext": "My 18yo daughter lives at home - as she should since she is not at college or working in a full time job. She graduated high school in 2024 and has a part time job.  She does not drive. My husband and I drive her to work, to her community activities, to hang out with friends, and to dates. She recently asked if she could have 5 people over for her birthday and for a sleepover. We said no. We told our kids that parties are fine through their 18th birthday and for graduation but after that we only have family celebrations. Our reasons: It's a small place and we'd be on top of each other.  After working our jobs all week and juggling her and her brother's activities, we need some calm and quiet. Also, we don't know these kids.  Having them over for a couple of hours is something I can gear myself up for, but an open-ended time of strangers in my space... my heart is racing as I'm typing this.  It makes me super anxious. Daughter knows this (about the anxiety) but has been arguing that it's not a big deal, everyone else does it, and I never have people over.  She has had people over from time to time, but since she and her friends are all dependent on rides, it doesn't happen often. I floated the idea of a 2-3 hour hangout but since she argued with us for about 20 minutes, my husband is like 'nope. not gonna happen. I understand that she's disappointed and wants to hang out with her friends for her birthday. So, reddit, would I be the asshole for not hosting a party for my daughter's 19th birthday? UPDATE 9:55 pm. Some thought provoking questions in the comments. No sleepovers ever? Yes, from around 2nd grade to age 16 we hosted a couple every year - except during Covid, of course.  She hasn't been interested for a few years.  Why doesn't she drive? Lost her driver's license after causing 2 accidents in 3 months.  Thankfully, only damage from the accidents was to the cars; all people involved were fine. However, insurance dropped her and threatened to drop us if she didn't surrender her license. How are you  trying to help her? I've been trying to get her to try for her driver's license again but I'm meeting with resistance.  Talked about the pros and cons of several career opportunities but she doesn't want to have anything to do with it.  Going to counseling, but she seems to use it as a vent session - which can be helpful! - rather than taking the homework and following through with the counselor's advice. Honestly, I know that I need to step up here and take the lead.  Humans tend to do a much or as little as is expected of them; I need to help her raise her expectations. Why isn't she in college? She's not interested in post secondary education right now. She may go back later, and I'm fine with that.  Why doesn't she have a full time job? She doesn't know what she wants to do.  She's currently refusing to look for a full time and I'm not willing to kick her out.  I know a lot of folks do that to their kid when they become an adult, but I don't want to.  I love her and like having her around, knowing she's safe.  Honestly, as a parent I am struggling with how to help her without pushing her away.  ",

        "selftext": "Hi so currently I\u2019m in a situation and I\u2019d like an outside perspective as my family think I\u2019m an asshole!! Sorry in advance if there is any spelling mistakes and punctuation errors, I\u2019m typing this fast as my wife is getting our daughter ready for bed. So I Adam (19M) is married to Keeley (19F) and between us we have a little girl Iris (3F) turning 4 in a few weeks. Keeley and I got married last year after being together for 6 almost 7 years - we got together at 13 and we have been friends since the age of 10 . During our entire friendship and beginning of our relationship Keeley had no minim/ non existent relationship with her dad - he pretty much abandoned her and her siblings and from what she\u2019s told me over the years, he was an absent father throughout her entire childhood. Keeley\u2019s mum met her step dad when Keeley was around 6, and from then on her dad became even more absent and when he would have her and the siblings, she would be the one looking after everyone when only being the middle child. During last year\u2019s wedding preparations Keeley\u2019s dad wanted to walk her down the aisle on her wedding day. I didn\u2019t see the problem with that but Keeley was set in her ways and told me and her entire extended family that her step dad was going to walk her down the aisle and if anyone had a problem with it they would have been uninvited to the wedding. Fast forward to now, I\u2019ve been meeting with her dad, we will call him Ben (46M) every couple of weeks to catch up and update him on how iris and Keeley is getting along ( iris is in nursing and Keeley is going to uni in September to be a nurse). This week when I met up with Ben he expressed a desire to get to know his granddaughter as he said \u201che doesn\u2019t know how long he\u2019s got left) let me preface this by saying Ben has tried to use this tactic over the last to get Keeley to talk to him and as Keeley told me he used this as an excuse when she was kid, when she wouldn\u2019t do something he wanted.. but I don\u2019t know if he is being honest or if he is actually gonna die soon. I guess I want Keeley to talk to her dad, as I didn\u2019t have a dad growing up, my dad died when I was 9 years old - that\u2019s the reason we moved and then that\u2019s when I met Keeley. He wants me to bring iris to our meet ups or ask Keeley to hear him out. After the conversation I went to my mums house to ask for advice and she said i definitely shouldn\u2019t bring up this up to keeley and to stop meeting up with ben. I\u2019m considering just telling keeley everything and dealing with the fall out afterwards.So Reddit, Would I be the asshole if I asked my wife to talk to her dad? I don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t think of this but this is the only relationship I\u2019ve ever been in and I\u2019m actually super close to her step dad.  Edit - hello everyone! I just want to say thank you for all the comments and messages I\u2019ve received. Firstly, I wanna address people this story and account fake - I can assure you it is not, this is my real life and the account is a burner account as I do have a normal Reddit account and I have done since I was 15 Keeley just follows that one so I had to make a new one to address this matter. Secondly, people saying my story doesn\u2019t match up with our ages, we had our daughter at 16, which is almost 4 years ago, I turn 20 on the 16th January and then iris turns 4 on the 25 of February and then the following month Keeley turns 20. Keeley is starting uni in September as she took some time out of education to be 100% present for iris first 9 months that\u2019s the reason she is going. Also when I say iris is in nursery, I mean it\u2019s like a play group thing she goes to everyday, my mother in law takes her for a few hours while I\u2019m at work and my wife is at college. I just also wanna preface this by saying No, iris was never planned, we never planned to have kids till at least our twenty\u2019s, but when we found out Keeley was pregnant we had a long talk and decided that we both could do it and she\u2019s an amazing mum. In the last 3 years Ben has had nothing to do with Iris - as some messages were saying - and it wasn\u2019t due to my wife\u2019s lack of trying, he didn\u2019t want have that relationship with her. Lastly, after reading through all you\u2019re comments I can clearly tell I\u2019m a huge arsehole, Keeley has no idea I\u2019ve been meeting with her father and as some of you have said it\u2019s a huge breach of trust which is completely is. A lot of you are saying that he is using the situation with my dad against me and I never thought of this until it was mentioned. When thinking back to our meetings I can definitely say this is the case, him bringing up how, he thinks that my relationship with my dad would be now or how my own fathers relationship with my daughter would be. The people saying that this is a reason for Keeley to leave/ divorce me is a bit far fetch, Keeley is an understanding woman and she would never do something like that unless it was absolutely necessary. I\u2019m writing this on the way to wok. Tonight when I get him I\u2019m gonna to show Keeley this post, comments and all the messages I\u2019ve received and we shall go from there. I wanna say thank you to everyone who took the time to read this post, even tho I\u2019m a hide asshole. ",

We had a teenage romance in early high school that eventually became an on-again-off-again thing in our twenties before finally completely dissolving at around my thirtieth birthday.  We did briefly get married shortly after college graduation so that she could get on my health insurance, but we were living separately at the time and even dating other people.  Because we've known each other for so long, we'll still get coffee or talk over Zoom 4-5x a year to catch up, but the romantic part of our relationship has been completely buried for close to over a decade. And when I say buried, I mean completely gone. Not even a little spark. We've lived across the country from eachother for about five years now. The meetups are mostly talking about life and work shit and the occasional reminiscing. I'm reluctant to give them up because, gloomily enough, Mandy and I are the only two people from our original friend group that are either still living or talking to eachother. I've been with my current wife (38F, Sam) for around six years. She knows about my conversations with Mandy, and she's given her approval, but I can tell the approval has been given reluctantly.  I love my wife to death and I don't want to make her feel uncomfortable, but I also don't want to lose this connection to my past. WIBTA for continuing this platonic relationship with my ex?",

        "selftext": "I was recently out late night to party with my friends. We found this fancy pub which attracts a lot of tourists - I\u2019m not one as I\u2019ve been in this country for more than a year now. I\u2019m an expat, Asian (brown). We decided to enter the pub. The bouncer was standing right in front of the entrance. I saw him and made a small head nod with a smile proceeding to walk past (which I do usually with no issues at all, kinda always felt like a bar/pub code) while he was parallely saying something to me in the local language which I don\u2019t speak. Note - he didn\u2019t block the way by any means or hand gestures or there was no queue. In a second, I was aggressively pulled from behind, he snatched my backup and shouted with anger along the lines of \u201cYOU DON\u2019T WALK BY WHEN I\u2019M TALKING, YOU DISRESPECTED ME, THIS IS MY PLACE AND YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED\u201d. I was shook by this manhandling incident and apologised to him that I didn\u2019t understand the language and not meant to disrespect him by any means. He furiously said, it doesn\u2019t matter and I\u2019m denied access. I apologised and returned. Firstly, it\u2019s not a local pub, the name is evidently common across many countries and it attracts tourists - why communicate in a local language? Second, even if that was a miss from my side to not attempt to understand what he was saying or informing him I don\u2019t speak the language, was his behaviour justified or AITA? Note - I was not super drunk or unstable or alarming by any chance, also had a decent outfit for a pub and was let in with a smile by the other bouncer in a different pub. Edit - I went through the reviews of this pub in internet and the bouncers are known for their notorious racial discriminations so it\u2019s not a me issue. But nevertheless I will not play the racist card here, because I did misunderstand his communication as an invitation/greeting due to my lack of attention/language barrier. I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019d have got a different treatment if was not brown after reading the reviews.",

        "selftext": "Throwaway account for obvious reasons I (F30) got married a few years ago, and for my wedding, I gave my sister, **Victoria** (F28), enough tickets to invite whomever she wanted no questions asked. The only condition was that she not invite one specific person my fiance really disliked. She understood, and it wasn\u2019t an issue since, although they were friends, she respected our wishes. Now, Victoria is getting married. Weddings in our culture are a *big* deal, huge family gatherings filled with food, music, and dancing, where extended relatives, family friends, and even distant acquaintances are often invited. It\u2019s not uncommon to have hundreds of guests, and the celebration is as much about community as it is about the couple. Victoria hasn\u2019t really asked me for input on the guest list, which I understand, she already knows who she wants there. The wedding is still 9 months away, and I\u2019ve only asked her to invite **one** person. Just one. That person is **Alice**, who is incredibly important to me, like a sister. I\u2019ve known her since i was 10, and she even invited Victoria to her own wedding. However, when I brought it up, Victoria told me she hadn\u2019t invited Alice and wasn\u2019t planning to, not because she dislikes her, but because she\u2019s already over her guest limit. She told me to \u201cwait and see\u201d if there\u2019s space later. Her reasoning is that she hasn\u2019t seen Alice in years and that Alice doesn\u2019t know her fiance, so she\u2019s not on the priority list. But what frustrates me even more is that Victoria keeps saying that it shouldn\u2019t matter because she has already invited some of my friends. While that is *partially* true, the reality is that those friends are also *her* friends, she invited them because she wanted them there, not because I asked her to. I even pointed this out and said, \u201cWell, if that\u2019s the case, then how about we swap out a third friend for Alice?\u201d Her immediate response was *no,* because that person is \u201cher guest\u201d and is definitely coming. I know it\u2019s not my wedding, it\u2019s Victoria\u2019s and her fiance\u2019s decision who they invite. I completely respect that. I\u2019m not angry or trying to demand anything, I just can\u2019t help but feel a little disappointed. With so many people being invite, it stings that Alice, who is like family to me, couldn\u2019t be included. Especially when I made accommodations for Victoria at my own wedding **AITA for insisting she make room for Alice?** EDIT: Since people keep saying. Alice has been a close family friend for 20 years. She and Vic even hung out without me many times so they are not randoms. EDIT 2: Maybe using insist was the incorrect term since everyone keeps pointing that out. We only had 1 conversation about this where I said Id like to have Alice in the guest list and she said no, then we talked about it for 5 more minutes before it ended and I asked her to let me know if she changed her mind. Edit 3: I should have mentioned that we are NOT American. In our culture its very normal that parents and siblings get to invite their friends to the wedding and you are usually sat with your guests during the banquet so its not that weird that I asked about a specific friend.

        "selftext": "So basically 2023 was a really tough time for me emotionally speaking. My grandpa's brother, who we often visited and had great conversations, died in January. That was a really big factor of my mental state, but there were other factors as well. To summarize, my grades were really bad and I was extremely sad and hopeless for the longest continuous period of time in my life, ever.  So, I decided, for some reason, that I'll talk about my problems in the class group chat. The response was immediately dismissive. The crux was that I didn't know what exactly is the problem, I just knew something is very much off. So my classmates were like Why are you talking about your problems if you don't even know what they are? We can't help you if we don't know what you need help with.    In my messages I would describe myself as having a breakdown/tantrum. And I just want to say, I am aware that just because I was in a tough mental state it doesn't mean I'm allowed to drag my classmates into it and do whatever I want. But overall, this has been on my mind a lot since it has happened, and I just want to know what others think. From both sides of the fence.  Thank you!",

There was a moment where a few girls asked if they could sit with us. For context we were are both males. I did not really talk to their group, other than saying hi, and I was speaking to another girl about university and the states. One of the girls from the group, was flirting with my friend I believe and earlier when they first sat down, my friend asked her what she thought of Australia day, and she said Invasion Day... my parents invaded. I understood the banter, but didn't mess with that, so already knew to not engage with them and avoid them. At a certain point I was just sitting with the one girl from the group and myself, as my friend and her's went to get drinks seperately. We started talking about skincare as she saw my lip balm on the table and made a lewd comment about me having it. I told her so you like my friend and she said yeah but was saying what he was wearing wasn't nice. I asked her if she had a boyfriend and she said she was dating a guy, and I asked if her friends had boyfriends and she said yes, and I said oh it's probably best you don't sit with us, but I hope he pleases you (meant it as treats you well, BUT that is a bit weird to say) you and everything goes well. She took offence and said these aren't your seats and said a few rude things I can't remmeber, I said yes but we were here first this is our land, so you can piss off basically taking a dig at what she said before. About 20 minutes later, a member of staff came to me and pulled me aside. They explained I was reported as making an inappropriate comment to a few females and I had to leave. I was taken aback but said yeah of course, because I know better than to argue as it's a strict policy that bars need to enforce. When I was being escorted out I did explain there was a girl I told to girl to kick rocks when I found out she had a boyfriend, although I had been interacting with men/women all night and nobody had complained. I was pretty much sober as I don't like to drink much. The staff that escorted me out apologised and said they felt uncomfortable doing that to me, and I said that they were being professional and it's fine. They said they would love to have me back but as a hard  policy, any complaint is taken seriously. We exchanged names and that was it. I am 99% sure this was why I was kicked out. Whether something was taken out of context is understandable, and to be honest I should have known better to be rude. AITA for telling someone to piss off and getting kicked out, of was this blown out of proportion?",

I (let\u2019s say 25M) recently bought a new bag. It\u2019s a really nice bag\u2014well-designed, stylish, and super affordable compared to the market price. I love it, and I think I got a great deal. A few days ago, my friend (also 25M) saw me with the bag and complimented it, asking where I got it. I just laughed and said, \u201cIt\u2019s a secret.\u201d He jokingly replied, \u201cDid you get it off the black market or something?\u201d I shrugged it off but told him, \u201cDo I look like someone who buys from the black market?\u201d He seemed to notice the convo was going nowhere, so he changed the subject. The next day, he brought it up again, saying he wanted a similar bag but in a different style and asked where he could find one. At that point, I told him, \u201cSince you\u2019re persistent, I\u2019ll guide you to somewhere you might find something similar, but I really don\u2019t like sharing my sources\u2014so don\u2019t ask why. I have my reasons.\u201d Now, here\u2019s the thing\u2014this friend has always been supportive of me and has dedicated a lot of energy and time to help me in life.

        "selftext": "So me (18M) and my girlfriend (18F) has been together a just over a year now, and we both have eachothers phone passcodes. Early on in the relationship I've established that I don't agree with obsessing with celebrities or saving videos of someone you find attractive on social media if you have a partner - she agreed and didn't have a problem with this. A couple times however I've found her doing this. One time she thought I was asleep, she was on her phone and I saw she had a bunch of thirst traps saved (all of the same actor). When I pretended to wake up she deleted them as quick as she could which I found very odd, because now it seems she's trying to hide it. That was half a year ago, but yesterday whilst she was sleeping, I went on her Tiktok. Initially I went on it to troll a mutual friend of ours, I was going to send them a silly message but then I saw that my girlfriend had been sending this friend thirst traps of that same actor from before saying things like Silent repost because my boyfriend would be upset or I fear I would fall for this man but don't tell my boyfriend I said that. I felt so disrespected because she's actively trying to hide it, and this is something she KNEW I would be upset by. Anyways, I then went through her favourited videos and as I thought, a bunch of thirst traps and edits of the same guy over and over again. I know people are going to say You violated her privacy, you clearly didn't trust her in the first place but we've given eachother our passcodes so I don't think it's that problematic, she could've gone through my phone too. Let me know if that's a wrong way of thinking. I confronted her and she smiled and laughed and said you've made yourself sad now why would you do that. She saw I wasn't happy and changed her demeanor, and said she didn't know what to say. We talked and I said how I felt betrayed, she crossed a boundary and how I thought it was disgusting that she was fully aware she was doing something I wasn't comfortable with and tried to hide it. We didn't get into an argument, we were laying in bed saying things individually, taking long pauses to think of what to say, no shouting just calm discussion. When she got home, her parents asked why she was upset and she told them the situation but her parents are very angry at me for going through her phone in the first place, and said that I didn't trust her. She also texted me saying she also thought the same thing but didn't want to tell me when we were hanging out because she didn't want to make the situation worse. I haven't told her I wasn't even planning on going through her phone in the first place but rather just wanted to troll that friend of ours. I know that I should've just left it at that and ignored the videos she sent, rather than going through her favourites. I just want opinions on the situation, am I the asshole for having gone through her phone, or am I right in saying she's in the wrong for having crossed a boundary?",

My brother, Steve (30M), has been dating his girlfriend, Lisa (28F), for about a year now. I\u2019ve never really clicked with Lisa, but we\u2019ve always been cordial. She\u2019s kind of loud and opinionated. She also has a tendency to interrupt people when they\u2019re talking, and it drives me nuts. Here\u2019s where it gets tricky. A few weeks ago, my mom mentioned that I \u201creally should\u201d invite Lisa to the wedding, even though I didn\u2019t initially plan to. I told my mom that I was keeping the guest list tight, and that it was more about the vibe of the event. I didn\u2019t think it would be an issue since Lisa and I aren\u2019t close. But my mom started pushing, saying that if I didn\u2019t invite Lisa, it would be \u201csuper awkward\u201d for Steve and that \u201cfamily is important.\u201d I still didn\u2019t budge, and my mom seemed to accept it. However, I was talking to Steve yesterday, and he brought up the wedding. He casually mentioned that Lisa was upset she wasn\u2019t invited, and that it was \u201cweird\u201d that she was left out when she\u2019s been dating him for a year. He said that it would mean a lot to him if I reconsidered. I told him I didn\u2019t want to cause drama, but I just didn\u2019t feel comfortable inviting someone I don\u2019t get along with to my wedding. He got kind of quiet and then said, \u201cI guess I\u2019ll just skip the wedding, then,\u201d and walked off. Now, I\u2019m feeling conflicted.

Can't I deal with your period pop later? She then got mad at me and told me she needed it and that I was rude and disrespectful for calling her period a period pop. I get that I shouldn't have called them a period pop but I wasn't insulting her or anything. AITA?

        "selftext": "My partner and I live with her mom. She is very gracious in allowing us to live there so we can save money and buy a house. There is however, one complication. We have two cats, and when we moved in we asked that she gets rid of the toxic plants (she had a lot of lillies). Since we moved in two months ago, she has twice brought lillies home. Both times, we just said hey these are lillies can we move them, and she has no problem with that. Another time, she brought home a plant that was toxic, but I can't remember the name and it was shortly after she brought lillies home for the second time. A few days ago, she brought home a new plant that her friend gave her. I assumed that she had already checked the plant to see if it were toxic or not. Today, I looked it up myself and sure enough, its toxic to cats. When I approached her about the plant, I was respectful and just asked something like could you please check to see if the plants are toxic before you bring them in. Her response was saying that she felt attacked, that she didn't do anything wrong, and that because I helped unload her car, I should have seen the plant and looked it up then. (I didn't unload the plant from the car, just her heavy groceries from the trunk). We ended up getting in a heated argument. She was adamant that she did nothing wrong and that its my responsibility to look up the plants she brings in. I don't necessarily disagree, they are my cats and it is my responsibility...and I do look up all the plants she brings in. But after today being the third or fourth time she brought a toxic plant in...I just felt its not unreasonable to ask if she could look it up before hand. AITA? She does have obsessive personality disorder, so maybe her behavior has something to do with that? Or, maybe I'm just an asshole. Edit:  I should make it clear that\u2019s she is not a plant person. She only has like two plants in her house at any given time. She has one on the kitchen window sill( the one her friend gave her), and a bouquet of flowers on the kitchen island. She usually only has the flowers and changes them once a month",

        "selftext": "My BIL (28M) used to live with his parents, paying \u00a330 a week for rent and food. About 18 months ago, he started spending more time at our place after his parents\u2019 dog turned on him. I offered him to move in with us so he could save enough to move out. My husband wasn\u2019t thrilled about the idea, but I thought it would only be for a few months. EDIT we made the decision together, i didn't go against my husband's wishes we didn\u2019t have a spare room, so set him up in our 11y/o son\u2019s room with a foldout bed. We agreed on \u00a3160 a month, which covered bills/food. However he quickly started complaining about doing the dishes (only chore we asked him to do) and spent his money on nights out and other stuff instead of saving to move out. After a few months, it was clear he wasn't saving at all. When brought up, my husband said BIL had until March to move out, he was shocked by the deadline. We offered until end of August, with rent increased to \u00a3250 a month, which he agreed to. But he would consistently ignore basic requests: keeping the bathroom window open when showering to avoid mould, picking up his dirty clothes, keeping his stuff in our son's room organised and not sleeping in the living room overnight, we spend 80% of our time in that room, it's a family room NOT a bedroom. By august, BIL is no closer to moving out which i KNEW would happen. Instead, he booked a holiday, started saving for that, showing he can save and taking us for complete mugs. Rent went to \u00a3400 a month, hoping that would encourage him to leave because we can't just throw him out. He viewed a place, it fell through, and he blamed his friend- told us WE should be having a go at his friend instead as if WE'RE responsible for him. He\u2019s now been living with us nearly 18 months, paying low rent considering everything is included (even toiletries as he has not bought any since moving in). He works full-time and makes above minimum wage. I no longer like being around him, i find him rude, entitled and arrogant. The tension has caused strain between me and my husband, I\u2019ve tried to talk to him about it (A LOT), but he doesn\u2019t want to aggravate the situation, even though he agrees with me. I\u2019m frustrated because every time i broach the subject i feel dismissed and i just need to put up with it until he moves out, even if it means letting BIL act/talk to me in a disrespectful manner. My husband isn't afraid of confrontation but can't be bothered with it as we're stuck with him in house. As he doesn't back me up BIL doesn't take me seriously and i feel like I\u2019m not being supported in my own home. He's had enough of me going on about it, I've had enough of dealing with the whole thing. BIL is due to move out in 4 weeks-he's moving into his friend's (+ friends gf and 4 kids) attic as he never looked for anywhere, the whole situation has left me emotionally drained. I\u2019m wondering if I\u2019m overreacting or if my feelings are justified. Our friends agree BIL is miserable to be around and I\u2019m tired of the cr*p i'm putting up with, should i continue to let it go over my head?",

        "selftext": "So, this just happened, bear with me while I collect my thoughts.  Today my mother recieved a message from her step nephew. Her brother, my uncle, married a woman who already had 2 kids. He cared for them as if they were his own and we've always been close, even though they live in another country.  The message read something along the lines of Tell your family never to speak to my mother again. You should be ashamed of yourselves. Tell your parents their son would be ashamed of them. We were so confused. For context, we are currently on vacation that my grandparents paid for. Just immediate family, my grandparents, my parents, my brother, my husband, me and my son.  My uncle passed away a few years ago and since then, my mother communicates regularly with my aunt. We face timed her for Christmas. Up until that message, we had no indication anything was wrong. Now my aunt won't answer her calls and her step nephew is refusing to elaborate. Here comes the part where I might become an asshole. My mom has asked us not to tell my grandparents. My dad, brother and husband all know. I know because I was there when my mom got the message. I told my husband and my mom told my dad and my brother.  I think my grandparents deserve to know. I think they could shed light on what happened. My nana talks to my aunt all the time, so maybe something happened? They are napping right now, so it will be a little while before I have the opportunity.  We have speculated on causes but we really have no clue.  So, WIBTA if I went against my mom's wishes and told my grandparents about the message? Update: I spoke to my mom again. All of that side of the family has blocked her on all social media. They have not blocked anyone else, at least as far as I know. My aunt has not blocked or unfriended me, nor has her daughter or granddaughter. I hadn't noticed (I'm not on Facebook much) but the one who sent the message, his wife unfriended me at some point. No idea when. We still don't have an explanation, but I thought you guys might like an update. I haven't told my grandparents, as the consensus seems to be that it's up to my mom. And I get that. For now, as long as she promises to tell them eventually, I'll hold my tongue. Update 2: My mom told my grandparents. They are as confused as we are. They haven't spoken to anyone on that side since about a week before our trip. And it turns out my grandparents were about to send a big cheque. My grandfather has said he won't send the cheque until we get this sorted. My nana is annoyed that they used her son against her for what she perceives as no reason. I think I need to add the context that we live in Canada and they live in the US. And the message came on the day Trump instituted those tariffs. We've always had a difference of politics (they love Trump for some reason) but we almost never talk politics with them. My grandfather thinks they will come around once they realize the money has dried up. Also, they were supposed to send my nana part of my uncle's ashes and they never have. She deserves to have her sons ashes. All of this came out as my nana muttered angrily.",

        "selftext": "I (31f) recently drifted away from a friend (25f). I thought this happened naturally, (not hanging out as much / not talking over instagram etc.) but she felt hurt by the distance. We \u201cbroke up\u201d over text after the she sent l an incredibly long \u201cwhat did I do?\u201d to which I responded in summary \u201cnothing really, I feel like we\u2019re just in different parts of life. I wish you the best though!\u201d I realize now this text was the opportunity she wanted to launch into a diatribe of all the things I did wrong in the relationship and that she felt offended by. I had NO idea. One of these things was a miscommunication about driving to the airport. (A year and a half ago!) She messaged me in August 2023 about driving her to the airport at 6 in September. I said sure, even though this is something that I would not normally ask of a friend (I would ask my mom for or get an uber. Gas is expensive!) but I thought \u201cwell, she doesn\u2019t have a lot of family here\u201d so I said sure, you can get me a coffee and we\u2019ll call it even. I\u2019m a morning person so I figured she was asking me to drive her at 6 am. If I had known she meant 6pm I would have not agreed in the first place.  So flight day arrives and I roll up to her place at 6. I call her. Dial tone. Finally I get a hold of her and she says that the flight was at 6pm. We both apologized for the misunderstanding. I go back home to bed. I get up for work and am feeling (understandably?) tired and a bit grumpy. I send her a text saying \u201chey, I\u2019m not upset at you, but I am a bit grumpy about this miscommunication and am going to have to politely decline to drive you at 6pm tonight to rest\u201d I gave her notice and she replied \u201ctotally fair, I\u2019m so sorry for the mix up!\u201d and she sent me a starbucks giftcard for my trouble, which was a sweet but totally unnecessary gesture. She got to the airport, I wished her a nice vacation, and we caught up when she got back. I thought all was well.  Folks, all was not well. She had apparently held on to this resentment as \u201cI broke a promise\u201d to her. She said me cancelling was selfish cause she couldn\u2019t afford an uber and was shocked that I didn\u2019t rearrange my schedule to drive her at 6pm. She apparently had to take a bus and then get another friend to drive her \u201cwho dropped everything for her\u201d. She was flabbergasted that she \u201csent me the giftcard and then I cancelled! WHO DOES THAT?!\u201d Apparently I didn\u2019t prioritize her and didn\u2019t care about her feelings and wellbeing as I knew how much this trip meant to her. I looked back and she sent me the giftcard after I declined to drive her. I thought it was a nice gesture at the time, but now I feel like she felt like I owed it to her to say \u201caww, since you got me coffee I WILL drive you now\u201d. I thought this was a simple favour that I could revoke cause circumstances changed and not \u201ca promise\u201d. I am doubly confused cause she said over text that it was fine at the time. Am I the asshole for not realizing this was a dealbreaker? ",

        "selftext": "My niece Jay(10F) was the only Granddaughter when my mother died in 2020. When she died, she wanted my niece to have her porcelain doll collection which had around 6 dolls. These porcelain dolls were around when I was a child and I had memories of getting in trouble for playing with them. They were absolutely beautiful. Well, when my mother died I (29F) decided to keep ONE doll, I know it wasn\u2019t left to me, but I felt like they meant more to me than they could to my niece. I contemplated giving it back to her when she was old enough to appreciate it. We\u2019re from Louisiana and hurricane Laura hit \u2026 when we evacuated. I took the doll with me because I knew it was sentimental and irreplaceable. My niece, however let all of the remaining five dolls get ruined in hurricane because she let them in the house when where got ruined. My twin sister (Jays mom) thanks that it\u2019s only fair that I give Jay the doll. I kept safe because after all it was left for her\u2026. My argument is that if I would have gave her the doll, it would have gotten ruined with the other ones because she didn\u2019t care enough about them to take them her with her. Fast-forward, we are now in 2025 and I have a daughter of my own. I 100 % believe if my mom would have known she was gonna have another granddaughter she would have left a doll to her. AITA? ",

        "selftext": "My (26F) parents own the 2-bedroom condo I live in, and my boyfriend (28M) moved in a few months ago. We discussed rent beforehand, and he was fine with paying. I initially told him $1800,  in addition to splitting utilities 50/50. He agreed. For context, comparable 2-bedroom condos in our area (a desirable part of Southern California) rent for around $2800, meaning $1400 per person. My parents aren't charging *me* rent, which is incredibly generous. However, they see the condo as an investment property, and the rent they would charge me is factored into their financial planning. I send them a portion of the rent I collect every month. I also pay the HOA dues and property taxes (which are substantial in California). Everything was fine for a few months. Then, my boyfriend was looking at rental listings and realized that *individual* rooms in comparable condos are going for around $1400. He also found out (from me, I wasn't hiding it) that I technically don't pay rent myself since my parents own the place. He completely flipped out. He accused me of trying to profit off him, saying I'm taking advantage of him because I'm not paying rent. He argues that since I don't have a rent payment, the $1800 is mostly profit for me. He thinks he should only pay half of what *I* pay in combined HOA dues, property taxes and utilities. I admitted that the $1800 wasn't just based on splitting a theoretical $2800 rent. I told him I added a bit extra because I'm the one paying the HOA fees and property taxes, and I\u2019ve been responsible for general upkeep of the place. I also have to send a portion of the rent money to my parents. I acknowledged that it's more than half of what a comparable room would cost. He's not having it. He keeps saying I'm ripping him off and that I should only charge him half the combined HOA, taxes, and utilities. He\u2019s now refusing to pay the agreed-upon $1800 and is only offering what he calculates as his share of the combined HOA, taxes, and utilities. I feel like I'm being reasonable. I'm not trying to get rich off him. I'm just trying to cover the actual expenses associated with the condo. Am I the asshole here? Should I just lower the rent to appease him, even though I feel like I'm not doing anything wrong? This is making things incredibly awkward. EDIT: There is no mortgage. My parents bought the place cash as investment property. I have been living here rent free for about 8 years and have done some remodeling at the time, and have had friends as roommates here and there whom i also charged rent, but usually those cases were when those friends were suffering financially so they paid under market value.  My parents did not ask me to charge my boyfriend rent or for me to send them money, they basically say it's my choice to use the place as I want for now.  I send them 1k a month because technically it is their place and so I feel they should get a share of the rent. EDIT - UPDATE   For everyone assuming/asking if I am pocketing the money. NO I AM NOT.  It;s like this:  I send 1k to my parents since it's their place, and every time I've had a roommate I've sent them a portion of the rent without them having to ask. BECAUSE they bought this place as an investment property. I was originally going to fic it up and rent it out but stayed longer than I planned and they have never charged me rent. So I am holding them back from it being a full time rental property so of my own initiative I am sending them rent whenever I have roommates before they can ask me for it.  1k to parents $500 - HOA dues  $100-150/mo utilities Property taxes - somwehere between 5-10k/year So I'm usually left with $150-200 every month after paying my parents and HOA and utilities, and even combined over a year it would still not cover even half the property taxes, which I am willing to keep covering fully myself.   I am not pocketing anything or making any money from what I charge my boyfriend for rent. ",

        "selftext": "I 40f and my husband 42m have two wonderful kids 10m and 7f.  Our kids have never been the best of friends or even got along that well most the time, they would bicker and argue with each other call each other names and do things they knew annoyed the other to purposefully get under their skin.  I don't want to go in to detail but we've had some financial issues lately that caused a bit of a strain on our marriage, we would argue a lot late at night when the kids were in bed and often wouldn't go to bed ourselves until 2 or 3 :am ( even when we had work the next day).  I'm ashamed to say that it turns out our kids would often wake up and hear our late night arguments and this actually gave our daughter nightmares, I found this out when I went to wake my son and saw his sister in bed with him, that's when he told me she had a nightmare and got in bed with him because my husband and were still up fighting.  This broke my heart to know we made our daughter scared and weren't  there to comfort her,  we made sure to keep our arguments as quiet as possible and reasured our daughter that sometimes mommy and daddy fight but she didn't need to worry about that and everything would be okay.  We kept our arguments to a minimum and were as quiet as possible, but our daughter still had nightmares the next few nights and got in bed with her brother.  We were able to get a handle on our financial issues and stop fighting so much. We reassured the kids that  everything would be okay and that they didn't have to worry. After a few nights our daughter was back to sleeping in her owne bed.  Ever since then our kids have gotten much closer, they play together, watch shows together, goof around together, and treat each other with much more love and respect then they used to. They even hug each other goodnight every night.  They still have arguments and bicker but it's much less and they  have an overall very loving relationship.  Today my daughter drew her brother a picture of the two of them playing in our yard with the words  best big brother in the world written really big on top.  My son loved it and showed it to us and asked if we could have it framed, as I mentioned we have been having financial issues lately and I really don't think we could afford to frame it.  I told him he didn't need to frame it, he could just hang it up on the wall. But he said he wanted to frame it because special pictures get framed and this is the most special picture he has. I tried to tell him gently that we can't afford to frame it but he and his sister are still upset.  I asked my husband about it and he said maybe we should get it framed because it's so special to our son and there new found closeness could maybe be hurt by us refusing to frame it.  The last thing I want to do is hurt there new close relationship but I still don't think we can afford to get it framed.  AITA? Edit: We went to Walmart and got our son a frame for his sister's picture, we put it up on his wall right across from where his bed is and he absolutely loves it!  We're very glad his relationship with his sister is so much better and seeing her picture for him everyday means so much to him. We're so glad we were able to get a frame for him.  Some of you seemed to get the idea we were just cheap or that we just didn't want to spend money on the kids, that's absolutely not the case. The kids have lots of toys, their owne bikes and phones and of course all the essentials.  My husband and i didn't realize that there were options for cheap picture frames but we were delighted to find out there were.  Thank you all! ",

We would hang out on week days and every weekend together and now having that divide was crushing. We still kept in touch and stayed close, communication just got harder as years went on. She has recently graduated, started college and a job. I am so proud of her for all her achievements, she is one of the smartest people I know. A few months ago she got engaged to her 6 year long relationship with her boyfriend Rob ( 20 ). I was ABSOLUTELY ecstatic!!! To see her beaming for joy was a beautiful heartwarming thing. He proposed to her around all their friends when they went on a camping trip. How cute, right? She face-timed me to tell me and show me the ring. I jumped up and down and squealed for her hahaha. A few months after she was talking to me about plans for their wedding. They decided to hold off until they both graduated college to officially get married. I think that's a very wise decision on their part. After telling me this, she proceeded to say- \u201cOh btw. Destiny ( 18 ) is probably going to be my Maid Of Honor. Hope you aren\u2019t upset.\u201d I won\u2019t lie, it was like a slap to the face and it did hurt. Her and Destiny became friends when she moved to Maine. They\u2019ve been friends for around 7 years now. It hurt me only because I feel even though she\u2019s been great friends with her, it would make more sense for me to be that since we\u2019ve had a close friendship of 11 years going on 12 now. I didn\u2019t want her to feel I was trying to be an ass or poison the conversation on something exciting, so I kept quiet for now. I waited a month and I couldn\u2019t shake the hurt I was feeling. Since she moved I felt a bit like I was now the \u201cPast\u201d so to speak. I texted Macy- explaining how I truly felt and how I wasn\u2019t trying to create issues, but just voicing my feelings. She told me she was never trying to hurt me but that Destiny just meant a lot to her\u2026.but don\u2019t I as well? She told me I could still be a bridesmaid but it was just the bluntness and putting a friend she hasn\u2019t known for as long in that position that truly just hurt me and made me feel off.  Am I the asshole for being upset about this? ",

        "selftext": "For a little context I met my BF in high school. We dated off and on early in our friendship but over the past 12 years aside from a short Covid fling we\u2019ve been solid long distance buddies. There was a discussion about moving in with BF in their town to restart my life. BF always thought I should get out of my old city. I said no that I couldn\u2019t live in a small town. Last year BF brought it up and told me that was an ask to try to get back together. This has been in the back of mind, but I never acted on it. Well over the past month BF returned into my life full time for a bit. First was visiting parents and secondly we planned a cruise in my friend group. I started catching feelings during the time we hung out. It fully set in over the cruise. Not sure exactly what I was feeling at that time, but I figured I had time to sort myself out. Turns out one of the people(NG) we met on the cruise made a huge impact.  What was supposed a short stay at the beach post cruise with three friends left over turned into a scene out of a romance movie that would have the whole dinner table turning heads to listen. My other friend and I became background characters to GF and BFs vacation. It had classics like a spontaneous a road trip and sleeping on the beach. I did not handle it well. The first few days BF noticed and pointed it out. I confessed after some prodding and BF was very nice about it. GF listened to me babble and made sure I was ok. That bit of honesty, however, unleashed a torrent of emotion I didn\u2019t know I had. I became a vacuum of negativity. It got worse as I literally had front seats to their growing flirting, whispers and lack of presence to others in the group.  The lowest was when BFs new partner tried to warm up to me and give me \u201cwe can talk about anything that\u2019s bothering you\u201d line. Having the person who swept your crush off their feet try to console you is a torture fit for one of the nine hells. The last night before we all flew back my BF decided to ditch the group for hankey pankey while we were on the understanding that we would hang out before going our separate ways. Radio silence till 7am next day. When they got back I lost it and said things about BF being selfish and making the whole trip about themselves, rubbing their relationship in everyone else\u2019s face until they couldn\u2019t be bothered to have is around. Couldn\u2019t show some restraint for a few days? There was a \u201csorry you felt that way\u201d apology. I shut down and left for the airport by myself in the morning as BF and NG shared a shower in our hotel. I got a tearful phone messages saying that BG doesn\u2019t want to lose me and that I can take my time to pieces things, but no apology. I\u2019ve blocked her, for my own sanity but I felt disrespected. I probably should have said something earlier. Maybe never say anything at all and pack it down. Crush or not I find it hard to see me as the asshole here for expecting some restraint. I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m the asshole, but how big am I?",

If you don\u2019t, here\u2019s a quick rundown, basically Doug Ford is sending $200 to every citizen of Ontario, by mail, as a way to convince them to vote for him.  Today, my older sibling (23 NB) got their bribery cheque in the mail, my parents still haven\u2019t gotten theirs and so it became a topic of discussion between my dad and I.  My dad mentioned that in his and my mom\u2019s bribery cheques is also money for me (nearly 16 F) and so naturally I asked to have access to this money, and my dad said no. I then messaged my mom as she\u2019s usually the more reasonable of the two, and she said that because I don\u2019t pay taxes it\u2019s not actually my money.  My birthday is in less than a month and because it\u2019s my sweet 16 I\u2019m planning to go all out, my mum knows this and I said that this money would make everything so much easier for me as I\u2019m paying for my entire party out of pocket, she said \u201cexactly because we pay for everything it\u2019s our money.\u201d  Imo, the least they could do is keep the money for when I\u2019m 18 and actually do pay taxes. Maybe I\u2019m just understanding wrong but my dad literally worded it as \u201cmoney for you\u201d that they just won\u2019t give to me.  AITA?  ******EDIT*******  Thank you to everyone who responded and helped me see how I was in the wrong, I misunderstood because my dad had said that it was my money, I messaged my mom and apologized to her.

The law in my city states we get 2 free months of rent in these situations. (15K in our situation)  But the new owner wants us out faster than that and offered us $30K to be out at the end of the month. We took it but now we have to divvy up the money. My thinking is we should take the first 15K and divide it by what we pay for rent normally, then the extra 15K on top will be split evenly 5 ways.  Everyone else thinks we should split the entire 30K by how everyone pays rent. Which i think is ridiculous, because that extra $15K was never part of the plan. No one should be entitled to a percentage of something they didn\u2019t pay into? They\u2019re thinking about it like a business, an investment. But rent is a bill, not a business. That extra money came about purely bc of a situational issue, not bc more money was \u201cinvested\u201d I feel taken advantage of by my friends and even my own boyfriend.  EDIT: the extra $15,000 is coming from the new owners not our rental property manager, it\u2019s not tied to a rental agreement",

        "selftext": "I (F 28), and my finance (M 27) are getting married in April in Mexico. We planned a huge brunch for our friends to ask them to be a part of our wedding party back in March of 2024. Everyone of course said yes, however, as time went on, a groomsman needed to back out so we needed to backfill the position to make it equal for our wedding party to walk down the aisle. Of course, it didn't bother me that my brother-in-law was not initially asked because my finance does have a lot closer friends that he has been friends with for years and we hang out with every weekend. When going over who my fiance was going to add to his side of our wedding party, he mentioned asking another friend of his, I told him it should be my brother-in-law and not his old best friend. Some background, my fiance and my brother-in-law are pretty close, we see him and my sister quite often as my sister is one of my best friends, and our kids (6) are the same age and hang out all the time. This friend that my fiance wanted to add to his wedding party was a really good friend of ours when we first started dating, he and his now finance were some of our best friends that we hung out with every weekend, however, we stopped hanging out with them both for about two years as the friend would make comments about me being a stay at home mom and living off my finance. Me and my fiance both agreed that I would be a stay-at-home mom while I finished college. Fast forward to today, we reconnected with our friends and after a serious apology from my fiance's friend we started to become a part of each other's lives, We only see them maybe once or twice a month, so I was confused as to why my fiance would want him in our wedding over my brother-in-law. I understand that they were best friends for years, and this is his side of the wedding party but my brother-in-law has always been there for us and never has done us wrong. So am I the asshole for asking my fiance to have my brother-in-law over his old best friend?",

One of my housemates really likes ambient lighting and I've had to ask her to take a motion sensor light down in the hall and on another occassion she took another light down after I suggested a compromise. So now in our living room she's put 3 lamps which are just exposed, high strengh lightbulbs (with no shades). To be fair I almost never use the living room, in part because of anxiety but also in part because our other housemate (who is now moving out) has anger management issues so it wasn't a great vibe. But I was hoping to actually socialise with the new housemate who I have mutual friends with. I also had to take my migraine meds when she left the door to the living room open with one of the lights on but tbf she's now moved it out of view from thedoor. WIBTA if I asked her to get rid of the lamps from the living room/move them to her room? I think I might be TA because I've already asked her to remove lights from common areas, she's spent money on them and has them in a room that I barely ever use. Edit: So for info I'm not against any light, in the previous situation I just asked to have the overhead light on instead as I can just wear a cap. But I see that people are right that I am/would be the asshole, thank you for the feedback. ",

But we\u2019ve worked through a lot this past year and I know he is trying to put in more effort. He told me recently that he was going to pay someone to come deep clean our house as my birthday present. To be fair, I have said many times that I would love to have this done but it isn\u2019t something we need to be spending money on right now so we haven\u2019t done it.  He followed this up by saying that if I didn\u2019t want to spend the money, he would gladly just take the whole day and do it himself. When he told me this, I wanted to be very mindful of my reaction. Again, he has not been in the habit of gift giving or being super thoughtful when it comes to special occasions. I told him that I really appreciated the thought and saw the effort that would take for him to do but if he took the entire day to clean the house, I would obviously just be watching my kids and trying to keep them from coming behind him and messing all of his hard work up and ultimately that doesn\u2019t sound like a present. I felt guilty because I want to praise his effort but I also feel like this \u201cgift\u201d doesn\u2019t feel personal or thought out well, despite the effort.

In this group there are 2 people which I will call Laura (F) & Paul (M). They are both in their early thirties. I have been very close to them. My relationship with Laura is based on a lot of compassion, laughter & we are basically telling each other almost everything, she helped a lot at the beginning when I started and she believes in me.  With Paul the relationship I would say have been a bit toxic but good, as I was always afraid of how he would react, he would give me a lot of advices based solely on his pov. He never really tried to understand me as a whole (I struggle with mental health), a lot of tough love I would say.  Early December we have decided to buy a common gift for a birthday. Laura has bought a gift. Everyone gave the money, except for Paul . When she confronted him, he stated that he's been really struggling financially & big family issues. She tried to understand but for her it was not a valid reason and he should have tried to communicate instead of ignoring her. Paul owes me a significant amount of money too. Paul has been ignoring my texts for 2 weeks and being very avoidant at work. He finally replied and I was shocked. He stated that I should have said something to her and basically I am bad friend for not taking his side and he was more there for me than her (which is not true) & he's taking his distances from everyone as our establishment will close in 2 months.  I told him I didn't want to be in the middle of this (I have a past with this), you are both my friends and I simply can not choose. He is forgetting that I have helped him in the past, I was there for him. He didn't understand he chooses to stop talking & unfollowed me on social media. I don't think I will see my money ever again.  Laura has been very supportive, understood I will not take sides and our relationship has not changed.  I have lost a friend, but AITA for not taking the side & being more supportive ? Thank you for reading.  Edit: names for clarity",

There was a rumor not too long ago that really made everyone in the gc dislike him but we found out that of course the rumors were fake. Still I felt weird about him. S had been talking to Z for a long time and says that his a genuine, nice, kind guy. Z had been asking S out to get to know her better and to finally talk to her in person but S would refuse but then finally she gave in. He even stated that if she felt uncomfortable seeing him by herself that she could come someone, which is what S did. They're probably on the that date right now as I am writing this. So when R told us in the gc that S was going out with Z of course people in the gc didn't see an issue since S had clarified time and time again that Z was not a bad person. Still as I said I still felt weird about him. I have a lot of trust issues with men since I've seen a lot of trashy men with the women around me.

L and R were the one's that were going at it, I'd chip in here and there giving my two cents on the agreement but the argument ended, or so I thought. This morning the argument resurfaced again since L had told said, (my name) is hater of men so S don't listen to her My friends already know how I feel about men and this is a joke in the gc so I didn't take it the wrong way. We started joking once again me, R and L in the GC I had said, before you girls go looking for a husband or man with nothing to your name go look for money first I really just said this as a joke not think someone would get offensed to this. I left the gc after saying this since I have things to do around the house after a few hours I come back to the GC to see an argument between R and L. R was saying that before you get married it's better to be financially stable, L was saying that you just need to find a good man and saying that getting married doesn't mean one needs to stop improving themselves. After a while they found out that they were arguing about the same thing but just from different perspectives.  R asked L why they're even arguing to which L proceeded to reply to my previous comment about looking for money instead of getting married. She said it seemed that I had an inferiority complex to which R replied asking how. L proceed to say that it must have rubbed her the wrong way and the conversation ended there. I didn't want to say anything in the GC so I texted L privately asking her how my comment rubbed her the wrong way and how she felt. She is yet to reply to me and when she does I'll update you. But from this AITA?",

        "selftext": "English is not my first so language. So, I've been feeling down for a while and have not been able to pull my weight in our household.. so last night I pulled myself together and did my best to clean the floors downstairs since she was complaining she wouldn't get it done...I know this was due to my lack of action, I'm probably the jerk there, which is why I wanted to give her a worryfree weekend and do the floors for her.. I could only do the floors tho, no dusting or whatever... it's not even dusty since I did it last week..I even told her I would do them next week (I leave tomorrow for the weekend) My mom came back from school an immediately began pointing out what hadn't been done and said nothing about what I did do until I pointed  it out. This isn't the issue,the issue is that I woke up to use the bathroom and have to walk by her room, apparently she was awake and called me over. She started by saying how it bothered her that I cleaned the floors and it kept her up all night. I know how she is and this is usually how fights start, so it being 6am I was quite agitated as I was not in the mood for this so early in the morning. Anyway, she told me she does not appreciate what I've done, that this was not what we agreed upon, why didn't I do the surfaces like I was told, why did I clean the floors, now she's stuck spending the weekend dusting and so on and so forth. At this point I exploded because for the 100th time, it's obvious she doesn't listen to the words coming out of my mouth. I told her I was not doing this at 6 am, that I wanted to go back to bed before my alarm went off. Her answer? Then my day is ruined and I'll have to cancel everything because I can't sleep like this..  At this point I exploded and I might've evolved into the jerk.. I called (screamed) her manipulative and that I am not doing this so early in the morning. That I was digusted that she would be acting like this over me trying to do something nice for her. She told me I didn't do it for her, I did it for myself to manipulate HER and what was she supposed to do this weekend? Guys, I was honestly flabbergasted.... I was like anything you want?!  Apparently, she can't do anything she wants now because I manipulated her by doing what I want and now she has to dust and clean the surfaces... I.TOLD.HER.TWICE.AT.THIS.POINT. that I would do them.  The conversation was going nowhere and I didn't want the cops called on us for our screaming match this early in the morning, so I cut the conversation short and removed myself from the situation, which..made her even more mad but at this point I didn't even care, I was hurt and angry. Back to my room I went. I just.. I'm at a loss..am I really such a manipulative monster for what I did? Am I in the wrong? Was my thinking off? Should I have just done the stupid dusting? It may sound stupid, I know it does... So here I am..",

        "selftext": "This may be kinda long so I apologize in advance. So for some backstory my girlfriend has a friend (Sarah) who had a roommate (Cate) living with her and she had a cat there that she left. Eventually Cate moved and abandoned the cat basically leaving Sarah to take care of the cat for months by herself. I heard many bad things about Cate and her cat but that's just what I heard anyway; I'm at a party with my girlfriend and she's with the lady's in a room when she come into a different room with me and the guys saying that Cate said the cat was pregnant then threw that cat and said she didnt want her anymore! I wasn't there but I believe her when it comes to stuff like that she had a cat for 14 years and she's very passionate about animals. The next day Sarah calls my girlfriend and says the cats throwing up and unfortunately had worms and wasn't pregnant. So Me and her take the cat to a shelter because we can't afford to do the surgery and all that but wanted what's best. Now I'm adopting the cat but Cate is now looking for it claiming she wanted the cat. Am I in the wrong for kidnapping this cat? Sorry for the long post and it may not be the best it's my first. Edit 2: incase I wasnt clear Me, my girlfriend,  and Sarah talked about taking the cat up for Sarah when we heard it was sick. We didn't just straight up steal it but in this context yes it's stolen  Edited namesAlso names changed obviously for privacy reasonsTldr Friends roommate abused cat (allegedly) and we took her so the cat stays safe.  UPDATE: I HAVE DA KITTY!! She's doing much much better now and she's become a huge cuddlebug:p Still recovering from surgeries and stuff but she's much happier! Thank you all for your feedback and if anyone is interested I can update on the kitty.",

She was really upset and kept saying she felt worthless and unloved. I tried to comfort her over the phone, but she was inconsolable. In the moment, I panicked and told her I\u2019d take her out on a nice date today to help her feel better and take her mind off things. The problem is, I\u2019m completely broke right now. I have less than the equivalent of\u00a0$5 in my bank account,and I promised her a date that would cost atleast $40. I didn\u2019t want to let her down or make her feel worse, so I thought I\u2019d figure something out. I\u2019ve been scrambling for the past couple of hours trying to come up with the money like selling some old stuff or considering borrowing from a friend but I\u2019m still short. I can\u2019t ask her for money because she\u2019s completely dependent on her family for her expenses and I don\u2019t want to burden her. I feel like an idiot for making a promise I can\u2019t keep, but I also didn\u2019t want to leave her feeling hopeless after what she went through. I thought the promise would give her something to look forward to, but now I\u2019m worried I\u2019m just going to disappoint her even more.

I'm 16 rn so it's probably just some phase but I just really can't stand him nowadays, I was mad at first because he said something he shouldn't have to my mom but I honestly don't even care about that anymore since it's been over a month. He's apologized enough already but I'm still admittedly disrespectful/argumentative towards him or I just ignore him when he tries to get close. Maybe it's stress from some other stuff I'm dealing with but idk why I'm still feeling like this, like nobody loves my dad more than me. It hurts especially to see him as he's wondering why his daughter isn't taking to him. So anyways if anyone can relate or help me out that would be cool.",

        "selftext": "New account because I'm pretty sure my step dad is chronically on reddit. I (17 F) have a cat named Fluff and have had him for at least three-four years. He was originally a feral the neighbors had picked up from the road; never took care of him and me and him eventually bonded so he chooses me over anyone else, even after we moved to our new house around last June. (This is important for later) Along with Fluff, we had another cat who passed, named Lynx. He was also from the neighbors. On day one of begging to bring my cats to the new house (they were going to ditch them and leave them to be neglected) my step father (36 M) said they were **my cats** and they'd be my responsibility. They paid for their food only (i paid for vet visits, even when i didn't have enough money to buy my own stuff); i paid to put Lynx down and cremated after he got sick since i didnt have enough money to give him the proper treatment for maggots and didn't want him to suffer. I just recently bought Fluff a tracking collar and a carrier, explaining to my step father (lets call him Jack for jackass) when he asked that I would be taking my cat with me to college. He got angry and berated me for a while, saying what he says goes and that Fluff would be unhappy with me and that I'd go nowhere in life. In the midst of his desperation, he even offered to buy me a kitten and to pay for the shots.  The problem is, I don't want to replace Fluff with a new kitten, and he doesn't see that. Jack hardly even looks at my cat (which, btw, hes saying its HIS cat now) and I'm scared that when I leave he's going to be neglected again. Fluff has gone through a lot for a 5 year old (roughly around) cat already, and I don't want him to be scared of being around the house again (hes an outside cat since he was a feral; ive been training him and he does well. Jack left him out during the harsh winter storm we had a bit back.) I'd have a dorm and I could legally register him as my emotional support animal; and this would all be in another year or so after i try to get income to save. So, reddit, WIBTA if i took my cat to college with me?",

My dad's back at home for his break, but he's thinking about getting a job closer to town (he works like 7 hours away from our home) and we can be a happy family, right? Wrong. I always get scared when he comes home because he can get aggressive sometimes and him and mom always fight. Whether it's about money or cheating allegations (which I'll touch later on in the post). But I've heard many, many stories of them being soo in love (mostly my dad because he went after my mom first). So I've been thinking, what if they divorced? I mean dad did joke about it once and because of that joke I had a dream they divorced. I don't want them to get divorced, but whenever dad's home I feel like...it's just not it. Anddd sooo, I am a snoopy little shit and I recorded one of their arguments to see what was going on and maybe if I could help. Here's the tea. My dad's a chef and works in the kitchen and yup, he works with plenty of women. And this woman that he worked with got a foot surgery or something like that, from what I could pull from the recording and he asked if he could massage her feet... Dad says they were joking or whatever and says my mom was always jealous. Which to be fair, my mom accused him multiple times of cheating, but dad always says that bullshit that she needs to trust him blah, blah, blah..OH AND BTW HE DOESN'T SEE A PROBLEM WITH HAVING A BUNCH OF GIRL FRIENDS AND A PASSWORD ON HIS PHONE THAT MY MOM PROBABLY DOESN'T KNOW (\ud83d\udea9).I did feel guilty afterwards because I recorded something that was really private. I'm just a dumb kid. I can't fix a failing marriage. I don't know what to say to them or do. And if I'm being for real right now, I wish my dad would still have his old job. Yes, it was...a good pay (ig idk much about finance) and we lived a happy stable life, but he did work a lot like 9 AM to 10 PM almost every day. And I mean I still felt sorry for him even after everything he had done. It's really distracting me from school and I don't know who to tell or even how to strike a conversation about it.

I knew I wouldn\u2019t be able to get out of dressing up somehow, but I at least wanted a cool outfit like a black suit with a gray shirt or something. Definitely not a white shirt and absolutely no stupid bow tie. But my parents are saying that since I hate formal clothes anyway and won\u2019t wear them again before I outgrow them, they don\u2019t want to waste money. We had a fight about it, but no chance, I have to wear the full suit. I teased my cousin back then when he had to wear it. He hates formal clothes like me, and I made fun of him, said he looked like a choirboy in that outfit and that I would never let my parents force me to wear something like that, especially not a stupid bow tie. Now he\u2019s already super annoying because my parents borrowed his suit for me. I told him I\u2019d only wear it without the bow tie and without the vest.

But Amy had a habit of talking over people and cutting them, which ticked Sarah off A LOT. After 3-4 months, we finally confronted her about it, and Sarah went really low contact with Amy. Although i did want to continue being friends with Amy, i went no contact with everyone for a solid 2 months. After this, we slowly started talking as i took the initiative and contacted her, apologized and suggested to reconcile. She agreed and we agreed to meet up. On the day of the meetup, my parents needed me for some things so i had to cancel. Then we changed the dates, but my doctor's appointment was finalized on that day, i thought i could meet up with her after that, but doc was out for lunch and returned half an hour later, which is why i canceled it. I asked her today whether she'd be interested in meeting up, but she declined saying that i had disappointed her twice. Since we're in a very tense and delicate situation, I'd like some clarity.AITA? Update: After being schooled by everyone here, i spoke to Amy. We exchanged perspectives and she said that she felt guilty about the whole ordeal and it never occurred to me that she wouldn't be angry at me, but at herself. I told her that i fumbled real hard(\ud83d\udc80) and that I'll respect whatever her decision is. And unfortunately for some people who were expecting Amy to cut me off, (bless her heart) said she'll consider it and tell me what her final answer is soon.

        "selftext": "Hi AITA, I have a 5 year old cardigan corgi. He\u2019s an absolute unit, and as my friends say, he\u2019s high in strength/constitution and low in intelligence/wisdom. He often tries to eat things that aren\u2019t safe for him.  I live alone and hired a dog walker I found on Rover to visit him once a day during the work week. Instead of going through the app, I agreed to pay her in cash. She\u2019s generally been great. But, we\u2019ve had a few mishaps like her not telling me when my dog ate and tore up a wooden hand fan. I\u2019ve given her the benefit of the doubt because my dog loves her and enjoys his walks with her.  Last night, my dog vomited up five or so partially chewed, large, bright-orange seeds. They are from the coontie plant and are in the same family as sago palms, which can be fatally toxic to dogs even in small amounts. Unfortunately, they are part of the landscape in my \u201cdog-friendly\u201d apartment complex.  I decided not to wait it out and took my dog to the emergency vet. They admitted him to critical care because the risk of him deteriorating was so high, even though he was in good spirits when I left him.  I messaged my dog walker to let her know what happened, and she insists she never saw him eat the seeds and that she tries to prevent him from eating things on the ground. I know he did not eat the seeds on my watch, because I exclusively took him to the turf-only dog park yesterday, which isn\u2019t near the toxic plants.  This emergency vet visit is costing thousands of dollars. I haven\u2019t brought up the cost to her yet, but WIBTA to request that she contributes to this huge expense? I get it\u2019s my dog, but also I have never let this happen on my watch. I understand it was likely an honest mistake, but also I feel as though it\u2019s really irresponsible to let someone\u2019s dog eat random things off the ground, especially if you aren\u2019t paying close attention.  Edit \u2014 Thanks everyone for your feedback. I will absolutely accept that I would be TA if I asked my walker to contribute to my vet bills. I had several people in my life reach out and suggest I ask, hence this post.  I will not be asking her to pay. I will, however, invest in good pet insurance and will only pay dog walkers through Rover from now on.  I will clarify a few things for the sake of this post. - Yes, I pointed out the unsafe area. - Yes, she knows he will eat things off the ground, but she also knows he is trained and responsive to several commands including \u201cleave it\u201d, \u201cdrop it\u201d, and \u201cwait\u201d.  - This plant is only in specific parts of the complex, which are easily avoidable. - Yes, multiple sources have confirmed this was a life-threatening situation for my dog due to what was ingested.  Edit Part 2: Electric Boogaloo \u2014 Thank you AGAIN for everyone\u2019s feedback. My Hoover of a dog is doing okay, his labs look good and hopefully he\u2019s coming home soon.  A few more things I\u2019ll add: - I will absolutely be investing in a muzzle.- like some of you have suggested, it might be worthwhile to invest in a more vetted walker (instead of Rover)- I am very blessed, and my low rider Unit of a dog\u2019s bills are paid (yes, by some of the very people who asked whether I was going to ask my current walker for compensation)- I walked my apartment complex\u2019s property this morning. On the very far side of my building, there is a line of these palms that were apparently just trimmed, and there are huge piles of the seeds all lined up. Dog walker admitted to letting my Dyson Dog \u201csniff\u201d the seeds, so \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f- it\u2019s a moot point because there are lots of things I will do moving forward to prevent this from happening again (boy I\u2019m dense, I genuinely don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t think of a muzzle in the first place \u2014 I\u2019ve used things like grazing muzzles for my horses before). - Medical scares and renewed agency are one hell of a drug. - I do want to say, I\u2019ve truly been trying my best. I came here for feedback, and I got what I needed to move forward and keep my dumb dog safe. Reddit gives me tough love, and even when it stings, I\u2019m grateful. - I talked to the front office staff about the plants. If anything, maybe some signs can be posted. ",

        "selftext": "So I (20M) am in university and have a friend (19M) that I met last year, and we have always been great friends.It\u2019s worth noting I also have a girlfriend (18F). So basically, there\u2019s this game show called Traitors, and I like watching it. So me and him agree to meet at 9 for it. This might sound weird, but me and my girlfriend like to sleep on call together, and she had an early start so fell asleep at 9, although we were talking for a little after.Then my friend came down, and he said \u2018What the heck?\u2019 and I told him to give me one second, but before I know it he\u2019s telling me to f*ck off, flipping me off and leaving.I then tried to message him after and I feel I got called every swear word under the sun, saying how I ditched him to be with my girlfriend. I am a serious people pleaser, so I was trying my best to resolve the situation, and then he texted he forgave me and we can move on. Although, ever since that day, he hasn\u2019t been the same. He acts the exact same around the rest of our friends, but he doesn\u2019t speak to me, acting like I don\u2019t exist. I honestly wanted to soothe things over and figure things out.This became evident to the rest of my friends in my friend group, so I told some of them everything, and so far everyone is on my side.But I don\u2019t take it at face value. I think it\u2019s worth clarifying, I\u2019ve never seen this man flip anything off in his life. And very rarely swears. So I want to get your guys\u2019 opinions. Am I the asshole?I appreciate you reading this! \ud83e\udef6 Edit: Thank you for reading. And thank you for your comments, whether it\u2019s calling me the asshole or not. I taken the points on board and had a chat with him, and we have since made up for it.The main reason I came on here is because I wanted other opinions, because although my friends were telling me I was not in the wrong, I needed perspectives from another view.Thank you again, and I hope you all take care! \ud83e\udd0d",

        "selftext": "I (17F) have two friends, A (17F) and R (16F), and we have a group chat. We\u2019ve been friends for a long time and know each other\u2019s boundaries. My main boundary is that nobody tells me how to live my life.  For small context, the school system here sucks. I have ADHD, and learning was very difficult for me. I was also harassed by a boy in my freshman year and had other bad experiences. School hurt my mental health, and I felt increasingly depressed. So, in my Junior year, I dropped out. After that, I felt happier, more confident, and my art block was gone. R mentioned my decision to drop out and encouraged me to return, saying I would struggle and regret it later. I explained that school wasn't for me and that it had been difficult for me, but R replied, I get you don't like school, but I don't like it either and yet I still go.  Frustrated and hurt that R didn\u2019t understand my feelings, I asked them to stop talking about school. Today, R and A were discussing summer jobs and asked when I would apply for one. I told them I wasn't looking for a job because I wasn't interested in working right now. R reacted strongly, calling me crazy and insisting that getting a job would be beneficial and something I should consider. She mentioned that there are people with disabilities who can't work, which I found unnecessary. I explained that I'm too stressed to maintain a job and that I'm busy with my art commissions. The pressure to finish my drawings is already overwhelming, and handling a job would be too much. I reassured R that I don't think I'm crazy for my choice, and I plan to get a job in the future when I feel ready. We decided to Agree to Disagree and left it at that. I called a friend, D (16), to share what happened and my feelings about it. D said my feelings were valid and encouraged me to confront R. I wrote a honest and respectful message to R, clearly stating my boundaries and explaining how it hurt to have them broken. R replied with a dry Okay, won't bring it up again. A contacted me, saying I made R feel stupid and like an asshole because of my response. A said I acted immaturely and could have handled the situation better, which I admit is true. They told me R didn\u2019t need to apologize and that I was in the wrong, expressing their concern and worry. While I understand their worry, I felt my boundary was crossed and that someone was constantly criticizing how I should live my life. This made me angry, and I yelled at them in a voice message before blocking them on most social media. Some friends think I could have managed it better, but D thinks I was valid in feeling upset. I\u2019m torn because maybe R did care, but I dislike being controlled and treated like I won\u2019t succeed just cause i wanna be happy.  AITA?",

Her preferred method of traveling is without him (I won\u2019t get started on my thoughts about that).My birthday is Middle of Jan and hers is 5 days later. Last November she decided she wanted to go on a trip for her birthday. Conveniently it was \u201cfor our birthdays even though I went in support to what she wanted to do and we traveled all day on my birthday.  When she brought up the trip in the beginning, I mentioned my son going and that he would be really interested. She gave 100 reasons for him to not go, and asked if I still wanted to take him\u2026.  \u201cUmmm yeah\u2026\u201d she flipped out. Said if he comes, she wants to go to Hawaii for 3 weeks without him. I tossed it back at her and said if he doesn\u2019t come, can we do a family vacation for 3 weeks to Hawaii with him \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd2f, yeah didn\u2019t go over well. Well we got home and she came up with the e idea of going on a trip with him (omg) for spring break. Blew my mind. It was also interesting how quickly she wanted to go on vacation when her trip cost 3 times as much as we had expected.  So today, I had shots in my shoulder because of some sever pain, one side effect is it makes it hard to sleep (had a shot Monday and Tuesday woke up at 4, and today I woke up at 5). I\u2019ve also been sleeping on the couch because it\u2019s more comfortable with my shoulder. So tonight, I had been sleeping and at midnight, she scared me really bad because she just plopped down next to me. I jumped and opened my eyes and her face was a foot away staring right at me.I was like \u201c5#%!, you scared me!\u201d She said she didn\u2019t mean to, and went straight into talking about a hotel she found and how much it is per night blah blah blah. She asks what I thought, and being super tired and my heart pounding still, all I could think of was \u201cI was sleeping\u201d She jumped up, stomped off swearing at me yelling about she\u2019ll never want to do a family vacation again\u2026 Now I\u2019m lying here wide awake wondering AITA?",

        "selftext": "For New Year I (29F) decided to surprise my mom by coming home on NYE, as I just had a baby, her first grandchild, and have dinner with my family. I told my sister (23) I was coming, and wanted to order some food for everyone to eat. I searched for the best price and found a menu for $89.50 for 10 people. Apparently, the minimum order for these type of menus is 10, and they give you big trays of food. I asked her to split the bill with me, and told her that they could keep the leftovers to eat that week, and in case any of our friends wanted to hang out, we would have something to offer. At first she said she was not willing to pay for more food than we needed, and that she wanted to find another option for less people or where they would sell individual plates. IMO I thought the option I found was a good offer, but agreed to let her find another option. After 3 days I asked her if she found something, but she never even looked. We were running out of time so I told her I was going to pay for it and that she could pay me her half, which she did. I told my two best friends I was arriving on the 31st and I invited them both over, and told them we would have some food. My sister also told me she invited her BF over, which was perfectly fine. Flash forward to NYE, I was traveling home and told my sister that my two friends MIGHT come hang out but was not sure, to which she answered asking if they were going to put some money for the food. I said no, we already paid for it, and there was more than enough to share. I then asked if she would ask her boyfriend to pay for his dish. She said he was not coming anymore, but if he wouldve came, she would in fact ask him for the money. She said, and I quote, why do I have to pay for your friends' food if the whole point of ordering that much was for us to keep the leftovers to eat the rest of the week. At this point I was flabbergasted & in shock of her attitude and told her I was NOT going to ask my friends (one who was picking me up at the airport on New Years Eve, and the other who even when I was not there, would visit them bringing food and baked goods to share with my family) for money; that if she was in so much need of $18 I would give it to her when I arrived. To which she answered in a voice note CRYING telling ME I was an AH, was not empathetic with her and her situation and that she was extremely sad of my lack of consideration (the vn was 3 min long but that was basically the summary). At this point I was over it and about to take off so I just didn't answer. At the end of the night, neither of my friends went to my house. Four days later they ended up THROWING THE FOOD AWAY because it was too much and by the second day my sister was sick of the same thing (my mom\u2019s words so IDK if my sister actually said this). My husband agrees that the whole thing is insane and in my opinion I think it is miserable to be fighting over food and less than $50 \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f so Reddit, am I the asshole?",

I know C didn't care about me telling him. While I appreciate responses, I realize I should have been more clear in my wording.That being said, my issue is the principle of me saying Do not repeat this and him instantly involving himself. If I had told him something that was a secret, obviously he couldn't keep one. That's it, that's all. **  I'm so worked up. So help me reddit, AITA?

Couples consist of me and my boyfriend, C+J, and S+S Lately the 2 other females in this friend group have been getting into it. C confided in me about their argument, and I told my boyfriend about it tonight while we were hanging out. Before I even told him anything, I literally started by saying Do. Not. Repeat. This  Well I left his place and he was already messaging C about it by the time I got home. He brought the very thing I said do not repeat to, up, not even 20 minutes after I left. Now, C doesn't care I'm sure, but my boyfriends obviously clueless what do not repeat means. He kept saying C was fine with it, and he thought I meant do not repeat this to S+S..  So after I was flabbergasted he brought it up, he really gave me a half ass apology and was saying things like Considering we're in a relationship she'd  know you would tell me, and that I'm being juvenile, and the whole thing is crazy, I'm making a way bigger deal out of it then I should be and how C didn't say I couldn't tell him so therefore it doesn't matter.   Honestly I kept saying this wasn't about C, it's the principle of me literally asking him not to repeat it, him saying he understood and then going and doing the exact same thing I asked him not to. He doesn't get it. I didn't realize I had to say every person's name for something to not be repeated.  If I'm in the wrong for making a big deal about this, I'd love to know.. AITA?? ",

        "selftext": "This argument happened in a previous relationship, but I still think about it and wonder if I was in the wrong. I, a 21-year-old woman at the time, was dating my 22-year-old boyfriend, Zach. Zach and I had been dating for about 1.5 years, but we were long distance due to college. So, when we were in the same state, we were inseparable. One night after we had sex and were about to fall asleep, I rolled over to find Zach playing a car video game on his phone. I cuddled into him, hoping he\u2019d put the game down, but he kept playing. I jokingly said something like, \u201cI guess I\u2019m more boring than the game.\u201d He laughed and explained that he played this game most nights before bed, like how some people read or watch shows to wind down. He said it wasn\u2019t personal and not to take it the wrong way. Over time, this became a regular thing, and I started to feel uncomfortable with it. A bit of context: I\u2019m queer, and at the time, I had a strong preference for women. Zach and I had been friends for years before we started dating, so while I loved him, he was the male exception for me. Because of this, I was particularly sensitive to things that might turn me off when it came to intimacy. Eventually, I got frustrated and told him I wasn\u2019t okay with him playing phone games in bed. I said he could play, but not while we were naked together. He then argued that he needed it; it was part of his nightly routine and helped him unwind. I told him that was stupid which was not nice and he totally shut down. I felt bad that I couldn\u2019t just let this go but it was starting to effect our relationship. Was I the asshole for not being able to get past my boyfriend playing video games in bed?",

        "selftext": "My gf (23F) recently mentioned to me (23M) that she wants to have a night out with her friend from school. I asked her what the plan was and if she wanted me to go too. She said it was implied that I was invited but that it is more of a girls night. I asked who she was going with and it was her friend who she has told me some stories about. The stories were basically that every time they went out together this friend would get super drunk, try to get w dudes every time and would leave my gf alone for most of the night. Now idc that a single girl is going out and doing her thing, we\u2019re young and she\u2019s allowed to put herself out there ofc. But how am I supposed to feel comfortable with my gf going out w her after hearing all this? I do trust her, understand that they are not the same person and don\u2019t think she would cheat on me or anything like that. But how could I not be thinking she might end up in a shitty situation where she\u2019s alone in a college bar and I can\u2019t do anything about it? They\u2019d also be going out about an hour away from us. My gf would be driving and I told her honestly if she went out near us at least I could pick them up and that would make me feel way more comfortable. But this girl is still in school so she\u2019d go see her at a bar near the college which is another problem cause why would you drink and drive? She said she wouldn\u2019t drink that much but still. I told her I\u2019d like to go so I can meet her and get the chance to see what she\u2019s like for myself. That way if she\u2019s cool then i wouldn\u2019t care if they went out together because i\u2019d know her better at least. My gf said she\u2019d feel fine if i went out w my friends, but the difference is we don\u2019t go out really ever like that, they\u2019re all in serious relationships and she\u2019s met all 3 of them. She then said she\u2019s not going and it\u2019s fine, but clearly was upset and was making it obvious. I just don\u2019t want to be controlling and feel like i\u2019m holding her back from hanging out w her friends, especially cause she\u2019s been going through it recently in her personal life.

        "selftext": " Me (26 yo female) and my boyfriend (24 yo male) have been dating for 5.5 years. We are currently on vacation in Hawaii and to save some money for excursions and food we decided to rent a car through a more budget friendly place. The first car we received had a cracked interior and scratches and bumps on the exterior but ran and worked so we didn\u2019t think too much of it.  But then we started to notice some sounds that made us concerned that the bearings could be messed up or who knows what. So we asked the rental car place about it and they gave us a different car. This car was similar condition but it has the check engine light on. As soon we we noticed that, my bf said it\u2019s fine and we shouldn\u2019t worry about it. But I was concerned and encouraged him to please ask the rental car guy. So he reluctantly did and apparently all the rental car guy said was \u201cit\u2019s fine, but if it starts blinking on and off there\u2019s an issue so call us\u201d. I personally don\u2019t feel comfortable renting a car with a check engine light on, I don\u2019t care that it is a discounted rental car place, that doesn\u2019t mean that you should accept a car that has a check engine light on. But my BF used to work in a car shop years ago and he isn\u2019t concerned. I know that the check engine light being on could mean a myriad of different things from things that aren\u2019t concerning to things that can be a safety hazard. Personally, I am worried that while we are driving in an area without service (there are a lot of them) or when we are driving on the road to Hana or some narrow winding single lane trail with cliff edges and no guardrails, something is going to go wrong. He doesn\u2019t seem to be concerned about it and I am encouraging him to please drive us back to the rental car place and ask for a car without a check engine light on. He told me if I want a different rental car, he\u2019s not coming and I will have to go 30-45 min back to the rental car place by myself once we get back (even though we will be close to the rental car place on our way back to where we are staying). I truly think it is rude how he is not taking my concern seriously and is unwilling to switch out for a different rental car or at least ask them and telling me I have to do it (he is the one who made the reservation). He thinks I\u2019m entitled and that I\u2019m just upset I\u2019m \u201cnot getting my way\u201d. Am I the asshole? UPDATE: just thought I would let everyone know that my boyfriend agreed to ask the owner if he knew why the check engine light was on and if they have a different car for us to use. We went and the owner said he does not know why, and offered another car with a check engine light on. We kept ours for another hour or so, during which the seals on the front doors loosened so there was wind loudly on each side, there became an identified issue with the shifter in which we could not switch from reverse to drive and slid backward for a moment into oncoming traffic, and the whole area on the driver side holding the lock/unlock and window clickers pulled off when my bf closed the door. We asked for a refund which the owner gave us and rented a jeep through budget car rental.\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc",

When she got home from school, I surprised her with everything I prepared, gave her some small gifts, and specifically asked if we will be lighting the candles on the cake together with her friends. She said yes. Her friends come to celebrate. She immediately sends her little sister (11F) to her/my room, as she wants the living room for herself. 3 hours go by, no cake is being cut. Her sister is upset (telling me, as she is not allowed in the living room) she is really waiting for the cake. I say this to my daughter. Half an hour later, her and her friend are singing happy bday, she blew out the candles, they cut the cake. (Not even the one I made - her friend brought another one). She doesn't call me or her sister. She doesn't offer me a piece of the cake. She completely ignores me (I am in my room).WIBTH if I told her ***tomorrow*** she was extremely rude for leaving me and her sister out of the celebration? When we thought we would be included, at least in this small part of it? BTW- she is planning a bigger party to celebrate in a couple of weeks, and she asked if we could let her have the house and go to my parents - and I said yes, as she is a very good kid, I trust her and I don't mind her having a party without her family. I am just really upset she didn't include us in this case, without letting us know in advance.",

So house b I took the computer my brother has from his bedroom to my bedroom since he hasn't used it in a long time, I didn't ask which I know is wrong but I thought Id return it a few days later since I'm only using it to play games, and even if he notices, I'm not moving it houses, just to my bedroom in the same house, so even if he needed it, I could just put it back within a couple of minutes. Anyway I was using it to play games and went to he gym in which I came home to find him asking why I moved the pc and I said just to paly games, since my one in House B is really slow, in which he told me to do bad things to myself, I was taken back and kind of shocked and we bickered and I said I'd tell my parents what he was saying in which he'd say he'd stell them he didn't say that stuff, I'm really shocked by what he said, there was nothing dodgy on the pc btw incase that's your initial thought, I think he's on steroid s for the gym so it might be roid rage but anyway AITA, initially I think I am but what he said is just unacceptable and I don't know if I should tell my parents, as I haven't spoke to any of them in  a few days, my parents know something happened between us, but in the moment he just said I stole his computer and am a liar. I'm really debating telling them as I don't know if they'd take his side of the story and I'm stressed about that or if i should jsut be honest and whoever they believe is not on mem I'm also stressed when they do believe me as I don't want him kicked out or something.

Recently the amount of arguments have increased, dare I say I never have issues with anything and am generally relaxed, however sometimes my SO thinks I'm Too chill and don't stress enough (Which I figure would be a good thing? I just don't see a point in stressing because either things can be fixed, or they're out of my control).  Anyway, today we were in the kitchen and I was washing a couple glasses and we were about to make dinner. She needed a small bit of hot water and I turned the faucet into the sink tub closest to her that I wasn't using. I had the temperature in the middle and about middle pressure too as I was only cleaning a few glasses.  I turned the temperature on hot for her, and considering she only needed a little bit I kept the pressure on medium. She turned the pressure on max, left it for a few seconds, put it back to medium, then got her little bit of water. I asked why she did that and she said it Makes the water boil quicker. I said pressure doesn't, it's whether the temperature is on hot or cold and it would have been hot on the pressure it was on when I gave it to her. She said I was wrong but I insisted.  Lo and behold, argument (On her end). I'm a c word sometimes who never believes her (It's a faucet, there's no conspiracy?), she doesn't want dinner anymore, and she's leaving to either go to the gym, or in her words Park somewhere to get away from you.  I'm confused as to the escalation and if I should have just left it. I didn't say anything in a 'Condescending' tone at all. I said it so monotone and normal like it was just basic conversing. Am I the asshole that I should have just said, Okay you're right and left it? Or is standing my ground about the basic use of a faucet valid?  ",

In all honesty I wasn't really close to carl and I was just having fun playing games with him but there were moments were in where we play and we both would start shouting at each other for fun but there was one instance where in I said sorry to him for how I acted and he accepted it. And after that I just tried not to shout as much and just enjoyed playing with him. And recently during the past few months while we (my other friends and I with Carl) would be in a call carl would do the carl wheezer voice, at first It was funny and we all had some good laughs but at some point I started to resent the voice of carl wheezer and it started to get annoying to me and just a few hours ago carl entered in the call and he was speaking then he used the carl voice again and I told him if he could not do the carl voice anymore cause It's triggering me, I was trying to tell him in a nice way but in the end he just left. I asked a different friend if I was an asshole for saying that and they said yes. I explained myself to them that It wasn't even carl who I don't like but his carl wheezer voice impression and now I feel like spiraling so bad to the point that a different friend said that he (carl) would understand but at this point I don't know if he will because because I just saw that he left my personal server. So like what do I do??? Like am I really the asshole??? I just tried to speak my mind about not liking the carl voice so that he won't do it?? ",

My middle sister continuously makes jokes about my wedding.(This middle sister also happens to be one who eloped for her second wedding and didn't tell me until after it happened, yet when I announced my engagement said I better be maid of honor) I finally said something to them and asked why they didn't seem to be taking thingS seriously. Were they mad they weren't bridesmaids? I also asked what they had against longer dresses, as I think they look classier, and my oldest sister finally told me You can't expect us to dress so specifically if we're not part of a wedding party. You don't get to have those expectations This is the only thing I've asked of them that leans towards more of a wedding party task I guess. I haven't asked them to throw any pre-wedding parties, haven't asked them to help decorate or anything, and I had even planned a sisters weekend bachelorette party for us. AITA?",

To The point I couldn't leave the house alone became very depressed. It made me so delusional and like I was in a bubble. I didn't consider looking for work but I was quite adamant I'd go to university. But been rotting away at home on my second gap year.  However in these past few weeks I feel as if I'm snapping out of all of this and starting to realise that I may have used mental health as an excuse (I still have issues but I should've taken accountability), and maybe laziness is a factor. My depression and anxiety make me so irritable at my family my parents whove housed me and the fact they favour my little sister over me clearly (who is in still full time education), they tell me they can because she's actually doing something unlike me. Then I have thoughts that keep me up thinking what a disappointment I am considering all my parents have done for me they absolutely have all the right to favour my little sister.  I claim unemployment support and with saving that I've passed my car tests and now looking for a job which is very little progress but big for me considering I can't even leave the house without dying of anxiety. My parents see their friend's children and my dad bought up that his friend daughter who is a year older than me has a mortgage and is buying a house. (in this climate and accord to everyone my age that is kinda rare as its so hard to even find a job). I asked something and he misheard me saying so what and started shouting at me saying what have you done? You live off us? or something like that.

My mum said to my dad he shouldn't compare me to others because she knows someone who's daughter is a graduate, yet can't get a job also due to anxiety. The other day he told me that all I do is eat and sleep and shower which felt like an attack despite being the truth it hurts so bad because they've kinda codled me for years and now are finally making me see sense. I feel scared my parents even saying the truth of my life to me comparing me to others can trigger a depressive episode again. They are right by reminding me that I haven't achieved anything but I feel they are going about it the wrong way ",

        "selftext": "I have two children: Donna (21F) and Austin (19M). Both live at home but also stay on campus at their respective colleges. Austin has a girlfriend, Bridget, whom he\u2019s been dating for nearly a year. Early in their relationship, Bridget stayed over once while Donna was at school. With Donna\u2019s blessing, Bridget slept in Donna\u2019s room, and Austin stayed in his own. They chose to sleep separately, and there was no drama. This winter break, both kids were home. Toward the end of break, Bridget returned from out of state but couldn\u2019t move back into her dorm yet. Austin asked if she could stay with us for a few days. I agreed but mentioned we\u2019d need to figure out sleeping arrangements since we don\u2019t have a guest room\u2014just mine and my husband\u2019s room, Austin\u2019s, and Donna\u2019s. Austin said he and Bridget now share a bed, but his twin bed would be a tight fit. Donna has a full-sized bed, so I suggested Donna and Austin switch rooms temporarily. Donna could use Austin\u2019s bed, and Austin and Bridget would stay in hers. I assured Donna I\u2019d change the bedding afterward, but she was visibly upset and asked why Austin couldn\u2019t just sleep on the couch. I told her it was only for a few days, and since Austin wanted to share a bed with Bridget, this arrangement made sense. When Bridget arrived, everything seemed fine at first. That night, Bridget went to bed early, and Donna pulled Austin aside in the kitchen. I couldn\u2019t hear the start of their conversation, but Austin suddenly started yelling, \u201cShut up! Why would you say that?\u201d before storming into the living room. He loudly announced he\u2019d never invite Bridget back if \u201ceverything\u2019s such a problem.\u201d When I asked what happened, Austin explained that Donna asked him not to have sex with Bridget in her bed. He claimed he had no intention of doing that and accused Donna of being weird and trying to cause trouble. Donna said she had purposely tried to talk to Austin quietly to avoid a scene and hadn\u2019t said anything to Bridget. She also said it wasn\u2019t unreasonable to ask, given she knew Austin and Bridget were sexually active. I told Donna she didn\u2019t need to make such a big deal since I\u2019d already promised to wash the sheets. Donna became upset and ended up staying with a friend for the rest of break. School has since resumed, but Donna is barely responding to my calls or texts. Austin told me Bridget overheard the argument and now feels uncomfortable being in our house or around Donna. My husband said Austin caused the scene by yelling and pointed out that Donna wasn\u2019t out of line for making her request. He also said I should never have let Bridget stay in the first place.AITA? ",

I was telling my friend about this story and he called me weird and said he wouldn\u2019t talk to me until I stopped this activity. I think it\u2019s a simple fun activity. AITA?",

        "selftext": "I (40m) have been in a relationship with my partner (43f) for four years. Over the last year and a half, we\u2019ve had constant issues with and disagreements over communication and it\u2019s been having a very negative impact on our relationship. For context I am autistic, and she has been aware of this from the beginning of our relationship. She\u2019s knows that I have difficulty with implied meanings/hints/subtext, and to properly communicate with me effectively she needs to use clear unmistakable language. Last month we had another disagreement over a prior conversation we had via text. She claimed that she had asked in said conversation for me to go buy some groceries for a dinner we were planning to make together, and I told her that I would go to the grocery, but she never asked me before that moment. She got upset and repeated that she had, and I responded saying that we had the conversation via text and she in fact had not asked me. At that point she shut down and went to get the items herself.  Following this incident, we had another face to face conversation, and she mentioned showing the previous text conversation to her sister and a friend to see if she was in the wrong, and said they both agreed with her. I considered doing the same and asking my friends, but I know that they\u2019d just co-sign whatever I said, and so I\u2019m here with a throwaway for unbiased opinions. Including a copy paste of the previously mentioned text conversation since attachments aren\u2019t allowed. (Gf)\u201cAlso, I have the final ingredients for the roast, red potatoes\u201d (Me)\u201cWhen do you want to make it, and do you have any side dishes you're interested in preparing alongside the roast?I can pick up further ingredients and we can make them together\u201d (Gf)\u201cI picked up potatoes. It's roast Potatoes Cesar salad And maybe some green beans Pavlova for dessert We can make it on the 17th. Since you are off\u201d (Me)\u201cOkay that sounds good\u201d Did she actually ask me? Was it implied? Am I just being an unreasonable asshole?  Edit for clarity on how the text was laid out.",

I also play video games and some of these games involve a lot of clicking, like Monster Hunter, Marvel Rival, and League of Legends. My roommate is irritated with all the clicking and has asked me multiple times to just not play the games while she is in the room. Now I have made accommodations for her, like not playing games while she is doing schoolwork, not being on the phone while she is doing schoolwork, bought new headphones so I could speak quieter at night while on Discord with my buddies.  She still calls me inconsiderate and selfish for not ceasing the clicking while she is in the room because it bothers her and is super grating to hear She confronted me about it today and we got into an 'argument', but I told her I would not stop because I enjoy playing games. Some things that I do that I know are bad habits though, is I will lose track of time and stay up pretty late (12am EST at the latest) but I am not super loud, or yelling or anything past dark I have some screenshots that I am willing to share if I can  UPDATE: We have both said our arguments and apologized for our harsh words. We have come up with a compromise, we will keep our no games while studying and add on so that after 10-ish pm, I will not play the clicky games such as Rivals, League or Monster Hunter. We have also decided that if something else comes up, we will discuss it there and then instead of letting it fester and becoming a problem. Thank you guys for being so mean to me lol, it helped open my eyes and suck it up and talk to her.",

During year 8 our friend \u201cR\u201d was bullied by this girl relentlessly making her feel like she didn\u2019t even want to come to school. Which this bullying has stop due to \u201cR\u201d not being in the same class with \u201cA\u201d the bully anymore.  Fast forward to last year, my friend \u201cC\u201d got in \u201cA\u201d class and ended up becoming friends with her due to having no one else. Once this friendship came apparent to me, I quickly informed \u201cC\u201d about \u201cA\u201d past actions which she then proceeded to say \u201cshe isn\u2019t like that to me.\u201d Brushing it off basically. Despite how messed up that is I allowed them to continue their friendship without bothering them for about a year. Within that time \u201cA\u201d also wronged \u201cC\u201d by dragging her to a fight against her will causing \u201cC\u201d to take a break from their friendship. A few days ago \u201cC\u201d sent me a photo on Snapchat of her with \u201cA\u201d to which a responded \u201cOh! A Wow!\u201d My friend ended up crashing out on me saying stuff like she doesn\u2019t care and that \u201cA\u201d was helping her through stuff and being just bluntly rude towards me but the thing is I didn\u2019t even know they were friends again? So her yelling at me was uncalled for because I was saying it in a \u201cjoking way\u201d like oh that\u2019s awkward iykyk.  In these messages she continued to yell and argue with me, causing stuff over nothing practically. At one point to which I brought up in response to this ridiculousness I tried to explain to \u201cC\u201d since I had no update that \u201cA\u201d wronged her to which again cussed me out and said \u201cA\u201d was helping her through stuff. So at this point I was so annoyed because she was being unnecessarily rude to me, I said to her regardless of \u201cA\u201d making it up to her now she has still wronged her and our friend \u201cR\u201d in the past, and overall is a bad person despite her being a good friend momentarily. Responding to this \u201cC\u201d said she helping me through stuff\u201d completely ignoring her traumatising treatment to our good friend \u201cR\u201d. So I then called her out about this again completely ignoring this girls terrible actions.  Overall at the end of the fight, she ended it by saying that she would expose me to all her friends by talking bad about me to them and that she will block me if I don\u2019t shut up because she was having a \u201cbad\u201d day. I know she\u2019s going to paint herself as the victim as she\u2019s done previously multiple times in other arguments but I don\u2019t think having a bad day can justify this ignorant friendship. So I just wanna know what you guys think, AITA?",

        "selftext": "I had a friend for years. We were great friends, if not best friends to each other. She's the type who HAS to be in a relationship otherwise she thinks she's worthless.  For perspective; she was single for a whole TWO MONTHS once and was claiming no one loves her and she was worthless, life wasn't worth living alone, etc. Going extreme with it. Of course I told her all that wasn't true. Though at the same time I had no sympathy for her because I had been single for years. It was an unintentional, I hope, slap in the face to me. Well, she also had the habit of saying Every Single New Boyfriend makes me so happy! I really found the one! No one's ever made me feel like this before!  After boyfriend number 12 or so, I noticed the pattern.  She got with a guy, stayed with him for a year or more but then, out of nowhere, dumps him and gets with a new guy. Immediately moved in with new guy.  Not her typical move. When asked about it she claimed the last relationship was done long ago, and I morned it months ago. He had his chance to make things right. I finally spoke my mind on this. That she had essentially clung to the old boyfriend because she can't tolerate being single. Instead of ending the relationship and being on her own, she selfishly clung onto him until she found someone else to latch onto. She was offended by this. Claimed I should be happy for her because she's the happiest she's ever been. This new guy has his stuff together, has a car, has his own house. Treats her right for once. I tried to get her to recognize that she has said the same thing about Every new relationship. She somehow twisted this, claiming I said she was happy with her drug addicted ex (that had been, 5 boyfriends previously, I believe) No. When she first met that guy, she said the exact same things. But she's comparing the worst of that relationship with the start of this one. Ignoring the start of the previous one. I essentially told her what she did was wrong and that I don't approve of this decision of hers. I thought it was a bad move all around and worried she would end up in an even worse situation eventually. She twisted this into me wanting her to be miserable and alone. Refusing to accept when I said otherwise. Then we cut contact and I've not heard from her since.  What does the internet decree? Was I the asshole?",

I'll admit we were super young when we had her but I was in birth control which it didn't work in my favor. I have graduated with lots of vacational schools that still haven't leanded me a job but im working part time as a teacher. My bf in the other hand have been in college for about 4 years but kept switching so he just started his planned career a semester ago. To be exact he still have 3 years until he finish his school if he doesn't switch again. My issue is I just graduated as a phlebotomist but can't get a job so I wanted to join the army. As most know if you get married it's easier with the child and get help in the long runs my bf in the other hand doesn't want to get married instead stops me from going so I don't have to fight custody so my baby gets left with my mother. To be clear I been with him for 5 years. I know I might be young but hearing the words I don't want to marry you did hurt. My issue is AITAH for fighting custody of my daughter so I can join the military? Ps he doesn't work at all so I'm financially support my daughter n I live with my parents n he lives with his. He does come every two days to see his daughter but he is in the phone most of the time and yells at my baby a lot. I know going to a legal battle for my baby's custody would mean a end to the relationship but not sure if it's worth it anymore ? Help !!",

I bring my horn to every game and blow it every time someone scores and the kids love it! Not once have either of the two moms brought their horn and I've always wondered why? About a week ago, on our group chat I asked if they weren't going to use it to bring to the next game so my younger son can use it as he loves to blow the horn when someone scores. Neither of them brought it. It's not about the money because it was only around $12-$15 (each). I feel it is rude that they havent brought it to any game this season and we are nearing the end of the season. Nor, when I asked for my son to use one if they weren't going to, they still didnt give it back.

        "selftext": "GF has had two jobs these past three years. First job was through a friend of her father and the second job, I took my lunch break to go with her to apply. I literally had to motivate her in the car before she got the courage to walk in and apply. She suffers from anxiety and just the thought of applying to jobs is anxiety inducing. I can't count the number of times I have sent her places to apply online or we are walking past a restaurant with a hiring sign and she says she wants to apply and never does. This past summer we went again to apply for restaurant jobs and she broke down crying in the car because she was so overwhelmed. On another date she eventually was able to apply to a few. I walked with her along the way and kept my distance when she went inside. Unfortunately she did not get a call back. Months ago she told me that there was a restaurant close to her school that she planned to apply to but hasn\u2019t to this day. She got into a very prestigious academic program a couple years ago. Before that however, she lied to me about applying for a different program for months and only told me when she couldn\u2019t lie anymore. Last year I met the owner of a top firm in the field my girlfriend is studying and bragged about her and asked if she could email the owner with the hopes of getting an internship. I had to craft the email for her and she sent it off. I asked her a week after if she heard anything back from the owner and she said no which I found strange. It was only months later while in casual conversation that she admitted that the owner did message her soon after her email and she missed it and she didn\u2019t want to tell me because she was embarrassed. An opportunity at my workplace came up recently. We have spoken in the past about her working there and she said yes she would be okay working there as the money and environment is good. We had not been speaking for a couple weeks due to an unrelated issue so I decided to apply for her. I created an email and crafted a cover letter and resume and applied. The manager replied offering her an interview and I sent a screenshot to her asking if she was still interested. She said yes but then accused me of \u2018violating\u2019 her by doing what I did and also wondering \u2018what I else I could send without her consent\u2019. She is framing it as creepy and alarming. I feel like if she didn\u2019t have that history, for sure you can make that case but for her to act like I did without acknowledging her anxiety and past actions is deceitful and victimizing herself unnecessarily. It really took me by surprise and did hurt because I saw it as dishonest to frame what I was doing as such a big violation when she knows there\u2019s a whole recent history of her not being able to get jobs without help and avoiding applying for jobs. She has asked me in the past to help her draft stuff for her and help in applying for jobs so her framing what I did as something completely out of left field is disappointing. AITA?--",

        "selftext": "Throw Away because I may be TA here.  The backstory is my brother-in-law (35m) lives a block away from my husband John (22m) and myself (22f). We will call the brother-in-law Billy. Billy is financially very stable. My husband John and I are not. Billy is John's half-sibling who was raised by his mother's side of the family. Billy's Mom passed away 5 years ago and left him a substantial inheritance. Billy didn't have a lot of contact with his dad's side of the family. Once his mother passed away he reached out to be closer to his dad and brother John.  John and I have known each other since 4th grade. We started dating around the 9th grade and got married last year. Billy has never liked that John and I are a couple. He feels like we should have waited to get married until we were more financially stable, finished college, and dated other people. John and I think he is projecting since he is the child of a broken home.  So Billy is constantly involving himself in our marriage. One way he does this is to stop by unannounced every day. He eats our food and tells me I am a horrible wife and a terrible woman for choosing school over being a wife and mother. He also constantly questions why we have no children yet. (Because we can barely feed ourselves and are still in school.) Anyway, you get the idea; Billy is not a nice person to us, but he is family.  The reason I may be TA is before Winter Break I was up early and desperately searching for something to eat, like I said we are starving college students. Billy knows we are struggling and does nothing to help us out, but he continues to show up for every meal. On this particular morning, I found a half jar of peanut butter and some old packages of instant oatmeal in the cabinet. Like clockwork, here comes Billy waddling in for a free meal. I was stressed, about to take my finals that day, and worried my husband and I would not have enough nourishment to get through them. So I grabbed the jar of peanut butter and dumped 2 heaping spoonfuls into the pot. Billy is allergic to peanuts and he freaks out yelling that I am trying to kill him. Now he has the whole family believing I hate him and tried to murder him on purpose. Even John is saying it would have been a rough day but it would have been easier than to deal with this backlash. AITA here? EDIT: I am adding this edit to clarify that I did not try to feed the oatmeal to Billy. I added to the pot so he couldn't have any. That probably makes me an even bigger AH. It was a moment of weakness. EDIT 2: I want to say thank you to everyone for your feedback. John and I are going to take much of the advice. This has been very hard for us and we did need to hear some of this feedback. Thank you all for helping us get over our first hurdle as a married couple. ",

It was pouring outside and I noticed I forgot my umbrella so I peaked into the room and saw that there was a class in there and left again. Then I looked at the clock and saw I would have to wait 30 minutes so I decided to quickly just grab it as to not disturb the class. So I went into the room, walking into the direction of my umbrella and the teacher was aggressively asking  what are you doing here?! (was machst du hier?!) and I said I just forgot my umbrella and proceeded to get it and walked back into the direction of the door. While walking back he was aggressively saying something like du bist unm\u00f6glich!! You are impossible!! (idk if thats right, maybe you already guessed i'm not pretty good at english x3) and that caused me to feel personally attacked, so my fight or flight (kind of more like fight AND flight at this point) I talked back like you are just as impossible and idk what he said then but he kept on looking down on me so much, like I wasnt a human. I pulled myself together and answered yeah yeah instead of starting a fight) and slammed the door shut. I usually dont get aggressive with anyone but this guy just triggered me so much with how he was acting like he is the most important ever and how dare I disturb his lesson. He probably expected me to knock and be like Sorry to disturb your class, I forgot my umbrella and wait for his permission to get it, when this would interrupt the class way more than just grabbing it. And also he was the one making all of this into a scene by being angry at me in the first place.. a normal person could have just said nothing or if they are really bothered sth like knock next time but no.. like ok I wasnt really the most polite either and shouldnt have talked back so probably I am the asshole and should be kicked from school for this right?

        "selftext": "So, this happened awhile back and me and friend recently brought this back up. Basically, me and my friends had been planning to go out to lunch during one of the weekends and we had been planning this for about two weeks. When the day rolls around, I ended having to be taken there by my grandma and at the time, my cousin was with my grandma also. I was running a bit late but while we\u2019re riding in the car, my grandma brings up that I\u2019m going out to eat and decides to ask me if my cousin can come, I ended up saying sure and gave my friends a heads up that my cousin was coming although there was a bit a protest from them, there was nothing I could do because I didn\u2019t wanna tell her no and my cousin doesn\u2019t really have a lot of friends and we have always bit sort of close. So we get to the restaurant and things go as they should, my cousin doesn\u2019t really talk to anyone besides me and isn\u2019t bothering anyone, she just eats and pays for her own food as everyone does. Today my friend text me telling me that he thought it was really weird that I invited my cousin to a gathering that was for friends and something we had been planning for a while. I blew this off because I didn\u2019t see it as that big a deal but he told me he was serious and asked why I would invite her, I told him that there was no harm in it and that she minded her own business the entire time. He protested and told me that wasn\u2019t the point and it was mainly the fact that I invited her without consulting anyone else and as I said before we were literally in the car on the way to the restaurant when \u201cI invited\u201d her. He then thought it would be good to say \u201cns idk why ur gma even let her go she knew it was like a friend thing\u201d and to me this sounded so stupid because my grandma obviously didn\u2019t see any harm in inviting her and was only trying to help my cousin out. Of course I understand where he\u2019s coming from but she literally sat there and did nothing but eat and talk to me and he\u2019s complaining now? Mind you this happened months ago. (I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m really bad and story telling and writing)",

        "selftext": "Hello,I got married last year. Before we got married, during our dating phase, we've always had issues. We broke up a couple of times and came back together because I refused to let go and held on to him.Anyways, the last time we came back together before he proposed, I kind of pushed for it but it seemed like he felt what he had been doing was wrong and he said he was willing to change. Fast forward to getting married and living together, I contribute financially to the household. We both do. I do the cooking and the cleaning. He helps out with cleaning when he can. Sometimes when I clean he feels it's not up to his standard and starts cleaning again. Fair enough. A couple of days ago, the laundry was full and he put it in the washer and then asked why I didn't, then I said I was going to do it later. He then said, why didn't I do it then. I didn't say anything. We went to bed without speaking and on my way to work the next day, he called me after v texted during the night that I didn't th.. it's fair that he makes it out as if I don't do anything in the house. I then went on to say, I'm the one washing the toilets, doing the vacuum and although he puts the clothes in the washer, I have to pop them in the dryer and always did that and fold them back into the closet. He then went on to say it's not that I don't do them but I do them on my own time. But whose time would I do them on? I'm working. I do the chores on my off days cause I know that's when I'm free to cook and do cleaning.Then I said he should not help again then if he is going to keep complaining about the fact that he helps in the house and I told him to fuck off. Yeah maybe I was wrong for telling him to get off the phone but I think it's unfair to tell me to do the chores on his own time considering we both work. Even after night shift sometimes, I do the house chores",

That\u2019s not really in dispute here but the issue is that I was out of contact with my family for those 3 days and they were very worried. I spun a story about losing my phone. The whole thing really messed up my life and I decided not to go back to college and to instead return home and find an alternate university to peruse my education. A few days ago a letter came to my parents house form the court about my case\u2019s disposition (I stupidly put their address down) and they found out everything that had happened and that I was in jail. They were very upset with me as was my sister that I didn\u2019t tell anyone. I\u2019d like to know I was the asshole for not telling my family I was arrested?

My cars older than i am, i\u2019m currently unemployed, i still live at home, i don\u2019t ever plan on having kids, and i\u2019m very depressed but she recently said she was done asking and is going to \u201cmatch my energy\u201d. but if i barely have the energy to keep myself going day to day how am i supposed to give her any ? especially considering her kids are only 2 and newborn it feels so overwhelming. I have very specific reasons for not wanting kids that makes me struggle to connect with them even if they\u2019re family. i even struggle to connect with my sister sometimes because we don\u2019t have any similar interests. its hard to make conversation and it feels awkward and it shouldn\u2019t be that way around family. this is NOT a political discussion but we do have wildly different opinions as well. i\u2019m the younger sibling and i just don\u2019t see how it\u2019s my responsibility drive there when she also moved 20 minutes away. This isn\u2019t really important but she also asks me last minute a lot so I have to say no because i haven\u2019t done anything productive that day. I still love my sister more than anything but i just wish she could see how things are from my side. i\u2019m really hurt that she resorted to just cutting me off without even thinking that i might be going through something. as i slightly mentioned I\u2019ve been open with her about my struggles and how I don\u2019t mean to be distant i\u2019m just constantly being set back in life this might lean you closer to i\u2019m the asshole but i also don\u2019t have plans to try and fix it. i\u2019m not saying i want it to be like this forever but i know it\u2019ll be hard for her to forgive me (if she does) i don\u2019t believe anyone is \u201cright\u201d in this situation but i do think i\u2019m not entirely at fault here.",

Antoine wasn\u2019t just another classmate\u2014he was more like a random guy I went to school with, someone I somehow got lucky enough to get close to. Rae, on the other hand, quickly became one of my closest friends. As the weeks went by, I started catching feelings for Antoine. Rae knew I liked him because I told her. What I didn\u2019t know was that Antoine had liked Rae since before the school year started. Rae said she wasn\u2019t interested, but in November, that changed. She started pulling away from me and getting closer to him. It hurt to see, so I begged her not to do anything with him\u2014not until I could get over my feelings. Rae promised she wouldn\u2019t, and I trusted her. But after Antoine got his phone back during a trip, I found out Rae had been calling him and having intimate conversations. I was devastated. I begged her to stop, and she promised it wouldn\u2019t happen again. For a while, I thought things were fine. But right before Christmas, I found out Rae had given Antoine a blow job\u2014and that they started dating that same day. I was crushed. I wanted them to break up, and the next day, they did\u2014because of me. Rae said she ended it for my sake, but it just made things messier. After the breakup, Rae admitted she never actually loved Antoine, which made me feel worse. Antoine was already going through a lot, and knowing Rae didn\u2019t truly care for him hurt me even more. Things between the two of them haven\u2019t been the same since, though I feel like I\u2019ve been getting closer to Antoine. As for Rae, I\u2019m still upset. She broke my trust twice, and when she said she didn\u2019t regret it, it cut even deeper. I want to forgive her someday, but I don\u2019t know how to let go of the pain she caused me. Am I wrong for not being able to move on? Should I try harder to forgive Rae, or is it okay to walk away when trust is broken?",

When her grandma died I asked if she wanted to talk about it and then she said no. That night the first thing that triggered my almost breakdown happened. For some context, what happened to me doesn\u2019t seem like a big deal to people outside of my family due to other issues I have. I know bsf can shut down emotionally when something goes wrong and I just wanted to talk to her about it. I sent her a video of what was going on because I miss her and I felt like I was drowning. Then Friday I sent her a snap joking that I really hate myself this week cause I\u2019m restarting a paper. She then posted on her story how she didn\u2019t want to hear about other peoples weeks cause she was just pissed off cause her grandma died. Understandable and I feel really guilty cause I felt like I wasn\u2019t thinking about that. So I sent her a message saying I was really sorry and I just needed to talk to someone about what was going on with me, and I wasn\u2019t thinking about her feelings and we both apologized for the past week She\u2019s now leaving me open on snap which is not something we do and I\u2019m worried I did something wrong cause even though I\u2019m away from having that full on breakdown I\u2019m still mentally fragile right now and I\u2019m anxious about everything.

        "selftext": "AITA for telling my girlfriend my friend said she was ugly? I\u2019ll be as honest as I can because i genuinely want to know what people think or if we\u2019re just overreacting. Keep in mind everyone in this story is 17-18. I was at a party with my friend, and he made a remark that my girlfriend was ugly. He was just like \u201cwell she\u2019s ugly anyways\u201d. He says things like this a lot and dismisses them as jokes. I can\u2019t remember too much from the party since I was a little drunk but from what I can remember she was brought up and he said it. We weren\u2019t even talking about her negatively or positively she just happened to be part of the conversation. Anyways, when I\u2019m home I\u2019m on call with her and I tell her he was saying stuff which kind of pissed me off and I was a bit stressed. She asked what and I told her what he said. Admittedly I do kind of regret telling her since if one of her friends called me ugly I probably wouldn\u2019t be too happy and this could have saved a lot of drama. But she was very much not happy with him. She\u2019d told lots of her friends about the situation and one of which is friends with my friend.  Now the next day at work me and my friend were talking and my girlfriend came up, and I told him that she really didn\u2019t like him anymore. This led to him finding out I told her. I can\u2019t even really describe his reaction. It was like angry and confused and bewildered. He told me I shouldn\u2019t have told her that and that I\u2019m useless and she\u2019s being too oversensitive and that he only said it as a joke. To add to that last part he said he\u2019s always thought she\u2019s good for me and good looking. But I don\u2019t know why he\u2019d just say she\u2019s ugly. It isn\u2019t even funny. No one even laughed at it. Like why would you joke about that.  That last part is important because like I said earlier he says lots of stuff as a \u201cjoke\u201d and never knows when he\u2019s crossed a line. And since one of his friends is friends with my girlfriend too, they\u2019ve been talking about it and he\u2019s lost a friend because their mutual friend sided with her. So he isn\u2019t too happy with me. He says he\u2019s mad at me because I told her and he\u2019s mad at my girlfriend for being too sensitive.  Finally today we had a talk about it and I told him that she has every right to be upset and he really shouldn\u2019t joke about this stuff because it isn\u2019t funny and just degrading towards her. He never actually apologised.  I do feel a bit awful because I caused quite a bit of drama, we didn\u2019t have a big argument at work but it was quite a heated conversation and now there\u2019s rumours going round saying we\u2019ve had some massive argument. I feel like in some way we\u2019re both in the wrong.  And by the way, obviously my girlfriend is not ugly. This isn\u2019t even just my opinion it\u2019s fact. I\u2019m very proud to say in the time I\u2019ve been dating her I\u2019ve never heard a single bad remark about her other than this.  TLDR: I told my girlfriend my friend said she was ugly, he found out and was mad about that. ",

        "selftext": "So it goes like this: my sister is getting married in five months. Her fianc\u00e9 doesn\u2019t have enough friends to fill out his grooms party. Instead of approaching me directly, he just showed up at my house a couple times that I wasn\u2019t available. My dad told me on accident that the reason is he wants me to be part of one of his groomsmen. This kind of pissed me off because he could have called me, texted me, something to let me know he was stopping by. I hate when people show up unannounced. I work at night and sleep in the day.Not only that, but they\u2019ve been dating for like two or three years, and I barely know the guy. He hasn\u2019t really done anything to try to build a friendship with me. He sits at home and plays RuneScape all the time. Isn\u2019t his groom party supposed to be the man in his life that he can depend on to back him up during his marriage? Is it not a massive red flag that he doesn\u2019t have any fucking friends and is a total social loser? Why should I have to plug in because he can\u2019t get off the computer and go make some? Don\u2019t get me wrong, he\u2019s done a lot of good for my sister, and he\u2019s good with things like using tools.. but am I wrong in that if he wants me to be one of his groomsmen that the reason should be because we have a bond, not just because he doesn\u2019t have enough friends to fill the spot? Should it not be a big red flag to everyone that this guy doesn\u2019t have friends..? I\u2019d rather not have more responsibilities during this familial obligation. She already wanted me to take photos. How am I supposed to do that if I\u2019m part of the party?  She is my older sister, but her fianc\u00e9 is younger than me. Maybe I should be the one to initiate some time for us to hang out? But to be honest, I don\u2019t care. I\u2019m single, have my own busy life, and feel like if this guy wants me to be close to him, he needs to man up and reach out to me. Tonight I get a text message that says to give him a call when I can. I barely know this guy. I really don\u2019t wanna do it, but I also want my sister to be happy. My family all know I\u2019m outspoken and opinionated. I\u2019m not a fan and his approach to asking me is just making it worse. UPDATE: Okay MIATA.. Spoke to my sister.. he doesn\u2019t have friends and this is her idea. I don\u2019t have to take a lot of photos because they have someone doing basic photos included. I\u2019ll do it, but i\u2019m going to invite him out to get a drink or something first so that a bachelor\u2019s party isn\u2019t the first time hanging out.

        "selftext": "So I have been with my partner for many years and during the start of our relationship I found out he is related to a new friend of mines from university as we were on the same course. I also found out his family and her family were not close anymore due to a family argument a few years back. Since I have been friends with my friend I haven\u2019t been able to talk to her ever about my partner or his family etc given she may go and tell her family. This over the years put a strain on my side of the friendship as I could never share things openly with my friends (we are a trio) and always had to hide stuff even things that may have been upsetting me in the worry that she may go and tell her family or mum. She is very close to her mum and shares many things with her, she also does have a loud mouth in general so I was always cautious of what I was or wasn\u2019t saying.  Fast forward to today, me and my partner live with his parents who are my in laws now. Due to the home we may not be able to stay long term due to wanting to start our own family and space etc. we discussed that we would maybe move out later if we had to but he would speak to his parents to kind of give them a heads up in the next few months.  I have been speaking to my friends in general about my situation and didn\u2019t explicitly say we are definitely moving but said it is something we are considering and thinking about due to family planning and we may have to do it.  I was talking to my friends and my husband leaned over and saw my friend casually showing me a home on sale because it is something we have talked about here and there as the time is slowly approaching for family planning and also house buying is a long process.  My husband then got upset at me saying why did I tell my friends and I said why not. He then said what if she (his relative) goes and tells her family and they tell his family (parents) before we have even told them. I got mad and said why can I not talk to my friends I never said we are definitely going but that we are considering. He continued to then say if something does come out we will deal with it at that time. He then said you won\u2019t be friends with her (background: I agreed should she cause any harm in our marriage then I would stop talking to her) . I got mad and started saying you can\u2019t tell me not to be friend with her etc, unless you\u2019re telling me this is something you\u2019re going to divorce me over. He then said how is it going to look if they find out from someone else or that we didn\u2019t tell them ourself.  I then said something along the lines you\u2019re just saying this because your upset your parents are going to cry some tears if they found out. Which he then got really upset about with me and told me I have upset him. I didn\u2019t respond after that and the conversation of the topic ended.  AITA for saying this to my husband as I feel like I am justified in saying this as I don\u2019t think it is that deep if my friend did tell her family and his parents found out earlier because we haven\u2019t made any moves to actually move, look actively for homes or even 100% know that we are going. We are also in a position where we likely will have to leave due to space capacity so it is an obvious thing I am sure they are thinking of or aware of ",

For a while now she\u2019s been living off her kids and bullying my gf and today I had enough of the stupid shit. Me and her brother went to the lake today to kick it and talk. While there he smokes his weed. I don\u2019t smoke so I didn\u2019t hit the blunt. When getting back to the house I make sure I spray well. (Note he didn\u2019t spray at all.)  As we come in she says \u201c I better not smell shit.\u201d She comes out the bathroom and starts cusssing at me saying \u201c I\u2019m sick of that fucking smell this ain\u2019t no fucking weed house tf are you doing . ( note my gfs mom didn\u2019t apologize for shit and never thinks she\u2019s wrong.\u201d) I don\u2019t say anything and I go upstairs . SHE COMES ALL THE WAY FROM DOWNSTAIRS  banging on my gfs dooor saying it smells like weed and I\u2019m so sick of this shit cussing at me and my gf. ( note again, she lives with her 7 kids and they all split EVERY SINGLE BILL TOGETHER  that  still includes rent which is 680$ per person. ATP your kids aren\u2019t living with you yall are roommates. She goes on to say I don\u2019t say anything bc yall (gf and her brothers and sisters) pay bills and I say \u201cwell it doesn\u2019t feel like it I feel like it\u2019s fair game if everyone split bills evenly ( she drinks beer like it\u2019s fucking water. I truly think she\u2019s an alcoholic.) she then starts cussing at me and I start cussing back saying who tf are you talking to get tf out my face with that stupid shit basically telling her about her self. Apart me feels like I overreacted but also another part of me is like \u201c you don\u2019t let nobody disrespect you.\u201d So am I the asshole ?  Edit: Also her friends smoke weed religiously. When they come inside they literally smell like a TREE. They even roll up in the house in front of the kids when they get done smoking you can literally smell it upstairs. They don\u2019t spray or anything . Gfs mom never says anything to them about their smell",

        "selftext": "I, a 24 yo female, have been engaged to my husband for around a year now. We have a seemingly perfect relationship. We split bills properly, care for eachother, and have a good intimate life. This all started around a couple weeks ago, and I am still trying to process this situation and figure out if I am in the wrong or not.  A couple weeks prior to this taking place, me and my fianc\u00e9e were moving my things into his apartment, since it's a more spacious place, and ironically, it's closer to my workplace than my old apartment. Now here's where the trouble begins.  I am a cleanfreak. I need everything to be clean and orderly no matter where I am. That is just how I was raised because my mother has the same tendencies. We were cleaning out his room to make space for the new bed we bought, along with my other necessities I brought along with me. As we were moving out his old twin size bed, I found a tupperware container underneath the bed. It wasn't marked, nor did he tell me what it was. I assumed it was old food left under his bed since the container was foggy, so I marched to the kitchen to throw it out. Later that night, he began frantically looking for something. When I asked what he was looking for, he said he was looking for his moms ashes. I offered to help because that's what any normal person would do, and that's when the search began. I asked him what the urn looked like that he kept her in, and what he said next made my stomach drop. He said she was in a tupperware container due to the fact that he still couldn't come to terms with her passing (this was two years ago that she passed).  I turned pale, and when I told him I threw them away, he lost his mind. The story could've ended there having found them, but the only problem was, the garbage truck had already came to pick up the garbage we threw away.  Long story short, after a big argument, I am staying at my moms and my fianc\u00e9e has ceased all contact with me for the time being. I feel horrinle, but also, who keeps their moms ashes in a tupperware container?! Am I The Asshole? ",

        "selftext": "I (37F) was flying out of state for work. My flight landed late, during my boarding time for my next flight. I tried to get up quick and shoot out ahead of people but had a guy stand up and block me very purposefully saying he also had a flight, then proceeded to stand there and willingly let the isle fill up to let everyone in front of him go ahead even though half the isle was empty in front of him at the beginning. He didn\u2019t even move to grab his stuff. I stayed quiet. I was unhappy and frustrated but didn\u2019t say anything. Didn\u2019t even glare. I frowned, cause that was a dick move. But I just bounced anxiously hoping things went quick.  Another passenger sitting in a row near me got my attention and said, \u201chey, we\u2019re all late for our connecting flights so maybe be respectful.\u201d  \u2026. \ud83d\ude21I frowned and took a breath. I looked at him and said very politely, \u201cI am being respectful. I\u2019m not yelling or cursing or asking people to move. I\u2019m not screaming or whining that I\u2019m gonna miss my flight. Nor am I giving anyone dirty looks. I\u2019m standing here being as patient as possible because I understand that.\u201d  Which believe me was a feat considering I had barely just taken my anxiety pills for the day, not that they needed to know that. \ud83d\ude12 It felt like I was being chastised by a stranger for being anxious and showing a modicum of emotion. I was quiet, obviously annoyed but not directing it towards anyone or anything. I don\u2019t think I was being disrespectful. Yes I was trying to jump ahead because my next flight was supposed to be boarding. Was it rude to try and get off before others who had time between their flights? Was it disrespectful simply because I was the last row in the plane and should wait seated for everyone else to off board and potentially miss my flight because others weren\u2019t moving without a sense of urgency? Or was it the emotional distress I was showing that was disrespectful part? AITA?  If so I humbly accept the title, but if I am, why so I can understand. If I should wait patiently in my seat I can do that.  EDIT: I will accept that I am the AH. Thank you. I will stay seated next time and let the flight attendants know about my tight connecting flight. I really didn\u2019t know I could/should do that. I do know I was not the only person with connecting flights that may be tight and I should have realized that. I will do better next time thank you.",

        "selftext": "Ok, so. First of all, I\u2019ve never posted before and I\u2019m doing this on mobile so please forgive any mistakes that pop up. I\u2019ll triple check the post before posting but you never know with these things. For safety reasons I\u2019m also going to change any names so that no one can guess as to who I may be talking about. I just really want to get some insight into what happened recently with a friend of mine, and see if I\u2019m really in the wrong here. But I (28NB) recently moved across the country for the first time in my life. I quit my \u201ccareer\u201d job, packed all of my belongings up, and shoved as much as I could in my car and drove over 800 miles to a new destination I had only visited for a week a few months prior (and fell in love with). I was living with my parents (technically my Great Aunt (72F) and Uncle(74M), but for this we\u2019ll just say my parents) and looking for a place to move out to anyways, and it was time for a change in scenery.  Anyways, the only thing I wasn\u2019t able to grab before I left for this life changing trip was my medication. I\u2019m very fortunate that I don\u2019t have to take anything SUPER serious (no controlled substances), but the meds I DO take tend to have serious side effects if you just stop taking them. Well, since I quit my job, my insurance stopped at some point. Also, of course, my last batch of meds were ready the day after I packed up my car and drove halfway across the states. Before that point, I asked my friend - we\u2019ll call her Janet(30F) - to pick up my them up for me if she could and send them my way.  She did, and then proceeded to hold onto them for a month and a half. In fact, I was under the impression she picked up ALL of my meds - because I had put in an order for all of my meds - but she didn\u2019t even check to let me know. I had to constantly text and remind her to send them my way because I was slowly running out of my medication and getting closer and closer to having to start withdrawing from them\u2026which I never want to do without the help of a PCP or psych by my side (which I didn\u2019t have at the moment because I JUST moved to a new area and lost my insurance). By the end of the month and a half, I had to get another friend to send them for me (who did it immediately without any trouble).  Something I didn\u2019t realize is that technically sending medication in the mail is frowned upon, according to google, at least. And as Janet so kindly reminded me, after a month and a half, she worked at UPS and let me know that they had constant drug dogs checking packages and scanners for the boxes to run through. But my boyfriend told me he had his meds shipped by his mom for years before across state lines without issues, and another friend of ours\u2019 dad actually worked at USPS and he himself would ship out their meds pretty regularly for years as well. So if Janet just didn\u2019t put a return address and didn\u2019t mention what was being shipped, what was the big issue?  Am I going crazy? Am I the asshole here? Am I just a doormat?",

        "selftext": " I made plans with my wife and two friends to have them over for dinner and games on Saturday. Basically it was a double date. I bought new controllers and the newest version of Mario Party so we could all play together. In the morning I cooked and prepped a meal to serve the four of us and left it in the crock pot to cook for 7 hours. Then my wife and I left to visit my nephew who had just made it out of the ICU. I had given my friends a time frame between 5-9pm to come over. We ended up staying at the hospital until 5. The friends (which are a couple) called to let us know they were there at 5. They didn't let us know they were on the way over so we couldnt intercept them and let them know we weren't home yet. My wife told them we would be back in a half hour. They have the code to our home so they could have gone in and sat to wait, but I think they just sat in the driveway for almost an hour. The traffic coming back was horrible. They texted us at 5:45 and said we left. Going on a date instead. And then did not respond to us after that. They're obviously pissed that we were late and maybe feel like their time was disrespected. I told them I was sorry I didn't communicate that we were out and that I wished they could have tried the food at least. My wife offered for them to come back after their date to eat with us but they declined.  I feel like we were both in the wrong here by not communicating our locations. I understand we were late to our own party, but that's why I gave the wide range of 5-9pm. I'm just waiting now to let them cool off and see if they eventually respond to my apology. I felt really dissapointed/sad that I had all this food and my fun night with friends was cancelled, and I'm sure they felt bored and annoyed as they waited.  ********Update********I called both of them individually and told them I was sorry for disrespecting their time. They were both understanding and forgiving. I lost track of time when I was at the hospital because my nephew was starting to walk and talk again after a near death illness. I should have texted them while I was there but didn't realize until it was too late. Neither did my wife. I felt defensive and disappointed that they did their own thing and hoped they would have texted before coming over. I told them a time and they came during that time so they are at no fault here.

        "selftext": "I (35M) have a friend, Steve (48), who accidentally got Stephanie (44) pregnant about a decade ago, and they now have a daughter, Chloe (9). I met Steve last year at a park while walking my dog, and we became friends since he lives nearby and also has a dog. Steve\u2019s a good guy who cares deeply about his daughters (he has three adult daughters from another relationship). Whenever I\u2019m with Steve and Stephanie calls, she often seems ridiculous. Sometimes she calls over minor things; other times, she\u2019s frantic, like she\u2019s on the verge of a breakdown. She\u2019s a helicopter parent and very possessive of Chloe. Stephanie doesn\u2019t let Chloe visit Steve alone. The first time Steve ever took Chloe anywhere without her was recently\u2014and only because one of his adult daughters went with them to a movie. Steve said Stephanie blew up Chloe's phone the entire time. Steve wanted to teach Chloe to ski, but Stephanie told him it wasn\u2019t appropriate for a 9-year-old and that he needed to find a better activity. Every idea Steve has for activities gets shut down with an excuse. Despite this, Stephanie often makes passive-aggressive comments like, \u201cCome over here and be a dad,\u201d even though Steve gives her at least $250 a month (voluntarily, no court order) and spends multiple evenings a week at her place to be with Chloe as that's Stephanie's idea of visitation. She makes it seem like he isn't a good father or something when it is\u00a0**she**\u00a0that doesn't really let Chloe hang out with friends,\u00a0**she**\u00a0that bought Chloe a smartphone due to her incessant need to always be able to contact her,\u00a0**she**\u00a0who isolates Chloe from Steve's side of the family and\u00a0**she**\u00a0who is always worrying about making rent, yet only has a part-time job and spends money that should be going towards other things on weed. When Steve brought up to Stephanie that he thought that 9 is way too young to have a smartphone, his concerns were all ignored. When he brought up that he doesn't like Chloe being around her when she is smoking weed due to secondhand smoke, the issue was disregarded. Recently, Stephanie moved, and I helped Steve while she mostly stood around watching. Her place looked like it was recently featured on *Hoarders*. That day, Stephanie took Chloe to the ER for **the flu** as Urgentcare won't see her without insurance. Later, I told Steve about the Affordable Care Act and how he could get insurance for himself and Chloe. The next day, Steve asked Stephanie for Chloe\u2019s social security number to enroll her, and Stephanie freaked out, saying, I don't even give Chloe's SSN to the state! She claimed Chloe was already insured and when asked by Steve who the insurer was, she mumbled something vague. I directly asked, \u201cWho is she insured through then?\u201d and Stephanie snapped, yelling, \u201cWE ARE HER PARENTS!\u201d When we left, Steve said, \u201cSee what I\u2019m dealing with? How she snapped at you?\u201d I replied that she had a point\u2014it\u2019s not really my business. What do you think? Was I an asshole for asking who insures her child? EDIT: I wanted to add that I have already advised him to get an attorney. He mentioned once that his brother is in huge debt over attorney fees to get time with his own daughter. I let him know that many attorneys will work with you and let you pay in monthly installments and he was very receptive. I was going to include that in the original post but was limited to 3000 characters. Why he hasn't done this already? I don't know, I mean I certainly would have long ago. Also that about $250 is in addition to him paying a big portion of her rent every month. SECOND EDIT: Wanted to add that I agree that my buddy should have taken care of this sooner. He stopped smoking weed shortly after I met him and has gotten and new job and is getting his life together, but Stephanie has made not made it easy for him to be a good dad by alienating Chloe from him and his side of the family. Her need for control is so great that she won't allow Steve to spend time with the child alone, and she wouldn't give the SSN to Steve because she perceives it as getting one over on her. When Steve asked her for the SSN so he could insure Chloe at **no cost to her** she should be happy to oblige, not adversarial. She isn't working at co-parenting and **he clearly is.** As far as child support what more should he be doing? He already pays a big portion of the rent and whenever she calls him for money, he never says no or doesn't give her money when she asks so I'm not sure what more he should be doing. ",

        "selftext": "So i(18f) have some friends, the ones related to the conflict are: \u201cAiden\u201d, \u201dAbby\u201d and \u201cJane\u201d. The ones that aren\u2019t directly in the conflict but need a name are: \u201cRose\u201d, and \u201cDan\u201d. (All are assorted 18f or 18m). More relevant context: Aiden and Abby are dating and tend to share the same brain cell as wells fan the others flames (in the sense of causing them to be more angry) So last week I was making brownies for myself. I never bake so I decided to send a picture of the brownies to my group chat with a bunch of my friends. Abby responded with \u201cmmm I really wish I had brownies\u201d. I\u2019m a sarcastic person so I\u2019m response I said \u201cwhy do you think I made them\u201d. Dan answered my question like it was literal, so i explained that I was being sarcastic and I meant it as \u201cI\u2019m making the brownies because I was brownies too\u201d. So Aiden then messages being like \u201cwell are you going to mail her some?\u201d(I\u2019m currently on the other side of the country) And I said \u201cnah, she can bake her own brownies\u201dI didn\u2019t feel like it was too much to ask because brownies are pretty easy to make. All of a sudden Aiden was saying that I was being harsh, then Abby joined in saying that I was being rude. I tried to explain that I just felt like brownies weren\u2019t that hard to make, and I said that if Aiden wanted her to have brownies so bad then he could make them for her. They got more upset with me for that. Then Abby sends me a message saying that she didn\u2019t appreciate how I was treating her Aiden or Dan.Aiden chimes in saying it\u2019s rude to bake something and not at least say \u201ci would offer you some if you were here\u201d At this point I felt like it was inappropriate to address this in the group chat with what I thought was 5 people that had nothing to do with this. So I chose to not answer the messages and hoped they would message me privately to figure it out. Rose calls me later and tells me that despite saying nothing to me Jane is also upset. She was telling me that they were talking shit about me in a group chat I\u2019m not in.The thing that made me the most upset was that they were saying things like \u201csomeone call her so she can\u2019t escape it.\u201d, \u201cShe\u2019s being such an asshole\u201d, \u201cher boyfriend is influencing her.\u201d. Obviously it hurt to see this side of my friends. I deleted social media and ignored all their messages. Am I the asshole for this situation? Update: A bit after I posted this I did try to speak with them, however it didn\u2019t go great and they didn\u2019t like or listen to what I had to say. it essentially dragged out more of the situation with \u201cDan\u201d to which I countered that how I treat him he\u2019s fine with (him and I act like siblings in the way of like making jabs at each other) and that if he isn\u2019t fine with it he lets me know. I\u2019m still annoyed that they might\u2019ve thrown away our friendship over brownies. Dan, Rose and 2 others from the group are all still on good terms and are somewhat trying to help defuse the situation and all admit it\u2019s stupid. So this is snowballing and I\u2019m just gonna ignore them for a while :)",

I am very excited/stressed to watch my team play at 3:00. They care nothing about sports and will most likely make me feel like a lunatic cheering on my team. I know they think sports are silly. I just don't think i can feel/exhibit my real emotions about the game if they are there. Also, they are our neighbors, so I told my husband I'd love to have them for lunch, but I'd rather not have anyone over during the game. AITA? Edited to Add: I never invited them. My husband thought it would be more fun if we had them over at the same time as the game. He invited them without asking me.  Living so far from my side of the family always makes me homesick on game day. Watching it with people who think sports are dumb makes it even harder. Still, I hear you all and have told them to stay for the whole game, and who knows maybe we'll all have more fun than we expected.  Edited: They bought in hard. Great Game. Great company.

My (31F) bf (34M) arrogantly ordered Indian food from uber eats when I told him not to, that if he just waits a bit my dad's friend who owns a very highly rated Indian joint can get us food when it opens tomorrow, and that the place he's ordering from isn't good, but he didn't wait. Just stubbornly goes I'm just gonna get this shrugging his shoulders without even looking at me.  Well he goes to bed early after eating it and I had some work to catch up on, so join him a bit later. As soon as I lift the sheets up to get into bed, it STINKS. He's been farting up the entire bed, and now filling the room with gas. I'm so annoyed. I try going to bed, but he just keeps farting and each one stinks. Opening the window doesn't help. Of course I'm having a go at him because I have to get up for work tomorrow (he doesn't have work until noon) and so he moves to the couch in defiance.  Some context: it's the middle of winter, it's super cold in the living room couch, and he doesn't have enough blankets. It's also my place he's sleeping over at, and we drove over in my car, which I need to get to work. By now it's 1am and I figure it will take half an hour to drop him home, I can be back by 1:45am and at least get a few hours of decent sleep..... AND... so would he!\u00a0  I tell him I'm taking him home and basically kicking him out, but I'll drive him home and drive back.... Now he's EVEN MORE upset now, but agreeing. We are arguing the whole way.\u00a0  The next day I told my parents and they said I kicked him out of my house and that was wrong. Reddit, AITA?",

I didn\u2019t say anything in front of the kids but when home I checked he\u2019d used the joint account, and when he confirmed he had I asked why he\u2019d not corrected the kids that it wasn\u2019t just him that had paid.  He went off at me for ruining a good night and that I was being picky about paying the bill, completely missing my point.  My point wasn\u2019t about money, it was about him taking the credit and not correcting the kids.

        "selftext": "Sorry if this is long, trying to paint the full picture here. My ex (33F) and I (32M) have a son (8M) together. Other than the odd disagreement we have coparented very well for quite a few years now. We have an agreement in place but it\u2019s flexible. We sit together at his sports, I go over there to play with him when it\u2019s not my designated time, we do holidays together, you get the idea. My son plays hockey and it\u2019s become his whole identity, it\u2019s all he wants to do ever. I grew up playing hockey and his mom is not sporty in the slightest, so it\u2019s something that him and I bond over and he is always asking for me to play with him. Thursday night after his practice he asked both his mom and I if I could come play with him in the basement after his game today (he has a set up in his basement at his moms with a full sized net and sheets of fake ice). We both have the okay and all was good. At the game today I told her that the outdoor rinks were finally good quality and ready (we are Canadian eh) so I was going to take him out to do that instead. She was fine with it, and he looked like a kid at Christmas when I told him. After his game we went straight there and played for 2 hours. He then told me he was hungry (after playing hockey for 3 hours straight no doubt). Important to note that this kid gives no warning, he goes from fine to starving in 3.2 seconds and has an utter meltdown like he hasn\u2019t eaten in 6 years every time. It\u2019s a known thing and a running joke between all friends and family. We were much closer to my place and I had not been given a time to have him home or mention of plans so we went back to my place to I could make him dinner quick before I took him back to his mom. I got a text from her as we were eating, she was planning on ordering them pizza and wanted to know how much longer we would be. When I told her we were eating already and I would drop him off soon she got extremely snippy with me, essentially telling me that I was stealing her time and that if I did that to her I would be pissed, it went on and on especially because I honestly can\u2019t figure out what the issue was. Should I have checked in and seen if she had plans? Maybe. Should she have said she had dinner plans for them? Also maybe. But she told me it wasn\u2019t about the food, it was about \u2018me stealing time from her\u2019. From the time we left his game to the time I dropped him off, fed, was less than 3 hours. Am I really the asshole here?",

        "selftext": "I\u2019m friends with an elderly woman who has no kids and no family here.  She does have a male friend (boyfriend or something to that nature) that helps her with rides and shopping, but doesn\u2019t live with her.  We talk sporadically, once or twice every two weeks.  I\u2019ve tried to help her with shopping or taking her to appointments but she refuses.  She has had ongoing heart and diabetic issues for a year and a half now.  In the beginning when she was getting a procedure done for heart she wouldn\u2019t let me take her or stay with her.   But I went anyways and stayed with her. She appreciated this but she always tells me her male friend will take her or she won\u2019t tell me about the actual time or day of the appointment.  She does not accept anything from me or other people, besides her male friend.   Our relationship is this:  I call and she calls and we go out once in a while for lunch, where she refuses to allow me to pay.  Every time I give her something she will return it and not accept it at all.  It\u2019s difficult to be a friend with her since she will be offended if you don\u2019t accept her gifts\u2026really deeply offended.  On the flip side she will not take anything from you at all.  I tried so many times, cookies for holidays, clothes, pay for lunch etc etc.  It\u2019s extremely frustrating.  She will actually save what I give her and return it to me the next time she sees me.  Recently she left me a message saying she had an MRI done and it was scary and something else I couldn\u2019t hear and she ended the call saying congratulations on you new job (I recently got laid off and I\u2019ve been looking for a job and I left her a message saying I found a job).   I honestly didn\u2019t think she was looking for a call back so I took that message as info and moved on.  Four days later I called her back, she didn\u2019t answer and I left a message asking how she is doing and that I miss her and love her and asked if she is out shopping with her male friend.  Cheery message and nothing else.  I didn\u2019t hear back so I called her today and she picked up the phone and literally cussed me out saying I am a bad friend and how I always say I\u2019ll be there for her but when she called to tell me about her mri I waited 4 days to call her and that her male friend agrees that I did a bad thing and she shouldn\u2019t be expecting anything from me since I don\u2019t care.  She also threw in that she does so much for me and this is how I behave.  I am in shock right now.  She has a lot of health issues and goes to the hospital for numerous procedures.  I know she wouldn\u2019t want me to take her or do anything but am I a bad friend for this incident.  I am feeling extremely sad and shocked and the fact that her male friend is agreeing with her is making me feel like a big AH. Am I?",

What was fun was that it's no receipts and cash only jobs so it's under the table and no taxes on that money!  Now she's got like 6 or 7 gigs and the objective of 400$/week is accomplished and I'm proud of her! She's legit her own boss!!! That's awesome!!  Buuut.. she got a little greedy.. she just accepted a gig that alone will bring in 350/week witch almost doubles my objective that I gave her.. except now she needs help getting around.. she doesn't have a license and needs my help to get to her gigs, witch makes sense and I don't mind, except I also work a 9 to 5 and when I Finnish work I gotta go pick up the kids at daycare, make dinner and keep them occupied. I don't have time to be a taxi!! Plus this job she accepted is asking for receipts... now she's gonna need to apply for a buissness license and might need a few weeks to get things legal She's now asking me if she would accept more gigs if I would quit my job to help her out.. honestly.. I like my job.. I do want to support her but.. I made a choice last year to pursue a new career path and things have been going well.. it feels selfish to say no.. but at the same time it feels like giving up on a dream..

        "selftext": "My roommate (24f) and I (24m) have been living together for about 3 years. We dated for about a year and a half before we mutually broke up. We continued to live together and then moved to a new city to experience life in our careers together.  Some background: my roommate had a traumatic childhood where she was constantly belittled and treated poorly by everyone in her family. I, on the other hand, had a polar opposite childhood where I grew up in a very loving family. So because of this, my roommate and I view all aspects of life completely different. Our schedules are: she works a normal 8am-5pm and I work 6am-3pm but I have to work a lot of OT since I don't get paid as much as she does which causes me to have very little time to do chores.   My roommate and I have always had problems keeping our place clean but when we moved to the new city we made an agreement to not let the apartment get dirty. But we did not hold each other to that and our apartment got dirty again. So about 2 months ago, I had a conversation with her about the cleanliness of the apartment. We decided that she would cook and I would clean dishes. A month goes by and I have tried my best to keep up with the cleaning in the kitchen but wasn't able to keep up with the influx of dishes from cooking/baking.  But I haven't really seen my roommate cleaning in the other areas of the apartment so I decided to have another conversation with her.  I mentioned the cleanliness of the apartment again and requested that we uphold to our original agreement and she agreed. We made a plan where we would clean a different room each weekend. So life went on and again we did not hold ourselves to that agreement. She began to have some mental health problems which I was in total support of and tried to be there for her as best I can like I always have. I can't speak on if this is the reason why the agreements kept falling through. I've had some mental health problems as well because my mom passed 2 years ago but I've tried to not let it effect the people around me.  Now I'm a fairly observant person, so I, majority of the time, notice whether things have been moved/cleaned. Based off my observations, I've not seen evidence of her cleaning in the apartment. So this brings us to a few days ago, where she noticed I was upset about something. I expressed to her my frustrations regarding her effort into the cleanliness of the apartment. I mentioned that I'm putting a lot of effort and don't see much from her. She claims she been cleaning it's just I'm not seeing it. She likes to clean when I'm not around and refuses to clean while I am around the apartment.  So based off of that, I'm just not seeing the evidence of her cleaning. So I asked her to tell me what she has cleaned recently so I can figure out what I'm not seeing. She instantly got defensive and said I have no right to ask her for proof.   So AITA for asking my roommate for proof of her cleaning our apartment?",

        "selftext": "I have this friend I met in college, let\u2019s call him Jay. We\u2019ve known each other for about 3 years now, and have since graduated. Our friendship wasn\u2019t perfect by any means, and we\u2019ve had our ups and downs just like all friendships. Recently, I decided to text him to let him know how much I appreciated him. I texted him \u201cHey, sometimes you really piss me off, but I\u2019m definitely better for meeting you. Can\u2019t wait to see you again\u201d. I realized how bad that sounds out loud so I then text him \u201cIgnore that last text\u201d. Really, I was just referring to small, mildly annoying things he occasionally does. But he asked what I meant by that text. **SOME CONTEXT:**\u00a0 My friends back home and I have this tradition that every last week of August we all take a 5 day vacation in PTown, and I was so excited because I decided to invite Jay this time around. The day before we left for PTown, we took some mushroom gummies in the morning, and decided to take some THC gummies in the evening. I end up getting mildly stoned, but Jay\u2019s reaction was nothing like I had ever seen. He starts screaming and crawling all over the ground and knocking over all the furniture in my room. I tried to calm him down, but I had to have him admitted to the hospital. He might have overdosed, despite only taking 2 gummies.\u00a0 My friends from back home are still expecting me in PTown, so I end up taking the ferry. I text Jay that I\u2019ll pay for his ferry too when he gets released. 3 days later I finally hear from him, he gets his ferry ticket and meets me in PTown with the rest of my friends. He\u2019s pretty banged up and his body is pretty sore, but he\u2019s happy to be in PTown with me. Our last 2 days, we do things that are low energy since he just got released, but there\u2019s still something off about him. Every time one of my other friends said something, Jay would yawn or sigh, like he was bored. I get that he was tired, but my friends (who I told about the whole incident btw) seemed to take it personally.\u00a0 **END CONTEXT.**\u00a0 In my next text to Jay I tell him about the time he was yawning and sighing in front of my friends, and he flips out on me. He responds like \u201cDUDE I WAS FATIGUED FROM BEING IN THE FUKCING HOSPITAL FOR THREE FUCKING DAYS\u201d. And I\u2019m like \u201cyeah, I know. I was just trying to tell you that you do these quirky little things, but they\u2019re not a big deal at all\u201d. That doesn\u2019t work, because in his next text he tells me that his yawning wasn\u2019t \u201cquirky\u201d, like I said and that I was \u201cmaking this whole terrible thing about myself and how I felt\u201d. I obviously didn\u2019t mean to do that, but that\u2019s how he took it, and I tried explaining that. So I ended up deciding to give him some space, but it\u2019s been\u00a0 5 or so months and he still hasn\u2019t texted me back, even after I tried reaching out to him again.\u00a0 AITA. I feel like I might not have worded myself the best in our text conversation, but I also feel like he way overreacted to an easy misunderstanding.  ",

        "selftext": "I\u2019ve had a best friend since childhood. We share many hobbies and generally get along with a \u201cyou do you, I do me\u201d attitude. We\u2019ve had great times over the years, but at least once a year, there\u2019s a situation where he gets triggered, leading to a one-sided \u201cfight.\u201d My wife always reassures me, saying, \u201cHe is so silly, don\u2019t worry, he will come back as he always does.\u201d But I wonder if I\u2019m missing something. These situations usually begin with him venting about something stressful or self-destructive in his life. For instance, he often complains about his career and how it\u2019s ruining his mental health. I once suggested he explore other options, which triggered him. He\u2019s a \u201cgrind to get ahead\u201d kind of guy, but I value my peace, so we often clash on perspectives. The latest issue revolves around his addiction to a video game. We used to play it together when we were younger, but I quit because I didn\u2019t enjoy the anger it caused. He\u2019s recently returned to the game and keeps sending me memes and videos about it, despite knowing I haven\u2019t touched it in 8\u20139 years. He constantly complains about the game, yet tries to rationalize it as a \u201chobby\u201d he enjoys. This pattern of seeking validation is familiar. He always wants me to say, \u201cI\u2019m happy for you, bro,\u201d but it never ends there. When he bought a house, I congratulated him, but he wouldn\u2019t stop talking about how expensive it is and how he\u2019s grinding to pay it off. I once asked, \u201cIs it all worth it?\u201d and that triggered him too. Our conversations follow a predictable cycle: 1. He complains (\u201cWoe me and my hard life,\u201d either directly or via memes).2. I respond with sarcasm, suggesting he reanalyze the value of his choices.3. He deflects, saying things like, \u201cI\u2019m not like other people\u201d or \u201cIt isn\u2019t affecting me.\u201d4. I double down, voicing concern more directly, using analogies like, \u201cJust because an alcoholic has gone to therapy doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t still crave alcohol.\u201d5. He gaslights me, saying, \u201cChill out,\u201d or calling me \u201cdoom and gloom.\u201d6. When I point out his deflection and gaslighting, he blows up, accusing me of thinking I\u2019m \u201cbetter than everyone\u201d or knowing \u201ceverything.\u201d In the latest blow-up, he went further, calling me \u201ctoxic\u201d and saying things like, \u201cYou\u2019re the reason you have no friends,\u201d \u201cYou have a stick up your ass,\u201d and \u201cYou\u2019re mentally fucked up, not even autistic or have an excuse, just mentally sick and fucked up.\u201d I told him, \u201cI\u2019m going to let you get this out of your system,\u201d and walked away. My wife, who has witnessed similar situations before, was supportive and said, \u201cWTF.\u201d Now, I feel apathetic and plan to set boundaries: \u201cEither you get therapy, write me a plan for how you\u2019ll change your attitude, or please don\u2019t talk to me again.\u201d I wonder, though\u2014am I the problem? Have I been the A-hole my whole life and just never noticed? Am I losing my mind, or is this just a toxic dynamic I\u2019ve been stuck in?",

        "selftext": "Pretty much the title, I\u2019ve been working on cleaning out my house and I\u2019ve come across a lot of my siblings old video game mostly Nintendo 64, GameCube, Wii, and DS and 3DS.  NOW they know the left them here when they moved out 6 years ago and they\u2019ve never taken them despite all the times they have been here since, the games are on a shelf in the living room and clearly visible, now when ever I\u2019ve asked before it\u2019s \u201cnext time I\u2019ll grab them\u201d(I\u2019d like to say I\u2019m not mad that they haven\u2019t gotten them yet but I would very much like to use the shelf\u2019s now) and it\u2019s been several months since the last time I\u2019ve mentioned collecting them and they still haven\u2019t nor have they themselves mentioned it unless I\u2019ve brought it up.  I\u2019m not just going to throw the games out or donate them I play video games to and I know some of these are still pretty valuable for collectors. (The console for the games are here too btw) So WIBTA? Also since so many keep asking, It\u2019s my house I own it. I\u2019m 33F and sibling is 37NB  Also in our state anything left past 30 days can be considered abandoned. Edit for some Q and A:  Time frame: last time I asked was in September and specifically asked them to take them when they came down for Christmas because I would need the space after.Sibling was down for 3 days for Christmas and didn\u2019t box them up and take them Why haven\u2019t I boxed them up?: at the time they weren\u2019t in the way plus it\u2019s a shelf with a glass door and keeps them all safe. Some of my stuff is in there too Why I won\u2019t box them up and send/take them: I\u2019m not our mother nor am I paying for shipping and I know sibling won\u2019t.And I should not have to clean up after an adult for nothing. For context I\u2019m 33F sibling is 37NB. Distance/Visits: Sibling lives only like 40 minutes to hour away (depends on traffic/weather) and we usually see each other twice a month possibly more and we flip on who goes to who\u2019s house Why I need the space: I got a new bigger T.V and I needed a new entertainment center for it, old one was big with lots of storage space for games/blu-rays the new one only has about 1/3 the storage of the first",

        "selftext": " My boyfriend (2 years) has a tendency to say extremely problematic things from time to time with me, in front of our friends, on social media etc. and I have a tendency to correct him (non condescendingly) Usually when he says them, half of the time he starts to realize what he\u2019s saying midway and then ends his statement with \u201cyeah I should learn more about this before I say anything.\u201d It\u2019s usually about a left leaning topic such as trans rights or feminism, the patriarchy etc.  For some context on why this is relevant or important is because we both work in the same field and we deal with these kinds of topics a lot.  While most of the times he is receptive to hearing out why what he says is problematic, he also sometimes \u201cchooses\u201d not to be as sensitive or open-minded, and gets angry at me for telling him that what he\u2019s saying is coming off wrong.  I understand that it\u2019s also exhausting to be wrong about things all the time and I hate correcting him too. I just do it so he doesn\u2019t say the same thing in public. Usually I try not to make a big deal of it, and add in a quick line like \u201coops u should say it like ___ if that\u2019s what u mean\u201d or \u201chey u should reconsider that.\u201d  I can understand why is comes off bad but I really don\u2019t know how to let him just go around saying those things either.  We both have had many discussions on how we will never blame anyone for their thoughts on something, and as long as they are willing to be open to another pov, they\u2019re not \u201cwrong.\u201d This is because it\u2019s extremely common in our country to have crazy opinions straight out of school because of the family backgrounds of people strongly influence the way they think. Anyway getting to yesterday, he said that people who don\u2019t understand our field of work are not classy, and to that I responded that it\u2019s classist to look down on people for not understanding something just because you do.  He got really mad at me for calling him classist, and I told him multiple times that I didn\u2019t call him classist, I called his choice of words and sentence classist.  It (in my opinion) got heated up for no reason when he could have just been like \u201coh didn\u2019t see it like that oops.\u201d At some point he finally apologized and then he called me a \u201cbitch\u201d for making him feel bad??? and compared me to someone that I really don\u2019t like.  I told him that\u2019s not ok and then the argument got even more heated and finally I told him I\u2019m not going to take his shit anymore and finally he said  \u201cI\u2019m sorry for being transparent with you. I\u2019m not going to talk to you for a few days. I\u2019m sorry for calling you hateful things, I need to change my personality, I\u2019m going to change, so that no one gets hurt anymore\u201d I tried to stay as calm as I could during the entire argument and I really do understand why he\u2019s upset. But I have no idea if I should stop or not. He has told me multiple times that I make him a better person so.  AITA?  EDIT: I would like to clarify a few things that are being debated in the comments. His problematic statements are NOT normal in our field of work, but ARE normal by common people in the place that we live. Some examplea of things he's said are trans women are a problem because they're just men who want to win the olympics in the women's category and Women do have equality they just want more thats why they keep saying they dont",

I came home to see that a lot more of the cake had been eaten; So I asked my dad about it and he said he shared it with my brothers. I got irritated that he did that (also I told my brothers if they ate it they owe me money. I am broke highschool student) so I went to my brother's room and ask them for money and they said denied responsibility for eating and said that it was okay because my Dad gave it to them. I got angry at him because I told him that I didn't want them to have any of it, he said he wanted to repair the relationship between me and my brother by sharing something that I made. I don't think that it's his business to do that. He didn't seem to understand so I kind of told him off about the cake and how it hurt my feelings he still did not care. He felt like it was something useless to even talk about. Am I the ass hole for telling him off about the cake I made. Also for reference every single time I get mad or tell him off he just says I'm sorry that YOU got offended and never owns up to his action. Edit: this was not on his birthday it was 3 days after. Mom forgot to bake a cake because she has been busy with extended family passing. I also told me dad before I even baked the cake that they can't have it. Yes I wanted it to be a moment between me and my father. And no It wasn't a petty reason why I am not letting my brothers have it.",

        "selftext": "For background, I (16m) am on the autism spectrum and have another related mental illness that causes me to very obviously mirror other peoples traits, movements, catchphrases, etc. I've been working on it in therapy, but it's still an ongoing issue and I'm not making super obvious progress. The process has been slow and I've only gotten a bit better about being independent in my personality.   Today at lunch I was sitting with my normal group of friends (Victoria, Mark, Aisley, and Nicole) and everything seemed pretty normal? We interacted fine and had good conversations. The only notable thing is that I repeated what a lot of them said in silly voices (when we were joking around) and copied this movement that Mark does a lot. He does this thing where he leans forward and wiggles his fingers in peoples faces muttering Do as I say! Do as I say! He's done this for years and I've picked it up since we've known each other. I did it to Victoria and everyone went really quiet. I assumed the joke fell flat and so I just went back to eating. The rest of lunch was normal enough and I didn't think twice about it. We walked to our next classes together and kept messing around in the halls. After that class finished and I was walking to the last class of the day, some girl I didn't know walked up to me and called me a leech and an asshole for making everyone at the table so uncomfortable when I did that movement at lunch. I sat there and just blinked at her, which I assume she took as rude because she stormed off.    When I got home I got my phone (I left it in my room) and checked it. Turns out I had a bunch of messages from Nicole that she wanted to warn me that I might get kicked out of the table. Apparently this is an ongoing issue and they haven't liked me for a while. I asked Mark about it but I think he blocked me? When I asked Victoria about it she said that it was because I kept copying them and it was weird to be around me. I tried to explain that I didn't really mean to creep them out, but that I was sorry and would try to be better. She didn't want to hear it and I guess I'm just... kicked out now? I just want to know if I'm actually an asshole or if I'm valid in feeling a bit upset about all of this. So, AITA for stealing my friends' personalities? ",

I think he\u2019s taking it personal especially since i\u2019m the youngest of like seven other kids but I genuinely don\u2019t mean harm when it takes me a bit to respond so it bugs me when he sees it that way it also bugs me with his replies like just say a heart back or something no need to make me feel guilty for having a life. I live with my mother full time so I asked her for her opinion and she was obviously on his side so i\u2019m probably definitely overreacting but I still want to see others opinions and before people tell me its not hard to occasionally check your messages I know I just am so terrible at getting back to people or I see his messages at 3AM and forget to reply in the morning I think its also hard because every time I take to long to respond he gets all weird and it upsets me, anyways please tell me, AITA?

        "selftext": "We got married in September. She moved in with my at a guesthouse I own 40km south of the city she works in. After a week she moved back to her apartment with her brother because of the compute. They had a roommate that's lease ended on 1 Jan and I moved in with her. Her brother and her own the apartment, but since his company said he has to be back at the office one week a month, he has been traveling from his home city to stay in the apartment.  It's a two bed one bath. The first weeks weeks we were together was great. First time we have gotten to live together just us as a married couple. Then her brother came over. He's a decent guy and I like him. He's also an actuary and doing fine.  He and my wife (brother and sister) are best friends. They have an incredible relationship. Two nights ago in bed she told me he will be staying two weeks a month till August when he saves up enough to buy another place. I told her that we (34M, 32F) have not gotten any time to be married couple and she wants  a baby so when the baby comes (hopefully later this year) we will have never had any time to just be us as a couple, develop that relationship.  First thing the next morning she told him and he wanted to move out. She was depressed the whole day. That night I sat us all down at the dinner table and said we need to talk to each other. I explained myself again that we never got time to be a couple and he agreed. I invited him to stay as long as he wanted. My wife was happy and he said he would rather move to his own place and grow to our full couple potential everyone agreed. The next night my wife and I were at the mall shopping for a potato ricer so I could make us all gnocchi. When he called and we had to rush him to the hospital because, well no one told me why. When we got back to the appartment to fetch him he has a runny nose but they decided he could drive his own car and she would go with him. I stayed as I has a late night work commitment (IT deployment) They went, the doctor put him on a drip and they came back with some over the counter flu meds. That was yesterday. Today I joked that he could rent a place that my wife and I are looking to buy as a investment property. It's a joke because none of us can afford to live there if it wasn't paying for itself as an investment.  The both took that extremely seriously and my wife said that I made him feel unwelcome in the apartment. Am I the asshole?  Edit: my wife and I rent the apartment from her and her brother at full market value.  He moved in because his work from home policy changed. When I agreed to move here and away from my place outside the city, it was just my wife and I renting the apartment. So that she and he would not have to go through the trouble of finding a tenant to take over.",

He made a card with the information on it. I\u2019m not sure when I saw it. He had been unreliable in the past. I wrote said gift card number down to verify the amount was correct.  Jump to last feb. I found the handwritten numbers and thought they were a gift card of mine since it was just jumbled into my stack of cards. My dad has been to this place many times since the gift was given. I never asked if he used it. I put it in, it worked! And, it was a lot! I used some of the funds to help my friend at the same time. I honestly didn\u2019t remember his card existed in that moment. I enjoyed what was purchased and kept living.  My dad went to use the gift card this year. \u201cArchived/unaccepted\u201d My brother does the due diligence and finds it\u2019s been used and the dates correlated with my activity.  He confronts me and says I am a thief and evil. I tell both of them I am sorry, I definitely used it, I didn\u2019t realize it at the time and I would pay my dad back immediately, dad says not now. This isn\u2019t good enough for my brother. He won\u2019t speak to me and had a full blown meltdown (manic depressive).  So, aita? My dad agreed to let me buy him another one or simply go with him next time he wants to make a purchase there but my brother won\u2019t accept that deal. He finally texted me today saying he has nothing to say to me until I admit guilt (I admitted I did it, just not maliciously) and that he won\u2019t talk until the card is replaced (dad said absolutely not and it\u2019s his card and he will let me know when he wants it replaced\u2026 idk why but after the last text I told him if it helps my relationship with my brother I am happy to go ahead and get the purchase taken care of).  I don\u2019t understand, my dad and I have the discrepancy and came to agreeable terms for repayment. ",

        "selftext": "I\u2019m in a computer systems servicing class, and we have a rule where we\u2019re not supposed to be playing games on the computers during class time. I was assigned a computer with administrator privileges, so I can monitor the other computers in the lab. One day, I noticed that my classmate was playing a game on their computer. Since we\u2019re not supposed to be doing that, I decided to check on it using my admin privileges to confirm if they were actually playing a game or if I was just imagining it. When I checked, I saw that they were indeed playing a game, so I decided to mess with their computer to let them know they were breaking the rule. I didn\u2019t delete anything or do anything too extreme, but I did interfere with their work. Afterward, my classmate reacted to what I did, but they didn\u2019t say anything specific. They didn\u2019t seem upset or anything, so I figured it wasn\u2019t a big deal. I thought maybe they were just brushing it off. Later, I told the teacher that my classmate was playing a game on their computer. The teacher responded by saying that they were actually looking at their presentation. That\u2019s when I realized that what I thought was a game was actually part of their presentation. At that point, I felt really guilty because I had messed with something that was important to them, and I didn\u2019t even realize it at the time. I know I was trying to follow the class rules, but I feel like I might have overstepped. I didn\u2019t mean to mess up their presentation, but I still feel bad about it. AITA for messing with their computer, even though I thought they were playing games? Even though they did not say anything negative I still feel like the Asshole.",

        "selftext": "Am I the asshole for confronting my neighbor? So it\u2019s not my neighbor but my sister\u2019s. My sister lives at the corner of her neighborhood and these two black trucks always accelerate around the corner. She has two young kids that are just now learning how to bike and it\u2019s been bothering her for some time. We pulled into the driveway around 11pm at night when all the sudden one of the black trucks speeds by us. My sister is insisting that we go and confront him. So I drive us over there. She introduces herself as his neighbor and says that his truck and another truck always speed around the corner and that she has 2 young kids. He says the other truck is his son\u2019s.  She politely asked him if they could slow down. His reply was \u201cdo you have radar lasers in your eyes\u201d? She said excuse me and repeats himself. At that point I got annoyed and said let\u2019s go, this guy is a dickhead. He raised his voice and called her a degenerate mother because while her kids are riding bikes she\u2019s sitting in the road near the corner\u2026 but she\u2019s only there in case one of those trucks speeds around the corner.  At that point I repeated myself much louder this time to make sure they both heard me. She starts walking back and he says step on my property to me. I tell him I\u2019m not stepping on your property and we start hurling insults at each other. We drive off still hurling insults at each other. I later found out this guy has a reputation for being a dick. They live four houses down from each other and I\u2019d hate for him to speed by out of spite and something bad happen. I told my sister (since she lives there) to go by and reintroduce herself and apologize. To basically say \u201c11pm was not the time for that and my brother was way out of line. He gets defensive of me, but we were wrong and for that I\u2019m sorry. Do you think when you come around the corner you could just slow down? I\u2019m just looking out for my kids.\u201d AITA for reciprocating his energy and is the apology a good idea for quick deescalation?",

        "selftext": "I (24m) have a selfish and narcissistic sister, 'Sarah' (18f). I have written a post about her a few months ago, and explained why she's selfish and narcissistic . So, I don't think I need to expand on that anymore. But here's the story; Last Sunday, I cleaned the entire house, all by myself, around 1am because it's easier to do when everyone else is asleep. I cleaned the ceiling fan in the living room, dusted the shelves and frames, swept the floor, vacuumed the floor, and mopped the floor. I have no trouble doing these because I'm always home since I'm still studying, and my elder sister is working. So, it's fair for me to do the chores, although my elder sister helps out as well with the laundry and folding the clothes (I fold my own clothes).  Why don't our younger sister help out? Like I've said, I've made a post about it, and it's a pretty long story. To cut it short, she's simply just lazy, selfish, and narcissistic. Today, Sarah saw a bug or whatever and used a lizard spray to kill it. Lizard spray is more dense and oily compared to a mosquito spray. Why did she use a lizard spray when we have a mosquito spray? I honestly have no clue. So, I told her to mop the floor since the floor is oily and I just cleaned the house a few days ago. To me it's fair since she was the one who caused the mess and I was the one who cleaned the house. But she got defensive, saying Why me? Why do I have to mop the floor? (goes to show how narcissistic she is). I kept quiet and just gave her a look. She then got a wet tissue and wiped the floor, instead of mopping it (goes to show how lazy she is). Not only that, but she didn't even wipe it properly because the floor was still oily and the stain got worse because she used a wet tissue that is soapy (goes to show how selfish she is). She then went to her room without a word. In the end, I had to mop the floor again because she made it worse. I didn't call her out because it's just useless when dealing with someone selfish like that. It's like talking to a wall. If I had call her out, all she will do is get mad, play victim, and start a fight with me, which I'm not interested in because it was 10pm and also an unnecessary argument since I know I'm not in the wrong. To be honest, I'm writing this just to vent out. But what do you guys think? Am I the asshole in this situation? Edit: If you think I just hate my sister and I'm being too harsh on her. Keep in mind, the stain on the floor was literally next to the corner of our dining table, which is dangerous because anyone could've slipped and hit their head on the sharp edge of the table. Imagine losing an eye because of it. The fact that she didn't clean up the floor immediately until I told her to, goes to show how selfish she is. She literally just sat there, on her phone, while the floor was hazardous. So yeah, she really is selfish. Edit 2: The point of this post is not about her not listening to me or that she used wet tissues instead of the mop like I told her to. The point here is that she doesn't take responsibility for her own actions. If you made a mess, would you leave it or would you clean it up? Exactly. She didn't clean it up until I told her to. On top of that, she didn't even clean the floor properly, spreading the oil even more. Not only that, but she also just immediately went to her room, leaving the floor that she half-heartedly cleaned. Also, like in the first edit, it is dangerous because the floor is slippery. What if one of us slipped and hit the corner of the table? The whole point is about her taking responsibility, not about this mop vs tissue that so many are bringing up. Edit 3: Some of you are calling me the asshole. Okay, try putting yourself in my shoes. What would you do if you had just cleaned your house, and then someone, either your family or friends, just made a mess. Would you just let it go or would you tell them to take responsibility. Majority of you would go for the latter, right? Okay. Now, how would you feel after telling them to clean up their mess, only for them to play victim and clean it up half-heartedly, causing you to clean it yourself in the end? Would you be delighted or would you be somewhat mad or disappointed? Ask yourself that question and see whether you will behave differently or the same as me. Keep in mind, deep inside I was mad, but I didn't say anything. Just as written in the post, I didn't call her out or anything. I just cleaned it up myself, made this post to vent out, and moved on. Edit 4: Sure, maybe I'm the asshole for the way I'm writing this. But that's not the point. The point is about her not taking responsibilities. So please. make judgement based on the content of the story itself, not exterior stuff like the way I'm writing, me being emotional, the post is too long, etc. Final edit (hopefully): If you are wondering why a bunch of adults are living under one roof, I am Asian, and we live in Asia. It is normal for Asians to still live with their parents, unless they get married and have their own family. For single people, most of us live with our parents, even if we're 30 years old. At the end of the day, there's nothing wrong with it because it's just the culture in most Asian families, same as how it is common for Americans to live on their own once they start college. It might sound weird to you, but it's our culture, so please don't be rude about it. Besides, us adults living under one roof is not even the point of this post. I don't get why some are bringing it up when it's not even the main issue.",

Her dishes didn\u2019t have food on them but they still weren\u2019t washed. It had been nearly 4 days when I felt enough was enough and I called her to clean her things (I didn\u2019t see her in the flat during this period). She gave some excuse that she was caught up in something urgent, I was getting really annoyed and told her that I didn\u2019t care and she should just come back to get her dishes done cuz none of us are able to use that sink (there\u2019s 6 people in total in this flat). She paused, apologised and went \u201cwell if you really need the complete space, can you help me wash the dishes? It should be relatively clean too\u201d.

        "selftext": "Ok folks I'll be honest, this is incredibly low stakes and more to prove a point than anything else. The long and short of it is my husband asked me to turn off the lights after I laid down. We're on vacation, it's currently about 09:00 in the morning, and I'd turned the light on to read something on the computer as I don't like using my laptop in the dark.  After I sat back down on the couch next to him, he suggested I get some more sleep as I hadn't slept well. I agreed, laid down, and that's when he asked me to get the light. He couldn't because our infant daughter fell asleep on him, and we know if we move her within 30 minutes of falling asleep she'll wake up and be super crabby. As I was getting the light, I lightly accused him of AH behavior. My reasoning? He didn't say anything while I was sitting up, or even by my computer. He argues that because I left the light on, I'm the AH for wasting electricity. I then told him if it went up here, he'd be labelled the bigger AH and he said prove it. So here I am.  AITA for leaving a light on? Quick ETA: ok y'all, I hear you. I definitely came here full of bluster. I acknowledge calling him names was petty and childish, it's just how we've always played. Regardless, I should've just gotten the light after I was done and I've already promised him apology nachos. I made sure to send the link to my husband, and he and I have taken turns reading the answers. Respectful/neutral ones we just nod and agree with, more biting ones make us laugh.

        "selftext": "I (22f) have an older brother (John-32m) who has been with his fianc\u00e9 (Jane-30f) for 4 years. They have a 4 month old. Jane found out she was pregnant at 5 and a half weeks and immediately called my mum to tell her. Mum was confused, but still very excited. Jane said she was going to tell John when he got back from his work trip. A few hours later, she called again, sobbing, saying she has \u2018insatiable cravings\u2019. Mum made a joke like \u2018isn\u2019t it a bit early for cravings?\u2019 and Jane went OFF on her. She started yelling about how this was \u2018her pregnancy\u2019 and no one else\u2019s. It was an odd reaction. she also apologised for her outburst by blaming it on hormones. When my brother returned from his trip, him and Jane left to stay at her mother\u2019s and we didn\u2019t see her until after the baby was born. John said this was because Jane was afraid of losing the pregnancy and wanted to be with her mum and we needed to respect boundaries. Whenever someone would ask about Jane or the baby, they would shut it down with vague answers like \u2018Every pregnancy is different\u2019 or \u2018She\u2019s carrying small, which isn\u2019t unusual\u2019. They barely shared anything about the pregnancy. No ultrasound pictures, no baby shower, and Jane didn\u2019t want anyone around during the delivery. I also discovered that every craving she listed, came from one article about pregnancy cravings (she even listed multiple items in the same order as the article). When the baby was born, we were finally allowed to see Jane and John (and baby of course). It was very bittersweet as we all wished we could have been there for Jane to help out, but Jane and John both reassured us that we did help out by staying away during the pregnancy. The weirdest part though, is how Jane describes the birth. She claims she had an epidural via IV drip into her HAND (edited bc I didn't elaborate--)\u2026 which is NOT how those are administered. When I asked clarifying questions (thinking she had gotten confused, which is understandable) she shut down and refused to answer, like how she would during the pregnancy. She said the baby had 'latching issues' because he was born with no umbilical cord stump. This can technically happen, but it\u2019s a rare and fatal medical condition that their baby does not have. The final straw was when she told us that the baby \u2018basically fell out of her\u2019 within an hour of being in labour, despite my brother telling us how hard the birth was (and even stating that was why they weren\u2019t going to try for any more kids). Mum is on the same side as me, and has been noting this inconsistencies and inaccuracies but doesn\u2019t know how to bring it up. And their reactions don\u2019t help. A few days ago, my brother text mum saying her doubt of Jane is disrespectful and they both want full apologies from the both of us for 'bullying' Jane about her pregnancy/labour. I haven't made any outright accusations about it, nor have I said any of this to Jane. I've only asked questions when she brings the birth/pregnancy up. AITA for having doubts?",

        "selftext": "We have a lot of kids age 14 down to age 2 with another baby on the way. Everyone age 4 and up has assigned chores throughout the day but the biggest portion of them happen after school from 4-5pm but it takes a ton of effort to keep them on task. Example of the expectations is for the 14 year old: pick up dog poop in the backyard, fold & put away his laundry, clean his room (that it shared with 2 younger brothers & they all need to help), brush his dog, and collect trash from the main level once a week. I ask each kid to pitch in on what they can handle for their age & then try to hold them accountable for what their assignments are.  It is not as stressful on nights when we don\u2019t have to rush older kids to get changed into uniforms & out the door by 5:15 to have my husband take them to activities because then it\u2019s just eating into their free time if it\u2019s not done yet. I feel stressed by being left with all the little kids in a chaotic environment which means I have to watch them closer if it\u2019s not tidy and toddler safe and have to get dinner on the table plus grade my 8th & 7th graders homeschool assignments while my husband and the helpful kids are out of the house.  So I asked my husband who teleworks to come out of his office when he\u2019s done with work (sometime between 4:30 and 5) to help manage kids so I\u2019m not doing it alone with so many moving parts. He agreed to help more but he doesn\u2019t care if kids are actually done or not and still takes off for activities. I don\u2019t want them to go if they aren\u2019t completely done with their chores. My husband thinks I have too high of expectations and shouldn\u2019t care if for example a kid says they are done but didn\u2019t pick up dog poop. I think this teaches them to not be responsible and also has future consequences that directly impact me like when kids are playing in the backyard and come running in with dog poop stuck in their shoes that I now have to clean.  This is a reoccurring conflict in our marriage that I want the house to get straightened up at certain points throughout the day because it makes my job as a homeschooling stay at home mom easier to monitor for safety if things don\u2019t spiral out of control. AITA for trying to hold kids accountable or for even trying to keep the house picked up? ",

I'd never say that without having been asked, and even then, I would've said something to change the subject or flat-out lie and say it's the most gorgeous engagement ring of all time. Except for the fact that I got engaged two months ago, and my fiancee got me a moonstone ring because that's my birthstone, and that's WHAT I WANTED. My cousin simply couldn't accept that and kept going on and on about how diamonds are emblematic of engagement rings and that my fiancee just cheaped out. Imagine my surprise when she posts her engagement announcement on insta and her precious diamond is almost invisible. I don't think words can describe how small it is. Whatever you're imagining, it's smaller. I congratulated her on her post and thought of leaving it at that, but she DMed asking what I thought, so I just asked if that's the size she wanted, and that turned into a full-blown dumpster fire. She got the rest of the family involved and now I'm bullying her. Really can't see how. [Here's a link to a REFERENCE of the ring](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/42502790228216475/)",

        "selftext": "I (19F) have been living with my roommate (18F) since the beginning of the Fall semester. In the first few weeks, things were fine, but over time, we became distant and passive-aggressive about our shared space. I have acute migraines and need the room pitch black to sleep, as any light triggers migraines. I\u2019ve talked to my roommate multiple times about this, and while she seemed to understand, lights continued to be left on, including her extremely bright alarm clock. I tried to handle it and sleep with some lights on, but she then brought in a new light that illuminated the whole room in purple, adding to the already bright alarm clock. One night, I tried to wake her up to talk about it, but she was asleep, and I couldn\u2019t turn the light off. After waiting a couple of hours for it to turn off on its own (it didn\u2019t), I unplugged it. I planned to talk to her about it in the morning, but when I woke up, she had left for class and left a note saying I needed to stop touching her stuff, and that the light would have turned off on its own. I didn\u2019t think much of it and decided to discuss it with her later. When she came back, she immediately started complaining about me touching her things, saying she likes having a light in the room, and that she\u2019s had to compromise on everything. She mentioned how she likes keeping the window open at night, and I always close it because I\u2019m afraid of break-ins. She also mentioned hating my curtain that blocks sunlight (the one she said I could have), and how I turn off her fairy lights at night, which I did to reduce light when she was asleep. She argued that the new light wasn\u2019t facing me, so it shouldn\u2019t be an issue, but it was still bright enough to illuminate the whole room. I tried to explain that this wasn\u2019t just about comfort\u2014it\u2019s a medical issue for me, and the lack of sleep is affecting my migraines and school performance. She didn\u2019t seem to understand and kept insisting that I need to compromise now. I understand she feels like I\u2019m not letting her use her lights, but my sleep is being severely impacted, and I\u2019m struggling with migraines and poor mental health because of it. So, AITA for turning off her lights so I can sleep?",

        "selftext": "I (F16) absolutely used to Adore my English teacher (F49) until recently. So in December of 2024 i turned 16 and i was so so so excited for my birthday and i had been talking for weeks about it to my favorite teacher (English teacher). She seemed kind of careless about it but i didn't think anything about it. Worth to note, i have extremely strong emotions. So i was super excited about my birthday, smiling and giggling all morning. During English class (first period) me and my best friend sat outside and talked about our grades with the teacher. My bestie asks if the teacher has forgotten something. It takes a while before says asks if it was my birthday and i joyfully said yes. For the record in my country every single day of the year have 1-2 names like tied to it so if it's your name or middle name it's your names birthday. My English teachers middle name happened to have a name birthday the same day as my normal birthday. I asked her jokingly where my happy birthday was. And she replied with well where is my cake? it honestly pisses me off a bit. I know it doesn't have anything with religious reasons either as she has said herself that she's an atheist and does in fact celebrate birthdays. Her sassy answer made me kind of upset especially when almost all of my other teachers wished me a happy birthday. The special needs teacher specifically was super joyful towards me. To her i had just briefly said it once and she remembered (my birthday that is) . I give all my love to her for that. It made me feel like why can everyone, even teachers i don't like wish me a happy birthday but not my favorite teacher. I want to include one more thing. She might have actually mocked my attachment issues. I used to struggle with attachment issues (towards teachers) in middle school due to being bullied, having barely any friends and really poor mental health. I have told max 5 people about what i went through. My English teacher was one. She said like okay, see you tomorrow. I asked why she had responded so short and well pretty much unattended to the thing i told her and she simple said well, we don't want you to become attached again now do we. It might not have been a mockery but it really didn't feel positive as it was a fresh wound and at the time i was still struggling with getting unattached to my old teachers. I told her to piss off after that and she didn't seem to happy about it.  So AITA for thinking she is acting well like an A-hole? Edit one : i knew a lot of people would think i'm the A-hole and i understand why but telling me that nobody has to care about me, that's pretty fucking mean. Like i understand that she doesn't owe me anything but that doesn't mean NOBODY has to care about me. I know it was childish of me to be upset but sometimes that's how life works. As people also said i am still a literal child, i am well aware that the behavior won't fly and i am trying to get out of it. Also for the people saying teacher attachment is inappropriate and weird trust me i know, i have apologized to teachers in the past i was attached to since i knew that my behavior was inappropriate. I'm doing my best to get away from that issue but it's hard.",

        "selftext": "I\u2019m a single dad to a 15 year old girl. We live in an area where we get a lot of snow every winter. Around the time she was 11, I taught her how to shovel and usually, we do it together. We have a decent sized driveway and walkway. Sometimes, if it\u2019s too icy, I\u2019ll do the whole thing myself. Over the weekend, we got some unexpected snow while I was at work. I called my daughter and asked that she shovel out a bit of the driveway so I\u2019ll have room to park and get out the next day, as well as shovel the walkway and steps. She said yes. When I came home, the entire driveway was shoveled and the walkway and steps were cleared perfectly. I thanked her and said she did a good job. She then told me that when she went out to shovel, she saw our neighbor (who\u2019s a couple years older than her) was shoveling his walkway. She offered him $40 of her own money to shovel for her and he accepted.  I told her that I had asked her to shovel, not the neighbor and it was something assigned to her. She asked what the big deal was, as it got done. She also pointed out when she has her own house some day, she can easily just pay someone to do it so she doesn\u2019t have to do it. I told her she wasn\u2019t in trouble but next time it snowed, she was helping me shovel and going forward if I asked her to do it, she was expected to do it. She seemed a little disappointed but didn\u2019t argue. I was talking to my mom about the situation and she told me I completely overreacted, and pointed out my daughter has a point. The job got done and it shouldn\u2019t matter how it gets done, as long as it does, and the neighbor kid willingly did it (which I confirmed with him later that he was happy to do it for the extra cash). My mom said I should\u2019ve praised my daughter\u2019s initiative.  So, now I\u2019m left wondering if I was the asshole for lecturing my daughter on this.  Edit: To those asking, she got the money from babysitting. She works for a different neighbor twice a week and is paid $18/hr. We\u2019ve had talks about money constantly over the years, ever since she was old enough to receive birthday and Christmas money and decide how to spend it. She knows the value of the dollar, that once you spend money it\u2019s gone, and to think before you buy. She says to her, this was worth the $40.  And to those asking why it bugged me, I thank you because I wasn\u2019t even sure myself. I think I just want to make sure that she has these skills, but I also understand people\u2019s points that she has the skill and she can now decide to use it if she\u2019s in a situation like this one.  **Update*** I want to thank everyone who talked some sense into me. You all were right, it really doesn\u2019t matter how it gets done. As well as the fact that yes, there are times I contract out work of my own, so it\u2019s unfair to expect otherwise of her. One of my main priorities is that she\u2019s able to do things on her own. I won\u2019t always be around to help and I want her to be independent. But, I realize now, this was her being independent and getting something done, just in a different way. I spoke with her and apologized for lecturing her. I also added I was proud of her for taking initiative and explained why I reacted the way I did. Additionally, I thanked her for getting it done, regardless of how it was. She forgave me and everything is good now. We did have another talk about money but she insists that\u2019s how she wanted to spend it, so I\u2019m going to leave it alone for now. But she says she appreciates me admitting I was wrong. I told her next time, she can either hire the neighbor again or do it herself, I don\u2019t care as long as it\u2019s what they both want.  Some people said I should force her to put more into savings. She already puts a good amount away on her own. I\u2019m going to continue to let her decide what works for her.  Also, to those going to either extreme that either 1) I was wrong for having her shovel because she\u2019s a girl or 2) assuming I\u2019m only making her do chores and expecting her to do them herself because she\u2019s a girl, you\u2019re wrong. I do everything that I ask her to do, and I also occasionally contract out tasks. I don\u2019t care if she does in the future. This was a genuine mistake on my part and not anything malicious where I expect more/less of my daughter because she\u2019s a girl. ",

It didn't offend me at all. I called them fat (okay fatty haha) in a joking way and I was assure that they knew I was joking- and I never meant to ACTUALLY bring them down on purpose.  I was always made fun of for my appearance and my looks and all that shit when I was in elementary up until now. I thought that it was normal to make fun of it. But- I never actually meant it if I did make comments. I would only do it if my friends started making fun of each others appearances.  I found out recently from one of my friends that is apart of this friend group that the girls were upset and uncomfortable by these Jokes. I texted her and told her I understood and i wouldn't make these jokes anymore. So since i was at home at the time, I texted both of the girls I hurt. I apologized to one and they accepted my apology. (Im aware apologies dont fix everything and I still left that person hurt.)  But Then i go and text the second girl I have yet to apologize to and I found out she blocked me weeks ago. Even though I never actually said those fat jokes directly to her, she still blocked me. I feel like a Pos.  Mind you, Im very aware that I tend to not think before I speak a lot of the times and I reassured them to tell me if I say anything that hurts their feelings. But I just found out that they were uncomfortable with letting me know. So that makes me feel like an even bigger pos.  ive apologized, ive done everything I can to assure that ive realized my mistake but I feel like they dont want to be friends with me anymore.  I grew up with barely any friends, always one or two, or none. So losing friends makes me very emotional.  ",

        "selftext": "My (24F) best friend (24F) of seven years ghosted me. She claims I changed, cause I used to pride myself on my independence but now rely on my BF.  We\u2019ve always split the tab via PayPal, but she often forgets to pay me back. Recently at the gym, when I reminded her, she said she was tight on money, so I told her it's ok. But she added: Not that you would relate So naturally, I asked her to elaborate.Now that you've got a sugar daddy, you must have saved a lot of money HUH I reminded her that I\u2019ve only been a full-time student since July, have never dropped out, and care for a chronically ill parent, too. So what if I don't work at the moment? I also pointed out that she works part-time but only spends her money on vacations with her BF. I asked why she couldn\u2019t just be happy for me. I\u2019ve always been there for her through her struggles, including her dropping out of high school and BF problems. I asked her if she's jealous. She\u2019s a shy introvert, while I\u2019m an eccentric extrovert. We both have new relationships. She only told me about her Swiss long-distance boyfriend in December, even though they started dating in August, cause she didn\u2019t wanna jinx it. Explains why she often skipped our gym and dinner dates, as she was often abroad or working retail.  As for me, I\u2019ve been dating my BF since September. We\u2019ve known each other since 2019 through a language app and after months of helping him through paperwork, he got a work visa and moved to Germany. I showed him around and barely two weeks in, he asked me out. I understood her anxiety and stress but she didn't understand my silence on my BF. He\u2019s funny and forthcoming, a bit too clingy but also pretty and protective. I kept the relationship secret because I'm tired of getting lovebombed only for the flirt to turn out abusive & coked up. The way a man treats me is thr biggest social proof to me.  Finally, I broke the news to her, but she was pissed. I shoulda shared sooner, given how TMI and shameless I always am. I said it hurt me, too, so she she apologized, too, for hiding her own relationship and said she's burnt out from retail and her trade/apprenticeship. When she asked how I afford my trips and shopping sprees since I quit my job, I told her my BF paid. She seemed perplexed and mentioned that her BF is rather modern, they go 50/50 but she struggles a lot cause he's an older IT specialist and it takes a toll on her to live up to his living standard. Not to mention the long distance struggle. She visits him since she lives with her mom while he lives alone an has privacy. My BF, on the other hand, fights for the bill, hates my thrifting and feels uncomfortable about visiting me empty handed. He even calls me his little housewife cause I cook for him. I know I could have picked my words better but I'm not a fucking sugar baby, I'm not mooching off of him, considering I treat him like a king when he's at my place. ",

If it\u2019s money I got you and u can literally take however long you need to pay me back no problem bc I feel like him driving your car there later is a good solutionC:It\u2019s not about the money, but I appreciate you saying that. It\u2019s just the layout of this outing and his car situation L:Of course you\u2019re welcome!  Yeah it is is a weird timeline I understand, but I feel like the best solution is for him to drive in with your car later? Put yourself in S shoes, it would be hurtful. I\u2019m sure your bf would be okay coming in later but at the end of the day it\u2019s your decision C:Yea I know it would be hurtful if i didn\u2019t go that\u2019s why maybe I thought if I can\u2019t make the dinner reservation I\u2019ll just meet them later, but to be mean was not my intentionI\u2019m going to ask him what he wants to do. I think if we drive together we can uber from S place to the restaurant and he can go somewhere to eat aroundL:No not necessarily mean but like just sad bc this has been planned for 2 weeks, he can\u2019t drive later in your car there later? So he\u2019s not waiting too long?C:I told him he can either come with and just hang out alone or come later.

        "selftext": "Names have been changed to protect identities. I attended a party where my friend Cody shared a shocking revelation about our mutual friend Derek. He revealed that Derek\u2019s biological father is not his real dad, and Derek is completely unaware of this. Intrigued, I asked Cody how he had come to know this information. Cody explained that Derek\u2019s mother has been having an ongoing affair with his stepfather, who Derek has never met. Cody disclosed that his mother is fully aware of this situation. The only reason she hasn\u2019t divorced his stepfather is because she is waiting for him to die so that she can inherit his entire estate. To my astonishment, Cody showed me a picture of his stepfather, and to my surprise, Derek bears a striking resemblance to him. Cody made me promise not to reveal this information to Derek, as it would not only devastate Derek\u2019s family but also his parents\u2019. He warned me that breaking up a family would have devastating consequences. It has been approximately eight years since I had this conversation with Cody, and we have not spoken since. However, I maintain a close relationship with Derek. Occasionally, I feel guilty for not telling Derek the truth, but I am reluctant to take responsibility for potentially causing irreparable harm to a family- especially since his mom passed a few weeks ago.

        "selftext": "This is kind of a weird situation, but I (50f) live in a condo & share a 4 car driveway with my condo neighbors. It\u2019s a tandem space, on a busy city street with bike lanes, and they have two cars and we have none. For the past few months one of their cars has been parked unmoved in their spot closest to the street, so the other driver drives his car into and out of their other space using our side of the driveway. This shouldn\u2019t be so annoying, but when they moved in they used our driveway whenever they wanted, like if they had workmen or guests, etc, so I would get mad at them and tell them to stop doing that in email and in person. They also mentioned to the condo association that they wanted to remove the condo trash cans that were technically in their space, and put them into our finished back yard so they could expand their parking space so three cars would fit. This turned into a conversation about how the trash cans were scraping the parked cars in the drive way, (we were renting the space out at the time so there was less room for the trash cans, but no one\u2019s car was getting scratched,) so we ended up getting rid of the trash cans entirely so they could do what they wanted with that space. Needless to say, I have a cool/cold relationship with them and I do hold grudges, so I might be the asshole. Which brings me to today; I saw my neighbor once again driving out of the driveway on my side of the shared driveway so I sent him an email and asked him to stop doing this, and instead just move his wife\u2019s car forward and park behind it. He sent me an email reply and he was livid!! He told me that he was surprised by my email, \u201cwondered if I had read the condo bylines saying that it was common space\u201d and how he shovels the sidewalk and is a good neighbor\u2026 etc, he was ready to go to war! (I also shovel and clean the backyard, so he\u2019s not the only one\u2026) He\u2019s a lawyer and looooves to lawyer us in conversations, I guess to impress or threaten or whatever. I\u2019m not sure what I should say, or if I should reply, I definitely want to deescalate his outrage, but I also feel like I have a point. But I could be blinded by my history with them, and my dislike for them. Eveyone else seems to find them to be fine, so I could be a the one in the wrong\u2026 so, AITA?",

        "selftext": "I (17f) should probably give a bit of context to my situation. I come from a low-income household where I live with my mother and younger brother. My father left my home several years ago, and my mother is a housewife, so I'm the breadwinner of the family. I work as an artist who makes commissions for others. A couple months ago, I found this girl (19f) on a shared Discord server and friended her. I introduced myself, showed her a couple of my art pieces, and asked her if she wanted to submit a commission so that I can make her something. She said she wasn't sure and wanted some time, which I respected. A couple days later I sent her another message and she said that she wasn't interested. I got desperate since I was struggling financially so I told her about my circumstances and asked her to help me. She was sympathetic and commissioned me. We started talking after that. I told her about my goal at the end of the month and she promised to help me. I said I wanted to try myself first. I learned that she was saving up for college and to move out of her parents' home. A month later, I reminded her of the promise she made. She told me that she was saving up, so I told her to just send me a fraction of that. I asked her for some financial support a few more times, whether to help me with a company idea, or because my brother was being hospitalized, and she did. Last month, I found out that one of my close friends (17f) who was also low-income had a getting hospitalized from a life-threatening condition. I was worried about her and wanted to help, so I told her about my online friend. After that, I texted the online explaining the situation and asked her to send some financial support. She said no, saying that she as much as my life sucked, I can't just keep asking money from her, since she also needed it for college and rent, and she can try to help me with finding some options but to stop asking her. I got pretty desperate because I wanted to help my friend, so I pleaded with her. In the end, she said that this would be the last time that she'd do this and sent it. Today, I tried my online friend but I found out that I was blocked. I still had her Discord, so I made a new account and tried to text her. When I told her who I was, she told me to leave her alone. I was shocked, because she's normally very sweet and kind, so I asked what happened. She explained that her parents found out and got mad at her, and she already told on a few different occasions that she was uncomfortable with sending me money, especially since she barely knew me, and made her feel like she was a bad person for feeling that way. I tried to apologize and promised that I wouldn't do that again, but she didn't trust my word and blocked me. I felt awful and explained to my mother what happened. She told me that while what I intended to do was good, I can't just ask people to share their money with me. So I'm just wondering, AITA?",

        "selftext": "Involves myself (30F), my sister (twin) and our mom tangentially. Saturday evening was a common friend's engagement and only I attended, as sis lives out of country. My parents are away, time zones make our days/nights flipped (sis and I live in the same TZ). After the party around 1AM, I call the family chat and mom and sis picked up - I called to debrief on the engagement. Mom mentioned that our cousin was sick and that her dad went to a party alone (family birthday, which I knew about). She mentioned the party was the day before and I fixated on that - we had a quick back and forth about the date of the party - \u00a0this convo was 2 mins max, being very generous. \u00a0Sis apparently asked 4 times, what party? When mom and I finished the convo, I immediately answered sis and that's when I realized she'd disconnected. I thought maybe her phone died/Internet issue and continued talking to mom about the engagement because I figured I'd talk to my sis during the day, but wasn't sure when I'd speak to mom again. I even messaged right away asking what was wrong and why she wasn't on the call. But like I said, I thought it wasn't intentional and it's late, so whatever. I call my sis later on Sunday in the PM and ask what happened. Paraphrasing here, but the gist is, she said she didn't have to waste her time on the call when people are ignoring her and that it was extremely rude to not answer her when she asked four times and she was tired of being made insignificant. I got upset because if she had waited another minute, I would have answered. Sis said I should have answered immediately - that in the back and forth, one of us could have responded. I asked what was wrong with us finishing this minor thread before responding. There was a fight and we didn't talk. Today, I call sis again because I know she would be interested in the gossip and there were some things I wanted to run by her. However, I was still really frustrated by everything and after a little chit chat, I started the topic by mentioning along the lines that if my sist had been a little patient, I wouldn't have to go over this again. She blew up at me that she was tired of feeling insignificant and having her questions ignored. I responded again that 2 mins is not that long of a time and it just devolved again - I said something like it's a waste of time to repeat an hour long convo for this reason and she twisted it into I'm saying it's a waste of time talking to her. But then, I'm thinking, well, you thought it was a waste of your time to wait for 2 minutes, so why can't I think it's a waste to spend an hour rehashing everything? I get having to repeat convos/stories separately with my mom and my sis, but that's normally because one person wasn't available. But in this case, she was on the call and I feel this was a really petty reason to hang up. So, AITA because I did not immediately answer my sister's question instead of at the end of a conversation thread that lasted max 2 minutes?",

        "selftext": "Hi reddit! First of all, english is not my first language, so i apologize if something is not written correctly. So me (17 years old female) and my family (Dad [47 years old] and brother [10 years old]) went on a short trip of 1 night and 2 days last week. We went to a near town (aproximately 1 or 2 hours in car from where we live) located on the coast of a river. This is a very small town and it only has a few bars and restaurants to have lunch and dinner.  The thing is, we were at a bar, and there were two musicians playing guitar and percussion and singing, and they where playing a few requests from the crowd. At some point, my dad suggested to my brother that he could ask the musicians to play a song from a band that my brother loves. My brother didn't know if he wanted to tell the musicians to play a song, so my dad went to ask them. When he came back, my dad said (and i don't know if this is true or if my dad just said it to cheer my brother up) that the musicians told him that they didn't know the lyrics of the songs of this band, and that my brother would have to sing (my brother said that he would sing if he had to).  The thing is, this band is well known in the country where i live, however is more like a niche band, even though it is known. The thing is that musicians were playing (and the crowd were asking) for popular songs that everyone knows, so i thought that it could clash with the atmosphere. And my brother doesn't sing very well. So at some point i told my brother that no one wants to hear him sing, and i told him to not sing. My dad told me that i shouldn't say that, and after that my brother said that he was agree with me and that he doesn't sing very well.  He didn't sing after all, but i was wondering if i went to far when i told my brother that. It's just that it would have been so cringe if he had sung, but if that happened, i could have easily left the bar and go to the hotel (to 200 meters of the bar), because as i said, is a small town. My brother doesn't seem affected for what i said, but i thought that maybe i owe him an apology, AITA?   EDIT: Thanks for your comments! I've been reading every single one of them, i apreciate your opinions. Special thanks for those who shared their opinions respectfully.  I accept the judgment; i was an asshole in this situation, i said something hurtful and unnecesary that i should have kept to myself. I will apologize with my brother, and i will make breakfast for him tomorrow (i usually don't make him breakfast) with the foods that he likes as an apology. Again, thanks to everyone for sharing your thoughts here. That said, i will uninstall reddit for my own mental health. Some comments were really rude and i don't feel comfortable here anymore, so im going to prioritize my mental health, because i realized that im not prepared to dealing with some of the comments. I were nice to everyone who i answered, so i just will keep wishing everybody a lovely day \u2661 Again, thanks for everything.",

My cousins started leaving me out and i was low-key getting pissed off but i didn't say anything. We all went outside for a walk and when i came back into the driveway, my mom was there, smoking a cigarette. My mom noticed that something was wrong with me. She started interrogating me and trying to coax an answer out of me. I start crying out of distress because she kept berating me about something that didn't even happen. She leaves me alone for a bit and promises we'll leave as soon as she gets all the tupperware. I was in the car trying to calm myself. Once I do that, i go back inside expecting to see my mother ready to go. She explains that my Aunt was in the shower and wanted my mom to stay. I just said whatever and went back upstairs. Everyone around her was drunk and I was nervous at the thought my mom would also get drunk and try to drive me home. I also just really don't like drunk adults, they scare me (this also connects to the fact that last time everyone was drunk there was a fight and my uncle got hurt.) . I go upstairs for about another hour. I walk down the steps and peak my head over to peer at my mom who was sitting at the table. She was drinking out of a plastic cup and i felt my heart drop to my stomach. There was also a beer bottle sitting on the counter. She reassured me earlier that she was drinking Pepsi but my anxiety was taking no mercy at the time. I calmly walk upstairs to the bathroom and pace back and forth for a while. I pace up and down the steps, peering over once again. I just decide to go outside and talk my anger out. I go outside and grab a random box and bend it and kick it. It didn't help. I walk back in the house with everyone in the kitchen staring at me (probably because i was acting like a fucking lunatic). I go back into my cousins room to calm myself. after about 30 minutes i get impaitent and go to peer over the stairs again. they were all still drinking and my mom promised we'd leave 2 hours ago. I begin pacing again, scream into a pillow, and then i start feeling like i cant breath. so i run downstairs telling my mom i cant breath and she's acting like it's nothing (probably because i've embarrassed her enough). She then finally decides to go and i get yelled at from the moment we walked out the door to the minute we get home. I understand it was bratty and i still get her snarky comments about it from time to time. I think i'm the asshole. I just wanted to get this off my chest.",

I had to discover in the hard way that we have different standards as to what counts as an \u2018empty\u2019 toothpaste. This is what happened. I went to brush my teeth before bed, when I saw that the toothpaste is empty. Meaning, I couldn\u2019t squeeze out any more paste on my toothbrush (and I try pretty hard, I squeeze it and twist it and stuff). So, I just threw the pack out and went to sleep. I don\u2019t remember the chronology of events exactly but I must have emptied the trash before sleep as well, because the toothpaste was \u2018unsalvegable\u2019 according to my gf. Anyway, she burst into the room super angry, asking where the tooth paste went. I say it is in the trash because it was empty. She then calls me a \u2018cancer-whore\u2019 (it was in Dutch, but I understood). She says: \u201chow could you do that when we have no replacement?\u201d, \u201cI have to go to work tomorrow and I won\u2019t have clean teeth\u201d, etc. She works as a teacher and is conscious of her breath.  Here you need to know something about her - she likes to shop for necessities (rice, pasta, toothpaste, tomato cans, etc) in bulk when they\u2019re on sale, so we often have a stash of this stuff in the attic. It\u2019s a nice thing that she does that of course, but it has conditioned me to not check for these things because I just assume we have some in the attic. Anyway, I must have thrown it out, realized there is no replacement in the attic, and then shrugged and went to sleep. I\u2019m thinking: \u201cwhat can you do, right?\u201d During our argument, I find out that she would have cut the toothpaste tube in half with scissors and carved out any paste inside that way. To me, this is a different standard, and maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m a guy, but I don\u2019t see the big deal in brushing your teeth with just water for one evening and one morning.  She brings up that the same thing happened with her face wash a year ago. She had cut it in half before, and I threw it out because it looked broken to me. It had resulted in a similar fight back then. I guess I had forgotten about that, but I do try to pay attention to that kind of stuff. So, long story short, is she overreacting, or am I being ignorant of her needs?  ",

        "selftext": "This is a bit long but I basically have a very complicated relationship with my current partner. There has been lots of issues and for the longest time I\u2019ve said I will break up with him. We have been together for 4 years, so I have sort of created the problem I am in now. We spent Christmas and new years apart as I really don\u2019t get along with his family. Because of our jobs we are also currently living about 4 hours away so just this week I finally got to see him, I went over to his.  My parents had picked up on the time that my bf has spent here where I live, that I tend to pay for most things, and although we aim to do 50-50 split, for the most part he was earning about 2x than what I make and we still even split but I\u2019d end up paying for most things when we are out.  So my parents are concerned about this, I don\u2019t know what to do because I\u2019m very attached but here is where I might be the asshole: I showed my mom some jewellerymy partner gave me for Christmas. This was after about 3 years of hints as he never spent more than \u00a340 on gifts but spends lots on booze and again the gifts I gave him were far far more than what he spent on me.  My mom started making fun of the jewlerry, pointing out it was a fake. She also pointed out how my brother was about to get me the same jewellery over Christmas as it was on 50% sale. She also mentioned how much of a cheap ass he was, and how naive I was too take the jewellery. I didn\u2019t actually know if it was fake or not I was pleased he got me something other than candles. Even tho I agree a bit with her I snapped and told her she was a horrible person and that she had raised me to be like this so she should stop asking the world to treat me like a princess when she treats me like shit (her main argument is that I deserve more attention and thoughtfulness from a bf).The conversation obviously escalated and we both said some nasty things, I particularly said \u201cright cause your life is so hard we all have to be miserable with you?\u201d Bc my mom is going through a particularly rough job situation and I also said \u201cmaybe if you treated me better I would think I deserve more\u201d this is coming of the backend of my mom always been very a volatile parent. I also said I hated her and that she was just like her mom, and she was probably end up on her own as she pushes everyone away. I\u2019m not proud of what I said but writing it out so I\u2019m honest about the situation. She apologised profusely after it but I\u2019m very butt hurt about the whole situation.  TLDR: SO am I the asshole for going psycho on my mom for making fun of my boyfriend\u2019s present to me?",

The roommate in question , Maddy (20) is obsessed with my two pets, and moved in about 3 months ago. Before she moved in she loved my dog Theodore, and my cat, who was my sisters cat at the time, Dustin. I didn\u2019t mind all too much then because I didn\u2019t know her that well.  Over the past year as she\u2019s come to hang out with my sister, I\u2019ve gotten to know her, and dislike what I know. She is a sweet person, but she talks way to much for my comfort, and is very loud when she\u2019s talking. I am a true introvert and I just cannot talk to someone like that for more than a minute at a time. My sister told me she had a crush on me, which isn\u2019t reciprocated, and that didn\u2019t help with the talking and loving my animals.  To add to why I don\u2019t like her, ever since she moved in, she\u2019s been having problems paying rent, normal enough, but she also has her shirtless boyfriend over most days of the week and they love to make out in hallways and doorways just when I need to get through. Anyways, now that she lives here she loves to pickup my aloof cat, and loving dog and say stuff like \u201cmy beautiful kitty\u201d or \u201cmy handsome boy.\u201d I know it\u2019s genuinely sweet and they love all the attention they can get, but it just rubs me the wrong way every time I see or hear it.

Recently, in my history class, me and her got sat next to each other, which got us talking again. I knew that she had a pretty bad past, especially with lying and blackmailing people, so I was very careful on what I told her. She's pretty much unpredictable, and I thought she changed (being the naive person I am). I have a best friend who we'll call Barbara. Barbara and her boyfriend have been together for a few months now, and are in a healthy and happy relationship. Amelia knows that they're dating, but refuses to stop flirting with Barbara's boyfriend. She's always trying to get closer to him, always partnering up with him when we have an group assignment in history and giggling at every thing he says, even if it's not even funny. It's kinda like she's a pick me, but I don't wanna put it that way. Recently, Amelia began to flirt with Samuel, which I did not appreciate. I told her I didn't like how she always said that he looked good today, or how she messed with his hair even when he told her to stop. I know that they've been friends for a while, but I can't help but get jealous. It's like she's wants to frustrate me. Amelia expressed that she would stop; which I appreciated. But what she did was worse, and she began putting him down. She called him stupid, ugly, and always gagged everytime she was him. That annoyed me even more, because she could at least have some decent respect for him. I made a instagram post, talking about how Amelia made me feel and other things about her that annoy me. I guess my other friend showed her and told her, because the next day Amelia came up to me and started talking about how I was rude for saying all of that. I told her that I didn't appreciate her rude comments, and she said she understood, but literally as I was going to history, she was already talking in her annoying voice and saying Ewww! Get away from me! You're disgusting and look like a fucking pig. I got really mad at her, and pulled her aside, and started berating her about what she said and how she promised she would stop. She simply rolled her eyes, and mumbled a small apology before going back to our friends and giggling with them. So AITA?",

Last year I hit .332 with 5 HR\u2019s and 22 XBH\u2019s and a .993 fielding pct, I was ranked as the second best prospect in the state last year(the one above me is a senior who graduated last year)  I work really hard, I try to train at least 3-4 times a day wake up at like 5 lift for 45 minutes to an hour, ( I have weights  in the garage), leave for school at 7:15, during lunch drive home eat something then hit off a tee and do hitting drills (I get an hour for lunch and have a free block right after lunch so I have about 2 hours) after school practice or in the offseason go to the gym, come home eat dinner, do my homework make sure I\u2019m caught up on my schoolwork and go outside and hit off a tee and do more hitting drills for at least 90 minutes. I have a strict nutrition plan I follow, I normally do 2 cheat days a month and 1 rest day a week (I also stretch and ice my muscles before I go to sleep I know recovery is important) I want to play in college and in the mlb so I work hard towards that goal and try to get a little bit better everyday and stay disciplined eat right, train hard everyday even when I don\u2019t want to, and Just stay laser focused on that goal and block out all distractions. Yesterday was my sister\u2019s(14F) birthday my family went  out to dinner, I didn\u2019t go, my teammates were going to a batting cage (we go every Saturday) and I had to go to that, to me missing practice or work outs isn\u2019t an option getting better everyday is what\u2019s most important, the way I see it is this: I have one goal be the best baseball player I can possibly be, anything outside that lane I don\u2019t have time for, baseball for me is the most important thing. When I told my parents I couldn\u2019t go and I had practice they said I could miss one practice and I said I can\u2019t. Slacking and missing practice isn\u2019t an option until I\u2019m the best plain and simple. Last night I went to the facility worked for a few hours and stayed after and got extra work in and went home, and my parents were upset saying I could have missed 1 practice for a special occasion, I don\u2019t think so I\u2019m not the best so that means there are no off days there is no missing practice I\u2019m not injured, I\u2019m not sick so there\u2019s no reason not to go it\u2019s not that I don\u2019t care about my family or anything but I\u2019ve got a goal I\u2019ve got a dream and that comes first no matter what.

        "selftext": "Hi,Single mom here with two kids and an on again and off partner. He is currently unemployed and the primary caretaker of our children while I work an average of 10-12 hours a day. All bills are on me and most days I\u2019m overwhelmed but so is he with two rambunctious children. In our old home he had a job but never contributed to bills and instead did fun things with the kids like pay for museum tickets and the zoo etc so I didn\u2019t mind. This month things are really tight, our eldest needed braces (she\u2019s under 10 y/o) and that was an unexpected expense. Anyway, when we moved into the house- the old tenants left a tv mount above the fireplace. The previous owner told us that it\u2019s difficult to remove because this is an old house with sensitive walls. After living here for about a month and a half my partner (without consulting me) decides to take down the wall mount. Ok- no problem\u2026 but he tells me he won\u2019t fill in the massive holes tonight. I ask when then? He storms off and doesn\u2019t say a thing. I already feel bamboozled with this house, so many things have broken and I\u2019ve been paying for them to be replaced or repaired. To hear, that a perfectly fine mount was removed for absolutely no reason is gut wrenching, especially after the repair costs I\u2019ve had to endure. Now I\u2019ve hired a task rabbit who will arrive in a few days to fill/sand/and paint this atrocious hole situation.  my partner is mad that I am paying for this. The last project at the previous house included building a cat corridor and dragging giant pieces of wood across my laundry room walls and never fixing it.  I know financially it isn\u2019t the best time to pay for ANOTHER repair so I feel like an asshole, however, I don\u2019t think I should feel that way because I was so excited for this home and it\u2019s already been a pain without my partners shenanigans. tldr; partner put holes in the walls by removing the TV mount without discussion and is mad that I\u2019m paying for the repair because \u201che\u2019ll get around to fixing it\u201d am I the asshole?   Am I the asshole for paying a handyman?",

        "selftext": "My boyfriend and I have been dating for a few months now, and things are going really well. We share a lot of common interests, and even when we differ, we enjoy learning from each other. We\u2019ve also set some boundaries, like keeping PDA to just holding hands and not bringing up each other\u2019s pasts unless it\u2019s mentioned first by said party. However, there's one small thing that really bothers me, even though it\u2019s not really that big of a deal. I get really anxious about phone calls. Whenever my phone rings, I instantly think there\u2019s something urgent or serious going on. I\u2019ve talked to my boyfriend about it, and while he\u2019s the opposite and loves calling people (since he thinks it\u2019s quicker and more personal than texting), I\u2019ve asked him to text me before calling if it\u2019s just for a casual conversation. This way, I can relax, knowing it\u2019s not an emergency, and decide if I\u2019m available to talk. It\u2019s also helpful because if I\u2019m in the middle of something, I can either finish what I\u2019m doing or let him know I\u2019ll call him back later. When he calls without texting first, I get stressed, and I don\u2019t like letting it go to voicemail because I worry something\u2019s wrong. And thus, no matter what I\u2019m doing, I will always stop everything to answer a call. A quick text helps me calm down. And don\u2019t get me wrong\u2026 I\u2019d love to hear him on the phone. Just, a text first would be nice. Recently, he called me without texting first, but it was for an emergency, so I didn\u2019t mind. However, since then, he\u2019s continued calling without texting, and while he apologizes when it happens, it still bothers me. I don\u2019t want to say anything because he\u2019s still dealing with said emergency that happened earlier, but I\u2019m starting to feel upset. I\u2019m unsure if I should just let it go since 1) its not a big deal, and 2) it\u2019s part of his character to call instead of text, or if I should ask him to change this for me. It\u2019s a small thing, but it\u2019s starting to weigh on me a bit. AITA?",

But her mother had to go to another town because of a family emergency and didn\u2019t want us home alone. So we went to another friend\u2019s house and planned for her mom to pick us up in the morning to go back to the FIRST house. I sleep in bc Im not expecting to get pick up until Sunday. Well I get woken up to them saying my mom called and I had to go, and she was at the house we weren\u2019t anymore. i ended up calling her to let her know Im at others friend house. So I get picked up and she tells me as soon as I get in the car that since I \u201clied\u201d about where I was, I won\u2019t be having no more sleepovers for weeks. In the car I tried to explain what happened but she cut me off saying how she didn\u2019t care about my why. Like she has this story in her head and wants to keep it like that.  So I wait until the next day and I asked her if I can go back over and DONT have to spend the night and she said no bc I wasn\u2019t where I was supposed to be and I should have let her know I was moving from one place to the other. I told her I understand but it slipped my mind and she wasnt even supposed to pick me up to even be so upset about the situation. And she was just like \u201cwell ima do what ima do and see look, u wasn\u2019t where you was supposed to be\u201d like shes always tryna caught me being bad. I kept telling her that texting her slipped my mind cus I was with friends and I was safe and she had my snap location so I didn\u2019t think it was the biggest deal in the world and there were adult/parents there but she didn\u2019t care and just kept saying she doesn\u2019t care about the why and that I should have Jst let her know.  I told her it\u2019s unfair cause she\u2019s making it seem intentional when everything Jst sorta happened and she again said she didn\u2019t care if it was or wasn\u2019t intentional i tell should have \u201ctold her I was moving\u201d and I told her I\u2019ll do better next time and it\u2019s was jst a mistake and she said ima Jst have to \u201ctake my L\u201d and sit in my decision BUT IT WASNT MY DECISION AND SHES MAKING IT SEEM LIKE ITS MY FAULT WHEN SHE LITERALLY HAS MY LOCATION ON SNAP! Everyone else can make a mistake but as soon as I make one it\u2019s so horrible. And she said I won\u2019t be able to go out or have anymore sleepovers for WEEKS?! I feel like the punishment is unfair especially this being the FIRST time it happened. And it was never that deep. ",

Three of those children (30m, 28f, 27m) have either very limited contact with their mother or refuse to have contact at all. She thinks they are being selfish and ungrateful, but they all have valid reasons for not being in contact. Her daughter (let's call her Lily) now has a young child of her own and, thanks to her unwanted advances from her former housemate, she's in emergency accommodation while she waits for social housing. She has been in emergency accommodation since before Christmas.  My husband (42m) and I offered her, and her child, the use of our spare room until she gets on her feet, but she declined it because it would lower her chances of being provided her own place. The problem is that she doesn't have her own car. We have lent her my husband's car and have promised her that we would help her get a car and that we would initially pay for it, but that she would have to work off her debt by doing some cleaning and maintenance for us, and she has happily agreed.  This whole time, her mother, Jenny has shown little interest in her daughter. They don't have the best relationship as it is, and Lily feels constantly let down by Jenny. With permission from Lily, I have been updating Jenny on the situation, which has led to Jenny complaining that she only hears about Lily's situation from me. Today I  asked her if she'd be willing to spend some of her savings (that she told me about) to help get Lily a car. She was angry with me for making that suggestion while not telling Lily that she had to start spending time with Jenny.  Jenny also said that she'd been asked to do this by another sister and that she was looking for cars as we speak despite not being aware of the requirements of a car. Apparently, she wants to tell Lily  that if she wants money for a car then Lily has to let Jenny  have access to the grandchild.  Lily has not once asked Jenny for help, it is all coming from me. I told Jenny that HER daughter was HER responsibility, not mine, and that she needed to reach out and help her.  Here's where I might be TA, I was a little rude in our conversation which was over text message. I stand by what I wrote (that she had to step up and provide for her adult child), but I wasn't very kind and I let my growing frustration bubble over and it showed in the texts.  Tl;Dr: niece (and niece's child) is stranded in emergency accommodation, I told her mother to step up and provide assistance. My husband and I are planning to sell a car to her for much less than it's worth and asked her mother to contribute to the car. I was a little rude when I asked her mother to help. AITA?",

        "selftext": "So I had made plans for a football match with one of my friends, some people he wanted to bring along and my girlfriend. I bought the tickets and the seats for myself,my girlfriend and my friend. Today, match-day, I get a text from my friend (who is also our driver for today) saying that he doesn't think he will come to the match, long story short he isn't getting the desirable result in his college grades and he and his parents got in an argument, basically he canceled saying that he has gone out a lot these past few days and exams are coming up. At first I tried to support him telling him that everyone is different and it's okay if he's a bit behind, to not be hard on himself since I felt he was guilt-tripping himself. And I tried to persuade him saying that a few hours won't change anything and that it's wrong to limit yourself and deprive yourself of fun and free time just because you feel bad about not studying, it's Sunday night, you can study another day, or before the match. Basically canceling now won't solve the problem, nor make it better. You can both go out now and fix your studying schedule, it doesn't have to be either/or. We got nowhere and I got kind of mad at him, I told him he is fucking me, because I've been working all week and I haven't gone out at all, I'm also studying in college at the same time, and I've been planning this whole week for this Sunday, and I felt like I was getting punished for his bad habits, and I felt disrespected by him for not respecting my time and the fact that we had planned something mutually and he canceled the same day, a few hours before. He got defensive after that and started telling me that college is more important(than the fact that he canceled) and that he is really behind, and it's none of my business, he is not coming and that's final. AITA? Because I did feel bad about lashing out at him but at the same time I've worked all week, I'm doing okay at college, and this is the only night out I'll have all week, I felt that it's irresponsible from him to cancel on me and I felt like I was getting punished for being good at keeping my schedule. I'll end up going with my girlfriend, the two of us, so it's not all bad, but i felt if didn't make it a big deal he would do it again.",

        "selftext": "I (19M) recently broke up with my now-ex (also 19M). Let\u2019s call him Del. For added context, we dated while we were roommates. I know, not my brightest idea. We did not date for very long. We talked for about a month before making it official, were boyfriends for a month, then Del broke up with me on New Year\u2019s. My other roommate (20M), let\u2019s call him Jay, had some opinions about our relationship from the beginning. It was mostly that he was uncomfortable with living with a couple. I will admit, the first week, we would often cuddle on the couch, but we ended up moving to Del\u2019s room because Del confronted our other roommates about how they really felt. From then on, we would generally only do \u201ccouple things\u201d in each other\u2019s rooms. There would still be the occasional flirting and hugging outside of our rooms, however. After we broke up, I confided in Jay because I still saw him as a friend. He said that he felt bad but was also glad we broke up. Fast forward to about 2 weeks later, me and Jay went out to lunch with another friend and my breakup became the topic of the conversation. The other friend was the one who brought it up. Again, Jay said he was glad we broke up. I didn\u2019t say anything at the table because I was super flustered hearing that again. I texted Jay later that night after cooling down. I texted the following: \u201ccan you tell me what you meant by u guys are glad we broke up cuz its more chill now? im not trying to start shit im just needing some type of clarity cuz if im being honest that genuinely felt like a fucked up thing to say\u201d Jay apologized, but it was more of a \u201csorry you felt that way\u201d apology. He also said he was \u201cjust being real.\u201d  Then, I also told Jay that it wasn\u2019t good that he tried to \u201cspare our feelings\u201d by not telling us about how he really felt while me and Del were dating and that what he said shouldn\u2019t have come up at the table in public with another friend. Jay said he didn\u2019t spare anyone\u2019s feelings and just wanted to avoid drama and that his comment was completely appropriate because the conversation was about the breakup. Am I the asshole?",

        "selftext": "So I (18m) work about an hour from my sisters (21f) college and I don\u2019t really have many friends in my area so I like to go line dancing and to other social events with my sister and her friends. Often after these events it\u2019s late at night and I don\u2019t want to drive an hour to go home so I stay at her apartment. sometimes me and my sister have plans the next day so it saves money, time, energy, etc. The problem is she has two roommates; Jane and Sally.  Recently Jane has had some problems with me staying over on the couch. She says that she\u2019ll have to walk past me to get to the bathroom in the middle of the night and doesn\u2019t want to have to deal with a man in the house. Sally hasn\u2019t said anything on the issue and it\u2019s mainly Jane that has the problem. Jane has said that it\u2019s okay for me to stay the night if I give a week advance notice and I can only stay once every other week. also my sister has to sleep on the couch and I stay in my sisters bedroom so that Jane doesn\u2019t expose herself to me on her late night bathroom trips. There are a few other things to note: me and my sister are step siblings (so it would be a little weird to share a room) everyone involved is Christian and a boy staying over is a little awkward already. And lastly Jane has a boyfriend Dave who often comes over and stays late into the night. I should also include that Dave is a leader of a Christian frat where it is strictly forbidden to stay the night with girls, however they have a 2am curfew and he leaves  before that. (But once while I stayed on the couch he stayed until the morning, this was relayed to one of his leaders and he got into some trouble for it) I stayed last Friday when nobody was there but me and my sister and I want to go line dancing again on Thursday but I\u2019m not a big fan of driving for an hour at 1am because Jane doesn\u2019t want me to stay over.

They got married in a different country (17+ hour long flights to that country from where I live) and I would have to take 1-2 weeks off school to attend. I didn't want to fall behind and have my grades suffer since good grades are important for getting into a good college and good graduate school. My cousins also couldn't have their wedding during a holiday break, like Thanksgiving or Christmas.  So I ended up skipping both my cousins' weddings.  I finally had the chance to meet my aunt and uncle (my cousins' parents) as they were visiting. My uncle said he was disappointed and upset that I couldn't even take one week off school/college to attend his daughters' weddings. I, in a joking manner, responded that if my cousins ever got divorced, I'd gladly attend their second wedding.  (For context, I've graduated and am working for a company that offers paid vacation days. I could use those vacation days to attend a major family event like a wedding.)  My uncle seemed even more upset when I said that. I tried to console him. I told him it was a joke and that I hoped for nothing but the best for my cousins and their spouses.

        "selftext": "My bf and I were renting a studio flat together for about a year, and I was the one paying all of the rent this entire time. It started with around $360 per month, and later went up to $400, plus the water and electricity bills (around $10-15). Over the last months, he did pay for the water and electricity bills, but that was it.I have the privilege of my mother helping me out financially, and I also know that my bf doesn't earn very much, so I never complained about this rent situation. Also, while I paid for the flat, he paid for almost all of our groceries and daily expenses, so in the end our monthly spendings felt balanced.I never ONCE said anything about him not paying the rent. Not ONCE did I even mention it, because I was perfectly okay with the situation. I know my mother didn't like it very much that we weren't splitting the rent equally, but there's her opinion, and there's my opinion, and I personally NEVER did or said anything to make him feel guilty or unwelcome in this flat.But about a month ago I found myself in a tight spot. I quit my job in hopes of getting a better paying one, but it didn't work out, so I had to shrink my expenses, while I was looking for a new job. For the first time in our relationship, I asked my bf for help with the rent. I said, that he could give me $50, he could give me $10, any amount, it doesn't matter, because all of it would be incredibly helpful. I said, that he was in no way obligated to give me anything at all, if he felt like he wasn't in the place to do that at the moment. I said that if not, I could absolutely continue paying the whole price by myself, and it would not be a problem.He did give me $50.And two or three days later, while both of us were at home, my mother called me. Among other things, she asked whether my bf was helping me pay the rent this month. I answered, in a perfectly calm tone, with no underlying emotion whatsoever, that he gave me $50. And that was the end of that conversation.But since my bf was home too, he heard everything. And he didn't bring it up at first, but later when he left for work, he texted me that he would be moving out to live with his mother. He said that he didn't have enough money to start splitting the rent with me, but because of that fucking phone conversation he now felt too guilty for not paying, to continue living with me.Yes, I did tell him it was bullshit, that I didn't blame him for anything, and that I would really want him to stay, but he didn't listen.We keep in touch and we technically haven't broken up. I miss him so fucking much, and I love him more than anything in the world, and I never cared about the damn rent.I've been trying to convince him to come back since then, but so far he's not budging. I can't stop blaming myself for having that phone conversation, and for unintentionally shaming him. I feel like the absolute shittiest person in the world, which destroyed my own happiness :)",

        "selftext": "Today, after going to the gym, my parents and I had an appointment with a math tutor to see if I was eligible and what I could gain. My grades aren't awful (B\u2019s-C\u2019s), but I don\u2019t understand a lot of the fundamentals and I do terribly on tests. I\u2019m in geometry, which is normal for my age.  My dad (58M) dropped me off at the appointment, and after I finished a test to assess my math skills, I was bored and decided to go get food. I couldn\u2019t find a place to sit, so I texted my mom (51F)to complain a bit, mostly just because I wanted to talk to her. When my parents came back, I called my dad to find him, and when I finally did, I was upset because he told me there *was* seating in Fry\u2019s (my mom must\u2019ve told him about the texts). I had just walked around for 10 minutes trying to find a seat, so I didn\u2019t believe him and was frustrated. We started arguing, and my mom shut it down saying, Why are we arguing over bullshit? I felt embarrassed because there were little kids around, and I was still upset. After we met with the tutor inside and we were walking out I told them the tutoring might not work (I know, I was being stupid) On the drive home, I was venting to my mom (I usually talk to her about my dad), but then she started screaming at me. She called me a bunch of names cunt,bitch,disgusting and a narcissist and ungrateful for everything they do for me. I tried to explain that I was just nervous about the tutoring situation, but she kept berating me. She complained about being busy, driving me around for things like swimming practice, a sport I don\u2019t enjoy or want to do. I find it hard to feel sorry for her when a lot of the stress is self-inflicted. She is also choosing to have two jobs and keeps saying she has no time for herself (my dad makes enough for my family to live comfortably and her income is not much, but we respect it because she \u201clikes to be busy\u201d she says) At one point, I snapped and called her childish and narcissistic, and she flipped out even more. When we got home, I felt a bit bad, so I apologized to my dad and thanked him for signing me up for tutoring, even though he reassured me that he wasn\u2019t upset. Now I\u2019m feeling confused. I\u2019ve forgiven my mom for everything in the past, but it feels like she really hates me, and I don\u2019t know why. I\u2019m wondering if I was justified in calling her childish and narcissistic, or if I should have just let it go and kept my mouth shut.  AITA?",

I wanted him to go to individual therapy, but he said I have issues too but I can\u2019t afford therapy for myself, which is why we\u2019re in couples. I don\u2019t like it only because I feel like we\u2019d be better if we individually got therapy but he\u2019s insisting couples and he\u2019s paying for it. That\u2019s a little background, here\u2019s the issue: This morning I was trying to do my school work as quietly as possible to not disturb him- let\u2019s call him C for now- and all of a sudden C yelled at me \u201cHow\u2019s laundry coming up?\u201d Now I say \u201cyell\u201d loosely, it was mostly his tone that caught me off guard. I thought at first he was joking around and I replied \u201cfine, how\u2019s the stove coming?\u201d Cause C hasn\u2019t cleaned the stove in a month and a half and I hadn\u2019t put up my laundry from last night so I thought we were being funny. We weren\u2019t. He started saying \u201cit\u2019ll get done when I f*cking get up, get in here and do your laundry else it\u2019ll be in the basket for 17 f*cking days.\u201d I was at this point really upset but part of couples therapy is not saying anything mean to each other and i had nothing nice to say so I started doing laundry in the room, on the bed. Thinking C was now wide awake and gonna get up, i just threw shirts at the end of the bed by his foot just to get started, and C immediately got upset again and said \u201cThe f*ck are you doing? Obviously you\u2019re gonna wake me up if you do laundry on top of me go do it in the living room we have a couch.\u201d And waved me off.  3 hours went by and C finally got up and started asking why I did that, why I was doing an idiot move, if it was me trying to force him up or say \u201cf*ck you\u201d to him and I was already upset cause the way he talked to me previously made me feel like an idiot and all these emotions bubbled over and I screamed at him \u201cI wasn\u2019t trying to do anything I was just trying to do the laundry like you said! I don\u2019t care!\u201d  C then got mad and told me to go into another room for ten minutes to calm down and I\u2019ve been in this room crying hysterically because I just feel like I\u2019m going crazy, am I the asshole here? Am I really just so deranged I don\u2019t see what I did wrong? Please give honest answers I just really need someone outside of this to tell me what I did or didn\u2019t do. ",

When she went to book us massages, the spa mentioned that they only service 18 and older fur full body massages. So aunt booked me a manicure, pedicure, and facial instead, while she and my mom got to have the whole works with a nice full body massage. Here\u2019s the thing, I\u2019ve had plenty of manicures and pedicures so getting them doesn\u2019t really feel very \u2018fancy spa like\u2019 or pampering. I asked my sing if she could just tell them I\u2019m 18 (since I have always been told I look a few years older) but she wouldn\u2019t.  We get to the spa and they immediately take my mom and aunt back but I had to wait almost an hour for my facial masseuse to come get me. The lady kind of rushed it, and was in a hurry to get me out of the room when she was done. The mani and pedi was nothing different from your typical nail salon visit. I then had to wait almost an hour afterward in the lobby for my mom and aunt bc they wanted to go swimming in the whirlpool and hot tubs. We went to lunch nearby afterward and my mom asked me why I was so grumpy and I said that no worries I wasn\u2019t. She then kept prying so I then broke it to her that it wasn\u2019t fair I didn\u2019t get nearly the same luxurious treatments they were bragging about on the way to lunch, just because I\u2019m younger. The mani and pedi didn\u2019t feel anything more luxurious than going to a nail salon. It also wasn\u2019t fair I had to wait over an hour in the lobby while they got to enjoy the amenities without inviting me down. My mom angrily snapped that I\u2019m also the only one if the three who doesn\u2019t work a full time job nor did I pay for any of it, and that one day when I start working and can afford it, then I can enjoy a nice treatment. She then revealed that my pedicure was $80, which I think is steep bc it was no better than a nail salon visit. My aunt didn\u2019t say anything, but WITA here? ",

We have been dating for 1 year but until today I have NOT met his 28 year old only daughter. She has been married for 4 years now and she has a 1 year old boy. It is still uncertain as to why she has not visited or responds to my boyfriend's texts or anyone on his side of the family. He believes it is because he wants to sell the house he still owns with his ex. My boyfriend's daughter, her husband and their son and my boyfriend's ex still live in that house. They were given the option to buy him out but they all want the house to be sold to them to what it was worth back on 2013. My boyfriend he just wants a fresh start.  So last year back on November my boyfriend and I we were supposed to travel along with another couple to Cancun. My boyfriend does not have the hours and flexibility to take vacations as us 3 have. He asked to postpone the trip to March so we agreed. A few days ago while attempting to schedule the trip he told me he was not ready financially and time wise and he couldn't make the month of March either. I was upset but did not say anything. So about 1 or 2 days after this he confessed how much he misses his daughter and grandson and continued to tell me he can not believe how she takes up to 1 week to answer his texts. We continued the conversation but changed the subject a little and he told me that he still pays for his ex's car insurance (which is understandable specially since divorce it's not finalized) and for their daughter's. I WAS LIVID! I was like: Who? your daughter that is married?? (I was being sarcastic as they only have her) I asked why and he said because that is her daughter and was going to continue helping her. He continued saying he only pays $100 a month for her insurance and he spends that and more every time him and I go out to eat. My boyfriend and I we NEVER talk about money and where our money goes but I have a career where I make my own money and just about 5 months ago I bought a condo with no one's help so no, I am not after his money. We do not live together (he lives with his parents) but he does buy groceries for my house here and there but does not pay for any of my bills and NEVER gives me cash nor I expect it. He continued saying that he could not believe I was talking about his daughter and I responded that I could not believe either that after how she treats him he is doing this so what about her good for nothing husband?? Is this the reason why we are not traveling on March? After my friends and I bend backwards to accommodate him? He continued saying that he confides me his issues so I can listen but not judge So AITA? I was and I'm still livid..... ",

And she blasted it. Like, the system was at 100(max) and it was so loud I literally almost threw up, which sounds weird, but it happened. Then after I kept turning it down to 0 and she turned it back up, she disconnected it and started playing loud music from her music player upstairs. AITA for refusing to go upstairs?",

        "selftext": "My partner and I recently started to live together at his place. He's been very accommodating and helped me feel at home ever since I moved in. There's one thing I feel we disagree on, and that's having company over every weekend.  When he was living alone he had a couple of good friends come over for drinks (nothing fancy, just catching up over a couple of beers) on a weekly basis, and he's the personification of my house is your house. They would raid the fridge, plop themselves on the couch and stay over well after midnight. They live with their parents and just like to be out of the house with every opportunity. Not an issue for me, but it's the main reason they like to come over instead of inviting us over to their place. I'm a very private person, I enjoy my own space and quiet time to decompress and relax on weekends. While I tried to also be accommodating and connect with his friends, the idea of having company and not being able to basically rot on the couch with just my partner is exhausting.  I talked to him about it and he said ok, we'll have them over when you feel like it. Thing is, I'm starting to never feel like it, it's almost a chore to me, I simply don't like people in my space. At the same time, I feel guilty about telling my partner not to have his friends over and socializing, as he's a lot more of a people person than I am.  Here's where I might be the asshole: my partner asked me to decide when to have them over because he doesn't want to impose and he wants me to be comfortable with it, so I texted them in advance and let them know we'd be having an early evening, instead of the usual. Once they left, my partner says he really enjoys their normal hangouts, and I was being antisocial for cutting it short.  We had a conversation about having people over every Saturday, and I suggested we compromise and maybe plan an evening out, have a few drinks and go back to our usual routine, at home. Or something along the lines of having them over once a month, instead of weekly. I don't want to deny my partner his need to be social and hangout with his friends, but since I'm now also living in the house, there needs to be some boundaries, and as much as I like his friends, I'm not always in the mood to share my space and not have  my quiet time for the sake of his bachelor days.",

        "selftext": "Hey Redditers! So I have a bit of an issue. Background info: me and a group of my friends are going skiing next week, taking a train up and back. There will be 11 (7 boys 4 girls) of us going up, with no parents skiing directly with us (we're all 13-14). Basically, while talking with my other friends a bit ago I came up with an amazing idea, the big group of skiers that I'm going up with soon should all wear pink tutus! It would be a great way to spot each other on the mountain that a lot of us haven't skied a lot , so we don't get lost. Also, I just thought it would be super fun and funny. Now most of us are on board with my fantabulous idea, except too boys. Let's call them Ryan and Josh. Ryan dosnt want to wear a tutu because his dad will think he's gay now I know his dad, since I was little, a cool dude really. All I can say is his dad probably wears tutus in his free time. Josh doesn't want to wear a tutu because it will mess up his confidence while skiing, and he'll look dumb and gay. Now, tbh we're all gonna mess up while skiing, and we're all friends so it doesn't matter. Also what about wearing a tutu makes you gay, and why is that a bad thing. I get that they're insecure middle school boys, but we're all friends. I have made jokes too about canceling their train ticket or pushing them off the chairlift if they don't wear one of our beautiful pink tutus (that another friend bought). They are starting to get mad. Even though they are getting mad, I can't help keep bringing up their lack of tutu enthusiasm. What should I do to get them to wear a tutu, or should I let them do their own thing. So AITA for constantly bringing up their no-go attitude for wearing tutus while skiing, because I'm being to pushy?  So uhm just to clear something up, it's a joke, sorry if my writing skills suck. We all want to wear tutus for fun, I obviously can't make the two that don't want to wear them, and wouldn't force them to wear them if they were seriously uncomfortable about it. Yea uhm my writing skills suck but I swear my intentions aren't bad haha, I'm just trying to convince some friends by writing a Reddit story haha Also it's not just me who want them to wear a tutu, everyone else does too.

        "selftext": "Alright, Reddit, I really need your input because I\u2019m seriously starting to lose it. I (25 M) am a graduate student in CompSci in Florida, living with my two boyfriends, one is 25 and the other is 23. We\u2019re all just barely scraping by. We all graduated undergrad in CompSci, and now we\u2019re doing our Masters, hoping that maybe\u2014just maybe\u2014things will get better. But here\u2019s the thing: the job market for CompSci is absolutely DEAD. I\u2019ve applied everywhere\u2014Starbucks, Chick-Fil-A, McDonald\u2019s, Walmart, Publix\u2014hell, I\u2019ve even tried random fast food chains and retail jobs\u2014and nothing. No openings. I\u2019m so broke, I\u2019m working DoorDash, Uber, Lyft, and doing random odd jobs just to pay bills and buy food. To make matters worse, we\u2019re stuck with this shitty condo we bought five years ago when we thought life would be easier (spoiler alert: it\u2019s not). Now, we\u2019re drowning in mortgage payments, so we decided to rent out our 3-bedroom, 1-bath condo for a decent price, hoping to get some help covering the bills. Me and my boyfriends are planning to move in with the 23-year-old\u2019s parents, and we\u2019re going to share one room to save money (because who wouldn\u2019t want to live like that?). So, these three college students came by for a tour. They barely showed any interest in the place, which was whatever, but then as they left, they just stood outside and started talking about how awful the place was. Like, LOUDLY. They could\u2019ve been a little more discreet, but nope, they just tore into it. And you know what? That was the final straw for me. I\u2019ve been struggling, stressed to the max, just trying to get through school, hoping that maybe\u2014just maybe\u2014I\u2019ll be able to land a job someday (but with how things are going, who the hell knows?). I\u2019m sick of it. So I walked outside and, yes, I fucking screamed at them about how hard it is to be a college student in this economy, especially a CompSci major with no job prospects. I ranted about how I\u2019ve applied to every damn job and can\u2019t get hired anywhere, how I\u2019m doing everything I can just to survive, and how even with a Masters, I don\u2019t know if anything will actually change. I may have used some\u2026 colorful language. Now I\u2019ve got a warning from my condo\u2019s HOA, saying if I do something like that again, I\u2019ll get a $450 fine. Seriously. They want me to just sit back and take it, while I\u2019m drowning in debt and frustration? I\u2019m just tired of pretending everything\u2019s fine when it\u2019s not. So, AITA for losing it and screaming at them? I get that I shouldn\u2019t have gone off like that, but can you blame me? Everything feels like it\u2019s falling apart, and I\u2019m just trying to survive.",

I happily accepted and asked if I could pay him back in installments, which he agreed to, and we had a great time. When the dodgers won the championship, he then invited me to the Championship celebration for his face value and this, being much cheaper, I paid him for immediately. Once again, we had a great time, however, after the celebration we both noticed that the plastic beer cups they gave out after the game were pretty great memorabilia and I saw one near me that I grabbed with the intention of washing it and using it at home. He looked around and didn\u2019t see another and asked me if he could have the one I grabbed. I laughed and said \u201cno, this is mine.\u201d He appeared frustrated, but I then went to search for a second cup for him. In the process of searching, we got separated and we left without the chance to say goodbye.  We live in different parts of the state and don\u2019t talk too often, but a month and a half later he calls me and says he wants to express some resentment he has with me for my behavior. He expresses that he believes I should have happily given him the cup given that he got me the face value tickets to both events when he could have easily made money by selling the tickets on the second market and instead he was kind enough to sell them to me. He was also very turned off by my reaction having laughed at the idea of giving him the cup saying that he felt I was disrespectful. I apologized and said that I intended no disrespect, but also said that I definitely didn\u2019t owe him the cup as I paid the same amount he did and it was his choice to sell me the tickets and not take the profit. He disagreed and we moved on after I offered him the cup because in all honesty, it\u2019s a $5 cup and not that important to me. He declined it saying it\u2019s the principle of the matter. Now I am sitting here feeling frustrated because this all feels like such a silly thing to hold a resentment over. The fact that he had this resentment towards me for a month and a half and felt the need to talk about it so long after the fact just feels petty and it\u2019s hard for me to take seriously.  So AITA for finding this whole situation ridiculous and being frustrated this he feels so easily disrespected over such minor grievances? Also, did I owe him the cup? Edit: I do want to say that I was incredibly grateful to my friend for everything. I paid for parking which was $50. I thanked him profusely. I posted pictures on instagram of us together where I expressed my gratitude, etc. There is an assumption being made that I wasn\u2019t grateful and I was, I just didn\u2019t respond with that for the cup instance. Idk if that makes a difference, but there you go!",

        "selftext": "I (26M) was kicked out of my apartment building about a month and a half ago due to my landlord who has always used any small thing I did to threaten that they would kick me out on a moment\u2019s notice. I ticked him off a little too much for \u201cnot respecting the other people in the building\u201d and I was kicked out I had three days to clear everything out. I had also just lost my job working at the local grocery store, so I had no home and no job, just an internship at a real estate agency which I was only getting $10 an hour from; I was struggling. Luckily, one of my friends (27M) who I have known since high school offered to let me stay in their house while I found a place to live and a new job. Once, I was moved in, he said that it was nice to have someone to make him less lonely. After about two weeks of living together he started repeatedly asking if I had found any job listings and saying he found one that I would like. I had found a few places on my own too but honestly there wasn\u2019t anywhere for me that fit what I needed, good money, easy and chill, low hours, and close to my living space. And then another week went by, and he started bugging me about finding a place to live, claiming he found some great places, but honestly, I like living with him, it\u2019s nice and he has a great house. I was trying to hint to him that we could just live together, but he wasn\u2019t getting it. He started calling me a little kid because I \u201cwasn\u2019t doing anything ever and just wasting the little money [I] had.\u201d He was getting annoying, I was just trying to make more friends, so I was going to parties and bars, hanging out with people. When I finally got the courage to ask him about living together, he got all defensive and asked about if this was the plan all along, take advantage of him for a living space that I don\u2019t even pay for. I said I could, but he didn\u2019t believe me, he claimed that it was too expensive for someone living on $10 an hour and not rushing to get a job, he complained about how he was just taking care of me. I got annoyed and asked why he decided to be so mean about this and just said I couldn\u2019t live with him. I brought up that he said he enjoyed it and that he \u201clove[s]\u201d having someone to live with, I couldn\u2019t understand how he was mad. For the last week we have been ignoring each other sometimes he would tell me to \u201cfind a job for god\u2019s sake!\u201d he has become so mean, I don\u2019t know what to do. AITA?",

        "selftext": "I have a group of lady friends who plan regular get togethers. Most of us are connected through Carla (not her real name) who is our unofficial matriarch. She plans the events, they are usually at her house and when we do trips out of town, she pays for the Airbnb on her card and we pay her our portion. The most recent upcoming trip has an indoor pool. We go do these parties and pretty much let loose. There\u2019s drinking, and shenanigans. We\u2019re silly af.  To be clear we\u2019re old ladies. Most of us are moms and about half of us are grandmas. Carla asked how the group would feel if her grandbabies came for a swim in the morning. We established some guidelines- like not just Carla\u2019s grandkids could be invited, but only toddlers can come for the swim and they had to be brought by a female (or female presenting- this is a ladies weekend after all). There would be a strict time frame and we didn\u2019t plan on curtailing our behavior- so fair warning I guess. The group was divided, some feeling like they would feel stifled and it would change the whole vibe, others feeling like a morning time would not interfere with the craziness and it would be fun. I suggested that we do a vote, majority rules.  Here\u2019s where I might be the ahole. When the verdict was in, one person, we\u2019ll call her Jen, said she was out. She didn\u2019t want to come because the vote didn\u2019t go her way. I told her she was being a spoiled brat, and that she was having a childish petty tantrum just because she wasn\u2019t getting her way. Jen told me she didn\u2019t want to pay for something when she didn\u2019t agree with the way things went and that I should \u201crespect her boundaries\u201d. This isn\u2019t the first time that Jen has said or done something sideways, but it is the first time I called her out. Now I\u2019m wondering if I\u2019m the one being petty. So Reddit? Am I the Ahole? ",

        "selftext": "We (both 26nb) met in 2021, they started dating my then flatmate. We became friends, tho not super close. A year later I moved countries and the three of us lost touch, just the occasional chat and Instagram comment. They broke up last year and me and my friend started talking more. I am in a bit of a rough situation. This move was not a smart decision - it's a tiny town (I'm a city person), with very few opportunities; going out, making friends, getting food, etc. The foreign language doesn't help. I am now conversational, but not fluent, which made jobs hard. I have a job, but it sucks and is only 30h. Due to that and some other things, I am in debt (~9000 USD). I want to move to bigger city with my bf (the only good thing in my life right now) but that obviously costs money. So I'm super depressed and stressed out. My friend has a big trust fund (which I knew), but don't have access to yet because of age. However, there's apparently some workaround, and they wanted to pay off my debt and give me some extra for the move, I can quit my job, and recover from my burnout. I didn't ask about the workaround, that felt like looking a gift horse in the mouth. I am obviously ecstatic. This is HUGE and life changing. They even want to give me money to open my own business. But this offer was made months ago and something always comes up. It's constantly 'will have it sorted by Tuesday!' or whatever. I have no right to this money but obviously I'm kinda banking on it and I hate that I'm now becoming the bad guy for asking updates As for the title. This friend thinks they can save the world singlehandedly, is always coming up with new ideas to save Luigi, to set up research labs, to collaborate with some royal family in Asia - ofc never happens. They also think they can firebend (yes, really), which has some 'scientific' explanation that they 'researched'. They also cross boundaries constantly, have a new best friend every week (whom they just met and offered money to) who is amaaaaazing and just 'gets' them, and they're addicted to ket (not suprising. When i confronted them, they got defensive and said addiction isn't real). I'm now realising they're quite toxic, and very good at using therapy speech to justify their behaviour; but acknowledging bad behaviour doesn't matter if nothing changes. I don't think this friendship is sustainable, but I'm not in a position to let go of the promise of money. What was meant to be a blessing is turning out to be a burden. My mental health even worse. I already set up a GoFundMe for them to send money to (tax reasons, apparently) but NOTHING happens. I don't wanna leave them, I genuinely care for them, but I just don't know what to do. WIBTA if I took the money and ran? Tldr; friend offered huge amount of money to help with debt & mental health, but nothing is happening and getting frustrated. Found out they are probably delusional and addicted. Don't know if I can keep this friendship but need the money.",

        "selftext": "A few days ago, I (21M) asked my friend (21F) if she wanted to hang out this weekend because I feel like she\u2019s become distant recently. She hasn\u2019t been willing to meet up with me so I was worried and was eager to meet up again. I messaged her a few days ago asking if she wanted to hang out next weekend. She lives in the next town. I have an appointment at 5:20 PM on Saturday, but I didn\u2019t mention this to her at first. I messaged her a few times asking if she wanted to hang out because she was taking a while to reply or else saying \u2018not sure\u2019. For context, she used to always get annoyed if I would \u201cstring her along\u201d with stuff or if I said \u201cI\u2019ll get back to you\u201d so me messaging her multiple times is just the same as what she did with me.  Eventually, she said that she and another friend were doing something Saturday evening and that I \u201ccould come along\u201d. I then mentioned my appointment, and she said, \u2018Why were you asking to hang out if you\u2019re not available?\u2019 I responded, \u2018I never said specifically Saturday evening\u2014it could\u2019ve been Saturday morning or Sunday.\u2019 She got annoyed with me telling me to mention it next time because saying the weekend gives the impression anytime Saturday or Sunday. Am I the asshole for asking her to hang out in the first place when I knew my availability wasn\u2019t great? I really wanted to meet up with her over the weekend but just Saturday evening, I wasn\u2019t available. Friday evening, Saturday (first half of day) and all of Sunday would\u2019ve worked. I believe she\u2019s free the rest of the weekend, she\u2019s not working or anything at the moment. Probably just asked me to come saturday because she was already meeting with her other friend then anyway. I kinda feel like an idiot though for not saying it at the time. We\u2019ve been becoming very distant lately and I feel I\u2019ve really screwed things up with this episode.",

        "selftext": "WIBTA for giving my dad the wrong name? So here\u2019s my situation. My (31M) Dad (50\u2019s M) lives on the other side of the country from me and my sister (27). He\u2019s a very old school conservative type guy and it\u2019s affected our relationship over the years due to him constantly brining up politics knowing we  disagree. I won\u2019t get too into it, our relationship needs a whole post of its own.  Last summer we made a trip to see him so his side of the family could meet my niece  (2 and adorable) We can call her L for the sake of this story. L has always preferred women, to the point where she\u2019s usually very uncomfortable around new men. She looooves me now (Def favorite uncle) but getting to this point took a lot of hard work, patience, and stick on tattoos. I never took her uncomfort around men personally but my dad did.  He usually calls us to check in once a week but lately I\u2019ve noticed he refers to L as \u201cthe baby\u201d when we talk about her. I know him, and I know that man has just fully forgotten his granddaughters name. L however didn\u2019t forget his name. How do I know you ask? Because just the other day she was laying on the floor while I was babysitting and I mentioned my dad to my partner. Unprompted L said \u201cI remember Grandpa blank. He liked me. But I don\u2019t really like him\u201d I don\u2019t think this is a case of him getting old and losing his memory, because he can still bring up older memories and names of his friends he hasn\u2019t seen in decades.  My plan is next time he says \u201cthe baby\u201d I\u2019m gonna say \u201cThe baby? You mean\u2026\u201d and give him a name that is maybe 2 or 3 letters off Ls name, but rhymes. Think Hannah to Lanah kind of vibe. I\u2019ve already run that idea by my mom and step-dad and they both nearly spilt their drinks laughing. Would this make me the asshole?",
