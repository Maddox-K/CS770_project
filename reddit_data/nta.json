        "selftext": " So, I'm getting married to my fiance soon. I bought my wedding dress weeks ago. His my (FMIL) kept pestering me about trying it on but I firmly refused. I finally shut it down after she offered me 100$ to let her try it on. Her reasoning for presisting so much? She says it's because of her love for wedding dresses and her obsession with them. Fast forward to yesterday, I came home from work early and I found my fiance at home. He freaked out after seeing me and tried to prevent me from going into my room while trying to text somebody on his phone. I opened the door and was shocked to see his mom standing there wearing my dress. I instantly pulled out my phone and took a photo of her in it. Sheand my fiance freaked out after I told her that she needed to pay me for a new dress in 3 days or else I'll show the whole family the photo. She started crying and then left and my fiance blew up at me saying I can't be serious and that I overreacted because his mom just wanted to try the dress on, no harm done. But I refused to listen to him because in my opinion, the dress should only be worn by the bride and the bride only. quite frankly, I felt disgusted looking at the dress again, I don't want it anymore. And so I think it's fair that she pays me after she ruined it for me. He yelled at me. and told me to wake up and stop treating his mom like that as if she was an enemy. We had a fight after he failed to get me to back down and he's been staying with his mom since then. I felt awful, but I spent 3k on this dress and worked hard .to get it, I can't stand looking at it but people in my family think I'm escalating things and risking my relationship with not only FMIL but my fiance as well. AITA? Update: Oh My God! This blew up, and so I thought I'd add some updates. My fiance called and offered to pay for the dress himself so we can end the conflict but he wants me to : * hand him my phone so he can delete the photo himself.* Swear that I don't have any copies to use against his mom later.* Apologize to his mom.* And lastly, He asked that I quit his family group chat and log out of facebook for at least a month. I haven't responded yet. P.s He called with this offer/conditions hours ago but I didn't want to include this in the post but now I did. Also, I'm not sure if I'll agree because I don't want him to pay for it, I want his mom, the one who wore it to pay for it. Not being vicious but trying to hold her accountable.",

        "selftext": "Hi! Obviously a throwaway for privacy, also am new to posting so I hope I do this correctly! When I was 18, my dad gifted me a house with two stories. I am extremely thankful, we are not upper class but my dad bought this house for a cheap price a long time ago (it was his grandmothers cousin's house). I know that this was an extreme privilege and I am forever grateful for this.  The layout of this building is like an apartment, but it is a house. So basically, each story has its own separate entry, its own kitchen and bathroom. I live upstairs while I rent out the downstairs. My boyfriend 25m moved in with me about three months ago and we have been together for six months. I have not asked him for money, neither for utilities or to pay me any rent. The only thing he contributes to is groceries, that we split 50/50. I have not brought up that I own the building as it is not something I tell many people, if people ask me I of course tell them that I own it, but if they just assume I am a renter then they can believe that. The topic of a landlord, the renter downstairs or the owner of the building has not been something we have talked about.  This last Tuesday the renter came up to tell me that her freezer has stopped working. I answered the door and my boyfriend heard us talking I suppose. I went downstairs to take a look and we came to the conclusion that she would buy a new one, send me the receipt and I would give her the money. She was very grateful for this solution. When I went upstairs my boyfriend asked if it could be fixed, I told him no, but she was going to buy a new one and I would pay for it. He looked at me like I was crazy and asked me why the hell I would pay for her freezer, I told him that because I am her landlord and the freezer was there when she started renting, I would stand for the cost. He just asked me if I was serious, to which I said I was. He begun screaming at me, asking him why the hell I would hold this information from him and that I was an evil person. I said I was sorry for not telling him but I did not think that it would matter. He said he could not believe he was together with someone who is a landlord, that all of us just use people for money and that the only thing \u201cwe people\u201d care about is money and would rather have people be homeless then offering affordable rent. (The downstairs is 1 kitchen, 1 bath and 4 other rooms, I charge 500 dollars in rent). I understand many people have had trouble with landlords, but I try my best to be a good one. He demanded that I give him 50% of the money I make from rent or else I was just as bad as he thought. Was I really the asshole for not telling him? He has not talked to me since Tuesday and I have tried telling him that I am truly sorry but he doesn\u2019t answer me at all. Edit: obligatory edit to add that I certainly did not expect this to blow up the way it did, I have tried to read as much as I can. Thank you all for your advice and support, I have talked with him and I will update later tonight when I had have time to process everything that went down and try to write it out as best as I can. For the people who was worried about my safety, I called my dad who was sat outside in his car when I talked with my boyfriend and I am safe as of right now and hope it will continue that way. Thanks yet again to everyone Edit 2: update posted, sorry for the rushed update and weird writing, it is explained in my update as to why. Thanks yet again",

        "selftext": "Edit: ON his birthday, really should have spell checked before posting.  I (18f) have been dating my boyfriend, John (20m) for a little under a year. We have a pretty toxic free relationship but there\u2019s quite a bit of tension when it comes to me being vegetarian. I\u2019ve been vegetarian since 11 and I have very strict morals around it. The one thing John has a problem with is me refusing to spend my money on meat. Ever since I started making my own money, I swore to myself that I would never spend a cent of it on meat. On our dates, we usually spilt the bill and sometimes he pays for it all. I told him if he orders something meat-free, I\u2019d happily pay for both of us but he never does. When he pays for my food, it\u2019s when I\u2019ve spend money on the activity. Normally concerts and festivals. That\u2019s me paying \u20ac120+ on tickets and him spending maybe \u20ac50 on food His birthday was a few days ago and we went out for dinner at his favourite fancy restaurant. He got the most expensive steak they had along with a side salad and a bottle of wine. When we finished our food, I asked the waiter to spilt the bill and John looked at me shocked. He asked if I was joking and I said no. Then he told me he thought I was going to pay since it was his birthday and he didn\u2019t budget for the meal. I asked him why he thought I\u2019d pay since I\u2019ve been very clear about my rule but he couldn\u2019t give me a reason other than it being his birthday. I told him I\u2019d pay for the wine and the side salad, but he\u2019d need to pay for the steak. He was furious with me and stormed off to the bathroom. I paid for my meal, the wine and the salad and waited for him to come back. He didn\u2019t. After waiting for 20 minutes, I left. I found him sitting on a bench near where we parked the car. I asked him why he left and reminded him he needed to pay. He looked shocked when I said that and asked me if I didn\u2019t pay. I told him I\u2019d paid for everything but the meat and he lost it. He started yelling at me, telling me I was selfish, that I needed to grow up. I stayed calm and told him he needed to go back and pay. He scoffed and walked away. I ended up driving home without him. Now he\u2019s saying it\u2019s my fault that he can\u2019t show his face in his favourite restaurant since he dined and ditched. It\u2019s a pretty small restaurant so he\u2019d 100% be recognised and kicked out. So, aita? EDIT: To the people commenting about me not \u201ctreating\u201d him on his birthday, yes, I did. I even dipped into my savings for his present. EDIT 2: I did not \u201ctake him out\u201d for dinner. He was the one that suggested it.",

        "selftext": "Alright so I (22m) think this whole thing is ridiculous but my gf (21f) is really angry at me so here we go: I don't like giving my real name at places like Starbucks and similar stores where they shout out your name when the order's ready.  I can't tell you why, I have a normal, reasonably common name I like fine enough but for some reason it majorly creeps me out when a barista shouts my name through a room full of strangers. I guess it's just some (at least to me) harmless quirk I have.  So whenever I am at a store where they want your name I say it's Tom, that's literally the name I use, nothing inappropriate or outlandish just plain Tom. I know I am meant when they call it as I always use the same one so there is no confusion or anything, they yell Tom I get my drink/food and it's never been a problem till now.  A couple days ago I was at Starbucks with my new gf and ordered our drinks while she sat down, I gave them my fake name as always and when our order was ready and they shouted Tom I went and got it. My gf was a bit confused and asked me if I went and got someone else's order which is fair enough so I explained the thing to her and thought that's that but she got really angry.  She says it's really disrespectful to lie like that and that I am making everybody in the store out to be creeps who will do something bad if they know my name which is not at all what's happening I just don't like when they yell my real name so I found a harmless way to get around that. But she can't see it like that, she thinks I am a pathological liar who is way to suspicious of everyone and I need to stop. I really can't see the problem she has, it's really not that deep.  I don't think I am hurting anyone... or am I?? So yeah I am really confused by her reaction and asking myself if I am the asshole after all for some reason I can't comprehend.

        "selftext": " My husband's best friend (female) got the news of her dog's cancer days ago. My husband would call her everyday til yesterday when she visited. I opened the door for her, greeted her then led her to the living room and went into the kitchen to get a class of water after my husband asked me. I came back and didn't find them in the living room. Turns out they went into the guests room and the door was shut. I heard weeping/sobbing sounds coming from the inside. I knocked then got in and found them embracing each other crying. I stood by the door but my husband paused and told me to give them a moment. I gotta say that I did not feel comfortable with his request so I remained standing. He got up and started repeatedly telling me to get out. I told him it's my house and he can't tell me where I can and cannot stay. He got angry and told me to get out and we'll talk later but I refused. He asked what was wrong with me for not seeing how tense the situation was and for not giving them privacy. I told him that they did NOT need to shut the door for any reason nomatter what it was. We argued and she ended up leaving. He blew up at me afterwards calling me unbelievable and saying I had no respect for him and his friend who's going thtough a hard time and refusing to give them privacy. I told him how weird it was for them to shut the door just becsuse they were crying. He told me that I was petty and overbearing to act like this infront of her and stopping him from showing proper support.  Now he's completely gone radio silent and is acting like I kicked her out or treated her poorly. Some context: 1: Ages of those involved are 26Female, 28Female, and 31Male. 2: She's been his best friend/sister like for over 8+ years. 3: She tends to be very emotional and highly sensitive. 4: We don't get along because she tends to be a boundary stomper and does/says things that make me feel like I don't know my husband as much as she does. She also compares us as well. 5: Initially, I did not want her to come to the house but my husband called her and told her to come since he didn't see her after the news was received til yesterday.",

        "selftext": "My daughter, Alexandra (14F), hates any shortened version of her name. This has gone on since she was about 10. The family respects it and she\u2019s pretty good about advocating for herself should someone call her Lexi, Alex, etc. She also hates when people get her name wrong and just wants to be called Alexandra. She took Spanish in middle school. The teacher wanted to call all students by the Spanish version of their name (provided there was one). So, she tried to call Alexandra, Alejandra. Alexandra corrected her and the teacher respected it. She had the same teacher all 3 years of middle school, so it wasn\u2019t an issue.  Now, she\u2019s in high school and is still taking Spanish. Once again, the new teacher announced if a student had a Spanish version of their name, she\u2019d call them that. So, she called Alexandra, Alejandra. Alexandra corrected her but the teacher ignored her. My daughter came home upset after the second week. I am not the type of mom to write emails, but I felt I had to in this case. If matters, this teacher is not Hispanic herself, so this isn\u2019t a pronunciation issue. Her argument is if these kids ever went to a Spanish speaking country, they\u2019d be called by that name. I found this excuse a little weak as the middle school Spanish teacher actually was Hispanic who had come here from a Spanish speaking country and she respected Alexandra\u2019s wishes. The teacher tried to dig her heels in, but I said if it wasn\u2019t that big a deal in her eyes that she calls her Alejandra, why is it such a big deal to just call her Alexandra? Eventually, she gave in. Alexandra confirmed that her teacher is calling her by her proper name.  My husband feels I blew this out of proportion and Alexandra could\u2019ve sucked it up for a year (the school has 3 different Spanish teachers, so odds are she could get another one her sophomore year).

        "selftext": "My fiance M33, and I F28 are getting married in december. His mom is the intrusive type but she's nice overall and we....somewhat get along. I hate to admit that wedding planning has been an absolute nightmare. His mom wasn't willing to agree on most things, and my fiance said that since he's her only son then I should respect and appreciate this vision she has for the wedding and how it should be. She insisted to come along for wedding dress shopping. I took her with me and my mom and friends. I was so lucky to have found what I was looking for. but she picked a dress that she liked so much and said that she always pictured her son's bride in it mom and friends thought this line was creepy. I thought the dress was somewhat creepy and toooootally not my type. I apologized and thanked her for her vision but told her that I'd already decided on a dress that I had envisioned myself wearing at my wedding!. She got all pissy because of it apparently, then must've told my fiance because, he came home in the evening ranting about how I made his mom upset and turned down her help in choosing the wedding dress and excluded her from the process. I asked what process? duh it's just a wedding dress...my wedding dress so I really didn't get how she should get a say at all!. He got upset and said that this attitude of mine isn't working on him or his mom. He said that I should consider the dress his mom wanted me to buy especially knowing that both dresses weren't that much different anyway like she said but I told him yes they were different...like so much different. Anyways, We argued about it then we dropped it. Yesterday I came home and found out that he had returned my wedding dress and replaced it with the one his mom wanted. I called him and he was straightforward about what he did and why he did it. I lost it and started screaming at him. He asked me to calmn down and really give this dress a chance. I refused to even listen I screamed at him without giving him a chance to speak. He got home and we had an argument. I then went to stay with one of my friends and he kept calling and calling then texting saying that I overreacted and it's his wedding too so it wasn't cool how I screamed at him. He insisted I give this dress a chance. He went on and on about how his mom has a vision and good intentions and just wants what best for me as her future daughter inlaw. Mom is livid and has been wanting to go scream at him and his mom but my dad said that this isn't worth ruining my relationship with my inlaws. He suggested I wisen up and go with the flow but is it too much for me to be able to pick my own wedding dress without being guilted about it just to keep the peace?. AITA for my reaction? ETD Q & As I'm editing in some answers to frequent questions I get. A. The dress she picked wasn't all too crazy but just wasn't my type. B. This issue started during wedding planning and there were other things...like way too many things we didn't agree on. but this vision has been there for...quite a while. C. I AM paying for the dress obviously. D. My fiance's dad is deceased. also, his mom suffered from multiple health conditions. Has no daughters but one only son. E. He's still presisting...",

        "selftext": "I'm a software engineer, with a full time job and a side hustle of doing freelance coding work in my own time. I've always been the type to have a side hustle I put a lot of my free time into; I get really bored sitting idle. My freelance hourly rates are $60 an hour, and at my full time job, my hourly pay works out to about $40 an hour. So that's how I value my time.  Anyway, over Christmas vacation, I was staying at my parents house. My cousin was also staying over with her three young kids from Christmas to new year's. I'd been planning on doing some work on my freelance projects when I had free time; in the mornings when my family had no plans. I wasn't in any rush; I was already ahead of schedule on them all, but I didn't really have anything else to do. It was in a really rural area and it's like an hour drive to the nearest anything Then my cousin and her husband asked if I could babysit all day for three days, so they could visit some friends in the area and hang out with just adults. I said I had planned on doing freelance work at the library, and she offered to pay me to babysit. I said I could if they got close to my freelance rates. She wanted a number, and although my freelance rates are $60 I didn't feel like that was right, it was high. But I didn't want to go too low; honestly babysitting 3 kids would be harder for me than the routine coding work I had for my freelance project. I don't know a lot about kids and I've never babysat for long, and I had a feeling it would be stressful and difficult. So I said $35, which is below what I make hourly at work, and what is the bare minimum I'd value my time for, if that time is spent doing difficult work.  And she went crazy at me, saying that's a ridiculous rate for babysitting, that I was entitled and being selfish, that I'm trying to take advantage of how she didn't have other options, etc. I said that's way below what I'd be making if I had the time to do my own work, and I'd be putting off my own work to babysit.  Her husband then got mad at me saying that I was a 24 year old girl, that I'm damn near a child myself, that my time is not worth that much and it's childish to say that it was. And that I was a stupid girl for not knowing that babysitting costs like 15 an hour, when I grew up and have kids of my own I will see how stupid I was being. I was kind of done with being called stupid so I just told them I hoped they could find someone else. My mom thinks that I asked for something offensive, and my cousin and her husband obviously did too. AITA for giving that number?",

        "selftext": "Hi all.  I gave birth four weeks ago, and we decided to have a ''baby ceremony'', where everyone gets to meet our lovely daughter Charlotte.  My cousin Alice and her parents were among the guests. The first thing I'll say about her is that she has expensive taste. She's the sort of person who has a *minimum* price range for how much she spends on clothing. She doesn't own anything that isn't designer and has some items of clothing that cost thousands. She is a banker and still lives with parents so can afford the lifestyle.  It was Alice's turn to hold the baby and she was happy to at first, but suddenly Charlotte vomited on her. Alice handed Charlotte back to me and ran off crying, and spent the rest of the event crying in the car. I went to see her to apologise but she didn't want to hear any of it. My mum gave her one of her shirts which was too big for her and she felt completely upset and humiliated. Today I got a call from my mum, saying that she'd been on the phone to her sister (Alice's mum) saying that they want me to reimburse the cost of the blouse (roughly \u00a31800) since it was completely ruined.  I have said no. At the end of the day we all know what babies can be like. She took a risk wearing something so expensive knowing a baby was nearby and unfortunately it backfired. I feel bad for her but it was not my fault.  Am I doing the right thing by refusing to pay up?",

I finally gave in when I felt we were ready to take one on, and also when I felt he was ready for the responsibility that comes with one. I expected a dog or cat, but he really wanted a hamster. So we spent a little over a week prepping, helping him \u201cstudy\u201d hamster care and dedicated a sizable spot in our living room for necessities and home. We finally get around to picking one out at the pet shop, he\u2019s set on the name Sonic, but the lady ringing us up mentioned the one he picked out was a girl and that she could get him a boy if he wanted, and he just lit up and said \u201cThat\u2019s Amy!\u201d and that was that, we took Amy home.

Basically what happened was, they were picking out names and one of the names they narrowed it down to had Amy as the middle name. I made a joke of something like \u201cHey, we already have an Amy at our house!\u201d Trying to be funny, but SIL didn\u2019t think it was. I didn\u2019t think much about it at the time, but a couple of days ago she asked to come by to talk. She started off by saying the joke I made was in bad taste, I apologized for it, and then she suggested I change the name. I told her I didn\u2019t think that would go over well with my son, and then she outright demanded it be changed \u201cwhether he likes it or not\u201d because she wasn\u2019t going to have a child share the name with a hamster. I agreed to talk it over with my son to see what he thought, and of course he didn\u2019t want to, he even thought it was cool that his cousin would share her name with his hamster. I tried convincing him to rename her Sonic even, or some other Sonic character, but he didn\u2019t want that. I explained how SIL feels about this, and he felt a bit hurt because he thought he upset SIL but he really didn\u2019t want to change the name and didn\u2019t understand why they couldn\u2019t just share it. I told SIL that my son was set on Amy, and she blew up. I\u2019ll admit I got a bit defensive and reacted poorly, but I essentially told her it wasn\u2019t a huge deal, it\u2019s not like anyone is going to make the connection and by the time her child is old enough to know her name, Amy the Hamster likely won\u2019t be around. She claimed it was embarrassing because she would always know the connection in her mind, to which I simply told her if it was such a strong reminder of a hamster then maybe it wasn\u2019t a name she should use for her daughter. My brother has told me that I am being selfish for not forcing my son to pick another name, SIL obviously thinks I\u2019m TA, and my mom has said the whole thing is childish. So AITA?",

His daughter would spend time with my daughter regularly. They adore each other but she doesn't come to my house and they rarely meet up there. His wife has been diagnosed with cancer and has started treatment recently. The other day he came to drop our daughter off and asked to speak to me. He talked about his wife's circumstances then how his family won't be able to have a christmas celebration this year. He said it wasn't fair for his daughter and asked if I could include her in my family's celebration. He pointed out how the girls will have a great time together bonding and making memories, but I said I was sorry but my family's traditional celebration is a sacred thing and I do not feel comfortable including anyone else. Plus it'd be awkward having her in my home. He said that his daughter may not be family to me but she sure is to her halfsister. He asked me to stop and think about what's best for the kids here. I suggested he take his daughter to spend christmas with her grandparents (he said his parents and him are NC) and tried to cut the conversation short but he stopped me and started going on about how cruel it was for me to decline to include his daughter who's already having a hard time adjusting. I saw that he was beginning to cry so I stepped back and said I was no longer feeling comfortable having this conversation. I asked him to leave and he did but still texted me asking me to agree to let his daughter come spend christmas even offered that he stays away if that'll make me less uncomfortable, I said no and now he's calling me selfish and unfeeling. *A point worth mentioning here and that is my family are going to attend and they said that they too will not feel comfortable in this situation thus I said it'd be awkward.*",

Both are single moms and live with us currently. there's been issues about my stepdaughters asking my daughter to babysit the kids. Jessica didn't have a problem with it at first since this is what she does to earn money but since her stepsisters don't pay her much, she'd just refuse to babysit. We worked this out by having my wife take care of paying for the babysitting. I planned a family vacation for 3 days and everyone wanted to go. However, Both Monica & Leah suggested that Jessica stay home and watch the kids since Beth doesn't want her grandkids to come. They said it's because the kids are used to Jessica and hiring another babysitter would cause issues. And also said that Jessica isn't too fond of our destination but it was obvious that Jessica wanted to go. They insisted and Beth offered to pay her double and there was just..a lot of back and forth on this til I demanded they stop bringing it up. We were supposed to go last week but when everybody had bagged their bags and was time to go, Jessica found out that she didn't have her passport on her. We searched her bag then went home and searched there. Beth and my stepdaughters kept insisting that we go back to the airport or else we'd miss our flight. They insisted that Jessica stay at home with the kids. They even told the new babysitter to go home cause she was no longer needed. I refused to go and kept searching for the passport til Monica admitted that she helped Leah hide Jessica's passport to get her to stay home with the kids. I was livid I tried to get her to tell me where it was but she said Leah had it, Leah denied so I threatened to cancel the vacation that's when they gave it back. I decided to actually cancel the vacation and blew up at both of them and berated them. They stayed upstairs for a while and Beth refused to speak to me and said that I punished my stepdaughters for worrying about their kids and wanting them to stay with someone they know. I got told I overreacted and ruined the trip for everybody. Editing to mention that kicking my stepdaughters out isn't possible since my wife co-owns the house that we currently live in.",

        "selftext": "My girlfriend is an incredibly picky eater. Like I said in my title, she eats like she is 10 years old. In fact I'll give a short list of things she refuses to eat; Unflavored water, fish (excluding fried shrimp), anything with bones, cheese other than sharp cheddar, spinach, onions, garlic, pasta without red sauce, eggs, spicy food, aioli, ketchup, potatoes (other than french fries), pastries with fruit, citrus, sausage or any non-American food. This compares to me, someone who grew up in multiple different regions of the US and lived in abroad for a few years, so I'm a bit more adventurous when it comes to food. Whenever me and my girlfriend go out somewhere nice she ends up getting the same meals usually either a burger or chicken tenders and fries. We could be going to an authentic Nepalese restaurant and she will get the french fries and white rice. To me it's kind of embarrassing to go to a restaurant where there is a dress code and for her to order chicken tenders and fries. It especially bothers me that since I typically pay, I end up paying 15 bucks for chicken tenders that I could get from the freezer section at Walmart for 5 bucks. Recently in our area a very nice dinner place opened up and my girlfriend has been dying to go. I took a look at the place and the menu and saw that it looked nice but the food was kind of pricy. She said she was probably gonna get chicken tenders as per usual. I asked her what's the point of going then if I can toss some tenders in the air fryer for her and not spend a ridiculous amount of money on it. She asked why I had an attitude about this and I told her that I thought it was a waste of time and money to go to a nice place to get little kid food. She interpreted this as me calling her a little kid. I clarified that I wasn't calling her a child, however it is kinda childish for her to eat the way she does. I also said that if she's gonna order food we can make at home theres not aby point in us going anywhere. This lead to an argument about me thinking I'm better than her. Aita?",

        "selftext": "Throwaway because my sister knows my reddit and I don't want this causing drama Yesterday, My sister hosted a family dinner at her house. It was one of those just because dinners, no special occasion. My sister is a great cook and she made tons of food for that one night. My daughter, was on her second plate by the end of the night. Once she finished she asked if she could get another one. I said yes. But my sister (her aunt) looked at her with a shocked expression and said Another plate?. My daughter turned around and gave a somewhat un comfortable look. My daughter is 16, and has 2 part time jobs to pay for some of her college tuition, so she usually doesn't eat until 7-8pm. So I didn't even blink twice when she got up to grab her 3rd plate. I turned to my sister and said she's been working all day without anything to eat, you made tons of food, it won't hurt for her to get another plate. My sister started yelling saying something about how it wasn't my place to say if my daughter could get more of her food that she made. Now I do somewhat agree with that, and might be the A-hole because of that. Looking back I'm thinking maybe I should have asked?  My daughter ended up not getting another plate, and the vibe was awkward now so we just decided to go. Before we left out the door my sister stopped me and told me I should've taught my daughter manners and how it isn't right to get more than 1 plate at someone else's house. I told my sister she was being ridiculous and somehow our voices got loud enough where my mom started to hear us in the small corner, she came over and started telling me she agreed with my sister and it was rude for my daughter to eat that many plates. I started to get fed up when they began telling me I wasn't teaching her proper manners, so I left. Then of course they began texting my phone saying how it was rude to leave in the middle of our conversation. I don't think I was the A-hole at all for leaving because I wasn't going to stay in a place where I felt disrespected. But i'm not sure about the plate thing.  So am I the A-hole for assuming my daughter could get another plate?",

After that we got 2 hotel rooms (one for me and Candace, one for the girls). While I was in the room, I got a call from Shiloh at 11pm crying and sounded like she was arguing with her stepsisters. I asked what the matter was and she told me that her stepsisters insisted that she sleep on the floor (there were one large bed in the room and there was enough space for all 3 girls to sleep on). I asked why and she said she didn't know. I went to see what the issue was and talked with my stepdaughters about it. They kept talking but didn't really explain why they told her to sleep on the floor. They just shrugged and said It's better this way...we're more comfortable this way... I told Shiloh to grab her things and when one of my stepdaughters asked where we were going, I told her I was booking her a hotel room. Both looked upset but didn't say anything but they must've called their mom because she was awake when I got back and started arguing with me about giving Shiloh an entire hotel room for herself. I explained why I did it but she said I wasted money and that Shiloh could've sucked it up for one night on the floor. I called her unreasonable for saying this but she told me I showed the girls that I'm playing favorites and made my stepdaughters share a room while I gave my daughter and entire room for herself. We went home and Candace is still bringing it up saying I mishandled this. She even pointed out how my stepdaughters are upset since they're not speaking to me. ETA It was Candace who got a room for the 3 girls as to not stir any drama and save money. She was in charge of hotel reservation since I was emotionaly distressed. Also. Candace did NOT expect Shiloh to sleep on the floor. She wanted all 3 girls to share the bed.  ETA#2 For those that are calling me an ah for giving my daughter her name. Her mom did that and she's deceased so please let's not focus on that. And also, I've known my stepdaughters since they were little. We're pretty much family and Candace is a sahm but I give her full access to my money since this stuff was already discussed before handed. Pretty much everything was.",

        "selftext": "When I was 25, we found out that my father had been cheating on my mother for years and he had a 7 year old daughter with his mistress. In one split second, the happy family I knew was gone, and I went through the darkest time in my life. My parents divorced and per their prenup, my mother walked away with most of their assets (since she also contributed more to the family income). She never forgave my dad for what he did and never talked to him again, though she grudgingly allowed me to have whatever relationship I wanted to have with him. I eventually forgave my dad mostly because I was tired of carrying so much anger and hurt in my heart. I talk to him but I want nothing to do with his mistress or my half sister. My mother died last year and left me everything - her money, her real estate assets, and her business, which I now own and operate. I am in a relatively comfortable financial position, while my dad is... getting by. He was never a good businessman on his own and lost a lot of his money on businesses that later went belly up. This year my half sister was diagnosed with a life threatening sickness, and she has been in the hospital for the last four months. The bills are mounting and my dad came to me for help because they are now in a situation where they are finding it difficult to come up with money for my half sister's treatment. The thing is, I don't want to use my mother's money to pay for the treatment of the child her husband had with his other woman. Though it's not my half sister's fault, it feels so unfair when I think that the money my mother worked hard all her life for will go to a child that neither my mother and I have any responsibility towards, and the very same child of the man and the woman who hurt her so much at that. I'd really rather use it to grow her company and let my dad and my half sister's mother figure out how to get money for her treatment. They are her parents after all. The only thing tying me to her is my father saying She is your sister and If she dies because she didn't get the treatment she needs, would you be able to sleep at night? AITA?",

After a long conversation I agreed to go vegetarian and be vegan in the house and around her, which she was happy with. She also decided our son should be vegan, which after seeing a dietician I also agreed with. Things have been fine with this arrangement until a few months ago when I began finding wrappers from nonvegan candy and even burgers from McDonald's in my sons school bag which he had been buying with chore money. I had a conversation with my son and he confessed he felt lonely and excluded eating vegan around his friends and that they always had much better candy than he did and it wasn't fair. I decided I didn't want him spending his pocket money on snacks and throwing out the vegan snacks we actually brought him instead of buying games etc, it made no sense, but I also know the way my wife feels about nonvegan products. So, I began buying my son what he wanted on our way to football practise instead. Long story short, my wife recently found out what has been going on and completely flipped out. She called me an animal abuse enabler and a few other names and said I was corrupting our son.

She left at around 7:45. 10:15 rolled around and she still wasn't home. I texted and she apologized to me, saying that her friend's son was actually in the next town over (maybe 30 minutes away) and she was coming home now. 11:45 rolled around and she still hadn't come home, so I called her to no answer. Texted her to no response. I was getting very upset 12.30 rolled around and still no response and no answer to my phone calls. I was extremely angry.  1:30 rolled around and my anger had completely transformed into worry. Not answering my calls and texts not read. Around 1:45 I called the police. I have always heard that the first 24 hours of someone being missing is the most important, so I didnt want to delay. I asked them to let me know if there had been any traffic accidents involving her car, and the operator told me that they would put out the word and send some cops to check along the route she would travel. I called all the hospitals in the area to check if she has been checked in and I waited outside watching the road for her car for three hours, partially because I didn't want the kids to hear me on the phone with hospitals, and secondly because I was sick with worry. At 7:00am she came home. She apologized for being out and said she had no excuse. She was driving home and felt tired like she was falling asleep at the wheel, so she pulled over to the side of the road to sleep. When she did that, she found that her brand new phone had stopped working. She says she napped anyway because it was the responsible thing to do, and then came home at 7am to bring the kids to school and get to work on time.  I immediately called the police and told them that she had come home safely and gave them the case number and told them to stop searching, which they did.  My fjance brought the kids to school and left for work. I set out to start cleaning (cleaning destresses me sometimes), and I got a call from a policeman asking where she worked. I told him, and asked why, and I was informed that it was their policy to check on the person's wellness after a missing person is found. I asked them to not go by her work but to give her a call instead. He said he couldn't promise.  My fiance is relatively new to her job. A police officer showed up and asked to speak with her. She is now enraged at me for calling the police and 'sending a cop to her work' and making her look bad. She is saying I overreacted and that she wasn't missing and that I was punishing her for doing the responsible thing and not driving while drowsy. She is saying that she is never going to leave the house again except for work, because she is afraid I'm going to call the cops on her again.  So did I overreact? Should I have waited two days like she suggests? EDIT: Thanks for informing me everyone. I am aware that my ex is posting deranged nonsense in the comments. I won't respond to them because I've made it a policy not to engage with her.",

Now we've been arguing about my wedding dress, This might sound clich\u00e8 but eversince I was young I dreamed of having my own beautiful wedding dress, I can afford it but my STBH thinks it's not okay to waste a couple of thousands on a dress I'm only going to wear once -- yes he might have a point there but for one, this is typical price for wedding dresses. and two, because it's a once in a life time thing then why not make sure it's special? STBH still wasn't convinced, and suggested I rent a dress instead of buying one. He started saying that I'm being irrisponsible with money and brought up how much money I've already put aside to rent a face (he means makeup) and wear fake hair (he means extension) but I have this vision of what I want to...look like, sort of speak, on my wedding and I think that it's my right as a bride. I went ahead and purchased the dress but a day later I found out that it was missing from my closet. I freaked out but he told me he returned it and got the money back. I was shocked I asked him why he did that and he said he thought the dress was ridiculously expensive and that was wasting money and AGAIN suggested I go rent one. I blew up and went off on him which I've never done before. He literally took few steps back and told me to calm down. I said he had no right, I'm the one paying for the damn dress. He got upset and said that there's no I'm paying for it myself in marriage and that my attitude is setting the tone for what type of dynamic we'll have in our marriage, he kept on about how I must expect to him to pay for everything while I keep my money or spend it irresponsibly (but I never tell him how to spend his money) I responded that he gets zero say in how I spend my money whatsoever. he told me that I should grow the f up and stop with the dream wedding dress clich\u00e8 then stormed off to call his mom who chewed me out saying she won't let me ruin her son's financial stability with how I deal with money generally. She too urged me to rent a dress or buy cheaper one, way cheaper than the one I picked and move on but I declined. ETA for repeated questions: Yes, he still has the money and said he'll give it back once we agree to a solution.",

We learned how to substitute ingredients, cook new things, try new things, I adjusted our budget to include more expensive vegan substitutes for her, etc.  None of this has been a problem for me until recently. She saw me cook bacon in a pan, and then I rinsed it out to load in the dishwasher. She exploded in anger (teen years, I\u2019m not too fussed about the anger explosion, I know she doesn\u2019t mean it) and said that that was HER pan for vegan food. I was completely floored and said, kiddo this here is a family pan, older than you, it\u2019s not YOUR pan.  She asked me to purchase her a pan that she can solely use for vegan food. I didn\u2019t want her to feel weird about food, so I said sure, and ordered her a few colored ones that are only for her. The reason they\u2019re colored is so it helps me remember that I\u2019m not to touch them unless I\u2019m cooking vegan.  That wasn\u2019t good enough. Now apparently the dishwasher is \u2018contaminated\u2019 with animal product, and the fridge has \u2018bacon grease fingers\u2019 on it (because I eat bacon and then touch the fridge) and she\u2019s asked me and her mom to completely stop eating meat at home. I don\u2019t mean I literally touch the fridge with greasy bacon hands, because I wash my hands, but it\u2019s clearly enough that it upsets my daughter.  frankly I\u2019m on team hell no, her mom is much more amenable and strongly wants me to consider taking our daughter up on the request. My wife\u2019s reasoning is that both our parents live close so we can eat meat products there, and that she doesn\u2019t want our daughter to feel uncomfortable in the kitchen. My daughter says she is fine with cheese and butter in the fridge, but it\u2019s specifically meat products that make her feel sick. Now I\u2019m sorry for her, but I feel like she just needs to adapt and live side by side, because I\u2019m not going to stop eating bacon in my own house.",

        "selftext": "I have several dogs, one of which is an American Akita. His name is Yankee. I thought it was funny, and he seems to like his name. My sister was in the states the past two years and recently flew home with her boyfriend in tow. First time we've met him, yada yada. I guess she never mentioned me or my dogs, but he was pretty surprised when I told him my dogs name. I didnt think much of it - most of my pets have peculiar names so I assumed it was just an overall reaction.  They left, my partner and I had dinner. Part way through our food my sister called and asked if I'd consider changing my dogs name. I kind of thought she was kidding, but she reiterated that she was serious. The name yankee had upset her boyfriend, quite badly, and he found it offensive. I basically told her to fuck off and tell him to grow up, before going back to my food. The following day they literally show up at my door. I was kind of taken aback - apparently they came to tell me why the name yankee was so awful.  During this discussion he told me it was essentially a slur used against Americans, and asked if I would ever name a dog the n word. I just kind of laughed and told him he was off his nut. Its not that serious. You cant equate the word yankee to something like the n-word. I told him I wasnt going to change my dogs name - he knows it, it'd be a shit ton of work. He's personal protection so it could even damage his work.  They, thankfully, left, but still seemed pretty upset. Thinkinh back now I'm pretty sure theres a company with yankee in the name? I wonder how many letters of complaint he's sent. Anyway, I did message my American friends just to make sure I wasnt being a prick. They all agreed he was being stupid, but I know the US is huge and it might be more of a regional thing? So I'm still not sure. I am starting to feel kind of asshole-ish for not taking him seriously when it may be a genuine issue for him. So, I come to reddit. Two birds, one stone, I know a large amount of Americans frequent this subreddit. Am I am asshole, and is this an issue in the states that I should apologise for? ETA: I had a shower at 70 comments and now we're nearly at a thousand? I cant keep up with them I'm sorry \ud83d\ude2d Anyway, I think he's from the south, and my sisters a tory so he's more than likely a republican.  Eta from my partner; Since this post is gaining traction I want to play a game. We are currently trying for a baby - what are some potential baby names we could mention to him? Just to, you know, upset him a little. We do already have our names picked but no one else knows that.",

My wife makes less money than me and is the type of people who prefers to make her own gifts for people. The issue is she will do this even if the person doesn't want this.I will use myself as an example. For the past few years she has made every single gift I have been given. No matter what I asked for I get a homemade gift, doesn't matter if it is cheap or not. Last Christmas I asked for a new a few things and I got a homemade scarf. I always get her stuff she want. I have talked to her about this multiple time. My birthday was yesterday and I asked her to give me a book. It was only 25 dollars and I sent her the link. I opened the gift and she made some homemade bookmarks. It wasn't even the type oof bookmarks I like. They were made from fabric and I like the wooden ones.  I must have made a face because she asked what was wrong. I told her I didn't want these. I made it so clear what I actually wanted and I have talked to her so many times. I handed them back and went out to buy the book. We had a big fight when I got back, she claims I am being ungrateful and a jerk.  ",

        "selftext": "My (29f) friend, let\u2019s call her Emily (32f) is an amazing person - she\u2019s fun, adventurous, intelligent, super active, a fantastic cook, outgoing and just a great girl to be around. A few years ago she decided not to shave anymore (legs, armpits, female areas) out of protest to the patriarchy, resulting in her having very long dark hair everywhere.  A few days ago, we were having a beer and she told me how sad her dating life was, that she kept meeting guys and having very fun dates but never got a call back or when she tried asking for a second or third date, got rejected in a very generic manner. Now after telling her \u201cyou\u2019re so gorgeous and wonderful, the right man will come don\u2019t worry\u201d multiple times, I decided to go out on a limb and said something along the lines of \u201cI know this is a very superficial thing to say, but do you think it might help a little if you would shave?\u201c  She was very taken aback and told me she was disappointed I would suggest she change her appearance for men and that I was the reason so many women were suppressed. I immediately apologized but the evening was pretty much ruined. I texted her the next day apologizing again for hurting her but she hasn\u2019t replied. I really did not want to hurt her but I also don\u2019t quite see how my comment was that bad so I am not sure how to phrase my apology. So decided to take it here and ask people here how big of an AH I am. UPDATE: I am absolutely overwhelmed by the amount of reactions this got. Thank you all so much for your well-worded answers and for your inputs. Emily messaged me yesterday evening asking if we could talk about the whole thing and we had a phone call.  She started by apologizing for her reaction and by the things she said to me. I told her that I wanted her to know that I and many others love her for who she is and the last thing I wanted was to suggest that she change herself for a guy. Another important piece of advice I got here was to make sure she actually was asking for my opinion and not just venting, so I told her that I was very worried I had given her unsolicited advice. Thankfully she didn\u2019t see it that way. She told me I had always been a loyal friend who had her back and she always had valued my advice, which was why she was so taken aback by my comment. I told her that what I should have said is that I feel like in the past, she has been attracted to men who don\u2019t necessarily share her values, and that she might need to be more clear with her dating choices and first make sure they align with her values to avoid being disappointed. She also agrees with this and we really had a great conversation after that. Thanks again to you all for the insightful comments and for your help!",

With our wedding approaching, He asked if I'd consider wearing flat shoes at the wedding. I was confused, like very confused I asked if he was joking but he went on a rant about how doesn't want to be made fun of on his own wedding. and that if I choose to wear high heels then we will look 'awkward' in the photos and infront of the guests. I refused and he kept calling me selfish and inconsiderate and said that I prioritized a bare of high heels over his comfort and happiness for the big day.  He had his mom involved and she is pushing me to reconsider. When I refused to discuss it she said that my unwillingness to cooperate is a huge indicator of my level of maturity, she then went on a long rant about what lengths 'real wives' are willing to go to to help out their husbands and said that I'm apparently too immature and shallow to be committed in a marriage if I make such an issue out of it. Am I being selfish? It's not just about what I want but the high heels help make the wedding dress look better and I feel like I deserve to look my best at my own wedding just like every bride's dream. His insecurity is preventing me from getting that. AITA?   Edit, typos ). To clarify, I'm slightly taller but he said he doesn't want me to look any taller than that. *answering some questions* ). (1). The gusts he was talking about are his male friends, and the men in his family. They comment on his height all the time, call him names from shorty, koala, Lil D, hobbit and the list is long. They even have a list of jokes about him. (2). Like I said, I'm slightly taller and he doesn't want me to be any taller. (3). We had similar arguments about this height issue before but this is the first time he asks me to not wear heels. Other times he lets me wear them but sometimes refuses to attend events with me. (4).

        "selftext": "I (38M) have a 19 year old daughter Ariel with my ex-wife Lauren (39F). We had Ariel too young, and it was a huge struggle. We moved into Lauren\u2019s family\u2019s. I was working multiple jobs. Me and Lauren were best friends thru all this. But things ended when Ariel was 2. Lauren\u2019s friend Tori (38F) told me that Lauren had been messaging guys and when they went out she would give out her number. I checked Lauren\u2019s phone and found it. I asked for a divorce, Lauren was pissed and wanted to reconcile. I didn\u2019t and got split custody.  Lauren made my life hell. Lauren badmouthed me, would miss pick up times and make decisions without talking to me. Her dad offered money to relinquish custody, I told him off. Ariel is now 19 and just started college. The deal was me and her mom would split it.  I remarried Tori when Ariel was 6. Tori was a rock during the divorce but we didn\u2019t date till 2 years later. Lauren used this to warp Ariel against Tori and our son (13M). She excludes them. Whenever she spends the night she will just talk to me or go to her room if my family was around. Our son walks to the basement if she comes over. It hurts me a lot. I\u2019ve spent thousands on therapy before people bring that up. It still is being utilized. But at this point Ariel is being nasty for the sake of it. Her mom has convinced her I cheated with her friend and had a baby. Which is funny because as I\u2019ve pointed out. The timelines don\u2019t even match up. I\u2019ve done everything at this point including family time, 1 on 1 and therapy. Ariel is plain rude to them and they are done trying.  Ariel graduated from HS in may and hosted a party. I was invited but my family wasn\u2019t. I told Ariel I found that disrespectful. So I\u2019d send a card but wouldn\u2019t be going. She didn\u2019t care and we haven\u2019t spoken since. I get a call from Lauren saying she paid the first semester and was wondering when I\u2019d be paying. I said I was no longer paying. As I\u2019m not pulling money out of my household, when Ariel is disrespectful to 2/3rds of it. My ex went off. Saying we had an agreement. I reminded her of when her dad tried to buy my custody. And said \u201cyou have what you\u2019ve always wanted. Full control and custody. You won. So figure it out\u201d. Then texted her that I\u2019ve been putting up with this long enough. She got her 18 years of child support from me. So until she planned on setting the record straight that I was done with both of them. And blocked her. I called Ariel and told her the same. Gave the reasons I\u2019m not paying and told her she needed to look into loans. But I would pay for college if she at least tried to form a bond with my family because she created this situation with her attitude. So if she wants my help, she needs to attempt it. She started crying. But I didn\u2019t fall for it. Told her what my expectations were and to let me know what her plan is so I can move the money around. My wife is on my side here. Saying we\u2019ve been the bad guys for long enough. But I\u2019m getting shit from others. AITA?",

        "selftext": "I 23m was repeatedly stuck playing the part of helper and babysitter on family outings. I had to move out of my parents' house because I kept being forced to help watch my three nephews. Last year we took a family vacation in summer to the coast. I rode along with my parents, and they paid for my hotel room. Only, I had to share that room with three rowdy boys because my sister and her husband wanted a room to themselves. I was promised time to do my own things on the vacation. But instead I ended up having to help with these kids. I complained to everyone about it, and was reminded I was there for free. And then we pretty much just did only one thing I wanted to do. Which was tour an art gallery. I like doing this whenever I'm at the coast. But the kids find it boring. This year my parents have a beach trip planned for June. And they assumed I'd be riding along the same way as last year. But I refused. I said I'd be driving myself, and paying for my own hotel stay to have my own room. My parents were shocked, and tried to remind me of the cost. I said it was no worry. I've got a good job and a decent running car. I can more than afford it. That's when the Buts started. I stated the previously listed things as why I'll be driving myself and paying for myself. I want to be able to enjoy this vacation as an adult, and not be treated like a child like last year. My parents told my sister, and she called to blow up at me that I'll be ruining the vacation if I'm off doing my own thing while she has to wrangle her three boys. I ended up yelling at her that last year all she did was rope me into her mess. I didn't really get to do much of anything I wanted to do. And I was treated like the bad guy for wanting to just go to an art gallery. I'm a grown man. I deserve my own vacation too. Now my sister is not speaking to me, and my parents are still trying to convince me to just ride with them to keep the peace. I'm still refusing. But the pressure is getting to me. AITA for not giving in? I know they'll have a pretty hard time when they won't have another person there to help. Edit: It's barely been an hour since I posted. But my sister is apparently a reddit lurker in the mornings, and she saw my post. Not only is she furious with me. But she's also upset no one in the comments is siding with her. To make it short, she went on a big rant about how it's so hard to be a parent to triplets. And the least I could do is help because I'm young and single, and she needs a break. I stood my ground on my decision, and now she's calling our parents to get them involved. I'm expecting a call from them any minute. Update: Well I'm off work now, so I can tell more of what went down. I guess you could say it's over. My sister got our parents involved, they looked at my post, and were absolutely horrified by the continuous influx of commenters. Yes they're very angry with me that I posted here. But I told them that if they'd just listened to me to begin with, I'd have never needed to. I'm sick of the whole keep the peace mentality that sacrifices me to placate my sister. They in turn went off on my sister, and to make a long story short the whole vacation has been canceled. The hotel wasn't booked yet anyway. But my parents are arguing with my sister, my sister is blaming me, and my nephews are crying because they aren't going to the beach. My sister called me at lunch and basically implied I have no life, which is why I have time to help. I recorded that and told our parents, and that's currently what they're fighting about. Smol Update: I wasn't gonna update again. But here's a little more. Parents said that they won't ever push babysitting of my nephews on me again, and have agreed that what happened last year was unfair to me. Right now they're VERY angry with my sister for telling me I should help her because she thinks I have no life. My sister is playing the victim. And my brother in law is basically saying Nope! to the whole mess and spending most of his time at work.  Thank you to everyone who has commented. You made my day.",

        "selftext": "I (20) am a mother of triplets whom are only 2 months old. I never expected ever in my life that I'd be a mother to triplets so when I first became pregnant it was definitely the last thing in my mind.  I'm home with my babies all day long and had to even transfer my education to online.  Sometimes I just need some fresh air especially when I can't get them to stop crying and I find myself getting super frustrated to the point of tears, it's honestly soo hard and the dad isn't here to help as he's ether at work or at school.My fiance's (24) parents rented us a main floor apartment so when I step outside I'm literally just sitting on the chair right beside the door plus I have a baby monitor step up in their room and it has a camera on it I can literally see them and hear them so if anything happened I'd be able to quickly get to them.  Being able to step outside for a few minutes to take a breather is really important to me because I start to have mini panic attacks when I can't get them to stop crying and I get really frustrated because I just feel super overwhelmed, Being able to go outside just gives me a chance to clam down.  My fiance came home to me sitting outside while the babies were crying and freaked out on me calling me a horrible mom and a bunch of other names that I'm not gonna list here. He thinks that I was being super neglectful and putting the babies in harm way and even told his parents and now everyone seem to be really against me.  I grow up in the system my fiance's family is the only family I have and ever known so it breaks my hurt that they are so upset with me but I really don't think I was doing anything wrong or putting my babies in harm way but they seems to think otherwise. So here I am wondering if I should apologize for my actions or if I am the A-hole in this situation. ~~~~~~~~~ Update ~~~~~~~~~ I decided to show my fiance this thread at first he was really upset with me for sharing our personal problems with strangers on the internet even though it's anonymous.  But in the end when he had a chance to clam down and hear me and all of you guys out he actually apologized and promised me he'd be more involved with parenting and even is willing to take parenting classes which I'll hold him to that.  I just wanna thank everyone for the support that you all give me it brought tears to my eyes (happy tears) seeing how supportive you all were to a stranger on the internet I don't think I ever received this much support before.  I can't believe how much attention this post even got plus the award again thank you so much.",

        "selftext": "I have a good job, I make good money and I work hard enough to earn it. To the point that about 4 years ago after our son was born when my wife decided not to go back to work I became the only source of income.  This worked out well and everyone was happy until COVID hit. Once the pandemic started causing shut downs my role was transitioned from in an office downtown to working from home. I was a big fan of this. I work 5am to 7pm Mon to Sat typically so not having to commute meant that now I got to be home to put my son to bed and read to him at night and have more time to spend with my wife in the evenings. The only problem is that my wife has struggled with the idea that the location of my job has changed but my responsibilities have not. I've had several discussions with her about the fact that even though I'm home now I'm not able to watch our son during the day, or explaining why I can't get to the dishes till that evening. She will nod along to but I don't think she really believes it. This has caused tension but not an outright fight until this week. Some of our mutual friends are coming into town this weekend and we had made plans to spend time with them. However, on Monday my wife informs me that the couple is actually getting in Friday and she and her friend are going to get lunch and go shopping. She tells me that I will need to watch our son. I respond by saying again that I can't, I have work and Monday to Friday is not enough heads up for me to take a day off. She gets angry at me saying she watches our son everyday while I just sit in my office from sun up to sun down and how I should be able to watch our son so she can have a day off. She's given me the cold shoulder since then. I would love to spend the day with my son I just can't take the time off on such short notice. AITA?",

        "selftext": "So the judgement is pretty much exactly as the title suggest. I will provide context tho. So I (28M) have been married to my wife for 4 years and we have a 2 year old son together. My older sister Ariel has 2 kids with her husband. She is my only sibling but we do not speak and haven\u2019t since my wedding 4 years ago. My wife knew I had no relationship with my sister or mother whenever we got together but now it\u2019s causing an argument.  We were a pretty typical family until my mom cheated my senior year of high school with a coworker. My dad moved out immediately and I moved with him. This caused the riff between me and my sister. My sister believed since my mom was sorry and it was a one time thing (as she claimed which I don\u2019t for a second believe) and was trying to reconcile thru the church that me and my dads refusal to speak with her was somehow wrong. I was 18 and my sister was 20. Long story but eventually my sister stopped speaking with my dad. I haven\u2019t seen my mom since 2016 and we have only spoken once since in 2019 when she tried to invite herself to my wedding. She was not invited but my sister was out of courtesy. My sister didn\u2019t show up and we have not spoken since. My wife knew when she married me that my only family was my dad and my cousins. She said it was okay and she didn\u2019t care. So a few months ago my wife got a call from my sisters husband (I\u2019ve never met him) and he said that he wanted to start mending the bridge and would like to have me come meet their kids. I said no. Well then my sister started sending pics of her kids to my wife and my wife sent pictures back. I told her multiple times I did not like this and she told me she could send pics to whoever she wants. I said that if she keeps testing my boundaries she will be a single parent really soon. That she signed up for me as is. My wife is saying it\u2019s wrong to deprive my son of his family. I said I don\u2019t even have a relationship with my sister or BIL so why should my kid? That doesn\u2019t make me feel comfortable at all and I don\u2019t even know these people. Also any pic she sends could easily be forwarded to my mom and she needed to think about that. She said she doesn\u2019t even understand why my mom can\u2019t meet her kid and that comment alone pissed me off because I\u2019ve explained my family drama for years and it feels like she just ignored it. I said she really needs to think about who she wants to appease because I\u2019m not gonna stand for disrespect of my boundaries. My dad totally agrees with me and is telling me I should start setting aside money now for a exit strategy. Because my wife\u2019s behavior is exactly how my mom used to act and I should see the warning signs now. AITA?",

        "selftext": "My wife and I have three children. They are 17, 15, and 10.  My oldest has no intention to do anything after high school.  At least none he has made clear to us.   So I gave him the same ultimatum my parents gave me.  Either go to university, get a job, or GTFO.  I chose to travel the world for two years. I had a lot of sailing experience and my father had a lot of friends in that community so I was able to sail around the world earning money and working my ass off.  It wasn't a two year vacation.   My family is well off and I could have chosen an indolent life.  But I knew I would be a disappointment if I chose that.  So when I got back I enrolled in university and eventually went to work for the family business.   My wife thinks that I'm being unfair to our poor baby boy throwing him out into the world.  I'm not. We have the money to pay for his university.  We have the money for all three kids.   My middle child will probably end up with a good chunk of it in her pocket.  She is on track for an academic as well as a golf scholarship.   The 10 year old is 10 and who knows what's he's going to do.  But he knows the plan.  We have not been secretive about this rule.   My wife and I agreed that we would raise productive members of society before we got engaged.   Her and my son think I'm being cruel to expect him to fend for himself at 18.  I have offered him multiple opportunities to do other things.  He has no interest in anything beyond his computer.  I am at a loss. I don't think I'm wrong for expecting an adult to adult.  My parents have already told him that they will not be giving him any money if he isn't in school or working. My wife is threatening to use her salary to support him. I don't have any say in that.  I won't actually kick him out of the house but I will stop paying his bills and cut off our grocery budget by 20%.  If she wants to work so he doesn't have to there is nothing I can do about that.",

        "selftext": "She\u2019s my fianc\u00e9e right now but the argument we\u2019re having is that once we\u2019re married, she wants her name on the house deed. Years ago, I bought several acres as soon as I could afford it. Back then it was part of a ranch surrounded by other ranches. The owner needed money so he parceled out this section and sold it to me. I built a small house on it and have lived in it ever since. Since it was originally part of a ranch, I did enough to legally keep it classified as a ranch so the property tax is extremely low.  Over the years, companies started to move to the neighboring big city and land prices started to go up. Almost all of the ranchers sold their lands to developers so now there are huge houses surrounding mine. They start from $500,000 and go to several million. None of them sit on even an acre of land. My house is clearly the worst house around and I have no doubt it\u2019s bringing the value of nearby houses down.  That\u2019s all happened before I met and dated my fianc\u00e9e. Now that we\u2019re engaged, we\u2019re talking seriously about our finances and the only sticking point is the house. She wants her name on the deed once we\u2019re married because we\u2019ll be sharing our lives. Alternatively, she wants me to sell the house and we purchase a house together. I don\u2019t find either options attractive. In our state, whatever we bring to the marriage we take out. Since I will be bringing the house into the marriage, I can leave with it should things not work out. If I put her name on it, then she\u2019ll get half. If I sell the house, there\u2019s no way I\u2019ll be able to afford anything that\u2019s even close to what I have now. Not to mention our property tax will be several times higher. Then there\u2019s the drive time. My house is 30 minutes away from my work and 40 from hers. House prices has gone up so much that we\u2019ll have to move at least an hour away from our jobs.  Like I said, we agreed with or compromised on everything else. This one issue is the only sticking point and it\u2019s becoming a big one. So much so that she brought her family into it. This weekend her father took me out to dinner to have a man to man talk. He told me that if we\u2019re going to join our lives, we have to join everything. He expects me to do the right thing if I want to join their family. So now it\u2019s her entire family on one side and me by myself on the other. Am I wrong to want to keep the house I built by myself to myself? Edit 1 to answer a good question: Neither of us are rich. I bought the land at a very low price but now it\u2019s worth 10 times as much. Even if I offer to sell half of it to her at its current value, there\u2019s no way she can afford it. That\u2019s why if we buy a house together, we\u2019ll have to move far from here and our jobs in order to get one we can both afford. Edit 2 to answer some common questions: In all, I spent about $200,000 to buy the land and build the house. Everything is paid off and I pay the extremely low taxes every year. The tax assessment on my property is about $2 million. I don\u2019t know anything about refinancing but at our salary level, I highly doubt we would qualify. In fact, we\u2019ve spoken to a real estate agent and with a 20% down, our salary qualifies us for a $300,000 house. The property tax on a $300,000 house is many times the currently tax I pay now. I\u2019m comfortable with us living in my house and paying all the taxes and maintenance by myself. Edit 3 to answer a common question: Many are asking about my compromise and pointing out her lack of financial security. My compromise is that we live in my house and I will pay all of the taxes, bills, and maintenance costs. Based on our conversation with the real estate agent, if we buy a $300,000 house, her half of the mortgage would be about $1,300 not including her half of the property tax and down payment. I pointed out to her that if I pay for everything toward my current house, she would be saving at least $15,600 a year over 30 years on the mortgage alone. That doesn\u2019t include the money she would be saving not paying the down payment and property tax. In my mind, that would give her plenty of financial freedom and security. Also, if I sell the land, I don\u2019t want to buy any new house outright with that money. The reason we went to see a real estate agent is that if we buy a house together, I want it to be something we can both afford (mortgage, down payment, taxes divided equally). I would put any money I make off the sale into my retirement account. That\u2019s the main reason why I haven\u2019t sold my land despite many developers begging me to (yes, some actually begged). I view it as my retirement investment.",

I don't use birth control due to my condition but I did insist on a condom. Lo and behold I'm pregnant my gynecologist confirmed it.  Now, I'm in a good position financially. I have a stable job and enough savings to live a very comfortable life. I'm close to my parents and sister. So, I have decided that I will keep the baby. I have always wanted to be a mum and this might be my only chance.  I contacted the father and told him. I said I'd be happy to co parent should he be interested but I understand if he isn't. I would be filing for child support regardless though.  The guy absolutely lost it and said I need to abort the baby and that I lied to him. Apparently he asked me what my opinion on abortion is to prevent this situation. I remember him asking me but he never specified his question and I thought it was more general. I told him I'm pro choice which is true. He must have interpreted this as me saying I'd abort any possible pregnancies.  Ever since he has been harassing me to abort. He must have given my number to his parents because today I got a call from his mother imploring me to have an abortion.  I have made up my mind and I won't have an abortion. My family is extremely supportive of my decision but I'm not sure if I'm in the right anymore. Edit since it keeps coming up. I did not tell him that I'm infertile and it was me who insisted on the condom. He was quite happy to hit it raw as he said.",

        "selftext": "I (35M) have been married to my wife (32F) for five years, and we\u2019ve been struggling financially for the past few months. I lost my job about three months ago, and while I\u2019ve found part-time work, it doesn\u2019t pay nearly as much as before. We\u2019ve had to cut back on a lot of things, but it feels like no matter what we do, we\u2019re still living paycheck to paycheck and even pulling from savings. Recently, my mom (65F) came over to visit, and she noticed how stressed I was about the money situation. She offered some advice on how we could save money\u2014things like cutting down on takeout, meal prepping to avoid buying groceries multiple times a week, and switching to cheaper brands. My mom has always been frugal, especially when she was raising me and my siblings on a tight budget. I thought it made sense, especially since we\u2019re really trying to save wherever we can. I asked if she was willing to go through our spending and show where we could cut down. My wife agreed with this. She made a whole spreadsheet about our spending, and we are spending wayyyyy to much on fun stuff. We don\u2019t need Starbucks everyday and so on. It also became apparent that most of the fun spending was my wifes Tbh my wife didn\u2019t take the breakdown well and started arguing with my mom that her spreadsheet was wrong. She said that my mom\u2019s way of doing things is \u201coutdated\u201d and doesn\u2019t work for us. She doesn\u2019t want to give up buying organic produce, and she likes having variety in what we eat each week. I tried to explain that we need to make some sacrifices if we want to get out of this financial hole, but she kept insisting that things weren\u2019t as bad as I was making them out to be and that we just needed to \u201cride it out.\u201d My mom left at this point and we were still arguing, and she told me she can\u2019t give up her takeout . She also went on about my mom being wrong. That\u2019s when I lost my patience and said, \u201cYou\u2019re f***ing wrong. My mom is right. She managed to raise three kids on one income, and we can\u2019t even cut back on groceries for a few months? .\u201d My wife got really upset, saying I am being a huge jerk for winding with my mom and that my mom is outdated. She\u2019s barely spoken to me since, and now I\u2019m wondering if I went too far. But the way I see it, we need to be realistic about our situation, and my mom\u2019s advice could actually help us get back on track.",

Changing my name wasn\u2019t a priority\u2014updating IDs, legal documents, and bank accounts would be a huge hassle. I still use his last name on official documents but go by my maiden name socially. Recently, he got engaged to a wonderful guy. I\u2019ve been supportive of their relationship, but during my grandson\u2019s birthday party, my ex suddenly asked if I\u2019d consider dropping his last name. His fianc\u00e9 chimed in, saying it makes him uncomfortable that I still use it. I was caught off guard and awkwardly joked that unless they want to spend hours in lines at various government offices, I wasn\u2019t going to change it. My ex didn\u2019t laugh. He insisted it\u2019s about starting a new chapter and wants me to \u201cmove on.\u201d The whole situation felt bizarre. For two years, it\u2019s never been an issue, and now they\u2019re ganging up on me? After the party, my ex called and argued that keeping his name makes it hard for his fianc\u00e9 to feel like they\u2019re starting a fresh life.

My ex admitted his fianc\u00e9 is uncomfortable because he sees me keeping the name as a \u201cpower play.\u201d I feel like I\u2019m caught between trying to keep peace and being forced into something just because his fianc\u00e9 is insecure. They want me to go through the hassle of changing everything for their comfort. I told my ex that I\u2019ll consider it later\u2014maybe after they\u2019re married and settled. But now, he\u2019s furious, saying I\u2019m being petty and selfish.

I\u2019m frustrated. I don\u2019t see why a name on some legal documents is such a big deal, but they\u2019re making me feel like the villain.

        "selftext": "I (22FtM) was staying at a friend's place a few months ago over my spring break. Let's call her Natalie (23F). Natalie and I have been friends for a while, but we haven't been able to hang out as much since she graduated last year and has been working. This was my first time seeing her new place, and our first time spending the night together (before anyone gets the wrong idea, there are absolutely no romantic or sexual feelings between us). Now, as a guy without a penis I am unable to enjoy the wonders of pissing standing up most of the time. STPs scare me and so I simply sit. However, when I shower I can pee however I'd like and it just goes down the drain and washes off my leg if I aim badly! I shower every night before bed and I basically always pee, it's just really satisfying for me. I don't really talk to my friends about my peeing habits, but my whole family pees in the shower as well and I just assumed it was normal. Last week, me and Natalie were hanging out with some of our friends. Somehow, we started talking about peeing, and so of course peeing in the shower came up. Many of my penisless friends agreed with me that it's so nice to be able to stand for once, and many of my penis-having friends even agreed as well. However, not everyone felt that way, and there was a bit of an awkward silence afterwards. Natalie approached me later and nervously asked me if I had peed in her shower, and I said yes. She got really quiet and the whole thing got really awkward. She kinda shuffled away and we sort of avoided each other the rest of the evening. Later, one of our mutual friends texted me to tell me Natalie was really uncomfortable to learn that I peed in her shower, and she was reconsidering whether she would ever let me stay with her again. I texted her about it directly and apologized, but she hasn't replied yet. So AITA for peeing in her shower? edit: who reported me to reddit as being in crisis im just trying to pee here \ud83d\ude2d",

        "selftext": "MMy brother and his wife have been trying to get pregnant but unfortunately she's had 6 miscarriages. That sucks, I know, I'm not discounting that at all. That being said she's a center of attention kind of person, she will shit talk other people all day long and try to make herself look like the best person in the room. If anyone else gets attention she tries to take it away from them, usually by putting them down verbally, or by getting another dog or cat. Most of the animals she has were obtained right after other people she knew got pregnant.  Well, wife and I got pregnant, discussed at length with how we should approach this, keeping my SIL in mind was the main topic of conversation. We didn't want to upset her but we also didn't feel like it was right to let her dictate our actions and make it impossible to celebrate the life that we're creating. So we made t shirts, announcing the pregnancy. Not gloating it, just announcing it.  Christmas time, we come over to my mom's place, do present exchange, then change shirts. My mother was very happy but I could see the look on my SIL face, upset. She didn't say anything and just shut herself in the bathroom, then left early later on in the day.  Next day she sends this message to my wife.  To say I\u2019m disappointed, is an understatement. We have had conversations about how hard infertility is during the holidays, and how hard/debilitating it is. (bro) and I have lost 6 babies. Six. We have six dead children, (wife). Springing you\u2019re pregnant on (bro) and I like that was uncalled for and completely ruined not only mine, but (bro) Christmas. You could\u2019ve sent me a heads up text about this, so we had time to process this. And if your excuse is \u201coh I didnt want it to ruin the surprise for mom\u201d, you\u2019re wrong. It\u2019s a completely invalid fear. Because I would never ruin a surprise like that. Not only that, but you also saw how that affected me, and you wouldn\u2019t stop talking about it. You\u2019re excited, sure. But read the room (wife). I cant tell you how much that damaged our relationship, and honestly. I dont know how many holidays I\u2019m going to be there for now because of what you did. What you did was completely selfish and careless. It showed me you really don\u2019t care about me. And honestly, had we gotten a heads up text, I\u2019d be happy for you. But right now? I\u2019m not. You both ruined Christmas for us. Idk why you thought that was such a good idea. You also had AN ENTIRE HOUR to do it before we got there. I had to leave early because I couldnt stand being there for another minute in a house that I didnt feel loved in.  The only time we talked about it was when my family was asking questions, due date, gender, etc., it's not like we were talking about it throughout the day.  Am I the asshole (are we the assholes) for having decided to do the pregnancy announcement anyways?",

        "selftext": "My (27F) older brother and SIL (both mid 30's) just welcomed their first child a year and a half ago, after YEARS of trying. After many failed attempts, SIL was told that she wouldn't be able to conceive due to a medical condition she has, they finally got pregnant.  Since having my niece, the baby has been the center of attention at EVERY family even we've had since she was born. Birthday's, wedding's, family get togethers, you name it. Now don't get me wrong I LOVE my niece, but it can get to be a little too much when my SIL goes on and on about how long they tried to conceive, complications they've had, miscarriages they've had etc. Like a little TOO much info. Many family members have commented on how it's a little bit excessive, but no one has said anything because they don't want to sound like an AH.  Anyway I'm getting married in the spring and my brother and SIL approached me last weekend about having my niece be the flower girl. Now my fianc\u00e9 (35M) has two children (10M and 6F) from his previous marriage. His son is one of his groomsmen while his daughter had asked to be our flower girl when we told them the news that we were getting married a year ago, as it's something she always wanted to do, so of course we said yes.  So I explained this to my SIL when she asked me about my niece. She asked if my step daughter can just carry my niece with her? I said I don't think she'd be comfortable with that considering she's 6. She then asked why I can't give that role to my niece, and allow herself to carry my niece down as the flower girl? I said no because I already promised my step  daughter. She then starting going off about how my lack of effort to incorporate my niece is disgusting to her. I should honor her in some way since I know how long and hard they tried for my niece.  Now I may sound like an AH for this but I kind of got fed up and snapped and said  Incorporate my niece how? By the time the wedding comes around she'll be 2 years old. The ENTIRE family already knows your story about how long and hard you guys tried for her. What more do you expect me to do to honor her? She started crying and said that clearly I don't love my one and only niece and I'm letting her down. I said of course I love my niece, and obviously she's going to be involved in pictures and stuff. But I'm not going to let my step daughter down by giving my niece a role she's too young to remember anyway.  Well now SIL and my brother are pissed off with me for not letting my niece be flower girl, and are running around telling the rest of the family I don't love my niece. My mom had been trying to stay neutral but thinks my step daughter would understand if I explained to her I need to give that role to my niece. I'm firm in my decision though, and my fianc\u00e9 is thankful that I didn't let his daughter down. AITA for not allowing my niece to be the flower girl?",

        "selftext": "So my friend 20f and I 19m have been friends for a few years and she recently got engaged. A week ago I got a dm from her for a small costume party she was hosting as a celebration for her getting engaged. I asked if there was a theme and she said there wasn\u2019t. I\u2019m a cosplayer so I had a lot of choices. I didn\u2019t want to rock up in an anime cosplay, so I thought it would be funny to go to an engagement party as the Corpse Bride. I arrived at her house yesterday and everything seemed normal. A few people complemented my costume and I was having a lot of fun. After ten minutes my friend\u2019s fianc\u00e9 walked out in a black tuxedo and announced this was actually their wedding. Apparently my friend saw a video of someone doing this and wanted to do the same. He asked us all to go to the back yard for the ceremony to begin. I went straight to him. I asked him if I should quickly go home and change my outfit and that I would get back before it started. He told me it was fine since I didn\u2019t know this was the wedding. I trusted him and followed everyone outside. They got married and everything seemed good. The reception was just in their house again so everyone just walked back inside and picked up where they left off. I tried talking to my friend and celebrating with her but she kept making excuses to not talk to me. I assumed it was just because she was tried from the big day and wanted some alone time. I didn\u2019t bother her after that and the party soon ended. I got home and half an hour passed when my phone started getting notifications. I checked and it was my friend texting me. She was cussing me out and telling me how I ruined her wedding. I was really confused and asked what I did. That only made her more angry. She told me it was basic knowledge not to wear a wedding dress to a wedding. I reminded her I had no idea it was a wedding and that I asked her now husband if I should change and he said it was fine. She didn\u2019t respond, but I got a text from her husband. He asked why I would tell her he said it was fine. I told him he said it was fine. Then he said how I should have changed anyways and it\u2019s my fault that the two are now fighting over this. I\u2019ve tried texting her that I wad sorry and if I had known I wouldn\u2019t have done it. I woke up today and saw her and her husband have blocked me on everything. So, AITA for not changing out of the wedding dress when I found out it was actually a wedding? Edit: I am a guy. I cosplayed the character Emily from The Corpse Bride and had blue paint all over. I\u2019m also Australian and I\u2019ve never heard a costume party meaning fancy.

        "selftext": "When my daughter was 14, wife and I decided we would buy a car for her to use on her 16th if she proved herself to be responsible, got good grades, etc. There would be a contract of sorts to ensure we were all on the same page. The stipulations were continuing good grades, good attitude, she could only bring one friend with her somewhere (to begin with), we had to know where she was, and the obvious two: don't drink & drive, and don't text and drive.  We made it clear that **we** were buying the car, but it was for her to use. We got the car, a 2012 Honda Civic. She has a summer job right now, it's summer break so she's out doing stuff with her friends, etc. In a few months she will be off to college. Everything was going swimmingly. Until someone on that NextDoor app started posting pictures and videos of bad drivers in the area. And lo and behold, my daughter was posted with her face down as she texted and rolled through a stop sign. Once with her face down in her phone at a stoplight. I was livid. My wife was the one who showed it to me. We found out there were more instances (from her Instagram Stories) and we decided... no. Wife and I up and sold the car. We didn't lose very much in the process, except of course our daughter completely came unraveled. It's so unfair, I didn't hurt anyone, everyone's doing it, how am I supposed to get to work, what about when I go to college? Well, we said no, it's not unfair, you hurt us by being a shitty, irresponsible driver, no, not everyone's doing it, you can walk, ride your bike, or take the bus, and as for college, you don't need the car to get to and from classes, and again, ride your bike or walk. She tried to play the how can you send your daughter to college without her safety in mind? card and I said Well, well, well, now you're concerned about safety? and she just up and screamed.  This has everyone in our life up in arms and divided. Her grandparents think we're being over the top and awful, that grounding her would have sufficed. They've threatened that THEY will buy her a car again if we try to send her to college without one.  The car is already sold, so there's no going back. I think what we did was absolutely correct, that actions have consequences and we would be in the wrong to pull back from that. In terms of her going to college? Well, she made that choice. She had a car, it came with certain stipulations, she disobeyed us, and now she pays the price.  So AITA?",

        "selftext": "My son Aiden (23) moved back in with us upon graduating college as my husband wanted. My husband's original plan was to have Aiden live with us for free, but stay home and help with his disabled younger brother (16). Aident started complaining about needing money and wanted to find a job. My husband was against this and even offered to double his allowance but Aiden was growing tired of staying at home. So he began looking for jobs here and there for over a year but non of his job applications came through. He'd just apply and they never get back to him. We were confused by this til recently, I found out that my husband was behind all the job applications being cancelled. He'd wait tol Aiden applies then he proceeds to cancel the application by impersonating him and using his email. I blew up at him for this but his justification is that he's just trying to make sure that our younger son is cared for by Aiden and said that Aiden has been big help and him getting a job will affect his care for his brother. I went ahead and rented an apartment for Aiden and told him to stay there til he finds a job and starts paying for it himself. Aiden was hurt upon knowing what his dad did. My husband was livid when he found out. He called me unhinged and said that I was separating the boys and teaching Aiden to become selfish and care more about a job than family. He also said it was huge decision for me to rent an apartment without even running it with him. He's been giving me hell about it and is calling me a terrible mother for encouraging Aiden to be selfish and selfcentered. He said I needed to see and understand why he did what he did. [Edit] few things to mention: (1) My husband says that since he and I have health issues then we could use Aiden's help. (2) When I suggested outside help, my husband refused saying he won't ask anything from anybody and that his son is his problem and no body else's. (3) I used money from our joint account to pay for the rental apartment. My husband said it was wrong and that it was a major waste of money since we deal with medical bills consistenly.",

My brother 'Chris' (M) and his wife (F) have a 3 yro son who everyone calls miracle or rainbow baby. He came after several failed pregnancies that lasted for years.  When they found out that my nephew was included in the no children rule; they tried to convince me to make an exception for him. Chris told me his son is a miracle baby and his presence at the wedding will bring blessings for me and my fiancee. I refused and said no, the wedding is childfree. His wife kept sending my fiancee pics of my nephew when he was months old (what that mean??). I told them no, and to stop. My brother told me this might cause a rift in our relationship, I again said no and explained that the wedding is childfree. He asked again and pointed out how his baby is different since he's a rainbow, a miracle baby. I again said no and explained that the wedding is childfree. They brought it up when they visited at my home and I knew they weren't going to stop so I'd made flash cards in advance with the phrase the wedding is childfree, period and pulled them out and started slowly showing them the flash cards one by one in this order:  - The wedding (with a sticker of bride and groom).  - Is Child (with a sticker of a baby).  - FREEE (with a sticker of a \ud83d\udeab sign).  - PERIOD (with a huge, black dot sticker).  They both were stunned. I asked if they get it now and Chris had lost his shit. His wife had already grabbed her stuff and walked out. Chris called me an asshole for doing this and said that I disrespected him, his wife and their son who's my one and only nephew. He rushed out after we argued. My fiancee saw the whole thing and thought that it was funny but my parents and Chris are livid beyond measure. They're telling everyone about the amount of disrespect and mockery I had displayed towards them and I'm being told to fix it now.",

        "selftext": "Backstory: I (43f) have 4 kids. El (22f) Katie (17f) cam(15m) isla (5f) and I'm also currently pregnant. Me and my husband (50m) started adding to college funds every month for each of our kids pretty much as soon as we found out we were pregnant. I won't say the exact amount but my husband has an excellent job so it's more than most. We never told our kids because it just didn't feel necessary. El got pregnant when she was 16 and ended up dropping out of school. I was very disappointed but I understood. However I was under the impression she would return later, but she has no plans to. The dad stuck around and now they have 1 more kid (3) and one on the way. They are engaged but don't plan to marry until they can afford it. They were doing okay financially for a while but due to the market right now they've been struggling because El can't get a job since she doesn't have a diploma so we've been loaning them money. Katie is a senior and  just got accepted into college, we've been setting everything up and obviously she knows about the fund now. Katie and El were talking and she was telling El about the school and El asked how she was planning on paying for it, Katie responded my college fund I was in the room while they were talking and this made me panic. We had just planned on splitting it between the remaining four since we knew they were going to college. El asked me if they all had one and I wasn't going to lie, so I said yes. She got really excited and went to call her fiance and tell him the good news. I was confused and told her she couldn't have the money, she asked why and I said it's for school. She got upset and left my house.  The next day I get a call from El, she was crying and begging me to let her have the funds so she could finally afford a down payment and maybe even a wedding. I told her she could have the money if she went back to school and whatever money was keft over she could use for whatever she wanted. She got super mad and started yelling at me and saying it's her money. I told her that it was MY money and those  were my conditions and she hung up. Now we are being harassed by her fiances family (they aren't as fortunate as us) calling us assholes and a lot of other names. Saying it's all gonna go to waste if she doesn't use it, were setting her up for failure, etc.. Now I'm wondering if I'm the asshole because my dad said we should give her the money as we saved it for her after all. So am I the asshole? UPDATE: ( I think this is within the rules, please correct me if it's not)My daughter came over on Thursday and we were able to work things out. We both apologized and had a long discussion. She will be getting her GED and will be going to a trade school in exchange for me giving her whatever money is left over. She hasn't decided which one yet, but it will probably be cosmetology. Her fiances family has apologized. We also decided to pay for small wedding ceremony and reception as a gift.",

We've also been busy moving into our new home that we purchased together (30% of his savings + 70% of mine). I have to say that saving up for this house took most of my savings and prevented me from enjoying the things I love spending money on. My fianc\u00e8 sat me down yesterday to talk about his 'groom speech'. he talked about few points but what made me upset was when he asked if I would be okay if he mentions the house we bought and say that HE was the one who bought it. I was a bit taken aback, I asked why and he said it's just a confidence boost during the speech and that's it. I said I didn't feel comfortable with the idea because I think that it's unfair not to acknowledge the fact that I'd sacrificed so much to be able to buy the house. I reminded him of how much I contributed but he said this doesn't change that it's our house so it shouldn't matter to me if he said he bought it himself or we both did. I refused because then people will always think the house was bought by him which is something that will never change no matter how hard I try to prove that I contributed 70%. He got made at me and said that I was really overthinking this whole thing and making a big deal out of it. We got into an argument and he started yelling saying it's just one favor he's asking me to do and yet, I'm making this ridiculous, small request my hill to die on. He's basically sulking and now he's out and refusing to answer my calls so basically he's started the silent treatment til I cave in. AITA for making this my hill to die on? [EDIT] My fiance comes from more humble background and money has always been a struggle for him and his family. It's become obvious how insecure he can be when it comes to money, especially when he compares how much I make VS how he makes. I've never made him feel as less than and he has never took advantage of me in any way and so his recent request really cut me off guard to say the least.",

I found a 2nd job recently and he's been having me pay every time we go out. When I protest he'd say he's going through a rough patch and is seeing how much help I cam offer.

He asked me if I brought enough momey, I said why and he told me that he told his parents that I'd pay for their meals. I said why would I and he went on about his parents going through a rough patch just like him. I said I'm sorry this can't be a coincidence! he asked what I meant and I told him that I would not be paying. He insisted, I refused and said no. He then leaned back and said well, you're here, so not much of a choice you have anyway while laughing like it was funny. I silently got up, took my phone and purse and walked right out. He was shocked he started shouting after me to stop and wait but I didn't. I went home and he called me enraged saying that I did a horrible thing walking out on him and his parents, while I could've just paid. I told him that their unfortunate financial situation isn't my problem and that I wasn't obligated to pay for their food. If they couldn't pay for their meals, then they should not go out. He got offended and said and I qoute you're making money a priority just like my ex did then went on about how disrespectful my attitude was and how I made him look small infront of his parents and forced him to lie about why I wasn't there when they came. We've been going back an forth about it til now. He's mad and is refusing to speak to me til I apologize. AITA? I feel bad because his parents are lovely and I been doing my best to keep a good relationship with them.",

        "selftext": "My (39F) daughter (16F) has had a sensitive stomach ever since she was a kid. There are certain foods that will upset her stomach to the point where she's unable to stop throwing up. We've seen countless doctors, but so far nobody's been able to give us a clear answer. The only advice we keep getting is to identify all trigger foods and cut them from her diet. We have a pretty good idea of what those foods are: soda and other carbonated drinks, chips, cheetos, and other similar processed snacks, anything oily or fried and most sweets. Unfortunately, this is exacty the kind of stuff my daughter loves to eat the most. And as horrible as she feels after she has them, she still refuses to cut them out of her diet, which in turn led to her spending a lot of time in the hospital during the past few years. When she was little, it was easier to keep all these foods away from her because I simply wouldn't buy them. But now that she's older, I can't always be there to check what she eats. She eats the greasy pizza at her school's cafeteria, she trades her lunch with her classmates, she goes out with her friends and stops to eat at KFC and so on. And it always ends with her in the ER, crying and shaking because she can't stop throwing up. This was the case on this Christmas eve as well, when our whole family gathered at our place. And of course, among the many dishes at our Christmas table were some of her main trigger foods, like chips, soda, chocolate and sweets. Now mind you, these were far from the only foods available to her. We also had a variety of home-cooked, traditional dishes on the table, with ingredients that don't upset her stomach, like vegetables, meat, dairy etc. All of them delicious and well-seasoned - my daughter herself says she really likes most of these dishes.\u00a0 Despite this, my daughter chose to eat nothing but her trigger foods. I reminded her that they'd make her feel awful, but she said she didn't care, because *Christmas is only once a year* and she *just wants to live a little*. Well, this ended with her violently throwing up in the ER a few hours later. She had to be hospitalized for a few days and only just got out of the hospital a few hours ago. And unlike all the previous times when something like this happened, this time I chose to spend my Christmas relaxing at home with the rest of our family, and not in the hospital by my daughter's side. I kept in touch with her through calls and texts, and told her that if she needed anything I'd ask a family member to bring it to her, but I made it clear that I would not be visiting her during her stay. And well, my daughter didn't take this too well. She cried every time we talked on the phone, begged me to come over, told me how horrible I was for 'abandoning' her there all alone and so on. Most of our family didn't take my side in this either, and during the past few days I got called everything from 'a little extreme' to downright cruel and heartless. AITA, Reddit?",

        "selftext": "So, my husband (38M) and I (36F) are expecting our first child, a bouncing baby girl due in a few months. We were both over the moon when we found out the gender, but now things have gotten . . . complicated, to say the least. See, when we first started talking about names, the \u201cboy name\u201d was immediately decided: Stuart Jr., after my husband. No problem there, it\u2019s a classic name and carries family meaning. But, for a girl, things got murky. My husband suggested Stuarta. No, you\u2019re not having a stroke. Apparently, his logic is that since Stuart ends in \u201ct,\u201d we can just add an \u201ca\u201d to make it feminine. I tried explaining why that doesn\u2019t quite work, how it sounds more like a furniture brand than a human name, how she\u2019d be endlessly correcting people and explaining its origin. He\u2019s adamant though, says it \u201chonors\u201d him while giving our daughter a unique name. I\u2019ve suggested alternatives: feminine names that maybe share a similar sound or meaning to Stuart, names he\u2019s mentioned liking in the past, even just going back to the drawing board entirely. But he\u2019s fixated on Stuarta. Now, I love my husband dearly, and I understand wanting to honor family. But I can\u2019t imagine subjecting our daughter to a lifetime of awkward stares and endless questions about her \u201cunusual\u201d name. I also worry about potential bullying and the impact it could have on her self-esteem. So, Reddit, am I the jerk for refusing to budge on Stuarta? Is there any compromise I haven\u2019t considered? Help a soon-to-be mama out! TL;DR: Husband wants to name our daughter after himself; in a really, really bad way. I think it\u2019s terrible and will set her up for a lifetime of awkwardness. AITA? Looking forward to your thoughts and (hopefully) some sanity checks! Edit: Please, no suggestions for other \u201c-ta\u201d names. The man clearly has a theme, and I need to gently steer him away from it, not fuel the fire!",

Dad left money (inheritance) for me and sister and she used her inhertance to get new cars and renovate her houseI live with my aunt right now cause my brother inlaw didn't let me stay with my sister. I'm planning on using my inhertance money to pay for college tuition (I've always wanted to be doctor but haven't decided which branch yet). My sister & I haven't been close, it started after she got married to her chronically ill husband who was allowed to make backhanded comments about dad and mock his llness and make a scene at his funeral.only because he's ill and shouldn't be held accountable for his behavior.I've distanced myself But my sister kept visiting alot lately venting about my brother inlaws condition. He's been in & out the hospital for heart problems and in need for a surgery. She brought up my inheritance money several times but I end up cutting the conversation. She then straight up asked if I could help pay for her husband's surgery and she'd pay back in less than a year. I felt uneasy cause if I give her money from my inhertance which is a large amount then there's no gurantee she'll pay back before It's time to apply for college. I'm taking a year gap but I know my sister can't pay back that much and I felt I was risking my future. I refused to help and she had a melt down at my aunt's house calling me heartless, cruel with no empathy. She said that her husband's health should be a priority and I needed to help because education is nothing compared to someone's health and asked if I'd be happy to see her as a widow and my nephew with no father.My aunt suggested others pay but most of them cut my sister and her husband off. I argued that her husband's poor health isn't my fault after she kept blaming and guiltriping me. She kept crying and although my aunt decided to stay out of it she said that I should be prepared for permenant damage in my relationship with my sister if I don't help her now.  She's been sending texts and pictures of her family telling me this is what I was saying no to, a happy healthy family with a healthy husband and father. I cried and felt like I was being selfish not good aunt and sister. I asked my friend and he said let them sell the cars and all the luxurious stuff they bought to afford the surgery and warned me if I give them money I'll never get it back and may not be able to go to medical school.",

Context: I have a large family, I have 2 stepsisters (18, 20) and a biological brother (27) and also a biological sister (30). My fiance argued that the guest list should be cut short and suggested I only invite my immeditate family, I asked him to elaborate and he suggested excluding my stepsisters. I said no and got upset with him for implying that they're not family, he said well, This wasn't what I meant..I was just speaking from a technical angle, especially since I didn't include them in the wedding party like MOH and bridesmaids. So he thought they wereunneeded but I said they are wanted, and will always be wanted and included by me. Well, days ago, my stepsisters called saying my fianc\u00e9 cancelled their invitations and told them some lie about changing wedding location and telling them they won't be able to come. I was fuming, I went home and started screaming at him, He asked that I hear him out then explained he had no choice since we were required to shorten the list, and he just did my dirty work for me since I obviously was looking at the situation from an emotional angle and couldn't bring myself to disinvite my stepsisters myself. I called him a hypocrite cause he invited almost 6 of his friends who, as far as I know, aren't immediate family. I told him he hurt my stepsisters by going behind my back and excluding them from  y wedding which they've been so excited about. He got up from the couch and yelled that it's our wedding so my stepsisters feelings aren't really that relevant compared to H.I.S and called me controlling for wanting my way or the highway. He took his phone amd stormed out to see his friends. Some of his friends called to scold me for how I'm treating their brotherand then went on about how rude I was to suggestthat their brother disinvite them from the wedding just because I don't like them and called it a you problem. My fmil called and is wanting to sleak to me, he probably told her what's going on and she is probably going to ask that I apologize for yelling.",

        "selftext": "My wife and I are both 32. Since we got married and moved in together five months ago, my wife has simply not made nearly enough food for me. This is not a kind of situation where I'm constantly agitated at her for incompetence or anything like that. I would be more than happy to microwave a burrito. I would be more than happy to whip up a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.  But I can't. My wife has, every single night of our marriage, done the same thing: she'll make me a tiny dinner. I'm talking like a Chinese chicken salad with 30 grams of chicken and ten leaves of lettuce arranged fashionably with dressing. When I finish eating, I'm still hungry because for a 230 pound man who works a physical labor job, it's not enough food.  At first, I tried to openly communicate with her, but she always took it horribly. She would adopt a thousand-yard stare, and then begin talking about how incompetent she is and how she can't even make her husband a proper dinner. I'd try to calm her down with Oh honey that's not the case! I just eat too much or Don't worry about it. I can make a bit more. I'd try to be overwhelmingly positive. It never helped. She would always just get incredibly disappointed in herself, cry, and/or take it out on me. Then she would make the same exact amount the following day. After the communication route failed, I tried to eat her dinners as-is. It became hard to sleep at night due to hunger and I lost seven pounds in the first month. Eventually I figured out my own system. On my way home from work, I started swinging by a fast food restaurant and getting myself a burger. I would basically pregame her meals with some more calories. I figured it was win-win, as what she doesn't know can't hurt her, and I could have my fill of food. I would eat on my way home, walk in the door, pick at the salad or quinoa or homemade Mac and Cheese she made, compliment her for her delicious cooking, and later dispose of the wrappers discretely.  Two days ago I was on my way home and in line at a drive-through. My MIL was coming out of the restaurant. She ran over and greeted me. I asked her in a humorous way not to tell her daughter where she saw me because she'd take it badly, and she agreed, but then she narced on me anyway. I got home to a furious wife who demanded details. When I provided the truth she got extremely angry and looked legitimately hurt. I'm not good at handling confrontation and feel like I betrayed my wife in some way. Was I wrong here?",

        "selftext": "This will be my first year in college. When I got accepted, the 1st person I told was my uncle. We\u2019re very close because he took care of me when I was little because of my parent\u2019s crazy work schedules. Anyway, my grades were good enough to get me in but not enough to get me any scholarships. That means I\u2019ll have to take out loans for tuition and work for my expenses. When my uncle found out, he said I should just concentrate on school instead of working but my dad (his brother) said that money is tight right now so my parents can\u2019t help me out as much as they want to. My uncle has investment properties all over the place so he said it\u2019s not a big deal for him to buy another one near my campus, which he did. Then he had contractors renovate the house so emerging in there is brand new. He even had them install a bay window in the master bedroom just for me and I got to pick out everything else like the carpet and counters. He told me he wants me to concentrate on school and not work. Instead, I can be his landlady and rent out the other 3 bedrooms and keep that money to fund my expenses. I have a group of friends who are attending the same school so I made a deal with them. Studio apartments are going between $900-1500 (not including utilities) around the campus with the expensive ones being closer. My uncle\u2019s house is one street over from campus so I can literally walk to class everyday. I\u2019m charging my friends $700 per room or if they double up, $350 per person per month and split utilities evenly. They all jumped at the offer and no one asked any questions until recently when one of them asked me how much the overall rent was. I was honest and told them about my uncle and our deal. That blew up in my face because now everyone of my friends are calling me greedy for charging them rent then pocketing the money. We\u2019re all in a huge fight and they all want to either pay nothing or \u201cthrow a couple hundred\u201d in for utilities.  I cried to my uncle but he said now that I\u2019m an adult, I need to make my own adult decision. He\u2019ll stand by my decision. I don\u2019t want to lose my friends but I don\u2019t want to disappoint my family with bad grades either. I thought I was being fair with rent but literally all of my friends are calling me a greedy AH. Update: Thank you for reading my post and giving me advice. I went to my uncle, this time without crying, and told him some of the advice given on here and asked him for his advice. This time he didn\u2019t tell me to make my own adult decisions and told me he was waiting for this conversation. This is what we agreed to do. I texted all of my friends (former?) and told them because of the arguments and hurt feelings, we can no longer live together. My uncle offered to work out a lease for me in the beginning but I refused because these were my friends. Because no one signed a lease, we didn\u2019t have to break any. I was worried about them suing but my uncle said that the law in our state requires anything to do with real estate be in writing. Unlike other situations, real estate deals cannot be oral so I\u2019m good. This time I took him up on the offer of creating a lease for me to have new tenants sign. We spent the morning researching rent prices and making ads. My friends and I made the agreement at the beginning of summer. Now that there\u2019s only a couple of weeks left until school starts, we found almost nothing within 3 miles of campus. There were some options further out but nothing was cheaper than $1,200 for a shared room and that was in an old house with window A/C units and 5 miles from campus. When the house was being renovated, my uncle had central air and heating installed. We came to a rent price of $1,300 and placed ads in several places including FB. Within an hour, I got a dozen messages. It\u2019s 4 pm now and I literally have over 100 messages. Many of them don\u2019t even need to see the house in person. Based off of the pictures and location, they want to submit their application today. Some even offered to send me the deposit and 1 person said her dad will pay me the full semester amount today. My uncle gave me some advice that was exactly what you guys said. Never mix money with friends or I might lose both and never tell anybody my business. He told me not to lie, just keep quiet. Thanks again and have a great weekend you wonderful people!",

She then tried to get on my good side and started overly praising everything I do and sometimes even copying me like that one time when she LITERALLY dyied her hair purple just like mine and when everyone pointed out how ridiculous she looked, she actually blamed me and accused me of trying to make a joke out of her.  So, Anyways! My husband and I took 2 weeks off work to go visit some places out of the country - tourism in other words. Thing is I was the one who saved up for and arranged for the trip (my husband was responsible for booking the tickets). My husband's mom wanted to come along and threw temper tantrums when I said no. She called, texted, sent people to talk to me into letting her come, even threatened to call the police and make some complaint up to get us to stay if she can't come. My husband said we should just take her but I told him he was wrong to tell her about the trip in the first place. He gave me an ultimatim. said he wouldn't go if she can't come and I told him I'd gladly call his bluff which made him take his words back and say FINE! I will tell her to stop it because we won't take her. Things got quieter, suspeciously quieter. the day of the trip came and we got to the airport at 2pm. My husband was walking ahead of me and was looking left and right like he was looking for someone. I asked him but he didn't respond. He lead me to the waiting area and first thing I saw was his mom standing there with her luggage . I froze in my spot, I felt a cold wave washing over me and I was fuming inside. She and my husband were hugging that's when I quietly turned around and started walking towards the exit. My husband followed me while shouting at me to stop. he tried to stop me but I told him off the harshest way possible. He tried to say I was overreacting and that his mom was there anyway and I should let it go and not mess the trip up for us. I told him he and his mom could still go and that I was going home. I went home and sobbed into my dog's fur for several minutes. turned out he booked her a ticket without me knowing. an hour later he came home yelling and raging about how pathetic and spiteful I was to walk out and go home and ruin the trip last minute. I told him he caused this to happen. he said that I was being so hard on his mom it's ridiculous. I refused to fight any more but he kept on berating me then called my family to tell them that the trip was cancelled and that it was because of me. My family said that I shouldn't have ruined it for myself and should've sucked it up and done my best to enjoy. Did I really overreact?",

        "selftext": "My boyfriend had to go to the ER after a accident, and he got a truly ridiculous bill back. I offered to fight the bill for her because I've done it before, and he said sure.  I went all-out, because honestly if we were out 5 grand, after insurance, that would fuck up our holiday plans pretty bad.  So I... - had him call the hospital and authorize me to handle his bill and access his medical records.  - got an itemized bill and compared the prices for each code to the fair prices - called billing to dispute the bill, but was told that billing only collects bills, I'd need to contact admin to dispute - bounced around a call center for hours trying to get someone who was actually qualified for bill disputes, and getting nowhere  - google and linkedin searched for the hospital board of directors and upper management  - got 30 emails of the most influential people at the hospital, plus the hospital's investors - every day would send a few emails, working my way up the chain, and writing an (increasingly long) email describing how they billed my client at 7 times over the fair price for services rendered, and how their billing department, customer service department, and the growing list of management I'd emailed, had failed to address the issue.  - escalated the emails until I was writing the director-level staff with the entire board of directors and a number of outside investors CC'd, asking for a written statement regarding their justification for billing at a rate 7 times higher than the national average, for commensurate services to what is available at other hospitals. And sternly laying out the failures to appropriately respond, at every level of the company.  Well, once I'd done all that (which was honestly only like 15 minutes a day) they reduced the bill... From $5000 to $26. Yep, twenty-six fuckin dollars.  Well, I told my boyfriend the good news, and he was at first overjoyed and blown away, like literally jumping up and down and hugging me and saying I was literally a Christmas miracle.  But then when he asked how I did it, I said it wasn't too hard, I just had to send a couple emails each day. He was curious what I'd said, and I handed him my phone.  He started to get stressed, and flipping back through other emails. Which there were like 60 of. He told me I went way too far, he was expecting me to dispute through their billing department or something normal and reasonable like that, not internet stalk every single manager and board member and investor and harass them into dropping the bill.  I was frustrated because I'd just saved us 5 grand, actually made it possible for us to afford a nice Christmas and save some money, and he was mad at me because I'd been a bit of a hardass?  I was furious, and he was also mad at me, saying he authorized me to dispute a bill, not basically threaten and harass a whole damn hospital for weeks.  AITA for how I got my boyfriend's medical bills dropped?",

        "selftext": " Hear me out, just read the whole text. So my wife, F (26) and I, M (33) been married for 2 years. I admit that she is a hothead and can be a bit much especially when shes mad at me. I take responsibility for any mistake j make like not cleaning the bathroom after the shower or filling her car with gas after using it. I even stand there and let her unload her anger and frustration on me BUT only at home and not in public. She tends to start arguing with me in public instead of waiting til we get home.  Recently she's been coming to my workplace to berate me over something I did the night before like not getting the stuff I said I would get or doing the stuff I said I would do. It's embarrassing and humiliating,iating and has been affecting my job to the point where I started getting a warning after a warning from my superiors who, I believe have been very patient and understanding especially when my wife makes a fuss at the office. Last week I was in the middle of a 2hr meeting and next thing I knew was seeing my wife barge in while yelling at me asking why I was keeping my phone turned off (I had to turn it off after getting warnings about I since she forbid me from turning it off). I was stunned, because my superior and co workers AND potential clients were there. I didn't even move my superior dealt with it and called security to get her out. My wide started arguing with him telling him she came for me then started urging me to get off my seat and tell them to back off. But I didn't I just watched as security escorted her out. It was horrible because I had a fear that my job was lost. She yelled at me repeatedly to get them to stop but she got kicked out eventually.  I got told she's no longer allowed there and that this was going to be my final, last warning. I apologized then went home. She was there waiting then yelled about me watching and doing nothing whole she was getting mistreated and kicked out. I finally snapped and said she was over the line, made a scene that risked my job over few missed calls. She started crying saying I still should've defended her after getting humiliated infront of my co workers but told her she didn't have to worry about it because she's no longer allowed there. She got more furious and went to her mom's to stay there.",

        "selftext": "I'm a 48-year-old man and my 19-year-old daughter has always been an independent thinker. I raised her to be independent and think for herself, which I've always appreciated. However, we recently hit a bit of a snag. She got engaged and decided that she doesn't want me to walk her down the aisle at her wedding. She argues that her mother and I don't own her, therefore we have no right to give her away. I feel hurt by this because we never treated her like an object or piece of property, rather we've tried our best to provide her with a wonderful life. Her stance seems extreme to me and despite discussions, she's refusing to budge on the issue. I respect her choices, but I feel she's disregarding our feelings completely. As a response, I told her that if she feels that way, then I won't be paying for her wedding. I don't want to come across as controlling or manipulative. It's true, I don't own her, I also don't owe her a fully-funded wedding. She can pay for her own wedding if she's insistent on this stance. I'm feeling quite conflicted about this. AITA? Edit: So, this isn't about making the wedding about me. Walking her down the aisle (while all eyes are on her anyway) and then sitting down is hardly making the wedding about me. It's about her attitude. She's had every opportunity in life so far, and to exclude us from this day is a spit in the face. It's a rejection of everything we've done for her, sacrificed for her, given her. It's selfish. 90% of wedding traditions and symbolism had roots in things we don't acknowledge today. Should we stop all of them? The rings, the flowers, the dress, the wedding party, the cake, the flower girls... a father walking his daughter down the aisle has been about respect, pride, love and honoring the father/daughter relationship for far longer than it was about ownership. Independent thinking does not mean rude or selfish thinking. Being an independent thinker does not give someone the license to disregard or disrespect the thoughts, feelings, or perspectives of others. Independent thinking is about maintaining the ability to think critically and form one's own opinions while remaining respectful and considerate of others. It is a balance between asserting individuality and engaging in meaningful and respectful interactions with others. Edit 2: Also note that our relationship is not so weak that this disagreement will ruin our relationship. We are still close with each other in spite of this. There is zero chance of her not inviting us to her wedding (regardless of who pays for it) or cutting off contact and withholding grandchildren. I feel sorry for anyone who suggests that as a possibility. Likewise, there is zero chance of us refusing to go to the wedding or cutting her out of the will. In life, people disagree - even strongly - it's a natural part of life. We don't end life-long relationships over it.   UPDATE: For all the YTA people out there, I've decided to give my daughter a gift in the same amount as her older sister's wedding cost. She can use this for whatever she wants. For the NTA people out there, thanks, most of you get it. My daughter has also agreed to figure out a way to include us in a way that doesn't involve giving her away. We are still in the early wedding planning stages, and she is almost 20. So she will likely be 21 before the actual marriage. Thanks for the concern, I guess. I approve of the groom-to-be if that matters to anyone. We disagree, but that doesn't mean it's a relationship-ending event. My daughter is laughing hilariously at all of you that are saying she will disinvite us from the wedding or cut us off from grandkids. I just feel sorry for you all. THAT is petty and manipulative, and regardless of what you all say, I've raised her better than that.",

        "selftext": "I (F23) have been dating my boyfriend \u201cJake\u201d (M23) since our freshmen year of college. In our last year of undergrad, we decided to rent an apartment together. We split everything 50/50, including utilities, groceries, and rent. We continued living together in the same town as our college after graduation, but recently, we both got jobs in Chicago and we are currently living downtown. My dad works in real estate, and he has multiple investment properties. My dad generously allowed me to live in one of his properties rent free, but he said that my boyfriend would have to pay him $400 a month for rent. My dad is very protective, but he has been nothing but kind to my boyfriend. My dads reasoning for making my boyfriend pay rent is that he wants to be sure that my boyfriend is with me for me, and not because he will have a free place to live. (Keep in mind, if my dad was renting this apartment out to tenants, he would charge $2100 a month for rent. Very ritzy building in the middle of downtown Chicago).  My boyfriend is mad at me because he asked me for my half of the $400 for rent, and I explained to him that I will not be paying rent. My dad is only charging him. He says that we have been splitting rent for the past 2 years so why would we stop now?  Our rent in our college town was $1200, so we were both paying $600 a month. Our apartment in Chicago is significantly nicer and he is paying $200 less a month than what he was in college.  Is the idea that my DAD doesn\u2019t charge me for rent, but charges my boyfriend so crazy? Should I suck it up and pay half because I can afford it? EDIT: Jake and I still split utilities and groceries 50/50, and when we go out on date nights, we switch off who pays for it. If he pays one week, i\u2019ll pay the next.",

        "selftext": "My husband (58 M) and I (56 F) recently met my son\u2019s (24 M) girlfriend for the first time. He\u2019s been crazy about her. Apparently they\u2019ve been dating for a year before he decided to have her meet us officially.  What he\u2019s told us about her all seems great: she just got her degree, was enjoying her job, family-oriented, etc., I\u2019m honestly just glad he\u2019s happy with her. My husband and I don\u2019t think he\u2019s ever been this into someone before, so I feel pretty bad about what I did.  Last weekend, he brought her over for dinner. By now we\u2019d been anticipating meeting her with how much our son has been gushing about her. How perfect she is, that she\u2019s \u2018the one\u2019, in his words. They ring the doorbell. We open the door. She looks exactly like her pictures, which is a great start. My son is grinning ear to ear - another great start. We invite them in. She accepts my hug and a firm handshake from my husband, and then she opens her mouth:    \u201cI\u2019m the one your son puts his penis in.\u201d    To be frank, I was appalled. I expected my husband to laugh (both he and my son are jokesters, and as annoying as it can be I love it) but THIS was just too much for me. Maybe I\u2019m reserved, but of all things she could have shared about my son she told us THAT. One look at my face and my husband knew how much I disapproved.  Maybe I let my expectations get too high, and it\u2019s unfair to have them, but I reiterate: of all things to say to her boyfriend\u2019s parents - whom she\u2019d never met - she chose THAT? My son was amused at first but when he noticed my reaction his face dropped.  I felt like he\u2019d sold me the full package, everything he\u2019d always been looking for in a girlfriend. I was too disturbed by the visual it put in my head, and it translated into anger. I told her to get out, and I wanted to say more about how gross it made me feel but I fortunately left it at that. My son didn\u2019t want to go, insisting I give her another chance, but I was too fed up and uncomfortable by this point. Even my husband, who\u2019s enjoyed his fair share of raunchy jokes, wouldn\u2019t let up.  They left and I immediately felt guilty. This was something my son had really looked forward to and I feel like I took that away over a dumb joke. I tried calling to apologize but he hasn\u2019t responded. My husband thinks she\u2019s the one who should apologize. I\u2019m considering giving her another chance, but before I do, was I the AH? EDIT: I should clear some things up:  My husband had no part in my reaction, I did the kicking out, not him. I don\u2019t want him taking the fall for this. He said she should apologize, but I\u2019m not expecting an apology. Sorry for the confusion.  My son lives in a nearby state, it can take about an hour to get back to where we live. He also hasn\u2019t dated anyone seriously for a while, maybe a couple of years. He told us before that he wouldn\u2019t bring anyone home unless he\u2019s sure he wants a future with her. We\u2019ve been asking to meet her ever since he told us about her, but he wanted to be ready.  The comment about her looking like her picture shows my age, sorry for that! He\u2019s only shown us her photos she\u2019s sent him as he apparently didn\u2019t have any of them together (he hates taking pictures and apparently she\u2019s always teasing him about it). I don\u2019t think he\u2019d ever lie about who she is, but it\u2019s just a parental concern I\u2019ve subconsciously had. I felt the same way about my daughter\u2019s (then) boyfriend when we first met him. I don\u2019t have any criteria that either of my kids\u2019 spouses need to meet, I just hope my kids are happy with them.  What I meant by her being \u2018the full package\u2019 was indicative of what he\u2019s told us about her. As his parents we have a good idea of what he looks for in a partner and she checked off everything based on what we\u2019d been told. And on top of everything (aside from what she said) her appearance was how she presented it to be. Again, we aren\u2019t strict about appearances, it\u2019s just a relief to have met someone for the first time and they look like what you\u2019d expected. My husband said that I was worried about \u2018second-hand catfishing\u2019 if that\u2019s even a thing lol. I guess it shows how anxious I was about this. Also thank you for your comments and rewards! I\u2019ve had a fee people reach out to me personally, too, thank you for that. Regardless of where you stand, I appreciate it. I personally think everyone needs some room for improvement here but I\u2019ve done my part to make amends and I\u2019m waiting on my son to call me! I\u2019ll be sure to give an update about how it goes. UPDATE: Thanks for reaching out everyone. My son got in touch with me. His girlfriend agreed to try again. We all met at a restaurant my son and his girlfriend chose. The first thing she said was an apology for what she said. I apologized for my reaction. We hugged. It was nice. She then explained how my son had convinced her a joke like that would land well, and that she wouldn\u2019t have said it if she didn\u2019t think we\u2019d like it. According to my son, she was reluctant to open with any jokes at all, but they came up with that one together on the way over. You guys were right!  She\u2019s a really sweet girl. She\u2019s actually very mature, too. I see why my son likes her so much. My husband and I really like her, we told our son to bring her when he visits. We look forward to seeing them again. Overall, I\u2019m glad we could start over. On the right foot this time. Thanks, everyone for your input.",

        "selftext": "My wife and I have always dreamed of celebrating our 40th anniversary with a luxurious vacation. Just the two of us, reliving the romance of our early years. We had it all planned out for years now and were excited beyond words.\r  \r  Enter our adult daughter Jane. Jane and her husband got wind of our plans and promptly invited themselves and their two children (9F, 5M) along. I originally put my foot down and told them this trip was just for us which upset her some. But my wife has a hard time saying no to Jane, as she is the youngest of our children and our only daughter, and she didn't want to hurt her feelings, so she reluctantly agreed to let them join.\r  \r  I wasn't thrilled about it at the time, but I wanted to make my family happy, and I knew my wife was also okay with the idea of a family trip even if she was heartbroken we wouldn't get our romantic trip. We went along with it. The place we were originally going was not child friendly so we changed course and decided on an all inclusive family friendly resort. We paid for the resort and our grandchildren's plane tickets. Jane and her husband only had to pay for their own airfare.\r  \r  Here's where things get complicated. As the vacation got closer, I started having a change of heart. I realized that our 40th anniversary was a once-in-a-lifetime milestone, and I wanted to honor it in a way that was true to our original plans. My wife and I might not be able to afford a trip like this again for quite some time and it's something we always wanted to do.\r  \r  So, without consulting anyone, I switched our tickets last minute to go to the romantic destination that my wife and I had originally planned for. I did not tell Jane or her husband. I didn't even tell my wife until the day before our flight left, which was a day before Jane's flight left for their vacation.\r  \r  It wasn't an easy decision and I feel guilty about it. But I wanted our 40th anniversary to be the special, intimate celebration we had always hoped for.\r  \r  We called Jane after we landed to tell her and she was extremely upset to say the least. She seemed of the idea that we were going to look after our grandkids so she and her husband could have alone time and now that I abandoned her they would have to do it all themselves. I hung up on them when my son in law started shouting and my wife and I enjoyed the rest of our trip.\r  \r  They came back the same day we did but have not answered any of our texts and Jane seems to be ignoring me. My wife told me she vastly preferred our trip to the family trip we would have taken but she still doesn't like how Jane is mad at us and wants me to apologize. I'm not sure I want to after learning Jane and her husband were using us for free babysitting and a free trip but I feel like I should just to keep the peace.\r  \r  Am I the asshole for changing our trip destination last minute and leaving Jane and her family to fend for themselves?",

        "selftext": "Yesterday while I was making lunch I heard a really loud sound, as if the ceiling was falling or a bookshelf had fallen.  My husband (41M) and daughter (17F) were out, the only other person in the house was my son (16M). I was pretty sure he was in his room, which is at the opposite side of the house from the kitchen, so while making my way there I checked every room and everything seemed in order.  I knocked on my son\u2019s door and called his name, no answer. I must have knocked/called 3 times before trying to open the door which was locked.  At this point I was getting really freaked out, thinking that maybe he tipped his wardrobe or bookshelf and it had fallen over him and he was passed out on the floor. I was basically screaming his name, no answer.  I have no idea how I did it. I just threw myself the door and it broke. Now, clearly the door was already weak (I\u2019m thinking termite?) but, yeah, it broke.  My son was fine. He was freaked out about the door but fine. The sound was his TV with the volume at the max, apparently. And he didn\u2019t answer me calling because he didn\u2019t want me bothering his movie. His words were \u201cYou were screaming like a harpy and it was annoying, I was trying to watch the movie. Fix the door.\u201d  I said no. I wasn\u2019t going to fix it since to \u201cfix it\u201d I would have to buy a new door and doors are expensive. And as soon as his dad got home he would remove the door entirely as it was too broken to just stay there.  He got really mad. Said it\u2019s his \u201cright\u201d to have a door, he deserves his privacy. I said he had a door and while I was the one that broke it and it was a consequence of his actions, so if he wanted a door he would have to buy it (I know he doesn\u2019t have the money for it right now). Until then, no door. He can change in the bathroom. He said fuck you, I said he was grounded.  AITA about the door? My husband is fine with it, says only I know how scared I was, so only I can know the appropriate punishment. I\u2019m now terrified that if anything happens where we really need to reach my son, we won\u2019t be able to. But I have calmed down since and I\u2019m wondering if maybe I\u2019m the asshole.",

So my (35M) wife (32F) is pregnant. She\u2019s due in 2 weeks and i am beyond excited because this would be my first child and I\u2019ve always wanted to be a dad. Yesterday, we were in bed together, talking about our baby. All of a sudden she jumps up excited with a huge smile on her face. She told me to stay on the bed because she had a surprise for me. She went into our closet and grabbed a box. It was decorated with ribbons and bows so I assumed it was a gift for me. She handed it to me with the same big grin on her face. It was obvious she was excited to see me reaction. I asked her what it was but she just kept on saying \u201copen it open it!\u201d I opened it and inside was a blue onesie with the name \u201cbartholomew\u201d in cursive stitched on the middle. Now, I had agreed that I\u2019d let my wife name the baby since she was the one giving birth and I felt as if it would be something really special for her so I trusted she\u2019d name my son something at least normal. I asked her what it meant and she said \u201csurprise!! That\u2019s going to be his name.\u201d She sounded so happy and enthusiastic so I knew she was serious. I busted out laughing to the point of tears. I honestly could not believe she was going to name our son that. What the hell kind of name is \u201cbartholomew\u201d???? She got really silent and started tearing up. When I noticed this, I sat up and stopped laughing. She snatched the box off me and stomped back to the closet. I asked her if she was serious and she said yes. Apparently she\u2019s decided to name our son after her grandfather who she was very close with before he died. I told her that she should think about this because it\u2019s an \u201coutdated\u201d name. She started yelling at me saying I was judging my son before he even came out the womb. She stormed out and is now staying at her moms. I honestly can\u2019t believe she\u2019s serious. Her dad called me yelling at me because apparently she\u2019s told on me. I\u2019ve been called immature and a joke so far. I\u2019ll probably just apologize but there is no way in hell I\u2019m calling my son by that outrageous name.

        "selftext": "Me (25m) and my wife (23f) are having our first child together. She is currently 9 months pregnant and could give birth anytime in the next couple of weeks. The only major fight we have had throughout her pregnancy happened a couple days ago, and it was about what we were going to name our kid.\r  \r   It all started when we found out the gender of the baby. We didn\u2019t do a gender reveal and decided to find out the gender at one of her checkups because we didn\u2019t want to spend time making two lists of names then have to get rid of one after. So after we found out we were having a boy we sat down together and made a list. Almost all of the names she suggested were normal, until the one that caused me to write this post. She suggested we name our son Mune. She told me the name was from this movie she watched when she was younger and that it always stuck with her. I told her the name was a little out there and he would get made fun of for it. She claimed he wouldn\u2019t and we started going back and forth trying to decide whether to add the name to the list or not. Eventually she agreed to keep the name off the list, we picked some that we liked, and I thought that was that.\r  \r   Later on in her pregnancy her mom decided to throw a baby shower as it was her first grandchild, and my wifes pregnancy was almost over and we hadnt celebrated once. It was fine for the most part until we started to open the gifts. Most of them were normal baby things like diapers and bottles, until we got to her moms gift. My wife opened the gift bag and pulled out a blue handmade blanket. It seemed normal enough at first until my wife unfolded it and low and behold there was the name Mune written on the blanket. When I saw it i was pissed but didn\u2019t want to cause a scene so i stayed quiet. After that reveal I had family members come up to me and ask me about the name and why i hadnt told them. I didnt know what to tell them as i didnt have a clue about this either and just had to embarrassingly tell my family that, which pissed me off even more.\r  \r   Once the event ended and me and my wife went home I started to question her about the name. She got defensive and told me that it was a good name and that i was overreacting about it. I brought up the earlier points and told her it was a stupid name for a kid and if she wanted to name something Mune so bad she could use the name for a dog. She got upset and called her mom to come get her. After she left she called me and told me she wouldn\u2019t be coming back for awhile. Everyone ive talked to about this has said im not the asshole, but now that my wife has been gone and ive been thinking about it I feel like I could have handled the situation better. Aita?\r  ",

        "selftext": "My wife and I have 3 kids. Tina (19f), Jason (15m) and Ally (14f).Late last year, my SIL passed away unexpectedly leaving our niece Jenny (4f) orphaned (her father is not in the picture). My wife and I, of course, agreed to take her in.  It has been a huge adjustment for all 6 of us. Tina and Ally had to start rooming together. Ally is OK with this, but Tina has complained since we brought our niece home. In fact, whenever Jenny does anything typical of a 4 year old that Tina dislikes she will loudly and rudely comment that THIS is why I am childfree and will never have kids!  A few weeks ago there were big changes in our childcare coverage and now we lack coverage for about 2 and a half hours mon-fri.  Jason and Ally both agreed to take 1 day of the week for babysitting duties, when we asked Tina to take on the other 3, she refused stating she is child free and means it.  I told Tina that if she won't pitch in to help the family by babysitting, then she was no longer welcome to live in our home rent-free. I told her what we would be charging for her room and board and she had a meltdown She did a lot of yelling and screaming but when she realized I was serious about kicking her out if she didn't pitch in, she agreed to take on the 3 days of babysitting.  Our relationship has been tense. Tina says I am not being fair because she has to take 3 days when Jason and Ally only have to take 1 day each. I explained it is because they are still in highschool and both are involved in after school activities while she takes college classes part time and online while only working weekends. Also because she is an adult and the other two are not. She has also called me sexist and says I am discriminating against her beliefs.  Am I the asshole for forcing my adult daughter's hand in this? ETA: We can't really afford an outside babysitter right now. This was the reasoning behind charging my daughter room and board. I currently pay her school fees, car payment, car insurance, phone bill, all of her groceries, health insurance, and utilities. I was charging her less in room and board then what her lifestyle costs monthly.  If she doesn't want to babysit she is free to stay here IF she pays the amount we said in room and board. She would have to take on more hours at work to do so though. EDIT 2: Thank you reddit. Looks like the consensus is NTA. I appreciate everyone who voted in support AND for those of you who voted YTA, I appreciate you too! You've given me some valuable insight into how my daughter may be feeling.  A couple things: My daughters monthly expenses are generally $1200+ a month. A big portion of this is taken up by her car payment and car insurance ($590) and her grocery bill ($300) as she follows a vegan diet the rest of the family does not. We were planning to charge her $600 for her room and board. That was the amount we needed in additional household income for everyone to maintain the same quality of life and afford to hire an outside sitter (which would cost as $800-$900 a month) There is no child support or government assistance. My niece and SIL were not US citizens at the time of her passing. My niece's biological father is incarcerated in their home country. He won't be out until my niece is pushing 30. We took on a fair amount of debt (five figures worth) in order to facilitate the international adoption. Sending niece back to her home country was never an option as it has high crime, high poverty, and lots of government corruption. Her mom died while visiting the states. If I had a time machine and could go back and do it all again... Maybe I'd soften the blow to my daughter and explained things differently. However all my ultimate decisions would have been the same. Niece would still be adopted. Tina would still have to share a room. Tina would still have to either babysit 3 days a week, pay the $600 we asked her to, or move out. None of that would have changed or will change.  I love all my kids. I love my niece and she IS my kid too now. My wife, kids and I are all she has in this world now. While I understand that this is a frustrating situation for my eldest daughter (and my younger kids as well, but they are taking it in stride!) The mere fact of the matter is my niece has more NEEDS right now than Tina does. It sucks but sometimes families need to shift resources during family emergencies and crisis.",

        "selftext": "So I, 27F, am a black African woman. I'm living and working in Germany for a fixed period on secondment. While here, I became quite friendly with a colleague, 60F, and she invited me to her daughter's wedding. I was excited as I've never been to a white wedding. I asked if there was a dress code/colour scheme to adhere to since it wasn't specified on the invite. I was told the code is dress to impress. Bet.  Day of the wedding, I understand the assignment. I wear my traditional wear, which is really beautiful and obviously not German. The garment is green, so np problem there. Or so I thought. I get a lot of questions and compliments at the wedding, which I genuinely downplay because its not my day.  My colleague seems colder than usual but I pay it no mind since she's mother of bride and could be preoccupied. The bride is downright rude to me, but again i give her grace. I congratulate her and thank her for including me and I get a tight \ud83d\ude10 in response.  I keep to the edges of the room as the music isn't really my vibe, and I'm just observing how European weddings work. I leave around 8 (after 5 hours) and go home before the wedding finishes.  Monday I walked into whispers in the office, people actually strangely and more reserved than usual. An office friend pulls me aside and fills me in: brides mother is fuming. My outfit was too extravagant, OTT and inappropriate. I drew attention from the bride and commandeered the room: I was rude and disrespectful. She's told people all about it, apparently.  I approach MOB and ask to speak but she says she has nothing to say to me. I ask her why she has sth tk say everyone else about me but not to me, and she calls me an insolent child. I explain to anyone who scolds me that this was my first white people wedding: I specifically asked what to do wear and followed the guidelines. Where I'm from, there's no such thing as outshines g the bride - weddings are a fashion show and a chance to wear your best and brightest clothes. They told me this isn't africa (which was racially coded) nd people here have manners. I laughed and told that person to go to hell, so she's telling people I lack remorse for my behaviour.  I'm wondering if I really am the asshole though? Edit: the dress inspo I showed to my tailor is now on my profile to help you.  Edit 2:  I'm about to board a flight. Someone told me to go back to my country so I'm doing just that \ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06 Thanks for the feedback. I'm guessing not the asshole but could have inquired further/done research - fair.  Some of yall are so pressed about the WP wedding - it literally means it's the first wedding I've been to where the bride, groom, and wedding party are white. It's really not that deep.  Thanks for the engagement and see ya \ud83d\ude0a ",

        "selftext": "New to reddit, please bare with.  So I (21, guy) live with my childhood best friend (22, also a guy) and have done for 2 years now. Up until last week, things were perfect between us.  However, he recently got a new girlfriend (23, lady) and she honestly seems absolutely great except for one thing; she seemingly has a complete aversion to knocking. She and I have quite a lot in common, and I actually like spending time with her. However it bugs the hell out of me when she just barges into my room without knocking first. Now, she's never walked in on me doing anything untoward; I'm usually just chilling on my bed or studying at my desk. However, on at least seven seperate occasions now she's done it first thing in the morning to ask if I want coffee. I sleep naked. Every time prior to the last one, I've been under the covers and she hasn't seen anything. I always point out that she *could* have and she just giggles and says but I didn't.  When she stayed over last week, in order to make my point, I intentionally slept on top of the covers. Sure enough, she barges in at 7AM, begins to ask if I want coffee and sees my you-know-what. She immediately backed out of the room and didn't speak to me for the rest of the day. My mate later pulled me aside and said I was bang out of order, accused me of deliberately exposing myself and pointed out that I'd threatened to do it before (I literally just said okay but what if I had no covers and you saw everything before). They're now framing this to others that I'm some sick creep who intentionally got naked and lay in wait of her because that's how I get my rocks off, and I'm kinda seeing how it came off that way. AITA for doing this?",

        "selftext": "[Update here.](https://www.reddit.com/user/Remarkable-Use-8439/comments/10s5t37/update_aita_for_missing_an_actual_emergency/) My best friend (31m) and I (27m) have a tradition of taking a yearly weekend trip together that's phone-free. We've been doing this for a decade now. These weekend trips consist of us staying in a suite and exploring the city, not traversing the wilderness so it's not like we're completely disconnected. Still, we liked to keep one on hand for navigation and emergency purposes, and it would usually be Friend's phone that we brought along. Friend and I left for our trip this year two Fridays ago to make use of the long weekend. This was the first time I've gone one on of these trips since my wife and I moved in together, got engaged, or got married. However, we were dating for the last two years worth of trips (2021 and 2022), and she seemed fine during that time. I would just tell her I was going to be busy for the weekend and she'd leave me alone. I understand that there are different expectations once you get married, but I didn't expect for the 180 in behavior. My wife all but demanded I take my phone as well in case she needed to get ahold of me despite her having Friend's number. I let her know I had arrived and immediately after that she was texting me and asking me how things were. Then again, asking me another question when I didn't respond to the first one. I eventually muted our text conversation because I was sick of the phone buzzing. She called me a few hours later and asked why I wasn't responding to her texts. I reiterated that this was supposed to be a no phone weekend and kept the call short despite her trying to drag out the conversation. She called me once more after this. When I answered and found out it wasn't an emergency, I simply turned off my phone. The calls then started coming in for my friend and he followed suit. We spent the rest of the weekend with our phones off until the drive back on Monday. I called my wife and informed her when we were about 30 minutes away from my place and she was furious. She said that there ended up being an emergency (her sister got into a car accident that won't affect her long-term, but still resulted in broken bones) and that I had just ignored her the entire time when she 'needed me.' I told her that I was very sorry to hear about her sister, but it wasn't my fault she had essentially forced my hand into cutting off means of communication. She went to stay with a friend before I arrived home that night and has since came home, but she's still fuming. AITA? EDIT: I'm politely asking everyone to stop making harmful accusations about my friend and the nature of our relationship when we were younger. It's making me uncomfortable, and not in the 'I'm having an epiphany' way you guys are hoping, but in the 'you're jumping to incredibly crude conclusions about someone I love and trust based on a tiny snippet into our life.' EDIT 2: Thank you for all the kind messages. I just checked them expecting more anger but instead have found lots of compassion. I appreciate that so much.",

I met the love of my life. We decided to tie the knot. From the beginning I told my parents how I am worried my sister will ruin another special moment in my life. My mom told me over and over again it would not happen. The day of my wedding. I received a voicemail from my mom saying they couldn\u2019t come because my sisters dog was sick and she was upset. I was hurt, my best man however is a jokester. He took my phone then went to my fianc\u00e9 and asked if he could post a video of our wedding as a gift? On social media. She loved his idea. I had no idea about it until I came home. Our honeymoon was at a lake side cabin. No cell service. The post caption was \u201cMy best friend. He is an amazing person even if his parents NEVER showed up for him.  video was still pictures of us next to her parents, me on the dance floor, cutting the cake. Where you would normally see both parents in wedding pictures. The sound behind the video was my moms voice mail explaining how they couldn\u2019t come because my sisters dog was sick. I came home a week later to hundreds of messages.Family members from both sides insisting I take it down. I was told my sister hasn\u2019t stopped crying. My mom is refusing to leave the house.

        "selftext": "****UPDATE POSTED IN MY PROFILE**** Brief backstory: About a year ago my last remaining grandparent passed away and my father inherited all assets, including a house. I had been saving for a nice down payment (at least 50%) so I could have a lower mortgage payment each month, thus allowing me to save money for travel. When my father inherited this house, which he had no interest in moving into yet, he offered to sell it to me for slightly below market rate, with the caveat that he and my stepmother could eventually move into the basement apartment. I agreed, because they're both incredible people who are not at all invasive and would give me my privacy if they lived there. So I paid a 60% down payment, financed the rest, and moved in.  Present day: About six months ago I started considering renting out the finished basement apartment. It has two bedrooms, one bathroom, a living room, and a small kitchenette (sink, fridge, microwave, but no oven). A friend of mine said his brother was moving to my city and needed a place. He's a brand new teacher and doesn't make great money, so he needed a place that wasn't expensive. I offered to let him rent my basement for way less than market rate ($650) which would include utilities. He readily accepted and signed a year long lease. Well a few days ago he asked if he could start paying the landlord directly instead of giving me rent money each month. I was under the impression my friend had told him I own the house, so I was confused and I told him we don't have a landlord and that I'm the owner. He got very upset and screamed at me for lying for over six months and taking advantage of him by making him pay so much in rent. For the record, an apartment similar to the one in my house would be well over twice what he's paying me, closer to three times for something as nice. He asked how much of my mortgage he's covering and I said Why does that matter? You're getting a nice, quiet place to live, access to a full kitchen and laundry room, and you're paying an amount that you can afford. My personal finances aren't really a factor here. He stormed out of the room and slammed the basement door. He's still not speaking to me. I asked a few other friends and some family members, and most said I'm wrong for having him cover my mortgage payments. Only a few say I'm in the right. So AITA for having my roommate cover $650 of my $775/month mortgage? ETA: He has a lease so I won't be evicting him over this alone. If he does any damage or becomes hostile, I'll look at the eviction process. But for now, he will remain unless he chooses to break the lease (which I'd allow him to do if he wants).  He also didn\u2019t bother to read the lease before signing. The lease clearly states I\u2019m the homeowner. I didn\u2019t trick him or keep info from him. He simply didn\u2019t read what he was signing. I didn\u2019t get the house for almost free as some people choose to believe. My father sold it to me for about 75% of its value, more or less as an advance on \u201crent\u201d he and my stepmother will pay when they move in here in a few years. We already agreed they won\u2019t pay monthly rent but will contribute to utilities and groceries at that time. I also made a 60% down payment so I have quite a bit invested, as well at paying about $1500/month out of pocket for taxes, insurance, maintenance, utilities, etc.",

They've done stuff like forcing him to play chess 4 times in a raw, secretly slashed his tires to see if he'd fix it himself like a man or get help like those lazy guys, They'd asked him questions like what joke he'd like to tell his future MIL, his opinions on abortion, jesus, gender equality etc. They also tested his fishing and hunting skills, overwhelmed him with hypothetical scenarios to test his decision making abilities/mental strength. They kept calling him slow and soft but he has medical condition (asthma) but they think he's making 'excuses'. I demanded they stop, but dad said this is just typical stuff men challenge each others with and said that I was ruining the fun.  Last week, They took Tim on a 3 day trip and hid his inhaler, he left them and returned in 7hrs and told me, I was seething after he said they admitted to hiding it as a challenge, I exploded on them when they returned. Cousin asked if little timmy ran to me to tattle. I yelled that all 4 of them are uninvited to my wedding. My brother freaked out saying it was a prank and they were going to give it back, Dad said they'll apologize if I insist but Tim will have lost the little respect they'd gained for him and in their eyes will always be the soft college kid who's not up for the challenge. I called him and the others awful then I left.  My cousin is begging that we talk, my uncle has been quiet, but dad is so mad and now he's getting mom involved to get me to reconsider this decision.

He really is a wonderful chef and all our friends enjoy the dishes he brings to parties. Whereas I will admit I don't know my way around the kitchen and have never taken the time to really dive into it. This is fine since he cooks, but his meals usually include too much heat. He cooks with a lot of spices, sauces, and peppers. I've asked him time and time again to tone it down since I can't handle the heat. Or at least add those last so he can still have them but my dish will be fine. He says this will ruin the dishes and they won't come out as flavorful and be really lackluster. And that added the spice at the end ruins the whole balance of it. I finally snapped the other night and yelled at him to stop making hot dishes I can't eat and he told me that I was always welcome to cook my own meals if I wanted. I don't see why I have to cook if he already is making the meal, he can just add less spice to it. That will add so much more time to my night when he is already handling that chore. So AITA for yelling at him after him adding spice too many times to dishes?",

She was a single mom of three kids when we started dating, she had two daughters (now 10 & 12) and a son (now 16). I\u2019ve watched these kids grow up, I\u2019ve read the bedtime stories, done bath time, the first days of school, pta meetings, all of it. I very much consider them to be my kids, and they\u2019ve been calling me mom for almost 6 years now. My brother Ivan (28m) just had a baby girl with his fianc\u00e9 Sara (27f). I love my niece, and my kids adore their cousin. My kids have been the only grandchildren on my side of the family since Ava and I got together, and there\u2019s never been a moment where the kids and my wife were treated like they didn\u2019t belong.My brother is their uncle, my mom and dad are their nana and pop\u2014 the kids see my family as their family and I always thought that my family felt the same way about them. The kids and I were over at my brother's house just hanging out, and my parents ended up dropping by with gifts for my niece.Ivan laughed when he saw the toys and told our mom and dad that they were going to end up spoiling her rotten. My mom said since my niece is their first grandchild of course they have to spoil her. My kids were sitting in the living room with all of us and my youngest daughter looked hurt when she realized what my mother said. My son and my 12yo didn\u2019t fully react to it, but I could tell it bothered the both of them too. Sara spoke up and said \u201coh you mean first grandbaby, not first grandchild.\u201d My dad shook his head and replied that my niece was their first grandchild. I didn\u2019t want my kids to keep sitting there and listening to that so I handed my son my keys and told him to wait in the car with his sisters. When they were gone, I asked my parents why the hell they\u2019d say that my kids weren\u2019t their grandchildren, and my mom said they couldn\u2019t be their grandchildren because they weren\u2019t really my children. My wife and I were going to be hosting thanksgiving at our house this year, but I told my parents that if they didn\u2019t view my kids as their family, then they could just host a meal at their own house with their \u201creal\u201d family while I spent the holiday with mine. I left before they could say anything else to me, and my wife and I have reiterated to the children that they will always be my kids and I will always be their other mom, regardless of our DNA. My brother is pissed at me now because he thinks I reacted too harshly, and that I should try to see where my parents are coming from. My mom texted saying that she and my dad love the kids, but they still aren\u2019t their grandchildren, and she hopes that we can come to understand that because she doesn\u2019t want this to ruin my niece\u2019s first thanksgiving. I haven\u2019t replied back. I meant what I said, but I\u2019m worried that maybe I\u2019m reacting too harshly. ETA INFO: I adopted all three of the kids about 4 years ago, so they aren't just my parents step grandchildren. Even if I hadn't legally adopted them, they'd still be my kids in my eyes. Edit no.2: - My wife's parents don't have a relationship with the kids. When my wife came out, they pretty much stopped speaking with her entirely.- Their bio dad is not involved and neither is his family. He lost his rights to the children before Ava and I started dating. The 10yo has never met him, the 12yo doesn't remember him, and the 16yo wants nothing to do with him.- My parents wanted the kids to call them Nana and Pop. I didn't make the kids start calling them that.",

My ex and I were married for 12 years, and have been divorced for 5 years, we have three kids together who are now teenagers. My ex and I got divorced because we were young when we met and got married and we grew apart as people. It was a mutual decision, and we agreed our kids came first and have always coparented very well. This has been the case up until the last year when his girlfriend moved in with him. Previously we would do holidays and kids birthdays together, now when she is present they won\u2019t even sit near me at our kids sporting events. I have always been nice to this women, despite my kids expressing they do not like her and they feel their dad acts differently when she is around. My ex told me early on she wasn\u2019t a fan of me and felt I intimidated her. When I asked him for examples of how intimidated her, he said it\u2019s my fave, that I have resting bitch face and it makes her uncomfortable. My ex and her got engaged over Christmas and my kids were less than thrilled, my daughter especially. She feels her dad made a major life decision without even talking to them about it first. My ex called me yesterday saying he is giving me a heads up that I have a year to change my last name back to my maiden name as his finance is expressing her distaste and concern for her and I to have the same last name when they get married. I told him we agreed in our divorce that I could keep his last name until I felt the need to change it, and that is what is listed in our paperwork. I also told him I don\u2019t want to have a different last name than our kids. He said I\u2019m being unreasonable and refusing to see how this would make his finance uncomfortable. I told him I can\u2019t see it from her side because I am a grown up, and not an immature child like she is. He told me I could ask anyone about this situation, and everyone would agree with her.

        "selftext": "Update :https://reddit.com/u/Justanaunt2/s/VhlPPq6vGy I (F42) live with my husband (M45) and our daughters (F18 & F16). We live in a different city from our families due to work.  A few months ago my sister asked me if her daughter Kate (F19) can stay with us since she was starting college in our city. She was scared of her daughter moving away for first time, especially to a big city like ours.  I knew Kate from before Covid time and remembered her to be a smart sweet kid. I discussed with my husband and we agreed she can stay with us.  Kate moved in around two months back. She was fine, came home on time, let us know her whereabouts, no partying.  The issue was with food. She had turned vegan.  Normally I cook for my family. I cook just one meal for all. And we are all diary obsessed people. Milk for cereal, butter in pancakes, cheese in everything. Eggs were our staple.  Kate needed separate dishes altogether and we needed vegan substitutes for her. Since those are way more expensive, I told my sister she should give money to Kate so she can buy it. She stared telling me how family doesn't take money from family to feed kids. I told her I would feed Kate same as other kids but I won't spent excess money on her. She said thats fine.  Since her mom won't buy it, Kate started buying plant based substitutes with her pocket money. For dishes like pancakes, I made food for her using her incrediants.  But everytime I made a huge non vegan meal, she expected me to provide equivalent vegan meals. I drew line at that. I can't spend so much time cooking another meal. She said everyone else got to eat it while she was left with few stuff go eat. I told her she is free to cook for herself and she hated that idea.  It came to a boiling point last weekend when we had a barbeque dinner with friends. She got upset that her salad was very basic, (it was good only with chicken added) and had nothing else to eat. She complained and I told her she can cook for herself. She got even more upset at that and called her mom crying about how I didn't make any good meals for her and expected her to fend for herself.  My sister called me yelling at me how I didn't love her daughter and was intentionally excluding her. My parents are also taking their side.  AITA ?",

        "selftext": "So I (28f) am about 7-8 months pregnant and while I've thankfully not gained a lot of weight, my belly has grown a lot and I find that most of my underwear is too small and cuts into my sides/bottom of my belly. After a while I started getting a rash in the places where it was too tight due to friction I guess. So one day I was getting dressed and I was getting frustrated about the rash and the underwear being too small, so I figured I'd try on a pair of my husbands (29m) boxers. They're size L and too big for me, but OMG it was the most comfortable thing I've ever tried on in my life. Breezy and loose and even the places where I had the rash didn't hurt. My husband had already left for work for the day, so I decided to just borrow them. At the end of the day we both come home and I tell him that I borrowed his underwear and asked if it was okay to continue borrowing some until the baby comes (less than 2 months left) or at least until the rash is better. He seemed a bit weirded out but said it was okay. Fast forward a few days and we're going to bed and he flips out at me and asks me why I'm wearing his good bamboo underwear. I'm confused, but he points at the band where it says bamboo. Then he goes on a long rant about how his few pairs of bamboo underwear are the comfiest and best quality etc etc (I swear this is not an ad for bamboo underwear). I apologized and said I just picked the pair off the top just like I did the other times, but he was upset and said I wasn't allowed to borrow his underwear anymore. I said I wouldn't borrow the ones that said bamboo on them since it bothered him, but he just drew a hard line saying I should go buy bigger underwear for myself and stop stealing his. Now, I'm thinking this is probably more about how he actually doesn't want me to borrow his underwear, and he's using me accidentally taking the wrong pair as an excuse, but I'm not sure. So anyway reddit, AITA for thinking my husband should let me borrow his underwear? Or am I just entitled? Edit: due to character limit I had to remove some to make the edit, so I picked the parts people told me weren't relevant to the argument. I just wanted to thank everyone for sharing their opinions - this sure was a heated topic for many. My husband and I had a good time reading some of the responses, our favourite was the guy who said he'd kill anyone who touches his bamboo underwear. We agreed that it would be wise to buy some maternity underwear for me, that I can use after the birth too. Thank you all for the great suggestions! I hope you all have a lovely day! I am finally off to sleep :)",

I have not eaten meat since I was roughly 3-4 years old when I found out where meat comes from (spoiler alert: there were a lot of tears). This is no secret and everyone in my life knows and respects this - or so I thought.  Four nights ago, I was at a party and I will admit, I got white girl wasted. My friends thought it would be funny to feed me chicken nuggets as a prank. I checked with them before chowing down are these vegan? To which my friends replied yeah, they're sunfed (a type of vegan chickenless chicken). They tasted off to me but I figured it was just because I was drunk. I was wrong.  I found out the next day when my sister sent me a message telling me to check my friends Snapchat story. The story was them showing the nugget packaging, and then showing them giving them to me (including the conversation where I asked if it was vegan). The and then later them mocking me and pretending to be me when I found out I ate meat (things like fake crying and yelling the CHICKENS!!!). I took a screen recording of the video and took it to the police, on the grounds of food tampering, and now 3 of my (ex) friends are facing charges.  They all think that I'm overreacting to a 'harmless' prank, so Reddit, AITA? In my view, they took advantage of my drunken state, tampered with my food, and publically humiliated me. In their view, it was just a prank.",

I heard my wife scream HELP! So I ran over, and she was freaking out because an elderly women hugged our son, you can tell the women was harmless. The women's son came along and  profusely stating that she had dementia and she meant no harm, that she tends to view every child as her child. I said it was okay, and I myself apologized for my wife's overreaction. During this time I was not paying attention and my wife called 911, and called over security it became a huge mess for all parties because my wife was not letting the issue go. You could also tell the son was extremely embarrassed as was I. I was trying to relax my wife, but she was going on a complete meltdown rage saying that his mother should be in a home if she cannot keep her hands to herself. What if she got our kid sick, tried to kidnap him, got combative and hurt him. All of which I agree are possible outcomes, but I told her none of that happened so let's just leave it. Security states since the wife called the police we had to wait for them to show up, so they can file a report as per their store policy. About 25 minutes later police showed up and asked what happened and my wife explained everything, you can tell the police where like WTF is wrong with this women. I felt nothing but disappointment. Police took the statement and started laughing as they left. Gave the son of the elderly mom a fist bump and said sorry. My wife was upset I did not have her side, she was upset how I took the side of the son instead of her. I explained his mom was clearly sick, it was a harmless gesture and explained she was one that acted unreasonably. I did acknowledge her concerns, but nothing bad happened we could have just let is slide and went on with our day. She told me I failed as a husband. So we ran the story by our family and friends, it is a a 50/50 split. So my BIL said this would be a funny story for AITA, he frequents the sub. So reddit was I the AITA? Sorry forgot to add our kid is 19 months old. First and foremost thanks, secondly I just noticed I put overrated instead of overreacted. At this point I will see myself out, as a couple of posters suggested I asked my wife if she wants to share her side, at this point I am going to drop it, but if she wants to keep the civil war going that is on her. I will take the criticisms  and feedback to heart. Been a fun read though, back to my main and looking at BG3 subreddit. ",

About two years ago my brother, Greg (25M) married Cheryl (34F). Cheryl has a daughter from a previous relationship (Becca, 9F) who has several health conditions, including celiac and a severe dairy allergy that requires her to carry an epi-pen.  Last weekend I hosted a dinner at my house for my parents' wedding anniversary. I made a fancy five-course dinner and in addition to my parents, I invited four close family friends, Greg, Cheryl and Becca, and my sister, her boyfriend and their twins (both 8M). Because of Becca's food restrictions, I found a restaurant in town that specializes in gluten-free, dairy-free (as well as other allergen-free) food, and arranged for them to make a full meal for Becca that I could pick up in advance of the party. I have made a variety of speciality meals in the past (for example, keto meals when my friend was following that diet) and I like the challenge, but knowing how serious Becca's restrictions were, I didn't trust myself to make her meal. I have ADHD and get easily distracted, and if I even used the wrong spoon or didn't completely wash some flour off a bowl, it could make her incredibly sick.  I thought the take out solution was fine, but when I served the food, I saw Cheryl looking at Becca's plate with a stony face. For her part, Becca started eating and seemed fine. Cheryl whispered to Greg, and Greg asked if he could talk to me in the kitchen. When we got there he said that it was unbelievable that I couldn't be bothered to make something for Becca, that they'd been bragging about what a great cook I am to her, and that he knew I'd made keto, vegan, and other complicated kinds of food in the past; now she would feel left out because she didn't get to eat what the rest of the family was eating. He said that it was obvious that I didn't care about making his stepdaughter feel like a part of the family, and that they were leaving. Greg, Cheryl and Becca then left, which put a damper on the rest of the party.  I felt like I did my best at the time, but in hindsight, I wonder if I should have tried harder to make Becca feel included since she is a relatively new addition to our family. AITA?",

We have her for four days a week (M-T) while she's at her dad's Fri-Sun. From the beginning, Jane told me Emily doesn't need a second father figure as she has her dad to fill that role. I was only supposed to be a trusted authority figure in case she ever needed anything. I didn't mind and try my best to respect that boundary. She's a sweet child anyway and doesn't cause trouble so it's not like I have to discipline her. Her father is also a good dad. Emily's dad recently got married and his wife has two kids of her own who are at their place Wednesday to Saturday and at their dads' Sunday to Tuesday. Emily and her new step-siblings don't get along at all. They're always fighting and it's pretty toxic. Emily's dad asked Jane if they change their custody schedule to match his step-kids' to keep the children apart. It's not a big deal in and of itself because we don't live far from each other so picking and dropping is no issue and she can easily be dropped off to school no matter where she stays. The issue is my wife agreed to it without consulting me. Jane is currently doing a certification course for the next 12 months and they have classes on Saturdays from 9-5pm. She asked me if I can babysit Emily on Saturdays, but I can't because I play golf with my brother and sister on Saturday mornings from 8am-1pm. This has been our tradition from before Jane and Emily came into my life and I had told Jane from much before that this is important to me and my siblings. She asked if I can move to another day but that's not possible either because my siblings also have jobs and families of their own so Saturday was the best day for us. I told her she can hire a babysitter but she doesn't want to spend money when I can do it for free.  I told her that wouldn't work for me. She then got mad and said golf is stupid and I should put my step-daughter over my siblings. That pissed me off so I told her I'm not going to sacrifice my hobbies just so that she can have a free babysitter. For the record, I don't have anything against Emily. I've babysat her before and she's a good kid. If there was a family emergency or if it was an occasional occurrence, then yeah I would cancel golf for that day to take care of her but I can't give up something this important to me for 12 months continuous. She called me a selfish asshole and slept on the couch last night. So AITA?",

I (f21) as well as my 5 siblings (from 29 to 37 years old) have all been pranked on our birthdays and on Christmas and usually it\u2019s one or two gifts. This Christmas though, I was the only person to get all joke gifts. For example, I unwrapped a MacBook from my brother, but when I opened it, it was just some chocolate (which I don\u2019t eat so I gave it away) and the MacBook was actually given to my sister inside a bag she wanted. Another \u201cgift\u201d was what I thought was a book I put on my Christmas list was actually just the book cover put on a dictionary. When I asked my mom about the book she told me she gave it to my Sil This went on with each present my siblings or parents had given me. AirPods was just a charger block? Adapter? gift cards were used and had $0 balance, a card with Monopoly money, and so on totaling to about 12 joke gifts. I realized I went out of my way to get everyone something they wanted or they\u2019d like didn\u2019t get anything. At this point i was bummed so I went to the living room to watch tv with my boyfriend. At dinner they were all talking about how much they loved their gifts and when my dad asked why I hadn\u2019t said anything about mine, I said there wasn\u2019t much to say. Everyone but my boyfriend laughed and my mom said it was no big deal as everyone else also got some joke gifts. I told her every gift I got was a joke gifts and that the ones they got was also followed by the real one. My dad told me I needed to relax as I\u2019m making a big deal about it and I\u2019d have next Christmas to get the stuff on my list. Not wanting to go back and forth i told my boyfriend I wanted to leave and we can spend the rest of Christmas break with his family then go home. My family got mad and told me not to go and to just stay because it wasn\u2019t serious. I left and put my phone on do not disturb during the drive and by the time we got to bf\u2019s parent\u2019s house, I had several missed calls and texts from them calling me names like ungrateful, sensitive, and childish. They said I ruined Christmas and made my parents upset cause I left. The next day, I exchanged and opened gifts with my boyfriend and his family and one of the gifts I had gotten was the book I wanted (the book my mom pretended to gift me). I posted it on my instagram story and not even 0 minutes after posting it, my sister sent a screenshot of my story to the family group chat and they basically got mad at me for leaving and telling me I ruined Christmas over some presents. They told me I owe everyone, especially my parents, an apology because my mom spent new years sad because of my actions. Now I just want an outside party to tell me if I\u2019m TA here? Am I in the wrong for being upset about the gifts and for leaving? After reading their messages and sitting on this for a few days I\u2019m now feeling like maybe I was upset over nothing and need to apologize to them. *Gonna edit as there may have been some misunderstanding, my Christmas list didn\u2019t include expensive gifts nor was I upset I didn\u2019t receive expensive gifts. I was merely upset because of being pranked with everything I got and being the only person who didn\u2019t get a real present that is all. Another thing I\u2019ll address is I dint do anything to my family which would warrant them doing this. The last \u201cbig argument\u201d I had was with my sister which was over a year and a half ago. Thank you for the replies and I will try my best to reply to comments while I\u2019m at work. Editing once more to add I participated in joke gifts when I was a kid, haven\u2019t participated in the last 10+ years because I didn\u2019t enjoy it or find if funny (which thy do know). I will reply with more info if needed when I\u2019m on break or have time to reply. - and I am familiar with the term scapegoat but truthfully don\u2019t fully understand so I will research that as well.

        "selftext": "I F, 34 have been with my fiance M, 37 for 3 years. Getting married before the end of this year and recently moved in the house that I inherited from my mom. The house is in my name and it took a lot of talking and convincing from him to have his name on the title as well. Now honestly part of me doesn't think this is a good idea, at least not right now maybe after marriage? But anyway, I've decided to go ahead and put his name on the title so he could go ahead and start contributing towards mortgage more and light my burden a little bit.  We've made appointments, decided on which form of ownership we were basing this on. when it was time for me to sign the deed, My fiance stopped me and gave me a pen saying this pen was his lucky pen and told me to use it to sign the deed. I took it and tried to sign but turned out it was empty. He was like oh I must've forgotten while laughing and then pulled out his other lucky pen. I took it, tried to sign and that one too was empty. Honestly, seeing how he was laughing I figured he was messing with me but he swore he wasn't and pulled out ANOTHER one of his lucky pens. I tried that one too and it was empty. my fiance started cackling and I felt humiliated especially with how the gentleman next to him was staring. I got pissed and asked him what that was about and he said it was a prank. I asked really? Did you really think this was a time for pranks? He was like it's alright you can use a real pen now. I pushed the paper away and said you know what? Never mind because I no longer want you on the deed. He lost it completely saying we had a deal and I can't back out of it just like that, and that it was a stupid joke that I took too seriously. We had an argument and I refused to sign the deed at least not then and there.  At home he blew up again saying I was the one who delayed the process and that he already gave me a real pen and all I had to do was sign the damn paper and get it over with. He accused me of looking for an excuse not to have him on the deed and started the silent treatment saying there's nothing to say til those papers are signed. Did I really take this too seriously?",

        "selftext": "I f35 got engaged to my fianc\u00e9 Eric m37 2 months ago. He moved in with me and my daughter Zoey f13. Everything was going well til he started complaining about Zoey's cat which is strange because the cat is so sweet and quiet most of the time and so I had no idea what the issue was exactly. Anyways, he went from complaining about the cat to making demands about her. He gave Zoey a list of places the cat can/can't go, things she's allowed to touch, banned her from places like kitchen and sofa (Zoey's favorite place to cuddle with her cat). Zoey showed me this list and I had an argument with him telling him he needed to stop this because it was ridiculous. He ranted about this being his house too and how he expects things to change after we get married. Few days ago, I was at work and got a call from Zoey crying saying her cat wasn't in her room and in the house. I freaked out too and went home to look for her. Zoey and I looked for 2 hrs before a neighbor of ours brought her and told us that he saw Eric leaving her outside and getting in his car and leaving. I was surprised and quite angry. Zoey took her cat and went back inside. I immediately drove to my future inlaws home where Eric said he'd be. The second I saw him sitting with his family I went off and blew up at him infront of everyone. His mom asked what was happening and I told her her son got my daughter's INDOOR cat outside the house probably hoping for her to get lost. He argued about wanting me yo stop spouting nonesense and go home and we'd talk there but I refused. It got worse and I ended up leaving after his family flipped out at him. He sent a bunch of texts talking about the stunt I pulled infront of his family. He said that he didn't mean to leave the cat out but after checking the cams I confirmed it. He still insisted that I humiliated him infront of his family and tried to turn them against him. He's been staying with a friend and has stopped calling and texting. AITA for blowing up on him infront of his family? Here's some cat tax https://imgur.com/a/lOUovCh",

        "selftext": "I\u2019m going to be vague for privacy reasons, sorry.   I (33F) am the breadwinner of our household. I have multiple, highly specialized degrees for a niche industry. I make 200k+, with potential to get in the 600-M\u2019s range. My company has not been hit that badly by COVID, so most of us have kept our jobs, but we\u2019re held to strict standards.   My husband (36M) has a broad degree/work experience. He quit his job right before COVID hit, hoping for a better job in the meantime, and I was supportive. He spent a ton of time applying to various jobs, and finally landed an interview at Organization X.  This is his dream job, in almost every imaginable way (I can\u2019t be detailed). However, it\u2019s paying about 65k a year, which would be fine except this job directly puts my job stability at risk.  My company and this org. are adversarial, at best. My field is extremely secretive, and if clients discovered my spouse was working for a competitor, I would be permanently tainted. I wouldn\u2019t be able to get a job in the industry forever. I know this sounds like an exaggeration, but I promise you, it absolutely is not. It\u2019d be like if I worked in protecting the privacy of celebrities, and he worked for TMZ. If he tapped my car, got into my work devices, he could use that to advance his career, and any trust I have in this field will be gone. Even if I trusted my husband not to do that, my clients and company don\u2019t. Worse, b/c my background is so specialized, this is the only field I can work in.  I asked him to drop from consideration for this job, since if he got it, we\u2019d lose my income. 65k a year cannot support us in this city. Plus, he does not have to work for this organization. Even if the job market is awful right now, his background gives him access to a wide range of jobs, but I only have this one, niche field.  He was extremely angry, and said I was \u201cselfish and only cared about money.\u201d I told him that if he wanted to go back to school for an advanced degree or just be unemployed for a while, I would support him, but taking this job isn\u2019t possible.  He continued the process behind my back, and got the offer. He wants to accept it, b/c he says his career needs to take priority and that I wasn\u2019t being a supportive wife.  I feel so betrayed, and I\u2019ve contacted all relevant higher ups in my company to inform them. I notified them as soon as he got the interview, b/c it\u2019s better coming from my email than from a background check.  I told him he could decline the offer, w/me watching him physically decline it, or he could accept the offer and move out immediately. I would pay for him to stay two weeks at a hotel, and we would begin divorce proceedings. My company is willing to take care of all of my legal fees.  I feel fucking awful. I still love him. I moved decisively, b/c this was the best way to cut my losses, but it still hurts. He called me heartless and cold. It\u2019s true that I was prioritizing my career over his, but it felt like the only option at the time.",

        "selftext": "  I f32 gave birth to my son 5 weeks ago. My husband's mom has been camping in the living room ever since and inviting people over, making a mess in the house, etc. I said nothing because if I open my mouth, my husband would start scolding me saying his mom is there to help and I should be grateful. What I did was ignore her and focus on my son. I handle feeding, diaper change, cleaning, wiping. I only get a few hours sleep so my husband's mom isn't really helping with the baby. But I thought to myself well, at least she cooks for us!. Last night, I was in the bedroom breastfeeding my son. I knew I was late for dinner but I thought that my husband and his mom saved a plate for me. Once I got done with my son, I walked out the room and saw my husband and his mom sitting watching tv. I asked about dinner and my husband said it was probably on the stove. As I was walking towards the kitchen, his mom loudly said that she didn't save me any food. I was absolutely shocked I asked her why and she simply said Well, we didn't see you at dinner table so I thought you weren't hungry. I lost it and yelled that I was feeding my son OF COURSE I was hungry, I was actually starving!. She shrugged her shoulders and said it wasn't her fault I didn't show up for dinner but she knew damn well that I was with my son and hadn't eaten a thing in hours!. My husband asked me to not raise my voice at his mom but I told him that he saw what happened and didn't think about me being hungry and needing food. he lashed out asking what the fuck I wanted him to do and I said I don't know, maybe save some food for me? She defended him saying it was selfish of me to basically berate him for eating his dinner after working for long hours at the department. An argument ensued and I went inside the bedroom, packed a small bag for me and my son, called my brother to come take me to mom's house and my husband blew up at me as I was making my way out. We argued at the door and he told me that what I was doing was uncalled for and childish. I told him I couldn't take his mom anymore, he said I should be ashamed of myself for talking about her like that after she literally put her life on pause so she could help ME out. My brother came and I got into the car and left. He picked some food for me on the way and I ate like a hungry bear. My husband never stopped calling though. In his last text he called me nuts and demanded I return today but I said that I miss my mom, that I like it here in her clean home with her healthy food and would like to stay for a while. He's lost it and got his family involved accusing me of keeping his son away from him and punishing him over food.  **Edit...Ok, to those who are saying that I'm keeping my husband away from his son, I promise you that he has full access to him but chooses not to come over simply because he hats my mom and refuses to be with her in the same room. How long am I going to stay here??? There's no telling but at least I'm being pampered and treated like a princess by my mom, dad, brothers - heck, I couldn't get this treatment in my own home!. As for my husband, He can come over to mom's house if he wants to see his son so badly but I doubt he'll do it since he's a very prideful person and this might hurt his ego.** **one more question to answer cause a lot of people asked me to clarify. Yes, Department = Police Department. He's a police officer. I'm sorry if you got confused, but I thought it was clear.**    **Edit Ok, I felt sorry for him and decided to send him a couple of pictures that I took of our son sleeping and what was his respons? A long wall of text berating me left and right and claiming that I was rubbing it in his face that he can't come see his son because of you know what!!. He called me the b word which he never did til now and I'm shaken and so so mad right now because I really thought I was doing something nice and considerate after having sympathy for him. I've decided to get the rest of my stuff tomorrow because I need more time and space to be able to think about what he's done and said. I feel terrible right now but at least I got dinner for tonight, unlike when I was at my own home when his mom first came** **Edit. OH MY GOD, I can't even find a place to start with this. So he just sent me a picture of him and his mom cooking dinner in the kitchen (it's nearly 7 pm here) saying that he was repaying me for the pictures I sent earlier and that they were making dinner and they were not including me for real this time ?????? I just....Oh my God I'm literally laughing like, seriously, what is this? I'm truly speechless!. I haven't responded to this (yet) and I don't think I will because I'm so angry right now and may just regret the words that I say to him. I'm gonna put the phone on silent or something for now because I don't want them to ruin yet another night but tomorrow I'm going to collect more of mine and my son's stuff so I could stay longer at my mom's house. Thank God I went anonymous with this and I might update later if anything new happens. Goodnight!** **Edit. God I can't believe I'm back on here, but he just sent me a text saying he's only willing to come over IF I could get mom out of the house tomorrow, like literally have her leave her own house! He said it's just for 2 hours so he could see his son and also talk (he doesn't even know I'm coming over tomorrow to pick more stuff for me and the baby). I'm freaking out! Like absolutely no, not happening. I wouldn't dream of telling mom to leave her own house, that's crazy out of line request!!!. I'm not sure wether to respond or what I should say to him but I'll try to get some sleep then see how it goes in the morning!. I'm too tired to do anything but I Just wanted to put this here for those who just read my thread, I'll let you know what happens tomorrow. Aright!.**",

I already had a folded piece of paper out but he snatched it then started screaming at me about how I have no respect for his privacy and that I shouldn't be getting my hands on his things. I was genuinly dumbfounded I told him to take it easy I alwaye do this before laundry. He lashed out saying I had no right and should've come to him and asked him first because he was worried about important documents getting lost like the one I pulled out. I said important documents shouldn't be inside his pockets and asked to see the paper but he said he won't show me. I asked why and he said I don't get to ask him jack shit after I disrespected his privacy. I almost laughed because what privacy does he have in pockets? It wasn't like a stranger was digging into them.  He refused to speak to me and later brought a new closet with A LOCK and moved his clothes inside of it. I asked if he was serious and he said this will teach me to respect his privacy and deter my snooping. Then went back to not speaking to me. I'm genuinely confused, AITA?",

I asked where he was going and he said he & family were going to eat out but I wasn't invited because his mom assumed that since I wouldn't be familiar with the food and how to eat it it there at the restsurant, then it's better for me to stay-in and eat at the hotel. I didn't argue I just let him go then I packed and took the first flight home. He freaked out and called many times and when he found out that I went home, he blew up snd called me ridiculous and irrational to do this. Even said that I acted in an ungrateful manner and embarrassed him infront of his family after he literally begged to have me go on the trip. We argued and he started giving md silent treatment after he came home. Moreover, his family are indirectly criticizing me on facebook about what I did.  Did I overeact? Edit1 he didn't even mention what type of food they ordered. Edit2 the family didn't plan on having me come along but my husband, like he said begged them to invite me.

        "selftext": "My f25 husband's m30, brother (BIL) m33 moved in with us after his divorce few weeks ago. The problem I have is that he started barging in to the bathroom whenever I'm using it. He never knocks or anything. Another thing is that he only does this when it's me in the bathroom not his brother. I told my husband about what I'd noticed but he laughed it off and called me paranoid. It was embarrassing because his brother would see me exposed and it made me uncomfortable. My husband said he spoke to him and he apologized but did it again. When my husband and I got married, we promised to not have locks or lock each other out of any room. So the bathroom didn't have a lock. I was really considering getting a lock and I let my husband know that if his brother walks in on me in the bathroom one more time then a lock will instantly be installed. He didn't say anything. Well, Yesterday, BIL walked in on me showering. He knew I would be in the shower but barged in anyone claming he needed to pee. I had enough I went out and got a lock and installed it. My husband got home, saw it and blew up on me saying I voilated an agreement that I was part of and went against his wishes being uncomfortable with locks in the house. He demanded I remove it and *promised* and *guarenteed* that his brother won't walk in on me again but I refused.  He's been pissed about it since then and is giving the silence treatement. INFO I'm not close with my BIL, my husband is. I don't even talk to him that much and I barely even sat with him at any gathering before he moved in with us.   UPATDATE: So before I provide an update on this situation. It's worth noting that my BIL used to do this with the bedroom too but at least I'm not always exposed in the bedroom. So My husband came home and I told him the lock will not be removed til his brother leaves and his reaction was to try and remove the lock himself and tell me to quit acting childishy. what I did was not shout or scream but pack a bag and go to my mom's house for the next few days or so til this gets resolved somehow. On my way out I saw my BIL in the driveway smoking. He knew what the argument between me and my husband was about but instead of stepping up to fix it he offered to take me to my mom's house saying that my husband could use some space from me. This made me cry the whole uber ride to my mom's house. The reason I feel offended is because BIL tend to be hurtful when he talks about others. I did all I could to win his approval but he thinks less of me and thinks I'm childish just like my husband says.",

Since the cake has always been more for the kids than for my ex, I decided to just make him a small one since it\u2019s not like he eats cake anyway and I don\u2019t want my kids to think I dislike their dad. I told his girlfriend beforehand that I was going to make a small cake and she told me not to and that I couldn\u2019t bring it to the party. I told her I had to bring it to the party as that\u2019s when the kids would give him his gifts. I offered to come early and give it to him before the other guests arrived and then they could put it away and nobody else would know about my cake but she didn\u2019t agree with me and repeatedly told me not to bring it. I did take it with me in the end and now she keeps complaining to mutual friends that I did it on purpose to ruin the party and calling me weird for making him a cake after I was told not to. AITA?",

        "selftext": "This year I went to my fianc\u00e9\u2019s house for Christmas. It was my first time going, as we would typically go to my family\u2019s house instead.  I got a (rather pricey) gift for my fianc\u00e9 \u201cDan\u201d related to his hobbies, I got nice gifts for \u201cDan\u2019s\u201d parents based off of things I\u2019d talked about with them before, and I got a small pack of chocolates for each of Dan\u2019s other relatives (I didn\u2019t know them that well).  I wasn\u2019t expecting many gifts from Dan\u2019s relative\u2019s because I didn\u2019t know many of them that well, but I was certainly expecting more than I got.  At first, I was excited when I saw that there was a big pile of gifts for me. However, once I opened the first one it was just a piece of coal. Everyone laughed, and I just kind of laughed along thinking it was a gag gift and that the other gifts would be different. But every single one turned out to be coal. All 18 of them.  I started to get upset, so I cried and lashed out at Dan. But he calmly explained apparently this is a longstanding tradition in his family where they gift coal to newcomers who are celebrating Christmas with them for the first time. He explained that it\u2019s just easier that way since all the relatives who might not know the newcomer well don\u2019t have to stress over finding a gift, and it\u2019s a fun experience for the newcomer as well.  I told Dan I couldn\u2019t believe I skipped my own family\u2019s celebration for this and left. But now Dan and some of his family are blowing up my phone saying I embarrassed him in front of his relatives and that I made it awkward for everyone. So aita?",

        "selftext": "This happened a while back. My wife and I still talk about it every once in a while. She's on my side and most of our friends and family are. However when it happened it was like WW3 between us and her co-workers and others. Here we go...I've been playing the guitar for 22 years. I know guitar values and whatnot very well. I'm very into the guitar market. At my wife's old company she was hanging out with co-workers one day after work and she mentioned that I play guitar. A co-worker who I guess is very popular at work said that his dad passed away and he was selling his dads things. His dad had a guitar and asked my wife if I'd be interested in it. My wife texted me and I said to have him send me the info on the guitar and the price. The next day he texted me the pics and price. It was a 1952 Telecaster in mint condition. He had the original receipts which was crazy! (That's how I knew the date). I asked what he wanted for it and he said he looked up Telecasters online and he thinks $4,000 is fair. I texted back, I'll take it for $4,000 and went to pick it up. The guitar had no sentimental value to him at all. Here's the issue at hand. The guitar was/is worth approximately $50,000 depending on the buyer and I knew it. When I got the guitar I told my wife the price and what it was worth. She was floored. Fast forward two weeks her co-worker tells my wife he just found out what the guitar was actually worth from a family friend and wanted it back. She said, well he really likes the guitar and he knew it was worth $50,000 which is why he was floored you offered it to him for $4,000. He really likes it and I doubt he will sell it back, but you can ask. (Probably not the smartest thing for her to say, but she was caught off guard and it's not her fault or problem). He contacted me and asked to buy it back. I said that it's not for sale. He then said I scammed him and he was going to sue me and take my wife to HR for being a part of the scam. Which was nuts, but he actually did contact HR. They were cool about it and said it's not their problem. It's between him and me. Over the next few months he made things very uncomfortable for my wife at work. He would bug her constantly about it. She eventually had to go to HR for harassment and they actually let him go (She complained twice and he was warned and didn't stop). He's contacted me several times about it so I got a restraining order for harassment too. I blocked him too. I haven't heard from him in about a year. AITA? UPDATE:  Well this post blew up way beyond what I was expecting. It looks like I was voted Not The Asshole. There's over 5000 comments. I couldn't read them all, but I did read a lot. Just to clear up some things. I left somethings out because I didn't want it to influence opinions and really wanted it to be about me buying a guitar at significantly lower market value vs the people in the story. I did include the fact that the guy was harassing my wife at work not to make the guy sound bad, but because I thought it was relevant to the story. Here's some specific details I chose not to include: The guy and his dad were not close at all. So those people saying he was grieving and I took advantage of him, that is 100% not the case. When I went to get the guitar he was telling me he hadn't talked to his dad in six years and was actually annoyed he had to deal with a funeral. The dad bought the guitar new and never played it. Luckily it was stored in a closet and not in a basement or attic. There's no issue with the wood or electronics. It plays like a dream and I couldn't be happier. I am not selling the guitar to the son or anyone. It will be with me for a long time. I'm in my 30's so maybe in 30 years it will find a new home. I would have MAYBE considered giving the guy more money or giving him one of my guitars to sell on his own, but I decided not to do that after he left a terrible voicemail on my phone the day he found out the real value. He demanded it back like he was entitled to an object he sold fair and square, called me a POS, called my wife a POS and said he would do bad things if I didn't sell him the guitar back. And to those people who say they would have told the guy the real value. That's a load of horse shit. If you went to a garage sale/estate sale and saw an item worth $5000 priced at $50 there's not a snowballs chance in hell you would walk up to the homeowner and tell them they mis-priced it. You'd buy the item and then tell all your friends and family what a great score you got! Don't even kid yourself like you wouldn't do that. I don't feel bad about buying an awesome guitar at a steal of a price. I was curios what others would think and it looks like I'm not the asshole so thank you reddit. I can play the guitar with zero guilt now. Not like I felt guilty before, but now my feelings are justified.",

        "selftext": "  I (F30) have been with my husband Ted (M34) for 4 years and we got married 2 years ago. His family and I haven't really gotten along too well. They're rich and are all about image. I only see them on occasions but that's when the drama is at it's highest rate. Last Christmas Ted & I traveled to spend Xmas with them and it was awkward for some reason. After we went back to the hotel his mom sent me a list of all the things I've done wrong at her house like bringing wrong types of desserts and wearing inappropriate clothes (um I wore a blouse and leather jacket) and not standing up when guests arrived. This year mother inlaw only sent an invitation to Ted to spend xmas with family. He told me his mom didn't invite me because of my last year's negative points and would rather have just him there this year. I was flabbergasted I asked if he was actually considering going after his mom excluded me and he shrugged and said yes because he never spent xmas away from family his entire life and isn't about to break the cycle now. He suggested I go out, invite Regina (my best friend) over or just plan my own celebration and said but nothing too crazy, capeesh?. I was upset but hey! if they don't want me then I shouldn't force it and tried to not feel hurt and offended. Yesterday Ted came home asking if his bags were ready since it was time to go. I said I don't know and he was stunned. he freaked out saying I knew he was going to travel to his hometown and I should've packed his bags like I always do. I admit that packing his bags is what I do but ONLY WHEN WE'RE TRAVELING TOGETHER and I figured since he was traveling on his own then he should pack them himself. He lost it saying I just caused him to be late and ruined all the (flight/hotel/other reservations) arrangements he had just because I was being bitter because I wasn't invited to xmas celebration with his family. We had a heated argument and he said Look, you're really overreacting right now because it's not like I'm going away on a vacation to another country to spend time with some strippers and whatnot though I'm pretty certain you wouldn't be as half pissed and agitated as you are now. I'm just going to spend time with my family and quite frankly, I don't know what it is with you anymore. Then proceeded to call me petty and say I got him in trouble and punished him by not packing his bags for him knowing he was going to travel. He packed his bags in a rush and ended up forgetting most of the gifts he got for his family. He's now not speaking to me. AITA? ETA: I found out that it's not just my mother inlaw but father inlaw and Ted's brothers figured it would be best that I don't attend their xmas and instead go to my own family claiming they were giving me the options to decide and also they claimed they don't want to force me to be with them since we have some tension between us. ETA2: Ted said this is all temprarily until his family and I get used to and adapt with each others.",

She is my only sister's only child. 2 years ago I married a very wealthy man (34M), and because of the pandemic, last Christmas was my first with my in-laws. My MIL gifted me a coat that is worth more than $20k (I saw her wearing it, asked her where she bought it, and she said that it will be my Christmas gift from her). I didn't know how much it was (I knew it was expensive, but I thought maybe $3k at most). I was visiting my sister last January when my niece saw it, she googled the brand and showed me how much it really was. I won't lie, I didn't wear it after that because I was afraid of ruining it. Last week, I wore it while visiting my sister. While I was putting it back on to leave, I felt something go *splat* on my back, then my niece started cackling and the smell of paint hit me. I was so pissed off while she was not apologitic at all. Her mom screamed at her and said she was grounded. Then she said she will pay for the dry cleaning. While I was in my car, still in shock BTW, I got an alert that my niece posted a reel, it was of her *doing a prank* on me, and she said I'm going to hit my aunt's $20k coat with a paint filled balloon to see how she reacts. I saved it on my phone, sent it to her mom and told her that a week's grounding is not enough. She did not reply, but I saw that my niece took it down (it got less than 5 views by then). The next day I found out my coat can not be saved, so I called my sister and told her that her daughter has to pay it back. Well, we got into an argument and she said that they will not be paying it, and if I wanted a new one, I should get my husband to buy it for me. I think that they should pay for it (they can afford to, IMO they should sell my niece's car and pay me back my money).  We did not reach an agreement, so I told her that I will be suing, and reminded her that I have video evidence that her daughter A) did it on purpose for online clout and B) knew exactly how expensive it was. People in my life are not objective at all, I have some calling me an AH, some saying they are the AHs for not buying me a new one, and some so obsessed with the price of the coat that they are calling me an AH for simply owning it and wanting a new one. So AITA? Edit: sorry for not making it clearer, but my coat was bought new, just identical to my MIL's.",

        "selftext": "I own a vape shop. We're a small business, only 12 employees.   One of my employees, Peggy, was supposed to open yesterday. Peggy has recently been promoted to Manager, after 2 solid years of good work as a cashier. I really thought she could handle the responsibility.   So, I wake up, 3 hours after the place should be open, and I have 22 notifications on the store Facebook page. Customers have been trying to come shop, but the store is closed. Employees are showing up to work, but they're locked out.    I call Peggy, and get no response. I text her, same thing. So I go in and open the store. An hour before her shift was supposed to be **over**, she calls me back.   I ask her if she's ok, and she says she needed to take a mental health day and do some self-care. I'm still pretty pissed at this point, but I'm trying to be understanding, as I know how important mental health can be. So I ask her why she didn't call me as soon as she knew she needed the day off. Her response: I didn't have enough spoons in my drawer for that..   Frankly, IDK what that means. But it seems to me like she's saying she cannot be trusted to handle the responsibility of opening the store in the AM.   So I told her that she had two choices:   1) Go back to her old position, with her old pay.   2) I fire her completely.   She's calling me all sorts of -ist now, and says I'm discriminating against her due to her poor mental health and her gender.  None of this would have been a problem if she simply took 2 minutes to call out. I would have got up and opened the store on time. But this no-call/no-show shit is not the way to run a successful business.  I think I might be the AH here, because I **am** taking away her promotion over something she really had no control over.   But at the same time, she really could have called me.   So, reddit, I leave it to you: Am I the asshole? EDIT: I came back from making a sandwich and had 41 messages.

One thing that was hammered into my head from a young age was to always, *always* bring a small gift when visiting anyone's house. It doesn't matter if it's family or friends or that one person you kind of know but don't really like, bringing something is a must. My bf (28m) and I have been dating for almost 4 years now and since we both work from home he suggested we make dinner with his parents a weekly thing since we haven't been able to see each other much for obvious reasons. I love his parents, so obviously I agreed! Every week I made sure to bring something small to show my appreciation for them cooking for us (always using my own money); a small bottle of wine, their favorite dessert, some flowers etc. and they always thanked me for it. This has been going on for a few months and absolutely didn't notice anything out of the ordinary until yesterday when my bf and I were preparing to head over. I'd gotten a cute vase of daffodils since luckily I'd found some in bloom and my bf's mom really loves them, but my bf suddenly got really mad and asked why I kept bringing stuff over every week like his parents were a charity case. Honestly I got super confused and asked him what the problem was and that I've always done this with everyone including his friends since we met. That it was a cultural thing but then he got even madder and told me to stop imposing my culture on everyone and it's weird since I'm white. At that point I didn't feel like going anywhere with him and just gave him the flowers and went for a walk while he drove over to dinner by himself. After he came home he still had the flowers which he gave to me and told me he was sorry but his parents really were super annoyed with me constantly bringing stuff over like they can't take care of themselves, and later on I got a text from his dad asking me to not come over for dinner anymore. Now my bf's giving me the cold shoulder unless I give his parents a huge apology, but I really, truly don't feel like I'm in the wrong for trying to be nice to them. AITA? quick edit: I didn't realize you could edit posts directly but I'm in a hurry to convince him to let me go over to his parent's house. I did post a brief update and faq in my most recent comment.",

        "selftext": "Edit 4: I now own a CPAP machine. This weekend, I (35m) took a sleep test for the first time in my life. My wife (36f), is a skeptic of American medicine and has been upset with how much I use my phone. So to start, we have an 18 month old baby that we take care of, but I wake up groggy and grumpy every day and have been for decades. So when I finally had the chance to take a sleep study, I jumped on it. Now, I got the results back 2 days ago, and it came back positive. Obstructive sleep apnea. I wasn't surprised. What did surprise me was the price of a machine, nearly $900. So I booked an appointment to get the machine. My wife was livid. She told me that it's too much to pay, that I have student loans to pay off, that she's been saving all this money just for me to waste on myself, when she hasn't gotten a good night's sleep in over a year and a half.  She says that since I sleep heavily, I might sleep better than she does. So last night, she was saying all I need to do is Don't be in your phone all the time and you'll sleep better. I was tired of her always thinking she's smarter than doctors so I abruptly said F*ck you. and stormed out of the room. Now it's today. I cancelled the appointment, I'm not expecting anything to get better, she is still not speaking to me, and I'm wondering if I'm wrong here. AITA? Edit 1: to clarify, we have more than a year's income in savings, so at this point we are hoarding money. Also, she told me it was just doctors trying to make money. Also, she told me to my face you wouldn't use it anyway. Lastly, I do use my phone at night, but only to combat existing insomnia. So if I get a good night's rest, I am less likely to overuse coffee to stay alert during the day, breaking the cycle of coffee -> bad night's sleep -> coffee. Edit 2: I'm only 130lbs, so it's clearly not a weight/diabetic issue. We have two beds, one in the master bedroom and one in the basement across the house, so it wouldn't be a noise issue to get one. And I understand I need to be nicer about this. It's not the first time I've sought medical help (she doesn't really believe in psychology or therapy) and she pushes back on every decision, so I admit I snapped and need to work on that. My results were 5.1 stoppages per hour on average, and lowest blood oxygen level was 89% average. Edit 3: I've gone ahead and ordered a machine.",

My husband had me got up although I wasn't finish with dinner but he said we should leave. In the car, he lost it on me asking what brain cell made me think it was a good idea to tell his mom that. I told him his mom kept pushing after I'd already given her an answer. still he said this was the most fucked up shit he heard me say. I replied that I was just frustrated and didn't mean to hurt her feelings and cause issues. he argued that if I don't want issues then I should stop making shit difficult and just say yes to his mom's request. he then ranted about how it's his son too and then said if his mom isn't allowed in there then he won't be there too. now I don't know if he really meant this or just said it in the hear of the moment but it had me fuming. He's been ignoring me when I try to talk to him and act like I'm not in the room. I think I might have gone too far and created tension by responding inappropriately. AITA? EDIT/ there has been some tension between me, my husband, and his family lately this probably blew up because of built up resentment",

        "selftext": "This happened a couple of days before Christmas.  My sister, her 3 kids (4,6,8), and I were all staying at my parents house for the holidays. I have a 1TB iPad Pro (the largest screen model) that I use for my job. I do digital commissions, design band posters, design flyers to make money on the side as I\u2019m in college. I saved up for a year to buy this iPad, it was an investment in my hobby.  I left the iPad plugged up in my fathers study where I was working on some projects the night before. I got up in the morning to find the thing *shattered* in the living room. My sister nonchalantly apologized and said \u201coh sorry the kids broke your screen. Dad says he has a new one he\u2019ll give you to replace it.\u201d  She didn\u2019t even bother to wake me up when she saw that they were broke it. I asked her why she wasn\u2019t watching her fucking kids, and how they got my iPad from my fathers study. She said that she *gave it to them* so they could watch YouTube. I obviously started yelling at her, and asked her how she could be to obtuse as to let her kids play with my stuff without asking. She called me selfish. \u201cThey\u2019re my niece and nephews and I should want to share with them.\u201d Wtf. My dad tried to give me a iPad Air, and tell me that it was the same thing. I told him it was unacceptable and I wanted my iPad replaced *immediately*. He said he didn\u2019t have the money, so I went to my sister and demanded the money. She tried to ask if she could make payments as the cost would wipe out her savings, and I said no way. I wanted the full cost of the iPad, the pencil , AND the $250 that I\u2019m going to miss out on because I couldn\u2019t finish the project I was working on It would be around $2200 dollars.  She tried to call me heartless, and told me to think of my niece and nephew. I told her to go fuck herself, if she was a better mother she\u2019d have more than 2k saved up when she has three kids. My parents think I\u2019m over reacting, but I don\u2019t. She is trying to avoid me and not speak to me, and I told her that I would be suing her then for the full cost of my iPad and lost wages.She\u2019s acting like a total bitch, and crying on social media about how her heartless brother is trying to sue her and break her and her children over an \u201chonest mistake\u201d. I\u2019ve gotten calls from several family members calling me a bad brother, and asking me to reconsider. I can\u2019t believe this is happening. WIBTA for suing my \u201cpoor broke sister\u201d because she can\u2019t watch her fucking kids? TLDR my sisters kids broke my expensive iPad and I\u2019m suing her, AITA?",

        "selftext": "I (19F) am a sophomore in college and have a friend, Tia (18F), who is in high school and applying for colleges and scholarships. I helped her throughout the college process and she ended up getting in early action to her top college, and she got a full scholarship. I was happy for her until recently.  I was talking to a mutual friend of ours and she started gushing about how Tia\u2019s essay was so heartfelt and beautiful. I asked to see it because I thought she had just forgotten to show me (she showed me many of her essay drafts). But as I was reading it, I was completely taken aback. The essay was one of MY college essay drafts which I\u2019d shown to Tia for reference on writing TECHNIQUES ONLY. I made this clear.  I was livid. The essay was really personal, and she barely even tweaked it up. It was almost entirely copied and pasted. I trusted her with it, and this is what she did.  In a fit of rage, I gathered all the evidence of me helping her with the college process, including evidence of me sending the specific essay to her, and I showed it to the school. She not only lost her scholarship, but she also lost her seat in the school.  Now, people are calling me dramatic and shaming me for robbing her of her education. She\u2019s the only person in her family to get into college and receive an academic and athletic scholarship, so everyone was rooting for her, including me at one time. And while I didn\u2019t expect the outcome to be so severe, it was.  Right now, I feel bad. I feel terrible. I feel like she took advantage of me, but I didn\u2019t want to be the cause of something so horrible. I did myself a justice, but at the cost of someone\u2019s dreams. Now I\u2019m wondering if what I did was justified or not.  AITA? ***EDIT*** First of all, thank you to everyone who offered kind words of reassurance and support. I obviously cannot reply to everyone, but I am going through all of these comments! You guys helped me realize that I wasn\u2019t in the wrong. \u2764\ufe0f All the nasty YTA comments, you guys also helped me realize I wasn\u2019t wrong\ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffc. Someone said that they hope all the Tia apologists are worked on my doctors who cheated throughout medical school and have their houses worked on by cheating electricians \ud83d\ude02.  Secondly, I didn\u2019t expect this post to blow up so much lol. I went to bed soon after posting it and thought that I\u2019d wake up to 50-60 replies at most. Somehow, I\u2019m on the front page too! Crazy stuff.",

Basically I grew up in a very repressive culture and family where premarital sex was big taboo especially for girls. It took me a long time to get over that. He knows all this. We were friends for 2 years and then dated for 6 months before we had sex and I told him about all my issues. He was the first guy I trusted enough to sleep with him.  We were using condoms and bc pills and I really don't know what happened. I already felt so guilty because I felt I must have screwed up somehow. We had already discussed previously how neither of us wanted kids right now. I went to talk to him before booking an abortion and the first thing he said was he wants a paternity test because 2 bc methods shouldn't have failed. I was so hurt that he could trust me so little after all the trust I put in him and that he thought I was the kind of person to cheat. Also I kind of started to believe what my mom always said that all guys think that girls who have premarital sex are just easy sluts.  So I told him since he didn't think it was his kid that meant his opinion on how to go forward was irrelevant. I broke up with him right then, even though he started saying that's not what he meant and he just wanted to be sure and then talk aboutwhat to do. I left, blocked him on all social media, got the abortion and never had any contact with him again. We have a lot of mutual friends and they have taken sides. Some think even if he did imply I cheated on him, since the baby was his, he should have had some say.",

Mom left cash on the table for me to pay. It was me, and two boys (7 and 10) large cheese pizza and breadsticks. I have always been under the impression that the babysitter is allowed to have a reasonable amount of dinner if they're expected to serve dinner. I've babysat a few times in the past and have never encountered this. When the parents came home to relieve me they asked how tonight went. I said fine, and said that the pizza place was really good as I had never ordered from there before. Mom looked at me puzzled, and asked why I ate the kids dinner. I said I just had two pieces of pizza and a breadstick. I feel as if this was not an inappropriate amount to eat. However, the parents disagreed. Dad said that they didn't expect to have to feed me dinner as well, and told me not to eat their family's food.  Overall, I am very uncomfortable and confused by this experience. Both boys were fed, and did not complain about being hungry for the rest of the night. I personally have always assumed, perhaps wrongly, that if I am expected to serve dinner as a sitter than I am welcome to have a serving. Is this something anyone else has experienced? AITA?",

        "selftext": "I (F-36) have a daughter (F-16) who loves baking, and she's incredibly good at it. It's her passion since she was 3 and I encourage her to follow it and discover more ways to become better at it. I even enrolled her in few classes in academy to learn more. I met my fiance (M-41) 2 and a half years ago. We're getting married soon. And for the wedding cake I had an idea which's to have my daughter bake the cake and decorate it for us. My daughter agreed and was so excited to do it. My fiance glanced at me when he heard about it then when we were alone he snapped and said I can't believe you're being serious about this I told him why not, it's not like we're having a huge formal wedding with many guests. Just a small party with our family and loved ones. He said this was a fucking joke and that he will not let a child bake our wedding cake while there are tons of professional bakers out there who can make a much more decent looking/tasting one. I said I didn't understand the problem because I thought he loved her baking. He responded I do love what she bakes but let's just stick to the muffins and brownies. I told him he was being unreasonable and that his words were hurtful to me and my daughter and her abilities. He told me to be more realistic and think about what the guests will say. again, I said all the guests are family and friends so I doubt they'd make any negative comments about the cake knowing my daughter made it. Matter of a fact, they might even think it's sweet. He got mad and said that there was nothing sweet about getting embarrassed on *his* wedding day. We argued for over 2 hours just going back and forth on the issue. Later, I got a call from his mother telling me that I should start being rational and look at things from her son's prespective. She suggested we get a professional cake for the wedding then have my daughter maybe bake some cupcakes for the buffett or something. But I wasn't convinced and felt like they're deciding my wedding's plans for me and forcing what they want on me. I don't care how the cake will look but it's the sentiment I care about.",

        "selftext": " My biological (12yo) daughter ~ Susan likes to collect and read old children's books. She's become incredible reader. She had problems with reading and learning before and we were advised to encourage her to read and eversince she started reading (which she does regularly) her skills improved. she also reads to her 2yo sister everynight. I have a (16yo), stepson ~ Levi who can be a hothead sometimes. We don't have a son~dad relationship but I respect him and he respects me though he can act quite mean and selfish towards me and his sisters. He'd throw away stuff that belongs to us over small arguments and teases Susan for spending a lot of time to read calling her grandma. My wife and I discussed his behavior and had conversations and agreed on punishments but Levi'd go to his dad's place whenever he causes troubles then have his dad yell at me for wanting to discuss a suitable punishment. Then Levi comes home days later expecting me to let go of what he did everytime, it's frustrating. I got a call at work from Susan saying Levi took her entire book collection and threw them in the pool after she refused to lend him and his friends her camera for his trip. My wife helped get them out but they were wet and some were torn. It was horrific because some of those books are hard to get and meant a lot to Susan as a part of her life.I was so mad at Levi I came home to have a conversation with my wife to decide on a punishment but he already packed a small bag and went to his dad's, I asked my wife how could she let him basically run after doing this and she said he called his dad and he came to pick him up after Susan said that I was coming home to deal with the problem. I went to his dad's house and he refused to let me see him. I told him how Levi was hiding from consequences and his dad tried to justify why Levi was acting out by blaming me for how me and Susan treat him. He even said he'd get CPS involved if I ever try to punish him because I'm not his dad, I have no right. Adding what Levi did was a reaction to my daughter being mean to him. He told me to leave because Levi won't come home til I promise not to do anything about what he did and put it in writing. I told him Levi should stay there with him then. He's not to come back til ~he~ get proper punishment.His dad argued it's his mom's house too and called my wife and she asked to let this go and we'll figure out some way to resolve it but I don't think it's fair for Susan to have her books ruined and Levi getting away with it. They're asking me to let it go but this will only encourage Levi to do worse if I don't deal with it now.It's been 2 weeks and my in-laws say I was out of line for banning Levi from coming home and are telling me to step back but I refused. EDIT ~ Levi's dad thinks that because I'm not his bio dad then I have no right to punish him for whatever he does in the house. In the past his dad caused issues when I used to take Levi's electronics (that his dad bought) as punishment. Then I got talked out of punishing him everytime he did something unacceptable wether to me or his sisters. I've arranged for family therapy but Levi's dad refused to let him go. EDIT ~ I'd like to mention that my inlaws said that Levi is willing to apologize to Susan and so this should be enough to get this over with but I kept saying no and for that I'm being considered at fault.",

        "selftext": "I'm just going to be direct and quick.  I (M35) have 2 sisters that I'm close with, I also have a niece (Leah), Leah's 16 and after my ex wife decided to split up and divorce due to inferitility problems that lasted for 5 years. I started a college fund for Leah to help her go to her chosen college. That was in 2019  Now I visit my mother's home (where my sister and Leah are living) every week to spend the weekend together.  This past weekend I was asleep upstairs while my mother, my sister and Leah were in the kitchen. I came downstairs to grab a glass of water and heard my sister talking about my ex wife expecting a baby with her new husband. This struck a nerve and I kind of froze from shock. I then heard Leah react to the news repeatedly saying I told you so I told you so then explained she's always thought that I was the one with a problem for not being able to have a baby with my ex, but that I was too afraid to admit due to fragile masculinity. I could not believe what she said but what made it worse is her following statement about how my ex was smart to get a divorce before it was too late. I went upstairs and into the room and shut the door and stayed there for hours.  Mom and sister saw me about to leave and insisted to know what the problem was. I didn't want to argue but I told them that I heard what Leah said about me. Leah stopped eating and got quiet. My sister tried to play dumb but I told her I heard their entire conversation about my ex wife and her pregnancy news. My sister tried to backpaddle saying Leah is just a kid who doesn't know much about this stuff and was just spouting nonesense. I told them I don't wanna talk about it and they refused to let me leave but I left eventually. I later sent my sister a text telling her about how hurt and devastated I was because of what Leah said, and told her I will no longer be responsible for funding her education. My sister kept trying to call then texted saying Leah didn't mean what she said and offered to make her apologize but I didn't feel comfortable being in the same room with someone who, blamed me for something that was out of my control and, something that literally turned my life upside down.  My mother tried to get me to come over so we could talk saying Leah doesn't deseve me turning my back on her like that. ETA So this went off unexpectedly, I read a lot of insightful comments but couldn't keep up (I'm sorry). I haven't seen my sister nor Leah after what happened. but they are still trying to contact me, which means there's still a room for a discussion and so I've decided to go see them tomorrow, sit down together and have a long conversation but this. Now I admit I'm not the type of person that feels comfortable talking about what's bothering me. especially when it comes to sensitive topics, but like some of you have said, this is my family, my niece and her future. I admit that I was mad when I told my sister about the college fund cancelation, I love Leah so much and see her as my own daughter. Unfortunately her dad, my BIL is deceased and so I understand losing a parent at a young age and relate to the kind of hurt she carries inside ( lost my father in an accident when I was 11) And I think that...sitting down and talking things out is the best option before I make any decision. Hopefully this will get resolved soon and I'm so sorry for the long ETA but I just wanted to let you guys know. I might update on what happens after we talk so we'll see how it goes. Thank you so much for bearing with me. Also, one more thing to clarify, both my ex wife and I were having these fertility issues, both sides but since my ex wife got pregnant soon after her new marriage then my family thought that I was the problem originally. It is what it is and I'm learning to not words get in my head so easily. I'm not mad at anyone, I'm just trying to move on with my life like anybody else.",

I also work a physically intense outdoor job so I come home really sweaty and exhausted from the heat. The apartment will stay cool enough for me to fall asleep but then later on I\u2019ll wake up in the middle of the night completely drenched in sweat. I\u2019ll then get up and find out that my roommate has been switching the ac off while I\u2019m sleeping. This really upsets me because it\u2019s been making me really dehydrated and tired to begin with from not sleeping well and it\u2019s been impacting my work. She\u2019s unemployed right now so I thought she might\u2019ve been hung up about the power bill. When I finally talked to her about it I explained that I\u2019m already very sensitive to heat to begin with and that because we\u2019re fortunate enough to have ac I want to enjoy it when I get home especially after a long day at work, and that the heat is causing problems for me. I even offered to foot some of her share of the power bill if she was really that concerned about it. But then she said that she turns it off because the apartment gets too cold (I should add that our AC is set at 70 and has never been moved lower than that).  I told her that she should just use some blankets or put a sweater on if it was really bothering her, because the heat is unbearable. She then countered by saying that because she\u2019s in recovery from anorexia she\u2019s really sensitive to cold and that I\u2019m not prioritizing her needs. I then responded by saying, \u201cI\u2019m sympathetic to your situation, but that is your problem and not mine, and it is starting to have a negative impact on me and we need to find some middle ground here, because I can\u2019t take off my skin when it gets too hot.\u201d She then got extremely upset and angry and told me that I was being ableist and insensitive. I\u2019m kind of bothered by this because I\u2019ve also had struggles with eating disorders in the past. So am I the asshole here? (Additional info from a comment I made so it doesn\u2019t get buried: I see a lot of people making the assumption that I\u2019m completely unwilling to compromise with her or that I\u2019m set on having it at 70. During our talk I offered to adjust the temperature but she wants it COMPLETELY off. Not adjusted. Off all the way. And that was what made me angry.)",

        "selftext": "So, I'm a 28 year old dude and have been living in my house for a few years now. One of the main reasons I chose this place was because my bedroom faced east, allowing me to wake up to the morning sunlight. Most mornings I wake up before my alarm goes off just because the sunlight coming through the window waking me up. There used to be a treeline that provided a natural barrier between my house and any potential neighbors, so I never saw the need for curtains or blinds along with they are expensive as hell for the nice ones. Recently my neighborhood expanded and most of the treeline my bedroom was facing was cut down to build new houses. So boom, then there's a house was built right across from mine, and their window has a clear view into my bedroom. I've always been comfortable sleeping nude, and it wasn't an issue when there were no neighbors around. But not long after the people moved in the father from the house came over to my house and pretty much told me to stop being nude in front of my windows since his family can see inside my bedroom. He wasn't nice about it. But, he wasn't mean either just matter of factly like he gave me an order a fully expected it to be done like I was his kid or his employee. I was somewhat surprised but understood his concern, so I made an effort to be more mindful of my nudity when in view of the window. I stopped cleaning and making my bed before getting dressed. I'd hop out of bed walk into my closet and at least put on shorts then go about my morning chores. That being said, I still sleep nude, and I occasionally end up being visible to the neighbors for a brief moment after waking up. The father came over again, leading to an argument between us. I told him I was trying my best to be considerate, but there's only so much I can do and that it's my house and I'm not changing my lifestyle because they moved in. He threatened to call the police and said I was being a menace to the neighborhood whatever the hell that means. So, am I the asshole for continuing to sleep nude even though my neighbors can see into my bedroom?",

        "selftext": "eta: Nate's family is also really conservative and he was brought up like that as well. Someone mentioned I should have added this in. Also, I'm from the US since a lot of people asked.. This is so so so embarrassing but I can't take it anymore. I have to know if i'm in the wrong here. I need to apologise if so... I (21F) was told by my bf, Nate (26M) that i'd get the house to myself for the weekend. He said he had to go visit his parents to take care of a property related issue. I was pretty excited to have the house to myself because I have been living with Nate since I was 19 and I missed living alone (though Nate is the loml and in no way a trouble to live with) I had this tradition of spending a lot of my weekends baking while in my lingerie (idk it makes me feel pretty. Yes ik it's stupid but it just makes me stupid happy) with music and dancing. Super embarrassing to admit but I also do silly things like pretending i'm a Victoria's model or a singer and I sing along, loudly. I mentioned this because this means the house is usually a mess. My dresses are all over and the music is super loud which is obviously not ok. I hadn't done that in a long time because Nate hates loud music and he's not a fan of my cupcakes. So i decided to do it this weekend. So it's Sunday and I put on 'what a feeling by One Direction' and it's super loud, i'm only wearing lingerie (the Victoria's kind so lacy af. which I regret sm looking back ugh). My bf used his key to open the door and I didn't hear him come in because like i said, it's loud in the house and i'm also in the kitchen/living room area. Apparently he wanted to surprise me... Nate brought his mom, dad, and his sister's two kids (only like 10M think). They come in and there I am, frozen in a dance pose like an idiot. I quickly ran to our room, yelling Sorry, wasn't expecting anyone! and was putting on clothes, when Nate come in. He was so angry. He said i was acting like a child and that I embarrassed him. His parents wanted Nate to drop them back asap, refusing to stay and his mom called me a lot of names and said the kids had seen 'everything' and that made me feel guilty af... Here's why I am losing sleep over this: On one hand, I didn't know they would come. I locked the door too so I feel like I didn't do anything wrong. I planned on cleaning up my mess before Nate came home too. Also, Nate and his mom insulted me a lot. But when you look at it from their perspective, I was behaving like an immature person. The house was a mess, I looked a mess, there were baking supplies scattered. Nate just wanted to surprise me and do something nice. Nate is still not completely talking to me, I don't know how to face his family, and I also know his sister told him to make me behave or smn... So I feel like I should apologise before things get worse but I can't decide for sure if i'm in the wrong here so I need your help. thank you for reading.",

        "selftext": "My daughters 14&16 are on the same dance team. Their team won a competition on Sunday, and we were all so excited and proud of them. After the competition, my dad suggested we go out to eat and said he would pay for wherever we wanted. Older daughter, who loves seafood, has been asking for years to go to a restaurant that has unlimited crab legs, but it's a very pricy restaurant, so we've never been able to. She immediately suggested this restaurant. My dad liked the suggestion. My younger daughter suggested we go to her favorite restaurant, a local Mexican restaurant, instead. We've been there many times, as it's much more affordable. Knowing this would be a wasted opportunity, I said older daughter's suggestion made more sense because it was somewhere we'd never been. Younger daughter complained she wouldn't like anything there, but I assured her the menu would have more than crab legs. We got there, and sure enough, there were many dishes that didn't have seafood, including steak, youngest's favorite. Even though there were dishes without seafood, youngest daughter said she wasn't hungry because the restaurant smelled weird. I ordered her steak anyway. Younger daughter pouted throughout the meal. She picked at her steak. Older daughter was very happy, and completely absorbed in the crab legs. My mom tried to talk to my younger daughter about the competition, but she wasn't responsive. At the end of the meal, we were all stuffed except for youngest. My dad told everyone to pick a dessert to go, except for youngest because she's clearly not hungry. I asked my dad to leave her alone, and he did, but she was already upset. When we got home, I tried to talk to her. I explained that this was a rare opportunity and sometimes we need to let someone else have something nice. I told her I could have taken us to the Mexican restaurant this weekend. She said it's not the same, because the restaurant we go to the night of the competition is special, and we went somewhere she didn't like. I pointed out that she didn't know she didn't like it because she didn't try it. She said I know she hates seafood and that the restaurant is known for its seafood, so of course she wouldn't want to go there after a special event. She was annoyed all Monday and Tuesday but started to mellow on Wednesday. This morning she asked if we are going to the Mexican restaurant tomorrow. I said not this week because of her behavior, but we'll see next week. She wasn't happy. Am I being too hard on her? I think she was very rude to her grandparents, but I know when you're a teenager everything feels like a bigger deal than it is. Should I have just let her behavior slide and taken her to the Mexican restaurant?",

        "selftext": "I 30m and my Husband 33m have a  11-year-old daughter who\u2019s been going through severe bullying at school.  It\u2019s just keep getting worse. It started of with just name calling but has gotten worse over the past few weeks. Context: She\u2019s adopted, which is something we\u2019ve always been open about and celebrated as part of her story. Recently, some kids found out about her adoption and started saying horrible things \u2013 telling her stuff like her birth mother didn\u2019t want her. They tell her that she\u2019s unwanted tell her she a reject. ( which is not the case her mother loved her very much to the point she literally gave her life so she could be here)  If this wasn't bad enough  A few days ago, she came home in tears with her hair butchered  they\u2019d cut off 2 inch of her ponytail well in class all while taunting her names and laughing at her reaction.  They will follow her through the halls to make fun of her on a regular basis now. Both my husband and I have been in touch with the school about the bullying more times than I can count. I emailed, called, even showed up in person to speak with teachers and the principal, but all I got were empty promises that they\u2019d \u201clook into it.\u201d Nothing changed, and my daughter\u2019s mental health has taken a hit  she\u2019s anxious, struggling to sleep, and now begs us not to send her to school. Finally, out of frustration and feeling like no one was taking this seriously, we reached out to a lawyer to explore legal action against both the school and the bully\u2019s family. Only when the school and her parents learned we were considering a legal action did they start to act. Suddenly, the school calls me to say they\u2019re moving the bully out of my daughter\u2019s class and claim they \u201chad a talk\u201d with her. The girl\u2019s parents reached out too, saying they\u2019d \u201ctalk to their daughter\u201d and promised it would stop. But honestly, I don\u2019t believe them. It feels like they're all saying this just to get me to back off and avoid the legal consequences. I worry that once the dust settles, things will go right back to how they were, and my daughter will still be dealing with this. My family thinks I should give the school and parents a chance now that they\u2019re finally taking action, but I feel like it\u2019s all for show. So, AITA for moving forward with legal action even though the school and the bully\u2019s parents now claim they\u2019re handling it? ",

        "selftext": " Tldr at bottom. So to give some context, I (f32) have been married to my husband (m39) for 4 years. I work a full time job while he does a 3 times a week night shift. We have a 2 year old and I'm 6 months pregnant. This whole drama started days ago. My husband has a large family. And on every Christmas they'd gather at his father's house. My father in law passed away a year ago and This year my husband decided as the man of the family to host Christmas at our house. Unbeknowest to me, he sent out invitations for a 5 day Christmas celebration to his entire family which are about 26 members in total.I found out about by accident and I was too shocked to react. I confronted him on it and he said I shouldn't be surprised and just get used to it because after his father's death he's now the family's head and all major family events will be held in our house and in his presence. I freaked out and said no this is wrong and he should've talked to me first before sending out any invitations to his family knowing I have other commitments like work and taking care of the house and our son. He said we'll manage if I took time off work but that means more workload later and it'd take away from my maternity leave. I demanded he cancel the invitations but he refused saying over my dead body then walked out. I ended up sending a mass text to everyone who recieved an invitation explaining that we will not be hosting Christmas this year. He found out and went off on me calling my behabior outragously appalling and said that I  broke his word to his family and made him look small and with no authority. I in a very strict tone replied that I didn't sign up to host a celebration and accomadate 26 people while pregnant, taking care of a toddler and working. And I don't care if he became the head of family after his father's death because it means nothing to me. He took offense to that and walked out almost crying. He later talked about how I disrespected his father and him with what I said and demanded a hand written apology for cancelling the event and for being insensitive towards him and underminning his authority infront of his family but I said no apology from me in any form and the issue is still up especially with my MIL giving me a stern talk about how out of line I was for disrespecting my husband's decisions regarding the holiday celebration with family. tldr: my husband invited his family without telling me so I cancelled and he wants a formal apology. ETA to put this out there he planned on sitting and telling stories of his dad while I handle everything and his family believe that as guests it's rude to ask them to help.",

        "selftext": "New to Reddit as I need opinions.  My fianc\u00e9 and I (both 30s) are getting married in a couple of months. We now need to finalise our menu choices for our guests. Now, we are vegetarian. In general, we are pretty relaxed vegetarians. If we go out, we totally don't mind if our friends/family choose meat or fish to eat, same if we visit family. As long as there is a veggie option, then great. Now back to the wedding. On looking at the choices, and given it's our day, we thought it would be nice to have a fully vegetarian menu. My (32F) parents are paying for the meal and have been absolutely stunned by this choice. They say it's disrepectful to people who aren't in the vegetarian culture, and also disrespectful to our own values in terms of ensuring our friends have a nice time. They say it's forcing our ethics on other people. My viewpoint is: it is one meal only, on our day, where I'm sure it will be delicious whatever they're served. None of our friends have ever complained when coming to our house for (vegetarian) food but my parents say it's different at a wedding because people expect luxury food, especially if they are travelling from abroad (many are) and apparently this needs to include meat. I am honestly Natalie Imbruglia-d (torn) on this. Personally I don't mind that much if our guests eat meat but it is inconsistent with our own life choices and it is our day, so that could make it feel inauthentic. And I think the whole focus on meat thing is quite generational (my parents are in their 60s). My fianc\u00e9 agrees with me but the issue is my parents are (very kindly) paying for the meal.

My mom (43f) came into my room the other day asking me if I want to go and stay somewhere on that Saturday night so she can have her man over to do the deed. I was obviously upset by this and told her I planned on coming home as I wanted to sleep in my own bed. She then persisted that I go and stay with a friend because she didn\u2019t want to have to go out to do whatever (my twin siblings would also be out the house they are 5 and staying with my grandparents). I said it is not my problem that she wants someone to stay over and I will be coming home to sleep. She then told me that she would be loud and make sure to wake me up to hear and made it clear she did not want me home. This could have been a joke but either way that is not normal to say that to your child right? For context I have been hearing my mom have sex with her boyfriends at the time since I was around 10 years old and I had complained multiple times at hearing this. I obviously don\u2019t want to come home and hear my mom having sex but I also want to sleep at home as it is my bed and I too live there. We\u2019ve been going back and forth on this and now I\u2019m going to stay somewhere else but I still feel like she is in the wrong for asking me to leave in the first place. Idk what to think I understand where she is coming from but still? Edit:I feel like I need to clear some things up. First of all no I do not pay rent because simply I cannot afford to. I live in the UK so there is no underage drinking. I cannot simply just move out that is easier said then done and when I got to uni next year I do plan on leaving and my mom also agrees that then will be the best time for me to move. I am still in full time education and have a part time job so let\u2019s not be so harsh on the fact that I still live with my mom. I understand the privilege of living at home rent free but it doesn\u2019t take away from the fact that my own mom wants to get me out the house so she can have sex with someone. Some of you asked about the boyfriend and yes he does have his own home it\u2019s just in another city and I\u2019ve personally never met him. ",

She made absolutely no effort to sound kind when she, in an extremely rude and annoyed tone, told me to stop packing my son such \u201cdisgusting and inappropriate\u201d lunches. I felt absolutely appalled when she said this, as me and the teacher have, up until now, always maintained a very friendly relationship. She added that the lunches I\u2019m packing my son are \u201cvery distracting for the other students and have an unpleasant odor.\u201d I told her that I understand her concerns, as the lunches I pack are definitely not the healthiest, but the lunches are according to my son\u2019s preferences.

It is very important to me what my son enjoys, and I want him to like my lunches.

        "selftext": "I'm (18m) graduating high school at the end of this month. My dad dropped the bomb on me two nights ago that his stepdaughter (14f) has an award ceremony for some competition she entered and won in another state on that same day and that she really wants him to be there. He told me he couldn't possibly make it to both and since his wife and their children together will be going, he needs to be there too. He told me he would make it up to me and we could celebrate another time. I still live with him (not for much longer). My mom died when I was 7 and my dad got married again when I was 11 or 12. It's been a few years anyway. His stepdaughter never knew her bio dad, so my dad has accepted her as his own. And he has prioritized her a lot in the last 5/6 years. It doesn't always show in the most obvious ways but it can be felt. Father/son time was put on an indefinite hiatus and instead dad told me we needed to include her in our time together but he also spent time with just her for father/daughter time. I brought it up to my dad and he told me I wasn't exactly making an effort to be closer to her so he wanted us all to bond and didn't want me to just focus on my relationship with him. He has attended her dance things instead of my basketball games if they're on at the same time. It doesn't matter if mine was known about first, he will still skip my stuff to go to hers. He will take us on family days and whenever he and his wife say kids can choose he picks her choices over mine. He claims it's because they will be the most fun for everyone but really, he even says it afterward, anything his little princess wants. Our refrigerator and our shower broke at the same time. His stepdaughter's birthday was coming up so he took money from my birthday fund to pay for that stuff and so his stepdaughter would definitely get what she wanted (this barbie house thing and a whole fashion set and they were I think dad said $250). He didn't get all the money back by the time my birthday came around so instead he bought me a $30 gift card for Steam when he had promised me a new monitor and keyboard for my computer (that was a gift from my grandparents). When my dad told me he wouldn't be at my graduation to go and support her, I told him there is no making up for that and he can forget about being included in my life going forward. He told me he would make it up to me and I told him I will always come second to his little princess and I'm not going to be okay with that. I told him he's discarded me for the last time. Dad begged me to be reasonable but I walked away. Then I invited both sets of grandparents who agreed to come. His wife told me I could have come with them and I don't need to attend the ceremony but could support my sister. I said her daughter's not my sister and I do not want to support their family anymore and I will be out of their hair soon. She called me selfish and told me I can't deny her daughter a dad.  AITA?",

We\u2019ve talked to her about it and asked her very politely to please be more mindful about it because it is disturbing the rest of us but it\u2019s in one ear and out the other. We tried being more forceful about it saying that if she continues to slam her door there will start to be consequences. Still nothing changes. It all came to a head the other night when she got up to use the bathroom and all 4 of us were woken up by the slamming. I have to be up at 5am for work and I\u2019ve had enough of the broken sleep and came downstairs and knocked on her door. She opened it and said *WHAT?!* with such attitude it took a lot of self control not to start yelling. I told her as calmly as I could that if she slammed that door one more time she was going to come home and find it gone. She proceeded to yell at me to leave her alone and then slammed it 5 times as hard as she could. Well the next day (Friday) she went to school and my husband and I both had the day off so we took the door off the frame and installed a curtain rod with a nice heavy curtain over the door instead. She came home and freaked the fuck out. She said we\u2019re being emotionally abusive and taking away her right to privacy. She sulked all weekend and won\u2019t talk to us now. My mother says I\u2019m the AH because I overreacted but she doesn\u2019t have to deal with the house shaking. I want to add that we completely respect each other\u2019s privacy in our house which is why we hung up a heavy curtain and made sure that we couldn\u2019t see through it or around it. We even put little Velcro pieces on the walls and curtain sides so it stays in place. She still has her physical privacy which she is absolutely entitled to, but can\u2019t slam a piece of fabric. We also have never and still don\u2019t just go into her room unannounced and still knock on the wall to ask permission to enter. We\u2019ve told her we\u2019ll happily put her door back on once she agrees to respect the no slamming rule.  So AITA? Edit to add: 1) The curtain is an industrial type that blocks sound and light 2) The curtain is only meant to be a temporary measure. As soon as she agrees to stop slamming and be respectful of the shared space we will put it right back on. 3) The door isn\u2019t broken or malfunctioning in any way and there is no draft causing it to swing shut.",

        "selftext": "I have been keeping bees as a hobby for six years now. I have 4 hives in my suburbian backyard along with a large garden. My hives are all properly registered and are legal to keep in my town as of right now.  The problem is that my new neighbors have asked me to get rid of my bees. They purchased the house and moved in over the winter and hadn't noticed my girls until this spring.  Apparently their son is highly allergic to bee stings. He has been hospitalized more than once and has to carry an epi pen.  They asked nicely but seemed a little upset when I said I don't think I could do that. They didn't push the issue with me further but I saw a rant on nextdoor that I am sure was written by them. Some time after that some of the bee hating nextdoor people when to our town board and tried to get bee keeping outlawed in our town. Luckily it didn't pass and they had mentioned in the minutes that current bee keepers would have to be grandfathered in if it did (Because of that I am even more wary of giving it up in case they do bring this legislation up again If I have active hives I can keep them) My neighbors and I aren't really on speaking terms now.  AITA For wanting to keep doing my hobby? EDIT: Thank you for your input everyone Since many have suggested this - I DO already have security cameras in place. All around my house and pointing directly at the hives. You cannot access the hives without spending significant amount of time on video. The hives are also behind locked fences.  I just purchased a sign to put on their* gate that says this area is under video surveillance and will be affixing that to their gate ASAP. *by their I mean the bee's gate! EDIT 2:  Sorry to see we couldn't play nice and this thread got locked. Also thanks for the death threats in my DMs LOL But it looks like the overall consensus is NTA. So thanks for helping to put my mind at rest about this. Well, After sleeping on it and spending the morning making a few legal calls... **THE BEES ARE STAYING.** I just can't take the financial blow on this one. I have spent thousands on my yard. It provides a nice side income and I just can't do it.  I have all my legal ducks in a row, with my set up, carrying the proper insurance, and following all the state and local laws. I shouldn't have much to worry about legal issues as long as I keep doing it the way I have been.  I will reach out to my neighbors with an olive branch and some suggestions to keep their kid safe.  Many people have asked how I would feel if something happened to the kid. And sure, I would feel bad about it. It would be tragic. Also me bees have *always* been legally permitted and registered.",

        "selftext": "I 45F, have two kids: 14M and 17F. My son has High Functioning ASD, and honestly most people cannot tell, but it comes out in certain aspects of his relationships such as thinking about others, compassion, etc. My son also eats a lot of food- way more than someone for his age. He is not overweight in any way so the doctors have not considered this a problem. Here comes the problem- for years when we have ordered food, he has neglected to realize that the food we order is for the whole family, not just him. My husband and I have both spoken to him about this multiple times and usually he just gives half-hearted apologies. We are working on this with his therapist, among other issues he has. On Friday, my daughter had work after school so she drove herself there while my son took the bus home. He said he was hungry so I ordered a pizza and told him to save some for his father and sister. I only took a slice. Usually my daughter does not eat much (1-2 slices) and same thing with my husband. That would've left him with 5 slices of a LARGE pizza. About 2 hours later, my daughter comes home and sees the pizza box empty and starts balling. She usually is not one to complain about food and will usually just make her own food but she did not have time to eat before work today and during lunch she was making up a test, so she did not eat since breakfast. I was furious at my son and deducted the money for a new pizza plus a generous tip to the delivery driver from my son's bank account. My son saw and now he is pissed. My daughter thought it was the right thing to do, especially when this is about the 3rd time it had happened to her. My son's reasoning is that he doesn't work so his only sources of income are for his birthday and Christmas, so my daughter should've paid since she has a job. My husband and I both are on board with what I did, but idk, is my son right? AITA?   ***UPDATE: For everyone saying we are underfeeding him, we have tons of food in the house. The fridge is stocked, we have snacks, ingredients etc. My son refuses to learn how to cook, even when we have offered him cooking classes. Even without learning to cook, we have boxed pasta, popcorn, bread, vegetables and fruits, rice etc. all of which require no cooking ability. He simply chose to eat the whole pizza.**",

        "selftext": "My (23F) wedding was back on Saturday December 31st and I'm still getting backlash from this, so I want to know if this was an AH move. In the country I live in it's currently winter, and we get a fair amount of snow so my wedding was a winter themed wedding. The color theme was forest green and gold. My dress was obviously white, and I chose the color of my bridesmaids dresses to be forest green as well. My MOHs dress was black, and everyone was to wear gold accessories.  I have this friend, we'll call her Kat, that I asked to be one of my bridesmaids. When we went dress shopping and I told them the color theme I was going for, Kat immediately expressed that she thought forest green was a bad choice. She said the thinks it's not a flattering color, and thought I should choose something different and more girly. I said no because my wedding was winter themed and I thought the color would go perfect with the theme. She suggested a pink, blue even a red. I said no, but thanks' for your opinion. She found out my MOHs dress was black and asked if she could wear black too? I said no, only my MOH is wearing black.  I paid for all the dresses.  Fast forward to wedding day, everyone's getting their hair and makeup done and Kat show's up 30 minutes late holding a bag that looked like it had a dress inside. I asked her what this was for? She told me it was for later on at the reception if she got uncomfortable and wanted to change after pictures. I was like ok cool. So fast forward we're all dressed and walking down the stairs because the ceremony is beginning in 30 mins and we were going to take some pictures before. Kat is the last person to come down and she's wearing a BLACK DRESS. At the time I was preoccupied taking pictures with my parents, but my MOH came over to me and made me aware of the situation.  I confronted Kat and asked her what was going on. She said she hates her bridesmaid dress, as the color is ugly and makes her look gross so she's wearing black. I told her please go back and change. She refused and started walking away from me. I said I'm going to ask her one more time, and if she doesn't oblige I'm calling security and kicking her out.  She began yelling at me to fuck off, so I called security and asked them to please escort her out. She started making a BIG scene yelling how I'm such a bitch, that I can't force her to wear anything and that I'm a horrible inconsiderate friend.  The wedding went on and it was truly amazing. Ever since the wedding Kat has been blowing up my phone with texts saying some really nasty thing's and asking for the money back she spent on the black dress, since it was a waste and she didn't get to wear it. I had to block her number. Some of my other bridesmaids have been giving me shit saying that it was a little harsh kicking her out and embarrassing her like that. And that maybe I should give her the money back. AITA for kicking her out?",

I'm on okay terms with them but since we've only been married for a short time and I don't see his family much, we still have that barrier that keeps is from being completely comfortable around each other.\rHis family arranged for the vacation last week. I out of curiosity asked if I could come. My husband felt hasitant but I told him it'd be a great opportunities to get to know his family better. He agreed to take me and his family were surprised to see me but still welcomed me.\rOn the 3rd day of the vacation. His dad, mom, brothers and spouses were all sitting at a table outside talking while I was preparing a fruit salad. As I was making my way back I overheard my MIL say ...did she really had nowhere else to spend the weekend?. At first I had no idea who she was talking about so I kept on walking, but stopped once I overheard my husband say l KNOW!!!! And I didn't want to bring her with me but what was I supposed to do?!!! You know how pushy she can get. I instantly figured it was about me. I felt so shaken up to the point where I almost dropped the salad. This whole time I was there I cleaned, cooked, looked after the kids and this is how they think of me? An inconvenience to them?.\rI quietly booked a ticket and went home on the first plane. He called and texted but I didn't respond anything other than let him know I was home. He got back and went off on me saying what I did was disrespectful and juvenile. I told him I overheard the conversation he had with his mom but he said that I was wrong for eavesdropping and that his family will warm up to me on their terms so I should stop pushing to be around that when they don't feel comfortable with it. Basically saying it was my fault for coming along in the first place. He said that going home like made him and his family disappointed and gave them a really bad impression about me. I think that I might have messed this up and someehat ruined it for them as well.",

Fun fact: he drives 2 cars that he adjusted/fixed on his own. We don't live together but we do meet at my place every weekend. He called and asked what we will be doing on friday and I said I wanted to host a GNI since it was my turn. He asked what the heck was a GNI I said a girls night in and he got quiet then asked if I was being series. I was confused as he started talking about how outdated and sooo 1950s those events are and said that I should stop promoting and advocating for those events as they are sooo toxic and flatout reek of misogyny. I was shocked by his long rant but he said that was his honest opinion. I told him regardless I still plan to host the event after he tried talking me out of it and suggested we go out together. He threw a fit after he suggested bringing his guy friends to join us and I refused since this is not how GNIs work!. He called me a sexist and misogynistic for having a girls night in and making it so obvious instead of being ashamed of myself. He said that my mentality will cause me issues in the future especially if I behave like that in a professional work setting. Let me tell you I was BLOWN AWAY by how he got so worked up like that over me just missing my girls and wanting to spend time with them. We argued some more and he hung up on me after I said I will not stop hosting or being part of GNIs nomatter what he says about it. I tried to call and apologize for lashing out later but he sent a text saying he was hurt by how I handled our small disagreement and needs time to process what he just found out about my personality. This hurt me but my friendship and the bond I share with my girlfriends is huge and I don'the want to risk years of friendships by no longer being part of our bonding activities. Aita?

        "selftext": "I moved from Georgia to the Pacific Northwest last year for a dream job after I graduated college. It was a little bit of a culture shock, because I went from being one of many black people around at any given time to often being the only non-white person in a room, let alone black person. There hasn't been a lot of overt racism, but there's been a lot of strange borderline situations that are amusing and race-related but not necessarily racist. For example, every white woman I meet mentions Beyonce to me within the first five minutes. When I was sitting for my driver's license photo the woman taking my picture opened with, 'So... Beyonce.' So the problem in the post title is that I am the only black woman at my office, and I am constantly, constantly being called the wrong name at work, and I'm coming up on my one-year anniversary. My name is Tina, short for Christina. Pronounced just like it looks, very easy name. For some reason, a handful of people at work call me Tiana, Tiara, or Tia, I think assuming that my name has to be more 'black sounding' than it is. I am most often called Tiana, especially by one of the guys on our development team and by the 'big boss' for another team, which I think then confuses their team members back into calling me the wrong name again. The other thing is that apparently another black woman (elderly, not in the same position I'm in) used to work there and I get called her name (Mary) sometimes too. Sometimes people will look at my name plate and ask me, How do you pronounce that? It's Tina! I have tried politely correcting this and I correct it immediately every time. From polite, Just for the record, my name is Tina! to lighthearted, Tina, like Tina Belcher! In e-mails from me that say Tina in a million places, including my e-mail address, I still get, Thanks Tiana! Sooo... I'm considering doing the Twitter approach, where I just respond to coworkers who call me the wrong name with the wrong name. Like: Chuck: Thanks, Tiana Tina: No problem, Chad! Jessica: Hi Tiara! Tina: Good morning, Jennifer! Would I be the asshole if I did this? I know it's passive aggressive, but every form of polite correction hasn't worked, and I feel really disrespected by this, so I may as well have some fun with it. EDIT: I am pretty overwhelmed by the responses so I just want to add a couple of things: A lot of people have suggested that I gently and firmly remind people of my name. That's what I've been doing, and was my first line of defense! A lot of people have suggested I go to HR. This is the kind of nebulous thing HR doesn't really help with, and it isn't as serious as it could be. A lot of people who identify themselves as white have informed me that this isn't race-related. It is. I have been black for 25 years, and I have a lot of firsthand experience with racism, and I can identify it in my own life. It isn't overt racism, like a slur or an assault, but it is still race-related. I feel like a few people are ALMOST getting it. A lot of people are referencing that Key and Peele sketch with the substitute teacher, which is literally a joke about how white people do this to black people, turned on its head! And finally, a few people have asked why I don't use Tina Turner as an example, since she's also a black Tina. First, I thought young-ish white people would be more familiar with Tina Belcher, but I used 'Tina Turner' as an example for our Dean and he then 'affectionately' nicknamed me Tina Turner, which took deprogramming from his EA to get over. EDIT #2: No, I don't have a southern accent. I'm from Atlanta, and black people from Atlanta don't really have an indecipherable country twang. Plus, my 'working in an office' voice is pretty practiced/neutral. More to the point, no accent makes the name 'Tina' sound like 'Tiana' or Tiara No, the people I work with aren't just 'idiots.' As annoying as this is, they are not stupid people. No, I can't wear a 'Hi, my name is' sticker or a nametag. We have a business professional dress code! Yes, I correct them every time. No, it's not because I'm not 'memorable' or a bad employee! Responding to this post saying, 'Okay Shaniqua' or some other racist caricature of a name truly misses the point, as this is already what my coworkers are doing ('Tiana' being the 'Shaniqua' in this instance). Several people have alarmingly said, 'Okay, Trayvon' and invoking the name of a dead black child at the idea of me calling a white guy 'Chad' is VERY WEIRD!",

We had a great time, service was great, and the experience was very enjoyable. It was time for us to pay our bills. All of us paid separate checks.  When we were all getting our credit cards out to pay, I said out loud to everybody just simply as a conversation Make sure to tip our waitress! She was amazing! Don't be that type of person who doesn't tip. Come on, guys! Not going to lie, I gave my boyfriend a blank stare when I said that.  My boyfriend never tips. He is one of those people where he only wants to pay what is on the bill. No more. No less. I have had conversations in the past with him explaining to him on the etiquette of tipping your waitress since they only make $1.37 an hour where we live and they literally rely on tips, but he does not care.  Anyways, back to the restaurant. None of our friends caught I was looking at my boyfriend because they were all focused on grabbing their credit cards and they simply did not know that he is not a tipper. As usual, my boyfriend did not tip the waitress, but myself and everybody else did.  We said good-bye to our friends and went home. My boyfriend and I took the same car home. He brought up the situation to me in the car. He said I knew you were singling me out at the restaurant when you brought up the tipping topic. I saw that look you gave me. I apologized immediately since he did not sound very thrilled based off the tone of his voice.  I expressed my concern, once again, on how I felt about him never tipping. As usual, he tells me how he literally does not care about tipping and never will anytime soon. The topic changed from there.  I've been thinking about this situation all week.

That image, those details are forever engraved on my mind and I'll never forget how I felt that day. This was truly a turning point in my life. My family have always been there for me so I kept close to them. My younger sister is currently engaged and her wedding will be in few months. She's struggling with money so I decided to help her and her fiance and pay the wedding dress. This allowed her to be able to buy her dream wedding gown that costs 7,000 ($). It's a lot for a dress but she literally cried because she wanted it. (This happened few days before we agreed to go buy the dress). We were eating dinner at my parents home and my cousin and aunt were there.  My aunt was asking my sister about the wedding and my sister said that everything was going according to plan and then casually laughed and said let's just hope he won't ran away with a pregnant mistress or something in our wedding day... I was blown away completely. She laughed and aunt laughed too as if this was a joke. She was basically mocking what happened with me in my wedding. It happened so fast I got up and started screaming at her calling her an idiot but my parents asked me to take it easy and she said it was a joke and she didn't think I'd react so intensely. My aunt remained seated and my cousin asked me to calm down and drink some water but I grabbed my stuff and as I was getting ready, I told my sister she was getting 0 dollars for her dream wedding dress then I walked out. I heard louder commotion as I walked and my dad and cousin followed me outside trying to talk but I asked to be left alone. My and dad spoke to saying I was too harsh on my sister over a joke and said that I know this is how she is with her dark sense of humor. They said she's been crying after I decided to back out of helping her and said this'd ruin her wedding. They want me to reconsider my decision since it might damage my relationship with my sister but I refused. Did I overreact? Info: it's my aunt that would usually bring up what happened from time to time and say stuff like if what happened didn't happen you would've had at least 2 kids now or do you know what day it is? your wedding anniversary ! It's harsh but she stopped doing it anymore. Maybe my sister is being influenced by her but still. It hurt the same, and more coming from my own sister.",

I\u2019ve never been good around children and due to my autism looking after myself has been hassle enough so I know that I\u2019d make an awful parent / guardian, especially when it comes to the emotional side of things. Ever since the accident I have been looking after my nephew and without exaggeration it has been absolutely draining on me. My entire life and my routine has been derailed because of this, which I know isn\u2019t my nephews fault, but it\u2019s been putting under an amount of stress that I can\u2019t handle. The problem is that aside from myself there is no one in our family who is able to take care of him. My parents are elderly and in their late 70s so they can\u2019t look after him. Custody hasn\u2019t been fully sorted out yet and if I was to decline my nephew would be placed into the foster system. I know it isn\u2019t great or the best outcome for him but I\u2019m dedicating to giving him over to them. They\u2019ll be able to find people who can better care for him and who want to care for him (as bad as that sounds). I haven\u2019t told him my decision yet but I have made my parents and friends aware and, well, their reaction has been worse than I expected. Obviously I didn\u2019t think they they would be okay with it but my parents are threatening to end communication with me and a lot of my friends are telling me that if I go through with this that they\u2019ll distance themselves from me. Obviously I\u2019m aware that my nephew wants to stay with family and that he could suffer from going into the foster system - but I can\u2019t take care of him in the way he needs. I can\u2019t afford to take on the cost of getting a bigger apartment with a room for him, let alone bring him up or take care of him. I think it\u2019s best that others do it, they\u2019ll do a better job than I can. But, still, people are calling me heartless and are making out that I\u2019m some monster for this. So am I the asshole? Update: Hello everyone. It\u2019s big a pretty stressful day and I haven\u2019t been able to read through the mountain of comments people have left but I am trying.  After reading what people have said about foster care I am looking into other options. I still don\u2019t think that I\u2019m good enough to be responsible for him but if worst comes to worst I\u2019ll have to do that. I\u2019d much rather take on the stress than hand him over to a system that is likely to take advantage of him and abuse him. That said I have spoken to his best friends parents today about the possibility of taking him in and they did seem to be willing to do it as far as I could tell, we\u2019re just going to talk about more of the particulars about it before deciding on anything. I want to thank everyone who have left productive comments that have given advice for me as well as those kind enough to offer themselves as potential carers for him. Given what everyone has said about this I have changed my mind about foster care but I still do think that I won\u2019t be able to care for him in the way he deserves but I am willing to do it if no other option presents itself.",

        "selftext": "I (23F) was raised by my older half sister (32F). I never met my dad and our mom OD'd when I was 10 and my sister was 19. My sister's dad was still in her life and was willing to support her, but not me. My sister chose to be my guardian and her father's family went low-contact with her as a result. In order to raise me she gave up a lot; her relationship with her father, college, her 20s, and so much more. A few months ago I got engaged and I told my sister that in addition to being my maid of honor, I also wanted her to be the one to walk me down the aisle. All my life she's had to fulfill so many roles for me -- big sister, mother, father, friend -- that it only felt right that those multiple roles be honored on one of the biggest days of my life. My sister was ecstatic and so was I, but when I brought it up with my fiance he objected. My future in-laws are very traditional and my fiance had always expected that his wedding would be a very traditional white wedding. He said that it was great that my sister was my MOH, but that her having two roles wasn't and that it wasn't appropriate for her to walk me down the aisle since that's usually done by a man. Apparently, his family had assumed that my future father-in-law would be the one to give me away since I don't have any male relatives. I told him that I appreciate his father being willing to fill that role, but that the one who make me the person I am is my sister and so it's right that she be the one to give me away. It turned into an argument that's spread to my in-laws. My MIL called me a few days ago to say that although she understand how important my sister is to me, that it's also my fiance's wedding and I shouldn't be putting my sister before him on his day. I definately heard her on that, but this is still important to me. At this point, my sister has even said that she doesn't mind just being the MOH and that she doesn't want to turn my happy day into something stressful. So now it's just me holding out and being stubborn, but I really don't want to concede on this point. Am I being the AH? **EDIT**    I did not expect this to blow up like this and haven't been able to read through all of your verdicts and comments yet, but I wanted to clarify on some of the inquiries which I've seen repeated so far.  **Are the in-laws contributing to the wedding?**  Yes. In fact, they're paying for about 75% of it since I'm in still in school and don't have the money to put towards a wedding the scale that fiance wanted.  **Does your fiance have sisters?**  No; he has two younger brothers. **Did he ask your sister for your hand?**  He did, actually. She also helped him custom design the engagement ring. She showed me their group text and at one point they spent three weeks trying to decide between five different diamonds. Maybe I should just propose with an infinity gauntlet.  It was very sweet and cute.  **What about when you have children/Have you talked about children?**  Because of a medical condition, I am infertile, though neither of us feel a particular strong urge to be parents anyway. But we also know we're still young and that may change, but even if it does it would be very far in the future. I know all to well that things happen, people leave or fall down or die and so even if we got to the point of wanting to adopt it would have to be when I'm financial stable enough that even alone I'd be able to support and care for a child without it being major blow to my or the child's quality of life.  **Could you walk down the aisle by yourself?**  That was my sister's suggestions when she said she was fine just being the MOH, but I rejected it. Because of her, I never walked alone on the worst days of my life so I'm definately not going to walk alone on the happiest.  **Your sister is amazing!**  She is, as far as I'm concerned, the definition of strength and love and I am collecting all of the kind kind things you all have said to show her because she doesn't realize how amazing she is and it's a gd crime.  **Please update us**  I absolutely will. You've all given me a lot to think about, including underlying motivations and larger implications. I'm going to be taking a few days to sit with that and with myself and my feelings, but I promise to make an update about how I've decided to move forward. ",

It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family.  My ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf.  She was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board.  Long story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?",

That\u2019s fine with me. His mother is a woman who I make the effort to be civil with but don\u2019t like. I am much younger than she and my husband are, and come from a more privileged background; she had a lot of things to say about that. She called me her ex\u2019s cash cow and that\u2019s one of the better things she said about me. We are not friends and I won\u2019t even describe her as nice to me. When my husband told her that we will buy my stepson a car for his birthday, she said she wants to chip in 5% of the cost and then we could tell my stepson that the gift is from all of his parents and step parents.  I don\u2019t want to do that. I don\u2019t need her 5% and my stepson knows that his mom and step dad are not in a position to equally share the cost of buying the car. I don\u2019t want recognition for paying 70% of his gift\u2019s cost but I don\u2019t want to share my and my husband\u2019s gift to my stepson with a woman who has always been antagonistic to me. I don\u2019t know why she wants us to gift the car jointly now because we\u2019ve never given my stepson a gift jointly before. And I don\u2019t understand what\u2019s so bad about getting separate gifts from me and his dad, and his mom and his stepdad. I know that many people will say that it\u2019s better for my stepson to see that all his parents and step parents are getting along. I\u2019m civil to his mom and I never talk negatively about her to him. Is that not enough? Am I incapable of being a good step mother to him if I\u2019m not best friends with his mom?

        "selftext": "My F,33 sister F,36 passed away a month ago because of cancer. It's devastating and words can't express how we feel. Her husband struggled to pay off debts and has asked me and my husband to take him and my nieces age, 13 & 16 in for some time. I have to say that I'm not on good terms with him. We've had more than our fair share of disagreements in the past. He tried to sue me and my husband for my own mother's house which I'm living in with my husband and daughter. but he claimed he needed money to pay for my sister's treatment and, this was the only way to get it after we (my brother and I) refused yo help. It's a long story but we're not on good terms. I agreed to only take my nieces in but not him. He tried to negotiate this saying his daughters are grieving and need him, their remaining parent to be around. I said he could see them during visits and that was it. My husband agreed with me at first. my brother inlaw showed up with my nieces days ago and I only let the girls in but turned him away after he tried to talk me into letting him stay. We had a huge argument and the girls went inside crying after their dad left repeatedly saying the want him. My husband is backing out of this saying we might be making a mistake seperating the girls from their dad when they're grieving. My aunt berated me saying I messed up entirely here. I argued that it's my home and I fon't feel comfortable with him staying after what he's done. She called me selfish and bitter and said I'm making it more difficult for the girls who just lost their mom. Now the girls are quiet but my 16yo niece keeps arguing about wanting her dad with them. My husband still thinks we're making a mistake and getting the girls to resent me to what I did to their dad who's grieving.",

        "selftext": "**EDIT** PLEASE STOP SENDING ME CHAT MESSAGES I cannot keep up with ALL of the stuff I'm seeing. **YES EVEN IF YOU'RE ABOUT TO SAY I KNOW YOU SAID DON'T MESSAGE ME BUT...** Years ago I got really into houseplants and started to collect them. Over the years Ive had up to 70, but whittled my collection down to about 35, just the ones I really love. My niece Jenny (14F) has developed an interest in plants and will come over and we will talk about them and she helps with propagation and repotting.  I had to go out of town for two weeks to take care of some work stuff so I asked SIL and Jenny if they could plant sit for me. I told Jenny I would pay but also give her a few cuttings as a trade off. They agreed and when they came over I gave a tour and explained the care needed, and also showed off a few prized plants. SIL asked how much a few of them ran me and I did share. This didn't seem weird bc the family knows and Ive gotten some plants as gifts. Well I returned from my trip and was horrified. They watered and gave the right amount of light, but they also decided to give a lot of my plants haircuts. Big ones. My prized cebu blue pothos mother plant was destroyed. The climbing one too. My manjula pothos had been done the same. My golden that I trained up my stairwell. My string of pearls, hearts, and ruby necklace all destroyed. My silver stripe philodendron. The worst was that my pink princess philo had been reduced to two leaves. And my albo monstera is down to three. I don't even think they got nodes necessarily. These plants are expensive and prized.  I basically broke down and when they came to meet me to give back my key I screamed and screamed at them. Jenny started crying saying I said I would give her cuttings so she thought it was okay. I screamed at her to go home and get what she stole from me and bring it back NOW because SHE KNEW I DIDN'T MEAN SHE COULD DESTROY MY FUCKING PLANTS SIL got between us and said what's done is done **im sorry i don't know why my one edit is gone!! AHHH and half the original post. please read my comments!!** I said no way, you're returning EVERYTHINGJenny said Mom already sold most of them on marketplaceI lost it and just screamed and screamed at them until Jenny was crying and her mom got in my face and told me I was having a tantrum over plants. I told her to get the fuck out of my house and don't EVER come anywhere near me or my home again. I called my brother (SIL husband) and he was shocked and said they told him I said it was all okay.He brought me the stuff she hadn't sold yet and apologized. I told him I never ever want either of them in the same room as me again, they're horrible, AWFUL, irredeemable people and that I hope they both burn in hell where they belong. He told me he gets that I'm upset but that I'm taking it too far and that family means not holding grudges.I told him to leave, and I cried for the rest of the day. I am posting because I need to know if my edict is over the top and if I'm overreacting.So AITA for telling them that they are NO LONGER WELCOME in my home and not even wanting them in the SAME ROOM?",

        "selftext": "I (25F) am getting married. My fianc\u00e9(25 M) and I decided on a dry wedding since we do not drink and see no point in spending money for alcohol. We were debating about getting a cash bar but then decided to no alcohol at all. (There will be a wide range of other drinks, not just juice and soda, provided).  We informed our guests via invitations with something along the lines of \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be worried about choosing a driver or paying a taxi, since everybody will be able to drive\u201d So a friend (26M) called me and asked if I was joking about the dry wedding. I denied it. He asked two times more and I still denied joking. Then he asked what was wrong with me and how is supposed to have fun without alcohol and how he should function that night. And that it was not alright to chose a dry wedding.  This is where I might have been the AH:  I told him that I was not obligated to provide alcohol to him just because he is not able to have fun without it. And that, if he needs alcohol so badly and cannot function without it for even one night with people he knew, that he might be having an alcohol problem and should consider a therapy to treat it.  He flipped out on me and I took his invitation back until he apologises because he used many slurs on me.  Our friends are divided about me being the asshole. Some say I was right, other says I was not right. So Reddit: AITA Someone said to edit this in, so I do: 1. Cash bar - we debated about but decided against it, since we would have to pay a fee for them to open a cash bar and we don\u2019t want to pay for alcohol.  2. Events other then the wedding: we host dinners/party\u2019s/events regularly for our friends and never provided alcohol. So to all people that know us, it is known that we were never ones to provide alcohol. The ones who wanted would bring a beer or two for themselves to a garden party but most of them just drank what we had available. Edit 2: I am seriously shocked about the \u201eI hate weddings so I drink at them\u201c comments. If you despise weddings why come to hammer yourself instead of staying away? No one forced you to come If you hate weddings so much. Edit 3: 1. I am still amazed how many people need alcohol for social gatherings and say \u201cthey need it to function and have fun because it\u2019s boring without\u201d - I still firmly believe that this is not healthy. 2. thank you for the info that less people will come to the wedding, but don\u2019t be afraid: 71 of 75 people are coming. A couple declined because their grandma has her 100 birthday that day. (Happy birthday in advance)3. I see that Reddit is also decided if I am an AH or not, so I take that but thank you for most respectful conversations and discussions :)",

He's a good heart and is normally rational but his one issue is that he expects to accompany me in every ocassion nomatter how big or small. He even went with me to my ex boyfriend's funeral after days of begging.  Now my best friend got married few days ago, it was very small and only close family and friends were invited, My boyfriend couldn't come because of the + one rule. He pitched a hissy fit saying my best friend has no respect for my relationship and was shocked when he learned that I was still going to attend, He told me that if he can't go then I'm expected to not go as well but that is my best friend and I had to respect her rules. He gave me an altimatum either we go together or I stay home with him. I ended up going cause again I respected my friend's rules. He was angry with me and kept calling the entire 2hr drive then stopped. Later I got a text from his friend telling me he (my boyfriend) got into an accident and was taken to the hospital. I freaked out he gave me the address and I had to leave the wedding and told my friends why.  I was a crying the entire drive home and kept calling his friend but got no response. I arrived to the hospital and asked about my boyfriend and they checked and told me he wasn't there, My anxiety reached 160% as I kept calling his friends one by one. I just went home and there he was...along with his friend. He saw me and said that he was sorry but this was the only he can get me home after I left him alone. After the initial shock I just blew up yelling at him about lying and making me leave my friend's wedding and having me literally go to the hospital and freaking out cause of him. I kicked his friend out and we got into an argument. He kept talking about how much I love him thus I left which is my own doing not his and he was just trying to see if I really chose my friend's wedding over him. He then argued that my friend caused this and I shouldn't agree with her to exclude him, I said what he did was horrible and called him horrible and then went to my room. It was awful cause my friends kept calling to check in on him cause they thought he was really at the hospital. He said I overreacted and that I yelled at the wrong person. AITA? Did I go too far? *Info based on request from a user:_ He has a history of mental health issues but got better the past few months. He also had a recent death in his family which really affected his health generally*",

I have never had feelings for Tom nor has he ever had feelings for me. Since college, Tom has been a huge watch fanatic. Two months ago, he was showing me this stunning vintage watch and made an off-handed comment about how he would die of joy if he somehow got his hands on one. Very coincidentally, I was in NYC a few weeks ago and stumbled upon this watch store that just so happened to have the exact one Tom wanted. It was expensive, I wont lie, at about $2,500, but I decided to get it for his 25th birthday (to me, it was basically fate lol). My boyfriend and I do very well financially so this was something that I could personally afford and wanted to buy for Tom, especially knowing how happy it'd make him. Tom has a tradition of hosting a dinner party at his place for his birthday and then following that up with cake and gift opening. I told him before the dinner that my gift was a huge surprise and asked if he could save it for last and he agreed. His girlfriend ends up going first and she gets him this gorgeous sweater that she crocheted for him and a book that he's been wanting, which I thought was super thoughtful and lovely. Last, it was my gift. When he opened it and saw what it was he literally screamed, hopped over a bunch of people, and squeezed me in this huge bear hug. I was SO happy to see him happy, it genuinely filled me with so much joy. He even got emotional and I saw him swipe a few tears. He also said that it was the best gift he'd ever received. The whole time, his girlfriend was only slightly smiling and stayed quiet. The next morning, I get a text from his girlfriend that essentially said that although she appreciated my thoughtful gift, she thought that it was a bit out of touch and lacking awareness. She admitted that Tom had also told her about the watch and she wanted to get it for him, but it was way out of her budget. She accused me of knowing this (I had NO idea) and still getting it to rub it in her face and to outshine her. She finished by saying how she felt like I had overstepped a boundary by getting the gift and would appreciate me not doing anything similar to it again in the future. I responded and told her that while I could see her POV, I was just trying to do a nice thing for a close friend of mine. I asked her, wouldn't you rather he gotten the gift and seen the happiness that it brought him than him not getting it at all? She responded that that happiness was only shared between [me] and Tom and no one else and that she felt hurt by my actions. Only my boyfriend knows about this and he's on my side. But thinking through it all again, I do see how I could've overstepped, but my boyfriend says that it's not my job to apologize for her insecurities. So AITA here?",

        "selftext": "As my title suggests, my mom is a huge Harry Potter nut. She and my dad actually met in a harry potter \u201cIRC\u201d (like Disord but for old people) in the early 00s got married had kids and from day one decided to embarrass us for life by naming us after some Harry Potter and Star Wars characters. It\u2019s honestly been hell. I have a stupid name and since we were little my parents have forced stuff like Harry Potter, Star Wars, marvel movies, etc etc down our throats. Everything is about dragons and magic and blah blah blah. I\u2019m so sick of it. Every birthday every holiday everything is just organized around \u201cfandom.\u201d So just like every Christmas the days leading up to Christmas we have to sit down every night and watch Harry Potter movies. It\u2019s. So. Fucking. BORING!!!! I can usually get away with knitting or drawing on my Ipad during this but this year my mom was like \u201clet\u2019s just have a technology and distraction free night every night\u201d I arranged to go over to my friend Missy\u2019s house instead for like two nights. Missy\u2019s family is NORMAL and likes things a NORMAL amount. My mom got really mad and started talking about how it\u2019s a family tradition and how I\u2019m basically rejecting her and went on her whole thing about how \u201cyou wouldn\u2019t exist if it wasn\u2019t for harry potter.\u201d I finally had it and just yelled \u201cNOBODY CARES THAT YOU WERE A BIG NAME IN THE HARRY POTTER FAN CLUB!!! I don\u2019t like Harry Potter! I don\u2019t like Star Wars! I HATE MARVEL MOVIES THEY\u2019RE ALL SO BORING PLEASE JUST LET ME HAVE MY OWN INTERESTS!\u201d I couldn\u2019t help it I started crying because I was just so frustrated because everything always has to be about harry potter this star wars that and now that we\u2019re all older they started doing game of thrones. EVERYTHING is centered around some kind of movie or tv show or book series.  Just onces I want my family to band around something that DOESN\u2019T have to do with media or these nerdy things. We live in Utah where we have like 5 National Parks and even though I ask every year for my birthday I\u2019VE NEVER EVEN BEEN TO ARCHES!!!!  Well my sister called me saying that mom was angry and to just come home and to stop with the theatrics. I told her that I\u2019m sick of having all this old \u201cnerd\u201d stuff crammed down my throat and just once I want to have a normal time watching normal Christmas movies and not having to pause for \u201clightsabre battles\u201d.\u201d AITA?!??! **HEY GUYS** I know you think you're cool and in on the joke wink wink when you DM me and ask me for my name, but I'm a teenage girl and that's not really how it's coming across. Please stop DMing me I don't care. **for those of you telling me in dms IRC didn't do fandom it was part of a livejournal community. Someone in the community had a fan site they all liked. It had a chatroom. I'm sure there was other stuff too?",

        "selftext": "So my daughter recently turned seven, and for our \u201cfamily part\u201d she asked for a penutbutter and chocolate cake. I agreed.  I let my sister know not to bring my nephew (3) because of his allergy. (It\u2019s so bad that he can\u2019t even be near/breathe in peanutbutter particles).  She asked if I would change the cake to be just chocolate so that my nephew could come. I said no, that it was my daughter\u2019s cake and she can have peanutbutter if she wants. She called me unreasonable because my daughter could have had peanutbutter cake with her \u2018friend party\u2019 (she didn\u2019t have cake with her friends, she just had pizza). She said that my daughter needs to learn to compromise for the sake of family. I told her that I would talk to my daughter, but not to expect a seven year old to choose her baby cousin over her favorite cake.  My conversation with my daughter played out just like I predicted, and when I told my sister, she called my daughter selfish and ungrateful. She said that I\u2019m a bad parent because I \u201ctaught her to hate (nephew)\u201d. She threatened that if my nephew wasn\u2019t welcome, that neither she nor her husband would come either. I said that was fine, because she wasn\u2019t welcome either.  I then reached out to my BIL to let him know what was going on and to tell him he was still welcome if he wanted to come. He thanked me, but said that he would stay home to support my sister.  Her party came and went, and my sister is still being very distant and cold. This has me wondering if I was too harsh to her and my nephew, or too soft on my daughter. AITA?",

        "selftext": "I (27f) have chosen to walk down the aisle alone on my wedding day. The decision was made for two reasons. My dad died when I was 7 and he would be my number one choice if he were alive but he's not and two, my mom has made it perfectly clear that she would find it disrespectful to my stepdad if she walked me down the aisle and so would not do it. Given that both my parents are out and I don't want to ask my paternal grandparents to do too much, my grandma and I are already sharing a special dance, walking alone is what I feel the most comfortable doing. I could ask my stepdad and even when I contemplated my decision, I knew he would want to do it. But it would make me sad to have him walk me instead of my dad if I'm honest. I think my stepdad is a good man and he has tried his very best to be a dad for me. But I didn't want a dad when I lost mine. I wanted my dad. Nobody else was ever going to be able to fill that role in my heart. I asked my mom and stepdad if they would like to do a joint toast or two separate ones and whether they would like to walk down the aisle/dance to specific songs. While discussing this my stepdad asked who I would be walking with and I told him I was walking alone. He offered to do it and I said it was a lovely offer but I would walk alone. He pressed me on why and I said it felt like the best option. He said it would mean the world to him if he could do it, if just once he could feel like he's a real dad and not just second place to my dad. I told him I understood but it was not an option on the table. He said he was already being shamed by having to watch me dance with my grandma when it should be a father/daughter dance. But to have everyone watch me walk alone when they know I have a stepdad is going to send a very big message.  I know people will ask about details on our relationship, etc. I met my stepdad when I was 9 and he married my mom when I was 10. He offered to adopt me and give me his last name and I turned him down five times in the 8 years I lived with them. He was married before my mom and he lost his wife and unborn baby in an accident. He was also made sterile by the same accident. He always longed to be a dad. We got along well but our relationship was always more to him than it was to me. Where he sees a daughter and wants a daughter, I see a good man and someone who is a great spouse to my mom and is good to me, but does not fill the father role he wants to emotionally for me. Physically, he did. But emotionally I never felt like he was my dad and everyone in our lives is aware that I feel as though I have one dad and my stepdad is my stepdad. My mom and stepdad are not paying or contributing to the wedding in any way. My fianc\u00e9 and I both have savings and we're putting those into the wedding. Though our wedding will be smallish since we want to prioritize other things. My mom and stepdad say I am rude and heartless for turning down the offer. AITA?",

        "selftext": "So for the past month, my (36) husband (39) has waking up at 5 every night to have a walk. These walks would take about 2 hours, Side note to mention that this new, he's not trying to lose weight (pretty thin) he's not athletic by nature nor has sports interests or hobbies. infact, he hated doing any type of sport. I'm happy for him since it's an overall positive thing. but yesterday, he came home in the evening after working for long hours then stayed up late playing with his phone. I went to bed at 10 after getting done with the mess and everything. I woke up by him yelling at me at 7 am asking me why I didn't wake him up for his 5am walk. He said he missed it and I'm responsible for that. I was so confused I said that first of all, he always wakes up by setting his alarm, why should I be expected to wake him up this time. He yelled that he forgot to set his alarm. I said so what? it's no big deal it's not like....he missed an important meaning or something but he got more angry and said that those walks help imrove his health and restore his energy and help him feel better. I made a comment about how missing one walk won't hurt but he unloaded on yelling about how I was trying to prevent him for doing his hobby for some unknown reason. I told him he was sorely mistaken even though I admit that those daily 5am walks around the veteran's park are weird but also his reaction? I really thought it was over the top. He stormed off and went to shower saying I ruined his entire day. When he got out he started avoiding and ignoring me. Even when I talk to him directly. he went to work and refused to respond to my calls. Really, I'm at a loss like maybe it was something I said about his walks. but I really don't know. he's sulking nonstop as of now and I'm literally about to lose my mind. AITA?",

Because I know sh*t happens and if anything goes wrong, or not exactly how we wanted, it's not that big of a deal and may even make the wedding more memorable for the guests.  The one thing that I told my husband I didn't want to happen was I didn't want him smashing cake in my face.  I had a suspicion that he would find it funny to do it, so during the planning, I flat out told him not to do it.  I don't think it's funny, I don't want to mess up my makeup that took hours to apply, and I don't want cake on my expensive wedding dress.  I told him I would be livid if he did it.  He promised that he wouldn't. Well, come the cake cutting time, what did he do?  Smashed the cake in my face!  It got on my dress, and messed up my makeup, just like I knew it would.  I'm pretty sure his friends convinced him to do it, not that that makes it any better.  I kept it together, went and cleaned myself up, and put on a smile for the rest of the reception.  But afterwards, I let loose on him.  I yelled at him that this was the ONE THING I asked him not to do, and he promised that he wouldn't.  He told me I was being dramatic, that it's not a big deal, and we should just be enjoying our time as newlyweds.  So was I being overly dramatic?  AITA?",

        "selftext": "Background: My (40sf) husband (40sm) and I bought a 3-bedroom house a few years ago, shortly before the panini. We of course took the master bedroom, and the other two bedrooms went to our children (then 12f and 10m). We put a very nice double bed in the larger room, and a single bed in the smaller room, and told them both that they could choose their rooms, but whoever ended up in the larger room may be asked to share or relocate for visiting family members, while whoever ended up in the smaller room would have it to themself always.  We almost never have family over (hubby and I are both only children, and our parents are in other provinces), so we were surprised when our older daughter chose the smaller room, and our younger son chose the larger room. But ok, they worked it out between themselves, both seemed happy with the choice, so ok. And it has remained that way for a couple of years.  Now, we have a 4-day weekend coming up (my kids are now 15f and 12m), and my mother decided to come down to visit. Of course, we told her ok (my husband and I), as we hadn't seen each other in awhile, and I told our son (with the larger room and bed) that grandma would be here for a few days, and would be using his bed.  Well, my son threw a fit. He didn't want to share a room with grandma, not even on an air mattress, not even for 3 nights, she smells funny. So we reminded him of the original deal, and offered to put the air mattress in the living room, but that wasn't enough, he'd have no privacy there. His sister offered to let him put the air mattress in her room (which she wasn't required to do), and that wasn't ok either. My husband and I offered to let him put the air mattress in our room, and he said no to that (because sharing a room with your parents, yugh! god bless the privilege, but whatever).  Finally, I put my foot down and said, the condition of you having the bigger room was that you'd give it up for visiting family members. So one way or another, you're sleeping on an air mattress for 3 nights. You can choose if the air mattress goes in your room or our room or the living room, or literally any room in this house, but you are sleeping on an air mattress while grandma is here.  Shortly after that confrontation, my husband came to me and suggested that we encourage my mom to stay in a hotel. I asked him who was going to pay for that hotel, since she can't afford it, we can't afford to put her up, and he went silent. Now he's calling me TA for forcing our son to give up his room for all of three nights, and suggesting that I tell my mom not to come at all since apparently none of us can afford it. Edit: I sincerely appreciate everyone's comments and judgements, but I have officially reached the point where every time I look at my notifications, it adds 2 every second without me even having to hit refresh. Clearly I should've posted this on my main account, since apparently reddit karma is important in some way. Lol. To follow the common AITA trend and respond to some common themes: 1. Why don't I offer my own (and my husband's) bed to my mom? My husband has back problems, so also cannot viably sleep on an air mattress. I will not be going into detail on this. I also assume that it will be incredibly obvious to everyone why it is not viable for my husband and my mother to sleep in a bed together while I sleep on an air mattress. Not to mention that she would never allow me to give up my bed for her as a visitor.  2. Why doesn't my mom sleep on the couch/air mattress?  She's 83 years old. Need I say more?  3. Anything involving my son and daughter switching rooms. My daughter is willing to help in the short term, but she seems a bit smug right now about the overall room choice, so she has no desire to switch rooms. And I will not force her, because what kind of parent would I be if I hold my son to the letter of his deal, but go back on my word to my daughter? You may decide I'm TA, and I'll accept that, but I am not a hypocrite.  4. I am fully aware of the privacy a 12yo boy requires, we've had that conversation, and (at the prompting of a couple commenters), I have also recently asked my husband if there was a private conversation between him and my son that would in some way change this situation. He said no. Since I do not currently have any reason to believe my husband would lie to me outright, I'm considering that conversation closed. 5. Rip my dms, apparently? Lol, I didn't know that happened to 40-something married moms, but please know that I am not interested.",

He moved in with us and brought his twin daughters (Olivia & Sloane18) with him a couple of months ago.His sister (my wife) and I have one daughter (Zoey 16) and she and her cousins aren't close but get along fine. Olivia & Sloane have no respect for Zoey's privacy, none. they used to walk into her room and take everything they get their hands on. Makeup, phone accessories, clothes, school laptop etc. Zoey complained a lot and I've already asked the girls to respect Zoey's privacy and stop taking things. My wife and Sammy saw no issue with this. After all, they're girls and this's typical teenage girls behavior. I completely disagreed.  Last straw was when Zoey bought a 60$ m.a.c makeup-kit that looks like a paintset that she saved up for over a month and one of the girls, Sloane took it without permission and ruined it by mixing shades together while using it. Don't know much about makeup but that's what Zoey said when she found the kit on her bed, and was crying.I told my wife and she said she'd ask Sloane to apologize but I got Zoey a lock after I found she was moving valuable belongings out the house because of this incidence!!! Sammy and his daughters saw the lock and weren't happy, the girls were extremely upset.Sammy asked about it and I straight up told him. He said my daughters aren't thieves!!! it's normal that girls of the same age borrow each others stuff he said Zoey could easily get another makeup kit for 15 bucks from walmart and shouldn't even be buying expensive - adult makeup in the first place and suggested my wife take care of this defect in Zoey's personality trying to appear older than she is.He accused me of being overprotective and babying Zoey with this level of enablement. I told him this's between me and my wife but she shamed me for putting a lock on Zoey's door for her cousins to see and preventing them from spending time with her saying I was supposed to treat them like daughters, then demanded I remove it but I said this lock does not get removed til her brother and his daughters are out of our house. She got mad I was implying we kick them out and said her family'll hate me for this. so I reminded her that I let Sammy and his family move in which's something her OWN family refused to do so she should start with shaming/blaming them for not taking their own son and nieces/granddaughters in. if it wasn't for her family's unwillingness to help we wouldn't be dealing with this much disturbance at home. Everyone's been giving me and Zoey silent treatment and my wife is very much upset over this.",

        "selftext": "I'm a newly divorced dad of a 3 year old girl. I have her every other week. My daughter has very curly hair that my ex wife used to take care of. Now that I'm alone with her half the time, I have to figure it out. I try but on my weeks her hair was mostly a frizzy, tangled mess. A teacher at my daughter's daycare has very similar hair to my daughter's so I asked if she could help me with my daughter's hair. She said she could do my daughter's hair in the mornings if I dropped her off earlier (dropoff starts at 8, I usually drop her off at 8:45 but her teacher says if I drop her off by 8:20 she'll be able to take care of her hair). She gave me a list of curly hair products to buy and what to bring to school. She also gave me some tips for washing and caring for it at home. I guess my daughter told my ex that her teacher does her hair, not me, and that she goes to daycare early now because my ex called me and asked if I really drop her off a half hour early every morning just so I could avoid doing her hair. She called me a bad parent for relying on a teacher to do my job and for messing up the morning routine so we could get to school early enough for the teacher to do her hair (we used to wake up, give her a bath, I'd attempt to do her hair, we'd have breakfast, then go to school but now we wake up, take a bath, and eat breakfast in the car). I thought I was doing right by making sure her hair is cared for on my weeks but my ex feels very strongly about this so I wanted to know if I was the asshole. Edit: I'm going to add some things to the post that I'm seeing in the comments. I am learning how to care for her hair. Her hair is healthier now than it was a few weeks ago. I have her hair down on the weekends because I still suck at styling it but it still looks good. The teacher really seems to enjoy doing her hair. I know she does other kids' hair but it's not exactly a set thing. Lastly, my ex was not willing to teach me how to do her hair when we were married and is not willing to teach me after the divorce.",

Currently, I'm married to my wife who has adaughter (16) Britney So, Britney is the opposite of Olivia. for example, Britney s a social kid, Olivia is introvert. the list is long but they're just the complete oposite. Olivia's 13th birthday was 2 days ago. She loves chocolate and I decided this is the flavor I was going to go with when I contacted the bakery. However, my wife objected since Britney absolutely hates chocolate and suggested we go with Vanilla. I said no way because for one, Olivia hates vanilla and it's also her birthday so, she gets to have her cake with her favorites flavor. My wife got upset and took it as in I had no regard for Britney and that we should just choose another netural flavor instead. I shut that down and said no more discussing this because I'd already decided to go with what Olivia wanted. At the day of the birthday, I was supposed to go get the cake but I was surprised to see my wife coming home after picking up the cake from the bakery. I looked at it and discovered that it wasn't a chocolate cake but a vanilla cake with small pieces of chocolate on top. I got pissed thinking they got my order wrong and was about to contact them, but my wife said there was no mistake and that she called the bakery the day before and made slight changes to the cake to please both girls. I was stunned I lost it on her and asked why the hell she did that. She got defensive saying that birthdays are no excuse to show favoritism and that her daughter is watching and observing how I'm treating both girls. I told her off since I was the one paying then called the bakery and explained what happened. I had the cake returned and replaced with a chocolate cake. although this one is smaller but it was fine. My wife declined to take part in the celebration and later we got into a huge argument where she called me controlling and selfish for returing the cake instead of using this opportunity to teach Olivia to compromise so everyone's happy. now I'm teaching her to be selfish. I said that my daughter gets to act selfish on her birthday and that she (my wife) was teaching her daughter to be entitled. Word for word and it led to a bigger argument. We're not talking as of now. AITA for returning the cake and not taking my wife's input into consideration?",

I have recently started to have an American live with me, and she introduces herself to people as Irish. Now, I know Americans do this weird thing where they believe they are where their ancestors came from. We Europeans find this hilarious, but what ya gonna do? Recently, I have been researching my family history and she got involved. She is now saying that I should go around saying I am Irish otherwise it is disrespectful to my ancestors. The problem is I am not Irish. I am English. I don't know Irish culture. I have never been to Ireland. I am English. I would argue she isn't Irish either since she has never been to Ireland nor knows Irish culture but, still, she can introduce herself however she wants. She is getting incredibly upset that I am refusing to say I am Irish and she has even started to introduce me as her Irish friend. I told her to stop, and she got annoyed I mean, where do you draw the line on ancestors anyway? Should I introduce myself as African before all my ancestors started out in Africa? No. So, AITA for not saying I am Irish?",

She does a lot of orders for wedding cakes that require custard or marmalade fillings, and I offered to help her out by making these fillings at home and bringing them to her so she has less work to do. Unfortunately, the past four times I\u2019ve made these fillings, my girlfriend (F24) has literally dipped her fingers into the filling jars and contaminated them because, in her words, she \u201cjust wanted to try some.\u201d I\u2019ve tried explaining to her that she can\u2019t dip her fingers in and contaminate the entire batch, because then I have to remake it. I said she should use a spoon and take some out if she wants to try so bad, but she just pouts and says that she likes using her fingers because it takes her back to her childhood. Today, I was trying to finish some chocolate custard to send it over to my sister really fast because she was running late on a wedding cake order for an important client. I told my girlfriend beforehand to not eat the custard, and if she really wanted to, to please use a spoon.  I get out of the shower, and what do I see? She has her fingers in it again! I totally lost it because this is the fifth time she blatantly disregarded what I said, and I yelled at her and told her to \u201cstop fucking eating\u201d the food I\u2019m making, because it\u2019s not for her and she\u2019s contaminating it.  She started crying and got mad at me for \u201cfat-shaming\u201d her, even though I made no comment on her weight and she has no history of weight issues or eating disorders.

        "selftext": "My husband (Asian) and I (american) welcomed our first born 4 weeks ago. The baby is health (Thank God) but I'm exhausted, haven't fixed my hair, barely able to shower and can not sleep. My husband's family had been pressuring us to visit to meet the baby. I tried to hold them off as much as I could but yesterday, I was surprised to find them standing on the porch. turns out hubby invited them for dinner. I was embarrassed and felt like I wasn't ready for visitors (judgemental ones at that \ud83d\ude09) cause the house was a M.E.S.S y'all. Anyways, my husband sat with them while I fed my son then later I asked my husband if we should order take out for dinner. He said NO because his parents would find this rude and unwelcoming. He suggested that I go inside the kitchen and prepare something, anything long as it's homemade. I said fine then went and made some Mac N cheese. The reason I prepared this meal is because of how easy it is. Once I served the family, My husband's mom looked at me and was appalled. I noticed something was wrong. She asked if I really found it appropriate to serve her and the family Mac N cheese. I asked why not and she went on a rant about how disrespectful this was and that I clearly have no experience in what is right and wrong when it comes to hosting. I said excuse me? Who said I signed up to host an expected visit from them and she took it as in I didn't want them there. her husband said they were just there to finally see the baby that I kept them from seeing for an entire month. that's a whole month of his life they missed out on. We had an argument and they decided to go home. My husband said that deciding to serve his family Mac N cheese was more offensive then serving them nothing at all. I told him I was too exhausted to cook their traditional feasts that I was forced to learn from his mom. He took offense and said that I was being mean and disrespectful towards not only his family but his culture. I went inside the bedroom to stay with my son. My husband stayed on the phone with his family for an hour then kept giving me the cold shoulder and refused to eat what I cook in support of his family. I understand how some guests might find it offensive especially his family. but I was just trying to make a quick homemade meal like my husband wanted. What's wrong with Mac N cheese? EDIT* Ok, So I'm seeing commenters here offering to come over for some Mac N cheese. It's amazing to hear that some people here would aporeciate this kind of meal. It kinda makes me feel relieved and reassures me that I didn't mess this up entirely. Come on in Y'all! I'll be more than happy to serve you some mac n cheese, some of y'all even offered to bring mashed potatoes and pizza. LOL would love to have y'all over some time.",

        "selftext": "Hello Reddit! I have just downloaded Reddit because my niece said I should post this story to the AITA board so here I am! I am not very good with technology so forgive me but I'll probably be messing this whole post up! \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02  So basically here's what happened. Me and my wife hired our babysitter who we've been going to for years, we have 2 sons and a daughter and we've been hiring her since my oldest son was a baby (though it was mostly her mom looking after the baby while she was 'helping' so we gave her a couple of dollars for that \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02). She's now 16 and can look after the kids all on her own and my oldest two love her! (My youngest is only 7 months so I'm not sure he really gets it yet \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02, but he seems relatively happy when he's with her).  This Friday my kids daycare has been closed for renovations and Daisy (our babysitter) has kindly offered to take care of them after school, from 3:30-6pm! I get home from work at 6 and my wife gets home at half 6, however, I got home early from work at half five, when I got home I found my wife yelling at Daisy while Daisy was just sobbing and apologizing, I asked my wife what was going on and all she did was just start yelling that Daisy had cost us a bunch of money, my first thought was that she'd broken something, but my wife wasn't telling me what it was. She told Daisy she wouldn't be paying her for her time and to get the f*ck out of our house and never come back or she'd call the police. Daisy then ran out crying and I left my wife to calm down while I comforted my kids (they were all crying in a different room while my wife yelled at Daisy). When everything had calmed down, I got the full story from my wife.  So here's what happened: My mother had been looking after the kids until 3:30 while we were at work. This was Daisy's first time looking after my youngest son, though we knew we could trust her with the babies since she looked after my daughter alone when she was a baby. Something important that you should know is that my youngest son has breath holding episodes, which occur when he gets frustrated or is in pain, and he will just hold his breath, to stop them you just have to blow on the baby or they will just snap out of it on their own, they're completely normal and relatively safe in babies, however, the episodes can sometimes cause passing out and blueness, and it's normal and he usually wakes up within a few seconds. To cut a long story short my mom forgot to tell Daisy what to do if that happens, and when my son passed out, Daisy panicked and called 911, and then my wife. My wife is now angry that Daisy called 911 for 'nothing' and has now wasted our money on an ambulance ride. Me and my wife are now arguing because I think Daisy did the right thing but my wife doesn't, yesterday we got into a heated argument, we both said some hurtful stuff and she is now staying with her mother for a few days while she 'thinks over my priorities in the relationship'.

        "selftext": "Yeah, I know this sounds awful. My (32M) wife's (35F) daughter (16F) recently announced she is pregnant.  She claims she doesn't know who the father is. I suspect she actually does and doesn't want to say, for whatever reason. I mean how much unprotected sex is a 16 year old really having? It can't be that hard to narrow it down for goodness sake. Anyway, moving on. She is adamant on keeping the baby. Abortion is out of the question apparently. Wife completely supports her decision and is excited about having her first grand kid. They're both ecstatic. The problem I have with this is: 1. My wife's daughter is not going to be the one to look after this kid. She's still in school and fully intends to go to college. My wife and I will 100% end up looking after it. 2. I am going to be the one paying tens of thousands of dollars to raise this kid. My wife works part time and makes very little money. I don't have a problem with this as it lets her do volunteer work that she enjoys, but it means the financial burden of this kid will be 100% on me. 3. I wanted to have at least one kid with my wife. She's entering her late 30s so it's now or never. I feel like this kid will mean the two of us will never have our own because of both the emotional and financial burden raising it will put on us. I raised my concerns with my wife and her response was expected but disappointing. This isn't up to you. This is her decision to make. We will support her. I agree it's her decision, but why do I have to support her? As it stands now, I'm thinking of cutting my losses and leaving the marriage if her daughter has this child. I'm not prepared to put off starting my own family for the sake of her daughter, nor am I prepared to pay to raise it. I fully intend to let them know this before the baby is born so they can make an informed decision on whether they can support it. AITA?",

My birth dad John was married to my mom for a few years, then she left my dad and yeah. They ended up divorcing and now she's somewhere in California, idk where or what she's doing. Haven't talked to her in ages.  So dad, and pops i'm super close with. They are the best parents any child could ask for. I love both of them and they've always been with me. My dad introduced me to pops when i was a little boy and they had told me they were in a relationship (and i was all for it because i had saw my dad become lonely/sad when he was single) so seeing the fact that my dad loves someone and has a life partner made me super happy.  Pops & Dad got married, and we've been living an amazing life. I'm probably more to close to Pops then my own dad haha. Due to the fact that Pops is really cool and he's laid back. I love both of them equally and they love me as well, and i'm blessed to have them as parents. For a few months i've been dating this girl bella who's my age. I thought she's pretty cute and i liked her. So we kicked it and recently she told me My parents want to meet your parents and want to come over for dinner I said sure. I'll tell my family.  So yesterday, Friday night. Bella comes in. Pops greets her and says Come on in sweetheart, dinner is ready. She says You must be ____ dad so good to meet you and she shakes his hand and she sees Dad come out of the kitchen He's holding the mac n cheese tray with the mittens and is putting it on the table. Then bella says Who's he? i said, Oh that's my dad. She said I though he's your dad she's referring to Pops. I say yeah. That's my pops? And that's my dad? She pulls me to the side and says I didn't know your parents are gay? Oh my god? why didn't you tell me? I genuinely didn't know why, that'd be an issue or so. Because your dating me, not my parents and all. So it shouldn't matter. But i guess it's a concern for her. Her parents come at the door after they parked the car and bella tells her parents let's leave and they left. I told my parents i'm sorry and they said son don't worry this is nothing new haha and then we all sat down and enjoyed dinner and went to sleep.  So AITA for not telling?",

        "selftext": "I (38F) bought a 4 bedroom house in semi-rural Buckinghamshire when I was 23. It was a lovely big house, but the town was not fun for a 23 year old. I always said I'd love it of I were 40 with kids, but it wasn't a great place for someone in their 20s. When I was 26, I put the house on the rental market and moved to London where I lived for 2 years before moving to Australia.  I found a lovely family to rent the house. A husband and wife both in their mid to late 40s with one child, no pets, and respectable jobs. Rent was always paid on time, the estate agent always had good reports from inspection visits and we never heard ant complaints from neighbours.  FF 14 years later, they're still living there. I've been travelling the world full time for some years, spent the pandemic in Australia then resumed travelling post lock downs. I'm now ready to return home, so I informed my estate agent that I want to break the contract and have them move out in 3 months' time, 2 months more notice than I'm obligated to give.  The tenants were surprised to hear I was coming back and tried to ask if I was coming to live with my family. The agent brushed off question and told them to vacate in 3 months and that they can help find alternative accommodation. Tenants texted me directly to ask same question and I replied haha, no husband or kids in tow - just ready to set roots again! Looking forward to being home (I grew up 20 mins aways). I got a text calling me selfish for: kicking them out of their home of nearly 15 years; wanting a big house all to myself; placing my needs of travel and enjoyment ahead of starting a family and getting married. They told me I should leave them to buy the house for what I bought it for (it's doubled in price since) and go live in my other house. I replied you can dictate in a house that you own, not one that I own. Please have your things packed by x date or I'll evict you and sue you for the costs.  My friends are saying I'm kicking them out of their home and I don't need such a big place so I can rent or sell my student flat for a deposit for a house nearby. My rented house is 90% paid though and I don't want to start again with a new mortgage. I want to live in my house. I have been fair to the tenants and reasonable in my request. AITA? Recently learnt of the edit feature haha.  Okay, thank you for the feedback. I will be asking the estate agent to ask what ways I can help make this transition easier. I'm willing to extend the notice period by a few months if they want to. Thank you to those who remained civil in their disagreement. Bye :)",

        "selftext": "I (26f) recently moved into my first home. I am also 4 months pregnant with our first baby. The pregnancy has been very hard. I have horrible morning sickness. It reached a really bad point where I passed out hit my head and my Dr admitted me to the hospital for a week.  When I got home my husband allowed his brothers family to move into 2 of our 3 bedrooms. (They were evicted i dont know why). One room was My office was tossed into our room papers every where. The house was a complete wreck. Trash, dirty clothes, used diapers. I started to cry. It was like a light flipped my husband was no longer the same.  My husband told me it wasn't that bad. My reply was fine then you should have the house cleaned up before I wake up. Completly exhaustedI fell asleep for 4 hrs. I woke up and went to get a drink of water. I couldn't every glass we own is scattered around the house. They didnt clean a single thing. I passive aggressively started to pick up the dirty dishes and washed them. The following morning. I was trying my best to work when their kids were crying non stop. Banging on the walls so on. Their mom was in her room for hours ignoring them.   When my husband came home. He was upset with me over how I didn't make his brother's wife feel welcome in our home. By helping with their kids when she was tired. Then continued to complain how nothing was done while he was at work all day in the house. Yep the same one he didn't clean. That lead to a fight where I told him. I am too sick to have company and they need to leave.  To which he replied they are his family and he won't kick them out. I started to cry again.  I was beyond frustrated, exhausted, I physically couldnt do it anymore. I called my mom asking if I could come stay with her. Telling her the whole story infront of my husband. Who at this point was completely shocked, Angry, also I could tell he wasnt sure what to do. My mom came with my brother's (I have 3 older brothers). My mom super angry told my husband. Since your family can stay so can we. My mom quickly took charge. I was sent to bed. My brother's started cleaning complaining loudly at how disgusting my BIL family is. Along with what a horrible husband my husband is for putting me through this while I am sick. I got a text message from my MIL for calling me an A for not helping my husband clean up the house and putting my BIL in a uncomfortable position by having my mom boss him around. Edited to add update, when my MIL showed up she was super angry outside. I could hear shouting but, couldn't understand what was said. Once inside she was shocked. My house looked really bad. My BIL lied to her about what happened. My MIL quickly started to help my mom in the bossing mode.My house is not just cleaned but deep cleaned. My BIL and his kids are now staying with MIL. She didn't know about the eviction. My in-laws helped them financially a couple of months ago. My MIL was not happy about it. SIL refused to come out of the bedroom. She would scream through the door but that was about it until her family came to pick her up. Last little bit. I did talk to my husband. He seemed very remorseful. I asked for some space he is staying at a hotel. He asked to come by and talk to me tonight.  My mom and dad are here. Both mom's felt like I should have someone here since I am sick.Both moms have set up a meal plan. Where they trade off who will bring in dinner. It was my MIL idea. Thank you for all your advice. I truly appreciate it. Talk with husband: summed up since it lasted 4 hrs.  it was a hard talk.  He is remorseful.Bil was only supposed to stay for a couple of nights. Then leave originally he thought they would be gone before I got home. He said he is tired and emotionally upset himself. When I originally passed out. My husband left to help a friend move. He came home and found me. He said he has no idea how long I was on the floor hurt. He was originally scared I had died.Since then he has had nightmares. On top of dealing with his family drama. He admitted to dumping his frustration onto me. When it's not my fault. He begged me for another chance. The next steps. We are still separated. He plans on staying at my brother house in his casita. We are going to go to marriage counseling and Individual counseling. He asked if he could come when the home health nurse comes each night and to my Dr's appointments. I agreed to that. Update on BIL: his wife admitted to having and affair. She told him she got married too soon and doesn't want the responsibilities of being a mom anymore. I am not sure what will happen with him and his kids but, I am shocked that she feels this way especially with her kids.",

        "selftext": "Throwaway account. Me (35m) and my gf, Sara (35f) have been together for 4 years. She has a son, Nathan (9m), with her ex Mark (36m). Sara has full  custody of Nathan with her ex having scheduled visitations one weekend of every month. Sara and Nathan moved in with me a little over a year and a half ago and in my perspective, it was a little rocky at first. I've always been pretty protective of my space so making room for two other people was difficult for me. When Sara moved in with me we agreed that the visitations for Mark would be held in our apartment as long as I'm home. The main reason I wanted this is because I don't know Mark that well, and I don't want him wandering around our apartment without me there. When we proposed this idea to Mark, he was fine with it. Now moving on to the real issue. Three weeks ago marked four months since Mark's last visit so I had asked Sara when he was planning on visiting Nathan. My gf replied by shrugging her shoulders and telling me she'd ask. She never followed up with it. So a few days ago, I asked when Mark's next visit was and Sara said she'd tell me when she knew. Nathan was in the living room but had apparently overheard us and shouted something along the lines of dad was here last weekend remember. Sara's face immediately dropped and when I asked what Nathan meant, she wouldn't give me a direct answer. Eventually she ended up telling me that for the past two visits, Mark had been to our apartment when I was working. When I accused her of going back on our agreement, she kept telling me this was her home too and she could invite whoever she wanted, and that it was fine because she was here and watching. I told her that was besides the point and she violated my trust. It blew up into a huge argument with ended in me telling her to get out of my apartment. She packed up and left with Nathan. Last I heard she was staying with her parents. I've gotten several messages from both Sara and her parents calling me an asshole for kicking Sara and Nathan out of their home for something so small. She's even been blasting me on Instagram and Facebook about how horrible I am to do this to her. It's got me thinking I might be the AH but I'm not entirely sure yet. AITA? ETA: I can see why it's important but the court order was instructed because of Mark having a criminal record. I'm not sure what it's for as Sara has never directly told me and I didn't want to push her to tell me.   Eta 2: Update posted to my account.",

        "selftext": "This whole situation has gotten way out of hand to the point everyone is yelling at everyone and I\u2019m sleeping in the guest bedroom. My wife\u2019s parents are at the point in their lives where they can no longer live by themselves. Their children decided the best place for them is an assisted living facility. They started to look into different facilities and admittedly, I didn\u2019t help because I figured the 5 adult siblings could handle it and I was never close to my in-laws. They found one that was perfect and my wife was very excited when she told me about it. I was less than thrilled when I found out our contribution will be roughly $3,000 upfront then $5,000 a month. I immediately question why it cost roughly $15,000 upfront fee and $25,000 a month for 2 people in an assisted living apartment. I admit I sarcastically asked if their apartment is next door to Elon Musk\u2019s parents. She then told me that we\u2019re going to cover the lion\u2019s share of the costs because we make more than her siblings. That was the beginning of a week of texts, phone, and in-person arguments. She argues that her siblings make less money combined than we do and some are single so it would impact them more thus so it\u2019s only fair we pay more. She also argues that this facility is not the best or most expensive, it\u2019s a mid tier one with the best ratings. According to her, anything lower have bad ratings and could put her parents\u2019 safety in jeopardy. My argument is that there are 5 siblings so the costs should be divided equally between the 5 of them. I also argued that if 5 people can\u2019t afford that place, they need to lower their standards. That started a circular argument for hours between cost and safety. I couldn\u2019t take it anymore and in the heat of the moment, I yelled, \u201cwe don\u2019t make more that your brothers and sisters, I make more than all of you which is why you all want me to cover the cost for YOUR parents!\u201d That was the beginning of my nights sleeping in the guest bedroom. I know as a married couple I shouldn\u2019t consider \u201cmine\u201d and \u201cyours\u201d income but realistically I do make more than all of them and I think it\u2019s unfair to make me pay the largest portion. What do you all think? Update I\u2019m going to answer some questions. 1. I assumed it was $25,000 a month because I assumed it was split 5 ways between the siblings and our share was $5,000 a month. It\u2019ll be closer to $10,000 a month and our share is $5,000. 2. Her parents have assets including a house so I was told they don\u2019t qualify for government assistance. I brought up the idea of selling their house but was shot down immediately. The siblings want to keep the house in the family because their great grandfather built it or something. 3. I can afford to pay it but I don\u2019t want to based on principle. Their division means I\u2019ll be paying $5,000 a month while the youngest brother will be paying only $300 a month and will be living in the house. Their thinking is that he\u2019ll be paying the insurance and taxes on the house so he can\u2019t afford more than $300. Another update  4. I\u2019m the only child to my parents. While they planned out their retirement, they worked their entire lives to put me through school and supported me through several degrees. I will be solely responsible for and will make sure their remaining days will be comfortable. 5. Per your suggestion, I asked my wife if we\u2019re going contribute this much money to her parents, how they\u2019re going to contribute to my parents when their time comes. She answered, \u201cdon\u2019t be an idiot, that\u2019s an entirely different situation.\u201d 6. I don\u2019t want ownership of their house because it\u2019s very old and needs major work. I brought up the idea of selling the house again and it was shot down again. They\u2019re not budging on it. 7. None of us know the laws and regulations when it comes to this so I finally got her to agree for us to sit down with an estate attorney.  8. Unless I feel up to it, this is probably the last update. I feel completely emotionally drained. I always knew my parents would get old but I never thought about it.",

        "selftext": "For some reason my 14 year old son cannot wipe properly.  This was never a concern to me as his mom did the laundry.   Unfortunately she is sick right now so I have taken over the household chores that she used to handle.  My son is still responsible for his and I do mine as well as hers.   First day I did laundry I gagged and almost puked from his underwear.  If he were three and not fully potty trained I might understand how they end up like this.  But he is a healthy young man.  He should not be leaving his ass this unwiped.   I talked to him about it and he said he would make an effort to do a better job.  Nope. No change in the situation.  So I went to the hardware store and installed a wand bidet in the bathroom he uses.  We already have one in ours.  I told him that he has a choice of either using the bidet or washing his own underwear.  He doesn't know how to use the washing machine and he refuses to do them by hand.  He started going commando.  Which just meant the problem was his jeans now.   So I said that we might need to take him to the doctor to see what is wrong with him.  If it's physical or psychological.  I also said that the next time his friends were over I was going to ask them is they left their underwear in the same condition.  I WOULD NEVER ACTUALLY EMBARRASS HIM LIKE THAT. He said I was being an asshole and he called his mom to tell her what I was doing.  She said that he was just like that and I could deal with it until she was better.   I don't think that's a great plan.  If this kid never learns to wipe his ass he will be bereft of a sexual partner without a poop fetish.  I'm not kinkshaming him if that's his thing.   He has started using the bidet but he says that it is gross and weird.  I said it was grosser and weirder for a 14 year old to crap his pants every day.  We are both stressed about his mom but this situation isn't because of her. I asked her.",

        "selftext": "I\u2019m an atheist who works in an international company in a very busy city.  I have a lot of coworkers who come from a certain religious background that requires them to pray multiple times a day. I would say 90% of my coworkers share this faith and maybe 70-80% of them take the time out to go pray everyday.  They get to leave the office 2 or 3 times in a day for 10 mins a piece for prayer and they get paid the same, don\u2019t need to take time out of their lunch, etc.   I used to resent this and asked my boss who belongs to that faith why they were essentially having an extra paid 30 min break a day for doing the same work I do. She couldn\u2019t give me a response other than religious considerations have to be made.  Even though I\u2019m a known atheist I decided I too wanted some time to meditate everyday. I told my manager I needed the same time as my coworkers and told her it was very important to me. She initially said no, and then I got a hastily written email saying of course I was welcome to take that time to meditate the same day. She\u2019d obviously checked with HR and covered her ass.  For the last six months I\u2019ve been having my 30 mins \u2018meditating\u2019 out in our company garden everyday. This has caused a slight issue because other non religious people are starting to ask if they too can have \u2018meditative time\u2019 and it\u2019s causing friction but imo either everyone should be able to have this or no one should.  I recently told a friend this story and she reacted negatively- she said that I was being rude and \u2018ruining it\u2019 for everyone else and that at Xmas time my coworkers usually go over and beyond to fill in holiday hours so the rest of us can enjoy our holidays and that the same courtesy should be extended to them. I told her I\u2019m not hurting anybody or taking their prayer times away from them, simply enjoying that privilege myself.",

We went to a small mall, half the day on the bench. It was window shopping. She is obese, her ankles are swollen from her weight. The connection between her weight and not walking far without a break is very obvious. Post: I will try to keep this short. I have three girls and we still like to do girl trips for the day. My son got married to a girl named Beth. Now before her first kids she was average weight and after it got a lot worse. Her only kid is 8 years old at this point and she hasn\u2019t lost the weight. It\u2019s bad enough that she needs constant breaks walking.  I used to like her and now I don\u2019t due to how she acts. Everywhere we go with her it is constant complaining that she is tired. The last girls trip to the mall was spent sitting on a bench half the day since she needed constant break. If you try to leave she will go on about abandoning her. It\u2019s annoying. I invited the girls to go to a farm for pumpkin patch and pick some apples. It has big orchards and a ton of walking. We went it was a great time and some pictures went on Facebook.

I told her she wasn\u2019t invited due her weight. That she forces us to stop all the time and it ruins the trips most days since we don\u2019t get to do half the stuff.

The problem is that she has been randomly walking in on me while I'm in the bathroom. Thankfully not once has she seen me naked because I started picking up on her behavior after the second time in a week. She'd barge in, then turns and says oh sorry then close the door. I tried talking to my husband about it but he kept ignoring me then flatout said so what if she accidently seen you naked? She's faaaammmillly!!. He seriously said that!. We have a lock and I could've used it but I have past trauma from the idea of locking/being locked in a room after my brother locked me in the bathroom when I was 5. So I came up with this idea. I'd go inside the bathroom pretending to use it and wait for her to come (cause honestly? It's deliberate at the this point). When she accidently barges in she'd see me in a weird/awkward position. For example doing a ballet stand, standing on the toilet, or standing facing the wall with my hands up, (fully clothed of course). I could see how awkward and weird this would be for her because she'd stand there for few seconds trying to figure out what I was doing. It was halirious at first seeing her initial confusion but she told my husband about it claiming she's caught me practicing rituals in the bathroom. I cleared things up and revealed the reason why. My husband was livid. He called me childish and said that I made his mom feel terrified/weirded out by my behavior. He said I should've acted maturely and locked the damn door instead of playing mind games. Edit. Lol. Um what? I just came back on here and saw literally 1000s? of people? OMG now I feel embarrassed Glad I went anonymous Lol. But seriously...I'm looking at my screen and am like ....I'm famous? Seriously though...My husband and his mom are extremely upset with me. He still thinks it was ridiculous and is demanding an apology before she goes back to her home.  I'm not sure if I will apologize because yes while it was a me problem that I couldn't use the lock. It's still feels wrong what she did and maybe I'm wrong too but at least I got (so did you apparently lol) a bit of a chuckle out of it \ud83d\ude05\ud83e\udd23 also, I'm sure Thanksgiving dinner will hella awkward tomorrow.

Back info - We aren\u2019t dog people.  I\u2019ve had girlfriends end relationships with me over the fact I don\u2019t want a dog.  In the topic of pets, my current spouse is very compatible.  They just aren\u2019t our thing and our friends know this about us.  Like we aren\u2019t the type to pet them all.   A key part of this story, nearly every restaurant has patios that are dog friendly while indoors is not.  Its nearly impossible to find non pet friendly patios.  \r  \r  Our friends however are now pet people.  They got a dog over covid. They\u2019ve become the people that take it every where with them. My fianc\u00e9 and I do hang out with them less because of it.  We showed up about 10 minutes early for our reservation.  I intended to eat indoors.  Turns out our friends beat us here.  We were led to a patio table and see they brought their dog.  I say no, I\u2019m not doing this. What are you thinking bringing that? \r  \r  Fiance and I went inside to see if the bar had any seats, and my buddy chased us  down.  Explains the dog sitter fell through and the dog will just lay their and not bother us.  I don\u2019t care, mentioned not sure why they need a sitter and we aren\u2019t spending our meal with a dog.  Told him its fucked up you spring your dog on us. \r  \r  There were no bar seats, so fianc\u00e9 and I decided to leave.  My buddy said I\u2019m an asshole.  I told him I\u2019m not spending time with you dog.  We\u2019ll figure somewhere else out to go.  I got texts saying how fucked up what we did was.  Am I the Asshole here?\r  ",

        "selftext": " I f32 been dating John m37 for 2 years. He's a single dad to 3 kids [4m (jr) ,6m,9m]. I moved in with him and his kids a little while ago. I gave to say that he's super protective of his kids, I haven't been able to meet them til later because he said they might not like me and so he started easing them into accepting me by encouraging me and pushing me to be extra friendly to them by buying them stuff and cooking for them daily. He's very busy often times, and the boys have now clinged on to me because they see me more than they see him. Don't get me wrong; I'm grateful for this outcome but the issue is that I can't be away from them for a long time. More than hours. Now that I'd moved in I can't go anywhere without taking them with me. I can barely have time for myself but what's worse is that my work got interrupted by that. John suggested I work less hours but it didn't happen. Now my sister is getting married soon. It'll be held hours away so I'll have to travel. The invitation stated child-free so I can't take the kids. When John heard about this he told me to immediately call and apologize cause I won't be attending. I was stunned I asked why and he went on about how much the kids adore me and how they'll go crazy when I'm hours away from them. besides, that he's too busy to look after them. I said it's not my fault and he should either take time off work and stay with them or get a babysitter. He threw a fit about how selfish and unfeeling I was and that he will only let me attend the wedding when I tell my sister to let the kids come but I can't ask such thing of her! I INSISTED on going after he kept saying I shouldn't go. He went and told the boys that I was looking for an excuse to get some time away from then and now they won't even speak to me. I confronted him about what he did and he said it's the result of me insisting on going to the wedding and choosing my sister over my stepkids. He even said I should be thankful the kids accept me for who I am and are giving me this much attention. I was speechless and felt offended. AITA for standing my ground and wanting to go? She's my only sister and we have a great relationship so not attending her wedding can cause issues. EDITING SOME INFORMATION: to answer the question about the biological mom. His eldest is from his late wife. He then dated his ex girlfriend and had his middle and youngest child with her. Now she's out of the picture. The eldest user to be kind of distant from his half brothers and had issues with them for years. I was left to navigate through that and help him re-bond with them. Like I said all of them like to spend time with me so as a result they are bonding together, which is a great thing. John was clearly too busy to try to fix this problem a long time ago.",

        "selftext": "So I (18f) am very lucky in that I have two very hardworking parents that are successful and love me. We aren't mega-wealthy but we are very comfortable as my parents are extremely smart financially. We own multiple houses as part of our real estate portfolio that we rent out for extra income. I recently started college and as a present for working hard and getting into my dream school my parents gifted me one of our houses that is near my college. I was going to inherit them all anyway but I really appreciated their gesture. Where I live real estate law is a little tricky and we would have to pay significant taxes to officially transfer the house to me so we decided to have my parents own it legally for now. The house is pretty big with 4 floors(including a fully furnished basement) and a roomy attic and since it is near my school I decided to look for roommates so I could start earning money early. So far I have two roommates, who we'll call Sasha(18f) and Bea(19f) who also go to my school. We have been living together for a couple months now(they moved in around August) and we are all pretty good friends, and very compatible roommates. This is where I might be the asshole. I didn't want to tell them that I own the house as I thought it might create a weird dynamic between us, and I didn't want them to view me any differently. We split the bills and rent, with me technically paying nothing. Since my father legally owns the house and we have different surnames(I took my mothers last name) they have no idea I own the house or that my dad just sends the money back to me. Sasha recently found the money my dad sent back while I was at class and told Bea, and they cornered me about it a few days ago. I told them everything and they're mad at me for hiding this from them and think I'm not only in the wrong for keeping it a secret but for making them pay rent in the first place. The house's mortgage has already been paid off so the rent goes entirely into my pocket. I responded by saying that they shouldn't have gone through my mail in the first place and that it was illegal, which I'll admit was kind of a low blow. We weren't friends when they moved in and the whole point of me wanting roommates was so that I could earn extra cash so I don't see why I should let them reside for free. AITA here? Edit 1: people in the comments were asking, basically we have a system where whoever is home brings all the mail in and puts it on the kitchen island. Bea brought the mail in but Sasha opened my mail before I got home. My dad doesn't send me straight up cash lol, he mails two cheques, with the amount Sasha and Bea paid, and when Sasha saw the cheques from the landlord to me with the exact amount of her and Bea's rent she put two and two together and interrogated me when I came home. I don't know why she opened my mail in the first place, I've never noticed her snooping before but maybe she has and I just never saw. Edit 2: ok answering a couple things I keep seeing in the comments. Yes I know the assets aren't technically mine but Inhave unlimited access to them, will inherit all of them one day(my parents have told me this directly it's not an assumption) and my parents consider it equally mine, so yes I consider them mine as well. I didn't earn them, I was just lucky enough to be born to amazing parents and I'm grateful to them for that. *generic comment about evil landlords: Bea and Sasha are NOT poor, and I'm not charging way above market price. If they felt the price was too steep they could dorm which is actually cheaper or find a cheaper place. They are paying extra for luxury, I'm not exploiting broke children. Why use cheques instead of ebanking: I do all of my business online but my dad bought a fancy custom mailbox and he's trying(and failing) to concince my mom that it wasn't a waste so he likes to mail EVERYTHING now. I get letters instead of texts. Yes it's ridiculous and after this incident we'll definitely be doing our finances online only. I maintain that I'm not mega rich. Yes, I acknowledge that I'm extremely privileged compared to most other Americans but in my head at least mega rich is people like my boyfriend's family that own actual mansions, and have yachts, or like celebrities and billionaires with private jets etc. Compared to most of my friends I'm middle class. Why I changed my last name when I'm on good terms with my father: My parents are both British Indian immigrants, and my dad has a super ethnic and long hard to pronounce last name whereas my mom has a nice short and cute last name. When I apply for jobs people will judge me based on my name and I don't want that. My dad faced that discrimination and I grew up in a predominantly white community so I know people's perception of you change based on how American/white you are perceived to be. Also my mom went through labour and 9 months of pregnancy, she deserves to have her last name continued. UPDATE: I can't believe it's actually been almost a month since I posted this, school is crazy. Anyways lots of yall were asking for an update; Sasha ended up moving out amicably and I waived this month's rent for her and Bea because I felt bad about lying to them. The comments are right, it was selfish, I was only thinking about how I wanted to avoid confrantation and awkwardness and I wasn't thinking about their feelings. Bea and I did aquire another roommate, who I was upfront with. I told her my parents own the house and they sent me the money back, and she was actually pretty chill about it. My dad transfers the money to me the normal way now(my mom chewed him out for the whole situation). I'm NOT pressing charges against Sasha, she doesn't need a felony on her record because she made one mistake, especially since I made one too. We still talk occasionally because we have some of the same classes, but I'm just glad the whole thing is over. Thanks to all the POLITE(some of yall have a lot of resentment you should work through) comments, your insight was invaluable. ",

        "selftext": "Throwaway because this is already enough of a mess. TW: miscarriage/stillbirth. I (26f) am planning my wedding to my fiance (27m) in a few months. Everything is going great and I love him so much. I can't wait to spend my life with him. He loves my family, and I, for the most part, love his. A bit of background, fiance has a much older brother. While my future MIL was pregnant three times in between them, all of them resulted in late miscarriages and stillbirths. As a result, MIL put all of her motherly love and attention on fiance. He had never tried a fruit or vegetable before I met him because his parents never made him when he was young and he had grown up assuming they were gross. (I got him to try some and he loves them now.) As we were planning our guest list, we consulted our families about which, and how many, relatives we should invite. Future MIL asked that we invite fiance's dead brother and sisters. When we asked what she meant, she wanted us to put up a framed photo of the dead babies in the pews at our wedding ceremony, and then save them seats at our reception. I was horrified. First of all, we are trying to have a fairly small wedding to start with, and a beautiful, intimate venue. We can only have seats for 30-50 people, and I would like these places to be for our friends and family, not people who have never met either of us because they are dead. Fiance agrees that three of 50 seats reserved for dead people is too many. He suggested we compromise and just let MIL put up all three photos in one seat.  Personally, I think it's gross and weird to include any of them. We're starting our lives together. We want to have a family and it almost seems like a bad omen, but it means a lot to her and it's a fairly small ask. Fiance's parents are paying for 75% of our wedding, and this is the only request she's had. So AITA for still refusing?",

        "selftext": " I (F) have been married to my husband Jeff for a year now. He has a daughter (12) with his deceased wife. When I first met Jeff it was obvious that he was struggling as a single parent. For my stepdaughter's birthday he'd usually get a cake from the bakery. This has been the case since her mom passed away. I thought I'd bake her a birthday cake for her 12th birthday that was last week as a gesture to show some motherly love and support. Jeff agreed and he told me what his daughter's favorite flavors are and what she likes and so on. I baked the cake in the flavor she likes and the icing she likes but one thing was missing and that is the blueberries and I couldn't include them because I went to the nearest store and they didn't have them. I was running out of time and couldn't get them so I ended up just leaving the cake as it thinking it wouldn't be a big deal. The party started and Jeff was busy taking care of everything else. He then came into the kitchen and asked to see the cake before bringing it out. I showed it to him and he got so angry when he saw that there were no blueberries on top. He went on and on about how I didn't fully commit to making the cake and that he trusted me to take care of it and just basically saying that he should've just ordered one from the bakery. We got into an argument and he ended up taking it and throwing it in the trashcan. I was stunned as he said you know what? Forget it, I'll get one from the bakery. I blew up and screamed at him, he told me to stop but I went upstairs, got dressed and left. He tried getting me to stay but I refused and went to my parents'. He later called and then texted about how I overreacted and hurt him and my stepdaughter by leaving. Also said that I created this situation by not properly making the birthday cake just cause I didn't put blueberries on top. I refused to respond but my parents say he was justified since he must've felt pressured from the stress of making his daughter happy on her birthday. He keeps trying to speak to me but I don't respond. AITA? did I overreact?",

Moments later he noticed it too, and I apologised, realising I must have started my period. My boyfriend freaked out and started shouting at me, asking why I'd ruined his favourite jeans.

I felt pretty upset and guilty, especially when I checked my period tracker and realised I was due to start today, and I should have been more wary that I was close to starting my period. Today he's apologised for shouting, but says he still upset about the jeans. He thinks I should have been more careful knowing that I was due to start my period today.

        "selftext": "My (42F) ex husband (45M) and I were together for 20 years. We had a beautiful daughter together, Joceline (14F). We got a divorce 5 years ago due to infidelity on his part. I was devastated. He was the love of my life and he betrayed all of the trust and loyalty we had built up. To make matters worse, he ended up in a relationship with the woman he cheated on me with. They got engaged one year later and are set to be married in two weeks. Honestly, I still am heartbroken over my divorce. It\u2019s hurtful to me that we were together for 20 years, and he could just go fall in love with someone else, as if I was nothing. However, Joceline was only 9 when we divorced, and he\u2019s a great father so I would never want to come in between their bond. Joceline loves his fianc\u00e9e as she\u2019s very sweet to her, but she doesn\u2019t know the reason why her dad and I divorced, I want to tell her when she\u2019s a bit older and he doesn\u2019t want to tell her at all. Anyways, I compromised with him that Joceline could come to the wedding, but that he would have to provide the transportation to and from the wedding, as I want no part of it. I don\u2019t want to drop my daughter off at his wedding, I don\u2019t want to see all the decorations and the happy guests, it\u2019d just be too much for me. I didn\u2019t tell him all of that obviously, but he agreed. Today he calls me and asks if he can ask for a huge favor. It turns out that his future in laws are flying in the morning of the wedding, and he has to go pick them up, therefore he can\u2019t pick up my daughter the day of and wanted to ask if I could take her. I said absolutely not and asked why he can\u2019t pick her up the day before when she gets off of school. He said he doesn\u2019t want to make the drive twice, and that he will likely not have time as he has to prepare for the rehearsal dinner. I asked why can\u2019t the bride pick up her parents, he said she\u2019ll be getting her hair done and won\u2019t be able to. I laughed and told him there was no way I\u2019d take my daughter, and that he\u2019d have to figure it out. Boy why did I say that. My daughter ran downstairs crying, face beet red 10 minutes after my conversation with her dad, calling me terrible and accusing me of not wanting her to spend time with her dad. I told her that\u2019s not the case and she demanded to know why I couldn\u2019t take her, I couldn\u2019t give her an answer and she ran upstairs crying. Now I\u2019m getting messages from his family calling me \u201cheartless\u201d and \u201ccold\u201d and a \u201cbitch\u201d for trying to \u201cruin his special day over a relationship that is long over\u201d. My family understands my point of view. But I feel terrible that I\u2019ve upset my daughter. I don\u2019t know what to do. AITA? Should I just put aside my feelings and take her?",

        "selftext": "Title is pretty self explanatory. But basically over the weekend, I had a work trip to go on so my sister offered to babysit my 2 year old. She\u2019s babysat him a few times so knows what to expect. Well, this time, she left her $3000 gaming laptop *on the floor* of her lounge room. She gave my son an open cup of apple juice without supervision, and he decided to use the laptop as a table on the floor. Things happen and somehow it got knocked over. Her laptop no longer switches on. She\u2019s blaming me and expects me to buy her a new one. I told her no as it shouldn\u2019t have been in his reach and certainly not on the floor. She\u2019s refusing to speak to me at the moment and said she\u2019ll never babysit for me ever again. I really don\u2019t feel as though it\u2019s my responsibility.. AITA? EDIT: Yikes this blew up. A few people have asked for more info. Yes, I packed both a straw cup and sippy cup in my sons bag. I supplied everything he\u2019d need for the weekend - including nappies and food. My parents were originally going to have him but my sister specifically asked if she could so she\u2019d be able to spend time with him. It wasn\u2019t just \u2018babysitting\u2019 but more enjoying time with her nephew. I gave her some money if she wanted to get takeout or for extra supplies and she was happy with that as \u2018payment\u2019 for watching my son. Every other time she\u2019d had him, the laptop has always been far out of reach.",

        "selftext": "I (F25) decided to become vegan at the beginning of this year, I watched Dominion and just sat there crying the whole time pretty much, so decided I can't knowingly pay for animals to be treated like that anymore. Since then I've been doing really well and I feel a lot better, I cook a lot of my own food, usually stews, curries, chilli, and various other meals. My friend and her 6 year old came round my house for a catch up. The child asked if they could have something to eat so I offered to make him a sandwich and listed off some of the options in my house, peanut butter, jam, yeast extract, etc. He asked for ham, I explained that I don't keep meat in the house as I don't eat it so I wouldn't be able to make him a ham sandwich. He then started asking me why I don't eat it, so I explained that to make ham they have to kill pigs and I don't agree with killing animals for food. He got really upset and started crying and asking his mum why she feeds him dead animals, and my friend got really annoyed at me for telling him where food comes from. They left pretty quickly and my friend texted me later on calling me all sorts of names and telling me I shouldn't push my extremist views on her child who now is refusing to eat meat.Maybe I should've just kept my mouth shut, but I feel like children have a right to know and understand what it is they're eating, and I only spoke about it because he was interested and asked me.  So AITA? I would just like to add some info that keeps coming up. All I said was exactly what was written in the post. I didn't go into graphic detail about what happens to animals. His mum was present for the entire conversation and made no input until he started crying. I would also like to add that some of you seem to think I was trying to convert this child to veganism. I'm not preachy and I don't tell people what to eat, I just answered a question honestly and maybe a little too quickly without thinking about who I was talking to.",

My niece (20F) is the only exception. She is my brother\u2018s (43M) daughter and despite her parents showing no prejudices against the LGBTQ+ community, she doesn\u2019t make a secret of her homophobia. I don\u2018t know where her believes stem from but the day I first introduced my husband/ then boyfriend to her family, she has been very hostile towards us (she was 14 at the time). She refuses to speak to my husband, barely acknowledges us at family gatherings and despite her father constantly chastising her, frequently uses the f-slur to refer to members of the LGBTQ+ community and calls same-sex relationships disgusting. Due to a severe flooding, my brother and his family have been forced to evacuate their house. My husband and I have a guest room and a sofa bed in our living room so when my brother asked we whether his family could stay at our place for a while, I told him that him, his wife and their younger children (15F, 12M) were very welcome to stay as long as they needed to, but that we weren\u2019t comfortable letting his oldest daughter stay with us.  He seemed to have been expecting that answer and told me that he understood my reasons. When he broke the news to his daughter, she was furious, asking where else she was going to stay and that she had nowhere else to go.From what I know, my brother offered to help her pay for a cheap hotel, but see doesn\u2019t want to dip into her savings because she doesn\u2019t work and she\u2018s been living with my brother rent free.  Apparently, she\u2018s been staying with a friend for a few days now and she\u2018s been telling her mother how awful it is there.

        "selftext": "I'm engaged to Noah and this was the first Christmas I spent with his family. I met them in the summer after we moved to be near his family now that he's finished with college. We're getting married in February and we're expecting our first child together in May. Being someone who has no family and seeing how close his family was, I wanted to make sure I showed my appreciation for them with the gifts I gave so I tried to get something each person would love. One of his sisters loves to read and so I made a book sleeve for her with little details from all her favorite books. One of his nieces is on the spectrum and has wanted clothes for her stuffy, so I made some clothes for her to put on the stuffy. I bought his mom a jewelry box that she had admired a couple of times after she mentioned never having a real one. For his dad I bought him a frame for his office big enough to hold photos of his whole family on, since he always complained he couldn't find one big enough or nice enough, and had no more room for individual frames. I included photos Noah had provided me in it. I got his other sister her favorite makeup which she mentioned she couldn't afford to buy lately. Then I got his brother a signed piece of memorabilia from his favorite sports team. For the rest of the nieces and nephews, I bought wish list items the parents weren't getting. Noah thought they would love everything. He told me I didn't need to go to the effort I did (I spent weeks tracking everything down and searching for certain items) but he really thought they'd like them. But when Christmas Day happened I could tell something was off. I spent the whole time worrying that I had bought them stuff they didn't like anymore or something. They said nothing. But then the next day they asked Noah what the hell I was thinking and I was like some kind of stalker buying them such personal stuff when I'm an almost stranger to them. The next day we saw them again and I apologized for the gifts I gave them and told them I would be a lot more mindful in the future. I offered to make it up to them. One of his sister's called me a stalker to my face and told me it was no wonder my family didn't want me if I was so creepy to do stuff like that. Noah yelled at her. I apologized again and told them I didn't want to hurt anyone and I would learn from this. They told me I had overstepped. Noah said we were leaving and they owed me an apology. I feel so bad. Noah is supporting me and told me I did nothing wrong. But surely there wouldn't be so much offense if that were true. I need to ask AITA? Also, not sure if this is relevant or not but I grew up in an unhappy home. My parents were unkind to me and my sister. She was much older and also hated me. I think maybe because of how our parents treated her. But I ended up with nobody who wanted me by the time I was 16 and I was homeless for a good period after that. That's what Noah's sister meant. I had told them honestly when they asked. ETA: I wanted to clarify something that might sound strange. I had spoken to them on the phone before but we had not met in person until this year. With Covid and us living in a different city at the time I had not gotten the chance. But they were genuinely all close before this. Sorry for another edit! I just wanted to clarify that we had met in person before Christmas, and more than once too, but I feel like I messed up expressing that here. I met them for the first time in the summer. Also, since people have been asking, they got me gift cards and they did not return the gifts. Just wanted to thank everyone for commenting. I am going to talk about what happened with my therapist and work on building up some more confidence in myself. I'm a work in progress. I have been in therapy for a while now but it's the first time I have been able to see a really good therapist. My history has left me with not very much belief in myself and my confidence has never been good. I never ever meant to make anyone awkward, uncomfortable or to make someone feel bad. I can see from a few comments that there are those who believe I was majorly wrong and should have known better. I didn't. It was my first Christmas with a family setting and my fiance is the only person I have shared Christmas with. But I know that what I did is not wanted by his family so I will accept that and work on being okay with that. I won't apologize again or be the try hard. Noah wants to talk to his family when he calms down but that might take a bit because he's angry and is ready to not see them again if they don't apologize. The kindness of so many people here made me cry and helped me to take some comfort in the fact I wasn't in the wrong for what I did. But I do appreciate the honesty also from people who would not like it and can see that for some it's just too much.",

        "selftext": "I wanna preface this by saying that I f34 married my husband m37 a year ago. His mom is snoopy and annoying af. She can't help it that is just how she is as my dear in laws say. My husband and I purchased a new house recently. My MIL kept pushing to get an emergency key, She promised that she only use it in an emergency but giving the fact that she had an emergency key to our old apartment and walked in on us being intimate twice (but my husband didn't think it was big deal) I just couldn't trust her so I just sent her a fake key (after she kept pushing) and she had a smug on her face after I hand delivered it to her. Days gone by and on Christmas dinner MIL angerily called me out on the fact I gave her a fake copy of the house key. She shamed me for doing this in front of everyone but in my defensive I asked her how she found out and she said days ago when she came over at 4 while my husband and were out. I reminded her didn't you promise you wouldn't use it unless there's an emergency? So You tried to get in when there was no emergency and you broke the promise you made to us! She looked red in the face and the other family started staring and some even laughed at her for the face she made. She suddenly got up from her seat and rushed into the kitchen where she had a huge meltdown so loud the next door neighbors must've heard - literally I've never heard a 60+ year old woman throw a tantrum like that. Needless to say dinner went awkward and my husband and his sister were giving me looks. My husband went off on me in the car and said I lied and manipulated and humiliated and exposed his mom and said he wouldn't have let me get away with it had he known. We had an argument and he is demanding I apologize to his mom for my childish behavior and for ruining Christmas dinner for the whole family. AITA? Eta so this went off unexpectedly and I thought I'd show my husband some pretty helpful comments I found here minutes ago but he got mad at me when he saw it and said I was nuts to talk about his family online. He demanded my phone so he could delete it but I refused and I went upstairs and into the bedroom. I never seen him so agitated and I didn't think he'd react like that honestly. But thank you guys for your support. It really means so much. I'll update if I can. Thanks again :)",

I am not comfortable with it at all especially with how hard she is pushing. She has multiple times overstepped boundaries such as inviting herself along, discussing very personal issues, very touchy etc\u2026.  Due to these issues we are not close and my own daughters are not a huge fan of her. She asked me this week if I would make the cookie table for the wedding. It is something the brides own mother would do with other female relatives. This is the first time hearing about this tradition and I did some research. I would have to make over a thousand cookies from scratch to feed the wedding guest. I asked my daughters if they wanted to do it and it was a strong no. I informed her that I can not do it, it is way to much work and I don\u2019t have the time. She told me okay and I thought that was it. My son called me up and told me I am a huge jerk. That Wendy has been crying about it and I should step up. I am still refusing to do it. AITA? Edit: common questions Did DIL tell me the number: Yes she stated 1000-1200 What about fmaily helping: she isn\u2019t close to her family so her side is out, my parents are in a home, I am an only child. My husband has a sister and I doubt she wants to help. Daughter don\u2019t wish to, so it would basically be me ",

        "selftext": "WIBTA for not attending my twin brothers surprise birthday dinner when I am only invited as a guest  Would I be the asshole for not attending a surprise birthday dinner for my twin brother  So I\u2019m a twin, my brother and I hang out all the time and we are super close. In a few days its our (25m) birthday. We share the same friend group and we\u2019re all really close and have been since school. He has a close group of girl friends (about 5 of them) who I have also known for many years, I would class them as being closer with him in recent years but we are all still good friends and socialise often together.  Now, I have been added to a group chat labeled \u201c*my brothers name* surprise dinner!\u201d It is a surprise birthday dinner for my twin brother organised by one of the girls in that group and they have invited me as a guest. One of them also said in the group that it would \u201cbe nice to see me as well\u201d so I just feel like an afterthought. I wouldn\u2019t really have minded if the girls wanted to organise a surprise birthday evening exclusively for my brother and themselves but they have also invited my partner and some of my brother and I\u2019s closest friends. This feels inconsiderate and quite upsetting as I can\u2019t understand why I would be invited to my literal twin brothers surprise birthday dinner with me only invited as a guest as it is also my birthday involving all of our friends. My girlfriend also found this action to be extremely rude and wondered why this girl didn\u2019t just reach out to her and then they could have organised a surprise involving both of us instead or have just involved both my brother and I and left the surprise element out of it.  In the chat it is clearly stated that we are all to arrive at one time while my brother is due to arrive 20 minutes later. The thought of attending makes me feel weird because it\u2019s just a celebration for \u201chis\u201d birthday when him and I are literally born on the same day. This isn\u2019t new information to the organiser. Also, every year my brother and I do something together because we want to and because we have the same friends, last year our friends and my girlfriend set up a massive dinner for our birthday to which everyone was invited, including the girl group.  So now I\u2019m at a crossroads. I don\u2019t know whether or not to attend. On one hand, if I don\u2019t go I will feel left out because our mutual friends are going. But on the other hand if I do go, I will feel like I am letting myself be disrespected and I will likely feel uncomfortable as it feels like only my brother is being celebrated. So, WIBTA if I took a stand and didn\u2019t go? EDIT: my girlfriend has just checked the chat and the organiser has booked the dinner for 10 people and a set menu. There are currently 11 attending excluding my girlfriend and I. If we went, this would make it way over capacity. Now we *really* aren\u2019t sure if we should go because what if we turn up and there is no room? This makes it slightly more awkward as we may not be able to just pull up a chair and join? The dinner is tomorrow also.  Thanks for all the kind messages as well, I will definitely give an update after everything plays out (Edit: I have posted an update to my profile as my character count was too long) [UPDATE](https://www.reddit.com/user/_somethingorrather/comments/1367ffb/update_wibta_for_not_attending_my_twin_brothers/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1)",

The issue is they always want to split the check. I have had the conversation so many times that I want to pay for what I ordered. It results in an argument where I have to bend or everyone is mad at me. I also make a lot more then my friends so it always result in them basically calling me cheap. They don\u2019t get I want to pay for my meal and that is it.  Anyways we went out to eat yesterday and they all ordered things that were around 30 dollars, I got the house salad and my total was around 12. They told the server to split the bill and I didn\u2019t want to fight about it again. I asked the server to add on to the bill an entree and dessert for me to take home. This resulted in my bill going up into the 30s. So they asks me what I was doing, I told them I am getting more food, they got upset they I increased the price they needed to pay. This resulted in another argument and they think I am a jerk. Edit: Reddit I\u2019ve done everything you have suggested, I have had the server take mine out and I pay for it, I have spoken to them. If I do anything that isn\u2019t splitting the bill with them they get pissed",

        "selftext": "My friend [25F] is constantly late for everything. Be it work-related or fun activities, she will always be at least 15-20 minute late. She does not have a car, and so oftentimes I [25M] will pick her up from her house (I work at a university and she is a PhD student there, and her place is along the way for me).  Last time I offered her a ride to work, she ended up being 20 minutes late after I've already arrived at her place. Because of that, I ended up being late for work. She is always very apologetic about her lateness, but never changes. This week she was supposed to give a seminar at the university which is a crucial part of her PhD program. She asked me if I could give her a ride to work that day. I told her sure, but that I was picking her up at 8 AM and she must be there exactly at 8 AM, and not a minute later. She chuckled, but I told her I wasn't joking, and she promised that she will be there.  The morning of her seminar, I drove to her place and got there at 7:55, and texted her that I was here, and she told me should would be out in just a minute. At 8:00, there was no indication that she would come out (and she didn't text anything), so at 8:01, I drove off.  At around 8:20, she called me asking me where I was. I told her I was at work and that I wasn't joking when I told her that she had to be ready right that minute. She started screaming and crying over the phone, and told me that she was having a hard time that morning couldn't be ready right at 8 AM. She then begged me to come back to pick up her, as her seminar is at 9 AM and she needed to be at the school before then. I could've done it quick enough to pick her up and drop her off without affecting my work, but I decided I didn't want to do that, and told her that I won't.  She was crying and hyperventilating at that point and said she'd promise to never be late for anything else again, and reemphasized that this seminar was crucial for her PhD and that she absolutely cannot miss it without severe consequence. I responded oh well, and hung up. I then went about my day at work normally.  I feel like could've went back and picked her up in this scenario since it wouldn't have been detrimental to me and at the same time this was something very important for her. On the other hand, I feel like this should be a wake-up call for her chronic lateness. EDIT: thank you everyone for the kind words. To answer a few common questions:Yes, she did miss her seminar and apparently got into big trouble with the school. I don't think it's going to ruin her PhD, but there definitely are consequences. Regarding our friendship, it was already on its way out when this happened, and now we haven't talked at all for a while.",

        "selftext": "My (54M) daughter (19F) is living with me this summer before heading to college later this month. She spent the majority of her middle and high school years at her moms due to divorce custody arrangements. My daughter had knee surgery at the end of July to fix a torn ACL. As a result, I\u2019ve been with her a lot helping her recover (food, icing, transportation, etc).  Last week, I noticed in the hallway bathroom that she uses, that there were tampon \u201ccovers/wraps \u201d (I don\u2019t know the official name). The next time I checked on her I asked her to confirm that she was throwing her tampons away and not flushing them.She said No, they get flushed down the toilet. She said I should be kind of embarrassed that I have a 19yo daughter and don\u2019t even realize that.I told her No they don\u2019t. I reminded her of all the doctor office and hospital bathrooms where reminder notes are left asking women not to flush their feminine hygiene products. At the same time as I said that, she finished looking on her phone and I could tell she found information on-line that confirmed the garbage is the correct disposal method. I asked her to please use the garbage from now on. Later that night, I sent her two different Internet searches, confirming not to put tampons down the toilet, and instead to put them in the garbage.  Several days later, when I was checking on her, I asked her if she was using the garbage for her tampons. She said No. I reminded her what we talked about and what I had asked her to do. She said I didn\u2019t understand, since I was a man.I told her, yes, I am a man and yes, I don\u2019t understand. However, millions of American women have figured it out.  I asked her if she had googled how to dispose of bloody tampons?She said I\u2019m not going to Google that.I asked her if she had thought about using plastic bags to wrap her tampons in, or using something like that.She said again that I wouldn\u2019t understand what it\u2019s like to dispose of a bloody tampon. I agreed with her again. I said it sounds like you are not willing to try or learn something new in order to do it differently. I told her if that was the case then she could pay the plumber bill if I ever needed to call the plumber to come fix a clogged drain line due to a tampon. She basically gave up and said Fine.As I was leaving she said that I was being \u201cjust like mom\u201d.  AITA? PS - I know how this sub works, so expecting some questions. I\u2019m driving for the next four hours and won\u2019t be able to reply until much later. Judge away! Edit 1 - stopped at Pilot rest stop. Going to respond to just a few questions In the USA There is a garbage can in bathroom. Directly underneath the toilet paper (both in arms reach of the toilet) No lid on trash can. Thanks for suggesting. Edit 2 - when my daughter says I\u2019m just like her mother, I think that is meant to be a \u201cyou\u2019ve said the rule and regardless of what I say you aren\u2019t going to change your mind.  You won\u2019t listen to me and change your view\u201d Also, I think her issue with me is that I couldn\u2019t understand what it\u2019s like to deal with the bloody tampon since I\u2019m a man. Edit 3 - Thanks for all the input!I'll ask my daughter about a covered garbage can in the bathroom as well as gloves and/or small plastic bags.No dogs in the house.",

        "selftext": "My 10 year old daughter wanted bangs for a long time because a friend of her's recently had her hair cut and had bangs cut and it ended up being very cute. My daughter has beautiful hair, it's very long, but it's thin. I had my cousin, who is a hairdresser who actually has an area of focus on kids haircuts, consult and she said that if we cut bangs into my daughter's hair it wouldn't look right due to how thin her hair is. I normally let my daughter have a say in the choices she makes regarding clothes and hair but on this one I put my foot down because I know it won't look good and she is going to wind up unhappy. My cousin also uploaded a photo of my daughter to FaceApp and showed me what she would look like with bangs and it just wasn't a good look (I know FaceApp isn't 100% accurate but it was pretty close in this regard). Day before yesterday my daughter told me she was going to take some alone time in our bathroom. It was only after she'd been in the bathroom a while that I noticed the scissors I keep in the kitchen were missing. These are big meat scissors. And then I heard her in the bathroom crying so I made her open the door and she was hunkered with her back to me, sobbing, and I saw a hunk of hair in the sink. She had watched a TikTok compilation of people cutting their hair and tried to do bangs! It was not good results. The hair doesn't lay flat, she cut very unevenly, and she cut too short (using your index finger place the tip in the center part and go down to the first bend and that's how short she cut). I really didn't know what to say so I made sure hadn't hurt herself with the scissors, which she didn't. I looked at her hair, realized I wasn't going to be able to even it up myself, so I called my cousin, who came over and made the cut even but it required cutting shorter, and now her hair is fucked up. My daughter is mortified and doesn't want to go into public now. She keeps begging me to fix it even though I've explained to her, and my cousin explained it can't be fixed. So I told her, this is what happens when you don't listen. You made the mistake yourself. You hid in the bathroom because you knew it was wrong. You have to live with the consequences and wait for it to grow. My husband says I'm being very cold and unsympathetic and that our daughter is 10, she didn't know any better, she was just learning and doing what kids do. I feel that she knew exactly what she was doing and that it was wrong, hence her hiding from me. My husband said that if I had just taken her to the salon and had her hair cut then she wouldn't have done it herself. My daughter hates the bangs, says my cousin was right that it wouldn't look good so if I had taken her to get it done then she'd be blaming me. We're at a stalemate. AITA? EDIT: why is everyone focusing on me when she asked my husband for bangs as well and he said no? He told her he didn't think it would look good. He could have also easily taken her to the salon.",

        "selftext": "AITA? Hello. So to give some context, I f35 have been married to my husband, m37 for 6 months. He has 2 children from two different (uninvolved) mothers and they live with us full time. The kids are 7y.o. And 10y.o. I work long hours and it's a demanding job time wise. My husband thinks that just because I wfh that I can pause whenever but it's untrue. He'd ask me to do things for the kids or him during work hours, but I told him I'm working and unavailable during those hours, and that the kids are his responsibilty til I'm done. Yesterday, He told me he wanted to go attend a friend's engagement dinner and asked if I could take time off work to make the kids dinner. I told him absolutely not, and insisted that he cook for them or order takeout. He said he had no time to cook, and takeout was off the table since he doesn't want them to eat fast food. He later said fine and that he was going to cook dinner then go to the party. 2hrs later, the kids came in and said they were hungry. I was puzzled, I asked if their dad cooked them dinner and they said he didn't. Moreover!!! He told them to come ask me to cook for them at exactly 7pm. I was so pissed to find myself in this situation. I took few minutes off the meeting and ordered takeout from the nearby restaurant and fed the kids, then had them watch tv then go to sleep. He came home at 11PM and went off on me after he discovered that I didn't cook like he was counting on me to do. Not only that, but he yelled about feeding the kids takeout. I argued back saying I had no choice after he basically tricked me into cooking for them knowing I was busy, so I ordered food and made sure the kids were fed while I focused on work. He ranted about how I care more about work than my stepchildren (God forbid) and called me selfish then went upstairs and refused to talk to me. He's still sulking about it today and says I need to get my priorities in order cause they're messed up. Info - About that friend's engagement. My husband has this friend from college. They're close and he couldn't miss the event. Moreover, he said he was upset with me for missing the event and now refusing to cook a homemade healthy meal and ordering takeout knowing it's a no go for him. Info - The reason I expected him to cook other than the fact that I was busy, was that he usually cooks for them so it's both of our responsibility. Info - Does he work? Yes, but barely. He works at a warehouse only twice a week. His friend's dad owns the warehouse and do he has a lot of leverage. Info - More context on the mothers. One is an ex wife, the other is an ex girlfriend. Both left for financial reasons he said but I'm not fully convinced by that.",

        "selftext": " My husband (m33)s best friend (m37) Will is infertile. He got divorced 2 times because of it and because he lied and hid his infertility. And his life hasn't been the same the day he was told he can't have kids. He has always had a soft spot for children and when he found out that my husband and I are expecting, he was so thrilled and started buying us gifts and decore pieces that he made from his woodwork for the baby. My husband thinks that those are all nice gestures but I couldn't help but feel uncomfortable especially with how much he keeps mentioing the baby. A few days ago, my husband and I found the gender of the baby. The minute we told Will, he started calling the baby a random name he picked and was going to give to his baby if he wasn't infertile. He then started begging us to use this name and my husband said it was a done deal. I refused but my husband called me heartless and asked me to do this one small, nice gesture for his struggling friend to give him closure and honor him after all the things he has done for us. I flipped and said it's my baby not his. Will heard this and left immediately. My husband yelled at me saying it's his baby too and my behavior towards Will was abhorant. He left after him and didn't come back til the morning. He kept saying the same thing and pressuring me to agree on the name but I refused. AITA for choosing this hill to die on?",

        "selftext": "I (24f) have been dating \u201cBen\u201d (26M) for eight months. For context, Ben and I are from different income brackets, and Ben has expressed that he sometimes feels a little bit weird about this because he is a gentleman at heart but he says it\u2019s hard to treat me since I\u2019m not really impressed by his gestures. I\u2019ve said many times that I\u2019m not concerned about these kind of things either way, but it comes up periodically. Last night Ben and I went to dinner with 6 of my friends. There were 3 men in total and 5 women. At the end of the dinner the two guys \u201cMax\u201d and \u201cHarry\u201d said they would get the bill, as the guys usually do when we\u2019re out. Ben quietly said to me that he wasn\u2019t really comfortable with the guys paying for his dinner so I said I\u2019d chip in with the bill. Ben said thank you but could he chip in and then I could pay him back afterwards because he didn\u2019t want them to know I was paying.  This struck me as totally absurd because firstly, it\u2019s an unnecessary step, second even split the cost was something I wasn\u2019t sure he would realistically be able to cover, and third I felt like he was trying to enter a pissing contest with my friends which was just childish.  I said no I would just pay and then turned to everyone and said I\u2019d chip in a third of the bill. No one batted an eyelid, but Ben was sulking.  He\u2019s now mad at me saying I emasculated him and made him look bad in front of my friends. I think he\u2019s overdramatising it because my friends couldn\u2019t care less and he needs to get over himself.  Am I in the wrong for not letting him \u201csave face\u201d?",

        "selftext": "I (25F) am getting married May of next year. I\u2019m currently planning the reception and I have already secured a venue. I was having a discussion with my fianc\u00e9 (27F) about possible food options (catering or cooking, what types of food, buffet style or served, etc.) and my mother (60F) and one of my aunts (56F) were visiting. They threw in some thoughts and advice, as they\u2019ve had weddings, which I really appreciate. The topic of drinking came up, and my aunt asked what kind of cocktails we\u2019d be serving. I told her we wouldn\u2019t be serving alcohol at the wedding. She was shocked and asked what everyone was going to drink. I told her there would be water, sweet tea, lemonade, fruit-punch, and soda available. My aunt said that having soda was a bad idea because it\u2019s so unhealthy, and so is sweet tea and overly sugary lemonade and fruit-punch. I told her if was so concerned about sugar content she could stick with water, and we\u2019re planning on having plenty of fresh fruit she could add to it. We\u2019d also have unsweet tea for my diabetic family members, or they\u2019re welcome to request or bring a desirable alternative. She asked why alcohol couldn\u2019t be a request. I told her I simply didn\u2019t want to serve any at my wedding. My fianc\u00e9 and I would be financially responsible for the purchase (and alcohol would frankly be out of our budget) and we would feel responsible for their actions. She asked if she and the other drinkers of the family could bring their own beer and said it really wouldn\u2019t be a party without one. I said no, again, because it\u2019s my wedding and fianc\u00e9 and I would feel responsible for drunk guests. We also want to have a wedding that\u2019s fun and happy because everyone there loves each other and is happy to celebrate their family/our union. She said it was already a shame I wasn\u2019t getting married in a church and the least I could do was make up for it with a good reception. I told her if she can\u2019t go one evening without drinking then maybe she\u2019s the one with a problem. At this point my mom jumped in and told me I need to apologize, I said no, I don\u2019t appreciate how my aunt has spoken to me and she needs to leave. They ended up going, but then my aunt complained the next day on Facebook about my \u201cdry wedding\u201d and said she wasn\u2019t going to torture herself driving an hour and a half to my venue just to have a bad time. She also explained how the conversation went the day before and said I called her a drunk for being healthy. I\u2019ve been getting a lot of messages, some supportive, some on the fence, and some very angry that I want to \u201cruin a good reception by acting like it\u2019s the prohibition era\u201d. I\u2019m honestly confused here, am I the asshole? Edit: my aunt\u2019s health comment wasn\u2019t about beer, it was about wine. She believes a glass a day is important for maintaining health and she drinks at least one glass every single day. She\u2019s also hopped on the intermittent fasting trend, so I take her \u201chealth advice\u201d with a grain of salt. Especially since she probably meets the medical threshold for alcoholism.  Also, another reason I don\u2019t want alcohol is because this is a specifically kid friendly event. I want my little cousins and nieces/nephews and my fianc\u00e9\u2019s younger family members to be able to attend. I don\u2019t feel comfortable hosting an all-ages event with lots of alcohol and drunk adults present. A lot of my family members do not behave when they\u2019re drunk. EDIT 2: For those saying I should make the \u201cdry\u201d part clear in advance, I planned on having the entire food and drink situation for the wedding figured out and announced six months before the date. I wasn\u2019t going to spring it on people last minute. Everyone was going to be informed and then further reminded on the Save-The-Date\u2019s and the invites! I\u2019m also not anti-alcohol or something. I like drinking, there are just too many concerning factors and liabilities with allowing it at my wedding, including the incredibly expensive cost of providing the alcohol. Edit 3: To everyone suggesting a cash bar, that would invariably make this situation worse. My relatives expect me to provide alcohol for free. If I tell them they have to pay they will complain more. One of my uncles was arrested last year because the price of his favorite brand of beer went up and he stole his next 12-pack because \u201che deserved it after how much money he gave to that company\u201d. He still thinks the cops and the store were in the wrong. Edit 4: Very tired of people not reading or simply ignoring what I\u2019ve already made clear and twisting my words. I\u2019ve explained my case. Most of you agree with me. I am done responding to comments and explaining/answering questions.",

        "selftext": "I\u2019m the dad of a 25 year old young woman who I love very much. I\u2019ve been able to have a good relationship with my daughter and I enjoy my time with her, but there\u2019s one thing about her that would give many people pause - she is a diagnosed sociopath. She exhibited odd, disturbing behavior at a young age, and after a serious incident of abuse towards her younger sister, I realized she needed professional help. Throughout her elementary years she struggled heavily, getting in lots of trouble in school for lying, cruelty and all other types of misbehaviors. With an enormous amount of therapy & support, her bad behavior was minimized as she grew older. She received an ASPD diagnosis at 18, and I had suspected it for long prior. After her aggressive behavior was tamed, her following years were much more fruitful. She\u2019s law-abiding; has a decent job and a good education; and has many good friendships and admirers. Especially male admirers; she is very, very charming and adept at attracting guys and maintaining their interest. She uses that old dating guide \u201cThe Rules\u201d like a Bible. She currently has a boyfriend of about a year and a half who\u2019s crazy about her, and who I have a very strong relationship with (we live in the same area and spend time together regularly). He is a **great** guy, very kind, funny and intelligent. But I doubt she loves him. We\u2019ve had some very honest, in-depth discussions about her mental health since her diagnosis, and she\u2019s been open with me that she doesn\u2019t feel love or empathy towards anyone, even family. When she acted very sad and broken up over the death of one of her closest friends at the funeral, she confessed to me privately that it was all a put-on, and that she felt \u201cpretty neutral\u201d about the whole thing. She has also stated she has never once felt guilty about anything she\u2019s ever done, and doesn\u2019t know what guilt feels like. While she enjoys being around her boyfriend and is sexually attracted to him, I highly doubt she feels much of anything towards him love-wise. Her boyfriend (who might propose soon) **has** **no idea** about her diagnosis, and she\u2019s been very upfront with me that she has no plans to ever tell him, thinking it\u2019ll scare him away. I\u2019ve made it clear to her that she needs to tell him the truth before they marry; that he has the right to know and consider it; **or I will**; to which she always responds, \u201cI know you wouldn\u2019t dare.\u201d I actually would - I really like and respect this young man, and would feel awful keeping this \u201csecret\u201d from him, and letting him walk into a marriage without this piece of knowledge. I\u2019m not trying to sabotage my daughter\u2019s future. **Maybe** her boyfriend\u2019s love of her personality and other aspects is enough that it won\u2019t end the relationship. It\u2019s his decision to make; but he deserves all the facts. Someday he\u2019s bound to find out she\u2019s a bit \u201coff\u201d; it can\u2019t be kept a secret forever. AITA?",

Their father left after Cassie was born, no family nearby, etc. I have 2 sitters that I can call on as needed and I use them before I\u2019d ever ask Polly for help. I don\u2019t want her missing out on her teenage years. Before this incident, I only ever asked her to babysit once because I had no one else and I paid her $15/hr (at the time, above minimum wage).  This past Saturday, Polly was due to hang out with some friends. For a couple of days, Trevor was ill, but testing negative for Covid. That day, he spiked a very high fever and I had to take him to the ER. I asked Polly to watch Cassie as the sitters weren\u2019t responding. I apologized that she\u2019d have to miss out on time with friends but said I\u2019d pay her and she could even have her friends over our place. Polly pitched a fit and asked why I couldn\u2019t send Cassie to the neighbors. We don\u2019t know them. They moved in last month and outside waving when we get our mail, I don\u2019t have a relationship with them.  Polly was irritated. I told her I\u2019d pay her $18/hr and that I had to go.  I take Trevor to the ER and we have to wait a bit. Polly kept asking if the sitters responded and they hadn\u2019t. Eventually it was our time to be seen, so I told Polly i\u2019d be out of reach for a bit. Turns out, Trevor had a bad case of RSV and due to pre-existing health problems, had to be admitted for the night. I was terrified. When I called Polly to update her, I heard people talking in the background and said \u201coh, you had your friends come over?\u201d She told me no, she dropped Cassie at the neighbor\u2019s and went out. I was furious. I told her to go home and get her sister. I then asked for the neighbor\u2019s number, she didn\u2019t even ask for it. Which, I get teenage logic but still. At first Polly refused until I told her she was grounded. I made her FaceTime me when she got home to show that Cassie was with her. Eventually, my mom was able to make the 2 hour drive down to stay with the girls but I told her to not let Polly leave the house. The next day, Trevor and I were able to go home. I lectured Polly about what she did and grounded her for 2 weeks. She got mad at me and said that I can\u2019t expect her to drop her plans. I point out I never do, but this was an emergency and her brother was sick. She told me that\u2019s not her problem. She\u2019s also mad because I won\u2019t pay her. I apologized profusely to the neighbor who said it was okay and that he would\u2019ve called me but Polly didn\u2019t leave my number either. Polly said I overreacted. AITA?",

        "selftext": "I have a wife (Wilhelma, 40) and two sons (Sam, 17, and Scott, 16).  6 years ago, I ran to the gas station to buy some cigarettes.  Instead of abandoning my family (just a joke) I decided to also buy a lottery ticket for everyone, just for fun.  It was a blast.  We all talked all night about what we would do with our winnings, where we would go, etc.  I mean, this was all fantasy anyway, right?  But I specifically told my kids that they would have to share their winnings, and they would have to put it away for college first and foremost.  Well wouldn't you know it, Sams ticket won.  Of course its actually MY ticket, and I had to claim it.  It didn't win the jackpot, but after taxes we walked away with $60k.  I sat them both down and explained that I was going to save it all for college, but we could celebrate/splurge a little.  They absolutely wanted a gaming system, and Wilhelma insisted on a family vacation that was much needed.  We all agreed on this, and saving the rest.  I bought the gaming system and a bunch of games for about $1k.  Wilhelma took over the vacation and insisted on a Disney World trip.  The boys don't even like Disney, but it was always Wilhelma's dream to go so we went.  Another $5k.  Last year, Sam wanted a car.  Wilhelma was pretty tired of chauffeuring them around anyway, so I agreed and spent his $4k on a car.  I pay the insurance, registration, and maintenance under the agreement that he takes over driving Scott to his stuff as well.  Wilhelma had no complaints about any of these purchases.    Since day 1, I've actually invested the entire winnings and never dipped into it.  I've always spent my OWN money on all this stuff.  I have invested better than average, and that $60k is now $100k.  Wilhelma knows I have always invested our money, but it was always small amounts since we're poor.  She knows I was investing the lottery winnings as well.  I've always told her about the money doing well, but I guess I never explicitly said how well.  She also has never asked, as she has left our finances completely up to me.    Sam is starting college in a few weeks, and we figured out a plan to stretch his $30k over the 4 years.  While looking at the portfolio, Wilhelma noticed it was at $100k and asked how.  I told her I invested the $60k and grew it to $100k.  She then asked why we're only giving Sam $30K when it should be $50k.  I said no, the other $40k is mine.  I managed this account, I made the investments, I did all of the work.  Plus I paid for all that other stuff through our other savings. The $40k stays and I'll keep investing it.  If the boys NEED the money, its there, but if not I'm gonna eventually retire a little early with it.  She thinks I'm stealing his money since I wouldn't have been able to invest with it if I didn't have it to begin with.  I say its always kinda been my money, and I'm still giving him the $30k I promised him since the beginning.",

        "selftext": "My daughter (16F) has been vegan for about a year. Me, my husband and her brother (14M) have tried to be as supportive as possible.  We aren't a family that eats meat daily, so it wasn't that hard for me to accommodate her. When I do cook meat, I also make something else for her and keep the side dishes common for all. She does have some seperate dishes, but most are common and I clean it if I have to cook for her.  Few months into the vegan lifestyle, she tried to convince us to go vegan and would get increasingly angry when we said no. Me and husband shut that behaviour down hard and told her that she can follow whatever diet she wanted, but she cannot expect others to. She sulked for a while, but stopped doing that.  Last weekend, I cooked the family a big pot of chilli (a small vegan one and a large beef one), so that I can refrigerate it and use for the next week. Next day, I found the fridge empty of both the chilli and turns out, my daughter decided that we were are being too callous about meat. She felt the smell was too much when she opened the fridge door and that she can't anything from the fridge after that without gagging or puking. She told me that I need to throw out all the vegan food in the fridge and restock them.  Me and my husband were livid. Wasting food is never okay with us and that was a lot of food. I told her I am going to continue using the vegan products in the fridge and she can either eat it or not, but I am not wasting food. That whole week she kept making faces at dinner while she ate.  As a punishment, I gave her the recipe and told her she needs to buy them and cook it next weekend. She yelled and begged, but I stood firm. In the end, she did it.  When the cooking was finished, I told her that wasting food is never okay in this house and pointed out that instead of x amount of meat being used, 2x amount of meat (Since this seems to be confusing. I meant as in x amount in the pot she wasted + x amount in the new one. I didn't purposefully make her put more than what was used previously) was used because she threw the food away.  Now, she started crying and yelling at me about how awful and disgusting I was because I not only forced her buy meat (which she is very much against), I also forced her to cook it and now I am also telling her that it was her fault.  She is really upset about this. So, I am wondering if I went too far. Should I have picked a different punishment? My husband and brother definitely think what I did was right while my parents thinks I was in the wrong.  I thought I will put it to a vote. AITA?",

When my son proposed, we talked to both he and his fiancee to find out their game plans for the future. We wanted to buy them a house but one question decided *how big*: do they plan on having children? Their answer was yes, so we did buy them a house, but kept it in our name. Because they were common-law at this point and not yet married, we worried what if they broke their engagement: if the house was in my son's name for example, she would be entitled to some of it. At least in our names, our family is protected. We think the world of his fiancee, this was just a devil's advocate, worst case scenario thing. They've been engaged for two years and the wedding is coming up this October. But we were hit by a bombshell a couple of weeks ago that they no longer have any desire to have children. This is fine: we don't expect or assume anything, if they don't have kids, it's their life, we don't respect them any less for it. But it made my husband a little tiffed that we specifically bought them a big house under that assumption. We would have bought them a smaller 2+1 bedroom or thereabouts if they planned on being childfree. But instead we were told children are in their future so we bought them a 5 bedroom home. This is like the difference of a factor of two. We spent our money needlessly. I'm pushing my husband to sell the house because it's in our name still. My husband says it will create a rift between families but this whole thing was based on misinformation. I don't think they did it with malice hehe we get a bigger house if we lie, but I think they knew they didn't want children. You don't be in a relationship for 8 years and don't have that conversation, right? Would I be the asshole for selling their home? We'd get them a smaller one, of course, we just don't think they'll need anything bigger. They'd never be homeless. **EDIT** Just so it's clear, we don't mind or care if they have children or not. The problem is they have a larger house we bought specifically for a family. Children need extra space. Now that it's out of the question, they can make due with a smaller house. Our other son is married to a wonderful man and we bought him a house, too. Same kind of scenario as this, they got a 2+1 bedroom house. In our names until they got married, then transferred to their name once married. This is how we're giving our two children wedding gifts. There's already been hubbub between my children why does x get a 5 bedroom home when we only got a 2 bedroom, etc. Because they're having children can't be our reasoning anymore.",

He can be quite rude and make backhanded comments about me and the family sometimes which is bothersome but my sister says he's not malicious but is just the brutally honest time and we should get used to it. I visited my parents house to celebrate my sister's birthday and my husband couldn't come with me because he was busy, after the party we all sat down for dinner and my sister's boyfriend said it was weird that my husband and I don't have kids despite being married for 6 years now, I was shocked that he brought this up but I gave a short answer stating that it's because of infertility issues, he asked on which side and I didn't wanna answer but my sister said it's on my side. I got uncomfortable as he looked at me for a second and said that maybe not having kids now is a good thing because he thought women over 30 might produce defective babies due to age. I told him it was none of his business but he said that he was just giving his honest opinion and that's all. I, in return, told him while maintaining eye contact: trust me, if I wanted an asshole's opinion, I would've farted!. Literally everyone at the table bursted into laughter and my sister and her boyfriend were stunned. Few seconds later her boyfriend excused himself out and my sister followed then sent me a text after they left saying I was mean and disrespectful towards her boyfriend and insulted him maliciously just cause he stated his honest opinion, she also said I ruined her birthday by being petty and making her boyfriend the joke of the night infront of the family. I didn't respond but she demanded an apology via mail as soon as possible, mom agreed that I shouldn't have said what I said and should've just ignored him knowing how he is. I think AITA but I'm not sure.",

        "selftext": " I f31 have been with my boyfriend m37 for 8 months. He has 3 kids and is a single dad. We're on pretty good terms regarding almost everything. When it comes to money and spending, we'd take turns to invite each other out weekly (we don't live together obviously). Several times he had me pay for his kids purchases. I didn't make a big issue out of it for the sole reason that those purchases were relatively small, all I had to pay was $30-60. The other day, he called me while I was at work and sounded like he was in a hurry. He said he just found the gaming device he's been looking for for so long and wanted to buy it for his oldest son. I asked what's this have to do with me, and he told me he was short on money and needed $300. He asked me to lend him the $300 and I hesitated but agreed. He asked for my bank account info so he could pull the money but I refused and told him to wait for me til I get there. He insisted and said he'd handle it, all I had to do was just send him my bank account info after I end the call with him. His insistence made me uncomfortable so I still said no and told him to either wait or I won't pay. He got mad at me saying he didn't get why I was acting like this. He got so loud I had to hung up. I found him sitting outside after I went home. He was waiting for me and was extremely upset. He asked why I didn't just send him the account info so he could pull the money we agreed on. I told him I don't feel comfortable letting anyone have my personal info especially when it comes to finances . He got offended and said I'M NOT JUST ANYONE, I'M YOUR F'ING PARTNER!! Then went on a rant about how he ended up not paying the gaming device after looking for it for so long and now his kid is mad at him and it's my fault. We had a fight then he left and told me I'd better have an apology for him AND his son next time I call his phone. .....I haven't call yet but I feel like I acted stupidly and irrationally. I think I should've just given him the info he asked for?.,,I don't know if I made the right decision. **UPDATE:** Wow so, I've left this thread after the first hour but got back to hundreds of people engaging...Wow I'm just amazed. And since many of you wanted to know what happened, I've went to his place and talked to him and his oldest son, turns out that the gaming device thing was a lie. He wanted the money for something else, to help pay for one of his buddies car repair. I was shocked when he confessed and said he had to lie and make it about his kids to get me to lend him the money. You can only imagine my reaction after this, I just blew up at him and left without giving him any chance to respond. He tried calling my phone (still trying) but I decided I want some space to think about what happened and really re-evaluate our relationship. It's true that he had me pay for the kids in the past but after what I found I wouldn't put it past him that those $30-60 purchases weren't for the kids as I haven't seen the stuff he said he bought for them. I'm in need of some space and quiet though I'm busy with work but I do my best to stay focused. I, quite frankly am no longer sure if I could move past this....it's just so unsettling that he has no issue lying to me and USING me for money like that. I love the kids, I ADORE thrm but him? He's hurt me with what I did and I'm not sure I could come back from it. I might just be upset right now and will need time...I don't know....yeah...I'm just going to do a lot of thinking regarding this situation and see what happens. Sorry for the long text but I wanted to let you know about the situation  as a whole.",

My kids don't get along super well, Dax thinks pranksare really funny, I guess like every 12 year old boy, and he annoys Mia with them a lot. It's something my husband and I have been working on as it's the source of many fights between them.  Dax gets a lot of prank ideas from YouTube and TikTok and will often recreate what he sees. Most of them are harmless (something like a fake spider in her food etc.), but this time I think he went too far. Dax thought it would be funny to put Saran Wrap over the toilet before my daughter went to the bathroom. He says he got the idea from online? Idk if this is a thing but it's a terrible prank. Basically he put plastic wrap under the toilet seat so if someone sits on it, well pretty much it makes a mess instead of going in the bowl. Yeah I know, ew.  So he does this right before Mia goes in the bathroom to pee. When she gets in there she sits on the seat like normal, pees, and since there's plastic wrap over the hole, her pee collects on it and gets everywhere, all around the ground on the toilet and on her.  She comes to me crying. She's embarrassed because she's a teenage girl and this is... disgusting. I told Mia to shower and not worry about the mess.  Here's where I might be TA... I go to my Son and yell at him for what he did. I tell him that's not an appropriate prank and he's old enough to know that's not okay. And then I made him clean in up.  He started crying saying it's unfair I make him clean his sisters pee. It's gross and he's going to be sick. He says it's from her body so she should clean it. But it was all his fault and literally his mess to deal with, I don't know why I should humiliate my daughter further or why I should have to clean it. And biggest thing, he needs to learn.  I told him the mess was his fault and he should think about the repercussions of his actions next time, because this is what his prank caused. And then I stood in the doorway and watched as I made him clean all of the urine off the floor and toilet.  I think it was an appropriate punishment considering it's really just the natural consequence of what he did, and it doubles as a general lesson in how to clean a toilet which he has to learn at some point anyway.  Well my husband disagrees. This all happened while he was at work, and after he got home Dax complained to him.  He told me I was overly harsh on our son and put him in danger by exposing him to germs. But I gave him the same gloves I use when I have to wash the toilet and it's not like he was unsupervised.  But my husband is mad at me and told me I want too far and that's bad parenting. Of course my son is mad at me too. But my daughter is on my side.  AITA? Am I a bad Mom?",

This acc is just for privacy reasons -I always had good grades in high-school, was home on time, cleaned the house etc. I never had problems with my parents before this.  -I went to med school, still living with parents when I was 20, I dated someone who was 23 -Dad was against this because be does not believe in dating people far older than you (so like don't date far from your own age)  and says I cannot date J.  -Argument breaks out, Dad says it's his house so either I agree or I move out. I say it's not fair as J has a job, goes to college, has future plans etc. Dad kicks me out. Mom agrees with his decision. Little bro was only 14 at the time.  -I moved with J, his family was supportive, helped me with my college (I went to another college due to financial reasons), finished my required years but still kept in touch with my lil bro -Years later, me and J (with the help of his parents) got a small house. (Like really small but I'm happy with it). I ended up giving birth to a sweet baby girl. I let my lil bro know that he could come see her when he was able to.  He came a few times.  -Today, bro came to see the baby, and asked when I was going to let mom and dad see her since they wanted to reconnect. I said never and that I wasn't going to forgive them. Bro says I'm being unreasonable as they were just strict and trying to protect me, I say that's bullshit because Dad shouldn't have kicked me out over age. Bro says I should at least let Mom come because she didn't want to agree with it. I say Mom was able to do something but didn't,but that Bro's situation was different because he was only 15. Bro is upset because he says Mom and Dad regret their decision and just want to reconnect and that I am dragging this entire situation. I told him that if he thinks I'm 'dragging it out' then he can stay out of my life too. He's angry and says that I need to move on and that I shouldn't be withholding them from seeing THEIR grandchild. I say that THEY disowned me and so have no grandchild from a daughter that doesn't exist.  AITA? I don't hate my bro and I (kinda)  get what he is saying, but I just have a resentment for my parents. It's not like I had a baby just to put it against them,  but my lil bro thinks I'm going go die on a hill with them for something done several years ago and it's petty. I'm curious on what reddit thinks. I want a relationship with my bro, just not my mom and dad",

I asked her why as we both make pretty good money at our jobs, and we can't afford our current lifestyle with just one income. she says it's because I make a lot more (which is true, I make about 40% more) than her and we could scale back our lifestyle - and said it's been on my mind a lot - I think working 9-5 just isn't for me I asked her if she was being serious, and she confirmed that she is. I said that I'm not comfortable with that idea, and said maybe if we have kids she could be a stay-at-home mom but I'm not cool with her being a stay-at-home wife. and she said that I was being manipulative. since we're both child-free. but I just said that as a hypothetical - since I'm not at all okay with being the sole 'bread-winner. that divulged into a pretty heated argument. with her saying that I should support her dreams (she never stated what she wants to do with her staying at home, even though I did ask) so this is where I may be the asshole - in the heat of the moment I said where is this coming from,  why is it your dream to be a stay-at-home wife? is it your dream to be lazy? she got really upset at that, and had gone to her mothers and said we'll talk more when you calm down I'll be real here, I don't want her to be a stay at home wife, I'm not okay with being the sole breadwinner, and I do not wish to support this dream - I want a partner in life, not a dependant doing nothing productive with their days. aita?",

My moms definitely pissed that I said that, I can tell. But I'm also upset the person who birthed me is trying to get me to pay what I would pay a landlord for rent just to sleep in her house.  Even 100 a week I would have been more inclined to be okay with, but 600 a month just to be able to sleep at my parents house seems a little high. If I am paying $600 a month I think I would deserve my own spaces around the house also as I would with a landlord, it seems having a landlord would be a better deal for me in this case. ",

It was hard living for a long time money-wise but I always tried to do best by my son. Today I own my own gym and my son is now 22 and going to college and works at my gym full-time. He came out to me when he was 14 years old and I\u2019ve always been supportive of him and his identity.  I\u2019ve been with my fianc\u00e9 now for about 2 years and while she does come from a very deep religious and conservative family, she has never had any issue with my son \u2013 at least nothing she has ever expressed to me. My son has been dating his boyfriend since he was 18 and I\u2019ve gotten to know him really well. However my fianc\u00e9 told me recently that she does not want my son\u2019s boyfriend to come to the wedding nor does she want her parents to even get the inclination that my son is gay. That if they found out, they would have a complete fit. This really bothered me because I refuse to ask my son to go back in the closet. What is going to happen in the future? When my son gets married himself? Will they want him and his husband barred from other family events? He\u2019s my son and will be the best man and it would be unfair to deny him a plus one because her family has an issue with gay people. When I told her this, she got very angry with me and told me that I was being selfish and over-dramatic \u2013 that it would just be for this one day, that she wants the perfect wedding. I told her that this was unacceptable and that I was not going to ask my son not to bring his boyfriend. It\u2019s my wedding too and I was his boyfriend there.  After that I got the silent treatment for a day and since then it hasn\u2019t been discussed again. However, it has left an extremely bad taste in my mouth and has me contemplating calling the wedding off. I do not want to marry into a family that would potentially discriminate against my son. I love my fiance very much but my son will always come first. I told my brother and he said that I was being the asshole here \u2013 that it would just be for one day and that since my son is an adult, it\u2019s unlikely that he would have that much interaction with his \u201cstep grandparents\u201d in the future anyway. I still don\u2019t feel comfortable about the entire situation and am really thinking about calling the wedding off. Would I be the asshole if I did this? Am I being unreasonable here?",

We pay the taxes and services / maintenance on the house, our son pays for his groceries and the house utilities. All was going well for a few years, our son meets a girl and they get serious. We met her and she seems nice enough.  The announce their engagement and she moves into the house with our son.   Now for the problem: The wedding !!!  We hold a little get to know you BBQ at the PA house, my son and daughter are there, as are our sons fianc\u00e9 and her parents, and sisters.   We all seem to be getting along well, my wife, daughter and the fianc\u00e9 go into the house along with her mother an sisters and my son.  A few minutes later my wife and daughter come out and are really upset. The come over and tell me we're leaving and driving back to NJ.  I try to find out what happened.  Once we get back to NJ and they calmed down they tell me that our son and his fianc\u00e9 along with her family don't want us at the wedding.  According to what I was told We're not their kind of people.  I was livid, I called my son and asked him WTH this was about.  He tells me that her family feel that we are not good enough and will embarrass them at a family wedding and that we are all uninvited from the wedding.   I let a week go by to calm myself down and drive back to the PA house, the new future in-laws are in the house along with the fianc\u00e9.  It appears that they all moved into the house They ask me why I'm there, I tell them that since we aren't invited to the wedding, I was coming over to talk to my son.  They tell me to leave their house.  I lost it, and told them that they had 30 days to get out.  Tell my son I'm selling the house and he could find somewhere else to live with all of you.  I go to a realtor in town and list the house for sale.  They call my son at work and tell him what I said.  Apparently they thought that he owned the house. He calls me and asks why I'm selling his house, I tell him I paid for it along with the taxes on it and it is mine.  He was living there rent free, but since he doesn't want us in his new life, he has to get out.  I tell him the same as I told his future in-laws they have 30 days to get out then I'll get a lawyer and get them evicted.  Am I the AH for taking a hard stance on this.

For the last two years my brother and his fiance Sarah (32f) have been planning their wedding. And it's coming up in September. I was asked to be a bridesmaid. I figured i was only asked as a courtesy since I'm her soon to be sister in law but I still took it seriously. I have been a bridesmaid for the last two years. Just a few weeks ago I managed to save up to buy the 800 dollar bridesmaid dress. Over all in the last two years between group outings to parties, dinners,  lunches, clothes, etc\u2026 I spent thousands of dollars. Eventually all the girls in the wedding and I became extremely close and I started to get hyped for the wedding.  Sarah recently got close with her brother's wife Becky (30f). Last week she dropped the ball on me that she no longer wants me to be a bridesmaid and she would prefer if Becky would take my place.  It broke my heart a little but it's her wedding and it's not my place to tell her how to run it so I said it was fine. Yesterday I went to my brother's house to pick up the bridesmaid's dress, and was going to see if I could return it since it was within the time frame.  Sarah was completely appalled and said that Becky was going to wear it since she and I are the same size.  I said that would be fine, but they would have to pay me the 800 for it. Sarah said that Becky couldn't afford and I should just be nice and let her use it and said that I could keep it after the wedding.  I explained that I'm not just giving away the dress, and I'm not ever going to usei after the wedding. After some bickering back and forth I just ended up taking it and leaving.   My brother and Sarah tried to compromise with me, and say I could be the assistant flower girl and I felt offended at the offer. After I said no, they then said that Becky could give me 250 bucks for it. Again no and I returned the dress and got a full refund.   I told them I understand that it's their wedding but they are being extremely disrespectful to me and I don't need to deal with it and I'm not going to the wedding. Today my coworker says she has an extra round trip plane ticket to go to Miami that she'll sell to me for half price plus I would have to pay for half the hotel and I can go hang out with her in Florida. The only downside is that I'll be in Florida for the week of my brother's wedding.  So will I be the asshole if I just go party in miami instead of going to my brother's wedding?",

        "selftext": "So I (21F) have been friends with Loreen (22F) for 17 years now and we\u2019re really close. She recently gave birth to her daughter and her and her husband recently told us the name. They decided to name their daughter Ghiuliyette (pronounced Juliet) and her middle name is Mahriya. I thought the spelling was a joke, until she told me they are serious. I told her, that with that spelling of a simple but beautiful name is just going to ruin that little girls life. She got mad and told me to stop \u201eruining\u201c her mood and that I\u2019m being mean. I\u2019m completely honest. The spelling is just bad. Nothing else can explain it. Why ruin such a beautiful name by including letters that don\u2019t belong there?  I texted her yesterday and told her that the little girl will try to change her name or at least go by her middle name since it\u2019s normal. She told me to stop texting her, that I\u2019m a bad friend and that I\u2019m being the asshole for making fun of the name. I don\u2019t think I am. When I told her that the spelling is just bad, she went crazy. She told me that I\u2019m the worst friend ever and that I would never be able to see her daughter again. After that, her husband sent me an email, telling me to stop being so disrespectful. He thinks the spelling is cute and it just makes her unique. Unique-yes. But that\u2019s just going to make that little girl suffer and she will probably be bullied for that spelling. I haven\u2019t replied and honestly I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the asshole here, but I thought I\u2019d ask Reddit since y\u2019all are the best to judge. So, am i the asshole for telling my friend that the name she gave her daughter is bad and will ruin her life? Update: Alright, I get it. I\u2019m an asshole for going after the Name more than once. Sorry for that lmao. I just send her an apology text for doing it, yet I did write how she should try to look at it from another perspective. I also send a few screenshots of the comments just for her to see what other people think of it.FYI I\u2019m supposed to be the godmother, which is why I was extra worried lmao my bad Update 2: Hello again. I\u2019ve been asked if there are any updates and yes there are!So I\u2019ve been talking with Loreen a lot (over text) and she\u2019s slowly starting to notice her \u201emistake\u201c. I apologized again and we are good again. We talked about the name and she told me that she won\u2019t change it and really loves it, but is slowly understanding why it\u2019s weird for others, especially me. Her husband on the other hand is still pretty mad at me. He thinks that I took it too far and that my apologies aren\u2019t from the heart\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. I\u2019ve been asked if I\u2019m still the godmother and yes I am. There were thoughts of changing it, but now that we get along again, I\u2019m back in the role.  Back to the husband: he actually blocked me everywhere and is telling Loreen to do so too because he thinks that I\u2019m manipulating and that I\u2019m lying just so we can get close again. Doesn\u2019t  make sense. Idk. Well either way, it\u2019s getting better with the relationship, just not with the name. ",

        "selftext": "I'm, f33 engaged to my fiance, m36. I have a 4yo daughter and he has a 16 yo daughter. He comes from a conservative family so we won't move in together til after marriage. So far we're on good terms as a blended family. But I noticed that my stepdaughter acts kind of distant towards my daughter. Everytime I try to talk to my fiance about it he'd tell me to give the kids a chance to bond and warm up to each other. My stepdaughter's 16th birthday took place on sunday. Since she's into baking. She decided to bake cupcakes instead of having an actual birthday cake. My daughter and I went over to my fiance's house to attend the party and I brought my stepdaughter a gift which was an iphone. We sat down as she started serving everyone cupcakes. Then when it was my daughter's turn, she bluntly said she was sorry but she didn't save any for my daughter. I felt confused, I asked if she made enough cupcakes and wether there were guests that came uninvited. She said no and that she just didn't make one for my daughter. I asked why, she refused to say. I was so mad and felt hurt on my daughter's behalf. I got up and told my fiance that I wanted to leave. My fiance tried to stop me and offered his cupcake to my daughter but I refused to take it. On the way out, I grabbed the gift I brought for my stepdaughter and she stood there and watched. I could hear her yell dad she took the iphone while I was walking out with my daughter. My fiance tried to get me to go back inside but I refused. Later, He came over and we had an argument. He said that I overreacted, and that I know how some teenagers can be moody and do random stuff without an explanation so I shouldn't have taken it personally. I said she excluded my daughter and didn't save her a cupcake but he said it was just a cupcake and then reminded me that he offered his cupcake and said I should've accepted it and called it a day. He said taking the iphone *which was supposed to be a gift* back was poor taste and it might hurt my relationship with his daughter. I refused to give it to him so he could give it to her since she was crying about it. He left and was mad at me. We haven't talked since then except via texts. Edit# She's been wanting the iphone for a while and since her dad couldn't buy it I decided it'd be nice if I gifted it to her. For those who are asking how a teenager could own an iphone. ???? I'm sorry if it's uncommon where you live but where I live, Iphones are the most common phones. also, I saw that she served her girlfriend a whole plate of cupcakes so it's not like she baked a specific number.",

My husband (m36) works an office job and because he's a family-oriented type of guy, he always hangs put with his family. His family live on a ranch in the middle of literally nowhere. It's a hassle to go there and due to my work nature, I don't go to most of their functions, I do however make sure to attend the big ones. Last week, his family wanted to host a BBQ party. He wanted me to go with him so badly since all his brothers were bringing their wifes and since they mocked him for coming alone in the past. I said sorry but I had a shift to cover. He begged, suggested I swap shifts with other nurses who are my friends and even called them all to beg them to cover for me. I grew irritated and told him to stop it. He sulked for a whole day then dropped it. In the morning, and hours before my shift I discovered that my car's tires were out of air. My husband offered to drive me to the hospital at 4pm and I agreed. I got ready and we got in the car but instead of taking me to the hospital, he drove me straight to his family's ranch. I was dumbfounded and angry after he said he tricked me into attending this BBQ and that I had to suck it up and set this shift out. I was so mad I didn't know what to say. We got to the ranch and I sat outside fuming. I waited and saw I still had time to make it to the hospital if I figured out a way to get there. I watched my husband go inside leaving his Keychain next to me (right where he was sitting) I took it and rushed to the back where all cars were parked, got into the car and drove off. His dad saw me and told him. He started calling my phone relentlessly til I turned it off. I got to the hospital in time but didn't dare turn my phone on til it was past 8 pm. I opened it and saw tons of angry messages from him berating me calling me horrible and a manipulator. I got on the phone with him and he yelled about the awful stunt I pulled and bailing from the party and making him look bad infront of his family. He then calmed down and said that he now knows that work is more important to me and that he won't ever trust me afteri basically stole his car and ran with it. We've been on terrible terms since then. His family are also mad but I haven't spoken to them about it yet nor calcified anything. AITA for what I did? I was desperate and worried that messing my shift might cost me my job.",

After the baby shower my sister pulled me aside and asked why I didn\u2019t pick nothing out off her registry. I had said I saw those and thought they were cute and the registry is just a suggestion. My sister got annoyed and said the registry is stuff they actually need and that I gave her useless things, then walked away. I guess she talked to my mom because my mom also said to me I should\u2019ve just picked something from there because I know how my sister is and it would\u2019ve helped her out.

        "selftext": "I (40m) have a sister (30f) who is getting married in a week. The groom proposed to her a year ago at a family dinner that left everyone speechless, but very happy for them as they are longtime companions. During this dinner, my sister asked my son (17m) to make her wedding dress. My son has always loved design and fashion, he took technical courses in these areas and sewing, and even his friends keep asking for his clothes because they are so beautiful. He agreed, but said that he needed time and that he would need her opinion constantly.  At first my sister was very annoying. My son drew about 50 dress designs in a month and she only liked one, which he continued with. He sewed it with great quality fabric which I paid for as I wanted to get involved in a certain way. For five months he made several adjustments to suit her wishes, as she always complained about something. After a while, he arrived at the final model and it was just amazing. My mother cried seeing my sister in the dress and I confess that I almost got emotional too.  The problem was that last week my son came to talk to me about the wedding invitation that had not arrived for him, but for other family members. I thought maybe he didn't need one, but it still felt weird. I messaged my sister raising this issue and she replied that she didn't want any underage people at her wedding because there would be alcohol. I asked if she was going to make an exception for my son, but she cut me off and said no.  There are no children in our family, my son is the only minor, so I didn't see any sense in this rule for family members. And to make matters worse, my son was very sad and cried because he spent months on this dress and couldn't go to the wedding. I was very upset and told my sister that she should look for another dress as soon as possible, as she would no longer wear the one my son made.  She called and yelled at me, saying I was being unreasonable and that I couldn't do this. My mother called me saying I should deliver the dress and follow the rules, but I didn't and hung up on her. Because of this, the family is divided. Many agree with me and condemn my sister's action saying she could only make an exception, but another part says I'm unreasonable and I'm spoiling her big day.  I don't think I'm being wrong but just rational and paying her back in kind. So AITA? UPDATE:  first I would like to thank all the comments and suggestions, I really didn't expect my post to resonate so much.  I talked to my son about the suggestions you guys gave me and he agreed to sell the dress at market price. He calculated the price of everything and the value was quite high. We sent the proposal to my sister and she hated it. She said she couldn't afford it because it was too expensive and it should be a gift because she is family. I responded by saying that it was too easy to say she was family to get a free dress, but not enough to include my son. She cried on the call and begged me not to ruin her day, but I didn't call because that to me was bullshit.  At no point did she offer to just let my son go or apologize for it.  And for anyone who said that maybe she's homophobic, I'm not sure, but I think who could be influencing her is her fianc\u00e9 who is a Christian and has never been close to my son. However, I don't care if he's doing it or not. If she wants to exclude my son from this event then she will also be cutting ties with me.  And for those who are asking for a photo of the dress, I'm sorry to disappoint you, but my son didn't agree and unfortunately I won't post it because of that.  If anything else happens I'll let you know, until then, thank you all!",

        "selftext": "My girlfriend [31f] and I [36m] have been together for about two years now. We live together. About nine months ago I picked up running as a hobby and I have since grown quite fond of it. I currently run an average of 25 miles a week. A few months ago I decided I wanted to try a 5k or 10k, and after some Google searching found a 5k in my city that looked fun. I registered for it, paid the fee, and decided to start training specifically for it. I mentioned it in passing to my girlfriend that night, and she asked if she could come too. I was psyched about the idea of running a 5k with her and said yes, but warned her that she would probably want to start training because I was going for a sub-27 minute time, which might be tough for a complete beginner. She said she would like to train with me, which, again, sounded fun. The next morning I woke up at 5am for my run as I usually do, but my girlfriend was not up for it and told me she'd go later. This continued for a week, and then two weeks, and finally I managed to get her up once for a run. She was miserable the entire time and I basically didn't get any exercise.  Last Friday, the day before the race, I asked if she was really up for it. She insisted she was. She then told me that she would just skip-gallop it, like she used to do with her mile runs in middle school. I asked her to demonstrate what a skip-gallop was, and she showed me this bizarre side-stepping gallop, as if she had casts on her legs. I told her it seemed like a really inefficient way to run, but she insisted it always worked for her. Saturday was the day of the race and right out of the gate she utilized her skip-gallop strategy. Two minutes in I realized that she was already completely gassed. She started asking me to wait so we could walk together. I apologized, told her I loved her, and left her behind to finish the race. I ended up with a time of 26:43, beating my goal. After the race I tried calling her but she wouldn't pick up. When I made my way back to the car I realized she had left me. I took an Uber home, and right when I walked in the door, I was met with cry-shrieking about how I ditched her. I tried to calm her down and explain that she kind of brought it on herself but she was not interested whatsoever. Yesterday she gave me the silent treatment all day.

        "selftext": "Many years ago, I was married to man named Mark. 2 years into the marriage, I found out he was cheating on me and got the other woman pregnant. It was a huge blow because I too was pregnant with his child. I was only 9 weeks pregnant and was determined to abort the child and divorce him. He begged me to reconsider, and insisted I give our relationship a second chance, and so I did, albeit reluctantly.  I had a very unhappy pregnancy and when I was 6 months pregnant, I learned that he never stopped seeing the other woman. He told me that he was torn and that he was in love with both of us. I wasn't willing to tolerate any of that bullshit, so I moved out and filed for divorce. I wanted him to disappear from my life, but being pregnant with his child made things difficult.  I never bonded with the baby , and the baby being his offspring contributed to the negative emotions that I felt.  I told him that I didn't want this baby. So when he got together with the other woman, I gave her the choice to adopt the baby, which she did. With that, I officially signed over my parental rights as soon as the girl turned 6 months old (I left the day she was born). When I left, I told Mark that I didn't want anything to do with the girl and the other woman was free to be her mother.  I moved to another country and tried to leave that part of my life behind. I met a wonderful man and we got married. He knew all about my past and now we have 3 wonderful kids who are 9, 5 and 2 years old.  Recently, my ex Mark contacted me out of the blue and told me that my biological daughter, who is 14 now, wants to meet me. Apparently, his wife had passed away and before she died, she confessed that she wasn't her biological mother.  I'm torn. I don't want to meet this kid. It was very difficult for me to leave that part of my life behind. I was depressed for years. I reminded him that I gave up my parental rights years ago and that I wanted nothing to do with both of them. I planned on telling my kids about their half sibling once they were grown and mentally mature, not right now when they are still so little. I told him to never contact me again and hanged up.

My husband\u2019s parents, his 2 brothers (ages 38 and 40ish), and his brothers\u2019 girlfriends/fianc\u00e9es have a tradition of going out to dinner once a month. I am invited about 50% of the time. I\u2019ve talked to my husband\u2019s brother\u2019s fianc\u00e9e, and she says she is invited every time.  When I say I\u2019m not invited, I mean that my husband tells me \u201cI\u2019m going to the family dinner. It\u2019s probably best if you sit this one out.\u201d When I expressed that I wanted to come, he told me that it would be for the best if I didn\u2019t. It has caused several fights. About a week ago, my husband went to a family dinner that I wasn\u2019t invited to. I was very pissed. So earlier that day, I called and made a reservation at the restaurant they were going to. My husband left the house, not knowing about my reservations, and I left 15 minutes after him.  I ended up seated at a table where I couldn\u2019t see his family. So I got up as if I was going to the bathroom and walked right past them. They were all there, including his brothers\u2019 SOs. My husband looked completely shocked and asked me what I was doing there. I told him that I had just been dying for a steak, so I came and got one at the restaurant.  My mother in law said it was very rude of me to interrupt their family dinner. I pointed out that I wasn\u2019t trying to join them, I was just going to the bathroom. I told them to have a good meal and I left. I went and finished my steak by myself. My husband was really pissed when he came home, and he told me that he couldn\u2019t believe how much of an asshole I had been. I said that he was an asshole for not inviting me to his dinners when his brothers\u2019 SOs got to go. My husband said that the decision to invite was between him and his family, and I should respect it.  Anyway, with the way the word asshole was thrown around, it made me think of this sub. So I wanted to ask if I am the asshole. Am I? Edit: I don\u2019t know how to add an update in this sub, so there is an update posted to my profile",

        "selftext": " I f32 just got engaged to my fiance m37 Sam. We do not live together because we're waiting til marriage given he and his family are highly conservative Christians but they're really nice and loveable people.  I had plans to spend NYE with Sam but he said he was out for NYE dinner celebration with his parents then called me again inviting me to join them and I happily did. His parents were there, <they welcomed me and ordered many dishes and desserts and drinks. We celebrated and had great time that is until it was time to pay. I pulled my wallet out of my bag letting them know that we'll split the check between us. Sam mumbled no you don't have to, we invited you but I insisted. He and his parents then stared at me; I asked what was wrong and both MIL & FIL said they didn't have money on them. I was shocked I turned to Sam and he said he too forgot his wallet at home and didn't bring enough money to cover even on round of drinks. His dad then laughed nervously aright so guess we should let the doctor pay!! I was taken a back I said I'm sorry but no this is just so much money to spend on one dinner by myself and I didn't think I was expected to pay the entire bill. Sam said I should pay and he'd pay me back later but I said no since I know he will have to get a job to pay that much money. I said I'm sorry but this isn't the first time I've been put in this situation by him and family where I'm expected to rescue them after they somehow forgot their wallets and expectbothers to pay hundreds for their extravagant dinner. I told them I'll only pay for what I had and that's it, he and his parents were shocked. They started arguing about how I have the potential to pay right there and then but I was acting as if they were strangers not family but that doesn't mean I'm obligated to pay, how could someone go out to a fancy restuarant, order so many dishes, desserts and drinks without bringing money?. Sam begged that I just do it and call it a night but I refused. The argument got heated then I got up and walked out. Sam called later at 2am basically yelling that I ruined NYE celebration and made his parents suffer because I refused to pay the entire bill amd instead acted selfishly and paid only for myself after they were gracious enough to invite me. I told him how unfair it was for me to pay even if I have a good salary doesn't mean I want to spend it all on fancy dinner. He didn't reply he just said he'll pray that my parents will let this go and not resent me after I basically damaged the relationship with them. I felt awful thinking I should've covered the bill instead of leaving. AITA?",

I got a raise on my salary. now I earn 30% more than he does and I noticed that he's been using this to ask me to pay for him and his friends. Whenever I say no or why should I pay for this? he'd respond with the 30% that's why. he acts as if the 30% is unfair or that I'm not dserveing of it. Several times he has tricked me to pay for his and his friend's meals by asking me publicly. Let me say that I'm too nice to say no, I hate confrontation especially when we're at a public place like a restaurant so I just grin and pay. Last tuesday, he asked me to join him and his buddies for dinner. I told him from the start I wasn't paying for their food and he shouldn't expect me to. He said he got this and no worries. We got to the restaurant. Met his friends, ordered food. And in the middle of the meal he leaned in and whispered that I would be paying for everything he and his friends ordered. I got so mad I whispered back noooo but he probably relied on me not causing a scene in public and infront of his friends. he said you have enough money you could pay for everyone's food, 30% remember?. I was fuming inside. instead of reacting negatively and losing my temper. I waited til the bills arrived (they were already split from the start when we first ordered) I paid for mine then I excused myself to the restroom. I then sneaked out from there, got into my car and went home. I started getting phonecalls from my fiance then texts asking where I was. I texted back saying I didn't appreciate how he put me in this situation and basically tricking me into paying for his and his friends food. I told him I went home then stopped replying. An hour later he came and started yelling at me calling me selfish, irrational, cheapskate and childish for sneaking out like that and leaving him stuck with a bill he could not pay (He had to call his brother for help). We had a loud argument then he walked out. His friends didn't speak to me on this but he told me they're disappointed in my behavior and are telling him to take time and reflect on the type of woman he's gonna be married to. AITA for what I did? Is what he's expecting from me fair or justified?. ETA: Some info: (1) he said that because the restaurant wasn't expensive then I could have just paid. (2) He admitted not telling me about it til later knowing I'd refuse. He still thinks my reaction was childish and unacceptable.",

I immediately shut down that idea and told her we would have to think of something else because there's no way I'm charging my son to live in our house. She said it was reasonable since I was paying most of his college tuition but I told her there are alternatives. I suggested we stopped eating out so much because it's $50-$100 per meal but she didn't like that idea. I suggested other things which she rejected so I told her I'm open to suggestions but my son isn't going to be our source of income. she told me I should think more of her than my son.

        "selftext": "Married 15 years and almost didn't make it this far.  In our second year of marriage my wife went home when I was deployed and slept with Some Dickhead (who I'll refer to as SD from here out) who she was loose acquaintances with growing up.  She hadn't seen him in years but he just happened to show up during my daughter's birthday party because he was the son of one of my mother-in-law's old friends.  SD and my wife hooked up later that week after reconnecting.  The reason I didn't kick my wife's ass to the curb and eventually forgave her is because she told me herself soon after I got home.  And she didn't try to justify it with the oh well you were gone, i felt lonely blah blah blah.  No she actually said straight up that she was a fucking dumbass (her words not mine, though I agree) and she felt so sick and disgusting for doing it.  She immediately cut off all contact with SD and it took a lot of counseling and healing but here we are today; feels like non-stop since that time that my wife has gone above and beyond proving that I was right to keep her.  Well my mother-in-law called yesterday and she heard from SD's mother that SD died in some workplace accident and they're having a funeral service this weekend.  My wife told me this and that she wanted to go and it was like I got kicked right in the dick.  I instantly felt nauseous and had fucking horrible flashbacks of when she told me about her affair. All those horrible feelings resurfaced along with the shitty memories of me crying my fucking eyes out and my image of her shattering.  The pain felt as fresh as when she dropped that bomb on me.  I asked her why seeing as she hadn't talked to the guy in over a decade not to mention...you know....she fucked him while we were married.  She keeps saying shit like it's the right thing to do and she just wants to pay respects.  I can't stop repeating that I'm so hurt with that decision as he's had no part of her life in so long and I'm re-living all those shitty nights I was sure our family would be shattered and I would only see my daughter 50% of the time.  After some back and forth I put my fucking foot down and told her NO, she cannot go.  I said it's so disrespectful to me and our marriage and we've been on the silent treatment since then.  AITA?  EDIT: Seems like people are starting to trip up on me saying feels like non-stop since that time that my wife has gone above and beyond proving that I was right to keep her. as if I'm saying I own her and she's a piece of property to me.  That is not the case, I am simply illustrating that she didn't just say she'll do better, she proved it with her actions and has made me a very happy man in our time together. EDIT 2: I apologize for nothing and honestly it brings a happy tear to my eye to to see so many people referring to him as SD, because that's what he was.  Fuck 'im. A lot of people are saying it's her decision to make and it is but that doesn't mean I have to like it or support it, and yes right at this point I can see myself walking away if she insists on going.  We're going to counseling starting tomorrow",

        "selftext": "I (46M) live with my wife and my 17 year old son. My wife has been on a different continent for about a month taking care of her dying mother, so it has just been me and my son for that time. My son and I have a very close relationship where he tells me almost everything going on in his life. On Saturday, he told me that he was going to his first ever high school party this upcoming weekend. He was a bit nervous since he had never really drank before, but he knew that he was going to on that occasion. I'm not sure if this is relevant, but this is in Canada where the drinking age is 19 (in my province), and teenage drinking is very common. I asked my son if he wanted to have a few beers with me while we watched a sports game that night, as a test run of sorts. My logic was that if he goes into the party with zero awareness of his tolerance then it could end badly, and it would be best for him to find out his limit in the safety of his home with me. We had some beers over a few hours in the night, and I cut him off at 6 (he has had beer in the past, but never more than one at a time). He was pretty drunk but he was okay, and slept it off. We talked about it the next day, and we agreed that six was a bit much for him, and now he knows to have fewer than that at the party. I was actually pretty content with this whole situation, since he had his first experience drinking in a safe environment, and I feel much more comfortable with him going to a party now. However, in an effort to be transparent I told my wife about it the other day over the phone, and she was livid. She thinks it was reckless and irresponsible. AITA? INFO: I understandably am getting flack for not telling my wife beforehand, but I figured she had enough going on and I didn't need to bother her with something that seemed pretty trivial at the time EDIT: Thanks for all the comments, I am reading every single one! I appreciate the different perspectives",

Over the past few years my 23m son has been genuinely upset that I will not transfer my GI BILL to him. Those unfamiliar with the military, service members are able to transfer their education benefits to their spouse or children after serving a certain amount of time. However, I accidentally exhausted my GI BILL.  My daughter and oldest son never really showed interest in college, nor were my sons grades of the best.  Once my son moved out after HS our communication was minimal. Our relationship prior to him moving out was alao strained. As a parent, I hope I am not the only one to say my son and I just did not get along and could never seem to connect as he got older and got worse the older he got. About two years ago of him going no contact he messeged me, not to ask how we were doing or anything, but straight to the point that its my fault that he no longer qualifies for grants due to our incomes combined and why I did not transfer my GI BILL to him. I Informed him that I had exhausted it and that he is more than welcome to speak to a recruiter.  He then said I should have set 50-100 aside each month to pay for his college. At this point I call him entitled and told him I don't owe him anything once he moved out of my household.  (Summerized conversation) We go no contact again for a little over a year and recently another messege straight to the point asking how I exhausted my GI BILL, again told him he can go see a recruiter about it. Non,the less this conversation still ended on that I should be responsible for his college.  Let it be clear, before I joined the army I was a single parent having my first child at 17, living in poverty making less that 11k a year. I joined the army at 25, paying for college tuition out of pocket was never an option. I did the best I could as a parent and I know I would never win mother of the year. In both conversation I did apologize for the mistakes I made along the way. As, it's clear they bother him, but this conversation ended with him stating he does not view me as his mother and blocked me on everything. He made it clear to his sister that he does not view me as his mother and I am nothing more than an egg donor.   It is time for me to update my life insurance and do a will and I am considering excluding him. WIBTAH?",

I call my husband and tell him and he\u2019s like \u201cOh ok did you get on the pill?\u201d And I said no, I didn\u2019t want to be on hormones anymore and he flipped out and said I need to be on birth control because it\u2019s the best way to not get pregnant but like, there are things he can do to not get me pregnant but now his whole family and him are convinced I\u2019m like trying to get pregnant without his consent.

        "selftext": "I am black, and my wife is also black. I spent my most of my childhood in the foster system, but for a good part of it I was taken care of by an elderly Russian gentleman (we'll call him Dimitri Petrovitch). While he never formally adopted me, he played a major role in my upbringing, and I am very grateful for all that he has done for me. Unfortunately, he passed away many years ago, and he never had any children.  Fast forward to today, my wife and I recently had a son, and to honor the memory of my mentor, I decided (with my wife's approval) to name my kid Dimitri Petrovitch Williams. Williams being my last name, and Petrovitch being my son's middle name. However, it seems like it's only my wife and I who likes this name, as her extended family has been quite upset over it, saying things like What kinda name is Dimitri?, or You ain't white, you ain't Russian, why did you give your son such as a white name.  It's true that there's no part of me that's Russian (I an barely speak Russian), but I feel like he's been such a big part of my upbringing that I had to honor him somehow. I confided in my friends too, and they said something along the lines of You a black man and you gotta be proud of your own culture. You gave your son an identity that he's not even a part of, he's gonna have a hard time in school with that name. So my wife's family aren't happy with our decision, and it seems like my friends don't really have my back either. I'm keeping the name that's for sure, but should I have reconsidered? Maybe I could've honored my mentor in another way?",

I don\u2019t believe that a grounding and a confiscation of electronics is harsh enough for what Sam did, so I told Sam that she won\u2019t be allowed to participate in homecoming or attend senior prom.

Finally, I told her that she\u2019ll have to delete all of her social media accounts with either me or her mother watching.  Sam begged me to allow her to go to senior prom because it\u2019s a once in a lifetime event, and keep just her Instagram account because it had pictures going back years that weren\u2019t saved anywhere else. I told her that she shouldn\u2019t have been a racist bully.  My parents are temporarily staying with us while their house is undergoing renovations.

        "selftext": "Me (M25) and my wife of over a year (F26) (together for over 4) have always had a good relationship with each other. It has felt very love filled. We recently got into an apartment, one bedroom like 700 square ft so not huge. Once this happened I feel like things may have shifted. I work very long hours throughout the week with sometimes only one or maybe zero days off in the week, average of 75-80 hours a week. I bring home a majority of the money, (my paychecks are almost over 80% our whole income) not that it affects how I think of her and our relationship.  She is able to provide things like fun groceries (snacks/sweets) and when we go out she can pay for things like the tip or drinks and I really appreciate that and tell her thank you when she can swing it. She also does most of the chores in the small apt. Other than that I'm the person paying for our life. (Groceries/toiletries/outings/clothes/makeup and not to mention rent and all other real bills) She works in a VERY different field and works  3 sometimes if her job requires, 4 days a week. She is working toward her career and I'm proud of her for this. Most days she'll work an average of 6 maybe 7 hours on her work days. This is where the problem has started.  Alot of my work nights are late, 12 or 1 am when I get home. Ill pack snacks but never get to eat. So alot of days I come home hungry for an actual meal. Recently those nights have been more frequent and i just don't want to have to cook something for myself after a 13 hour day after doing the same all week. I just want to be able to eat with the minimal amount of work when I get home. The other night I came home around 1:30AM and found my wife passed out on the couch with an empty personal pizza from Little Ceasars. I got excited thinking that I had a cold one in the fridge waiting for me.....wrong. annoyed but not upset, I microwave some chef boyardee, scarf it down and call it a night. The next day I have the same kind of night, around 1:30 I get home. There she is passed out, now with a bowl of macaroni and weenies (one of my favorites) and again. Nothing in the fridge for me.  Not understanding why she couldn't just make enough for the both of us and put my bowl in the fridge, wake her up to ask. She gets a little snappy if someone wakes her up but this time she was pissed.Saying that she is NOT my maid and I'm being lazy trying to make her cook for me. I tell her I'm just hungry after a long day and it upset me seeing she cooked for herself and didn't think about me at all. I said she was being inconsiderate and that really set her off. Saying if I want a slave then she's not it. I told her I don't want a slave, I want a wife who seems to care about me. She looked at me with a shocked face and stormed out.  Her mother texted saying she showed up at their house balling and HOW I should be more considerate to her feelings. I haven't even responded because I just feel hurt and not cared for. I just wanted dinner. AITA? Edit: i really should have mentioned this is a conversation we have had before and i feel ignored since she barely acknowledges when ive brought it up. These last 2 times are after multiple conversations . Also definitely didn't want to seem like she shouldn't be sleeping at 1. Passed out is just terminology I use. If I'm dead asleep at 4 am I'm passed out. I appreciate the other things she does for me like cleaning but the other 8 hours of free time in her day I wanted to be thought of since I would do the same for her no questions.",

        "selftext": "So I'm the owner of a wonderful rescued macaw. She is a wonderful bird but has a lot of issues due to an abusive former home. I've had her for 3 years and since then haven't taken any vacations or trips away as it would be too disruptive for her. She distrusts everyone and is very reliant on her routine. I love her deeply and I'm happy to make sacrifices for her. They are permanent toddlers and very intelligent birds. I met my husband by the time his kids were older, my stepdaughter was 16 at the time. We married when she moved away for college. Nevertheless I thought we'd managed to have a decent relationship, until now... my stepdaughter is getting married in March, and naturally there's a lot of preparation involved. They're wanting a huge traditional wedding and she is stressed out of her mind. They live out of state, and she invited me recently to come visit her for a week to help make wedding plans and spend time with their 2yo. I declined and she insisted to know why, acting very hurt, and I explained the parrot... Well jt all went downhill from there.  She caused a massive fuss with her dad, saying she never got a mother figure and I never accepted her as my full blood daughter and this is the ultimate snub for a silly animal. That I'm cold and emotionless... I feel really hurt and I can tell he agrees with her even though he's refusing to take sides. But I don't see why I should be expected to take holiday time off work to babysit and bond all of a sudden and I don't see how I'm a monster for this... am I the asshole here? Edit: context of our relationship, we don't usually talk at all and she hasn't visited home in 4 years. Edit 2: Beginning to think it was maybe a mistake posting this. Mostly because this is a real and nuanced situation and reddit is no place for nuance, and maybe personal relationships shouldn't be judged in the AH context in the first place. But also because I should be more understanding and a bigger person regardless of who is or isn't the asshole. Life is too short to be butthurt and offended. I called my stepdaughter and told her that I understand this is a big moment in her life and she wants someone there to help and support her, and that I'm still willing to help her in any way I can to plan the wedding via zoom and virtually. We talked a bit and I asked her why she hadn't accepted me reaching out in the past and she apologised and said she didn't want to accept someone as a stand-in, fake replacement for her bio mom, but now she regrets it and would like a closer relationship, especially seeing how close her SO is with his mom. We ended the conversation positively and I'm hoping things can improve going forward. I told her I'm a crazy bird lady and asked her if she still wants a relationship knowing that and she said that after the wedding she's willing to travel to visit us if we have room... which we do. I'll leave this post up but I'm happy either way and I'm glad the feedback here motivated me to make the call.",

        "selftext": "I (F55) had been married to my husband (M60) for 20 years before he died. It was cancer.  He had two kids from a past marriage who were in their early teens when he married me. I had a 7 year old from an earlier relationship as well. We didn't have anymore kids.  I tried to treat my step children as my own but they never accepted me. They were very rude and insulted me whenever they could. Since I did not work they called me a gold digger who married their dad only for his money.  The truth was my grandparents were quite wealthy and left me a lot of money when they died. I lived well below my means and chose to stay home and raise my daughter, since I could afford that. I did not need his money at all. But I didn't bother sharing this with his kids and told him not to either. I did not want them to like me just because they might gain monetarily from me.  My husband on the other hand hated how they behaved with me. Their blatant disrespect made him not pay for their College tuition. Their mom couldn't pay for it and they had to take loans for it. They didn't even talk to him.  Even when he got cancer, they refused to come see him. For three years we struggled with the treatment. My daughter came to visit from time to time, when she could.  During this time only person who really helped both of us was someone we were not related to at all. This girl in her late 20s waitressed at a cafe we frequented. She was a single mom, taking classes at community college at night, working during day and raising her two kids. She took a liking to us and when she learned my husband was sick, spend whatever time she could visiting him. She has stayed nights at the hospital when I needed a break and basically been the daughter we wished for.  When he died, she helped me arrange the funeral. His kids came on the day and all they wanted to know was about their inheritance. I felt sick.  When I learned my husband has left his estate to me, (whatever is left after settling his bills, and it was around $25000), I decided to give it to the girl who helped us both so much. She tried to refuse but I insisted she take it. She needed it and in my opinion deserved it more than the ungrateful children.  My daughter understands why I did not give it to his children but is upset I did not give anything to her either. I told her she already had money and a job. Not to mention she will get my inheritance. This was in no way her money.  But his ex wife and kids are causing havoc over this and really upset with me. They are calling me AH for giving away money they deserve.  AITA?",

        "selftext": "Throwaway because I'm sorry of embarrassed about this.  I met a dude on tinder a few weeks ago, and we seemed to really hit it off. We had a lot of the same hobbies, and I felt a spark between us that I'm sure he felt too. After we got passed the talking phase, we decided to meet at his house for coffee.  It was great when I arrived. We talked loads, and even held hands! However, I was on the third day of my period, and after a couple hours I needed to change my pad. I ask for the bathroom, and he directs me to it.  After I finish changing, I notice his trashcan is pretty full. Not sure what to do I wrap it in toilet paper and sort of smooth it into the trash can so it isn't sitting on the edge.  We hang out for about an hour more and be excuses himself to the bathroom. A few minutes pass by and he comes out, and says he needs to talk with me. He says that I shouldn't of thrown away my pad because he might touch it when taking out the trash, and that it was gross and unsanitary. Apparently he saw that the trash looked different, unwrapped the toilet paper, and saw my used pad.  I was mortified. I apologized profusely, and he seemed to take it well. He just told me not to do it again, and if I needed to, just walk a few blocks to a nearby grocery store to change. I left after that, not think too much of it.  However, I've recounted the events to a few friends, and they think he's a major asshole. I'm not entirely sure. He was really kind about it, and didn't seem to get angry, but I'm also starting to see their point too. It's a normal body process for people with a uterus and I agree, should be more normalized. I'm just not sure what to think, and any judgement would be greatly appreciated.",

        "selftext": "Okay, she\u2019s not my SIL yet but I used it to make the title simpler. She\u2019s my boyfriend\u2019s borther\u2019s girlfriend. I (f28) have been with my boyfriend (m32, Ian) for 3 years. We\u2019ve decided to host a small, early Christmas dinner. One of the people invited was his brother, Jake (m26). Jake asked if he could bring his girlfriend as she was all alone (they\u2019ve been together for 3 months) and we agreed, the more the merrier. His girlfriend, Naveah (f28) seemed a bit timid but lovely. Naveah brought her 8 year old son (that we didn\u2019t know was coming). She seemed lovely right until she went to the bathroom, she came out shrieking,box of my tampon she in her hand, literally gasping for air in between her shrieks. I could barely understand her. Turns out, my box of tampons was visible (duuuh, it\u2019s within a reach because hey, I need it monthly, why should I hide it and then look for it). She was going off about being disgusting, how could I be so shameless to have this in front of a child and other men and so on. I looked at her in disbelief, I couldn\u2019t believe she made a scene about a box of tampons, has she never been in a shop? Anyway, I told her that my tampons stay where they are but if she\u2019s so pressed, she can leave and go home where no tampons are present. She turned red, quite literally, her face was bright pink. Huffing and puffing, she dressed her kid and told Jake to drive her home which he did. Jake didn\u2019t come back but he called from her house telling Ian that I was the asshole. I was surprised to hear that Ian (my boyfriend) agreed with him. I thought he would be on my side. We were about to argue but I decided it wasn\u2019t worth it and went to my office to cool down and think this through. Am I the asshole for telling her to leave?",

        "selftext": "A little bit of context for you all, I ended up falling pregnant with my 10 year old daughter during a drunken hook-up with a friend in my mid 20s. Not the most glamourous or flattering truth but it's the truth all the same. When we found out we decided to keep the child and co-parent while remaining friends. We were never a couple and we didn't want to be one either. Four years ago he began to date his longterm girlfriend and they moved in together last year. She fell pregnant and i've been supportive to them both as much as I could be without crossing any lines; i've encouraged my daughter to help out whenever she's staying with them during the pregnancy and to behave, i've also made it clear that I want the children to have a close relationship despite having different Mothers, i've even said that if they were comfortable with it on nights I have my daughter if they ever want time alone i'll babysit once they have the baby so my daughter can spend time with her sibling. All in all, I thought everything was great and I was excited for my daughter to have a sibling as she's always wanted one but I had no interest in having another child. Three days ago my friend and his girlfriend had a daughter, they asked me to bring my daughter to the hospital to meet her little sister yesterday alongside others of the family. So I did exactly that but when they introduced us to the baby I was shocked. They'd named used my daughters name. She didn't seem to have any issue with this when she introduced the baby bold as brass. My friend seemed uncomfortable and wouldn't look at me directly. I asked them what they were playing at, at which point my friends father said he'd take my daughter down to the cafeteria to get something to eat and left with her. My friend told me to calm down and not overreact while his girlfriend told me she didn't see the issue and it was a pretty name. I asked them if they'd named the baby for my daughter trying to understand the logic here but his girlfriend said that no it was just a pretty name she liked. I then asked if they planned to use a nickname or a middle name when addressing to her on a daily basis and her response was that she didn't see a need for that. I told them they were being ridiculous and that they couldn't do this, I then told his girlfriend that I found this frankly creepy and told my friend he was being spineless if he was happy to go along with this. He tried to claim our daughter could use a nickname or something but I shut that down immediately asking why it was more reasonable for a girl who has used that name for a decade to shame her name compared to a baby who had no concept of what a name was yet. His girlfriend told me I was being a bitch talking to her like that after she just gave birth and asked the nurses to remove me saying I was being disruptive. Maybe my temper is running a little too hot though and I was too harsh on her when she just gave birth. It's just so fucking weird. Edit: I'd also like to state, I know that what they want to name their child is their choice, they could have called her Dinosaur for all I care but this is one name that should be off limits or adjusted, they even have the same surname as they have the same father...Something about it just felt malicious and deliberate as if she's trying to replace my daughter and for them both to spring it on us like that at the first meeting? no that was weird.",

I\u2019ve been doing this since I was 25 so I\u2019ve got a decent idea of what I can and cannot do. And focusing on work only for 1-2 months is a sacrifice I\u2019m willing to make for chill rest of the year. This year, I\u2019ve moved in with my boyfriend (m35). Well, technically he moved in with me because i own the house so it was a no brainier for him to move in with me. We split chores half and half. He works full time (37.5 hours a week). When he moved in, I had a talk with him letting him know that I can\u2019t do any chores in November/December and asked if he could pick up the slack because I\u2019m physically unable to do any chores as I can be working anything  between 12-18 hours a day (I take a full January off to decompress). He said he doubted I worked that much but we will see. I asked again in September and October to make sure he was aware that I won\u2019t be doing anything (I meal prepped in advance) and I felt he kind of dismissed me.Mid November, we had an argument about my chores not being done and I reminded him of what I told him. He said that he thought I wasn\u2019t being serious and told me there\u2019s no way he\u2019d do 100% of chores because he\u2019s working too. I said fine, don\u2019t do my chores, they can wait until I have time. That\u2019s how it was when I lived alone, no problem, I don\u2019t make much mess anyway. He wasn\u2019t happy but dropped it. We haven\u2019t seen each other much because I\u2019ve been working so much but he\u2019s been more and more pissed off and blew up at me today regarding the chores. He said I had to have a better work life balance and to grow up because the house was a mess. I told him if it was a mess it was his fault because I barely leave my office. He called me a lazy bitch. I told him k didn\u2019t have time for arguing and went back working. He stood in front of my locked office door shouting how he couldn\u2019t believe I was bei mg serious about not doing chores and it was an asshole move to leave it all to him. He thinks I\u2019m a major asshole for basically disappearing for 2 months and following through with not doing chores.  Am I really the asshole for saying I won\u2019t do chores and following through? Sorry for any typos, I\u2019m on mobile and my autocorrect hates me.",

I made myself comfortable and set up my tablet. An hour or two into watching, the woman two rows behind me tipped on my shoulder and told me that I need to turn it off immediately. A little bit confused, I asked why. She told me that her young son could see the show playing on my tablet and it's totally not suited for such young children because of the sex and violence involved in it. While I agree with that, I told her that I'm not going to turn it off. She then basically told me that I am an asshole for not considering other people around me. Is she right?  Edit: I want to clarify a few things that were mentioned in the comments: - I was wearing headphones all the time. - It was a flight with Swiss from Europe to a city in the United States. The in-flight entertainment system offered various movies and tv shows that were also not suited for children. However I have to admit that probably none was as bad as GoT. However, none of these shows was censored as far as I can tell. - I'm not sure exactly where (aisle, middle or window) the kid was sitting since it was behind me and I think they switched seats frequently.",

We're still getting to know each other and the things we love vs hate. So for the past couple of weeks he's been sending me pics of his car that has been sitting in the mechanic (his cousin's) shop for weeks. He went on and on about what needs fixing and made a long list and calculated the total then sent it to me as a screenshot. I looked at it wondering what is have to do with me? He told me about his financial hardship atm and asked if I could help pay for his car to get it fixed quickly, so he'll be able to take me on that roadtrip he promised. I felt uncomfortable bc the money he was talking about was around 2.5k and I don't have that kind of money on my hand. He brought up my college fund and suggested I skip one semester so I could pay for the car. I was shocked he brought that up, idk he knows how important college is for me but he assured me he'll pay me back on time and that I only have to skip one semester and that's it. I asked for time to think about it but after he kept calling I decided to just give a polite NO. He asked why and I told him it's because my education is my priority and I can't handle skipping a semster, even if it's one. He hung up saying he needed time then texted me saying that I did not show support after he made himself open and vulnerable, and that I chose money over him by refusing to lend it to him, and that he is struggling and in need and that didn't matter to me. I felt really guilty and I started calling him but he texted me saying that he might respond when I make room for a compromise. AITA for refusing to pay?

        "selftext": " I M34 got married to my wife Claire 2 years ago, She has a 6 year daughter (my stepdaughter) that she shares custody of with her ex husband Adam. So Adam has not dated anyone eversince he and Claire got separated, Claire always talked about how this was a good thing because she believes that my stepdaughter is better off without a witch stepmom to boss her around and abuse her. Then, Adam started seeing his now girlfriend about 8 months ago, Claire wasn't happy about it-in fact- she was livid that Adam introduced my stepdaughter to his girlfriend so soon. Claire demanded meetings with Adam's girlfriend to test and see what kind of stepmom she will be for my stepdaughter, I didn't give it much attention because of the drama and always having MIL involved as well. However, I very recently found out that Claire installed several cameras in Adam's house while he and his girlfriend were away on a trip, Claire had the key to Adam's house because most of my stepdaughter's stuff is there. Keep in mind that I found out by looking at the chat Claire had with MIL so she was in on it too, It irked me because that is a total breach of privacy but when I confronted Claire she said she did this because Adam's girlfriend was going to move in soon and she wanted to see how she treats my stepdaughter, I told her this was wrong but she said it was all temporary til Adam's girlfriend is in the clear. I still wasn't convinced and suggested she remove the cameras because of the huge legal troubles once Adam finds out but she lost her temper on me saying I should stay out of it because I clearly don't care about my stepdaughter's wellbeing and happiness, but she had no evidence or even reason to believe Adam's girlfriend might mistreat my stepdaughter. Claire said she just wants to double check and Adam does not need to know. But I disagreed and said that I will tell him if she won't remove the cameras which made her lose it on me and get MIL to shut me down and get me to stay in my lane but I couldn't. Claire said if I tell Adam then we gonna have a problem and urged me to mind my own business because Adam isn't more important than my relationship with her so I shouldn't even entertain the idea of telling him and upsetting claire who is just trying to make sure her daughter's future stepmom isn't some witch stepmom in the making. I still want to tell him but given Claire's reaction, I'm going to get hell for this and it may not be worth it since me and Adam aren't on good terms.  EDIT: I've decided to tell him...there is no way this is going to end well for Claire nomatter how hard she tries to downplay the situation. Yeah I'm a coward but that is her opinion. I told her that I was not going to get caught in the middle of this whirlpool but she insisted I was the one trying to get involved, still ignoring how messed up her actions were. She can go ahead and turn every argument into a screaming match where I'm the one to blame but I'm getting sick of it.",

        "selftext": "This might seem silly. I (24F) like wearing cheerful socks, since my uniform is all white (currently working as an phlebotomist), it usually cheers up the patients too.  I've spent a few years collecting strange socks, ones with sushi, pizza, corgis, cats, Nick Cage, etc. I think I had about 30 pairs. My boyfriend (29M) has always hated them, and thinks they're childish. So I agreed to only wear them to work, and never on dates or around his friends/family. I thought that was fair.  On boxing day his parents came over for coffee and gifts (just the 4 of us, which is allowed where I live, and keeping a solid 3 meters apart). I accidentally put on a pair of 'childish' socks, and his mother made a comment about it. I explained that I wear them to work to cheer people up, and she liked that. My boyfriend didn't.  The next day all my socks were gone, and the drawer was filled with plain black socks. I asked my boyfriend, and he told me he threw them away and purchased some more 'appropriate' socks, so I won't embarrass him in front of his parents again.  I told him that that's insane, they were mine and he had no right to throw them away. Not to mention that I spend quite some time collecting them.  So I made a list of the ones I remembered I had, and told him that I expect the same ones as a replacement. He told me that's completely unreasonable, and that it would take a lot of time/effort/money for him to find those specific pairs. I haven't changed my mind yet, they cost me a lot of time and effort to find too.  I think he's being controlling, he thinks I'm being unreasonable and demanding.  AITA? I think I might be an asshole for asking for the exact same pairs, I know that'll take a lot of effort to find. Edit: Thanks everyone for replying, I've realised that this might not be a 'normal' fight and am evaluating the relationship.",

I was thrilled and excited to be included, but then she informed me that the dress code for the bridal party was gender-specific, with women expected to wear dresses and men expected to wear suits. As someone who identifies as non-binary and is more masculine presenting, I am uncomfortable with conforming to a gender binary that doesn't accurately represent me. I brought this up with my brother and his fianc\u00e9, but they insisted that they wanted all their guests to adhere to the dress code, regardless of how it made them feel. I ultimately decided that I did not want to attend the wedding, as I did not feel comfortable being pressured to conform to a gender binary that doesn't accurately represent me. My brother and his fianc\u00e9 are now upset with me, accusing me of being difficult and not willing to compromise. After a fight with them, I found out they went behind my back and involved my mom. She called me yesterday and told me I can put aside my identity for one day to make the day special for my little brother.  I now feel bad and didn't realize something as small as the clothes I feel comfortable wearing would cause a rift within my family.  So AITA for refusing to go to the wedding?",

At night we were all mingling and talking about each other and one of the american guys, upon hearing I was German, told me ohh a fellow German!. At this point I wasn't actually sure if he was american, so I asked in German if he was german. He mumbled a bit and said haha sorry I'm German but I actually don't speak the language, only a few sentences But he kept bringing up about how being german shaped his life, how important german culture was, like he apparently celebrates Oktoberfest every year and so.  I asked why did he say he was german if he was actually american, he said that it was because his great grandfather was german and his grandmother was german-irish...okay, whatever that means, I asked him if he knew where his great grandad was from and surprisingly he did, Hamburg! But this was extra hilarious because then it makes no sense for the guy to celebrate Oktoberfest, as that's a Bavarian thing (ja ja nowadays you can find Oktoberfest in any major german city but its not tradition, only commercial) I still didn't say anything and we just kept talking. The guy kept making all these remarks about German culture and German food like hot dog with Sauerkraut (???). Me and my friends were then planning to go look for a place to drink and he asked to come with us so the germans should stick together. We had a few beers at a bar and he ONCE AGAIN brought up something about being german and saying he was gonna get the german flag tattoed in Germany, by this point I was already a bit tipsy and annoyed and I told him can you please stop saying that? You're not german my friend, you're american of german descent, you don't even know about german culture or food, or how to speak, you're really annoying me The guy looked pretty angry/annoyed and kind of scoffed and tried to jokingly say you're right, I rather be american, at least then I can say I didn't lose a world war. At that point me and my friends were rolling our eyes so hard that we just moved to a different place. Later some other guy not related to us told me that the guy was pretty annoyed/sad that I told him he wasn't german because apparently that was a big part of his identity.

I get it. It's a nice idea to help people out. I have no problem and have participated sometimes in the past. Last week a meal train was posted for a lady named Sue (name changed obviously) who apparently had spent a few days in the hospital due to severe back pain. She's home now but still in pain and unable to do much. The meal signup stated about bringing a meal for 3 people. Sue lives with her husband and adult son. The husband and son work full time. Sue does not work. I decided not to sign up for this meal train because I also work full time. I figured if people want to, that's fine, but I don't have extra time to be cooking meals for people who have capable adults in the household to help out. Some people do have extra time, and that's great if they want to help out. Well, I'm guessing others felt this way too because the meal train just wasn't filling up very fast so they kept posting about it and posting about it. I kept ignoring it. Last night I got a call from a friend of Sue's. We'll call her Jane. Jane asked if I was aware that Sue had been in the hospital and if I could possibly sign up for a meal slot. I explained very nicely to Jane that I work full time and I don't often have time to make a full meal and that my husband and I usually just get our own meals or one of us cooks when we're able. She was like, Oh well that's ok. There are plenty of weekend slots availble too that you could sign up for when you're not working. I said, Well, aren't her husband and son home on the weekends? Couldn't they cook then? Jane got really snippy with me then and cut the conversation short. I told my husband about it and he thinks that I could have made time on the weekend to cook something and take it over just to be nice. I asked him why didn't he sign up then if he thought the needed meals on the weekend and he told me I was just trying to start an argument. I don't think I'm the AH because Sue's husband and grown son should be perfectly capable of cooking for Sue and themselves, especially on the weekend. But I might be the AH because I don't have much going on during the weekends and I COULD cook for them. I just don't see the need to. So.........reddit.......AITA?",

        "selftext": "Recently my father and I got into a huge political disagreement. We've always disagreed about some topics but over the years he's gotten worse. I (20 F) and my dad (45 M) have always talked about changes in the country or things that scare us. We used to be able to have a normal Ish conversation about these topics which include women's health or gay rights, but he's gotten increasingly more hostile about the conversation topics. A few months ago, I stopped talking to him for a few weeks because of it. It was really hard for me because the conversation ended with him saying cruel things to me. Such as... you need a man to get preg. Can't elaborate more but I'm sure you get what he said. For more context, I'm gay and engaged to a woman. We've been engaged for about 6 months now and were planning on wait till she was finished with school. Now we're both scared with the current circumstances that we won't have that chance. Though nothing is for certain of course, nothing is impossible. With the recent TikTok ban, which everyone has entitled opinions about, I tried to have a conversation with my dad about this and he turned into a screaming a-hole. It was an hour-long conversation which I did my best to be respectful, but he started to make comments about my age claiming that my opinions didn't matter because of that. Anytime I tried to speak he cut me off to yell at me. I can't go to in depth with our political beliefs because it is against guidelines, but he is red, and I am neither or. I can't agree with much of anything on the red or blue side because of my beliefs and things I've done for my own personal research.  After about an hour of him yelling and screaming at me, I finally put my foot down and told him, If you continue to yell at me, I will hang up this call and we can go a few months without speaking. This is my boundary, and you need to respect it. I never want to talk about these things with you because we obviously can't come to a mutual agreement- he cut me off to continue screaming at me and calling me a child.  I hung up and blocked him on everything. I felt so guilty for it. Now my fianc\u00e9 and I have our wedding planned in March. It's been a couple weeks since my father and I have spoken but he wanted to be there and make the rings for us as well. I feel extremely conflicted because my mom is performing the ceremony for us. She has her opinion about the situation and seems to think it's a good idea if he's not there. I've made jokes about it in passing but it's making me feel so sick to my stomach. This is my first wedding and the first relationship that has been healthy for me. Both of my parents love her, and I wanted to have everyone there. Now I don't know what to do. I'm scared my mom's side of the family will disagree with me and say that I'm wrong for inviting him, but I'm scared that I will feel guilty for the rest of my life for not trying to fix things with him so he can be there.

I was kind of caught off-guard and i said no, and he told me i needed to 'get on that'. i struggle to tell with him what's a suggestion vs what's a demand/if i don't do it I'll be in trouble, and getting in trouble is very stressful for me for some context: my parents divorced when i was little and have 50/50 custody. both remarried a few years after. mom set firm boundaries with how her and my stepdad parent me, she sees it as her job to parent me and he can be the fun stepdad but he doesn't get to discipline me, that's her job dad took a different approach, and let stepmom do a lot of parenting of me when i was young. we did not have the best relationship in the past , but it's better now, enough to where we can spend time together sometimes and i don't really mind her. she's nice and i appreciate all she does but she's not really a parent to me.   i asked my mom when i next saw her, and she said she doesn't want anything. i might make something as a thank you for her (she always gets me candy and trinkets for valentines since i don't really get valentines otherwise) and maybe i'll grab some candy for my brother since he's a kid (still in elementary) but i've never gotten either of them gifts for valentines before and it's never been an issue, and i dunno if doing that now will cause issues so maybe I'll just get something for little bro im not sure how relevant it is, but i do have suspected autism (multiple professionals we saw highly suspected it and recommended testing)but i haven't been able to get the assessment yet so no official diagnosis.   i only mention this because I'm not always the best with social situations, so it's not unheard of to be told I was rude on accident/am not doing something the way it's supposed to be done. but at the same time, I feel like it would've come up sooner if it was something expected of me? I'm not sure, I don't want to be rude at all I'm mostly just confused i dunno what dad will say if i don't get her anything, i don't want it to be a big deal really i just think it's kind of odd, but now I'm thinking about just getting her something small to avoid any fights. valentines day is approaching fast and I'm kinda nervous about it   so, WIBTA if i don't get her anything ? I'm genuinely not sure anymore. my friends i asked said it's fine but most of my friends don't really like my dad (and are also MY friends so ofc they'd side with me..) so I'd like an unbiased opinion on this. thanks for the help",

Recently we\u2019ve been having some little problems here and there but nothing major.  This weekend, I am going to an event with him and some friends. Some of the female friends attending the event will be spending the night at my house the night of the event. My boyfriend had decided to stay the night with one of his friends as a result of this.  We had loosely discussed doing something together on Saturday after the event we are attending tomorrow. I expressed to him on the phone that I wanted to stay home instead of seeing him because i\u2019ve been backed up with school and work. We both have part time jobs and live 45 minutes away, so sometimes it\u2019s not a fun commute from one place to another.  He began to get very irritated with me because i was ultimately cancelling on him but still seeing my friends the same weekend. When i explained to him that i don\u2019t see these friends very often and it was the day before our event and i couldn\u2019t just cancel the plans he became even more upset towards me. He then hung up and continued to bug me about seeing him. I told him i felt as though he was being very inconsiderate and selfish, he has not talked to me since. I can very clearly see why he would be upset because i\u2019m cancelling our plans but i don\u2019t see why he thinks im being so rude for being tired and or stressed.

        "selftext": "I have a close friend who is going through a very low point in their life. We communicate often and have always been there for each other during tough times. Our relationship is built on open and honest conversations, and I don\u2019t have that kind of connection with many people\u2014even family. I\u2019ve known this friend for years, and they\u2019re a genuinely good person. That being said, they recently made a very damaging mistake, and it has consumed their life. While things have improved slightly over the past few weeks, they\u2019re still far from moving on. I\u2019ve been by their side from the beginning, supporting them when no one else would. They truly appreciate it, but at this point, I just can\u2019t take it anymore. Today, I genuinely wanted to tell them to stop talking about their mistake. It\u2019s all they think about\u201424/7. I don\u2019t want to abandon them or make them feel worse, but I\u2019m exhausted. Even though their situation was critical at first, things have settled somewhat, yet they still bring it up constantly. I\u2019ve tried shifting the conversation, suggesting we hang out and have fun, making small talk, and even recommending professional help, but they reject every attempt or fail to take the hint. I know it might sound selfish to just want to talk about video games, sports, or anything else, but no matter what, they always redirect the conversation back to their mistake. I\u2019m not a therapist, and I\u2019m tired of hearing about a problem I can\u2019t solve. Would I be the asshole for telling them that they need to work through this on their own and that I don\u2019t want to talk about it anymore? ",

        "selftext": "Background - on a flight a few weeks ago, I was seated towards the middle of the plane, behind a very nice family. A mom traveling with her two kids. One was a baby, probably under 3 and the other was a 6 year old. Our flight had been delayed a few times while we were seated on the tarmac, the kids were getting a little restless & a young-ish woman across from them entertained them until we took off. When we got to our destination, it was around an hour or two later than the anticipated arrival time & very early in the morning (1-3 am, can\u2019t recall the exact time). Naturally, people were complaining about missing/making connected flights. The woman who had been helping the family took it upon herself to block the entire aisle until that family had gotten out of their seats and de-planed. Obviously chaos ensued. Some people *mouthed* off to the lady telling her to let them go through, people were questioning what was \u201cholding up the line\u201d among other comments. I overheard the mom (quietly) tell to the lady telling her she didn\u2019t want her to hold the line up & that they were in no hurry to get off. They were sitting down. She also said they normally waited to de-board, as it was easier with the baby. I took it upon myself to politely ask the woman if the rest of us behind her could go since the mom had said she didn\u2019t mind waiting. She turned around and *yelled* at me saying I didn\u2019t know what the mom wanted because I hadn\u2019t bonded (?) with them on the flight, and that a mom would never ask someone to hold up a line but that they\u2019d appreciate it internally, because moms are never respected by the public? I was so shocked I didn\u2019t know what to say because I\u2019d thought I was being polite & had overheard the mom saying it was fine to let everyone else go first. I just wanna know AITA in this situation? I feel like I\u2019m not but that woman yelling at me sure made me feel like I was. Edit: The mom and her kids did eventually get off but it was so awkward because the mom had clearly been prepared to wait, and all of a sudden had to get all of her stuff together and get off the plane, because of what this lady was doing for her. I feel like in that situation it would\u2019ve just been better for the lady to drop the Good Samaritan act because it was doing more harm than good?",

I'll refer to them as coworker A and coworker B. These two so happen to be roommates, btw. I am always hearing about their living conflicts at work and I get it; living with people is hard and I listen from a place of non-judgement. However, I feel as though I get put in situations where if I please one, I displease the other. I like both of them and I'm not a people pleaser, but its not like I want people to think poorly of me, either. Yesterday coworker A took B's drink from the fridge. Today B asked me who took the drink, and I was completely honest. I said A took it. This begun a conflict between them and I'm sitting there red in the face because I told the truth and all I could muster was an apology for even saying something. Clearly it isn't a world ending conflict, it just ended with B thanking me for saying something and A going back to her office.  I would never yap about something I KNOW I shouldn't. When either of them vent to me it is completely confidential-- but when I get put into a situation like this one I tend to just be honest instinctively. I hate being put in situations like this because I am displeasing one or the other, and I don't really know what else to do except be honest. I'm afraid I look like a 'squeaker' now... and maybe this does make me one. I can't help but to feel bad about this situation. I'm afraid I come off as an untrustworthy or loose-lipped. Personally, if someone took my drink I wouldn't really care but I'd be curious as to who it was. Coworker A even bought me lunch today :( So, Reddit... did I do coworker A dirty?  ",

I have a job, I pay my bills, I put in for the rent, and I try my best to be responsible.  I also want to put it out there that I am in a family who uses Life360, as a way of \u201csecurity to make sure we\u2019re doing alright.\u201d But I know damn well that it makes it difficult for me to be free and go places without people knowing.  So I decide to treat myself to a tattoo, because I feel like I deserve it after all the hard work I put in at my job. It makes me happy, and I want it to get through the mental turmoil I am getting from what is going on in the world.  However, I still feel like I need to tell my parents what I am doing. This is something I SHOULDN\u2019T be doing because I am an adult. They don\u2019t need to know if and/or when I am getting a tattoo. If it was me, I\u2019d turn Life360 off. It\u2019s so much that it has become a heavy weight on me that I can\u2019t get off until I tell my parents. And so I did.  I told them straight up that I already made the appointment, placed the deposit, and financed it. I have been met with my mother crying again. With previous tattoos she asks me why I am investing so much. Now she asks me \u201cwhat is going on in your head??\u201d It felt like she was asking \u201cwhat is wrong with you\u201d for wanting my arms covered. She didn\u2019t talk to me for the rest of the day.  My dad then comes and then asks me to \u201creconsider the date and push it further because that way my mother won\u2019t feel bad anymore\u201d This comment triggered me because it comes off that I can\u2019t do something for ME to be stable and happy, but I have to fold for others to make THEM stable and happy. Or that my decisions and choices are too much when already I am doing stuff and even more at my job.  So I am struggling to confidently say that I will proceed with my appointment because there is that lingering guilt of hurting my parents. But I in good faith cannot bend my arm to please others because I am doing that every day. For making that decision and \u201crebelling\u201d against them, AITA?",

        "selftext": "For context, I am 14 M, my mom is in her 30's. Now i wouldn't usually post or do anything on Reddit but i feel like this is the best way to see if I'm in the wrong here. I recently found out from a cousin that they believe I'm failing my classes which isn't the case, last semester, which I thought they were talking about at first, I had good grades but I missed a lot of days. I mean A Lot, which I would've understood if they thought that.  I don't tell these cousins or any of my aunts or other family members about my school life because I believe that it's mine and my mother's business, I did send a text to ask her, But despite me trying my best to remain calm and respectful in my message, but she didn\u2019t like it, not major but I still feel like it's kinda unfair, in the message I basically said, 'hey I know we had some rough times recently, but i didn't think that it was that bad, I would appreciate it if you could stop telling people about my school life/education without asking me/getting permission if I'm okay with it, hope you can see where I'm coming from' me and my mom haven't had the best relationship since an argument a few weeks ago about her waking me up for school, but ever since that, things have been tense in the house, l've been trying to be more calm, less argumentative, just better in general because, im getting older now right? It's better to be mature than immature right? Now my mom was raised in a men do the work household, so she I think believes that we shouldn\u2019t complain since it was harder for them when she was a kid. here's an example, last week, we watched a movie in our home, during movies it's sometimes just hard to hear especially at home when everyone just talks all the time, l asked my brother and my mom if they could quiet down during the movie, my mother tells me, (not word for word) if I don't like them talking I can get up and go to my room. I didn't feel like fighting her on something so simple, like being quiet during a movie so I got up took my food (was eating) and started walking to my room , she seemed surprised, most likely because i usually just let it go, and asked me 'are you really gonna go into your room?' I responded \u2018yeah, you said go into my room if i have a problem with it.\u2019 Now I'm socially tone deaf so I tried to keep my voice calm and respectful but I don't know if I raised my voice or not. We had a whole argument over that.  At some point I said it was just a personal pet peeve, which (correct me if I'm wrong) I believe means you really dislike that specific thing, or it just really bothers you, which in this case, I do indeed have one. Then i just stopped talking, i was originally gonna agree and come back out, but she kept interrupting me before i could reach that conclusion, which was when i decided to shut my mouth, I just need to know if I\u2019m in the wrong here, maybe im being a bratty kid here but i feel like each time i try to ask for something to stop, it turns into an argument.AITA?",

I'm not from the US and English is not my first language so apologies for mistakes I work for a large company (think on the scale of Google/Microsoft) who hire many new recent university graduates every year. We have a group chat, regularly meet up as a big group and are all friendly with each other. Now of this group, I only knew one girl, lets call her Amy, prior to being hired as we went to university together and even though we have very different interests, have stayed very good friends. About 3 months ago, I decided to start a book club and put a message in the larger chat asking if people wanted to join. About 5 people joined my group (Amy was not one of them) and we started book club, we've read 3 books so far and meet once a month.  Upon choosing our latest book, a historical fiction novel, one of the members of the club had a really good idea, that we should visit the location the book is based on and do a historical tour, visit museums and heritage sites and link it to our discussion. We all thought this was a really good idea and have planned out the whole trip, including bookings and tickets, we leave in 3 weeks Amy found out about the trip and is really hurt I didn't invite her, she says a holiday sounds fun and she is close to the other girls in the book club and Amy feels excluded because she won't be a part of this trip. She says that fact that I planned this all behind her back is very 'snakey' and she wouldn't have excluded me like that. She mentioned how fun the nightlife is, bars etc and how it's going to look weird that we are all on holiday without her. Now we wouldn't be interested in doing any of this things, some of the members of the club don't drink, and we were honestly just going for museums, and to tie into the book we were reading. Unfortunately we've already booked everything and we really don't have the availability to add another person, furthermore, I did just want a chill book-ish trip, not a 'girls trip'.  Amy has became really upset and accused me of alienating her from her friends and I'm actually feeling very guilty now, and wondering if I'm just being stubborn and whether I should have told her about the trip from the beginning, and maybe she could have read the book and joined us, but as Amy doesn't like reading and hasn't been a member of the club, I didn't think she would be interested. But i can see how she feels alienated and I do feel guilty, AITA? ",

        "selftext": "Hi, so today I (16F) was working on some English homework in my room when my mom (46F) came in. For some context, my family is Muslim, and my mother is extremely religious to a point the rest of us are not. Regardless, I still complete the five daily prayers every day to avoid her getting mad at me, because if I stop, it could result in her pulling me out of school and trying to marry me off, as she's threatened to do. My mom is known among my sister, my father, and I to be narcissistic and emotionally immature, but she refuses to get help or accept that she has a problem. We just put up with her behavior all the time, but sometimes I snap a bit. My mom was telling me that I need to complete the night prayers right after we eat dinner so she can watch me pray and see that I'm actually doing it. I responded that I do pray but I do it before I go to sleep because I'm usually right in the middle of something before dinner and want to finish it up. She began saying that she doesn't hear me get out of bed to pray at night and she doesn't believe that I actually do it. I told her I'm not sure why she doesn't hear me because I do get up and pray, but she kept accusing me of lying. I was in the middle of trying to finish this assignment and I was frustrated that she was making it *my* problem that *she* can't hear me. I asked her if she wants me to be louder or something and she said No, I just want you to tell me why I can't hear you, and I want you to actually pray. I got fed up and here's where I may be TA. I told her (politely but firmly) that I was done with this conversation because it wasn't going anywhere and asked if she could leave me alone so I could work. She kept nagging me to answer her question and told me I can't ask her to leave whenever I feel like it, and I responded by telling her that I already answered her question and she was distracting me and there was no point in continuing the conversation when she wasn't listening to me. I then reminded her that she does this all the time, comes in my room and starts accusing me of things and doesn't listen to my side of the argument, & why should we have more conversations like this when we already know how it's going to go? She tearfully told me that if I don't want her in my room she'll leave, and I politely responded, Oh, okay, you can leave then. She yelled, You don't want me in your room? Fine, write it down then. This is the last time I'm ever stepping foot in your room. She proceeded to slam the door extremely hard and hasn't spoken to me since. It's true that I was annoyed with my mom for accusing me of lying and repeating the same things over and over again. I feel like her slamming the door so hard and having that reaction to a pretty reasonable request was a bit of an overreaction, but I'm worried asking her to leave me alone was too harsh. However, I didn't say anything in a rude or yelling tone, I tried my best to maintain my composure and say everything calmly. AITA? ",

        "selftext": "My partner Kyle (27M) and I (26F) spent a few days at his mother's Mary (50F? thereabouts) in January. Mary is what people call a character. She has no understanding of boundaries, overshares, can be very rude... The type that picks a vegan restaurant then complains to the waitress that they don't have bacon & eggs. Kyle wants to have a good relationship with her but it's hard. I'm polite with Mary but spending time with her is difficult. I actually suggested the trip because she regularly complains that Kyle spends more time with his father than with her, and I know it makes him feel bad. One evening towards the end of the trip, we were all sitting together watching TV and the conversation drifted to Kyle's father, John. John is a generally good guy, and both Kyle and I have a good relationship with him. Mary & him were never together as a couple. Mary started saying mean things about Kyle's father, then suddenly went off about him, telling us how he's a terrible person and now he's got a cushy little life because of all the money from the settlement. Kyle's father is a victim of malpractice, he went in for a routine operation and ended up heavily handicapped. He almost died & had to stop working. He sued and got money from the hospital. I got angry and told her to stop this type of talk and that considering he almost died and was handicapped for life, it was hardly cushy. She told me she could say whatever she liked and that he'd made her life hard back in the days so she could be mean now. I answered I didn't have to stay and listen to this type of shit and left for bed. Afterwards Kyle told me he hadn't said anything because he was so used to it but he was happy I'd told her to stop. The next day she didn't talk about the argument. Three weeks after we left, Kyle called her to get some news. She told him that we had hurt her when we were are her place, and that she found my attitude disrespectful and mean. I feel kind of insane right now so: am I the asshole?",

        "selftext": "My boyfriend (M43) and I (F46) have lived together for over a year.  Because I worked remotely, most of the house work would fall on me because I didn\u2019t have a commute.  I have been telling him for months I need help around here, especially since I feel like he creates more work for me (he can be a slob) and I feel unappreciated.  His response is to tell me that if I want him to do something, all I need to do is ask.  I feel that he lives here and can see when things need to be cleaned, he shouldn\u2019t wait to be asked. He claims he doesn\u2019t always \u201csee\u201d the mess the way I do. Recently I asked him to fix a few things around the house that are still not done.  These aren\u2019t especially difficult tasks, but he said he\u2019d do them a month ago.  This tends to be a reoccurring theme that when I do ask, if it doesn\u2019t get done I end up doing things myself, then he gets mad about my attitude. Fast forward to today, I\u2019m doing laundry.  My laundry, and the towels, sheets, dog blankets.  Despite the fact that I know clothes he\u2019ll want for tomorrow and the weekend are in there, I\u2019m not doing his laundry like I normally would.  I think I\u2019m just not going to \u201csee it\u201d.  I also know he\u2019s getting home late from work tonight and probably won\u2019t have time to do it himself before bed.  I know it\u2019s petty, but will it make me TA?",

        "selftext": " I (24F) have a best friend (23F) that has been really weird for some time. I got a boyfriend (24M - 2Y together) a few months after she got one herself, and since she's been SO weird about it.After a while I realized she was jealous; she told me he would steal me from her and would roll her eyes everytime I mention him, to the point where she would mock me to the friends we were with (oh, everything's about him \u2013 my friends were always like what? whatever and never paid much mind). I SWEAR I don't make ANY thing about him, I just mention him as he is part of my life and recently moved in with me. I have never ONCE complained or said anything bad about her boyfriend, and yet she makes an effort to complain about mine. It's always been like this, but recently it's gotten worse.Every time I ask if something's wrong, she just shrugs me off, saying everything's fine. I once had a heart to heart with her because I felt she was distancing herself from me; she said I was distancing myself from her and I wasn't even on social media as much as I used to be. I was in my final year of college, on top of working a full time job. I didn\u2019t have time to be on social media as much as before because I DIDN'T HAVE TIME. We finished the talk on good terms but she keeps being weird with me, distancing herself and making weird remarks about my boyfriend. Recently we all went out and she told him she's better when her suggestion for MY DRINK was favored instead of my boyfriend's. Afterwards, I couldn't take it anymore and asked her privately what I had done to her. She shrugged me off again, but I insisted. Why was she acting weird towards my boyfriend for so long and distancing herself from me? Did I do anything? When she said I spent all my time with him, I told her that no, he LIVES with me and everytime I asked her to go out for a drink/a meal with me/our friend group (without my bf) she refused. I'm not distancing myself from her; she's distancing herself from me. I told her she was so scared of me distancing myself from her that she did it first. She got mad at me and said that my boyfriend was taking up all my time, and she was not to blame. I got mad as well and told her You know what? Grow up. You're being JEALOUS, and you're not acting like a 23 year old about it. How come you spend time with your boyfriend and I've never said anything about it, but when I spend time with mine you have so much to say? Grow up. I can have a love life as much as you can.. She didn't budge, and so I left. Am I the asshole for telling her to grow up over her jealousy over my boyfriend? I'm literally so done with this. She set up a self-fulfilling prophecy that I was going to abandon her and she's doing it herself. And after all, her remarks about my boyfriend really hurt me because he hasn't done anything to deserve her anger (they barely talk. she doesn't let him talk and he has since given up on trying to win her over).I really miss my best friend but she's acting unreasonable.",

I planed to do this on the weekend before half term, two weeks before I had asked my brother (m30) to help me film and he had said yes. A week before the filming date I confirmed with him again that he was available and he said yes. It is now a day before the weekend we are supposed to film and my brother has just said that he's going to his girlfriend's house for the weekend.  I remind him that he said he was free for filming this weekend but he asked if the date could be changed to next weekend. This doesn't work for me for multiple reasons, 1- we are getting a cat next weekend and where I plan to film is the room where the cat will be staying until it has settled in and I don't want to stress it out by moving its things around and forcing it to move (it's a relatively small room). 2- I want to enjoy my holiday after many stressful projects and spend time with the cat.  I think it's unfair that I have to change the date that I'm filming because he forgot, this isn't the first time he has forgotten something like this. My brother disagrees and is calling me a baby (I cry when I am angry and we had been arguing for a few minutes now) and that I can still spend time with the cat and film next weekend. I told him he didn't know what he was talking about as he wasn't the one to do research about the cat and how to introduce them slowly to the house, honestly he doesn't really care about it. We fought for quite a while (my mother was useless in defusing the situation) and it ended with us storing off into different rooms. Do what I want to know is if I'm the whole for refusing to change my filming date.",

        "selftext": "I have no clue how to start this so here we go, I am 27 years old, work seasonally at a beach club/music festival around the US as a bartender/server. When I was around 13-14 my aunt with two disabled children(who are now 21)asked if I would be willing to take a job with the agency she goes through for the children's benefits The deal she explained to me was she would put the hours in and collect the checks at the end of the week but come tax season I would make out great with taxes. unfortunately, at the time my mother was in the midst of her addiction and wasn't there to explain the consequences of what this could bring, at 13 I agreed to what my aunt was asking, not fully aware of what it meant. I tried filing the taxes probably three times with the w2s from both of the children and ended up owing or getting nothing back because I was working when she was claiming I worked for her as well. when I was 21, I demanded that she stop claiming wages in my name. she told me she had done so and stopped, again I owed on taxes. so, to my knowledge for the past 6 years she was not claiming wages in my name after I said stop like I said before my work is seasonal for the most part with bartending festivals and the beach club only being open summer-late fall, HR suggested to file unemployment since they had to push our reopen date back a month. when I applied for unemployment the woman, I was speaking to informed me that I had wages in another state from my aunt's children, my wages in all states will be looked at and sent to me for review that was three days ago. that paperwork came in two days ago it showed within the last year my aunt has claimed $61,568 in my name. I immediately contacted her through text (I have been refusing to speak on the phone in case I need messages documented) and begged to know why she didn't stop when I asked her 6 years ago to stop since those wages potentially made me ineligible for unemployment, I did find out today that I will be getting unemployment based off those wages as well. the woman I spoke to said I'd be getting more for unemployment because of those wages. Since she has been claiming that amount for that long in my name plus, I haven't filed the taxes because I had no idea that she was still doing it. she did say again she would stop but she didn't last time. My mother is freaking out on my aunt. my 80-year-old grandfather has called to see what is going on and I was honest with him but he's just trying to do damage control so no one will report my aunt. I don't want her to get arrested, but I cannot pay the taxes that are owed. she has reached out and told me to do the taxes and she will take care of them. but the point is she should have never kept going to begin with, I agreed and said I wouldn't be paying the taxes she would as soon as I find out how much they are, as well id appreciate financial help since she's been doing this to me for years.

        "selftext": "Hello! I have to give backstory so bear with me pls My mum (44f)and dad (44m) broke up when I was 3 years old and my brother was 6. At first for a couple weeks my dad didn\u2019t see us, until he met his new girlfriend and she made sure he started to see us, very soon into their relationship they announced they were having a baby together. We continued seeing them every Fortnight until my half brother was about one and that\u2019s when my dad and half brothers mum split up.  After that I don\u2019t remember much of my dad until I was around 7 which is when he met his 3rd gf. They had two kids together and got engaged but they broke up and dipped:/ from about 7-14 I think I saw my dad like 5 times \ud83c\udf1a Anyway I\u2019m now 17 and for about three years my dad has called every now and again, he normally asks how we are and makes small talk, he says hell call on birthdays (normally doesnt) there\u2019s so many reasons as to why he hasn\u2019t called (normally a medical issue or mental health) I don\u2019t know what\u2019s true and what\u2019s not and I\u2019ve tried to ask but he just shuts down.   When he would call he would also make sure that me and my brother and mum wouldn\u2019t tell my little brothers mums that he was speaking to us and he only ever called us on private number(I literally never understood why but it seemed shady) A few weeks ago I found out from my half brothers mum that he has another child, one he had never said anything about, me and my older brother were so shocked so when he next called we asked him about the baby. Pretending not to hear us would be an understatement \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d After not \u201chearing us\u201d he hung up. He\u2019s called about 7 times in the past three months and every single time we ask him we get no answer. My uncle is really nice and has his own little family, when we last spoke I told him about my dads kid, he was shocked, but that was about it, he knew nothing I think my dad finally wants to see my brother and me but I don\u2019t know if I even want to see him, I don\u2019t know him that well and I struggle with even speaking to him,but if I don\u2019t see him I feel guilty. He pretends like he never left, I\u2019ve never had a proper conversation with him about any of it because he only communicates on surface level. It lowk messes w me sometimes, some days I care and some days I literally don\u2019t see him as my dad and I feel guilty about that even though he left and made those decisions.

        "selftext": "So I got into Magic the Gathering about five months ago and have been hooked. I\u2019ve made some friends playing at my local game store, and I\u2019ve learned a lot. Every monday the store hosts a tournament- standard, $5 entry, 3 rounds, winner gets the pot in store credit. I\u2019ve made a few friends there who\u2019ve been playing every week just like me, let\u2019s call them Bob and Dan. Bob has met up with me to play casual matches and such, and we\u2019ve generally gotten along. Bob and Dan, however, are hardcore at this game- where I like to build my own decks, Bob plays tournament winning decks made by pros, and Dan puts every top performing meta card into his deck for a deck thats in total, to buy the singles, the cards cost about $400. (My decks on average cost about $45). They win almost every week- there\u2019s currently a Cowboy Bebop promo where if you win, you get a special cowboy bebop inspired standard card. I saw one of them talking about getting their fourth (of just that 2-month period\u2019s card). They also commented that they play every week with store credit, they never have to shell out $5 to play anymore.I\u2019m not bitter, but I want to win too. I\u2019d like to get one of those cards. And I make my decks with the hopes they\u2019ll be able to compete for it. And I don\u2019t like feeling like new players are just handing their money over to these guys. This week, I finally did it- I went 3-0 with a deck I made. My final match was against Dan, who was a little salty. He complained that I got lucky and that he wasn\u2019t drawing good cards, which does happen fairly often in this game. When i won our best of 3, i was excited because I\u2019d never gone 3-0 before, and I\u2019d really wanted to. I put my hands in the air and said \u201cI did it.\u201d (not loud) and explained that I\u2019d never won a tourney before, so I\u2019m happy to now. I was excited and found friends and told them I finally did it as well. Bob came over and said \u201cI haven\u2019t gone 1-2 in a while, it feels bad\u201d which I responded to with \u201cit doesn\u2019t feel good, does it?\u201d I was mainly just teasing, but to be honest, it feels a bit silly to complain about winning just one match when Bob goes 3-0 about half the weeks he plays. Also, usually, 1-2 or 2-1 is my how well I do. They both left, and I texted Bob after I left, but he hasn\u2019t responded in a few days. I feel bad about the comment I made and I wonder if I celebrated winning a bit too much for their tastes. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s my fault for gloating or if it\u2019s their fault for being egotistical about the game, or if I\u2019m overthinking all of this. Or maybe I care too much about the game. My life has been a little stagnant lately and that\u2019s my fault. TLDR: Celebrated winning a card game tournament, wonder if my behavior doing so is upsetting to others. Edit- I was indeed overthinking. Nobody\u2019s upset with me. I just in the past missed some social cues and have seemed to be good at making people not like me. So i was worried about this. Thanks for ur opinions!",

I bring things done from home and show them too my group, everyone doesn't seem to mind except one girl who attacks me (not physically) with every idea or comment I say... for example the other day we were talking about our time and I just commented that maybe we could all have a monologue each (JUST AS AN IDEA) and this girl laughed and said ohhh so 5min each talking without stopping I laughed it off and explained that I didn't mean that because it was too long for our play and that it could be 1min each something like that and immediately after our teacher came to check on us and this girl started laughing and laid she thinks it's okay to have 5min each of non stop talking almost wanting to humiliate me and my IDEAS... I know it doesn't sound like much but u still felt attack beacause it wasn't the first time she did something like that...Yesterday I realised that she had been saying to many people that I was leaving all the work for her and I felt SO hurt because I feel like I'm the one doing most of the work, at least more than her and because I'm new and I really want to cause a good impression and that ruins it I think...And now we are running out of time so I'm just writing the play at home as a backup just in case we don't finish...

        "selftext": "I have lived in a 5bedroom student housing unit with a shared kitchen for the last 3 years. When I moved in I brought a couple of things with me and also bought some new stuff (a dish rack, a really nice second-hand food processor, some plates and mugs and a several cake/bread tins). I have not kept the receipts for these things and never asked any of my roommates to reimburse me for anything but everything has been in the kitchen and available for anyone to use. I have also made sure not to throw away anything that I replaced so that I could take my things and put the old back when I eventually move out. However, the 4 other people who lived here when I moved in have since moved out and been replaced (the first about 2 years ago and the last 6 months ago). I will be moving out soon too and have therefor started to pack my stuff. After taking my things from the kitchen one of my roommates asked about it in our groupchat. I told the truth (that I have taken the things that are mine since I am moving) and several of my roommates got very upset. They either don't believe that the stuff is really mine or they think that it's silly of me to want to keep them since they are used and have been in the kitchen for long enough that they should belong to everyone. I don't want them to feel like I am stealing things but I don't really have any proof to give them. One of them tried to contact the roommate who recently moved out but they have not responded and I have no way to contact the other ex-roommates. So, AITA? Should I just leave everything? It isn't really about money since I'd say it's probably only $100 worth of stuff and I have a job whereas my roommates are all students, but I would like to keep my things. Are there any third options? Edit: Thank you to everyone who's commented, I think I might have just been stressed out bc of the move and overreacted to the situation. I feel much more secure in my decition to just take my stuff! To clarify something that's come up in several comments; there's a bunch of stuff in the kitchen that has been left by earlier tenents/might even have been put here by the student union that owns the place, so it isn't entierly clear if anything belongs to someone unless it's put in the very limited space (a singe shelf) that's been labled with our roomnumbers.",

I try to get him to read a book before he plays video games and or go outside to ride bikes with the neighborhood kids and he just throws a fit my mom is no help at all with teaching him the basics she just gets upset with how he acts in school because she let's him get away with any and everything growing up. I even offer to give him money in exchange  for reading and doing his class work but he just cries and cries until I don't want to do it anymore i get upset and yell at him but nothing mean or degrading i just explain why i want and NEED him to read. Im a little ruff with my brother somtimes but its only when he slaps or hops on my back hes heavy but not fat if that makes sense. I don't like him touching my stuff but that's not only specifically for him only that's for everyone because I feel like i lose things easily and i do get upset a bit and tell him to leave  my room when moving small but important things around. My mom says I'm being abusive when all I want is for him to learn so he isn't taken advantage of in the future and i dont want him to have to depend on my mom who seems like she doesn't  care , I started to want to give up because of what she says but this has been a thing since I was little she was never nice to me growing up so I just have gotten use to shutting off whenever I hear her starting to scream at me but it's annoying when she does it to my siblings. I hate hearing them cry when my mom does the same shit she did to me and then she goes off blaming us for her failed relationships and she goes on rants about how she didn't have to have us.",

My friend is getting married next summer, she asked me to be a bridesmaid in her wedding months ago and of course I said yes. Months go by and my friend is planning this wedding, she tells me a week ago that they have decided to get married in Italy. I was happy and excited for her obviously. We talked about the dates, accommodations and everything we needed for this wedding. I discovered that I could not afford to travel for this wedding I told her that I didn't have the money to travel to Italy and she immediately began screaming at me, telling me You agreed to be a part of this wedding so figure it out I explained to her that when we talked about her wedding before she got engaged it was going to be a small wedding in our hometown, now it has turned into something bigger that I just can't afford. She then told me Work more hours or even move back in with your parents so you don't have to pay rent and make it to this wedding. You already agreed to be in this wedding, you can't back out. All my other bridesmaids are coming so why can't you? I felt horrible for it but I told her I had to drop out of being in her wedding as it was expensive to travel, find accommodations, pay for my dress. All of it added up was too much for my budget. She hung up on me and about 10 minutes later her fianc\u00e9 called me and asked me why I was being a horrible friend. Her parents messaged me, along with the rest of her bridal party telling me that I shouldn't have backed out of this wedding and just found a way to get the money necessary for this wedding. I've been feeling like a bit of an asshole about it. So, AITA for dropping out of my friends wedding because I couldn't afford it?",

Some time ago, he confessed that he had feelings for me and i declined. I wasn't ready for a relationship because i worked 2 jobs at the time and barely had time for myself. After that he pestered me a lot about what was he missing and that i was playing the stereotypical 'girls don't want nice guys' agenda. He kept pushing me over and over and guilt tripped me over not giving him a 'proper reason'. I told him that i just didnt want a relationship at the time. I told him to give us some space for his comfort, but he didnt want that, so we didnt explicitly break our friendship, but i still distanced myself a bit. A week ago was his birthday, and i was getting my teeth removed, so very high on meds and i forgot it. I had a long wish written out, and a social media post in my drafts. It's not like i forgot his bday date, i just forgot what date it was in general. My mental clock was lagging badly.  I forgot to wish him on time, and when i realised it had already been a day, so i apologized multiple times, but he just gave me backhanded comments and saying how he didn't have any expectation. Then he said i didnt respect our friendship enough and continued saying how his new friends were way better than me.  I still feel guilty for forgetting his birthday but i also don't think i needed to be humiliated like that. So please be honest here, aita for this?",

        "selftext": "My gf (21f) and I (23M) live together and lately I've been getting a little frustrated with how we handle household chores. I do pretty much everything... all the time. I cook, clean, do dishes, get groceries, you name it. I don't mind doing more, because I genuinely enjoy doing something nice for a partner, but it hurts me that she doesn't reciprocate back. I could make dinner 7 nights in a row, and she'll say no if I ask her to cook us some pasta the next night. Anyways, we had a discussion regarding chores and I expressed my issues. I said I don't mind doing more, but I need something from her. We decided that she would handle sweeping and cleaning the litter boxes. Seems simple enough, but two weeks go by and she doesn't do either, ever. This upset me, so one night when I was heading out and she was staying home, I asked her if she could clean the house. I had a lot going on that day, and didn't get to the chores I normally would. She hesitantly said yes, and did, but the next day she expressed how she didn't feel it was right for me to put it all on her. She says that since I work remote, I have more time to do chores, therefore it should be my responsibility. I was speechless. I normally do nearly everything, every single day Her commute is about 15 minutes, and she works on computers all day, just like me. I get it, I have the privilege of being able to wash some dishes in between work activities, which is why I don't mind doing more, but AITA for not wanting to do everything? It's not like I have ample time before she gets home, many nights I'm still doing chores while she comes home and smokes weed. She even got mad because while I was doing the dishes to cook us dinner, I asked her to get the sponges from her car once she walked in from work. She said I could have texted before she walked in. Sure, but like, I'm about to spend nearly an hour doing stuff for us but you can't take 1 minute to get a sponge? Sorry im ranting a bit, but am I crazy?? **tl;dr**  **My gf said that I should do all the chores because I work remote**",

        "selftext": "Some background: I (29F) used to know Tom (30M) years ago. We were acquaintances as teenagers, and though we briefly dated at 16, it wasn\u2019t serious, and we stayed on neutral terms whenever we ran into each other. A few years later, when we were in our early twenties, I bumped into him at a nightclub, and he introduced me to his then-girlfriend, Alex. From the moment we met, Alex was noticeably cold toward me she barely spoke, made passive-aggressive comments about my appearance, and created an uncomfortable tension. Sensing the awkwardness, I made my exit. Tom later messaged me to apologize for how she acted, but I brushed it off. I didn\u2019t think much of it, as we weren\u2019t close anyway. Since then, I\u2019ve occasionally run into them at different social events, and Alex\u2019s attitude toward me has never changed. She has made snide remarks in passing, whispered about me to others while I was nearby, and has generally gone out of her way to be hostile anytime we\u2019re in the same space. I\u2019ve always ignored it because, as far as I was concerned, whatever problem she had with me wasn\u2019t my issue. Now to last weekend, I was out with some friends when I saw Alex and Tom at the same venue. Tom came over to say hello and make small talk, and almost immediately, Alex stormed over. Without even greeting me, she shoved her ring in my face and made a pointed comment about how I \u201cdefinitely couldn\u2019t have him now.\u201d I laughed and told her I never wanted him in the first place, but I was happy for them. That only made things worse. She started raising her voice, accusing me of trying to get attention for years, making assumptions about me, and throwing out personal insults. When she finally finished, I asked if she was done and told her that I had never done any of the things she was accusing me of. I also made it clear that I didn\u2019t care about her or Tom and, most importantly, that she needed to stop making her personal insecurities my problem. She looked like she was about to respond, so I added that she also needed to stop being jealous of me because there was no reason for it. At that point, she excused herself and left the room, with Tom following after her. Before he left, he told me I didn\u2019t need to say all that. My friends thought my response was blunt but justified, while some mutuals later told me I was too harsh and should have been more understanding because she\u2019s obviously insecure. Now, I\u2019m wondering was I too harsh?",

        "selftext": "I'm (31f) a head teacher at an academy in S.K. I taught here in 2021 & I've been back for 3 months. My 3 US coworkers all came last Aug. Unfortunately, the head teacher before me was a pushover and the other two women (Lucy 27, Cindy 23) asked that I be more assertive since John (late 30s/m) tends to steamroll everyone. In my presentation class we needed to talk about the rubric for their final projects so I needed them to really focus well. John teaches this group the hour before me. Previously he tried to bring very messy snacks to my Lit class. I asked him to please not take snacks to any teachers classes unless you've spoken to them about it. Today he made a bag of popcorn and started putting it in little bowls. Before I went to class I asked him you're not planning on bringing that to my class are you? And he replied with no I'm not. 10min in class the door opens, here he comes with popcorn and the kids go nuts. I tell them no and I follow John back to the door. I say I just asked you if you were bringing it to the class and you said no but you did it anyways. That's so disrespectful. It took a couple min to settle the kids but they didnt grumble about it after I said they can have the snack after class. Class is over, John is out in the hallway giving the kids popcorn and I go to the teachers office. I say to my coworker Lucy, I can't believe he still tried to bring them popcorn when I asked him if he was and he said no to which she responded and why can't they have a snack??. I said first of all, there are signs in all the classrooms that say no eating during class and second, I said no because I needed them to focus on lesson and that should be reason enough. When John came back in the office I asked to speak privately. I told him that it was disrespectful for him to bring snacks when I had already asked if he was and he had said no. His response was I told you no because that bag had gotten kind of burnt and I wanted to make more. I thought you were only asking if I was taking THAT bag of popcorn. I was lowkey floored? We talked 2 weeks ago about not bringing food to classes without asking first and why would I mean that one specific bag of popcorn? He started yelling about how he was just trying to do something nice. I explained to him that I understand that he is doing something kind for the students but he's also not the king of the academy and he can't come into classes in the middle of lesson without asking first. There was a little more back and forth but by the end he said he understood. Now I'm still thinking about it. It was literally just popcorn but it just feels like the principle of the matter? I feel like maybe ITA because I didn't directly say do not bring them snacks because I need to go over really important material at the start of class but usually we finish early so it's okay at the end of class. Lucy's reaction is also making me feel like I over did it.",

        "selftext": "I have a roommate who pays me about 90% of half the rent\u2014so if the total rent is $1,600, they contribute around $700. I cover the rest, along with water, gas, internet, and electricity, because I earn more than they do. When they first moved in, I felt sorry for them because they were leaving an abusive situation. It\u2019s been a little over a year since they moved into my guest room, and overall, it hasn\u2019t been too bad. However, when they moved in, I had some of my belongings in the closet\u2014primarily books. The room is fully furnished with my furniture, including a large bed that takes up a lot of space, a heavy bookshelf, and around 500 books stored in 5\u20136 boxes and two large bags. I always intended to go through them, pick out my favorites, and donate or sell the rest, but due to my ADHD and object impermanence, I kept pushing it off. In the long run, I envisioned turning the room into a closet/library after they moved out since I prefer having my clothes visible rather than stored away. Last year, I came home to find my bookshelf outside by the dumpsters. I immediately told my roommate to put it back in the room because they had no right to throw away my belongings. If they had asked, I would have found another place for it, but I was so frustrated that I insisted they return it to the room without offering an alternative solution. Fast forward to now: I recently hired someone to help clean my apartment when work gets too busy. They offered to organize my cabinets, which reminded me to finally sort through my books\u2014only to be told that my roommate had thrown them all away months ago. Over 500 books\u2014hardcover, paperback, large, small, books I had kept since middle school\u2014just gone. They never asked, never mentioned feeling uncomfortable with them in the closet, never gave me a chance to move them. They simply decided to discard decades of my history without my permission. I was so upset that I haven\u2019t spoken to them in over a week. It\u2019s not just about the books\u2014it\u2019s about the complete lack of respect for my things. My first instinct is to kick them out (yes, I understand the legal complexities of tenancy and eviction), but instead, I\u2019ve decided that I no longer want to cover the bulk of the bills. I\u2019ve drafted a document that evenly splits all household expenses, which will increase their contribution by at least $500. WIBTA if I taped it to their door? This isn\u2019t the arrangement we originally agreed upon when they moved in, but at this point, I feel that if they can blatantly disrespect my belongings, they no longer deserve my generosity. ",

A couple days later she was texting in a groupchat we were in with another friend i had been sleeping because i worked thirds. She got upset because i hadn\u2019t responded but by the time i had woke up the conversation was over. I tried to just let it go she continued to get upset about me calling one of our other friends and not adding her to the call yet she had just been on the phone with them. I didn\u2019t really talk to her then all of the sudden she had unfriended me on every social media platform and never said a word to me on what exactly i did wrong.The next week i had messaged her asking what was going on and she said that if feels like im her friend but she\u2019s not mine. at this point i was extremely confused because i had not know what was going on bc nothing was every brought up i just wondered why she unfriended me. we got into an argument because she had been pretty disrespectful towards me the last week or so over the littlest things. she had just treated me a little differently ever since the football game situation. She was just saying or doing disrespectful acts, like saying the person i liked was ugly or ignoring me for no reason, or talking about me behind my back to my best friend. Long story short we had talked about it and she ended up telling me that i have called her fat and saying her boyfriend is ugly. She explained that it was okay for her to call a guy i thought was cute ugly but wasn\u2019t okay for me to do so. I never once have i said that she is fat or anything along those lines because i myself struggle with body dysmorphia and know exactly how that feels.

Most recently she had my sister(the one that still lives at home) text me and ask if my husband can come help unload pellets caz my brother in law is sick. Mind you we help my parents a lot, just did pellets with them last time they got a truck load delivery.This one time I decide to tell them no. Ask your other kids that live in town to help for once, why is is always my husband that has to help? (We are the only children/siblings that live out of town, everyone else lives in same town as my parents.) This conversation is between my sister and I, who proceeds to screenshot and send to my mother...who then texts me to say we won't ask you for anything again....here we F***ing go again. I'm tired of fighting over the stupidest stuff. We are allowed to say no one time.  AITA?It wont let me attach a pic of proof.  ",

        "selftext": "So, I\u2019ll start this by saying my brother and I are 10 years apart. He\u2019s 19 and I\u2019m 29. When I was little, I wanted a sibling and told my parents. My mom was like only if you help out with him - I, being 9 at the time, didn\u2019t realize what that all entailed and said yes. So, fast forward, brother is born, and I\u2019m continuously treated like a 3rd parent. When brother is in HS (sophomore year on) he was super angsty and lashed out a lot. Generally it felt like our relationship was only good if I walked on egg shells. So fast forward, I get married and during that same timeline leading up to the wedding, my mom leaves (during brothers senior year of HS). Sort of out of the blue in terms of she left without conversation but the marriage was not great anyhow. Dad takes full responsibility for brother while mom moves.  Brother graduated and dad decides he wants to go on a \u201cfind himself\u201d road trip. And he basically tells me that I need to take brother in and tells brother I would. Now, brother, who nearly failed out of HS, decides he was to go to community college and then to university so will need support with that. Dad looks to me and says you can do that. Nobody discussed it with me or my husband. I\u2019m reluctant because of how the relationship was slightly toxic at times and also it was sprung on me out of the blue. Also, because since distancing myself from family I realize i felt parentified and I don\u2019t want kids or to be a third parent, I want to be a sister. I also felt like both parents were just saying we\u2019re done, here you go!  I expressed my feelings and brother says I\u2019m abandoning him and basically cussed me out. Dad decides okay he will stay and continue taking care of brother until he gets into university. I\u2019ll mention that dad and brothers relationship is good - dad just said he\u2019s ready to live his life and that\u2019s why he wanted to take this road trip (that had no timeline). So now brother is pissed at me and said I\u2019ve abandoned him (I\u2019ve helped him get school supplies, give him $ every month, and registered him for health insurance and classes) because I wanted our parents to raise and house him vs me. I see his perspective that he felt unwanted and it KILLS me. I have so much guilt. Like for me and my happiness I wanted to focus on my marriage and building my life (married for less than 5 months at this point) but the side of me that loves my brother is like okay I\u2019m a POS. I feel like my parents are constantly putting me in bad situations to be a third parent and it\u2019s damaging my relationship with brother. I guess I need to know AITA for feeling this way and not immediately agreeing to take brother in? Brother thinks I\u2019m the asshole - parents honestly are just like \u201cit is what it is\u201d but I think they think I\u2019m slightly the asshole too. ",

        "selftext": "My husband (M36) and I (F32) have an 18-month-old daughter and a son on the way.  I'm a good wife and easy-going. I've been the breadwinner our entire relationship. I make $250K and pay the majority of our bills. I keep myself in amazing physical shape, work out daily, and still have visible abs 22 weeks into my second pregnancy. I also handle the household responsibilities (cooking/cleaning) and 99% of the childcare (my husband has fed our daughter maybe 2 meals and given her as many baths in her short little life.)  Husband had promised me he was going to make dinner last night. This was a very rare thing and I was excited for it. He calls me 3 hours before he's due home asking if I'd mind if he cooked tomorrow instead so he can go to his buddy's after work. This particular friend is an unmarried and childless pothead which is fine, no judgment. But every time my husband comes back from hanging out with him he is stoned out of his mind. I accept his weed use and don't complain about it (except when he does it in the house because we have a toddler and I'm pregnant) but he comes home half dead after these hang outs.  I honestly tell him I was looking forward to dinner so I'm disappointed and wish I had known earlier but of course he can go.  He gets home around 7 and I wasn't exactly thrilled to see him. We wake up this morning and he tells me he feels unloved and that it's a huge problem that I'm passive aggressive any time he wants to hang out with his friends. To be fair, this is kind of true. We lived in downtown Chicago when we met and I gave up my entire life to move to the middle of nowhere to be by his family. He has tons of friends here and despite my best efforts I only have 1. So I'm lonely, and I miss my old life at times. I told him that he can't expect me to be elated to have him come home all stoned when I have to be sober/pregnant and doing the majority of the household tasks. I told him he could work on catering to me more during pregnancy (I often ask for back rubs and he has never once given me one.)  He freaked out on me, told me this isn't transactional, told me I'm annoying to ask for back rubs and to give it a rest, and then to add insult to injury said my job was easy. Which is funny because if it's so easy it would be great for him to go out and earn the same money that I make as he makes less than half of what I do and I'm real tired of being the provider and the homemaker.   Anyway, this is when I tell him that grown men with kids do not go get stoned with their buddies after work. They come home and be with their families.  Apparently this was so egregious he left for the day without saying goodbye. He acts like I prevent him from having any friends which isn't true. I always encourage him to see his friends and go on trips and on and on. But I will admit that I can be passive aggressive about it just because I don't ever get to do the same kinds of things.  I am so curious to know, AITA? ",

        "selftext": "I (34f) received a text from my brother (30m) asking if I had time to chat, this message made me extremely anxious, as it is unlike him, but I was at work so replied that I would call him after I finished work. For context about 3 years ago our dad took his life and I received a call at work telling me I needed to come home, so now vague messages or calls from my family of this sort can be extremely distressing. I did try and call him before I finished work as I was very worried but he wouldn't tell me what was going on, he just seemed very upset and said we'd talk later. I said it wasn't fair of him to do that and he needed to tell me what was going on and he hung up on me. I sent a message and said if he didn't call me back I would send my husband around to check on him but he said he wasn't home so I asked where he was and he said he was driving home from work. I tried calling him again after work and at first he didn't answer but then on my second call he answered and I asked where he was and what was going on, he gave me one word answers telling me where he was but wouldn't tell me what was going on and why he was upset or why he had messaged me asking to talk. I was getting very worried and upset and drove round to his house to wait for him to get home. I stayed in my car and when he saw my car he must have avoided coming home and messaged me telling me to go home and said that he hadn't done anything wrong, and I was guilt tripping him when he was struggling. I replied that if he didn't want to talk now that was okay but I wanted to know he was home safe, that I would stay in my car but I wanted to know when we would be talking about what was going on. I saw his car drive up the driveway and after waiting for a while I drove home, he seemed to still be sitting in his car. I haven't heard anything from him yet but I did get a call from my mum (she normally lives with my brother but is away at the moment), my brother had also tried to call her but she had been busy and missed the call and when she tried to call him back he hadn't answered. I told her what had happened and she said he might have lost his job because earlier in the week he had been told that 15% of the staff would be cut. While I understand this would be very stressful, I don't understand why he couldn\u2019t just tell me what had happened and had to cause me so much worry. He is still living at home with my mum and he has savings so losing his job (if that is what has happened) is not going to lead to him being homeless or unable to pay for things. I later heard from my mum that she had got a message from my brother and he still doesn't want to talk but we know he's ok. Am I being self-centred for being upset with how he's handled this? Am I guilt tripping him by telling him he can't message me telling me he needs to talk and then not talking to me? I'm honestly so mad at him but am I just making it all about me when he's the one who's going through a tough time? Am I the asshole?",

        "selftext": "ETA:My husband doesn\u2019t do gifts, his family was never big on gifts and it shows.  He requested I send links to things I want because he isn\u2019t creative to know what I want. He likes when I just tell him things \u2014 clear and direct. If I do not ask for a gift (birthday, Christmas, etc) I\u2019m not receiving anything. This happened in 2024. He asked me to pick an engagement ring out because he just couldn\u2019t decide. He TOLD ME HE WOULD BUY THIS NECKLACE 2 years ago, and I\u2019ve waited this long. I sent links, photos, we have walked through pandora together to see what it is I wanted. We are in couples counseling to work on communication and putting in effort since he struggles with it. He\u2019s well aware he struggles with this. So for everyone telling me to just buy it myself, it defeats the purpose of him saying he will buy it and requesting links to what I want. I thought about buying it myself for quite a while, but I have waited patiently for him to put in the effort and keep his word.  My husband (28m) and I(29f) have been married nearly a year now, and our anniversary is coming up soon. Ever since we have dated I have expressed how I\u2019d love a dainty initial necklace with the letter d to wear daily. Corny? Sure, but I love it. Anyway\u2026after a year of not receiving the necklace I started showing him pictures on Etsy of the ones I love (small gold plates with a lower case d in typewriter font \u2014 all of them were this font and style) we even walked through pandora to the custom engraved section and how he could write it and that would be very precious and meaningful to me. He thought it was neat and this whole time I thought he was absorbing what I was saying and listening. All he absorbed was the word \u2018dainty\u2019 apparently. This comes down to this morning. He expressed he was bored at work (night shift and he works for weeks at a time 1000 miles away from me). And this morning he bought a small (in size) but very thick bulky d necklace is some kind of frilly cursive that doesn\u2019t even look like a d. We share an email and I had literally opened it to check our daily emails like I do daily and it refreshed and there was the purchase. I texted him and expressed that it\u2019s absolutely nothing like I\u2019ve expressed for years. I\u2019ve waited this long for a necklace \u2014 I want to actually like and wear it. He told me I wanted dainty and that it is dainty, and I tried to explain dainty and delicate doesn\u2019t just mean in size and he googled it sent me the definition of dainty. I told him it was absolutely nothing like I\u2019ve shown him for years and to just cancel the order. Naturally this makes me ungrateful in his eyes. AITAH?",

So I have these three friends, That i'll call Victoria, Molly and Maria. I've been best friends with Maria since 1st grade, and i've known Victoria and Molly since 4th grade. A few weeks ago, me and my friend Molly were just joking around about the topics we'd talk about to each other, when she suddenly brought up that her and Maria had been talking about some big secret all about me. I asked what it was, since i was curios of what big secret was going on about me. She said that Maria had been feeling a lot like my friend, Victoria, completely took me over, and that we're leaving her out. Molly said Maria had gone so far as to befriend my friend i've had since kindergarten (let's call her Bella) just to make me jealous and spend more time with Maria. I was immediately shocked that she'd try to make me jealous and that she felt that way, since yes, me and Victoria have been together a lot, but Maria was almost always with us when me and Victoria were together. Molly told me not to tell Maria, since it could ruin our friendship. I agreed and kept quiet. In class, i tried to be more with Maria to show her that i still value our friendship, but deep down i felt like a complete asshole for making Maria feel that way. Fast forward 2 weeks later, Me, Victoria, Maria and another friend are working on a group project. Victoria gets stressed because only me and her are doing anything. Victoria tells Maria to stop messing around and do something productive, to which Maria gets annoyed and asks her what she should do. Victoria gets angry and stops responding to her. Right when we go to present the project, Maria pulls me aside to tell me that she feels like me and Victoria are leaving her out. I've been sick, so i haven't spoken to her since.

Because of that we wanted to spend as much as time as possible with my family since I didn't see the for 4 years.While booking the ticket she said that it was ok for us to come for so long and we didn't speak about money. In this house they live my parents(f65, m57), my sister(F40), her husband(M40), their teenager(M12) and their kid(f2).  The teenager is giving problems with his behavior as he doesn't want to do homework, being disrespectful towards the grands, not helping anyhow in home. My sister's husband works so much that he just comes home to sleep so my sister is responsible for the education of the little ones but since the personality of the teenager is stronger that my sister one he just doesn't listen to her and does what he wants. He is also disrespectful towards my parents and they obviously want to help her in the matter of her education but she doesn't want because she is proud, don't want anyone besides her or the father to have authority to him, don't want anyone to even touch him.  So this created such conflict that time by time my parents even left the house to go back to their one leaving them alone.  But my sister cannot manage such house (cooking, staying with the little one, cleaning, in the summer tend to the massive garden, electrical/gas/plumbing possible issues) so she prayed them to come back.  In this whole situation we came and my sister says that we make her feel uncomfortable with our presence after 2 months whenever she shouts to her teenager.  Also she wanted us to help with the grocery money on which we agreed but she didn't specify when and how. Just expecting us to hand money every time I think. Plus she spoke about money just to me not my partner who holds all our money since I don't work. So at the end we just gave money whenever she asked (again to me!?) And on top of that she explained to my partner that they are struggling now, many debts in order to make him feel pity and I think give her more money for the groceries. Plus we came from Italy by 2 flights landing in Russian city far away from sisters home. From there she picked up with my father by car(14 hrs driving). Now they want us to go alone by 2 trains to that city. Train where they control people's documents and belongings for security.14 hrs back and forth it's a long driving time but they are 2 and I came first time after 4 years and gos know when I'll come back. I told her that it's gonna be uncomfortable for us since I don't speak Russian well and I'm gonna be with a foreigner by she replied that we are grown up. Now she is making jokes that we can go by foot. Now we have to leave in a week.

We live in a very small town- about 5000 inhabitants- that has a LOT of stray dogs, people unfortunately take them to the campus\u2019s farm and abandon them as puppies. Recently two more pups were found in campus, so we talked about it and adopting one of them didn\u2019t seem like a bad idea, our new house has a fairly big garden space and one small dog is easy enough to take around if after graduating we decide to move into a bigger city. Well\u2026 turns out this other girl, let\u2019s call her Jane, has been posting around photos of the abandoned puppies and making go funds me to take them to a vet and castrate them, and we told her that we\u2019d be taking one of them home, for her not to worry. It was fine for a day, until I received a message from Jane saying she took both of them to her house (she has 7 stray dogs that are sick and decided to take in two puppies) until we moved to the new house. I found it weird, because well\u2026 why was she doing that? But I decided to donate a hundred bucks for her to get some dog food and keep them until next week. I made it very clear which one of them we would take and that we preferred to take her to the vet ourselves.Some time passed and she just texted my friend \u201chey, would you be upset if I donated both of the puppies to my friend? I don\u2019t want to separate them since they\u2019re siblings\u201d and tried to guilt trip him into either adopting both or none. For context: he\u2019s autistic and cares a lot about animals, so when she did that he agreed to take in both.Fast forward to today, I just discovered all of that, that we would be taking both, and also that she got 500 bucks in debt with the local vet because she decided to take both of them and said WE would pay for both consults, meds and surgeries. I got very upset that we\u2019re now in debt with the vet, for two dogs we haven\u2019t even adopted yet for a bunch of stuff they didn\u2019t even need in the first place and that I wasn\u2019t aware of. I messaged her to try and understand what was she doing, she cursed a lot and basically told me to never direct a word at her again.I don\u2019t want anything to do with this situation anymore and my friend also agrees this is out of hand. I feel really bad that we told her we\u2019d take a dog and she spent a lot of money and time and effort, but I never asked her help in any way, she just jumped in as an adoption manager and invented a bunch of problems as if she was elected responsible for all the abandoned dogs in the city.

        "selftext": "I (18F) live with my dad\u2019s family, which includes his younger sister, younger brother, and his mom (my grandmother). My grandma has always been a nightmare to my mom. She constantly orders her around, making her do all the household chores\u2014cooking, receiving packages, cleaning, basically everything\u2014while never asking her own kids to do anything. On top of that, my mom is expected to think of what to cook for my grandma every day, and if she doesn\u2019t pick the perfect meal, my grandma either whines, refuses to eat, or says she\u2019s not hungry anymore. My dad works a lot, and I\u2019ve tried to tell him that his mom treats my mom like a servant, but he just neglects the issue. He doesn\u2019t outright deny it, but he acts like he doesn\u2019t see it happening. I think part of it is because my dad is the eldest son, so he has this weird soft spot for his mom. But at the same time, he\u2019s not doing anything to fix the situation, so my mom just has to deal with it. Tonight, my grandma (who is disabled) asked me to help her up the stairs. She doesn\u2019t need physical assistance, just for someone to stand behind her to make sure she doesn\u2019t tip over. I was busy, so I told my little cousin to do it instead. But honestly, even if I wasn\u2019t busy, I don\u2019t want to help someone who has treated my mom like garbage for years. My mom is physically and mentally exhausted, and it pisses me off that we have to live with my dad\u2019s family when we\u2019re not even well off financially. They\u2019re slowing us down economically, which means my mom doesn\u2019t even get to take proper breaks or vacations. It\u2019s painful to watch. After I told my cousin to help, my grandma started whining to my uncle, complaining that I \u201cpassed my responsibility\u201d onto my cousin instead of doing it myself. And this is just one example\u2014whenever we don\u2019t do exactly what she tells us to, she whines to her kids instead of actually asking them for help. Instead of telling her own children to step up, she just complains to them about how no one is listening to her, which is ironic because she never actually expects them to do anything. edit; thank you so much for the motivating words! i told my mom about this post and it made her giggle fr hahaha. i don\u2019t think she would\u2019ve expected me to write about this or for it to even reach a lot of people. thank you guys, i\u2019ll try all your suggestions and so will my mom! if we can\u2019t get out, i hope at least we can make this house a better place and less toxic. i also wish all the best to everyone, especially those in the same situation. \ud83d\udc96",

        "selftext": "Hey! So I 21, my bestfriend / flatmate 21F, and our mutual friend 21M were sitting around last night watching some TV on my laptop. Last month, I dropped my phone on my screen and it broke the display, and I had to pay \u00a3270 ($335) to get it replaced with a refurbished screen. To replace it with a new screen would\u2019ve been around \u00a3550 ($680). I\u2019m a student who\u2019s only just started working part time and absolutely could not afford 550, so I chose the refurbished option. Now, last night, my best friend moved my laptop by the screen, and cracked the display. The whole display wasn\u2019t working for around 5 minutes after she did it, and once it turned back on it has a thumb print shaped black hole, a crack, and massive lines across both edges. I didn\u2019t see her do it, it was just her and our friend\u2019s gasp that made me look up.  She was not at all apologetic, she was laughing the whole time. I kept saying it wasn\u2019t funny, and she kept laughing - going to the extent of hiding her face in her clothes to cover up that she was still laughing. She never apologised, and I acted cold with her until our friend left about an hour later because of how mad I was. She just went to bed and didn\u2019t say anything. I know she didn\u2019t \u2018do\u2019 anything and it was likely the old refurbished screen, but it realistically wouldn\u2019t have happened if she didn\u2019t grab it. She hasn\u2019t offered to pay or even apologised for doing anything. She texted me later that night and apologised for laughing, saying it probably made me feel worse and came across insensitive, but still no apology for actually breaking it / any offer to pay anything.  I\u2019m going to speak to the repair guy today and see if he could potentially fix it for free or a reduced rate / if it was a mistake with his installation or the screen or something AITA if I ask her to pay? I know it\u2019s petty but it wouldn\u2019t have happened without her grabbing it - she cracked my display. EDIT:Thank you for all the replies basically confirming what I believe she should do\ud83d\ude2d I asked her and she sent me a 9 minute long voice note about how she won\u2019t be paying me back. She\u2019s \u2019touched hers and her boyfriends laptops\u2019 in the same way and it\u2019s never done that before, she then claimed it was falling off the edge of the sofa (onto a pillow) and she went to catch it, and then doubled down on how she has no money and can\u2019t afford to. The last point is understandable but stleast offer to pay me back? I also can\u2019t afford it? I feel like this is an insane interaction. I also just had a class with her in which she ignored me and ran out of the room as soon as she could after. I don\u2019t know what to do, I hate arguing with her because she gets nasty, personal and mean, and we live alone just the two of us so it\u2019s awkward. I always end up rolling over and apologising. ",

I was working Wednesday night shifts after school but I realised Wednesday was my busiest day and I always have heaps of work set after school that is generally due by the next day.  And so it came to Wednesday the 4th of Feb and I had so much work that I wouldn\u2019t get done between the time I got home after work and the time I wanted to go to bed to get a good sleep for the next day. And so I cancelled my shift the morning of, giving my boss notice that I couldn\u2019t come in and explained why and said that I couldn\u2019t do any more Wednesday nights and he completely understood and said it was absolutely fine. I got home that afternoon and started working when my Mum (F51) got home from work and said it was okay and understood that I was overwhelmed and had a lot of work to be done.  Now it\u2019s Thursday night and I\u2019ve been invited to drinks and dinner next Wednesday night to say farewell to some coworkers of mine at my second job. I told my Mum and she went off, abusing me and yelling saying if I can\u2019t work on a Wednesday night because of how busy my schoolwork is then I can\u2019t do anything but school work on a Wednesday night.

        "selftext": "Im a pretty young female, and me and my sister live across the US from eachother. This summer I went to visit her and my mom, whom I hadn't seen in about 2 years. I was supposed to stay there from the middle of June until the beginning of July. Now, about 2-3 months prior, I had dislocated my knee and landed on said knee while falling. I also had to sit screaming for help in that position for almost 30 minutes, and then had to wait an extra 15 for my dean to finally come to my room and get me to the hospital--where they told me I had fractured something, I dont really know what, but it was small enough to where it could heal on its own without surgery. At my grandma's she has this huge case of stairs, which im scared to go down due to how unsafe they feel--since they have huge gaps and im scared of falling--but especially since I had just stopped using the cast I had on, my knee sometimes hurt when put under pressure when walking down stairs, running, etc. \u00a0After about 3-4 weeks, I got homesick and decided I would go back early. I wasn't really feeling any semblance of joy based on the past experiences with this side of my family, and it didn't seem like they had changed at all. So, about 4 days after that, I was driving with my grandparents and sister to the airport. I waved my sister and grandma goodbye (grandpa stayed in the car) and was on my merry way. However, while waiting for boarding time, my heart sunk. My sister texted me a video, which I listened to--showing how my grandma was saying in explicit detail how much weight I had gained since they last saw me, and how all that weight must have been why my knee was hurting so much, even though i had stated many times that I had dislocated my knee. I fully went up and texted her, going on a long rant about why she would say things like that behind my back and she couldn't be talking, seeing that she would constantly complain on how big she was. A few minutes later, she saw it--responding basically blaming everything on my sister, and how she shouldnt have told me lies and she was trying to ruin the family by spouting a bunch of BS. I told her that I saw video proof, where she again tried to blame my sister. My sister texted me that my grandma was yelling at her, and honestly I felt even worse. I failed to realize that this would probably effect her standing with our grandma. However we talked it out and she seemed to not care about it because she doesnt wanna be around someone who talks to me like that anyways. My mom also texted me, telling me about how I shouldnt have said anything and shouldve let it go. However, I dont think I shouldve. My grandma has a history about talking to people like this, constantly belittling others and trying to make herself feel good. I thought it was time somebody tell her back on it. So reddit, AITA for telling off my grandma when she told my sister the reason my knee hurt was because of all the extra weight I had on me?? ",

        "selftext": "Hello Reddit universe, first post. Let\u2019s get into it. I (38 M) have a girlfriend (Bonni) with a 13-year old son, and they live in a house with her sister. Her sister has a boyfriend, Dude, who comes around but doesn\u2019t live there. He normally carries a pistol on him. I haven\u2019t known him long, but he seems like a nice guy and we typically get along. He has seemed responsible with his guns which I appreciate, especially with kids around. I\u2019ve been around firearms my whole life and take gun safety seriously. The other night Bonni, her son and I get home to an empty house and as we are getting ready for dinner, she notices a small fanny pack on the kitchen table that doesn\u2019t belong to us. She moves it, notices it\u2019s heavy and asks me if I think there\u2019s gun in there. She handed it over and it was pretty obvious that\u2019s what it was. Knowing he likes to practice concealed carry, I wondered if it was loaded and ready to fire. So I unzipped the bag and took a look. I wanted to make sure Dude at least left it in relatively \u2018safe\u2019 condition. Thought about just moving it, but I really wanted to know the exact situation that was left unattended on the kitchen table.  What I found was a loaded Glock 9mm with a round in the chamber and ready to fire. It was holstered, but being a Glock, there is no traditional \u2018safety\u2019 on the gun and anyone could just pull it out and fire off a round. So I dropped out the magazine, cleared the round from the chamber, and put it back in his bag in a much safer condition than I found it.  I then text him telling him I did that, and let\u2019s make sure that doesn\u2019t happen again. He then calls me NOT to apologize, but to tell me how pissed off he is that I violated his privacy. A day later thought he\u2019d come to his senses but I hear that he is still livid and that I should apologize, although I have not heard a single bit of remorse or apology from him to Bonni for leaving an unsecured, loaded gun sitting out for anyone to get at.  In my mind, the safety of everyone in the house, especially the kid, is priority #1 and should far outweigh anyone\u2019s feelings of privacy violation. No, I wouldn\u2019t be stoked if someone in general decided to open and look in my bag. But if I were to make the huge mistake of leaving a loaded gun in a common area where a kid lives, if anything I\u2019d hope that someone responsible would do the same thing I did, make the situation safer, and help prevent any chance of my mistake becoming something much worse.  AITA for prioritizing this safety concern over Dude\u2019s privacy? UPDATE: To be fair I missed a detail - turns out he had given the gun to Bonni\u2019s sister to take with them to lock up, and she left it on the table on accident. ",

The last time he saw me, he asked if I could take a day off work and help him move about 10 miles to my local village. I said no, because I have a bad back and I wouldn't be able to get the time off work. My other friend said the same thing about not being able to get the time off work.

The place i am renting is only for duration of my studies. My cousin (f18) studies in a different place but wants to move here after studies. And my other cousin (m16) as well. So, this brought up the idea from my family. That two of my cousins can all move together to one apartment. I refused for a couple of reasons.  1. My cousin (f18) is involved with a lot of boys despite her parents being against it. In one occasion she sneaked out with her bf (now ex) during an important family function. The whole extended family somehow blamed me for it, even though i tried to stop her from doing it and even defending her. She also threw me under the bus, so even after years they still bring it up and blame me. Also i got scolded right there and then. This really changed how i see my family, and thats also one of the reasons i moved so far away even though i had the choice to not.  2. She again used my name to get out of meeting up with another bf. She wasnt caught but i felt really betrayed. In case they get caught i have no doubt that i will be blamed.  3. The family plays favorites with her. I have no problem with this, as my mom and dad loves me a lot but in some occasions it makes me sad. I struggle with mental health already and i think that it will make it worse.  I know that this is objectively a good, great idea even. Its a lot better to share rent and live with people who i already know. We are still close despite what happened, but living with someone i know is way better than a stranger.  But i am putting all that aside just for my mental health and its selfish of me. My mom and her mom and dad are both really adamant on this decision, and called me ridiculous for not wanting to do it. My mom called me and said that its because i hate her, but i really dont. My dad also doesnt want me to move in with her, because he knows that how much that affected me.  ",

When he was trying to find an apartment in the city because he had a shitty roommate, and didn't feel cool at his place I let him crash with me for a few months too. It was difficult for a bit because his sleeps do not match mine at all and he has a lot of mood swings and bouts of depression so I need to be a lot more available and supportive because I was with him for all his worse moments instead of him being able to calm down and regulate by himself when in moods we maybe wouldn't show other people. This seemed fair as I have my own issues and like I said I'm very in love with this person so I'm trying not to feel guilty about being in his space so much because he makes it clear he wants me here and wants me to feel safe. Now that we're living together tho every time a friend of his stays over I go to my own place to give them privacy and that means that with enough notice I can pack some things and organize my week differently. (My commute to work, my groceries,...) (The now) My boyfriend has been acting manic and erratic the last few days, every time I wake up he's moving things around saying he feels crushed by all the things around him that it causes him distress to see things messy. Sometimes the room is fully clean but there's a piece of furniture or wall decorations that HAVE TO GO. He doesn't expect me to help him do all of this but he's doing these manic tasks sometimes at 4 or 5 in the morning while I'm sleeping and sometimes I can get a little overwhelmed even though I know it's not his fault he just feels things intensely  Today we had a dinner booked with friends we meet every few weeks, we had already missed our last few meet ups because he cancelled last minute and this is often the case because he wakes up around dinner time. Then he said he wasn\u2019t going again, he woke up super late and was nitpicking things to do in the house. I begged him to come with me and please think of it do something else but it was pointless. I left the house upset said I would go myself and set a boundary with myself that I wasn't going to cancel something I wanted to do to relax to help him manage a tantrum. After I left he invited a friend over to help, the friend was late and he ended up doing a lot of heavy lifting himself. He texted me and said the friend was staying over so he could stay later which meant I would have to plan out my next day with little notice. I came to meet them we had a few drinks I helped them with the last stuff and started to get super tired but his friend had gotten into bed because he was cold and they were watching movies together now.. He made up the couch for me and said I looked and was acting weird but didn't know how to respond. AITA that this is hurtful? How to I talk about it?",

Every time I see him, I mention that he should go and see a dermatologist and get checked out (It's been YEARS I've asked him to do so).  My mom has also tried to make him appts and he has canceled/not gone. I just got checked by a dermatologist and had to have a spot treated on my face so I decided enough is enough. I asked my mom to send me his insurance information which she quickly did. I looked up his coverage & found a Dr. nearby. I then called my dad to tell him that I was setting an appointment up. We had already been texting about it so he wasn't blind-sighted on what I was up to. When talking he wanted to change the subject & tried to distract me etc.  but I persisted and gave him some avail dates/times.  When he finally relented on a day/time (which I think was only to shut me up), I scheduled the appointment and sent him the details and also put a reminder on his calendar. However, I feel bad that I had to bully him into it.  I honestly don't even know if he will end up going in the end. I know that I wouldn't like being told what to do, but I just want what is best for him. I think he is scared of what they may find or need to do (which I completely understand- as drs can be scary). We all just want to make sure that he is healthy and there are no underlying cancer issues. So AITA? EDIT: I would go with him but I live in a different state. So I may need to ask a sibling who does live close and/or my mom to go & be with him. Update #1: My dad is not upset with me for making this appointment and he told me he called the office and confirmed with them (Step 1).  Now to wait and see if we keeps it and goes (Step 2).

        "selftext": "Two of my friends are going on a weekend trip to another state. They had already booked to go together before I even agreed to go, and were happy to split the cost between the two of them. They then asked if I would want to go (this MORNING) and I said yes at the time because I didn't really think it through and it was a spontaneous decision. They called me tonight and we booked train tickets, and the hotel is payable when we arrive but we said we would just split the cost after. They talked about what they plan on doing whilst there and it's a big weekend of clubbing and drinking and after thinking about it I've decided that I just really don't want to go- I'm not in the position to be spending lots of money and partying just isn't my scene anymore. I've cancelled on the last few weekends out too because I haven't wanted to party hard and they just don't understand and have got really angry at me for being flakey and now saying they're left with having to pay for the hotel. Should I just suck it up and go given that I'm young and should just enjoy myself- or go with my instinct and have the weekend in like I enjoy?   To clarify: They were going regardless. They decided and booked the hotel BEFORE i was involved. they asked me, i said yes which was a rushed decision. On our call- they said they wanted to party really hard and i dont. that made me rethink- and since i've been stressed about that and money. The train tickets have nothing to do with me dropping out, they have their own tickets and like i said..they were going in the first place as just the 2 of them!",

Get up rubbing my eyes and check the hatch which is closed, no ladder present below hatch means no one got in there from the hatch. I put my ladder there and check the attic, empty. Hear something running on the roof at this point, prolly a cat. Get down, SO is panicking asking what I saw, tell her nothing in the attic, something maybe on the roof. She  wants to call the cops and is asking a 100 questions. Ask her to wait while I check it out to settle her down. I circle the house twice while shining a bright torch over the roof. Don't see anything there. Get inside house and explain I went around the house twice shining the torch on the roof. There is no one there. But I am bombarded with 'who was it then'? No one. 'who could it have been?' no one was there . 'what were they doing on the roof' I don't even know if someone was there. 'how could they have gotten up there' I don't know. 'how do you not know, take a guess' I don't think anyone was there, probably a cat running around. 'You need to go speak with the neighbors to see if they saw something while I call the cops' I am not going to wake the neighbors at 3am and you are not calling the cops, just go to bed. 'No you need to go speak with the neighbors because you don't know anything. You don't know who it was, what they were doing there, how they got up there' 'Listen, I don't know who was there. I cannot know this. I don't know what they were doing there, I cannot know this, I dont know how they got up there, if you want to ask hypothetically then maybe they flew there, they parachuted off a plane and landed there, maybe it was spiderman. I just don't know because I cannot know. I have walked around the house and found nothing. You think me waking the neighbor will solve the mystery even though he knows less than us?   She is pissed off now saying it was a stressful situation and that I should have been cooperative and understanding of her feelings but instead I was a real asshole. No matter which way I look at it I can't think where I went wrong. I am not in the best moods at 3am",

        "selftext": "I'm a 26-year-old woman with a male cat named Michelangelo, or Mikey. He was initially a gift from my mom and her boyfriend to my sister-in-law (SIL) when he was just a tiny kitten. My brother and SIL lived with me then in our shared apartment. However, they leave Mikey behind when they decide to move out and find their own place. I took it upon myself to look after him. I've been responsible for all his needs, from feeding him to taking him to the vet and buying litter. Lately, I've realized that my sister-in-law treats Mikey as if he still belongs to her, even though she has shown little interest in or care for him since they moved out. She never checks in on him or contributes financially to his care, which I find frustrating. My brother and SIL argue that it doesn't matter who cares for the cat because my mom gifted Mikey to my sister-in-law. They believe that since she was the one who received him, she has a right to call him her cat. However, it's unfair for her to claim ownership of Mikey when she has abandoned him and doesn't participate in his care. Compounding the issue, my brother and sister-in-law are planning to move into a new place that doesn't allow pets, which means they would be unable to take Mikey with them regardless. Given this situation, I feel justified in asserting that Mikey is my cat since I am the one taking care of him. So, AITA for referring to Mikey as my cat?",

        "selftext": "My roommate (48 M) has a daughter (16) who he has had a turbulent relationship with pretty much her whole life. She ran away when she was 14, and has been couch surfing/staying with her mom (who I don\u2019t know much about)/living at a group home since then. She didn\u2019t see her dad much at all in that time, maybe once a month for a few minutes so he could give her money. Past that she refused to see him entirely. For the last few weeks she\u2019s started coming to our house almost every day.  I don\u2019t mind her coming over, I would hope that her and her dad would have a good relationship and see each other. This issue is we all smoke weed. The daughter smokes weed as well, and I have conflicting opinions on that, I was a huge stoner (among many other things) as a teenager and know that telling a teen that\u2019s already into that kind of thing what to do doesn\u2019t work. It didn\u2019t work on me and I\u2019m sure it wouldn\u2019t work on the daughter. She\u2019s gonna do what she\u2019s gonna do and I\u2019m not her parent so I\u2019m not one to tell her what to do anyway. But roommate will actively get high with his underage daughter (and her friends!!) in our house, and it makes me DEEPLY uncomfortable. When she\u2019s here I just keep to my room, because in my opinion it\u2019s incredibly inappropriate to do things like that with a child and I don\u2019t want to be around it. When I try to talk to roommate about it he just laughs it off and won\u2019t engage with the conversation. I don\u2019t know how to get it through his head that it\u2019s not okay to get a kid high (especially ones that aren\u2019t yours!!!). It bothers me even more because I\u2019m on (unsupervised) parole and if anything were to happen and police found out what he was doing that I could be implicated or associated with it and they would take me back to jail.  I might be TA because this is the first time in a long time his daughter has been willing to spend any time with him, and I\u2019d hate to get in the way of them having a friendly relationship (and I firmly believe he is not capable of having a parental relationship with her, mostly because of who he is as a person but also because I don\u2019t think she would allow for it and would disappear again) She has asked why I don\u2019t hang out with them when she\u2019s over (I\u2019m the only woman in the house and I can tell she wants me to like her, and I do! I just cannot be around that) I\u2019ve made excuses about not feeling good, etc. because I don\u2019t want to badmouth her dad to her but I\u2019m 3 seconds away from saying \u201cbecause I respect you enough as a person and a child to not behave like that around you, and because there\u2019s something deeply wrong with adults who will partake with children\u201d the next time she asks. I\u2019m not sure what to do here, I don\u2019t want to be the reason they have no relationship, she\u2019s not my kid so I have no say over what she does (and neither do her actual parents it seems), but this puts me at risk and when I tell the roommate that he does not listen. AITA? Any advice? Thanks in advance everyone.",

        "selftext": "Sorry if this is long or confusing, I\u2019ve never used Reddit before. I (26F) have been having an issue with my cousin \u201cEmma\u201d (29F) that has gotten the whole family involved, and I need some outside perspective. Our grandfather hadn\u2019t been in great health the past few years, and over the past month or two he\u2019d really gone downhill. He was admitted to the hospital a couple of weeks ago in full-on kidney failure. We\u2019d known this was coming- about a year ago a doctor had told us his kidney function was really poor and since he decided not to do dialysis, he had maybe a year left to live (turns out that doctor was exactly right). I\u2019d been to visit him in the hospital a few evenings after work, and it was rough; he wasn\u2019t too coherent and I knew there wasn\u2019t much they could do. It was sad but not really unexpected; he was 85 and like I said, health had been bad for a while.  Anyway, Emma\u2019s job doesn\u2019t have a typical 9-5 schedule, so it\u2019s easier for her to visit him at the hospital in the mornings. A few days ago I was at work when, at about 10 am, I checked Facebook on my phone. The first thing I saw was a long post from Emma announcing that our grandfather had died. Needless to say, that was NOT the way I wanted to find out. I commented telling Emma that it was wrong to post this without first making sure the whole family knew, and she should take the post down.  Just a few minutes later my father texted asking me to call him, and when I did he told me what I already knew. Turns out Emma had made her Facebook post less than an hour after he died, when there were still a lot of family members that didn\u2019t know. I wasn\u2019t the only one who found out via that post, and none of us were too happy about it. A couple of days later my uncle (Emma\u2019s dad) told me he\u2019d specifically told Emma to wait until she knew family had been notified before posting anything (we all know how obsessed with social media she is). He was livid when he learned she\u2019d posted about it so quickly despite him telling her not to. At the memorial service Emma confronted me, saying I\u2019d \u201cembarrassed\u201d her by making my comment on her Facebook post. Apparently some of her friends had seen my comment and agreed that it had been wrong of her to post the news so quickly. A lot of people are mad at her for it, and she\u2019s claiming that I \u201cturned friends and family against her\u201d by calling her out in my comment. This has just added a bunch of extra stress to an already tough situation, and I really want an outside opinion on if making the comment was wrong. ",

        "selftext": "For background info: I (17F) go to my local gym almost daily. There is a man who goes to my gym (maybe 48F) who always seems to want to converse with me. Last time, he stared at me smirking as I was trying to workout, so I gave him a rude look, hoping he\u2019d look away but instead he told me I looked angry and said I should \u201ctake my anger out on the punching bag\u201d. USUALLY; I go to the gym with a gym buddy, but today I was alone. Today while I was resting between sets, the man walked up to me from across the gym and spoke, but I kept looking down on my phone and I was listening to music. He walked away after I didn\u2019t respond and did a set of hip thrusts. After finishing another set; as I was resting, the man approached me AGAIN and I tried to ignore him. He did NOT walk away this time, so I paused my music and looked up at him. The man asked me if I was missing my friend this time, and if I came to the gym everyday, and why I went to the gym so often. He then proceeded to get on the LAT RAISE machine directly across from me\u2026. I\u2019m an anxious person and very hyper aware, and I took his questions as a way to figure out whether I was alone and vulnerable and when I\u2019d be at the gym. I cut my workout short and left. I was so upset about it, I was worried he\u2019d follow me or something (he did not). I called the gym shortly after and told the staff I didn\u2019t feel comfortable and did not want him to talk to me. She apologized for me feeling uncomfortable, told me she knew exactly who I was talking about, and let me know she had no issue relaying that to him. After relaying this story to my brother who ALSO goes to this gym; I\u2019ve been told that the man could be autistic or something of the sort, thus having a lack in social cues. I understand that, but I still feel like I should be able to workout without feeling anxious or unsafe. note: I did watch him talk to other people as he made his way around the gym; I wasn\u2019t aware that it wasn\u2019t just me, so he really might just be trying to socialize and could be missing social cues.

        "selftext": "Basically what the tittle says but here is more context. I am a 20f college student, I have great friends in college and we hang out a lot. The thing is that next spring break we want to go in a trip four days to one of ours friends house who has a house in a beach area. We have been talking about this trip for more than a year but finally we are doing it. And so my mom some weeks ago told me that she would like to go on a trip during the spring break with me, I like travelling with my mom but tbh I have only travelled not time with friends we went to a village so I am excited of going with my college friends to the beach. As any of my friends and any other person of my age I enjoy being with my friends more, partying, playing games...whatever. I love my mom and I feel awful because she has chronic back pain and when we go on a trips I follow her rhythm which I do not have a problem with but at the end there's a lot of things that we do not see. And happens the same with an Erasmus exchange that I am doing next year, I had to convince her to that for 2 years because she always tells me: you are living so good and you leave me here alone with your grandma (I live with my mom 61 and my grandma 87) and when you grow up you are gonna  be independent and leave me alone here cause your grandma won't he here forever, doesn't make you sad? She then laugh a bit and said she says it as a joke but ofc it makes me sad, I feel awful when she tell me this kind of sentences but I want to live my life too, I wanna life things. And I am an adopted child, I was adopted when I was only 20 days alive and on one side I feel I should be with her since she has given a lot of things to me and take care of me, but also wanna be independent, I'm studying hard for that. And I wanna do that trip but not rn, so I would like to change dates, but knowing my mom I am sure she would get mad and at the end we won\u00b4t do it. So, would I be the asshole for choosing the trip with my friends rather than the trip with my mom?",

        "selftext": " I (20 F) live with my Step Mom (42F) and my Dad (43M) along with my three younger siblings. I have two brothers B(18M) and T(10m) and a little sister E (9F). We have a nice sized house. We all have our own rooms. I work at an after school program so it's from 1:30 to 6:00 not a lot of hours but It's still work. I'm going to start College in the summer, fingers crossed. Anyway my brother B also works at an after school program same hours as me. Neither of us drive so He bikes and I take an Electric scooter which I payed for myself. So I typically get home before him.  The only difference between us is that he has a SHIT ton more freedom than I do. Which is fine I don't mind he has a lot of friends and goes out a lot. After work or on the weekends. Or even sometimes on the weekdays. So when I'm home my siblings E and T are also home.  My parents D and P (my step mom) are extremely social people so they always have something going on. And E and T aren't always allowed to join them on their adventures for example when they go out to have adult hang outs or parties. The times my parents stay out really late. And I do mean late they usually come back between 12:00 to 2:00am. Which I don't mind. They're adults and they can enjoy their lives.  What annoys me though is that whenever my parents leave T and E in our care (I say our care because B is supposed to help too) but it usually ends up just being me taking care of them, making them dinner, keeping them entertained, making sure they get to bed on time. Thing like that. On top of that we recently just got a puppy her name is Stella and she's only 10 weeks old so she needs to constantly be watched. And in the mornings before I leave for work I watch Stella and my other dog Diva who's only a year old. No help from him whatsoever. He stays in his room until he leaves for work or wakes up at 11:00. We both have ADHD and have medication. So we have to take it in the morning.  Anyway lately it's been getting worse. P always leaves us a list of chores she wants done before we both go to work (which is fine because I genuinely need a visual list for me to be able to get things done) And I usually end up doing 90% of them since B doesn't wake up or just doesn't leave his room. Don't get me wrong it's not that he never helps he just rarely does so. But it's so frustrating when I'm watching the kids or the dogs and doing chores while he chills in his room playing videogames. It's not like he works anymore than I do. Or does anything about the house when he is home. Plus when he randomly decides to go out guess who's stuck doing extra chores that HE should be doing? Me. It's getting really annoying, Even my parents are getting frustrated with his lack of helping. But he doesn't seem to care. AITA for telling him to do stuff around the house?",

        "selftext": "Let's jump into this: I (29F) gave birth to my 3rd baby in November.  The women in my husband's family (his 2 sisters, our sil, and his mom) and I have a group chat whereas we send pictures of our kids, tell funny stories about our day, and, in this case, send updates about possible labor.  On this particular day in November, at 37 weeks plus 5 days gestation, I reached out to inform that this just might be the day my newest baby decides to make his grand entrance. I had been having strong contractions since 5:50 that morning.  Everyone, except sil (my husband's brother's wife) responded with excitement and praying hands emoji's.  Well, according to the nurses at the hospital, I wasn't dilated enough to be admitted, despite strong and frequent contractions.This was at noon. I updated the chat. Everyone seemed concerned and asked if I still thought if it might still be that day.  I assured it was most likely going to happen that day, judging from past experiences, but I would go home to labor in comfort. This is where i might be the a-hole.  My sil, who also gave birth to her 3rd baby a couple months prior (via c-section. I am not judging nor think of her as less than, just context is key) decided to text how glad she was that I wasn't in real labor and that it's better that I wait to have the baby another couple of weeks. She then sent a bunch of screen shots and links to articles about false labor and Braxton hicks. AS IF I HAD NEVER GIVEN BIRTH BEFORE OR EXPERIENCED PREGNANCY BEFORE. I replied, mid contraction:  Not to be bity, but this ain't my first rodeo, and I know how to Google things as well.  And yes, I have been checked, and they will check again before deciding IF I should go home or not. Well, I did go home, only to go back to the hospital a couple of hours later and had my baby at 10:15 that night.  Sil does not reply to me in texts, and has since unfriended me on Facebook. (Not that I really care about that.)  I just want to know it I was an a-hole for what I said... and, in hindsight, perhaps I shouldn't have been texting in the groupchat while in labor.  So, reddit. Was I an a-hole? Edit: I meant to elaborate on the c-section detail. Which definitely makes me come across as someone who looks down on her for it. Which I do not.  Her first baby was a preemie and she had an emergency c-section. Her youngest 2 were scheduled. The point I was trying to make was that our experiences with pregnancy and childbirth are completely different.  Which, I could have said without the c-section fact. My apologies.  Edit: a little more info about my sil and my relationship. She thinks she's the matriarch of the family, even if she won't admit it. We recently moved out of state (only 2 hours away, long drive, but not as long as they treat it), a few months before I gave birth, and she started cutting us out of family get together and even created a whole new group chat without my husband and me. She is always shocked at how intelligent my husband is because he went to community college instead of a university, like she did. I didn't go to college. I saw no point in going into debt, I didn't know what I would go to college for, so I decided to wait. So she often treats me like I am unintelligent.  I think the snappy text was probably long incoming. But it was poorly timed and shouldn't have been in a group chat.It was not the first time I had gone off on her in a group chat either. She singled me out a few months prior, questioning my ability to care for my kids by myself while my husband was away for a couple of days.  Yes, in the big family group chat.So I snapped back. My husband saw the message before me and said I'll let you handle her. As he held me back many times beforehand to keep peace. Like I said, it was possibly poorly timed but long incoming. ",

        "selftext": "I (M 33) am watching my boyfriend\u2019s dog while he\u2019s away for work for about a month. My roommate (M 34) is having a stressful week at work and works most days from our apartment. On Monday and Tuesday, I went to the gym to work out with my friend who\u2019s a personal trainer and training me for free on his time. So, I left at 4:30 and came back at 6:30 and my roommate said he cannot handle dog watching while I\u2019m away and he\u2019s working. This is the calmest and least needy dog I\u2019ve ever met and he\u2019s a 10 years old yorkipoo. He just sleeps and occasionally barks when he hears our neighbors coming and going. My roommate said that he can\u2019t mentally separate having a dog hanging out at home or if I had brought home a guest and then left him alone to entertain my friend. I just needed 2 hours away to workout. My roommate was at the office most of the day Monday and Tuesday and then came home and had more work to do. He came home just as I was leaving for the gym at 4:30 and I came home and was lectured more about how I didn\u2019t listen to him and left him alone to dog sit again. I don\u2019t see how this is dog sitting; he doesn\u2019t have to walk, feed, or even interact with the dog. So, am I the asshole for not understanding where he\u2019s coming from and still trying to go to the gym for my 2 hours?  EDIT for more info: I did inform my roommate that I would be taking care of the dog for a month and he said that was totally fine. I\u2019ve also spent multiple days away with the dog at my boyfriend\u2019s place to give my roommate more space when he\u2019s working from home. This week, he\u2019s working at the office most days til 4 and I leave for the gym at 4:30. I plan on spending the rest of the week at my boyfriend\u2019s place since I know this week is a lot for my roommate. But that\u2019s also a big inconvenience for me and adds an additional 25 to 40 minutes to any commute I have to make which is usually only 5 to 10 mins. I also have to go grocery shopping so I have food at my boyfriend\u2019s place and pack enough clothes for the week. Doing all that so he doesn\u2019t have to spend 2 hours alone with the dog just seems like a lot. ",

        "selftext": "So 5 years ago me, my brother, and 2 other good friends we\u2019ve known for 20+ years planned a big trip to ski in Europe.  A year ago we started talking about doing it again for my 40th birthday but skiing in Japan this time.  We also decided to open up the invite to a specific few others that we all knew well from college and who wished they were invited on the last trip.  Two more committed so now our group was 6 people.  A couple weeks ago one friend Payton (name changed for privacy purposes) asked my brother Johny who was planning the entire trip if he could invite his half brother.  Johny told him politely no because nobody else knew him and adding a 7th would mess with logistics (guides, dinner reservations and hotel reservations) and the vibe would be different having someone there nobody knows.  Payton wasn\u2019t happy and said \u201cbut I thought we were opening up the trip to others\u201d to which Johny reminded him that was only to specific people we\u2019ve all known since college.  Well a week later Johny told people nobody can back out at this point because our most expensive hotel reservation was becoming non-refundable to which everyone confirmed they were not backing out.  4 days after this and a month before the trip, Payton tells my brother Johny and myself his half brother is coming and he\u2019s not going to be rude and uninvite him and we are being jerks for saying he can\u2019t come.  He apologizes for misunderstanding that we only opened up the invite to certain people but refuses to un-invite his half brother.  We tell him if he\u2019s truly sorry, he\u2019ll tell his brother it was a miscommunication and he\u2019ll do another trip with him.  He refuses and says he and his brother are coming on the trip and following the exact same itinerary whether we like it or not.  All 5 other members of the group call him and tell him what he\u2019s doing is very socially awkward and selfish to bring this all up after flights and hotels were non-refundable.  He still refuses to change course.  So we changed our logistics now to expel him from the ski group with guides and we aren\u2019t letting him stay in the rooms we booked and we plan to not hang out with him on the trip but he and his half brother will be on all the same flights and likely staying at same hotels which will be awkward.  Who is in the wrong here and how should this situation be handled? ",

        "selftext": "I (17F) am turning 18 in July. Because of this, I'm already starting to prepare what I'm going to take with me when I move out, even though that likely won't be a while because I also plan to move in with 2 of my close friends and we need to arrange where we'll be living first. Some things I definitely want to take with me when I move out are my gaming consoles. An Xbox 360, an Xbox One S, and a Playstation 4, all of which were given to me as birthday or Christmas presents. Because they were given to me specifically, I think it's only fair that I get to take them with me when I move out. However my mother doesn't seem to think so. My mother believes that I can only take one console with me, the ps4, and leave both Xbox consoles with them. Her justification for it is that she and my sister (5) won't have anything if I take all the consoles. She also said that it's a thing that when you get a new console the older one is passed down as a family console. I thought this was completely stupid, because they were given to me as gifts, and now she just expects me to leave 2 of them behind just so they can actually have gaming consoles. I'd like to add that I've spent my own gift money on both the ps4 AND xbox one to buy games and other things for certain games, but she's also bought quite a bit of stuff on the xbox too (DLCs for the Sims 4 mainly). That's another reason why she doesn't want me to take the xbox one, because she spent money on it herself. I feel like she's trying to just guilt trip me, but I need to know if I'm really in the wrong for wanting to take things that were given to me with me when I move out. WIBTA? Edit to add: I feel like I should have pointed this out originally, but my mother is acting like there would be absolutely no at home gaming consoles left in the house when that isn't the case at all. We have an old gamecube that has quite a few games too, all it needs is to get new cords to plug in to the tv and then the power button needs to be fixed because it's stuck pressed down Edit 2: since a lot of people are bringing up visiting my family when I move out and leaving one console there for them and switching the consoles out, that wouldn't be an option, if I leave a console it's gone for good. My parents haven't been the best people my whole life for more serious issues I didn't feel the need to go into before, but these things are making me decide to go no contact with my father and limited contact with my mother.",

I will say, she didn't use it on herself; it doesn't change the fact that she used it on something she wasn't supposed to. I learned this because I needed most of the semester to be paid for to enroll for the next semester. I told some of the people helping, they aren't the same as the government people; they are part of the college to let them know. I didn't know it would get either of us in trouble. These people almost didn't help me any more thanks to that; I was annoyed, mostly because I never knew till this year.

I have told her multiple times that i do not appreciate it. For example, I have sat alone in a restaurant for half an hour to make sure we did not lose the reservation. And this is just one of the situations which leave me frustrated. Other than that, she is a good friend and we have Lots of fun hangouts together. Well yesterday evening it was very cold and windy outside (1 Degree Celsius), and we had planned to meet in the city centre and go for food and drinks afterwards. I had texted her to remind her to leave her house on time. It takes me around 40 minutes to get there, so I cannot spontaneously just exit the house and be there, I have to plan my time. When I arrived, I was right on time (as opposed 10 minutes earlier, because I know it\u2019s useless with her anyway) and I started waiting. After around 30 minutes I lost my patience, texted her to forget it and just left. I was cold and in a bad mood, especially because she told me that she would be there \u201cright away\u201d. She apparently was there 15 minutes later and called me upset, that I don\u2019t understand how she is and I am being a bad friend. That I should not make plans if I am not okay with waiting, which I did not agree with. Still, I have never left like this before and I feel guilty for leaving her like this. Was I the asshole? Little update I have left in the comments: She called me a few hours ago, and we talked for a bit. She apologized for insulting me, ignoring my messages AND for being late this time. She sounded like she really regretted it, but I was a bit bitter about the fact that I had to take it this far for her to wake up. I did not talk about meeting up again, as I just want to let it sink in a bit more and not just two days. And I think afterwards I will use one of the suggestions that said to meet in a cafe and give her a range, such as \u201cI will be here from 15 to 15:30\u201d, and see how that works out. I truly don\u2019t want to lose her and I was sorry to hear her like this, but she hurt me first and she needs to understand that too",

        "selftext": "My (23M) friend/flatmate (34f) has a very sweet and loving cat that I believe she is not looking after very well.  For context she is a very busy university student currently studying a masters degree. Her cat has a history of running rampant in her room, has destroyed plants and various things, gone to the toilet on mine and a flatmates bed, and just done various other chaotic acts.  Personally, I believe he does these things because of her neglect and lack of care. Firstly she takes him on multiple 5+ hour car journeys a year whenever she goes home from uni. She keeps him in a cage that is just big enough to fit his bed, litter tray and food/water bowls whenever she is out (so he doesn't destroy things). He never goes outside even on walks with her. He is barely allowed outside of her room even when he is out of the cage because of his destructive nature.  He had an injury lately which meant he had to have a cone on his head and be in the cage for a while and even though the cone is off, the cage remains. She uses excuses like he is a chaotic cat and there is too much stuff in her room for him to destroy, but honestly most of it is trinkets and things she never uses that could easily be tidied away or thrown out if she wanted to give the cat more freedom. Or plants she keep buying even though she knows he will probably just knock more over.  He is such a lovely cat, very gentle when he is calm, he loves pets and attention and is really quite intelligent. I have been looking after him while she is away with instructions to feed him twice a day and put him back in the cage whenever I'm done. It just feels so wrong. I have played with him when I can and let him roam the house but he tried to jump out a barely open window in the 2nd floor, which just kind of shows how desperate he is to explore and have more freedom.  She does care for this cat but I am worried she is just using him as an emotional support without fully having the capacity to look after him well enough. He is a bit overweight and she spoils him with treats (like over Christmas he had 4 advent calenders) but he clearly isn't getting enough excercise. Her mental health is not good and she got him straight after her previous cat died so I want to approach this gently but firmly with her. I'm not sure what to say. Also when she takes him to her parents home, the cat is suddenly in a multiple cat household (although they all get along apparently) and allowed to roam for the most part. But she and the vet believe this is where his injury came from (fox bite) and I'm sure it must be very unstable for him going between the two: from extreme freedom to caged life. When she is home he can be out of his cage, but again just in one room and I often hear her telling him off because he just gets overstimulated and runs around.  What do I say to her that won't break our friendship but ensure this cat gets better treatment? ",

        "selftext": "My (19f) friends and I all decided to go on a ski trip for a 12 days over winter break. We found a place to stay and all in all it was around $600 per person for the rental and we decided it was just easiest to have one person (me) put all the money upfront and just everyone pay me back before the actual trip, which everyone did. In my friend group we have a girl let\u2019s call Sarah. Sarah comes from a comfortable family and was even one of the people who suggested the trip and was one of the leading forces to finding the Air Bnb. Literally in the weeks leading up to the trip we were all fine, sending outfit ideas, restaurants to books etc. the Tuesday before we left (Saturday) Sarah starts sending texts to the gc like \u201cguys Jacob\u2019s (boyfriend) family is going to xxxxx next week\u201d basically sending us a LOT of details about where his family is going for winter vacation that we didn\u2019t really need to know. Then on Thursday (again we leave on Saturday) she texts the gc saying how she couldn\u2019t go because she had a family emergency, said her grandma had gotten admitted to the hospital . We were obviously bummed but family comes first and I told her that I would send her the money back that she sent towards the rental. We go on the trip and everything is ok until one of my friends who has Sarah\u2019s location on Life360 (roommates) sees that she\u2019s in a beach town and we put 2 and 2 together. We spend that night pissed and we call her out the next day where she admits everything. She had been last minute invited on her boyfriend\u2019s vacation and decided that she wanted to go to that instead but didn\u2019t know how to tell us. We were all obviously hurt and upset that she would choose a boy over us but at the end of the day she\u2019s a 19 year old girl so I guess it\u2019s just immaturity. The part that I\u2019m wondering if I\u2019m the asshole with is that after finding out that she voluntarily pulled out of the trip, I had told her I wouldn\u2019t be refunding her the $600 she had sent me for the rental. She pulled out so last minute that we couldn\u2019t find anything cheaper and I said I was ok just wasting that money because again I thought she was having a family emergency. After finding out that she wouldn\u2019t be getting that back she went insane and started calling me a bad friend and everything. My parents think I should send it back to her but I don\u2019t see why I should, she pulled out because of her boyfriend and expected us to all just absorb the costs?? ",

        "selftext": "We're both Africans staying in India. I'm a student but she's working here. We both stay in the same pg house and our landlord is super friendly and very kind. He's also a part of this.  So my friend (25f) borrowed 12000rs (approx.135usd) from her two old workmates from Zimbabwe last year and they told her there will 100% be no interest and only has to return the 12000rs. She really needed it at the time and although she's still struggling right now,  she was finally able to find the 12000rs back. However in order to get it, she had to give her passport as collateral.  The issue now is that she's trying to give the workmates their money but they're refusing the 12000rs. They want 18000rs (approx 205usd). She told me and I suggested options but she's already done that. The only way she could give them the full 18000rs they're demanding is by getting the passport, opening a bank account, receiving her paycheck as they want her to specifically have this bank give the people their money and she has her passport. But they've refused. They want the full money right then and there and have told her they don't care what happens to her or her passport and if she doesn't want it, they don't care but she's not getting it back until she pays them. So she went to our landlord who is willing to help her request politely for the passport back and to give the original 12000rs and if they refuse, to involve police. But the landlord wants me to go with them. I don't want to go because I'm not sure of what could happen and I'm just a student. I dont want anything bad to happen to me. It could be dangerous. So I told my friend this and she was ok with it. However, I did tell her to be very careful herself when going with the landlord as we don't know how people actually are and they could both be harmed. That they should meet with them in a safe public space and should record the conversation. And that it could become a very dangerous situation because as she told me before, they're people who can be very aggressive and don't care for consequences. I told her all this and she laughed at me. Said I wasn't being serious and it's just me thinking childishly and that Africans are actually scared of Indians.  I told her it really doesn't matter who is afraid of who and anything could happen. She just shut me off and told me to stop talking about it. I apologized and she angrily just told me to stop talking about it again and that it doesn't concern me anymore and to leave. She says nothing could ever happen to her. I just wanted her to be safe and I'm not sure if that was the right moment to tell her that. Was I in the wrong or not to tell her that?  I",

And now my dad is getting a bunch of hate from all of my family about how I'm such an evil person for not giving my aunt money that I didn't know what she was going to use it for.. here's all that happened and why i cut contact and refuse to give her the money:  I had a house fire when I was 12, i lost my mother and brother in it,, the house that burnt down my parents didnt own that house, my aunt bought it, my parents paid rent plus all the bills, my aunt didnt get house insurance (WE THOUGHT SHE DID) so we got no money nor the Decision to keep the house up, During this time my dad was in surgery, so he was healing at the hospital  I went to go live with The aunt who had bought the house for us, That same aunt tried stealing me from my dad As in trying to get custody over me she lost, after my dad got out of the hospital we went and lived with a different aunt, we had my other other aunt start a gofund me, we raised alot of money but the aunt who started it stole most of the money from it, only giving my dad half, when we found out we moved from my other aunts house to an Apartment, we moved to a house we're I moved out, I'm in college I live in the Dormitory, So with All this being said, AITA? Edit: The reason why my dad hasn't cut ties is because he's worried it will backfire on him, and he wants our family to be able to ask him for help. the reason why my aunt came to me for money is because I was a rug (I let people walk all over me because i felt no self worth) when I was 12-18, and because I hadn't talked to her in two years she thought I'd still be easily manipulated and the same. Edit 2: My dad is telling me I either give her the money or he cuts contact with me? He's choosing his sister who stole from us rather than me, his only daughter. My older brothers are saying just cut him off and ignore him till he comes back to reality... I might have to give in on the money, I don't want to lose my dad... I don't have enough money, I'm thinking of working overtime at my job and selling some of my artwork... I'm not sure what to do.. I can't believe he's doing this because of family's family. I get that, but she's no family of mine, and I owe her nothing. Edit 3: I'm not giving in, I texted my dad telling him you need to come back to reality, your siding with a snake who stole from us after losing my mom and brother. Then I blocked him on everything.",

        "selftext": " So me and my sister, we get along pretty well. We spend every day together and my mum is also at home every day when she isn't working. My sister HATES sharing. She refuses to share when told or she will give me something if she feels like it and is in a good mood.  I, on the other hand, will share quite regularly and when told (I'll get to that, it's quite important) and she sort of apprectiates it. If i offer her a bite of my food she'll eat like half of it but I don't mind. I'll only tell her absolutely no if it's something special or something I really want.  Now my mum. My sister has a very demanding personality and my mum is more gentle. That leads to my sister being dominating of my mum so she gets what she wants a lot. My mum enables that, so when I tell her no to having, say, one of my chocolates, my mum will force me to give my sister what she wants.  Now, today. So I got a present from my sister, it was a Sanrio mystery bag with sparkly tickers. I like Sanrio so I loved it and I decorated my laptop with them, leaving about 8 or 9 stickers left. My sister wanted some but I said no she can just buy some, I don't see why she needs mine. She's been asking non stop for just one sticker but I said no. Tonight, she asked again for stickers so I said, rather frustrated, no Im not giving you a sticker, stop asking me constantly. I said it in a rude way because she has been asking me constantly for more than 2 months. My mum and sister were staring at me with disgust and my mum said are you even Christian anymore? Jesus says to share. She always brings religion into these things so I said yes mum I am, just because I'm not giving her my stuff doesn't mean I'm not Christian.  My sister ended up calling me names and saying I was immature so I said is it mature to not respect no for nearly 2 months?. My mum started getting angry and called me a f**khead turd selfish b***ch and told me that she wouldn't be taking me anywhere. I told her that was manipulative and she responded with I don't give a flying f**k. It went on for a bit longer and yes I was being rude because im sick of it, my sister gets what she wants all the time and she caused this huge drama over one sticker.  Then my sister came in again saying you're nearly 18, you caused all this over a sticker, you're being so rude for nothing. I got annoyed and said you're nearly 16, you won't respect no. I've been repeating over and over. I told her she's been harassing me and I'm sick of it. She keeps saying I only asked you once so I say no, you've asked multiple times over 2 months but then she responds with I meant tonight and it's really annoying that she asking me more than once when I already said no.  My dad is on my side and told them both it doesn't matter, it's her stickers so why should she have to give it to (my sister) but they both keep saying oh she was so rude but my dad sees why I'm so annoyed.  Anyway idk what to do or if I'm wrong,  AITA?",

        "selftext": "Using a throwaway because she uses this subreddit also. Sorry for any typos I wrote this in a rush. Yeah, this is kind of weird, but I needed to ask because I'm autistic and also aroace, so I'm not too great with social stuff, especially for Valentine\u2019s Day, so I was wondering if I was in the wrong here. Recently my (18m) best friend (18f) asked me for some help with making a gift for her boyfriend (again 18m). They\u2019ve been dating for a few months, and her boyfriend and I happen to have similar interests, and I like crafts, so she originally asked me to help her make some matching bracelets for them, which I was super excited to do. I even ordered some new materials to do so since all my bracelet-making stuff has gotten kind of old and brittle. Earlier this week, though, she told me that I wouldn\u2019t have to make them anymore, which was a little sad, but I could still use the materials to make gifts for the rest of our friend group (which I want to be a surprise). Anyways, this is all to say I know she\u2019s planning to give him something on Valentine\u2019s Day. likely handmade since she likes crafts as well. Recently she texted me that she didn\u2019t even want flowers for Valentine\u2019s Day anymore, and when I asked why, she explained that her boyfriend was making it sound like a hassle to get her them. I was pretty upset, but I just told her that it was a weird thing for him to say. I would like to add this is not a thing of flowers being expensive or anything he can very much afford it. He simply doesn\u2019t want to go out of the way to get them for her. Also, she literally had to ask him to make him get her those flowers. Not sure if it was a Valentine's gift in general, but definitely for the flowers. This is where I might be the asshole. I decided to go to the store and buy some construction paper, following a YouTube tutorial I saw to try and make her a paper bouquet. I originally thought it\u2019d be a nice gesture, especially if her boyfriend doesn\u2019t get her the flowers. I don\u2019t have many friends in real life, so I told one of my online friends about it since I didn\u2019t want to spoil the surprise. They ended up scolding me, though, and told me I was overstepping and that it\u2019d be like I was trying to one-up her boyfriend. I didn\u2019t think I was wrong at first, but now I'm conflicted. I don\u2019t want to one up him or anything I just want to make my friend happy. So yeah, would I be the asshole if I gave my best friend a paper bouquet for Valentine\u2019s Day? EDIT: Forgot to say it\u2019s normal for the two of us to give each other gifts on Valentine\u2019s Day. We\u2019ve been doing it ever since we were kids I\u2019m talking about the specific gift because I\u2019m going to be giving her something no matter what.",

I didn't know due to not being on my phone, around 9:15-9:35 I was called & texted by A(18 M). me & A were in a MC dino server where I had 1 dino. & while gone, my dino starved & died. Now around 11 I finishedwatching the movies & checked my phone, where I was met with texts & calls from A. I called, wondering what happened to my dino. I was then met w/ a bitch tone. After they had told me of my dinos death, INGAME, They hung up after silence. So after a bit I called back & I was met with nada. They denied the call after a few seconds. I went to discord asking to answer the phone. Now atp I was upset bc theyre rude for no reason! I wanted to confront them, after 2 years of taking their BS i was done. I was done being treated shit. They then put me in a GC w/, them & O (18 M). I joined the vc pissed and I admit, I raised my voice a bit. I was interrupted many times during the fight. They left from being upset & O followed. during this I was on Vr with T. S had Left before the 2nd movie ended. We talked and my vr then died So me & T went on a call in dms instead! After talking a bit I went to get my other friend V (20 F)s opinion on the situation. She said that i wasn't in the wrong. i wasn't sure of myself. Me & T stayed on call chatting on wht to do. I looked @ my call history, texts, & texted my online dad to get Info. During the fight A Said they had Called me within 3 hours. Now after checking Texts & call history it was more of a 20-30 min time period. I was rightfully upset & then texted another friend. He had been on the dino server a lot more then me and A. I asked him if in the Mod we were able to feed other peoples dinos. He said yes. I took the SS and T into a call with A & O. I talked to A saying how they were wrong & that if i seem like an AHole then im sorry. They again kept interrupting me & saying i was being an AHoleA then left the call. I,Upset, due to all of this being dumb spoke to O asking their thoughts. O said i was An AHole in the 1st vc w/ them & A. They Told  A's side & my past response to them not replying soon, & then getting upset for not texting back ASAP.  Which I said was wrong & made them upset. O left the call after some banter. Me & T stayed in the call talking & saying how i was rly not being an AHole & then talked about random things. later O & A joined back. This time A had me \u2018muted\u2019 & O was silent. I asked why they had joined back and O said they were worried about T. Both me & T were confused because they had no reason to be worried? We talked some more, i got mad. I talked to O & T was quiet. I said how i was done w/ A\u2019s BS & how they do this each time a fight similar would take place. We talked & eventually T Msg me in dms that O was ab to have a panic attack. both T & O left, since they shouldn't be involved and it should be between me & A.i tried talking to A & They left.",

        "selftext": "Hey Reddit, I\u2019m a 36-year-old dealing with some unresolved family and financial issues from my past, and I need your perspective. The Backstory:I worked full time at my parents\u2019 Quiznos for about five years. Based on the minimum wage rates during those years (assuming 40 hours per week), I should have earned roughly $72K in gross wages. After subtracting partial payments they made\u2014specifically, $600 per month for 4 months (totaling $2,400) while I was in college, plus an extra $400 they gave to cover divorce lawyer fees\u2014I calculated a net claim of around $69,400. Family Dynamics and My Situation:\t\u2022\tI lived with my parents until June 2007. Later, I returned and stayed with them for about half a year before eventually getting kicked out. After that, I ended up moving from couch to couch.\t\u2022\tMy immigration status was a huge issue because my parents never set it up correctly. I ended up with no proper status, and my mom even told me I should have saved money since I was essentially on my own.\t\u2022\tThroughout all of this, my dad never actually paid me what I was owed for the work I did\u2014even though I was working full time and handling responsibilities well beyond just making sandwiches. My Request:Now, after all these years, I\u2019m asking my parents for the back pay I\u2019m owed. I know this might stir up family drama, especially since they own the business, and I\u2019m aware that some might see it as ungrateful. But the fact remains: I worked for them, I wasn\u2019t paid what I was owed, and I\u2019ve been left to deal with the financial fallout for decades. So, AITA for asking my parents for the back pay from my time working at Quiznos? I\u2019d appreciate any thoughts or advice on whether my request is fair given the circumstances. Thanks in advance. \u2014 Conarly  UPDATE So I graduated high school in June of 2006 and started in march of 2006.. I was 17 at the time a minor until November 2006 where I turned 18 .. from November till may I worked almost 72hr due to him getting in an accident.. I then got told to go live in England because me and my dad was having trouble getting along.. I went to England paid by my parents yes.. worked in England moved to Germany and came back a year and a half later.. I was 20 Turning 21 I live with my parents 6 months after that when I was kicked out again..due to standing up for my self asking for some sort of pay or recognition.. without a visa I had no choice but to work for my dad who said he\u2019ll pay me $4 an hour to keep it under the radar of the irs since I was illegally here in the USA.. btw he didn\u2019t pay me the $4 dollars an hour he would make calculations on how I\u2019d be left with a 4 dollar paycheck.. I was living on a friends couch working for my dad and having another job at another Quiznos. Friend kicked me out after 3 weeks after he blamed his pot on me.. I went to another friends house when I stayed on they couch paid rent while working both jobs and barley having anything left over.. I worked for my dad til the age of 23 where I would finally have enough of his abuse and quit. By the way since this time I\u2019ve built myself a pretty good life.. I have worked hard on shredded the verbal and physical abuse that my dad gave me my whole life.. I got married got papers and now have legal immigration status here in the us due to my hard work.. another thing is I am requesting now after all this time is because one.. I don\u2019t like feeling taken advantage without ever being able to get right about the situation.. so I think if I move forward at least pay me for wages when I didn\u2019t live with you and didn\u2019t get to save a thing before you kicked me out without a leg to stand on.. another reason why I\u2019m asking my old employer to pay me is because he couldn\u2019t at the time and that\u2019s the reason he kept giving.. he now came into a life changing amount of money and I\u2019m asking for my wages that\u2019s it\u2019s.. not trying to sue for more than what I didn\u2019t get paid",

        "selftext": "AITA? My (27m) husband and I (26f) have been living together for about 3 years. We have always had a basket in the bathroom for dirty laundry. The entire time we\u2019ve been living together I\u2019m the one who has always done laundry. When the basket gets full I take it to the laundry room and wash everything that\u2019s in it. For the past several months my husband has started leaving his dirty clothes mostly in a pile in the floor in the bedroom instead of putting them in the basket. We\u2019ve had conversations about this several times and he says he\u2019ll make sure to start putting his clothes in the basket, but nothing has really changed. This morning he made a comment about how he has to go to work in dirty clothes. Including dirty socks and underwear. I didn\u2019t say anything because I\u2019ve washed the clothes in the basket and was caught up on laundry. Then he asks me if I could wash his clothes for him so he doesn\u2019t have to go to work in dirty clothes. I told him that I\u2019ll wash his clothes when he puts them in the basket. He got mad and said I was petty for not washing his laundry and that he doesn\u2019t understand why I can\u2019t take 30 more seconds to pick up all his clothes off the floor and wash them. I told him that if it was so easy then why couldn\u2019t he take 30 seconds to pick them up and do it and that I wasn\u2019t his mom and I\u2019m not picking up his dirty clothes off the floor when there\u2019s a basket. According to him I\u2019m a petty asshole and don\u2019t do anything for him because I refuse to pick up his clothes from the floor to wash them. Am I the asshole for not picking up his clothes?",

        "selftext": "I\u2019m a minor living in Korea (an Asian country) with my parents, and I\u2019ve been struggling with my mental health for years. I\u2019m extremely antisocial, easily overstimulated, and I don't have the mental capacity to do pretty much anything that requires time, and it\u2019s only been getting worse. I know I need help. But every time I bring this up to my parents, they tell me I\u2019m exaggerating or just looking for an easy way out. They think I\u2019m lazy, that I just don\u2019t want to study, and they literally told me to my face that I don\u2019t take my future seriously, even though I\u2019ve been telling them about wanting to major in neurology. They've always told me to Study more when you can\u2019t, take a 10-minute break, and you\u2019re just making excuses because you didn\u2019t even try. They told this to me when I was crying and asking them if they could help me with my problems. And honestly, even though I didn't get any support from them and was upset when they told me this, I'm also pretty much convinced that I'm doing things wrong too. Six months ago, I finally convinced them to take me to a psychiatrist to get tested for ADHD. The doctor said I wasn't really ADHD since I was at the borderline, but she noticed strong signs of depression and wanted me to come back for more appointments. My parents didn\u2019t want to spend the money, and honestly, I backed out too because I felt guilty about the cost. The only thing I got was medication, which obviously didn\u2019t help because we never followed up. Since then, things have gotten so much worse, but my parents think that whole experience was a failure and a waste of money. So now, I feel like I can\u2019t ask for help again, even though I feel like I need it. Even though I'm not trying my best to keep things up at the moment, I don't feel like pushing myself further isn't working well, yet giving up makes me feel guilty. I feel like I\u2019d be the asshole for pushing this because:1. We don\u2019t have a lot of income, and I can't even let this stupid boarding school go because it's my 'final year of highschool' and they won't even let me consider it.2. I failed myself the first time3. I know I take a long time to open up. I don't even open up to my parents and they don't even know what my hobbies are (which isn't something weird, it's actually crafting)4. Like what my parents told me, I'm probably not trying my best But at the same time, I don't think I can keep going like this. So, WIBTA if I tried to convince them again?",

I picked her up and dropped her off this weekend. Because of the distance, my tiredness, and honestly, the intimidation of it, I had let the car get bad-messy. She took charge and cleaned it with me, and set a rule where I was not to eat in my car. She forgot her wallet and keys at home, so I drove them to her yesterday (Monday) despite her mom's opinion and some tiredness.  Today, I had a dentist's appointment in the morning and dinner with my friend. I decided to run some errands along the way and hit the gym. I had lent her my headphones when hers broke, so I stopped by and grabbed a cheap temporary/backup pair. So, there were a few receipts and the empty box, plus 5 bags in the backseat. I had forgotten to bring a trash bag for the car and planned clear it at home. While I was eating KBBQ with my friend, she messaged me she needed a hug stat and had half-jokingly mentioned she wanted food from her favorite restaurant. She has panic attacks sometimes, so I always want to make sure she feels supported. I wrapped up the evening within 15 mins. I overate badly, but I walked to my car with my friend, said goodbye, and drove to the restaurant (25 mins). I picked up the order, and drove another hour+ to her university. Parked, and brought the food up to her.  I wasn't planning to drive tonight, so I was exhausted and passed out on the couch next to her while she did some work. We drove to a park we frequent because she wanted to. She wanted to lay down. I asked her if she wanted to return to the dorm and she declined, so we napped.  She woke up and wanted to move to the backseat. She told me to clear the backseat, so I did. Then she told me to raise my seat up and switch to hers. I told her I was gonna put the passenger seat down. She was upset I was talking back to her and wanted to return to the dorm.  While driving back, she told me how my car was already so messy again despite how important it was to her. She mentioned the receipts, the bags I had moved, and the nail file up front (I have a bad nail biting habit). I told her I had no idea I was going to come tonight and was planning to clean the car when I got home. She told me my plans are meaningless because I didn't plan well for her birthday (2 months ago). This is something I have apologized for repeatedly, and have tried to make up to her. I tried to explain that the car would have been clean before we had planned to meet, but I was rushing since she told me she needed me stat. I tried explaining I understood her feelings, and tried validating them while staying firm. Argument continued until she was making preparations to leave. I asked her if she wanted me to walk her back. She declined. I told her I loved her, she said something I didn't hear, and she closed the door hard. AITA?",

Zach also has a son(17), who I\u2019ll call Joe. Joe calls me and Hank uncle, and we both see him as a nephew. Hank is engaged and will be getting married in two months. The issue is Zach and Joe had a massive argument two weeks ago, to the point where Joe moved out of their house and is living with me. I asked them what happened and they both told me the same thing. Zach wants Joe to go to a medical school and become a doctor like him but Joe applied to a law school instead and gained admission. I have encouraged them to talk calmly. Hank, Zach\u2019s sister and I told Joe that if push comes to shove we will help pay for law school. We have enough money between the three of us to pay the tuitions, the costs of textbooks and the food, should his dad refuse to support him. But he should also give thought to talking to his dad. Their last conversation was basically a shouting match. We also told Zach that pressuring Joe to pursue a career he isn\u2019t interested in will only damage their relationship but he insisted on it, saying three generations of his family have been doctors and he doesn\u2019t want his son to be a \u2018bloodsucker.\u2019 Hank is worried that one of them might skip his wedding to avoid the other and asked me to help them reconcile since I\u2019ve known Zach longer.

He laughed too. I laughed especially hard because I was high. In the moment I realized I might have laughed too much and might make him feel bad so I said that I wasn\u2019t laughing at him but with him, and tried to help him do the dance move and encourage him. This morning he tells me he went to bed feeling bad about himself and woke up feeling bad because I was laughing at him. I said that I was really sorry for that and that I was laughing with him, we were laughing together. I start to state my experience of the situation. He goes on saying that the way I laughed I seemed to enjoy it way too much, and that he can tell when he\u2019s being made fun of and apparently the only reason he laughed was because he felt awkward. He starts to get angry and I admit that I was technically laughing at him a little because it did looked funny and silly but that it was confusing because he had laughed as well.  He then starts to rant about how I let my ego get in the way of being loving and nurturing, that\u2019s why I couldn\u2019t control myself laughing at him to begin with and how I\u2019m a liar who does not take accountability and makes the situation about me when he was trying to share his feelings with me. Honestly I was high and it was just really fucking funny, but I wasn\u2019t making fun of him by laughing it was just my honest reaction in the moment. I was technically not honest in the beginning about laughing at him because I was high when it happened and it was objectively funny in general so I was confused if you could really classify me laughing intentionally at him. I do feel bad he felt the way he did because how I reacted and now it turned into a huge fight. He\u2019s calling me names and is stating I am making him do that because I\u2019m frustrating him and a liar who lets my ego control my reactions and behaviors. ",

Now, my sister(26) had to take up all the responsibilities right after school, she started teaching at a local school and since then She has been teaching and managing all our household expenses. Other than that, we also took up tutoring, and since then I've also been a part time tutor (we run an academy at our place). Now, she has recently started her ... business like in the last week only, we came up with the recipe, name, logo, planning, packaging everything. I have a younger brother too (18) and he helps in almost all things we do, like we used to work as home tutors and he would pick and drop us with zero complaints whatsoever, and his role is much more than just that. It is just that he is in his first year of grad and hasn't started working yet. Now the problem is, she has been a little weird since long, like maybe months. Like, she's always acting like I'm doing everything and all that. While we totally understand that it is a huge deal that she had quit her passion and do things that she didn't want to do and has been managing everything since forever and there's like zero appreciation from my dad for her, he still picks fights with her all the time. But we've always stood for her. No matter what. We've always appreciated her. We've always shown our gratitude towards her for the smallest of things. Because we genuinely are. Having said that, it sometimes feels unfair. Because my life wasn't as hard as hers, but even I have been tutoring since I was in Grade 9 and haven't stopped ever since. She  never seems to acknowledge any of that not does she consider it important to ever appreciate us for what we do. My brother was 16 when he had to take up responsibilities that he shouldn't have taken. But she does not care to appreciate him. Furthermore, she goes on to take us for granted and even belittle him sometimes. Now post this startup, she is like my business, my efforts, my company, my brand all the time while my brother is also working very hard for the brand. But she's like you need to get this done and like she's entitled for it but also goes on to say that I'm the only one working hard for it. I feel like telling her that she's not only being arrogant but also straight up discrediting him for his work. Please tell what to do. Sorry for the long post",

Well about six months ago I was kicked out of my house by abusive parents who told me I had to choose between being my own person and getting to live there. Thankfully a friend's family took me in and things have been so much better since, but I had to leave my car with my sister at home because there's no room for him here and he's very shy. I'll probably never get him back since my sister loves him so much and my parents decided to help pay for him since I left, so he's happier and better taken care of than I could ever offer him. I just feel so horrible missing his sweet fuzzy face that used to wake me up in the mornings and the first bit of real family I had to call my own. There's nothing to be done about it I guess, unless I want to subject myself to abuse again (I know it's not worth it) but I don't know how to deal with leaving him, or the amount I miss him even though he is less than ten minutes away by care. So what do I do? Or am I the asshole for leaving him forever????",

        "selftext": "30M here with 27F GF- 3 months dating.  I was talking about my life to my partner about my career and how it got to be where it was because she didn\u2019t understand how I can have debts on a high salary. (Ex director, now a property development manager/managing quantity surveyor) I explained that the debts where from my previous LTD company (a construction company doing around 500k per annum with 6 employees), I explained that I closed the company because I could manage it on my own after my main foreman left to go to Australia. She said \u201cyou just need to manage your time better and employ people who manage themselves\u201d. I hadn\u2019t explained all the details around everything but I felt like she was making a suggestion about my competence.  I explained there wasn\u2019t enough time in the day to get everything done and she said you don\u2019t need to be on site all day and then a quote only takes an hour and that obviously it was something I was doing wrong because her dad has a construction company that she helped \u201crun\u201d for 6 months. I laughed and said a quote doesn\u2019t take an hour. She responds \u201cyeah you just need to work smarter\u201d.  Is it wrong to find this incredibly condescending? Her profession is a police officer and I said it\u2019s not like she is a manager or senior management which she argued against and said being a police officer is a manager. She then said that I had a failed business. I explained you\u2019re suggesting I\u2019m a failure and that I am bad with my timekeeping, bad at delegation and hiring, and generally a failure. She argued she isn\u2019t implying I\u2019m a failure but says that the business is a failure as a fact.  I said the business could have continue to run but I decided I didn\u2019t want to pursue it anymore how does that make it a failure? It closed, it didn\u2019t liquidate. She said \u201cif an actor stops acting he\u2019s a failed actor\u201d I said \u201cno if he was successful and then voluntarily quit, he is still successful\u201d.  I didn\u2019t fail at business, it wasn\u2019t making the money that I wanted it to make for the time and risk investment required. She said why does it matter it\u2019s nothing to do with your life it\u2019s in the past and it did fail and you could have improved your time management etc. I stated \u201cyou can use a blanket statement like work smarter and apply that to even the most successful business\u201d. She said \u201cit was advice you don\u2019t need to have a hurt ego\u201d, I said \u201cI was talking retrospectively and I didn\u2019t need advise and I would never say this to anyone about their business, if someone has invested years of their life into a business for you to call it a failure is a slap in the face and just unnecessary and that you should be supportive and should have just said something like sometimes these things don\u2019t work out.  Do I just have a fragile ego? Or am I right in thinking the use of these negative descriptive words shouldn\u2019t be used in a relationship? I\u2019m unsure if I\u2019ve overreacted because I\u2019ve told her that I don\u2019t think she respects me or my opinion.",

        "selftext": " So a year my brother in law (m47)was kicked out of his house by his now ex wife and he tried to harm himself severely. He realised his mistake called 999 and got the help he needed which included being sectioned. Now we where never really part of his life before this but being my husbands brother we offered a roof over his head once he was released on condition he got back on his feet to a position where he could solely support himself so he could move out. His mental health was severe so I supported him throughout that then he started getting better on the right medication and got a job but after a month he was sacked so he got another job but was sacked from that because he had a lot of sick days and since then (september) he has made no attempt to better himself he stayed in his room in bed all day then started drinking again every night but kept it at a limit he wasnt showering or taking care of his basic hygiene needs and it started to get to a point he was lying to us for a reason to drink like he was meeting friends or lady's which turned out he was just going the pub and getting sloshed on his own. Then 2 weeks ago he offered to pick me up from work but he went the pub at 1pm I finished in the evening so I messaged and said not to bother picking me up i'll get the bus. He kicked off and went awol we reported him missing because of his recent mental health he could have done anything to himself. But then after being missing from 6pm he appeared the next morning at 8am he said he slept rough. I believe he did this because I no longer wanted a lift and it was Punishment to me but I didn't want to get in a car with him driving if he had been drinking. Which I explained but he just though I was an ass hole. He then didn't drink for the rest of the week until Saturday. He was drinking in the evening me and my husband and child went to bed and left him I got a notification on my ring door bell he snuck out the house to buy more beer at 2.40am then again at 8am he went out to but more so at this point we was all awake and he was still up in The kitchen drinking my son had seen him in this drunken state and I was furious he allowed that to happen as I have shielded my son from actions this whole past year until then. So I told my brother in law that it's inappropriate to be in that state at 9.30 in the morning in front of his nephew and that I'd had enough and told him he needed to go bed and sleep it off he refused so I told him to GTFO he huffed like child and took himself to bed. Once he sobered up I told him that he has been here a year and the condition of staying here was that he was to get back on his feet and that he is now in a no better situation now than he was a year ago and that I have spent a year trying to help him get a job save money so he could move out on his own but as that's not happened and he is falling back into oblivion that a change a scenery will be best as we can no longer house him or support his life choices because it's affecting my marriage.",

        "selftext": "Flashback to a few months ago, (October/November?), I told my roommate (let\u2019s call him Chris) I was considering moving out at the end of the lease with a mutual friend, but that I hadn\u2019t made up my mind at that point. A few months passed and we didn\u2019t really talk about future living arrangements again. Our current lease stated that we must give the landlord at least 60 days notice about whether we planned to renew the lease or move out, which we did. In the days leading up to that, we then discussed whether or not we wanted to stay in the unit, and we both agreed that we didn\u2019t want to stay in the unit. I explicitly asked him whether he wanted to stay in the unit, to which he said no, and since I told him I didn\u2019t plan to stay either we submitted to the landlord that we planned to not renew the lease. Another 3 weeks went by and we didn\u2019t talk about living arrangements until tonight. It was only when my soon-to-be future roommate (let\u2019s call him Andrew) joked over a dinner both Chris and I were invited to about our new apartment did he ask me what Andrew meant. I talked to him tonight, 41 days before the lease end date, about what my plans were and he is furious that we didn\u2019t have this conversation before the vacate notice deadline. He told me he is upset since I took away his choice to stay in the apartment, since it has already been leased to a new tenant so now he has to move and his new apartment may be more expensive than the current one (there are no available units in our complex that would work with our weird lease end date).",

I have told him before that I don\u2019t want to cut his hair, I have done it before and it\u2019s never something he ends up liking. Since the last time I cut it I told him, I am not going to cut your hair to avoid any issues. It\u2019s been months since his last hair cut, I have told him before to go look for someone professional to cut his hair, he refuses to look and drive far to get a hair cut. All the other times I have had to find a place for him to get his hair cut and sometimes the people that cut his hair he doesn\u2019t want to go back to either because of bad service or he ended up getting cut (ex. The back of his neck nipped) and I understand some reasons but I have told him to look for someone he would like to go see if he should check it out. Well last time I cut it, it was to long it wasn\u2019t what he wanted, this time it was to short. I am not a professional, this isn\u2019t a hobby I want to do this isn\u2019t something. I don\u2019t know how to cut hair and I really didn\u2019t want to do it the reason I did it this time was because we are low on money and can\u2019t pay anyone to cut his hair we barely have enough for food atm, I have also told him that he should cut his hair so I don\u2019t have but he hasn\u2019t tried. So I want to know AITAP.S. I didn\u2019t mean to cut his hair to short he claims I did it on purpose. When I told him I was trying to get it even.Edit; I take back that he hasn\u2019t cut his hair, he did it once and messed up bad, he was frustrated that I was to slow (first time cutting his hair) and he got the clippers and started to cut his own hair, safety guard fell off in the process and from then on hasn\u2019t tried to cut his hair because he had to go bald that time and still got upset with me for being to slow.",

        "selftext": "So for some context, I'm going into my 2nd semester in my 4 bedroom apartment, I had 4 roommates, but two moved out when the 2nd semester started, and one additional roommate moved in. It hasn't been verified but this guy is clearly autistic, but so was the roommate he replaced but we never had any issues with him.Anyways I DEEP cleaned the main areas before he moved in, and within the week after it was trashed. Milk was constantly being left out, he was taking dirty dishes OUT of the sink and spreading them across the counter spaces. On top of that he REFUSED to talk to or even look at us.Me and my other roommate got tired of this and we warned him if he keeps leaving all his stuff out, we were just going to start putting his stuff in his room for him to deal with. For the most part things got better, but he was still leaving stuff out a LOT. It was just usually taken care of by the end of the day.But one day, I noticed an OPEN jar of mayo, an OPEN pack of cheese, and an OPEN pack of ham. We don't share stuff like that so I just shrugged it off because I was in a rush to go to my girlfriend's place. I actually messaged him about it, and I said he needed to put it up, and if he didn't he was going to get sick. Well going into the third day, it was still there. He wasn't, and his door was wide open, so I closed the items, put it on his desk and walked out.THREE days later, he comes to me and says did you go into my room and put this stuff here? My room is a barrier that I want to be respected this is the first time if heard him say this and I did feel bad for doing it, but to my knowledge we were all on the same page.One random story I have of him that's kinda the same topic... he half cooked a chicken, turned off the pan, and went to class... he just... left the chicken... half cooked idk I thought that one was gross",

I have epilepsy and no medication, i panic and don't think much of the missed bus stop, sometimes it happens, i figure it's no big deal. i figure i'd get another bus back. all i can think of is how much time i have left to get my medication. the bus driver pulled me aside at the next stop, yells at me, and says that i missed the bus stop on purpose, i said i'd pay the difference, but he says he can't do that. i don't know what to say. i said I'm sorry but you were going so fast and i saw my pharmacy was closed, i panicked and was looking for open pharmacies on google.  i figure i'd get another bus into town to get an emergency prescription, lo and behold, same bus driver. he says to me, and i quote, you have some nerve getting onto my bus again. i looked at him and said i said i would pay the difference. he goes you know you can't. i said i'll pay it right now, add it on to my ticket i'm paying for. he sighs, shakes his head, and then calls me a liar and a cheater. it is a 40p difference in ticket by the way. i told him he was being unnecessarily hostile and rude and i left before it turned into a yelling match because he just seemed in the mood to pick fights, i went upstairs.  he proceeds to rant about me to another man who asked what happened so loudly that the entire bus can hear, he calls me a liar and a cheater again. tells the man i swindled him on purpose because i missed my bus stop, and cost the bus company 40p.  am i the asshole? i am genuinely unsure because his reaction was so severe it made me feel like i'd done something wrong.

He sends me pics of himself, his pets and siblings, and pics from his day. The only problem was that he would always be secretive and probably paranoid, since it was online. But him being secretive only made me paranoid, since I don\u2019t really talk to people that I meet online.  Basically, Whenever I would ask his name he would dodge the question and then about a week later he finally told me his name. He says he doesn\u2019t have any other social media, which I didn\u2019t mind (for the longest time I only had snap, so there was no judgement), His snap score was 900 (be for real\u2026 your a 20 year old attractive man, yk that snap score is higher than that) , he would often dodge calls, and basically while he would let me know about his days and send pics\u2026 I didn\u2019t know ANYTHING about this dude. At this point, I was super paranoid that I\u2019m being catfished or something  After 2 months of talking, and him constantly avoiding my questions but asking me questions about my personal life, I got kinda mad. So basically, I had asked him a question about his job, because I was curious , and he changes the subject. I asked again and he changed the subject again. So I asked \u201cwhy don\u2019t you wanna tell me??\u201d and he says \u201cwhat do u mean?\u201d so i tell him how i felt and basically to summarize it: \u201cWhy do you always avoid my questions or act weird about it? I ask you a question, you will change the subject but when I don\u2019t wanna answer a question, you will beg for me to answer. It is hypocritical and makes me feel a little bit weird and uneasy. I don\u2019t wanna be rude but we have been friends for 2 months and you still won\u2019t tell me anything.\u201d (copy n pasted from the chat btw) I thought the short paragraph was really mature but he didn\u2019t really like it. He told me that basically, he\u2019s paranoid online and that i\u2019m a b***h for saying that and not respecting his boundaries, even though no boundaries were ever set.  I can kinda see where I was in the wrong because maybe I didn\u2019t give him enough time to get comfortable and calling him a hypocrite might have been harsh. He blocked me and I guess I really wanna know if I was wrong for that. ",

Originally my bf said he did not care whether we did anything or not so I took it upon myself to plan a date I had suggested dinner a spa and possibly a hotel. However some of the plans changed and we decided to no longer go out of town to the dinner and opted to stay in our hometown for date night. Because of this I didn\u2019t see the need for the hotel anymore as I didn\u2019t find it reasonable to spend 200 dollars plus on a hotel where I already live and can sleep in for free. I didn\u2019t put money aside for the hotel anymore and instead decided I would cover the spa and my bf would just cover dinner so it\u2019s even( we agreed prior we were going to split the date).  When I told my bf about this he flipped out on me completely he was so angry at me for changing the plans on him. He\u2019s treating me like I\u2019m a terrible person because I didn\u2019t want to put the money aside for something I felt wasn\u2019t worth it in my opinion especially when I needed that money to pay an important bill. Instead of being understanding like I thought he would be he decided to say he no longer wants to do any kind of date at all whether I paid or not and that suddenly he was too broke to take me out ever again. I even offered to do a rain check on the hotel thing and it still wasn\u2019t good enough for him and he insists on not doing anything at all for our anniversary.AITAH for this? ",

And when I told step mom I wasn\u2019t comfortable with my daughter going alone with her she lost her mind. She is claiming I am robbing her of this amazing expirence out of jealously. I feel as if she is buying her affection and overstepping every parenting boundary there is under the sun. And completely disregarding my parenting decisions and disrespecting me as mom.  Ex supports daughter traveling with her alone and has basically washed his hands of the argument. She is ready to bring this to a court to force my hand. I hate this. I am not ok with my 13 year old dictating travel plans with out my input or censent.  Everything in me says this is not a good idea. I don\u2019t trust step mom, and I don\u2019t trust air travel right now  and with the state of the world I don\u2019t think traveling with out bio parent is a good idea.  So AITA?  ",

        "selftext": "So my mum met someone online who she started dating and seeing at his house. he doesn\u2019t drive so my mum has to drive him everywhere all the time. And one day he just got the train to our house us when me and my brothers practically don\u2019t even know him (a literal stranger). And he hasn\u2019t gone home because he\u2019s relying on my mum to take him because his house is 4 hours away and he doesn\u2019t want to get a train and always finds excuses why he can\u2019t go home. He\u2019s made it pretty clear he basically wants to live here. He doesn\u2019t bring anything to the table, I work doing cleaning and my mum works as a teacher. He literally does nothing, he has no job and sleeps till 3pm every single day he never goes shopping and he never leaves my mums side. I feel like he doesn\u2019t let my mum be alone with me for 2 minutes and I haven\u2019t had a conversation with her in 4 months because whenever I\u2019m about to speak to her he always asks her to go out (and my mum has to pay). He always says things about me to her to try and turn her against me. I just want him to go home. He never cooks and always waits till I\u2019m cooking and he comes into the kitchen whenever I am and eats what I\u2019ve made and when I buy my own shopping with my own money he goes downstairs in the middle of the night and eats it. I just want this guy to go home but whenever I ask my mum to take him she just won\u2019t. I don\u2019t know what to do. He doesn\u2019t even respect her and doesn\u2019t pay her anything when me and my brothers do. I can\u2019t stand being here. When my mums out he just stays around and doesn\u2019t leave the house and I just feel so uncomfortable and hate sitting in my room all the time because I don\u2019t want to be around some guy I barely know. He\u2019s said multiple things to her I don\u2019t like too like telling her she should change her hair colour and says certain perfumes she wears don\u2019t smell nice and just little comments all the time that aren\u2019t nice. My mums aware that he doesn\u2019t do anything but she still doesn\u2019t say anything. I just want better for my mum and I just want to be able to spend at least 20 minutes with her it\u2019s like he\u2019s completely isolated her from me and I don\u2019t understand whyOh and he was also at ours for my mums birthday and I didn\u2019t plan anything for me and my mum because I assumed he would do something with her but he never took her out or did anything special for her and only got her a card on the morning of her birthdayAlso let me and my brothers pay for a pizza for her and didn\u2019t chip in anything",

We\u2019ve been working on a major research project, and while we were supposed to have made a lot more progress by now, my group has been doing the most basic parts of the work. My group has been kind of a mess, with me being the youngest (just turned 17 in september), and the oldest being 21 (M). Everything was going fine until recently. I had been working hard, staying up late to meet the deadline, making sure all the research and papers were in order. I even reached out to validators to ensure everything was accurate. It seemed like we were on track. But then, my groupmate\u2019s grandmother\u2014who isn\u2019t even involved in the project\u2014decided to talk to the teacher. She claimed that I was making her granddaughter's life harder, saying that she doesn't get enough sleep and that it was my fault. She even went as far as saying that I \u201cordered\u201d her granddaughter to do all the work. Honestly, I was in shock. Last time I checked, the groupmate (18 F) barely showed up to meetings and was often out with her friends at the arcade. Meanwhile, I had bags under my eyes from staying up late working on everything. When my teacher asked about the situation, they were confused because I was always the one doing the work. The teacher even asked if my groupmate had contributed at all, and all I could say was \u201cI guess\u201d because I honestly didn\u2019t know how else to respond. I just stayed silent the rest of the day. After that incident, I stopped working with the group altogether and started helping other groups instead. I don\u2019t feel like putting in any more effort when they don\u2019t even acknowledge what I\u2019ve done. So now, the rest of the group is behind, and they\u2019re upset with me for not helping anymore. AITA for refusing to help my group after what happened with my groupmate\u2019s grandma?",

During COVID 19 lockdown they shifted to online platform but reverted to physical classes as soon as things got better while other institutions adopted a hybrid model which is going on till now. So they had to shut down his company because he was in loss since a year. I was talking to my father about the situation I told him that he had to shut it down due to his own overconfidence that everyone will prefer his institute because of the brand he had built over the years and lack of understanding that students found hybrid model to be more comfortable now and he should have shifted to that.

I have been dating my girlfriend for just over two years. However, prior to meeting my girlfriend, I was married/dating to my ex for almost 10 years. We were high school sweethearts, but ended up divorcing about 4 years ago. The divorce wasn\u2019t bad, but it was a divorce so it wasn\u2019t easy by any means. Anyways, my ex and I were back in my hometown about three weeks ago to visit family, as we weren\u2019t able to be home for Christmas. Naturally I took her around town, met some of my old buddies, and we ended up at the local brewery. We were there talking and having a good time, when I noticed my ex at a table with her new husband at a table on the other side of the brewery. We made eye contact, so I simply smiled and lifted my beer in a \u201ccheers\u201d motion to her, and she did the same. I never left my seat or even thought about it. My girlfriend saw me do this, and noticed who it was too, and kept talking to my buddies. Didn\u2019t think anything of it. Well we got home that evening and I got torn a new one\u2026how dare I do that in front of her and disrespect her. I responded that it was simply acknowledging her and nothing more! That didn\u2019t seem to help my case, so I was told to sleep in the spare bedroom. My buddies are split, with some telling me that my girlfriend is way overreacting, but others saying I\u2019m an idiot for doing what I did.

My wife (we are late 30s) has been going through some mental health issues and is has grown very codependent with me taking care of most everything in the household.  She will not travel for this funeral due to some social anxieties as well as fears and personal convictions about the current American climate and where the funeral will be.  I respect her decision not to travel but still intend to go to my brothers funeral.  I would be gone for 48 hours and set up everything for her and our child to be self sufficient while I am gone. I would never be unavailable in event of emergency. This is not a pleasure trip but one I feel a duty to complete.  She has become angry about my going stating that I have not prepared the family for an emergency like this and that I have not supported her or acknowledged her needs and fears in this when I feel like I have. She feels that I should put our relationship and needs above all else at all times and I am being unreasonable pushing for this trip when it could cause her emotional harm.  I fully realize that I could be the asshole in this situation and should be more worried about the family I have created than the family I came from. I do not want to scare or hurt my wife but this is very important to me and I should clarify that she is physically capable of managing the house while I am gone only scared to do so and very anxious. She has declined me having a member of her family visit or taking her and our child to that member of family and called it \u201cdumping her off\u201d.  I need some disinterested opinions on the matter before I ruin my family for a trip or regret forever the trip I didn\u2019t take. ",

        "selftext": "TL;DR my wife\u2019s mother told her that she and her dad may not be able to go on our trip, so now she wants to cancel the whole thing. I told her that even if it gets down to just her, our child, and I, we could still have a great time and make great memories. This has turned into a major fight now. I\u2019m on a throwaway because I have family on Reddit and they like this sub. My wife and I randomly and recently decided to plan a rather large vacation that would involve us (wife, child, and I) and bout of our parents. The dates were not set, but we had a general idea of when we wanted to go. I work in a job that isn\u2019t the easiest to get time off with, so I started getting the ball rolling on my end of things to make it easier for when I do have dates. This included changing and planning ConEd dates to allow for the possible window we would be going. Not a problem, just trying to make sure there are no hiccups when more concrete details come through. The other day, she tells me that due to some changes (nothing medical or financial), her parents may not be able to go with us. That soured her mood entirely about the whole thing. She became despondent and finally said that she thinks we just shouldn\u2019t go. I told her that I was sorry about her parents not being able to go, but that shouldn\u2019t stop us from going, even if my parents couldn\u2019t go either. This would be our first family vacation with our child and it would be a chance to make some special memories, especially since he will be about 2 by the time we go. She got quiet and eventually just said good night and walked away. Later on, she texts me about how upset she is by what I have said and that she does not want to talk about this until she is ready because she doesn\u2019t want to say things she doesn\u2019t mean. I have my own opinions about that, but I respected her wishes. I told her that it was not my intention to upset her and that I was sorry that I had.  I just want to know if I am being an asshole because I don\u2019t think we should cancel this trip over one cancellation? I saw this more in the light of it being focused on the three of us, but it seems like she was more interested in having her parents go than even letting our child have this opportunity. ",

However, lately her and her boyfriend (19 m) have been having some issues. I never liked her boyfriend to begin with, and my friend has always known that. Him and I have had our fair share of screaming matches since they got together and if I lacked the impulse control we probably still would. One thing I noticed when him and I would have these screaming matches is that he would tell me things that my friend hadn't told me.  Last week she called me at 7:00 AM to complain to me about her boyfriend for what felt like the hundredth time. I was sick at the time so hadn't been getting much sleep but looking back at it I honestly don't regret a word I said. I'll write how the conversation went but I will use fake names for privacy and respect. Me: Hey, I'm still pretty sick so I'm really tired right now, is everything alright?  Kayla: *sobbing* Dominic is being so mean right now, we were supposed to meet for coffee but we got into a fight this morning and now he won't talk to me  Me: Kayla just give it some time, try to breath and maybe you two can go for coffee tomorrow or do something later  Kayla: I don't wanna do it tomorrow I wanna do it today!  Me: I know, but Kayla I've tried to tell you before that when you two get like this it's not healthy and you both just need to give each other some space.  Kayla: This is so stupid, I don't get why he's like this  Me: I've tried to tell you multiple times that I honestly don't think you guys are right for each other, you call me like this almost every other day  Kayla: No I love him, we're just having a tough time right now.  Me: Kayla I'm sorry but I'm sick of this, you call me like this all the time for advice and you never listen. I've tried to help you multiple times but clearly you don't want help, you just want to complain and I'm not the person you should do that to. I've been way to stressed right now to deal with dumb things like these and you know it. I can't control you but I've tried to give you advice so many times, so if you don't wanna listen then I'm not going to either. You can take my advice or don't talk to me about him anymore.  Then she hung up the phone but I was to tired and to sick to care. I texted her later in the day apologizing for being so harsh but I told her my point still stands. She didn't respond so I left it at that but I've tried to text or talk to her about unrelated things and she's still ignoring me. AITA?",

I talked to my parents and they said he needs to go in and see a doctor because if it\u2019s strep it could spread to his heart or kidneys, so i told him we need to go to urgent care and get tested. his family is lower income so i offered to pay for all expenses his mom was against going to the doctor (i didn\u2019t know) she wanted him to just take Tylenol and rest, I pushed for the doctor and he left without telling his mom, he picked me up and we went to urgent care we checked in I talked to the nurse she said we needed parental consent before they did any test (I had called before hand and asked if a minor could come in for a testing and they said nothing about parental consent for anything) so Ashton called his mom and handed me the phone since he can\u2019t speak so I asked his mom if she could give consent for the strep test she hung up on me as soon as I asked, so we called his dad next no answer. The nurse told us we should go to the ER because they don\u2019t need parental consent and she was worried because of how swollen his throat is. we left and he took me home and then he went home. his mom told him that \u201cif you dont respect me then you can pack your shit and live with her\u201d her being me. I understand his mom being upset with him leaving and going to urgent care with me and then just getting a call asking for consent on a test but at the same time it\u2019s her son and she should put his health over everything and now i just feel like she hates me and i don\u2019t know what to do to make things better. My dad texted Ashton and told him we would take him to the ER right now and Ashton said no because he would get kicked out of the house if he went so we offered to take him tomorrow while his mom is at work and he told me he doesn\u2019t want to go behind her back which I understand but i\u2019m very worried for his health and i just want him to feel better i\u2019ve spent the last two nights with him taking care of him and I know how much pain he\u2019s in I just don\u2019t know what else to do or how else to respond to this situation.   UPDATE: (his mom not wanting him to go in is not for any religious reasons)  His mom said she would take him this weekend if he doesn\u2019t get better but i am worried that it will be too long and things could get seriously dangerous for him i can\u2019t even see the back of his throat when i check.

We've been here for over a year and we have never had any issues with the neighbors (A couple and 2 girls) living below us until recently. Back in November, a new couple and daughter moved in with the people down below us, but they aren't contractually living here. Couple A are basically subleasing, but they have 7 people and 3 dogs with them. The max capacity of the number of people in an apartment is 6 except for short gatherings. But ever since Couple B moved in here, it's been one problem after another. They keep slamming doors, kids AND adults are shouting, and husband of Couple B has been an inconsiderate prick parking his car in handicap and no parking spaces and revving his engine loudly at 4:30AM for the last few days. Back in December, I found out that husband in Couple B called the landlord to complain about our dog running around at 7:30 in the evening. So yesterday I called the police about his car not being registered here and being parked illegally so they came and wrote a parking ticket. But tonight they were banging on our floor/their ceiling and I tapped back with Shave-and-a-haircut to make sure it was ok. They tapped back so I assume nothing of it. We had been out all day, wife at work, dog getting fixed, me doing laundry at my sister's house. We just got a visit from the police claiming the people downstairs wanted to check on a domestic disturbance. My wife and I were sitting down and watching TV when they knocked. We were doing literally nothing and I'm wondering why they never come to me if there is a problem. I have never once made myself unapproachable to them. I've spoken to Couple A before and they seem genuinely nice. Ever since Couple B came in, issues keep coming up. I'm at my wit's end with these people and am wondering am I going about this the wrong way or do I need to make sure these guys genuinely get the picture that they are the ones that are not supposed to even be here? AITA?",

        "selftext": "So I was out at a bar the other night, and my friend and I met a group of people, and we all started playing cards together.  It was a really good time. I only drank one drink because I don't like being drunk on nights out.  Anyways torwards the end of the night, I saw this girl who I thought was super beautiful. I typically don't like imposing on other groups of people, however I indicated to her friend (we'll call her Beth) if I could get her attention. I said I thought she was beautiful and we just started a decent conversation (I'll call her Anna). I told Beth I liked a hair piece she had in and she said thanks. Anna & Beth started talking about some guy Beth was having troubles with and I apologised for eavesdropping but said screw him if he isn't going to treat you right.  I am a little traditional, and she was complaining that he lived five minutes away but didn't want to walk or drive the whole way to come to see her or meet her friends and she has to come to his.  Anyways before Beth left, she asked me for my instagram, and I politely declined saying I was interested in Anna.  Anna and I kept talking and I asked Anna if I could get her number and to take her on a date. Anyways I shot Anna a message, and she didn't reply for a few days. Then yesterday I received this text: Hey, my friend said you were chatting her up and when she turned you down you moved on to me. Kindly, It's better if you just focus on one girl you know for future endeavours I was taken aback so replied: Hey usually I wouldn't respond, but if this was your friend talking about guy troubles, she straight up lied.She asked for my instagram and I declined, because I was only interested in you.She should have read the room and understood that you had my undivided attention, and I was being polite to her because I felt bad that she was being disrespected by the guy she said she was seeing.I really liked your energy though, and you seemed genuine so l appreciate the message I also wished her well with something she told me she was doing.  I wish there was more to this, and I am a bit disappointed. On one side her friend lied about me, but on the other side it's her friend so I can't tell her not to believe her friend and it's improper for me to plead my case. I would usually never post this online, but I don't really care if anyone happens to see this, I'm just a naturally anxious person so felt a bit gutted but meh life moves on.  AITA in this situation, or is he friend totally wrong for this?",

        "selftext": "I\u2019m a 27F married to Matt a 27F and we have been married for 4 years now and started dating when we were 19 years old. We met freshman year of college and stayed together both through college and grad school supporting each other in our journey and we are very very happy together and very much in love and living in a beautiful home. My parents as a grad school gift to both my husband and I took us out to a very nice dinner and gave us a surprise gift for a weekend get away. They really went above and beyond and we are beyond appreciative. That being said my MIL (she is a single mom) just pointing that fact out to show there isn\u2019t a FIL in the picture so I don\u2019t get any comments such as, \u201cwhy are you blaming the MIL and not the FIL as well?\u201d My MIL gave just my husband a card with cash and nothing to me. And yes it was made very clear this gift was just for him alone and it wasn\u2019t an assumed card for the couple if that makes sense. According to my husband the verbiage surrounding the card and cash was, \u201cI\u2019m so proud of you son for graduating I know how hard you worked towards your goal of graduating.\u201d I\u2019m very hurt I wasn\u2019t included in the card. It\u2019s not about me getting cash it\u2019s the fact this wasn\u2019t addressed to both of us as husband and wife when we are MARRIED and we literally both just graduated. To me it should automatically be second nature when the person your child has been with since your child was a teenager and who is his wife and DIL and they both achieved this milestone at the same time to include their name together on the card and just address it to the two of them as a married couple. It\u2019s not even like he graduated and got a solo gift from his mother and then I graduated a few months later and she overlooked me. We could at least chalk it up to well she may have forgotten but no in this case we graduated at the same time and so this feels more purposeful like only her son\u2019s hard work matters and is being recognized and not her. At the very least if she wanted to give her son a separate card I dunno I couldn\u2019t get a small bouquet of flowers, a $20 gift card to a local coffee shop, a card with a handwritten note. Something? My parents treated us both equally and like a married unit when we graduated and my MIL was very much aware of that fact.  My question is AITA for stepping back from our relationship and being a little more cold to her now because I\u2019m seeing I\u2019m clearly not as important to her as I thought? I could be the AH for freezing her out without knowing what she did to bother me.",

        "selftext": "I (23afab) went to my mom's (40f) job last week to pick up some paperwork. While I was there my mom told me that my hair was a mess. I have locs and haven't had the time for a retwist so I just told her I'm gonna twist it this week. She then says that I'm only wearing half a shirt. I was wearing a crop top and thought she was making a joke so I laughed it off and left to go finish running errands. Today I called and asked her if I could come in to get some bloodwork done (she is a nurse and I need a TB test for a job application). She told me I could as long as I didn't look a mess like last time. I was confused and asked what was wrong with my outfit to which she replied that it wasn't appropriate for her work. She said that my clothes were inappropriate, my hair was a mess, and it made me look dirty. I acknowledged that my hair wasn't done and then asked what was wrong with my outfit: a crop top and cargo pants. She told me that the look didn't reflect on her as my parent. I told her that I had dressed with her in mind: I wore a bra, no crazy makeup, and even wore the shoes she got me because I know she hates my favorite pair; but it still wasn't good enough for her. She holds me to too high of a standard that I don't ever expect to meet and I'm tired. She responded by saying that she holds all of her children to high standards because that's her job as a parent.  This is when I kinda lost it. My mom had me at 17 and I have never lived with her. I was raised by my great grandparents and although we have a rocky relationship, they have more claim as a parent than she does. I told her that she doesn't have the right to parent me and that anything I do reflect more on my great grandparents than her. This isn't the first time we've had an argument similar to this but for some reason I'm more angry than usual. To say that I look dirty and that it reflects poorly on her as a parent is absolutely wild to me especially given our relationship. ",

        "selftext": "I've been a long-time lurker and this is my first post, none of my other friends understand my situation (they got assigned single rooms) so I'm hoping to get a nuanced answer from Reddit. So I (19) share a room with Sara (19) in our college dorm. By sharing a room, I mean we live in a 12ft x 18ft room with two beds on either side. it's a co-ed floor, tho the rooms itself are single gender and there are separate washrooms/showers for men and women. We're allowed to have guests stay over, up to 3 nights a month so as long our roommate is ok with it.  Once a week for the past couple months my roommate's bf has been driving over to hang out with her once a week. This is fine, i didn't mind at first because they would go on cute dates outside but now it's getting super uncomfortable for me. So now that it's cold outside they're just in the room watching movies and hanging out all day. This means I have to either sit there awkwardly (which is unpleasant and awkward for the both of us) or I have to leave and find somewhere to go. Sara's never kicked me out but I can tell she would prefer if I left and it's uncomfortable for me to stay anyways.  Last Friday, I decided to talk to her and asked her what she and her boyfriend were doing the next morning and she said they were going to watch a movie and stay in. At this I asked her if she could go somewhere else with him. She seemed really confused and I explained to her that I felt kind of awkward being a third wheel and like i was intruding on them (they're super PDA as well). Sara got really mad and said that her half of the dorm was hers and she could do as she liked with it. I didnt know what more to say so I ended the convo. Her boyfriend came over yesterday and I think she told him I didn't like him there because he looked really awkward and I just ended up leaving. i also heard Sara on the phone to him in the hallway and she was joking about how I was probably in love with him and/or jealous of her. Now I feel kinda shitty and I'm regretting saying anything. What is dorm etiquette? Am I missing something?",

Last week she had a panic attack about a bruised knee which was pretty much the only thing she talked about that day (over text). I said some nice things and wished her to feel better several times until I got overwhelmed by her anxiety. I told her that it was unbearable and that I hoped she understands if I take a step back and retain my own space in situations like this. She hasn't talked to me since. I understand that her knee hurts but I'm neither a therapist nor a doctor. AITA? Edit: To be clear, she wasn\u2019t bombing me with texts all day. It was more like, after I responded with nice words and recovery wishes and started talking about something else, she would always revert the topic back to her broken knee. She was also aware about herself being anxious, but still, after several rounds of this I got drained. This is not the first time this happened. ",

They have 2 cats that the only thing they do for them is feed them. They both constantly order stuff from Amazon and just throw the boxes into the dining room. I'm talking massive pile the size of a large suv. They occasionally clean, vacuum, dishes, etc. Things that I consider to be at a minimum weekly. The house wreaks of cat piss and mold.  I had a career that left me a bit physically broken. I can still manage day to day stuff but being in a car more than 2 hours really begins to aggravate old injuries. They know this and still want me to go up there to do something like take the trash out and all the other chores.  Here's where I am really having difficulty. My younger brother did live with them and somewhat help with these tasks. I say somewhat because he was an alcoholic and I say was because he died because of it. He was completely dependent on my parents to take him and pay for his alcohol. I didn't know how bad it truly was until he ended up in the hospital and the doctors said he would only have days to live. It ended up only being 1 day and I got there about an hour after he died. I know addiction is a hell of thing to deal with and also know that he ultimately made the choice to drink the way he did. I cannot seem to get the feeling that my parents are at least partly to blame for his death.  Every time I leave that house I feel completely emotionally drained. My wife thinks I should not go up there. I know she is trying to look out for me. ",

        "selftext": "Hello! Longtime lurker, first time poster here. I (25F) went to a friend\u2019s wedding a few months ago. The friends are Matt (25M), and Susan (25F). We\u2019re all part of a much larger friend group that gets along pretty great. To preface, I have actually never attended a wedding before in my life, and I don\u2019t tend to dress up or put on makeup. Nothing against it, it\u2019s just expensive and time consuming and I work 16-hour days in a uniform. I was really excited when I got the invite, saved up, and went to a shop I know carries my size (I\u2019m fairly tall). The clerk was amazing and so helpful. He chose a selection of dresses that would be wedding appropriate that weren\u2019t close to what the bridal party would be wearing and we had a lot of fun trying things on and he hyping me up. One of the options I just fell in love with. It was a beautiful dark green silk \u201cbias-cut\u201d dress (think Kiera Knightley in Atonement, without the sash and less of a flowing skirt). We matched it with heels and I\u2019d never felt prettier. The dress was on sale too, so that was a plus! Wedding day comes and it\u2019s lovely. I\u2019m so happy for my friends. Susan ignores me, which is weird, but she\u2019s busy preparing and then the wedding is in full swing and the reception is busy so I don\u2019t think much of it. Everything goes off without a hitch and they drive off to their honeymoon. I suppose it\u2019s relevant, but I received several compliments on my outfit during the event. I didn\u2019t think it caused a scene, and it wasn\u2019t anything particularly effusive or over the top. I was doing the same to others so I didn\u2019t think it stood out.Everything concludes, we all have a nice time. No one says anything until tonight. We all got together for a \u201cWelcome Back!\u201d dinner for Matt and Susan. During the dinner Susan kept making snipes at me about what I wore, just incredibly passive aggressive. It was very clear she thought I overdressed. I didn\u2019t say anything at the time because I felt terrible. None of my friends corrected or stopped her either. But looking back on it I feel\u2026 wronged? She didn\u2019t give me the benefit of the doubt and I don\u2019t feel like my dress was over-the-top. I do think I likely look very different from how I normally dress and present myself, so that might be part of it?  I\u2019m trying not to go over the word limit but am very open to questions and elaborations if needed.  So Reddit, AITA?  TLDR: wore a nice dress to a wedding, the bride is angry ever since. AITA?  Alright, my update was way too long and I honestly don\u2019t know if I can shorten it and it still give all the details - so I\u2019m going to be posting it on my own profile. ",

        "selftext": "Hi. 18M. So, my family is tense right now. My younger half sister (13F) has gotten to the age where she is being quite rebellious. She\u2019s popular at school, and does well socially. The problem is, she\u2019s become an asshole at home. One this about me is that I have OCD and I\u2019m autistic. When it comes to food, I need everything to be clean and can be quite obsessive. I wash my hands frequently, and must ensure that cutlery and dishes are spotless before I use them. I make all my own meals because I don\u2019t like people touching my food. Okay- now onto the main bit. My sister has recently started doing incredibly disgusting things in the kitchen. Some examples:- Scooping out Nutella with her bare hands- Putting DIRTY cutlery BACK in the cutler drawer on the clean stuff- Putting used and dirty dishes on the clean stuff- Putting dirty cutlery in the clean dishwasher This hasn\u2019t happened once or twice. I\u2019d say this has happened over 20 times in the last six months and it\u2019s really upsetting me. I was always the black sheep of the family, and bullied quite a lot. If I bring up stuff like this I get called mean names. Today was a bit of a breaking point for me. I woke up, and went to empty the dishwasher. In the clean cutlery section, there was a dirty knife put on the clean ones. On top of that, there was a used cereal bowl put at the top, so all the excess milk spilt out on the clean ones. This really, upset me. I\u2019ve tried telling my mom to be stricter, and less relaxed about this stuff, but every time I do I get told I\u2019m being an asshole because my sister is \u2018still learning\u2019 or something like that, and that she \u2018has hormones\u2019 and that causes her to be more difficult.  I get it. I get that she\u2019s at an age where she\u2019s probably most rebellious and least thoughtful, but this stuff genuinely really upsets me. 2024 I experienced severe stomach problems due to stress, anxiety, and the fear of throwing up, and through therapy I\u2019m trying to do more behaviour experiments to help OCD- but stuff like this just validates my fears. I\u2019m trying so hard to move out. Am I being an asshole? Am I being to harsh? It feels like my sister is treated as the favourite. I have an older brother (25M) who moved out a few years ago, and me and him had a lot stricter rules. Imo the stuff she\u2019s doing is disgusting and unacceptable. I get she\u2019s only 13 but at that age I would have never even fathomed doing stuff like that- because it\u2019s not only gross but puts other people at risk. I feel really upset.  If this happened once or twice I\u2019d be more understanding, but this genuinely happens so frequently it\u2019s insane. Also, she\u2019s just as unthoughtful in other places- so many times I\u2019ve gone to take a shower to find it covered in hair product and hair. I\u2019m trying to be patient and understanding but I can\u2019t.",

        "selftext": "first some context... i stopped drinking back in 2023 and havent touched the stuff since. i wasn't an alcoholic or anything but rather id just react badly to any kind of alcohol.  a week ago me and my friends were making plans to do something together in the first time in a while for my birthday.  i was pretty excited and was looking forward to it especially since they said they wanted the party location to be a surprise.  when the day came and they picked me up from my place and we headed out. we had a blast for most of the day going shopping, to a restaurant, and even saw a movie together. after that point i was really tired but one of my friends suggested we go to a bar to keep the party going. i was ready to object because i dont like drinking but before i could the rest of my friends replied excitedly to the idea and i felt like id let them down if i said no so i also agreed.  one of my friends (who ill call kate) noticed i looked a bit unwell at the thought awhile we were on the way and she told me as soon as i wanted to go home that she would drive me since she had no plans to drink either. i appreciated that and started to feel a bit better. we got to the bar fairly quickly and immediately the other 3 friends i was with went straight to drinking. it was a saturday night so the bar started to get full after a little while and i was left alone with kate as the other 3 were mingling and dancing.   i was beginning to feel a bit overwhelmed with all the people since i was exhausted by this point and i think kate noticed that too and asked me if i was ready to head home. i tiredly nodded and got up to find the other 3 to let them know i was heading out, but couldnt find them. i sent one a text along the lines of today was amazing! thank you for the best birthday ever! i ended up getting too tired and was falling asleep at a bar table so kate is driving me home, she will be coming back though so she can still drive you three afterwards. have a great night! and shortly after we arrived at my home. i slept like a baby.  the next morning,  i wake up to messages from kate and the other 3. kate told me not to freak out, but that when she got back to the bar my other friends were furious that i had abandoned them after all they did for me that day. i actually felt terrible, but kate was telling me not to. i still apologized to the other 3 but only 2 of them has responded accepting the apology. the other one is still mad. she said  that, if i didnt want to go, that i didnt have to say yes in the first place, and i think i agree with that... ig the whole situation is causing some anxiety since i try really hard to avoid situations just like this. its sorta a nightmare and im at a loss if what i did was wrong or not. so... AITA?  Ps. kate told me to add this, but according to her they didnt ask where i was until after they gotten in the car with her to go home. ",

        "selftext": "I (21F) and my partner (22M) have been together for almost 5 years. We had mutual friends through school, so we\u2019ve basically grown up together. For extra context, I\u2019m autistic. I need structure and I like having things sorted way ahead of time. My partner is not, he just tends to \u2018go with the flow\u2019. Going on vacation together has always been a goal of ours. We were both absolutely certain we wanted to go on vacation in summer 2025. I brought up that we should get looking ASAP if we wanted a better variety of places to choose from within our budget. We both agree.  Throughout January, I\u2019m sending him links, sites, deals - all of which meets our \u2018list\u2019 of what we\u2019re looking for. He says yes to every one of them which I found odd. Surely you\u2019d have some preference, right? I assume he\u2019s eager to go and genuinely likes them all. Bare in mind we are both paying 50/50.  By the end of January, we still haven\u2019t booked because he keeps leaving things until last minute like telling his boss he\u2019ll need time off.I call him out on this as I\u2019m getting a little anxious, majority of the places we liked were now at capacity so those were off the table. I\u2019m worrying we won\u2019t find somewhere we both like if we don\u2019t get it booked soon and that he doesn\u2019t actually want to go anymore. He repeatedly assures me he wants to go and that he\u2019ll get it sorted with his boss, and he does - or so he says. Come February, we finally find our ideal place and book it, we\u2019re excited. A few days after, he says he\u2019s going to have to reschedule our vacation dates due to something at work.  This gets me angry. I told him beforehand that I cannot reschedule my time off work like he can, hence the \u2018nagging\u2019 him previously. I work for a big company, often short staffed and cannot take annual leave if someone else is off work at the same time, whereas he works in a quiet local bar in a small town mostly targeted at older people. After talking, he hadn\u2019t told his boss we\u2019d booked it, only that he was wanting to have time off around summertime and was looking into a vacation. He hadn\u2019t told or confirmed with his boss the dates we were looking at before we booked it, nor did he let him know as soon as we\u2019d booked it. He\u2019d left things until last minute again. To add, the rescheduling is because his boss is having a dispute with another business and it got moved. On occasions leading up to this, his boss has repeatedly said that it isn\u2019t important that my partner be the and is solely a preference because they are friends.  I told him I won\u2019t be going on vacation with him at all now because he refuses to prioritise things properly. If I can\u2019t trust him to complete simple tasks, then I can\u2019t trust him enough to fly to a different country with him, keeping in mind we have never travelled without our families before. I understand that he should be there for his boss, but he should\u2019ve confirmed these dates with him ASAP and take it seriously.AITA for being too extreme?",

Jake loves giving hugs and being otherwise very physically affectionate with all of his friends and I\u2019m not at all comfortable with physical contact due to personal reasons. We\u2019ve tried other solutions like using a hugging emoji instead because he feels like by not being outwardly affectionate he\u2019s not being himself at all. The hugging emoji started being worked into every text all the time and it began to make me increasingly uncomfortable and Jake unfortunately picked up on it. He got really upset with me and said that it\u2019s really unfair to him that I can\u2019t be more affectionate especially since I\u2019ve been really busy with work and other things lately as we haven\u2019t been able to hang out much. I honestly agree I feel like he\u2019s been trying to be someone he\u2019s not to make me comfortable but I don\u2019t know how to make myself more comfortable with either the emoji or physical contact. So would I be ta if I told him that I can\u2019t do either of those?

Sorry in advance if the format or phrasing is wonky, i'm on my phone, and English isn't my first language. For background info, I've been through 7 months of treatment for an autoimmune disorder, and because a handful of people (parents, siblings, a couple friends) wanted updates, i made a group chat where i could post whenever there was anything noteworthy to tell people, as it was easier and everyone could get the same info and answers, and i didnt have to stress about making sure everyone got the info. However, I have a third sibling (let's call her Jane), who I've never been close with. Our relationship has always been kinda bumpy due to mental health issues (she is autistic), and last we've chatted was in October last year. Prior to that, it'd been a year. She also has periods with very poor mental health, and can easily get a little overwhelmed or overstimulated. So when i made the group, if people dm'ed me asking for info, i'd throw them in there. I havent gotten a single message from her the entire time, and whenever the topic came up in conversation, she seemed indifferent at best, and honestly like she didnt really care. Yesterday, I was at the hospital and got the great news that we finally found a medication that worked (yay, no ileostomy for me for the foreseeable future!!), so I let people know in the chat, and then didnt think anything more of it. Until today, when Janette came by for a quick visit, and on her way out told me that Jane was upset I hadn't reached out to her and told the great news. When I told my mum why (I didnt want to burden Jane with the flip-flops of thinking the meds worked, then bad news, and honestly she didn't even bother reaching out to me in the first place, so why would i assume she wanted to be in there??), she doubled down and told me to just add her anyways. We ended on a slightly sour note, with me saying something to the effect of i didnt want to overwhelm her, and why would i add her, if she doesnt seem to be interested?, and my mum completely ignoring the isn't interested-part, but saying i'll tell her you didnt do it to protect her. Am I in the wrong for not notifying Jane? We barely speak at all, and I'm honestly a little confused why she wants that info, when she hasnt reached once this entire time. No phone-calls, no texts, not one message on social media. I haven't given her any info when trying out the other medications, so why would this be different??",

Now, I am used to that, it\u2019s been that way our entire relationship, when he is home he is great and slots in perfectly.  He occasionally goes abroad for work, a few weeks at a time which obviously adds more pressure on to me to cover everything and needing more help from grandparents when I have work or my business etc etc. He is going away again soon, but this time will have two trips in quick succession, meaning I\u2019ll be on my own for a total of 4-5 weeks, I am so done! I am tired, and I miss him. I need him here and I hate this job of his, I really wish he would just quit(sadly not an option.) Now, AITA for wanting an apology from him or at least some form of grovelling haha. I know it\u2019s not in his control but I still feel an apology for putting me through all of this would help.

        "selftext": "for years I (24F) lived in a house, that Shelly (F25) who was my friend from since elementary, got from her granddad.I moved in when I was 17 and because we were friends she let me live there for years paying cheap rent (utilities not included). She never thought to make me sign a lease.  the house isnt big but theres 2 bedrooms. a few months ago I was asked if I would be okay with a new roomate. it was getting cold out meaning gas bills would go up, so I thought it would be great to have help.   I never saw this roomate after he moved in. a month later when I started noticing things like dirty shoeprints, unclean toilet, and garbage being left around the house. I was frustrated because whenever I knocked on his door to hopefully talk suddenly his tv would turn up and id get no answer. I always only ever knocked once and never pestered. I told Shelly about this and asked if she could talk to him for me. she told me she would however things took a direction that I didn't expect.  fast forward to last month. it was a Saturday and I was going to sit down and have some drinks awhile watching tv to reward myself for a promotion I got. I stayed up late watching movies when I hear my roomate go past my door towards the front at almost 4am. I also only realized in that moment it was nearly 4am so I turned my tv off to go to bed not thinking much of it. thats when i got a knock on my door.  I said hello? and heard Shelly. she asked me how I was and I told her I was drunk and about to go to bed hinting I didnt really wanna talk. she then opened my door.  I was taken aback but too dazed to really process what just happened. she then tells me that she talked to him and that shes come to the decision that she wants to evict me. I was startled since I don't have anyone to fall back on and the housing market is evil. if i cant find a house ill be on the streets. I asked why shes doing this and she tells me that during her talk he told her I was creepy and stalkerish but she didnt go into detail about what that even meant. she told me to be out of the house by 30 days then left. I couldn't go back to bed after that. I was too busy trying to find a new place to live because I didnt want to spend energy fighting in court unless necessary. thankfully about 5 days before i was expected to be gone I found a new house to rent. but if i were to pay my last months of rent I wouldn't be able to afford the damage deposit which needed to be paid before i was allowed to move in. I decided that, because of how she evicted me for no reason and there was no lease that I wasn't going to pay.  Its been only a week and shes gone out of her way to leave at least 3 hand written letters at my new place still damanding rent. when I talked to a few different friends about this ive gotten different responses. because of these mixed messages and some guilt im feeling for someone I knew since we were kids, im writing this post now.

She has stated this throughout the years.

Amongst our friends, Elle is the only unmarried one. She's made it clear that she's unhappy with being single, sincerely hopes to get into a serious relationship, and get married sooner rather than later. I can understand her frustrations, especially since she's the only single friend, wants kids someday, and so on.    About a month ago, Elle told me that she intends to be more proactive with dating this year and asked if I had anyone to introduce her to. Unfortunately, I don't, but another friend mentioned knowing a great guy (who I happen to have met before) who's single, and looking for something serious.  Elle was introduced (via text) to the guy, and they soon started talking on the phone. Elle says he has a lot of good attributes (e.g. very educated, high salary) but she finds him completely unattractive because they're the same height (he's 5'7 and she's 5'7) and because of his darker skin tone. I tried to convince her that his height and looks shouldn't take precedence over his personality, but this soon led to a major revelation on her dating standards that left me completely dumbfounded.   Elle told me that she's only interested in men who, in her words, is an 8 or better (looks-wise),  taller than her when she's wearing heels, of a certain complexion, ideally no beard, has advanced degrees, making over $100k/year, doesn't have kids, and is currently attending church every week or every other week.  But the big kicker that got me was that she insists that she's unwilling to date a man (like...go out on dates) who won't commit to waiting until marriage for sex. Yes, she's religious but she's not a virign and has had sex in all past relationships.    According to Elle, this is a conversation that should be had before even the first date, and if the guy isn't firmly agreeing, it's a no-go. When I challenged her thoughts and logic on this, she got increasingly upset.   I told her that I think she's asking for a very tall order, making dating harder than it should be. I'm not saying she should compromise on her religious values, but I am trying to tell her that she should be more open-minded about her criteria because she's looking for a one in a million guy, while also prematurely shutting down and shutting out some potentially great guys because of their income and/or height.    Elle is now furious at me and says I'm not being a supportive friend. She says that I don't understand her faith and am being something of a Debbie Downer. AITA?",

My husband had 2 months off and has been working full time since. He\u2019s off on Sundays and Mondays. I have never left my son except to go to a wedding in December but we were only away for 3 of his wake hours. My in laws watched over him and everything was fine.  I go back to work next week and my son will be attending day care. My husband is off this entire week and we\u2019ve just been taking a staycation. I told my husband though I want one day on my own to get more comfortable from being away from our baby and that I want him to have the day with the baby on his own. He has never been alone with him for more than an hour. He is a good father though and will help out when needed. But he has never been there for the full blown cries and fussiness while having to take care of the house.  A few days ago, we went to a friends house and our son was screaming bloody hell. Whenever I held him, he would calm down. Whenever my husband held him, he would just scream and cry even louder. So my husband just passed him along to me. I was getting frustrated cause I just wanted to relax with friends and he couldn\u2019t calm him down for a minute.  Today he tells me that his mom will be coming to help out. I asked him to tell her never mind cause he should be able to do it on his own. He called me ridiculous and it shouldn\u2019t matter but I think it really does. I can\u2019t be bothered at work unless absolutely necessary so I wanted t this to be our \u201ctrial\u201d. His mom will also be working on Mondays so it\u2019s not like she will be available to help out then. His mom is taking his side but of course she will cause our son is her only grandson.  So AITA for telling husband to figure it out and step up?  This is my first AITA post and I\u2019m frustrated just writing this so if you need more details to decide, just let me know and I\u2019ll respond.  ETA- I had a c section and I exclusively breastfed so I physically could not leave the baby in the first 2 months. My lactation consultant told me not to pump until after 2 months as I needed to establish my milk supply. He took care of my while I took care of baby. He doesn\u2019t do NOTHING. When I started pumping, husband was already at work. Husband does do feedings now.  ETA2 - this isn\u2019t a punch towards his mother. I adore her. It\u2019s really about him being independent with the baby. She helps us and I always appreciate it. Idk why yall think I\u2019m spiteful.  ETA3 - When my husband is home, I do separate myself from them by going to a different room. But he does often come to the room for help. I\u2019m not just dropping him off. ",

        "selftext": "Backstory: My older sister has been single for over a decade and the past few years has been basically in love with her mutual friend for several years, but he's been engaged to another woman for the past 2 years. Over the holidays he emotionally cheated on his fianc\u00e9e (did sexual stuff online with a stranger) and she understandably broke up with her and ended their engagement over this past New Year's. After the breakup, my sister met up with him as a friend to hear about the breakup and hang out, but I guess once they did that, he suddenly started to develop feelings for my sister and now they're basically dating but not officially yet.  She told me that he struggles with his mental health and he's seeing a therapist and on medication now, and she told me that he SAID he wanted to take 3-4 months off dating but now over only a few hangouts, him and my sister are basically together now which I feel like is SO fast and this man really moved quickly. I want to be happy for my sister because she is finally with the guy she likes a lot, but it feels icky how fast this all happened, especially because he was the cheater in the last relationship.. My cousin is getting married March 15 and now she wants to bring this new guy to the wedding. \ud83d\ude43 The wedding is here in FL where I live and my sister lives in Virginia, and usually when she visits I let her stay in the guest room and in my condo with my husband and I. But now that she is insisting on bringing him to the wedding, regardless of whether my cousin can accommodate him or not at the actual wedding, he is still coming with her to visit my whole family for the first time. I feel like all of this is happening way too fast, maybe it's just me because I have a hard time with change, but am I an asshole if I don't feel comfortable letting her and her extremely new boyfriend stay at my place?

        "selftext": "Context: I'm 16M, currently living with my dad and step-mom + 2 older step siblings (Male and female). I do have a biological older sister who is currently living with my mom. My parents were divorced a long time ago when i was still pretty young (idk how old i was), i was living with my mom and sister for most of my younger days and would visit my dad's house during the weekend up until i was around 9 or 10 before i fully moved in with my dad and my new step-family after they asked me to. I used to be a naughty kid since I used to whine and act all bratty towards my step-siblings sometimes, so I'm not exactly close with them whatsoever even until now, but we're on okay terms even if we don't talk often. My step-mom doesn't exactly treat me in a 'bad way' but she does scold me sometimes, and she does speak things/complain out loud pretty blatantly about me sometimes that makes me feel upset. I try not to think about it much since I'm pretty sure this would be normal for some ppl, but I still can't get used to the fact she does this and i don't feel comfortable listening to it.My mom basically comes to visit me at school every week after school just to give me cash, sometimes she also gives me snacks, even asks about my well-being, including questions if I'm ever going to hang out, sleepover, or even move back with her to which i said no to. Usually whenever i come home, i tell my stepmom about my mom visiting (either that or my parents would ask), and i include how i declined most of my mom's invites (since I'm sure my dad nor my stepmom would yap on about it in a not so good way, so i just give them the only answer that'll satisfy them). Also, my parents don't like me bringing stuff my mom gave me back home, because apparently she laced them with weird stuff in it (that's what my step mom says). And i also don't have my mom's number (because my dad wouldn't let me), so we don't contact online. Until now my parents' relationship still isn't okay because of finance as far as i can tell As of recently, I've been beginning to think about whether i should actually move back with my mom. Sometimes i feel like i don't belong with this 'step-family', like I feel like a burden at home and i feel like everyone else would be better off without me, especially with the way my stepmom treats me (even if it isn't intentionally supposed to make me feel upset). But just to be clear, both my moms have done the bare minimum of what any mom does like cooking and cleaning.  I guess i want to move back with my mom mainly because i still see her as a more 'mother-like figure' since she's more physically affectionate, and also for financial reasons since I'm starting to doubt things are gonna get any better if i live any longer with my dad after we basically moved to a new but smaller house that practically belongs to my aunt and even sold his car. Which might be an A-hole move to do. So WIBTA if i moved back with my mom? ",

        "selftext": "My cousin S and I were incredibly close since childhood, despite our five-year age gap. We were confidants\u2014or so I thought. Last July, S started dating A, and their relationship accelerated rapidly. A, recovering from a difficult breakup, seemed like a breath of fresh air. They decided to marry just 4-5 months into their relationship. Her parents initially opposed the match. I supported S, believing A was a good person. I even argued with her parents, and my mother\u2014S's aunt\u2014also fought for her within the family. S had lived with us for over a year during her studies, during a time of significant financial hardship. My mother showed her extraordinary care, arguably more than she demonstrated towards her own children. After months of drama, her parents finally blessed the marriage. Then, S dramatically changed. She became self-absorbed, obsessing over her wedding while excluding everyone. It felt like she used our family to get what she wanted and then discarded us. During this period, two young family members passed away. In our culture, such losses typically mean avoiding celebrations for a year. S showed no emotional response and set her wedding date merely 8-9 months after their deaths\u2014an action many found extremely insensitive. Her behavior grew increasingly hurtful. She got engaged without inviting me or my mother, claiming it was a surprise\u2014despite numerous relatives and friends being present. She visited my city multiple times, deliberately avoiding including me. She scheduled her wedding the day before my brother's critical board exams, knowing he would need my study support. Her communication became manipulative. She'd send lengthy midnight messages portraying herself as struggling and lonely, repeatedly asking if I was upset. She changed her bachelorette venue last minute, ensuring I couldn't attend, and instead went out with friends. These actions made me feel she was more interested in maintaining a facade of closeness than genuinely being present in our relationship. Considering these circumstances, I've decided to skip her wedding. In Indian wedding culture, RSVP isn't standard, so I plan to make a last-minute excuse. Am I the asshole?",

This is my first ever post on here so sorry if the writing is a little iffy\u2026I (16 at the time, F) was invited to hang out with my friend (18 at the time, F) and her boyfriend (19, M). We went to the mall first and everything seemed to be fine. (We\u2019ll call my friend Sam and he bf Jack) Jack was a good guy, super friendly and funny. I thought he seemed really good for Sam. We ended up in Hot Topic, looking at all the random things we wanted but didn\u2019t need. Jack picked up a little among us blind bag and showed it to us asking if he should get one. I laughed and told him we should all get one as a \u201ctoken of our friendship\u201d I was mostly kidding because I hadn\u2019t known him very long but he bought three of them anyway. Once we were done at the mall, Jack suggested we all go get dinner since Sam was getting kind of moody. We went to a local mexican place (so so good) and we all just chatted while we ate. At this point I\u2019m having a pretty good time and definitely approve of the relationship (the whole reason I was there pretty much). Once we finish eating Jack and Sam drive me home. I open up my little blind bag and show them the among us guy I got. We all laughed at the funny little plastic toys and then I said my goodbyes and asked Sam to hang out again soon. She said yes and seemed totally fine at the time\u2026 That is until about a week later when I find out Sam has blocked me on almost everything without a word. I wasn\u2019t too put off at first as I know she\u2019s done this to many people in the past due to mental health problems so I never got in the way. I brushed it off for about a month until I was hanging out with a mutual friend, Taylor(17, F) and she told me everything. Apparently Sam thought I was being way too friendly with Jack and that I was going to try and take him from her (which would be illegal as I was 16 at the time and he was 19.) Sam decided she\u2019d rather break off an almost 5 year friendship than \u201crisk\u201d losing some guy she met on Tinder a few months back.  For context: This story is from a few years back but I wasn\u2019t on Reddit then and it still doesn\u2019t sit right with me.  So, am I the asshole? (Feel free to ask any questions! I might have left out some details on accident \ud83d\ude05)",

I also removed her on all socials. Her boyfriend and mine are obviously aware of this, and my boyfriend is not her biggest fan as a result of this (and his best friend is aware of how we both feel about her as they spoke after).  Now were planning the party and lots of our friends have significant others who are invited to the party. We didn't specify on the invite whether plus ones are allowed, we just used an app to manually invite everyone (including s/os who's numbers we had) and then those who are bringing someone we dont know just add their own plus one. I'm not sure if we need to pre-emptively clarify to him that she's not invited? WWBTAs if we don't send her an invite? We obv have her number so when we send out the app invites, he will get one and she wont and they will be able to see that other s/os got one (the app shows  a list of invitees and their RSVP status to everyone).  (i would personally expect them to not invite me and I wouldn't go even if i was), I'm also concerned that if we invite her to be polite she'll think everything is cool (it is not) and I also don't want to set the precedent of her expecting an invite to other special events like birthday or weddings etc?

        "selftext": "This backstory is important for it to make sense later - My dad already died 11 years ago and he was adopted when he was a baby, someone left him on his adoptive parent's door. His parents named him and used their surname for my dad. In my country, it is illegal to add your surname to the adopted kid. But it was back in 50s, nobody cares that much.  My dad is the only adopted kid and the eldest of 5. Although he was adopted, he really loved the family and worked really hard to support them. He also had to leave his dreams behind just to support his small siblings. The siblings knew how hard my dad worked his ass off.  Grandparent already died as well 20+ years ago and left some inheritance. My dad was part of the inheritance due to having the same surname. My dad was promised by their siblings that he would get his portions. The inheritance took years to process due to missing documents etc.  All was good, untillll, my dad died. His siblings decided to remove his name from the inheritance saying he was adopted and not qualified to get the portions. His siblings kept pestering us to tell the lawyers the truth and back out from the inheritance. To be honest, we didn't care about the inheritance, but the way they treat us after my dad died, it hurts us. We felt being betrayed and who knew, just because of inheritance, they throw us like some trash. If my dad was here, surely he would be depressed seeing how his siblings treated us. He really loved them.  And since that moment, I vowed myself and let my family know that I will not join any family events and do not want to see them anymore. My siblings agreed, and my mom too agreed, but since she is the oldest sister-in law, she had to join the family events just to respect my dad. My mom told me that if my dad was here, he would want his family to be here to celebrate my wedding, and out of respect to my beloved dad, I should invite them. But I stand firm on my decision, they didn't respect my dad after he died, so why should I? I know, not inviting them will get them on nerves and will keep pestering my mom if I didn't invite them. And people will talk and it will look bad on my mom and my late dad. I really don't want my parent to get the bad reputation just because of I hate them. Buuutttt, I really don't want to invite them, I know I will have bad mood through out the wedding if I see their faces. And no, I am not close with the cousins. So I really don't mind. WIBTA?  ",

        "selftext": "Okay sooo first of all here's some necessary info about this. I'm 15f, freshman in a boarding high school. I share a dorm with two roommates, one which I'm gonna call M and the other one S. We're all the same year. I have ARFID and am anemic, which causes me to be often low on energy.  Sooo like the title says, I'm not going to eat with her. M is always begging me to go and eat (or just wait) there for like 15 minutes. We have three meals every day, breakfast before our school (which starts at 7:30 most of the time), lunch which is like riiight after school, and the dinner which is at 18:00. Usually, S goes with her, but she also has other friends so she often ends up not going with M. I do sometimes go with her, but it's just awkward because I can't really eat most of the things there because of my eating disorder, so I just take the tiny yoghurt and wait there while she or they're eating.  Most of the time when M asks me to go with her, I say no. I just don't have the energy to get ready and go be around people for 20 minutes while she's eating. She keeps asking maany many times,  and my answer is pretty much always no, since I buy myself stuff I like at the store and am not hungry. M, on the other hand, doesn't have as much money so she needs to eat at the caffeteria. Whenever i tell her to just eat without me, she says how she's embarrassed to go there alone. After begging me for a bit, she finally gives up and stops asking, but doesn't end up going to eat at all.  But I'm starting to feel a bit, I don't know.... Bad? Like, she's not eating because of ME basically. I don't know what to do\ud83e\udd79 ",

Fast forward to 2024 in July I had my second child, from then I felt like things were getting a bit weird like the vibe but I had terrible postpartum with my second and was dealing with a lot (still am) so I thought it was just me. We played online games together a lot and she got me into a co-op game we could play with teams and such working around our time differences was hard but we figured it out, I had found out on of my friends from my town also played so I would load up a round or two with them, I had mentioned to my long distance friend about her before and she seemed to have no problem with the idea playing as a team. There was this one day though where I messaged both of them if they wanted to run a game, I got an answer from my in town friend and they were down, waited for a bit to see if my long distance friend would answer and there was no response so I loaded up anyway. 2 hours later I get a reply on SC in the middle of my match, I did open it with the intention to reply after I died but I forgot, I did message her about something random that same night but no response so I went to bed. The next morning I get a text about how I ignored her and that\u2019s why she didn\u2019t answer me back that night, I apologize and said I totally didn\u2019t mean to forget to message her back but she didn\u2019t see it as I forgot but that I purposely ignored her. I tried to explain that\u2019s not what had happened but she felt I was being defensive when she was trying to express her feelings and if I didn\u2019t mean to do it why did I do it anyway. To me she was stuck on this feeling of being ignored and didn\u2019t want to hear anything else so I stopped answering, a couple days passed and she texted me about how I have made her feel ignored and unappreciated, that nothing she said mattered and I was acting differently. Again I had a baby in July of 2024 so I wasn\u2019t gonna pay any attention to that cause I had 2 kids now and not just one so my priority had changed and I wasn\u2019t gonna apologize for that (my kids will always come first). I still don\u2019t think I did anything wrong but she\u2019s definitely trying to make it seem like I did. So AITA",

So me and Bianca had been friends for almost 2 years and were so close, we would do everything together and I had been around for any guy she showed interest in but when she got with Ean I noticed Bianca didn\u2019t hang around me as much. I didn\u2019t mind since I know couples always have that phase of being obsessed with eachother so I brushed it off. Eventually we became a small group of us three and would hangout together, it was fine for a while and I even had eans number incase we needed to be in contact (for birthday planning, valentines gifts for bianca etc etc) we had barely texted maybe once or twice but always about Bianca. One day I was out at target and I was down the street from Bianca\u2019s house so I had planned on getting her a gift and bringing it to her but she wouldn\u2019t answer my calls so I texted ean to ask if she was home or with him and he just told me she was home but probably with family and wouldn\u2019t answer which was fine. I then asked him if he could text her mom for me as me and her mom don\u2019t have a great relationship and he asked why, now here is where the problem comes in. I didn\u2019t think anything of the story so I told him that her mom didn\u2019t like me because me and Bianca had been hanging out at her house on time and her parents overheard us watching Instagram stories and our schools fight page but I didn\u2019t know my headphones were still Bluetooth connected and they heard everything. Now after I told him that story I went on with shopping until about 10 minutes later a for a message from Bianca calling me a backstabbing b*tch and that I told Ean that she was talking to other guys. I was incredibly confused as I had not done that whatsoever so I texted her asking what the hell are you talking about? Now she stopped answering after that text and did not want to hear me out so I turned my phone off and went home sobbing to my mom as I don\u2019t like fighting with my friends. Eventually a few hours later Bianca texted me saying Ean had lied to her and threw me under the bus because he was suspicious of her and thought she was cheating on him and only said I told him she talks to other guys to see if she would confess. She apologized and said she shouldn\u2019t have fought with me but when I told her that he is insane and manipulated her and my story she said I was being unfair and dramatic and she wants to stay with him and make it work but still be friends with me. I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m being unreasonable and they should break up. Am I the asshole for saying that? ",

        "selftext": "Few days ago my boyfriend (33) asked me (24) what I\u2019d like for valentines. I showed him a picture of a wig I really wanted and I\u2019ve bookmarked for ages. He clearly didn\u2019t like it because it was long and flowy and went on a rant about his preferred choice of wig. At the end, we concluded on getting a wig we\u2019d both like.  However, I was visibly upset because I felt we always have to put his preference first even when it\u2019s about a gift for me. I wasn't even upset about not getting my wig of choice, I was upset because I tend to put his feelings ahead of mine and the one time I really wanted something, I still had to compromise.  If it were based on other reasons like budget, I wouldn't even mind forgoing it completely.  It just really sucked because I put a lot of thought into what I\u2019d get him solely based on what he likes.  He got upset that I was upset and now it\u2019s quite clear I wouldn\u2019t even be getting a wig at all.  He said some hurtful stuff and is making me out to be a bad person for being upset. I feel so heartbroken,I've cried so much my eyes are puffy.  Despite all of these and my numerous explanations, he's convinced I'm upset of a silly wig. AITA in this situation ?",

To put it in perspective, she just got a cold and she gets sick quite often. I also get sick often but not as much. She's an athlete and very into running and fitness, and I, however don't like it as much and i just do a bit of gym for fitness. So when she was complaining about being sick, I was empathizing with her and mentioned weak bodies unite as we both get sick. She, however, replied with ew i wouldn't want to be united with you. That kind of hurt me. I felt as if I was being looked down upon and since I know a few people already look down on me, it hurt a lot considering it was my best friend, my gf. So the day after, which is today, I mentioned this topic to her, and I said I felt hurt. She then said she only said it jokingly, to which i replied she's said jokes like these quite a few times. She then said they're jokes only, and that I should know better than that, that she wouldn't mean it to me ever and then walked off(she was already feeling kind of sick at that moment). So what exactly is happening here?",

        "selftext": "I, 16 NB recently went on a trip overseas for a holocaust tour. On this trip, me and a friend, lets call Keith, (17 NB) used mobility aids due to chronic illness. Keith used forearm crutches while I used a cane. Due to our conditions, we walked towards the back of our group. Neither of us had issues with this fact, however the teachers on this trip did. The second day of this trip, two teachers asked us to move to the front. The theory was that us walking in front would set the pace for the group. However, it instead made group members annoyed with us and did nothing. Multiple group members glared, muttering about it being unfair and it ended with everyone walking around us. The teachers started this by calling out, Hey slowpokes. After we shared our disdain for that they proceeded to call us, The ones with the third legs They also called us, Pace makers and Pace Setters Each time the group would move again, attention was brought to us as we were forced to the front. We tried to explain that this was not working out and was only causing more problems. Not only was the group annoyed with us, but we felt the need to walk faster, actively harming ourselves. The teachers refused to listen. Keith finally snapped at the teachers.They tried to force us to the front once more and we refused, saying it wasnt working. They stated that they didn't care if we didn't want the attention on us and to just move to the front. Keith snapped, yelling that it was not doing shit and they had no say over this matter. We were immediatley pulled aside. The teacher lectured us saying that we would not talk like that here but also that we are disabled and have to prove ourselves to the others and make them understand, ending with we are all on the same side. We both put our mobility aids away, but still ended up towards the back.Edit for clarity: We both have Eds and Pots which is why we use mobility aids. While we don't 'need' them to go places, without them we are both in immense pain and risk fainting. So we are able to walk short distances without mobility aids.",

        "selftext": "AITA: Basically, my best friend got a perfume for Christmas and I happened to mention to my boyfriend how I really liked it, but didn\u2019t need anymore perfume because I just restocked on my old scent for the new year and on top of that my mom got me my old, old scent for Christmas. I was genuinely interested in a new one because can\u2019t stand my old old one because the smell brings me back to memories of an incredibly hard time in my life, and I associate my old one with a past relationship. But I had restocked recently and been gifted so I was dead set on not buying anyone for years tbh.But flash forward and for our 6 month anniversary my boyfriend got me the same perfume as my best-friend. Which i thought was incredibly sweet because he didn\u2019t have to do something so big for a 6 month anniversary but he wanted to, and because he remembered that one time i mentioned how much I liked it. It really was the cherry on top of an amazing weekend and I was really excited about it and our relationship in general.Until, my best friend found out and is actually quite upset. She says she \u2018doesn\u2019t even want hers anymore\u2019 and said I should\u2019ve returned it (my boyfriend opened it for me to it\u2019s not returnable). I completely understand wanting a \u2018signature sent\u2019 (a phenomenon i think like most, my boyf has no clue exists) and would\u2019ve never have gone out of my way to buy it. However, I was gifted it, and it was a really sweet meaningful gift to me. I feel like it\u2019s kind of fucked up to insist I return the gift, not to mention I was having a very hard night (computer broke and missed a v important academic deadline) when the topic arose. I feel like it\u2019s a little understandable to a bit upset, but not to demand I return it and then go silent and passive aggressive, when i\u2019m already having a hard time. I feel like it kinda lends itself to a broader theme lately of her treating me unkind. Am I crazy for feeling that way? Am I the Asshole?",

        "selftext": "So let me start off with I'm pretty bad at checking the details on my bank statements, but recently something wasn't right. So I went through every single one for the past year, and there were over 100 charges from PlayStation. I only had 4 purchases on my 2 PS accounts in a single year, so I panicked as someone had my cc info. In all, the total charges were around 1500. I contacted both of my siblings who's kids also have accounts and asked nicely if their kids may have purchased anything using my bank account before i make a dispute. Both said no, so I went ahead and called both PS and my bank. The bank was able to chargeback past few months and rest is under investigation. Well a few days later I get a frantic call from my teenage nephew who says his PS account was perma banned. I asked him if he was sure he didn't buy anything with a cc after I gave him a several hundred dollars PS giftcard for his birthday this summer to spend on stuff, he again denied. So I have his email logins and sure enough, it was purchases he made to his account. All the stuff he plays. Then he starts to say maybe he bought a few items here and there.  Now my sister is pissed at me. She says I must have added my cc info to buy him something at some point in time, and it was all my fault he was making purchases from my card. If it were her cc, she'd get an alert. Never that he may have taken my cc info, no. She doesn't want him to lose his account, and said she'll call PS to pay for it all. She said he always asks and she gets alerts and doesn't understand that I didn't, so I shouldn't blame him. I said well he knew he was spending someone else's money, so why is it my fault? And that he stopped asking her for permission to make purchases because no one stopped him. After that she said I was blaming her kid for everything. So AITA here? ##Edit:  Info:He is almost 15.I'm unsure of how he got my payment info. ##Update! After an intense argument, she was still denying he made the charges at all. I was finally able to show her each and every transaction (before I had only explained and she didn't believe me). After seeing the evidence, he finally fessed up. He claimed he thought it was HER card \ud83e\udd2a. She will be paying me for all the money he used on my account and will not be getting the PS5 back, until he works to pay it off. Even then she may not let him have it. He insists that he will be paying us both double for our troubles. But the real damage done here is the trust I have in both of them.",

However, two months into the wedding preparations, I found out that my best friend had been having physical and romantic relationships with my ex-boyfriend. (The man I was dating prior to my fiance). I had dated my ex-boyfriend for about 2 years and throughout those two years she had been cheating with him. Things got a bit heated between me and her after that, but we were able to cool it down after she apologized, things were still tense, but I decided I didn't want to loose my best friend over a guy. I was still recovering from the shock of finding out what she had been doing behind my back, so I decided to demote her from MOH (and replace her with my sister). My best friend was still going to attend as a guest. She was upset at this but accepted. I thought things were good, but, last week, I found out she was talking behind my back and saying unpleasant things (she was calling me ungrateful, a biatch, mean, bratty, and other immature names). I flipped out and uninvited her from the wedding immediately. The wedding was only three weeks away at the time I uninvited her, so she said I messed up all of her plans by doing so. I do feel bad that it was so abrupt, but I didn't feel comfortable seeing her on what is supposed to be my happiest day anymore.  The wedding is on a weekend and the venue is 2hrs away from her house, so she didn't have to take a vacation to attend or anything like that, but I know cutting her out so close to the date was not the nicest move.

        "selftext": "I (19F) draw. In 2023 I noticed I make more $ w/ furry art. Once I began learning to draw anthros, I made myself a fursona to help me practice. A year ago my lil bro (16M), who we'll call B wanted to make one too for funsies. I've posted lots of art of his sona on my Instagram since then w/o issue. On my art accounts I use a name that isn't mine irl. I do this for my/B's privacy. I've never mentioned B by name before. He's called brother & my followers are my own friends +strangers.He's told me he doesn't want his friends to see my furry art. He's embarrassed/ashamed of it. I'm comfortable with what I do tho & don't need validation from teens. B lives with my dad 3hrs away, none of our friends overlap, so my followers aren't a sign of mine/B's identity. Only way to find my account is to search for it directly or be following my main (which is private) & finding info about it there. B's friends can't see my account unless he shows them or they're already following it; which means they would know what I draw & are okay with furry art.Yesterday B's bestie saw a post on my art dump Snapchat story (which she joined of her own accord) about how I became a furry artist & today B's been ordering me to delete him from everything. He wants there to be no evidence of him on my Insta account in case his friend goes to snoop. He sent screenshots of posts he wanted edited, including one that wasn't even furry art; just an OC he'd made. I asked him why that one & he just insisted all evidence deleted. I argued that on all images of his sona he's not named (btw I have 3 bros so brother doesn't even directly implicate him). & that on most posts the descriptions just mention how he made critiques/suggestions on what to draw w/o any inclusion of the fact that the OCs are his.He said he told his bestie that he didn't know about the characters, so including him at all would get him in trouble. While arguing, I was still making the edits cause I do respect his privacy even if I think his reasoning is bs.I told him I deleted him but that next time he wants to order me around he has to pay me like everyone else; if he wants to make these demands & be the boss he has to hire me.He said wow, so now you don't even respect if people want to be anonymous for personal reasons?. That pissed me off. I told him that I do respect privacy & I have many people I mention using an alias for that very reason. What I don't appreciate is being ordered to go through a year's worth of posts & edit them because he's insecure & hateful. That up until now I had done all his art for free & I don't appreciate the bossy attitude & lack of respect for /me/. So again, if he wants that power, he can pay me for all future art just like everyone else.He thinks I'm being unreasonable/that I'm wrong for posting about him to begin with (tho he's never complained til now).Edit: I had his consent all long, he just freaked out & got demanding/rude today. tl;dr: bro bossed me around, I told him if he wants that privilege he needs to be a paying client.AITA?",

        "selftext": "So, I (20sF) work at a restaurant, and I recently found out that one of my coworkers, **\u201cLena\u201d** (also 20sF), has been talking behind my back for a while. Apparently, she\u2019s been making comments about me being lazy, slow, and not doing my job****\u2014even though our manager previously told me I was one of the **strongest** employees on the team before he started hearing complaints from my coworkers. The thing is, **none of these supposed issues were ever brought up to me directly**. I had no idea anyone even had a problem with me until I found out that Lena had **been the one stirring the pot and turning people against me.** Meanwhile, to my face, she\u2019s been nothing but friendly, which makes this all feel especially fake and petty. When I learned what she was saying, I debated how to handle it. I considered: 1. Ignoring it and pretending everything was fine.2. Pulling her aside for a direct conversation.3. Writing her a **short, professional note**, since she never gave me the courtesy of addressing issues directly with me. I decided that **option 3** might be the best way to handle it\u2014giving her a **calm but firm note** that says:  *\u201cI heard some things have been said about me, and I want to address it directly. If there was ever an issue with my work, I would have appreciated you coming to me first instead of spreading it around. Moving forward, you don\u2019t have to pretend to like me or make friendly small talk, so let\u2019s keep things strictly professional. Hopefully, this is the outcome you wanted.\u201d* I plan to fold the note neatly, seal it with tape, and **hand it to her without saying a word**\u2014then walk away for my break, leaving her to process it. I feel like this avoids unnecessary confrontation while still making it clear that I\u2019m setting a boundary. However, now I\u2019m wondering if this approach might be too passive-aggressive or dramatic. I don\u2019t want to **stoop to her level** or make things worse at work, but I also don\u2019t want to let her think I\u2019m just going to sit there and take it. I'm a very introverted person but I think a lot of ppl mistake that for passiveness and see me as an easy target, but who knows? So, **WIBTA if I give her this note instead of speaking to her directly?** **EDIT:** To clarify, I was never given any feedback or complaints about my work before this. If someone had a real issue with me, I would have **gladly fixed it**\u2014but they never gave me that chance. Instead, they just gossiped and tried to ruin my reputation.",

        "selftext": "I (25F) am child-free so maybe there is some aspect of parenthood that I\u2019m missing here. My friend Stacy (26F) had her first baby about 9 months ago,  Hailey. Stacy and I had some tension brewing in our friendship since she was pregnant. In the past, my time and energy had been very much available to Stacy. At times I felt that she took advantage of my empathy and willingness to bend over backwards for her. She lived about an hour away, and was always in some form of drama or crisis. I drove up to be with her nearly every single weekend, and the times when I told her I couldn\u2019t for one reason or another, she would beg and usually guilt me with things like \u201cI\u2019m in such a dark place, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll do if I\u2019m alone, I really need this\u201d. She also did a lot of passive aggressive shutting down from conversation when she didn\u2019t get what she wanted, leading me to always give in and put my own needs aside. This went on for years. I grew tired of this pattern and started therapy, where I learned to set healthy boundaries, speak up, and prioritize myself when it was important. These changes led me to cut the weekends I spent with her in half. I was in the process of buying a house, starting a new job and masters program, on top of family issues. I knew that she saw the change in our friendship and wasn\u2019t happy about it, but thought that with time she would understand and adjust. She never did, and insinuated that I changed because I didn\u2019t support her pregnancy or because my partner was manipulating me into not spending time with her. I explained to her many times that this wasn\u2019t the case and that I am doing all I can to be there for her.  Things came to a head when I had a health scare. I told her about it, and the next day she tried to call me. I was on the phone with someone else and couldn\u2019t answer, but texted her immediately after to let her know and make sure that everything was okay. She once again got upset because I didn\u2019t answer right away, and I had had it. On the very rare occasion that I ask for support from her she had to make it about herself. I didn\u2019t usually call her out but this time I did. I told her I didn\u2019t understand why she had an attitude, she said \u201cthanks for making me cry\u201d and then didn\u2019t respond to me for over a month. Then, when she finally did, she didn\u2019t ask about my health. She didn\u2019t apologize or even bother explaining. She instead accused me of using her daughter as a pawn by not acknowledging her. She said that Hailey didn\u2019t deserve absolutely no effort just because her and I were in a fight, and that it was so messed up that I would add Hailey into the equation. I\u2019m so confused. Hailey had nothing to do with the fight, and Stacy was the one who had ignored me for over a month. What was I supposed to do in this scenario? I can\u2019t text a 9 month old or just show up at their house. I\u2019m genuinely lost, can someone please explain this to me?

I especially appreciate the vulnerablility of those who shared their experiences from both sides of this situation. Stacy and I have been friends for a decade, and I have long speculated that Stacy\u2019s behavior stems from her past traumas and mental health. This is a huge reason I could never bring myself to abandon her or criticize the ways she copes with life, albeit unhealthy. Although I can empathize with her experience and care about her deeply, you all helped me see that with no end in sight, it\u2019s not a sustainable friendship for me to continue. I decidedly to be brutally honest with Stacy and of course, things ended in flames. I explained that her using Hailey to guilt trip me was manipulative and crossed the line, and that it is reflective of her behavior toward me throughout our friendship. I have done my best to be a good friend but find it impossible to meet the expectations she has for me that she doesn\u2019t even seem to apply to herself. I initially said I needed some distance from her, but her response was even worse than I imagined possible and the situation is now irredeemable. Some of my favorite lines were \u201cit is all about me and my family, get that through your f*cking head\u201d and \u201cif you don\u2019t want to be my doormat, don\u2019t let the door hit you on the way out.\u201d As well as letting me know what other people say about me behind my back and that I was meant to be Hailey\u2019s godmother but she couldn\u2019t bring herself to ask me because of what an absent friend I am. She has been blocked. I\u2019m devastated and relieved, and know I\u2019m not totally blameless for remaining silent and letting resentment build for so long. Thank you Reddit!",

        "selftext": "Context: I am about to be 30, only child with my mom and dad. But my mom\u2019s been invasive. I had journals I\u2019d draw or write down my feelings in when I was in my teens and she used to hate how I cleaned my room so she would kick me out to clean it for me and read/question them. I got rebellious and left at 18. They probably hated me for it for about 3 months and then 2 years later after living in my new state, convinced me to move back home with them. Mistake in my opinion. Fast forward. My bf and I met in my home state but he moved to go to his home state. He never got to meet my parents but also telling my parents about any partner I had was always like walking on eggshells. (My mom said my ex looked gay all bc he had long hair\u2026) and probably a little over 6 months into my lease almost being up with my coworker, me and him planned to live together and I wanted to go to his home state.I debated either telling my parents and be honest so it wasn\u2019t a repeat when I was 18 OR do what I did at 18. My dad bought a home in another state and was planning to retire in it, we argued bc they wanted me to stay so I could hold onto the house in my home state so my mom and dad could be at the new house and then come back in winter. I didn\u2019t wan to stay, so I told them not interested. Mom got upset, dad said \u201cwhelp\u201d and sold my childhood home. Forcing my mom to move with him. When I told them 6months into my plan, my mom was upset. Saying it\u2019s stupid, didn\u2019t make sense, soon my mom warned up to it. Dad\u2026 didn\u2019t.  When I left, I was so happy seeing my bf again after being long distance I forgot to text my dad the address of his apartment, prompting a text from my dad saying \u201cimmature, self centered and selfish.\u201dSince me leaving, my mom\u2019s been a mess. Resorted again to drinking. But she\u2019s a verbal drunk\u2026she called me over and over while I was working. When I texted her I was working and if things were ok, she went CRAZY. Saying I was a shitty daughter, didn\u2019t understand where she \u201cfucked up\u201d with me. Im a piece of shit, wish she never had me, called meloser, failure, saying she would block me, remove me from her life if I wanted nothing to do with her or my dad (which for months I texted and tried to call but the signal there isn\u2019t great bc the house is in the woods) and she just kept going. Blaming me for not taking my childhood home and said if she would have know I was going to be the way I was she would have aborted me. We argued until I said enough. That wasn\u2019t the first time she\u2019d tell me these things. She sobered down and the next day said \u201csorry\u201d but she feels the way she feels still with what she told me. I didn\u2019t answer. Few weeks later asked me for forgiveness. To which I said yes. She\u2019s my mom. Now she wants to talk. I text every now and then but when she asks about me I don\u2019t have much to say, all I do is work. Hang out. Eat out/cook with my bf and that\u2019s it. My dad doesn\u2019t talk to me.

Regrettably because I was mad about the whole situation I talked in an antagonistic tone which I feel only made things worse but I felt that I was fucked over for no good reason other than him avoiding paying me back and taking accountability.

        "selftext": "For reference, I am 5'4 (21f) and 200lbs. I used to be 220, but I am making improvements to my lifestyle and working on my health so I have lost some weight (and plan to loose more since I am still technically obese.) I was talking with my friends about various topics, as one does, and somehow the topic of body size came up. I opened up to my friends about how I was insecure about the size of my body, and that it made basic tasks like shopping for clothes and doing exercise more challenging, and I told them that I was trying to improve upon myself. However, my friends said that talking about my body size was making them uncomfortable and that we should move on to a different topic, and that it was inconsiderate to talk about private details during casual conversations. I thought that that claim was ridiculous because the size of my body is not exactly... a secret. Still, I stopped talking about it, but I don't thinking that me talking about my body was an inconsiderate thing to do because we were on that topic, and my friends (who are slimmer than me) had also complained about their bodies, so I thought we were bonding over sharing our struggles and insecurities. (As friends do). I know people have their boundaries, but was I really being inconsiderate by opening up about the struggles that I face in my body size?  Edit: Some people were wondering about the context. It was a get-together with me and 3 other friends at one of the friend's house. We have known each other for 4 years (we met in college) and I would say we are pretty close. My friends started the conversation about bodies and insecurities and were talking about how they felt insecure about things like hip dips, cellulite, etc. and how they felt like they couldn't always find clothes that fit them well, so I thought my input was appropriate at the time.",

        "selftext": "TW: Emotional and verbal abuse I adore my soon-to-be sister-in-law and have always had a good relationship with her. At one point, we were extremely close, talking almost daily. My fianc\u00e9 and his brother (her fianc\u00e9) come from a lot of family trauma, and while their relationship is complicated, the four of us have tried hard to maintain a positive dynamic despite personality differences. Over the past year, there was a huge family fall out, and a lot of family drama unfolded, and while my fianc\u00e9 and I tried to stay neutral and support everyone, it became difficult to stay close to them. We fundamentally disagreed with their approach to conflict, which often felt disrespectful, dishonest, and inconsiderate of others' feelings, including ours. They would repeatedly drag us into their drama, pressure us to choose sides, and put us in uncomfortable positions. While we describe them as good people who make bad decisions, it has been exhausting. Despite this, I pushed for us to stay on good terms because we\u2019re family and surprisingly, my individual relationship with my sister in law always remained positive for the most part. However, a few months ago, they started acting distant\u2014canceling plans, being short with us, and generally avoiding us. When I confronted my sister-in-law, she initially lied and said everything was fine (a pattern of theirs). Later, she admitted that her fianc\u00e9 (my fianc\u00e9's brother) has been verbally abusive, to the point where she\u2019s gone to her parents\u2019 house for extended amounts of time, started antidepressants, and is struggling with her mental health. This didn\u2019t shock us, as they argue constantly, even in front of us, but portray a perfect relationship online. I supported her, told her I\u2019m here for her as an individual, and even supported her to leave him if that\u2019s what she needed, while validating all of her feelings. We also spoke to my brother-in-law, who shared that she\u2019s toxic toward him too and has refused therapy because she insists she does no wrong. While his behavior is inexcusable, it\u2019s clear they are both deeply unhealthy for each other. Months have passed, and nothing has improved. They continue to fight, including at our home, where we\u2019ve had to intervene. It\u2019s draining, and while I feel sad for them, it\u2019s hard to stay close when we don\u2019t support their decision to get married. Still, we want to support them as individuals. Here\u2019s the dilemma: my sister-in-law asked me to be in her bridal party, and her MOH has planned an expensive bachelorette trip that will cost me around $3,000. I love her and want to support her, but the idea of celebrating a relationship I feel is so toxic is uncomfortable. On top of that, the cost would put me in a tough financial spot, especially since my fianc\u00e9 and I are planning and paying for our own wedding. My fianc\u00e9 thinks I should politely decline, but I worry about hurting her feelings, especially since we\u2019re the only ones who know what\u2019s really going on behind closed doors. What should I do?",

She refused to share details, insisting I believe her without question. Since Violett and I have been close friends for years, and I\u2019ve never known her to speak that way, I confronted her. She was shocked and had no idea what I was talking about, and I believe her. I also found it unfair of Margaret to claim Violett was saying things about me as well, but will not tell me that info either. If she is such a great friend wouldn\u2019t she want us to know what Violett has allegedly been spreading about everyone? Again- she hasn\u2019t even told me what was said about her or anyone in the friend group. She will not tell me any information.  Looking deeper, I realized Violett\u2019s vengeful ex\u2014who has lied about her before(even tried getting her fired from her job, but his claims have been proven false)\u2014is now trying to befriend some people in Violetts life. It seemed too coincidental that Margret suddenly heard something terrible about Violett but wouldn\u2019t reveal the source. I told Margret I couldn\u2019t fairly judge the situation without hearing both sides, but she got angry, refused to discuss it, and won\u2019t speak to Violett. She told me if we remain friends, I am no longer allowed to bring it up again.  Violett reached out to her saying she would like to have a convo and clear the air because her and Margaret had a very close friendship, but Margaret won\u2019t even respond to her texts. I don\u2019t think it is fair of her to not even give Violett a conversation because of the close bond they had prior to this occurrence. Margaret is not telling me to choose sides, or to not be friends with Violett, but I am also questioning Margaret\u2019s loyalty to me if whatever Violett is saying is so vile that she can\u2019t be in the same room with her and she is okay with me staying friends with that person.  Am I wrong for questioning these claims instead of blindly taking Margret\u2019s side? EDIT- Margaret is not sleeping with the ex I can 100% confirm she would not have any interest in him whatsoever but I will not get into that. ",

She would sleep on the floor or an air mattress at her moms house, which I thought was kind of sad.

The main ones that are important in this story are Tachycardia and chronic pain: I wear a hip brace and sometimes a knee brace for, but I'm trying to get a cane (the pain isn't only in those spots, it's basically all my joints and bones, but that's all my dad will let me get things for(will get into later)). I also have a lot of mental issues which are all diagnosed and I take medicine for. Alright, onto the main story. Due to my health issues, I've been trying to convince my dad to let me go to the doctors' to get checked out + I want to go so I can help prove to insurance that I need a cane (which multiple people in the health field have recommended), but my dad won't listen to me about that. He won't even let me get wrist braces. Because of the pain, I complain a lot about how my body hurts, and my dad tells me If you're so used to it, then it's not a big deal and stuff like that. We've gotten into arguments about this multiple times but I've mainly given up trying to convince him. But then came today; I had a really important meeting with a psychiatrist today which could effect the rest of my life. I had been stressing about it since last week since it's my second meeting with them. I was going to get picked up at around 1, but my dad texted me. He told me(summarized) Hey, I have to cancel the meeting until they have an opening because my heart is feeling really bad right now. Plus my head hurts badly and I might have to go the doctors' later.When he sent this, I became furious because he described his symptoms, it was the exact same things I've been dealing with since I was 11, and he's always tried downplaying it.Here's where I may be the A-hole. Instead of telling my dad Oh! I hope you feel better or something, I told him Have you taken an advil plus drank water? Or have you rested enough? Ir's probably just acid-reflux and then You should be fine after you take medicine and water. He told me that he still felt bad and that I should be more considerate.I feel bad because when he picked me up at the normal time to head home instead of early for the meeting, he sounded really in pain and tired: and I had been really rude over text. But at the same time, I feel pretty satisfied that he got mad at me for downplaying his symptoms and acting like it was an everyday thing to feel bad (which it is for me) the same way he did to me. I don't know, it's a weird situation. Any perspectives are welcome and I'm fine if I was in the wrong, I just can't tell right now.",

        "selftext": "So, am I the asshole for asking my sister when I'd be paid back? A few months ago, my mother asked me for a few hundred dollars to go on a trip, promising to give me back an extra $25 for every $100 I lent her. I gave her $400, so she was supposed to pay me back $500. Before she had the chance to repay me, my sister asked to borrow money. Since I was low on cash at the time, I told her she could ask our mother for some of the money she owed me. My sister ended up taking $100, but she never paid me back. Fast forward a few months, and she went to the casino and lost all her money. She called me, asking if I could lend her some. I didn\u2019t know at the time that she had blown it all gambling, but I was already annoyed because she hadn\u2019t repaid me from before. Still, since she has kids, I relented and offered her $100. Her immediate response was, *That's all?* I had already been left unpaid once, and I wasn\u2019t willing to give her more, so I confirmed that $100 was all I was offering. She took it and promised to pay me back on Monday. Three days later, on Monday, I asked her if she was going to pay me back. Instead of answering, she just said, *Why?* I asked again, and she repeated, *Why?* I reminded her that she had promised to pay me back Monday, but she flat-out denied ever saying that. Maybe I misheard her over the phone, but considering she had just bought three subs for $40, I pressed again, asking when she planned to repay me. At that point, she got angry, snapped, *I'm not dealing with this,* stormed out of the room, grabbed the money I had given her, and shoved it back into my hands.",

        "selftext": "I (26F) lost my mother to cancer when I was 8 and have always had an absent father. I only found out who he was when I was 13 and even then he did not want custody of me forcing me to stay in the foster system until I was 18. Over my whole life I have had about 5 conversations with him give or take- he is like a stranger to me. He appears once in a blue moon to ask for money or something along those lines. It doesn't really bother me anymore, I've just learnt to accept it now but i don't like talking about it so to avoid that conversation with people i usually just say both my parents are dead. This leads me to a year and a half ago when I had just started dating my boyfriend (25M) and like usual I had just told him my parents were dead but the other day my dad showed up at my door (I still don't know how he knows where I live) and asked for 100 dollars except my boyfriend was there and he obviously found out my dad was not dead. This lead to a long conversation with him that night where I explained the whole situation. He said this was a breach of trust between us since I lied about my dad and that he needed some space to rethink our relationship but he doesn't think he will leave me. I feel so shitty and that I should have told him earlier but I am going to be honest I just didn't think. So AITA? UPDATE: my boyfriend texted me 5 mins ago asking to talk so we are going to have a full in depth conversation tomorrow after work and I'll update again then :)   UPDATE 2 (last update): Before I get to the update I would like clear things up. 1. I have only given money to my dad once when I was still desperate for his love and acceptance but he did not get any money this time. 2. Despite his confusion my bf stepped in to defend me and get my dad to leave and it was only after my dad left he asked me about it Now onto the update. My boyfriend told me that all the sudden information along with the knowledge I hadn't told him the truth was very overwhelming and he just needed some space to not say the wrong thing. He also said that he got why I lied initially and he wasn't mad that I lied more hurt that I felt like I couldn't tell him about it. He also mentioned that he couldn't be there for me if he didn't know what was going on. The conversation ended in tears and it is the most vulnerable I have been in front of someone. He was very understanding and we have decided to draw a line in the sand and 'start again' if that makes sense. I have also looked into therapy for my childhood trauma and all in all I am using this as an opportunity to better myself and heal fully. Thank you for all your kind comments :)",

        "selftext": "Okay so we were having lunch and I mentioned how my mum (57) got sent a senior home panflete, the irony being she's not a senior. My friend who I will call M1 then asked her age and I told him, his reaction was to scoff and say 'wow she's old!' And bear in mind that I am NOT close enough with this person for him to be making jokes like that and personally I think it's blanatanly rude for someone's first reaction to you telling them your MUMS age to be and exclamation of how rude she is! So I was like 'okay...that was a bit rude' and then the rest of my friends proceeded to jump on how I'm saying that being old is a bad thing and how I'm saying again isn't beautiful, none of which I think, aging is a beautiful and lucky thing to be able to experience BUT to call a woman  'old'- yes she's past Middle Ag but I would not say she's old? Old is 65-70+ personally- espeiaclly when that woman is my mum,of course it's rude! In my head, if he were to meet my mum and say that too her face, he wouldn't, because it's rude! It was then bought up again that next day and I again insisted Thata it's rude and also that my mum is not old.  A couple of days later I found out that, after they all jumped down my throat aggressively telling me how I'm ageist and that I'm being rude not them, M1 (the one who started this all)had said to my friend F1 that he would stop jokingly make fun of F1 if she were to agree with him that my mum is old. This means that even though they KNOW it's annoying me they still had this little agreement together KNOWING it will wind me up, to then get annoyed telling me I'm starting a fight (I didn't raise my voice or get angry,just defended my mum). Is it just me or is it like they are winding me up on purpose and NOT in a friendly way? Please let me know if you also agree that this is rude!!",

        "selftext": "So a few weeks ago my family had a huge fight. Nothing physical but very verbal and rude. My Dad is trying to start a business I really didn't want to be apart of be abuse of past failed business ventures as well as in my opinion my Dad's poor work ethic as it concerns businesses he starts.  Start of issue: Anyway I went to see a client one day and I did my role like I was supposed to however there was one more thing that was supposed to be on the contract (it wasn't there) but needed to be noted. As well a piece involving a certain amount of money on the contract. That aspect is not my job. My father while not the best with work he knows how to take care of his clients aka making things easy for them. My brother on the other hand is very much, the client can fill that out. Well my father tried to speak with my brother and he was being very rude by just walking away. This is not new behavior he's been like this for years. Things escalated to the point of my father and brother yelling at each other, my mother starting to yell stop, and me coming out my room and yelling stop. In which my brother then tried to verbally attack me and I ended it with me calling him a b*tch.  This definitely wasn't my best moment and moments like this, and some in the past is why I didn't want to work with my family in the first place.  Anyway to my posed question... I apologized an in doing so I pointed out the differences in how my brother was raised versus me. My grandmother had a very big influence in my life. My Mom had cancer when I was 2 so my grandmother was there for a vast majority of my childhood to help out. As well as me being raised with different values than my brother. Either way now my mother and brother are upset with me because of what I stated which mind you has been said to me from my mother, it's been stated by my father, so this is not a family secret. I told him I'm going to just mind my business when they're arguing because the things they argue with him about inadvertently they raised him to have those values. I.e. a relationship with God but as a child pulling him from church on Sundays for games and birthday parties. Or how he speaks to my parents but his friends also spoke that way to their parents and they never redirected him to a different friend group. Certain things like that we were raised completely opposite.  Either way my brother isn't talking to me still and my Mom while she I'd talking to me I feel like it was very corny of my brother to share what I said to him with our parents. Anyway am I the A.H.? More detail, I'm (30F) and my brother is (24M). FYI I wanted to share images of the text messages but couldn't. Sorry guys.",

        "selftext": "So on the car ride from school I started talking about how I don't like band anymore (I've been through beginning band and football season of my first marching band year as trombone) because it's just not fun anymore and seems like a chore now. I was telling this to my stepmom (30 and used to be in band through senior year) and she started saying that I'm just wasting my dad's money and her time. She compared me to her two brothers who gave up in their high school years and how they're failures now, saying I'm going down the same path. Guilt tripping me. I started crying so her excuse was that she's never raised girls and how awful her life was when she was my age (I'm 14, 15 in two months). I told my real mom everything, since she's still very in my life (I'm just living with my stepmom and dad for the time being) and she told my dad everything, who thought it was unacceptable too. Even though, I still feel so bad because I suppose I am wasting time and money they put into just for one year.  I don't want things toeescalate and for my stepmom to think I hate her for telling my real mom everything. Am I the asshole wanting to quite band my first year?  Update:So, for people wondering, our school doesn't let you quit band mid year. You have to go through the whole year after starting. I live in a small town in the South. Everything was handled, but it's really bad being in a southern high school band. I'm not gonna be continuing, but I will keep playing with myself because I enjoy playing. Just not the band part. ",

This girl (we can call her Janice) has caused problems with me and my friends for the past four years. She has been constantly jealous of my best friend and has been attempting to take every opportunity she gets away from her. Before our show closed, I and my close friends went out to eat WITHOUT Janice. She saw this as a personal attack and told her mother, who then posted to Facebook saying, Seriously? You're overheard making plans, and then you lie about it to purposely exclude people? Nice... really nice. I and my friends were all extremely angry about this post and met up to talk about it. Janice found out and attempted to insert herself into the situation. We politely declined, explaining that we had our own plans and would spend time with her later. Her mother then added to her previous post, Some people just need to grow up. I and my friends were infuriated and have not responded yet. The majority of my friend group are adults, including Janice, and we are very disappointed in her reaction. I am done with Janice's immature behavior and her mother, who backs her up on every single situation that doesn't favor her. What do you think of Reddit? ",

        "selftext": "I (28M) am from the Philippines and have been in a bit of a financial bind recently, trying to manage our family\u2019s finances as best I can. My wife (28F) and I have two kids\u2014a 7-year-old son and a daughter who will be turning 1 soon. I\u2019m the only one working, and I earn about $850 a month. After paying bills and groceries, money is tight. In January, I received a total of $828. I paid $234 in bills in total and gave my wife $144 to budget for the first two weeks. The rest, I kept as savings for our daughter\u2019s birthday, with the plan to add more in the upcoming paychecks. Unfortunately, we didn\u2019t manage the $144 well, and by the next paycheck, we were down to $54 in savings. On January 10th, I noticed my wife only had $28 left, and by the 12th, she was down to just $5. When I asked how that happened, she got upset but said not to worry because it was all spent on us. At this point, I had to dip into the savings I set aside for our daughter\u2019s birthday to cover expenses. Fast forward to later in the month, and I decided to take control of the finances for the next paycheck. I told my wife I would be handling the money for the next two paychecks so I could keep track of everything. I told her she could still take money from my wallet, but she would have to let me know how much and what it was for. She got upset, saying I don\u2019t trust her and that I was being selfish. A few days later, I discovered she was planning to pawn her necklace to help her sister pay off her debt. I tried to open up a conversation by asking about her sister\u2019s situation, hoping she would tell me about the necklace. Eventually, I directly asked if she planned to pawn it to help her sister, and she admitted it. I told her I was against it because we were already in a tough spot financially, and we needed the necklace for our daughter\u2019s birthday. That led to an argument, and she said she\u2019d rather not celebrate our daughter\u2019s birthday than not help her sister. I tried to explain that it\u2019s okay to help others, but it can\u2019t come at the cost of our own financial stability. She became really angry and said she wasn\u2019t willing to understand or give me a chance to explain. She accused me of not trusting her and being selfish, and we\u2019ve been at odds since then. On top of all this, she\u2019s been acting childish in this situation. She insists on not touching our shared money, which we are supposed to spend as part of our budget, but then complains about having it difficult. When I called her out on this behavior, I made it very clear that she needs to grow up and be more responsible. I\u2019ve been feeling hurt because I feel like I made my plans clear and that I\u2019m just trying to keep us financially stable.

        "selftext": "I (21M) moved out at 18 for work and college. My family always praised how independent and happy I became. Two years ago, I started dating a high school friend (we\u2019re both men), and a year later, he moved in. I hid our relationship because my family is from a small conservative town and has outdated views\u2014my dad thinks LGBT+ people \u201cjust do it for attention.\u201d Last weekend, I finally told them. I started by explaining I\u2019m *aroace*, which is why I never introduced anyone before. They said they didn\u2019t want me to be alone and should give more people a chance. Then I revealed I\u2019ve had a boyfriend for two years. The irony? The type of relationship they always described as perfect for me is exactly the one I have. Their reaction was awful. My dad prayed at the table and went silent. My mom cried in her room, saying I ruined her dream of grandkids (even though I told them years ago I don\u2019t want kids). When I got home, she texted: *Your dad is really upset and won\u2019t accept this. Please give us time. You\u2019re always welcome at home, but [my boyfriend] coming wouldn\u2019t be good. I love you, even if it\u2019s not what I expected, and I just ask you to respect us too.* I just replied *Ok, I understand.* But I don\u2019t know if I do. I feel like my happiness is something they need to digest. Now, I\u2019m considering not visiting them or allowing them in my home until they accept my boyfriend. It seems fair\u2014if my relationship isn\u2019t accepted in their house, then they shouldn\u2019t be welcome in mine until they respect it. But part of me feels guilty, like I might be \u201casking too much\u201d from people with such a closed mindset. The immediate issue: tomorrow, they\u2019re delivering a fridge (a gift from last year) while my boyfriend and I are at work. I\u2019ve tried hiring delivery before, but it\u2019s hard to carry a fridge up three flights of stairs. I suspect they\u2019ll wait for us to get home, and I *don\u2019t* want to see them. After everything, I don\u2019t want to pretend things are normal. AITA for refusing to see them and cutting contact until they accept my boyfriend? EDIT RESPONSE TO COMMENTS: I\u2019ve seen a lot of responses in a short time\u2014thank you to everyone who took the time to reply. I wanted to add some missing details and context that I left out in the original post. * **English is not my first language**, so I didn\u2019t realize that cutting off sounds extreme. That\u2019s not what I meant\u2014I don\u2019t plan to completely cut them out of my life, just to stop visiting them or having them over until they accept my boyfriend (we live two hours apart).* As I mentioned, my boyfriend was my **high school friend**, and my dad never liked him, even before we were dating. He used to call him the Brazilian equivalent of *faggot* behind his back and got angry whenever I mentioned his name. I lost a lot of friendships because of my family's homophobia, but this was the first one I refused to let go of just because my dad disapproved.* The reason I decided to tell them **after two years** is that they kept giving me positive feedback about my emotional well-being and quality of life. So I thought, *if they\u2019ve been so happy with my changes since I\u2019ve been with him, why would they see him as a bad influence?** One of the worst things my mom said to me privately was: *I never thought about having another child, but after what you told me, I reconsidered.* That really hurt me.* I **do believe they can change** (especially my mom), but I know it will be difficult. They\u2019ve always struggled to understand even basic things about me, like the fact that I\u2019m **introverted and autistic** with sensory sensitivities. Ever since I was a kid, they would drag me to loud parties, and when I got overwhelmed or didn\u2019t enjoy them, they blamed me for not trying to have fun. Even after I got my **autism diagnosis** as an adult, my dad still refuses to acknowledge it.* Since I moved out, I **pay for my own college, rent, and transportation** without any family support (aside from occasional gifts that I never ask for).* About the **fridge**, it was a **Christmas gift** they bought for me, but the Brazilian postal service kept saying they would deliver it and never did. I even took time off work to be home, only for them to never show up. Eventually, my mom got a refund and bought another one closer to her house (two hours away). They had already planned to deliver it before I even brought up this issue. I feel like **I should take it so they can\u2019t use it as leverage against me.*** They have **a spare key to my place**, which was never an issue before (my mistake in hindsight). I\u2019m now considering staying home tomorrow to receive the fridge myself and **take my key back.** Again, thanks for all the insights and perspectives\u2014I really appreciate it.",

        "selftext": "Writing the title makes me feel like I'm the asshole no matter what. But it's not exactly about the clothing. Let me describe my situation first. I (34M) met my wife (36F) 4 years ago. We got ~~engaged~~ married after 1 year together. We have a 2-year-old daughter. We\u2019re both working freelance, and her income is usually two or three times more than mine. We work equally in terms of time spent. When one person is working, the other takes care of the baby. As she earns more, she spends more. She treats herself and the family members (1 child and 2 cats) at her level of income. For example, we dine out a bit too much (I try to cook, not bad, but she usually doesn\u2019t feel like eating at home). She loves to buy expensive fruit over the affordable ones, or buy costly clothing, bags, or a top-of-the-line rice cooker. At the same time, she wants to feel equal in providing for the family. I try my best (I always sleep later and wake up earlier) to meet her expectations (and maybe haven't met them yet?), so I always run out of money every month. Every time I bring this into conversation, it\u2019s always \u201cI have the right to use my money.\u201d There's no way to get her to spend at the same rate as my income (which is above average in my city). -------- She used to work in the fashion industry, so she\u2019s a bit picky about what she wears. I never thought about sitting down with her to write down every item on her wishlist. Because what she can buy, she already buys; and what she can\u2019t buy, I can\u2019t help her with. At least, that\u2019s what I think. So, today, she bought a Chanel lipstick (first time after 3 years) and I (intended to say let me pay) asked for the price, and she replied $50. I said, \u201cWow, a $50 lipstick? Normal people can never use this.\u201d I can\u2019t afford it at the moment, so I didn\u2019t suggest paying for her either. She felt disappointed because of what I said, and because I never buy her any significant things except on birthdays (her last birthday\u2019s gift was a small necklace worth 1/5 of my monthly income) and some special occasions in the 4 years we've been living together. Apart from occasional flowers, I rarely buy her any significant gifts in daily life because I never save enough for this. I mean, it\u2019s not my priority to buy her excessive stuff that she doesn\u2019t really need. So, AITA for not putting my wife's girly stuff more on top of my priority? ----  **EDIT:** As everybody mention about the 50$ lipstick, I must say it's not a big deal for something you will use in 3 years. I just not prepare for that (I thought around 20$ to 30$), so it shock me and I say it out so unthoughtfully. Yep, so her point is not about this lipstick but the fact that I rarely buy her nice stuffs apart from special events. As I can see, my reason as not saving enough for this kind of stuffs is weak and kind of the excuses. On the other hand, we should have more conversation on how the expense is splitted. **EDIT2:** I read all of your comments and feel very thankful. Since this is the first time I tell my story in Reddit and I don't know what to expect. I just try to put on a short version of the situation for not wasting your time. Apparently, it lacks of some information and clarification. I want to answers some FAQ below and give my conclusion. **1. Is she usually have gifts for me? What are those?**  She gifted me many shirts (5 to 7) and pants (~3) in the first year we met, not so after that. She gift me 3 birthday presents - a coat, a helmet, and a phone (a decent 2nd-hand phone I choose to replace my broken one). I don't really remember anything else recently. Now looking back, I can tell how she's obsessed with fashion and want to put nice clothes on me. I feel thankful, for sure, but you see, those things are practically good, but too boring.  My birthdays gift for her is an Instax Camera, a wooden music box with horses cart riding the marrying couple (which turn out to be our's daughter favorite toy...), and a necklace (her choice). I tried to be creative. **2. Do I know that what she want is only a tangible gift to show her my love?** Yes, I know. She told this directly to me. In my defend, I want to shout out that my financial strain caused by following her lifestyle so I could hardly budget anything even for myself (I'm not doing that, I'm writing here to ask for your help instead). I bought her flowers once every two months. I bought snacks and small gifts (funny key chains, etc) occasionally. But those things is too easy to buy so maybe she dismissed it. **3. Do we have joint account? Do we really pay 50/50?** We used to have a joint account (and we put 50/50 into it), somehow it's complicated to handle it so we dismiss it after 2 or 3 months of marriage and spend on our own. Yes, we target for 50/50 on essential things. The renting, the kids (daughter and cats) expense, the market's foods and dine out meal, health care, daily stuffs,.... It's vary depend on every months. But I could say she paying more in general. It could be something between 55/45 to 60/40.  Even I pay less, my money is running out frequently. (For example, she pay 1000$ and I pay 800$). She still have a big deal of money to spend on clothes and sandals and accessories for her and our daughter (more than what their need), expensive fruits and snacks, milk tea,... After that, she still remains some for saving. **4. Does she a materialistic person?** No, I don't think so. I think it's because our love language is un-align.  For example, I touch her and say I love her a lot, but she doesn't enjoy doing that. She usually said it's not the words matter, the actions (gifts?) matter. I spend time with her, listen to her more than enough, and she think that's just obvious couple's obligations. Maybe I should know better about her love language. **5. My conclusion** As many of you pointed out, the question is why I'm still staying here, in the financial strain situation.  I must have a real talk with her (or us with counselor) to set up an equitable expense, not equally expense. Following that, we should have a joint account. I should also budget for some gifts, which is her go-to love language. Thank you very much for supporting me. I can't see how I get through this without your words. I hope I can give you a best UPDATE as I can.",

We've had a disagreement years ago regarding my mental condition (where I'm from having a mental condition is still frowned upon by older people, so when it was confirmed, my mom couldn't accept that I was deficient; I think she got over it already, but we didn't talk about it -- or anything meaningful, for that matter).  I'm not not talking to her as in a silent treatment thing. I'm just... she's *loud*, and we've never been close to begin with, and the older I get the more detached I become (that's part of my mental thing). I live not another city level of far away, but far enough that we can't meet by coincidence (every time we need to meet even briefly it has to be organised). When she needs help, I'm here (which is not often because most of these cases are handled by my little sister (32F) who's probably the most sane and responsible adult in our little family, and sis lives with her). The thing is, I've probably talked to her like 3 times in the past year, once for her birthday and then for needing help thing my sis couldn't handle. We don't exchange messages. It is the way I prefer things, but I'm wondering if I've been hurting her. Sis seems okay, she calls me like once a month (I wonder if she has it scheduled lol). She wasn't a bad mother. I can't blame her for failing to notice/adress my mental condition (it was aparent since my childhood, but it wasn't just my mother, there were qualified teachers and psychologists at school who thought that my weirdness was totally okay because I've got good grades), I just... I don't have enough emotions and expressions to be a normal person instead of a brick wall, and her emotions are so overboard to me (sis sometimes gets tired too) that I can't really be okay for more than two days in the same house. To be fair, I can get tired of pretty much anyone in the same space with me, like sis would visit for work matters, stays couple of weeks and I'm celebrating when she goes back. So. I am comfortable with barely holding any contact, because that's how I feel (or rather don't feel). Am I the asshole towards my more normal human-to-human interaction-oriented family?",

        "selftext": "PSA: English isn\u2019t my first language, so please be kind. I (26F) have been married to my husband (32M) for almost a year now, and we\u2019ve been together for five years. We come from different countries and cultures. We met in 2020 in my hometown while he was there for work and got stuck due to COVID. At the time, I was doing my MBA. By the time I graduated and started job hunting, it was time for him to go back. He wasn\u2019t sure when or if he\u2019d return, and neither of us wanted to do long distance, so we decided I wouldn\u2019t take a job and would go with him instead. I started working in his business and received a salary. We traveled a lot for work and were together 24/7. In 2022, he and his business partners sold that business and made good money. My husband already owned some property, and after selling the business, he bought more and made various investments. He works a lot\u2014he\u2019s a professor, a business owner, a trader, and much more. Over time, I started helping him with almost everything. I didn\u2019t get a salary, but he always told me, \u201cMy money is your money,\u201d and I never had to ask for anything. I always had more than enough, and he even helps my family. Still, it sometimes bothered me that I didn\u2019t personally own anything. In 2023, we got engaged, and in the summer of 2024, we got married. That same year, he bought another business with his friend and my FIL (75M) as partners. The business needed a lot of setup and administration work, but my husband was too busy to handle it. His friend works full-time, so he couldn\u2019t help much, and his father is a silent partner. Naturally, all the work fell on me. For the past 10 months, I\u2019ve been working on this business 24/7 hiring people, managing marketing, setting everything up, solving endless problems, and doing a million other things. I don\u2019t mind not owning anything in the business, we\u2019re married, and what\u2019s his is mine but what does bother me is how my FIL treats me. During meetings, when I present ideas and get everyone up to speed, my husband always acknowledges my work, saying things like, \u201cThanks to OP, we\u2019re able to run this business.\u201d But my FIL constantly downplays my role, acting as if I\u2019m just an employee. He even tries to take credit, saying buying the business was his idea. Last week, he did the same thing. Downplaying  my role and even telling me to take notes, as if I were some intern and not the person leading the meeting. That\u2019s when I started thinking: if my husband expects me to keep working on this business, maybe I should ask for some shares in it. I brought this up to my mom, and she lost it on me. She said, \u201cHe\u2019s your husband, why would you ask him for that? You shouldn\u2019t pay attention to your FIL. What\u2019s his is yours, and you should be thankful because he\u2019s so kind.\u201d In my culture, men are put on a pedestal even when they don\u2019t deserve it, and my husband is amazing, so of course, my mom is biased. I don\u2019t really have friends I can talk to about this, so, internet strangers AITA for asking for shares in his business?",

        "selftext": "So i (15f) have a best friend (also 15f), who got a moped last summer, after turning 15. We had fun summer riding it together and going to places and so on. One day she sends me a message telling me how her dog had peed on her helmet, because she had left it on the floor. She comes to pick me up from my house the same day and complained, how the helmet is ruined, and how it still smells like dog pee even after she had washed it. After she had picked me up, we decided to go to her place. After the whole day of complaining about the helmet, she told me that her parents went to get her a new one. I was a bit shocked, because the helmet did cost a 150$ and they didint really try that hard to get the smell out. Then she told me that she was just gonna throw the old helmet away, so i asked her if i could have it, since my helmet is old and pretty scratched and i tought that i could atleast try to get the smell off of it. She told me that i could have it and !keep in mind that i asked if she wants any money for it and she said no! She even asked her mother if it would be okay and her mom also said yes. I asked her few times if she is 100% sure that she wants to give it to me and that she doesn\u00b4t want any money for it, and she kept saying yes. I was very happy that i finally had a new helmet and when i got home i immediately washed the helmet twice and also left it to my balcony for a week just to get the smell out of it. Finally it worked. I completely got the smell off the helmet. The next day when me and my best friend were hanging out again, i told her that i got the smell out of it. for my suprise she wasn\u00b4t happy for me. Infact she actually asked it back. She said that it is still hers and that she actually wants to sell it now. I was really shocked and i refused to give it back to her, because she had gave it to me. I told her that i could have gave her some money for it, but she didn\u00b4t want it. She just kept on saying that i should give it back, because she wants to sell it and that it is still her helmet and stuff like that. I still refused, because i was the one who got the smell off of it and kept pointing out the fact that she had gave it to me. We have had couple of small arguments about this even after summer and now i really just need someone elses opinion. So please tell me Am i the asshole? P.s Im sorry if there is a lot of mistakes. English is not my first language.   UPDATE:  So thank you to everyone who has told me some good ideas what to do. Today i started talking to my friend about the helmet again. I wanted to see how she reacts and what she woud say, so i just said something like i will buy new glasses to wear with the helmet you gave to me. After saying that she said no i will take it back. We had an argument again and i told her that she literally gave it to me and that im the one who cleaned it. She then said that she could give me like 20$ for it, but that it wasn\u00b4t a gift and that after she had gave it to me her mom had said that she could have sold it. I told her that she had literally given it to me. So it basically was a gift. After this argument we both were kind of giving eachother silent treatment while we were walking back to her house. We had made plans earlier this week that we would go to the gym after school and we had been talking about it even at school. Suddently when we are walking to her house to get her gym clothes, she suddently says im tired so i won\u00b4t come to the gym. I was really pissed because an hour ago she was not too tired to go. I was getting really annoyed so i said fuck you and turned around.  And for everyone saying that if i give it back i should pee in it first, i definetly will. The first thing i will do is just not talk about it and if she mentions it i will just keep telling her no.' If that doesn\u00b4t work i will pee in it or make my dog pee in it and then give it back.  Thank you everyone who has responded to this!! ",

        "selftext": "First of all I love my family very much.Over the years I\u2019ve realized past childhood wounds that I\u2019ve had due to my upbringing and never being taught about boundaries or being unaware of manipulation. Now that I\u2019m older (39 F) I\u2019ve healed those wounds and try to maintain a healthy environment for myself.  My mom\u2019s mother was very manipulative amongst other things and would do and say things to all of us that were messed up. For example, when I was a kid she started calling me Pippa at one point and then told me it was the name of the dog in her romance novel.  Now my mom is starting to do messed up things like that as well to mess with my self esteem, always acknowledging that what she did was something her mom would do to her. When I ask why then is she repeating that behavior and doing it to me, she changes the subject. I\u2019ve asked her before to go to therapy and she says that \u2018she has in the past\u2019. I\u2019ve told her if she doesn\u2019t then it will put a strain on our relationship and I\u2019m ignored.  My dad and I are closer but he always wants things to be happy and chipper, which doesn\u2019t leave room for any other emotions. If upset emotions are expressed then there must be something wrong with you.  I\u2019ve been going through a lot as of late with job issues, a restraining order from an ex, and moving to different state. I told my parents this past year to not expect me to visit this summer and Xmas since I knew money would be very tight. I asked them to respect that and to not ask me non stop if I\u2019ll be visiting. Sure enough they continued to ignore my request continued to ask every time they called (which is about every other week).  I repeated to them to stop asking me and they continue to anyway. They offer to pay for the flight, but since I\u2019m freelance, any day away means that I might not have enough money for rent. For November , my family came out and I cooked a feast for everyone. We all had a great time, even though once again my mother decided to randomly interrupt me asking me if I cut my eyebrows, while I was talking about something serious. She once again said that was something her mom would do to her.  She then asked me again, to which I replied \u201care you really asking me?\u201d And she said no. The rest of my family just sort of ignores these behaviors and my sister gets super clicky with my mom.  After that I was repeatedly asked if I was coming home for the holidays and I reminded them of what I told them earlier in the year. They continued to ignore me and ask up until the week before Xmas. Now that it\u2019s February, my parents have been hounding me non stop to come visit or for me to go visit them. I told them that I\u2019m trying to figure out my life and to give me space and I\u2019m ignored. I tell them they\u2019re adding stress with the constant asking and adding other things on to my plate with my birthday coming up and now I\u2019m sick. AITA?",

        "selftext": "Here me out first before passing judgment. A few months ago, my grandfather turned 80. My brother and I have been living overseas for several years, and this was the first time in a few years that we were both back in town at the same time. As it coincided with our grandfather's birthday, our mother thought it would be great to have a birthday dinner to include my grandfather's children, grandchildren, and great grandchildren as well as their partners and family members, if any.  Since my uncle (grandfather's son) and his wife are usually the busiest, we let them decide the day and time on the one weekend when my brother and I were both in town. They chose Saturday dinner, which everyone then quickly confirmed through a family group chat. This was one month before the party. As the date had been set, I then planned my own time back in town accordingly. Nine days before my grandfather's party when I was back in town, my mother suddenly says that my uncle just messaged the group chat and changed the time to Saturday lunch because it was winter and cold and lunch time would be better for our grandfather. I told her that I was not free for lunch and that I was sure that my brother couldn't make it too, as he had just called me a few days earlier to make sure that our grandfather's party was indeed Saturday dinner. My mother quickly called my uncle to tell him that my brother and I couldn't make it. My uncle then got very angry and immediately said that he would cancel the dinner. 10 minutes later, he sends a message to the group chat saying that (and I quote) that \u201cDue to everyone having prior arrangement on such an important day for grandpa\u2019s birthday and can\u2019t make it to the event, we have decided to cancel the birthday celebration\u201d.  I quickly decided that I would still want to have dinner with my grandfather and confirmed it privately with everyone else, and everyone was fine with it. I then messaged the group chat the next day saying that I was still going ahead with the dinner and anyone who can make it can come and just let me know. I got radio silence from my uncle and his wife.  But AITA for not changing my plans so that the birthday party could be held at lunch? By the way, I thoroughly enjoyed the party and I assume everyone else did too because we didn't need to deal with my uncle and his wife's presence.",

I've always wanted to do one so I figured this year I could do one with my kids and my husband. Nothing real formal just maybe a cake and a day at Dave and busters or something like that. My husband was so happy he of course told his coworkers about the pregnancy. They congratulated him and offered said they would love to throw me a baby shower. Apparently they started planning right away and requested I make a registry at Amazon. I honestly didn't feel comfortable with that, I am just grateful for anything I get. They planned for it to be at the office which is a funeral home. That part does bother me a little, what really bothers me are his coworkers. My husband often comes home and complains about the way they treat him and his staff. From our experience the office staff at funeral homes never respect the guys working outside. Anyhow I told my husband that I don't feel comfortable going because I don't actually know them. What I do know about them is what he has told me and they don't seem very nice. He rolled his eyes and was like  who cares, it's a chance to get free stuff. I still didn't feel comfortable but I said I'd go with him. My husband then told me he wasn't going to be there and I immediately said I'm not going. I appreciate that he wanted to do something for me but him not being there was a deal breaker. It's been two weeks and he asked about it and I just asked him to thank them for the thought but if rather do something with just my family. He really wants me to go but I really don't want to. So would I be a jerk for not going? ",

        "selftext": "I know this is gonna sound super petty but let me give you the details first. I (21f) live at home with my mother (52f) and sister (16f) along with my 2 dogs and their new puppy. They got this cocker spaniel back around October, she's about 5 or 6 months now, if I'm correct and with me working at a pet store, I'm pretty knowledgeable about the dos and don'ts when it comes to dogs, not an expert though. But since the puppy has been here, I've tried my best to be assistive while also letting my sister, who is the primary care taker of the dog, take the lead when it came to training, grooming, and the ect. But she can definitely be a bit lazy, as teenagers are, so if the dog needed to be let out to play n use the bathroom after being locked in her play pin all day (because my sister sleeps for hours on end), I do so.  I also let them both come in and use my discount at work for the puppy, which is at cost and get food for free every other month. But recently, she's been getting really short with me, and I'm not a huge fan of the attitude when all I'm trying to do is help. Today it hit a head when I woke up to a call from her saying that her dog along with my dog's were out and about down stairs (the main living space) by themselves, with if I remember correctly, her saying that her dog was still eating and mines were choosing not to. Now mind you, by this time, both of my dogs are in my room as I'm half sleep and the puppy is by herself doing God knows what, and possibly getting into their food which is different due to allergies, so I jump from bed and rush downstairs, apparently hanging up the phone in the process which I didn't mean to do, but not before saying why didn't you just wake me up to say this instead of leaving the house and calling me. I then go downstairs to find the puppy is ok, did containers secure, and 2 full bowls of food put out of reach.  I then got this series of text messages saying I'm lucky she even tries to feed my dogs, calling me dramatic among other things. And I simply tell her I help out with her dog out of kindness and reciprocity, and barley the latter since I've come home with my dog's not fed or takin outside, without so much as a thank you or a kind word my way unless she needs something and that I'm done helping out with her dog and with her attitude, and that whatever she wants done to and with her dog, she can do herself, including arranging for someone to stop at our house to let her dog out or use any products that are meant for my dog's on hers. Also stating she and my mom can now pay full retail  price for anything regarding her dog, which I'm sorry to say I have held that over her head a few times in the past due to her terrible attitude not just towards me but the things I do for her. Am I the a-hole for taking this step to the detriment of this puppy?? Am I being too petty even though this has been happening for what seems like months? ",

A friend of mine (30 m) was also invited, I would like to add that he was already on quite some thin ice, to make it simple I will refer to him as Bob We share 2 mutuals friends (21 f) and (25 m) to make it simple I will refer to them as Lynn, and Jeff. We used to be quite close all three, having Lynn move into my appartment complex made us only closer, unfortunately Bob decided to make a new groupchat purely to not include me. When confronted he denied of the existence, which upset Lynn due to us being really close and just not liking it at all. Despite all this Bob was still invited to my party, because I didn\u2019t want to make this \u201cbigger\u201d then it was. I rented a location for my birthday, which due to the rain became quite muddy outside and had a lot of gaps in the ground, it was also really dark outside He decided without communicating to me, that he would do a photoshoot on that terrain with some people I also invited, I simply asked them why because a birthday party doesn\u2019t seem like the time nor place to do a photoshoot imo. I wouldn\u2019t mind people taking pictures at all, with phones since I understand taking selfies/videos! But he took all his camera equipment with him, including lights without any communication. I as a photographer myself, would never take my equipment with me, at a private event like birthday parties unless the host asked. Or unless I asked for permission and it was fine My boyfriend kindly asked him to stop, because it was just weird to just shoot on a birthday party without any proper notice. Eventually he came back into the party, looking all upset for the last 3 hours, and just keeping looking at his phone which was just very awkward for all the guests being there. When asked about it by others he kept claiming he was getting \u201ckicked out\u201d which mind you he only got kindly asked to stop, due to the terrain being dangerous etc etc Eventually he left without saying goodbye, or honesty anything I kindly messaged him, because stuff like this wouldn\u2019t have happened if there was any communication. He claimed that \u201che was an adult so he didn\u2019t need to ask for permission, and that he was done getting told what he could do and not\u201d He ended up blocking me and Lynn on everything because he was upset, later I however also find out that he was bragging to my guests about going on a date with a 19 year old, so I don\u2019t know whether I dodged a bullet, or whether I am truly in the wrong.",

        "selftext": "The company I work at is made up of two sister companies: Company A and Company B. I work at Company A. I referred my close friend (let\u2019s call them Alex) to jobs at both companies in September. I organised Alex to have a conversation with my supervisor, and they eventually got a job at company B. For this, I got a bonus (circa $1500). As I consider them a close friend, I offered to share the bonus with Alex so we could go on holiday.  In December, another friend (not a close friend, let\u2019s call them Toni) contacted me about a referral. I referred Toni to several jobs across Company A and Company B, organising meetings with colleagues on the teams he wished to join in company A. I told Alex about this and they said that was exciting as they also know Toni - again, not close friends. Over the Christmas Holidays, I mentioned to Alex that I\u2019d love for them to come to a festival with me this year. I had asked a few times in previous years. This time, Alex agreed and asked to borrow the money ($400) from the bonus and they would pay it back. I agreed and Alex bought their ticket.  The next week, Alex said they might camp with another group of friends at the festival. I thought this was a bit of a rubbish thing to do but Alex assured me they would most likely camp with me.  Last week, Toni eventually landed a job in Company B. The same day, I saw Alex and mentioned this and how I had referred Toni to the job. In Toni\u2019s case, I was not going to share the bonus as we are not close and I have a large bill to pay.  Alex mentioned they had also referred Toni to the role and had contacted HR about the bonus but were told that HR would not be paying out. I said that can\u2019t be right and said I would talk to HR the next day, promising Alex that I would split the money with them as we had both referred Toni.  The next day, I spoke to HR and they confirmed that the bonus was already confirmed to be paid out to Alex and Toni had signed the documentation to confirm this.  Having followed the referral process myself, I know that Alex would have had to sign the documentation prior to Toni signing it. That\u2019s when I realised Alex had been dishonest with me. I contacted Alex relaying what HR had said and asked if they would be willing to split the bonus with me as I had offered before. Alex responded saying they wouldn\u2019t expect me to split the bonus had Toni got a job in Company A. I couldn\u2019t believe it.  Following some back and forth, I said I didn\u2019t have to split my bonus with Alex but I did because they are my close friend and I thought it would be nice. I also said that their behaviour was dishonest and selfish. Alex said they would pay me back the $400 and I can keep their half of my bonus.  At this stage, it wasn\u2019t about the money. It was about the dishonesty. I find it hard to stick up for myself at times, but unfortunately this is not the first time Alex has been dishonest. I reiterated my point and Alex denied being dishonest and accused me of calling them names. We have since agreed not to talk for a while.  Have I overreacted?",

Forced by my parents, Emma chose medicine and I chose engineering. I was meant to do my studies abroad like Emma but because she kept failing, she had to stay back causing financial strain on my father. So my study abroad was cut short.But I graduated and secured a job asap. Got married and settled abroad. Never asked for a penny from my parents from the moment I started earning because I didn't want to pressure my father.  Emma was struggling to complete her studies. I think it is at this point she started to develop a deep sense of entitlement and resentment towards my parents and me.She finally manipulated my dad into renting her an apartment in the city so that she can study better.She would often call me to say she hasn't even eaten properly cause she doesn't have money and I'd send her money right away. Recently my family visited me.Emma visited me earlier than my parents. At this time, I was also expecting a baby. Emma acted like me being pregnant was an annoyance cause I couldn't take her around. regardless I even took her to see the city lights at mid night. My husband was concerned for my well-being and was very upset of how I was being treated.Emma would always come home saying she has no money(even though my father gave her money to spend here).she treated me like atm citing that she has done things for me (organising my wedding) so I SHOULD do everything for her and she sacrificed her youth to take care of my parents while I built my life here. After my parents came, I realised that she basically gets anything she wants from dad.I even found out that my father has given her much more money than she told me.I was upset.Even when I'm in pain,Emma very nonchalantly asks so where are we going today. That was it for me because I felt that she is treating my unborn child poorly. So I started ignoring her.I did some petty stuff like refusing to wash her clothes in the washer. Seeing this,Dad said he treated both of us equally which is not true at all because they get fancy gifts for her on her birthday but I haven't even received a card on mine for many years.   I don't think she will ever understand that me building up a life in a different country with zero family support was a sacrifice, because my father wouldn't have had the means to spend on her if he sent me money as well.   Recently I lost my beloved father. He wanted me to take care of my mum and my sister. I did speak to Emma during funeral arrangements, things have turned extremely sour.Emma is handling many of my dad's assets that I don't even know about because she wants everything for her claiming that she was the one who took care of him. So yeah, I do not talk to her and She never reached out too.I feel bad because my dad must be very unhappy. AITA?",

For a few years we didn't get to see each other much because we went to college on opposite sides of the country, but I moved to her city last year so we really got to catch up with each other.  Hayley will be turning 25 in a week so we - along with some other friends - started planning her birthday party a while ago. She wanted to have a rather big party so that she could invite all of her friends groups, but we couldn't find anywhere to have it and she lives in a small apartment. I on the other hand have a house, it's not that big but it's big enough to host the party. So our friends started bringing it up and said that we could throw the party at my house.  I was fine with that. I did find it kinda weird that they were the one to bring it up, because I personally wouldn't suggest throwing a party in someone else's house unless they were the one to suggest it, but it didn't really matter. So I said yes, my only conditions were that the party didn't turn into chaos, that no one got too drunk, and that they helped me clean up the next day. Everyone was fine with that so we agreed on it.  Yesterday, Hayley sent me a text to tell me how many people would be there. That's when she asked me if I could get my cat out of the house for the night, because one of her friends from college is allergic. I told her that I didn't have anywhere else to leave him, but that I could make sure that he stayed upstairs while we were downstairs. I also told her that my cat is very shy and easily scared so there's no way he'd get close to her friend.  She then told me that I could just leave him with my parents and then go back to get him the next day. My parent's house is about an hour and a half drive and there's just no way I'd drive a total of 6 hours in one weekend. I told her that it really wasn't possible for me to leave him with my parents but that he would be locked upstairs and I'd deep clean the house to make sure there's no cat hair anywhere. I also told her that she should've told me earlier and I could've found another solution, but now the party is in less than a week.   She told me that I wasn't being helpful and that I was ruining her party, and she's been bitching about me to a lot of our mutual friends. I told her that I had no obligation to let her do the party at my house and I kindly accepted to do so, so the least she could do was to be grateful. She hasn't replied since. Most of our friends agree with me, but I also feel a bit guilty. I don't know if I'm in the wrong here and I don't know what else I can do.  ",

They leave for work at 3:00 a.m. and leave the baby with me until my mom gets home at 8:00 a.m. Then my mom takes over until they get back from work at 2:00 p.m. My mom works 12-hour night shifts. I do this once or twice a week, depending on my mom's schedule. Mind you, I did not sign up for this. They pretty much said, She's not doing anything anyway, so she can take care of the baby while my mom gets home. I'm currently not working, hence why I'm home and living off savings. I also have had health issues since November. I will be having surgery soon. This is another issue. I clearly told my mom that I did not want people coming in and out of our house because if I get sick, my surgery will be canceled. She does not care, and my brother and his girlfriend were sick last week, coughing and sneezing all over the house. Now, this weekend, the baby has started to get sick. I just texted them that one of them will have to call off work to take care of the baby because what if she gets worse? I know for a fact that they are still going to leave her and my brother is going to get pissed and start with the name calling.  You're a selfish *****, she's your niece.

When I got there, I was stopped by one of his neighbors, he said hi and asked how I was doing, I replied I'm good he thought it was great, he offers me a cup of water, I said yes, I stepped into his little halfway of his frount door to get out of the heat.  When he gave me a cup of water, we both sat down on a couple of milk crates outside, my bf's mother saw what I was doing and told her daughter (my bf's sister) and then I then said my goodbyes to the neighborhood and whent over to my bf's house.  He was still doing yard work so I whent inside and greeted his mother she's an old skinny lady who has one of those little button things that she presses in order for her to talk. She had half of her voice box removed due to cancer, she's a beautiful being, I adore her so much, but then, when I whent into town the next day, I got a voice message from my bf's sister who I live next door to asking me about yesterday's activities.  I said yes he did offer me a glass of water and yes I did accept the offer, I didn't want to distract my bf from doing yard work so we sat down outside and had a cup of water together she then replied with another voice note  yelling at me that's a huge red flag!! By our can't do that!!  I replied I'm sorry? How is that a red flag? I ha a meeting with my behavior practitioner and told her abouthit as well, she didn't see how that was a red flag as well,  What do you think Reddit? Am I the AHole for accepting a glass of water from my boyfriends neighbors on a hot day? ",

        "selftext": "I, 17F, got into an argument with my mom about taking me to work. This happened Friday evening. My whole house is sick, except my mom. All of our symptoms are different yet similar. I have recurring headaches, runny nose, sore throat, and severe body aches. My body aches are so serve that tossing and turning in bed feels like a chore. I can\u2019t sit up or lay down for too long without feeling incredibly sore. No joke it took me like 40 minutes to get dressed for work on Friday. Thursday night my manager asks if I can come in Friday night for a shift. I told her I was sick and didn\u2019t want to spread it but if they really needed me, I\u2019d go in and wear a mask. She said she\u2019d see if she could get someone else and would let me know Friday morning. While I was texting my manager, I told my mom I would only accept the shift if she could take me and pick me up, which she agreed to. Now, in my apartments you have to have a sticker to park in your parking space and the stickers have recently been upgraded, which costs a little money to renew. With all that being said, my mother has been parking on a street until she can renew hers. Long story short, my manager can\u2019t find anyone else and I\u2019m her last option. I agreed and my mother also agrees to take and pick me up from work. As my mother and I both get in the car to take me to work, she starts going on about how she might lose her parking space on the street. I thought this was weird since she knew her parking space would be at risk of being taken if she took me. She just kept going on about how selfish it is to even ASK for a ride to work knowing her current parking situation. Since it was raining pretty hard this day and I already felt like crap, I didn\u2019t even think about getting on the bus. I told my mom that if taking me was such a problem, why\u2019d she even agree in the first place?? We kept going back and forth and I was seriously sitting there thinking: what are we even fighting about? We were fine with each other all day, her attitude literally came out of nowhere. I get to work and ask my mother if she\u2019s still picking me up. She says yes but if my manager can take me home, which they usually do, then that would be even better.  Coincidentally, my manager offered me a ride home a little into my shift. Around this time, my mother had texted me saying she got her spot back. I told her she should apologize for the way she was acting but she didn\u2019t feel I needed an apology, typical. Long story short, I ended up going home early because I started to feelworse. I was incredibly dizzy and felt nauseous. I caught a ride home from a friend. Once I got home, my mom was acting like nothing happened, which was common of her. She never apologizes or really even acknowledges our fights, she just brushes it off until our next one. My family has arguments and fights like this all the time, sometimes worse. We\u2019ve literally had 3 more arguments since this one. Soooo, am I the AITA for asking for a ride to work?",

WIBTA if i expressed all this to her? update: we ended up having a conversation in person, i did not bring up how she let someone sleep on the couch, but we discussed her having her friends over during school nights. she said she will push it back to a bit later and they will move to her room when they are done with dinner.",

At one point things got heated between her husband and I, and i brought up how the behavior started with my dad back when he was in the hospital. My point was to emphasize how it's been a pattern of behavior. I will say though, the way I brought it up was immature, I was reacting to him calling me immature after attempting to let them know of the hurtful behavior. Now they are calling me soulless, cruel, etc. because I brought up our father and she can't get closure.  Her husband then proceeded to say it crossed a line and went below the belt for bringing up my dad, and my older brother in a past fight. I totally forgot about that fight so I didn't even realize until a few days later what he meant. A while back we had a huge fight with all our family over my sister's behavior towards my parents, and I did bring up how our deceased brother felt the same as I as we had talked about it together before.I do think that was might a been a low blow, but I remember apologizing. So essentially, am ITA to bring up deceased family members feelings, that they told me directly, when arguing about hurtful behaviors? ",

It was one of the hardest, most painful things I\u2019ve ever done. The day was filled with crying and prayers\u2026. I also tend to deep clean in stressful moments so I deep cleaned the garage.  After everything, I called my dad looking for comfort. I just wanted to hear that I\u2019d be okay, that someone was there for me. Instead, he told me to \u201cbe strong\u201d and \u201cget over it.\u201d On top of that, he made me feel like a terrible granddaughter, saying that he had to apologize to my grandma because I supposedly treated her terribly (which isn\u2019t true). That hurt more than I can even explain. I told him I needed support, just a simple \u201cI\u2019m here for you\u201d or \u201cYou\u2019re going to be okay.\u201d Instead, he told me I hadn\u2019t achieved anything in life yet, so why would he tell me he\u2019s proud of me? At one of the lowest moments of my life, he made me feel like I was nothing. This isn\u2019t new behavior. Whenever something bad happens, he always responds with, \u201cYou should\u2019ve listened to me\u201d or \u201cYou didn\u2019t take the keys I offered.\u201d He never offers warmth or reassurance, just cold, logical \u201clessons\u201d that make me feel worse.

        "selftext": "Throwaway. My ex-boyfriend and I had been dating for six years and living together for 3. l've been unhappy in our relationship for the past few months and finally decided it was time to break up with him. I broke up with him last week, and it's been extremely painful ever since. There have been a lot of tears and conversations, and trying to navigate moving out on top of everything has been hell. For context, I love my ex very much, but I felt breaking up was my only choice if I wanted to be happy as things were not getting better. On to the story! One of my friends had a bridal shower this weekend, and I could not be more excited for her. My ex-boyfriend and I have been good friends with this person and their fianc\u00e9 \u2014 we have even gone on vacations together. My friend is aware of my break-up and has seen first hand how much I have agonized over this decision. When I arrived at her bridal shower yesterday and started greeting other guests, I quickly realized that somehow everyone in the room already knew about my breakup. Throughout the night, I was approached by multiple people, even ones I barely know, who offered their condolences, told me they were proud of me, asked how my apartment search was going, and prompted me for details about my breakup and impending move. The MOH even pushed for details multiple times in front of the bride\u2019s family, even though I was very clearly trying to navigate away from the subject. The whole night felt like one of those scenes in high school when you walk into a room and notice people looking at you as if they've just been whispering about you. I played it off as best I could and tried to change the subject whenever possible. Apart from that, I would say the evening went fine and everyone had a lovely time celebrating the bride. However, since getting home yesterday, I can't help but feel really betrayed. It feels like my friend used my painful breakup as gossip and shared it with a lot of people who shouldn't know my personal business, especially since I'm not close with them in any way. Both my ex and I are real people with real feelings and our pain shouldn\u2019t be used as party gossip. I've also started receiving texts from people who attended the party, informing me that they've heard what happened and asking how I'm doing. While I understand their intentions are positive, this feels very invasive. These are her friends, not mine. I would have understood her sharing this with her partner or even a close mutual friend of ours, but this was much bigger than that. I texted her today and told her I could no longer be her bridesmaid or friend. Both her and the MOH think I overreacted. Now I\u2019m second guessing my decision and worried I was too rash \u2014 I just simply can\u2019t imagine treating a friend this way when they feel so vulnerable. Am I the asshole?",

        "selftext": "I 40 yo female and my husband 41 yo male have a constant battle over the temperature of the house during the winter heating season. I would ideally keep the house 65-70F unless it is super cold outside in which case I might go as high as 72-74F. The higher temp would be a rare exception for me. I do typically like to be cooler overall and wear fewer layers and lighter fabrics. He prefers to be warmer overall but wants to be able to lounge around the house in a t-shirt and sleep shorts when he is in for the evening. He rather adamantly insists that he is the sole controller of the thermostat of which there is only one for the whole house. He says growing up that he never had any choice in the temperature of his home and that as an adult he will always have the choice and control. This means that the thermostat has a locked out range of 72-80F and he typically maintains it at 77-79F and is \u201ccomfortable.\u201d He will occasionally make changes when I tell him how miserably uncomfortable I am at that temperature but his concession is typically only a couple of degrees to perhaps 76F.  He feels that my perception of it being too hot is entirely hormonal/physiologic and that I am being ridiculous with my complaints. He regularly asks me if I am menopausal or pre menopausal. I acknowledge that I take many medications following treatment for cancer a couple of years ago and do have a heat intolerance but the intolerance doesn\u2019t MAKE me hot nor do I ask for an unreasonable temperature correction. We are both overweight and actively working to lose weight. So I don\u2019t feel that that is as much of a factor as we both have that variable at play. I can only take so many clothes off but he doesn\u2019t feel he should be expected to wear additional clothing or use a blanket.  I am really struggling to not feel devalued in the choice to keep the house so hot. I will get so hot while cooking to the point that I need to open the windows and he gets very upset at that but at 79F the furnace runs constantly any way so the windows are only making me more comfortable in a hot space and not wasting energy/costing extra.  Am I being unreasonable/petty in my ask? AITA for opening the windows or am I justified in this frustration. For reference during the summer he will run the AC once the outside temp is hitting the 80\u2019s and will keep it at around 72-74F which is typically ok to warm for me but I can usually deal with that pretty well because at least it is cool air.  When he is away for at least several hours I turn the heat down as low as the settings allow or shut it off just for a break. This is the only time I adjust the thermostat. ",

The troopers came to my house (I\u2019m his emergency contact) to break the news. The first person I called was his father, and he flew out the next day with my exs sister. Before he flew out he asked me where we should have the service, in texas (where we live) or back in Maryland where our families and friends all still live.  I told him I felt like the service needed to be in Maryland because that was where everyone was and P (my exes father) agreed. He let me know the funeral home said they might be able to do a small viewing with just family and I agreed to doing that as long as I felt like he was in a condition he\u2019d be ok with.  I met my exes sister and his dad at the funeral home to go over paperwork and plan the viewing, he told me all the details for the funeral back home and we talked a bit about where my ex worked, his day to day life, his home, and the probate process. His father was taking care of the probate process and seemed defensive about some of his belongings, I really felt like focusing on my children was more important than arguing over small things in the home\u2026 all of that could wait so I backed off of helping with cleaning out him home and handed all of his insurance paperwork and other information I had that would be useful to them like contacts at his work and his electric login.  We had the viewing, both of our children said goodbye to their dad and it was very emotional. At the viewing I mentioned that a friend had paid for our tickets to fly home as I was quickly realizing how much everything was going to cost and I suddenly was without the financial help of their dad.. I was extremely thankful for their generosity.  After the viewing I didn\u2019t hear anything from his sister or dad, they didn\u2019t ask to see the kids or let me know what was going on with the process and I was actively trying to navigate the life insurance process while grieving my ex and helping my children with their feelings. The last few days have been a blur of crying and anger for all of us, we are so heartbroken to have lost him.  My exes sister and father flew out on Friday and around noon I got a call from his father telling me we were not welcome at the funeral and that my children and I would be a distraction to his (my exes father) families grieving.  I\u2019m shocked and hurt, I told him I had never heard anything so hateful and the conversation was over.  My exes father and sister have never visited texas, we\u2019ve lived here for 4 years. They were not close and had no idea where he worked, or even any recent photos of him. We were divorced but still good friends, and my ex was a devoted father. His children were his world.  AITA for not listening to his father and still taking them? The funeral is open to anyone, I can\u2019t imagine us being there among hundreds of other people will really be a problem.  Edit: for those asking his reason, he said \u201cwell I gave you a nice service here\u201d -we had a short viewing only and had previously agreed to the service being in Maryland so no, there was no service.  Also for clarity I am the beneficiary on the policies, my ex and I did his open enrollment together every year and we put each other as our beneficiaries to make it easier if anything like this ever did happen  I have a wrongful death attorney and he is helping me with the process but I will reach out to a probate attorney.

Me (17F) and my closest friend(17F) have always kind of assumed we would go together in a group unless we had dates(or at least that's what I thought). About 3 months ago me and my current day boyfriend(16M) got together. We love eachother and want to go to prom together. When I told my friend a few days ago he wanted to take me she acted like she was fine with it. Even texted me the next day saying she had made plans with another one of her friends. The day after that is when things went down. We were in class and she starts bringing up ideas of us going on a double date or going in a group together, but I tell her my boyfriend and I want it to be just him and I (I mean would anybody really want other people there when it's meant to be a date). Then after a few minutes she tells me that she is mad. She says she feels like I'm ditching her for him. She then states it's unfair bc it's our junior prom and his sophomore prom and that he should have known better. Is it just me, or is prom more of a couples dance than a friend one? I know she has had to work to be able to go to a dance more than others because she struggles with academics and this is the first dance she is able to attend this year. But I knew she had other people to go with (people who she literally told me she made plans with after she found out I was going with my bf). Idk, AITA for wanting to go with my boyfriend instead of my best friend? Edit: I would also like to mention that me and my boyfriend had been friends 7 months before we actually got together, so it's not like there was no history with him and I was ditching my friend for some guy I've only known 3 months.",

It's helped declutter the counters a bit, although most of the large pots and pans are still left dirty on the stove and countertops for days at a time. The problem with the dishes bin is that once the mess is out of sight, it's out of mind.  Most of the time, people clean their dishes within two weeks. Occasionally something will go bad or they can't fit anymore dishes there and it's a reminder for them to clean up. However, on to the issue at hand, one of my housemates has had dishes sitting in their bin for almost a month.  The most notable object is a large mason jar with coffee in it that has dried significantly and produced a large amount of mold. Their dishes are also spilling out on top of the counter, as they have no more room in their bin. I don't like having something so unhealthy growing in our food space, and their extra dishes are taking up space others use for cooking. Normally, I would be fine with asking them to clean up. However, about three weeks ago, they told our house about a loss they experienced. I don't want to go into details for their privacy, but it had put a strain on them and they asked for some grace on their dishes.  Everyone agreed and consoled them, and I did as well. However, it's been three weeks now and the bioterror is still growing.  Other info: - I'm a working student, so I barely have time for my own life and dishes, so doing their dishes for them is out of the question. - We don't have a dishwasher. Our house is 100 years old and there literally isn't space.- While we do have meetings for our house on a regular basis, I would likely bring this up with them privately, in person.

I go to bed when he wakes up for work, I go to work as he's getting off, and I get home about an hour after he goes to sleep. We have lived in the same apartment for almost a year, and have known each other since we were 11. Our apartment is set up to where our rooms are across from each other and the living room/kitchen are connected. He likes to sleep in the living room in a recliner for some ungodly reason.  Normally I just get fast food bc its so late but I got tired of spending $8-12 a day to eat. I've started cooking, small things though, such as a couple eggs and some meat to make a sandwich. My A few days ago before i started i called him and said Hey you should probably sleep in your bed because im gonna start cooking and i don't wanna wake you up. He responded with It's fine if you wake me up I'll just go to sleep. I knew that's not was was gonna happen and I said that, but he dismissed it.  Well, guess what? Last night I cooked. Granted it was midnight, but it was my first time eating for the day, I wasn't hungry earlier, and I wasnt gonna go drive my car to go get fast food. Its wasting my time and money, and I already spent the money on groceries. Then he came in about an hour ago and was like Okay, cooking when im sleeping is fine but can we NOT do midnight?, and I said I told you to sleep in your room dude He goes My names on the place I can sleep where I want. SO I said then you're gonna get woken up dude you can sleep in your room that's what its for. Then i kinda just wanted him to leave before I got legitimately upset so I just started being homo-erotic and he thinks its weird so he shuffles off.  My entire view is you could literally just sleep in the room and avoid being woken up, plus its not like im banging pots and pans on purpose im being as quiet as I can. Am I the Asshole?  ",

        "selftext": "To give some back story I am about 14 weeks pregnant, my shower is planning for May 31st. my SIL and MIL asked me about a month ago to ask to plan my baby shower and I told them both that they could work together on this. I just found out I\u2019m having a girl about last week and was waiting to give them the go on planning the shower, I wanted to know the gender first then pick a theme then. I ended up picking Winnie the Pooh for the theme. My SIL and MIL are both control freaks, they both need to be in control of every situation and especially in party planning. I am not that way, I am the type of person that would be happy to do whatever is needed. They just had a lunch regarding baby shower talk, I thought this is a collaborating meeting and they would be delegating who would be doing what and paying for what. Mind you, my SIL is not contributing much but her time. My mil is contributing time and money. When the meeting was done, my SIL called me after the lunch and stated that my MIL was mad and completely changed when my SIL told her that everything was handled. Me and my MIL were under the impression that this was going to be a collaborative meeting, I didn\u2019t know my SIL had basically figured out everything already. My MIL was taken back by this understandably but my MIL is also very detailed orientated and wants things her done her way. My MIL states she has no say in the shower now and does not want to be apart of this anymore. I later asked my SIL to let her have some of the duties and my SIL basically said everything is done and there is nothing to do. My MIL called my husband and stated \u201cif you don\u2019t want me in this child\u2019s life just tell me\u201d over a disagreement over a baby shower and a discussion that I was not even involved in. I hate drama and I would rather not have the drama go on and cancel the baby shower entirely. Am I the asshole to cancel it entirely so they both cannot continue their antics?

        "selftext": "Last year, my fianc\u00e9 and I signed a lease for a townhome while planning our wedding, and I decided to get a roommate to help with expenses since we are living separately to save for the wedding. The place is furnished by us, but I left one room downstairs empty. My fianc\u00e9 stayed with me briefly approx. 3 weeks due to family issues, she only needed a place to sleep, and I made sure to talk to him about it, and he was fine with it.  Things got uncomfortable when my roommate got back with his girlfriend, who began spending more time at the house. It started with occasional visits, but soon, she was here so often it felt like she practically lived with us. I\u2019d come home to find her asleep on the couch, eating food from the fridge, she has her own place. This wasn\u2019t a huge problem at first, but it became more frequent, and she\u2019d sometimes be in the house when no one else was. Then my roommate had a friend stay for a week, leaving a mess. Although they cleaned it up eventually, it was annoying and uncomfortable. I decided to talk to my roommate about it, expressing that it was the frequency of his girlfriend being over that bothered me, and how it was affecting the shared living spaces. He was visibly annoyed and didn\u2019t talk to me much after that. Things didn\u2019t improve, and over time, I felt like I couldn\u2019t relax in the common areas because it seemed like they were irritated when I was around. I started staying in my room to avoid the tension. I didn\u2019t want to make things worse by bringing it up again, so I vented to my fianc\u00e9. She suggested I speak to him again, but I didn\u2019t want to keep pushing the issue. Eventually, I got the flu and decided to stay at my mom\u2019s house because I couldn\u2019t relax at home with his girlfriend there. My fianc\u00e9, not knowing where I was, drove over to check on me. I explained why I wasn\u2019t at the townhome, and she asked if I\u2019d talked to my roommate about my concerns. I admitted I hadn\u2019t. My fianc\u00e9 offered to talk to him since she\u2019s better at communicating, but when she did, he got annoyed, saying he could have his girlfriend over as much as he wanted since he paid bills & she is not someone he should have this conversation with only with me. Later, when I spoke to him, he said that if I could have my fianc\u00e9  living there, he should be allowed to have his girlfriend & any guest as much as he wants (my fianc\u00e9 only stayed 3 weeks, she has been here for 3 months). I tried explaining it wasn\u2019t about her staying over, but how frequently she was there. He accused me of double standards, which wasn\u2019t my intention. I don\u2019t want to micromanage him, but it bothers me when she\u2019s here alone or when he brings random people over. I even suggested that if he and his girlfriend want to live together, they could find their own place, but he just walked away, and nothing was resolved.",

        "selftext": "This past weekend, I (22F) was set to have my gf (22F) over to visit. I am still living at my parent\u2019s house while I am in the process of applying to vet school while I work at the local vet. My parents had approved having my long-distance gf (we\u2019ve been together for three years, recently long-distance since I just moved) over for the weekend to visit. She got in a little after 9:30 pm this past Friday. We had dinner, chatted, and went to bed. The next morning, I had a shift at the vet from 8:30-1 so I left early. In the meantime my gf (let\u2019s call her E) hung around and chatted with my parents about the new house and how they were settling in. They ate breakfast together and had a good time.  E had mentioned that she planned to go to Costco and would be gone about 45 mins. My parents were ok with this and let her know how to use our mechanized deadbolt. She left to get me lunch and met up with a mutual friend, who we\u2019ll call L. I had asked my mother about a week ago if L could stop by and get a tour of the house. She agreed. E comes back to the house with L fully expecting me to be back home from work. I was not. I had to stay two hours late because of several emergency cases. I could not answer my phone at this time and it was around 16F outside. E brought L in to use the bathroom and play with my dog for around a half hour. Then she left and went home.  Near the end of my shift I get a text from my mom telling me to call her ASAP. I clocked out and gave her a call. She and my father began yelling at me. They saw L come in on the Ring doorbell and were furious that E \u201clied to them\u201d when they asked her what her plans were that day. When they had asked her this, she was in the middle of texting L and deciding what they were doing. I had told E it was alright that L came in because my mom had ok\u2019d it. I fully thought that I would be home to show her around. She accused E of \u201clying by omission\u201d and not telling her that she would be bringing a \u201cstranger\u201d (she and I have known L for over a year) into the house.  My dad then chimed in and said that we better be gone by the time they get home because he \u201cdidn\u2019t want to see E because he didn\u2019t know what he would say to her.\u201d (My gf heard \u201cdidn\u2019t know what he would \u2018do\u2019 so we\u2019re not really sure). This screaming and berating went on for about a half hour. They constantly blamed E when she did nothing wrong. We packed up and left. E left a handwritten note to express how sorry she was, and that she never meant to \u201clie\u201d to them.  It was all just a big misunderstanding. My mom, who usually constantly checks on me to see how I am and sends me sweet little texts is completely giving me the silent treatment. We\u2019re set to come back today but I just don\u2019t know what to do/say. I never meant to go against their wishes and I would never blatantly disrespect them like that. I apologized and told them to blame me and not my gf, but they\u2019re not budging. ",

So he hints around that he wants to go out, and after some back and forth he asks if I want to go to the bar. (Honestly at first it seemed like he didn't want me to go, and I was okay with staying home.). Anyway, I agree and we head out.  It's not far away and I even commented that I could be designated driver. For some reason that seemed to make him uncomfortable, but he brushed it off and off we went.  So I order my one drink, he gets his beer and some quarters and we play some pool.   Somewhere around the second game, an older guy at the bar starts critiquing my game, telling me which ball to shoot for, etc.  By the time we're into the third game and he's making his helpful suggestions, I stop and ask him (verbatim) excuse me, if you were playing, would you like someone to tell you how to play?. He took a second, said no, but you're bad at it.  I said I know, and took my shot.  Pretty tame?  At least I thought so.  Husband asks what I said to the guy so I told him... And he was upset!  Said I shouldn't have been rude.  We finished that game, I lost again and he wanted to leave.  He said I was rude, the guy was drunk and I should have ignored him.  That we were there to spend time with each other not get into a bar fight.  I said I was sticking up for myself and I think it's despicable that he'd be mad at me for that.  That I don't need him to stand up for me, and nobody was having a bar fight...

The internship ended and I ended up moving back to my city, so we couldnt really hangout but we did keep in touch. I ended up getting an offer for a full time job in his city, so when I started working there I told him and he immediately asked to hang out. This time I had no excuse so we made plans to hang out the following week. 2 days before, he cancels and tells me hes sick and can we move our hangout to the next week. I agreed and following up to that date, we kept chatting and I asked him how his job hunt is going.  He was struggling to get a job, so I told him he should reach out to the company we interned at the summer to see if they have any openings because they had also offered me a role, which I ended up accepting with a start date of next year, just so I can have it as a back up if I ever get laid off.  Right after that message he stops replying to me. 3 weeks go by and I dont hear anything, so I'm thinking maybe something bad happened, but I see him constantly posting on social media. So i reach out to him to see if everythings alright since I havent heard from him in a while. Again no reply. Im thinking he got offended by me mentioning I had two offers while hes struggling to get one. I can see why that would offend him, but that wasnt my intention, AITA here?",

        "selftext": "Alright, this started a while ago when myself (17f), and my friend, Eli (17m) decided to partner up for a school project. I've known Eli for around 4 years and we've been friends for the better part of that time. We decided to pair up because we were in the same class and he is a very sweet person.  Well, as you can probably guess, it didn't go off great. This project included two essays, plus another paper with two paragraphs and a data table (this was for a science class), and a slideshow. For our first essay, I ended up writing all except the conclusion, but he apologized and said he was busy with his extracurriculars (he is in theater and a few clubs, so he's more busy than me). I wrote the two paragraphs and made the data table, which again, he apologized for doing little.  Finally, when it came down to the second essay and slideshow, we agreed to split it 50/50. I finished my part a couple days before it was due, and every time I asked, Eli said he was working on it. However, the night before it was due Eli told me he needed me to do his part and he'd only wrote half a paragraph. I freaked because of the deadline and (somehow) finished his part in one night. We turned it in last week, and tbh I was pissed. When it came to our presentation he didn't even remember much about our project, which upset me more.  When I tried to express my thoughts, Eli accused me of overreacting and not being understanding and that he's been very busy. I get that life happens and he does more clubs than me, but with we had three weeks to do the final part. Am I really overreacting? Thanks.",

        "selftext": "For context, I have a close friend whom I\u2019ve known since middle school whose mental and physical health have suffered a lot in the past two years, and I really do feel for her but sometimes our relationship has been much more difficult lately than it used to be because she now needs a lot more attention than I can give, and there\u2019s been tension between us on and off for a while. Right now she is extra unhappy with me. My husband and I suffered a miscarriage this month and right now there is a condolence gift from her waiting for me at the post office since Tuesday (it\u2019s Sunday) because no one was home to sign for it, and I have not had the energy (or the burning desire, to be honest) to go pick it up.  This is probably made worse by the fact that she is someone who wants to hang out all the time, and I haven\u2019t wanted to see anybody or do anything in about 3 weeks. She sent a card too which was very sweet, and I thanked her for that and thanked her for sending me a gift, but I let her know that I didn\u2019t have a chance to pick it up yet and was not sure exactly when I would. I will pick it up. I will! But I want to give myself a minute. Because: 1. I don\u2019t like stuff. It doesn\u2019t actually matter what it is. My love language is not gifts. When I buy something and bring it into our house, I choose it really carefully and think about it for a long time. I can pretend well enough to be gracious and give people the response they want from me when I receive a gift, but my true feelings are that I hate receiving gifts because they almost always become a chore, one more thing to add to the pile of things to find a new home for without just chucking them and adding to the landfills. I hate things, I can never punt enough things out of my home fast enough, and I hate this about our culture. 2. Trips to the post office are my least favorite kind of errand. Our post office doesn\u2019t have a parking lot, there are always lines, etc. I avoid having to go there even when I\u2019m not depressed and dealing with something, so the truth is I\u2019m a little annoyed that she set me up for an obligatory post office trip. Though I know better than to ket her know that.  She doesn\u2019t understand and is upset that I didn\u2019t make haste to cut through my grief and depression to go pick up this gift (which yes, as an aside, has a very good chance of being something I will not want, and which I\u2019ll need to drum up energy to find a new home for at some point.) Am I cranky, depressive, isolating? Yes. But am I allowed? AITA?",

        "selftext": "AITA for not summarizing TV shows for my husband? [Update in comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/qm07zWV2xg) Ongoing argument between my husband and me. I'll be watching a show, and he'll come in partway through and watch a few minutes. He might watch bits and pieces as he comes and goes. Since he knows a little about what's happening, when he comes back he'll ask, So what happened with the suspect? Why did they break up? It's not always a one sentence answer, and it takes me out of watching the show to have to summarize what happened. And I know it sounds silly, but if I'm watching a show to relax, I don't want to have to sit and think about how to explain what happened.  Our most recent argument was when I was watching Will Trent and he had asked me 3-4 questions already that I answered. Finally he asked me another, and I told him, exasperated, to just look online. (Something I've started saying to him when I don't want to answer.) He argued that it would just take a few seconds to answer the question. I told him any reasonable person would agree with me, so here we are. Btw, this is not a serious fight. I am exasperated with him, but neither of us are seriously upset and we love each other very much. Even if I do want to throw a pillow at him when he does stuff like this.  So what says reddit? Edited to give my husband's perspective: I was in the middle of watching the episode, and fell asleep. When I woke up, the episode was over. I asked my wife how it ended and she refused to tell me.",

        "selftext": "So just a brief intro, I was living away from home for uni up until recently, and my brothers (29 + 23) are still living there, having never moved out for a whole host of reasons which I won't get into here but will be happy to elaborate on if anyone is interested. It basically boils down to substance abuse issues and then getting the easy life at home, being provided for by my 60 year old mother. She buys all their food, amongst other things, that's important to keep in mind. I recently moved back to my mum's in order to save money while I save to move country to do my masters degree. It has been quite unbearable, to be honest, trying to adjust to the lack of independence. Anyway lol, I have a pretty specific diet, namely Whole Foods, Plant Based - I don't eat added/processed sugar, dairy/meat/animal products etc. Because of this, I buy ALL my own food and don't touch the stuff my mum buys for them bc they eat a pretty Standard American Diet, which is of no interest to me.  The issue is, for the last few months since I moved back, my food is constantly being eaten. Despite the fact that I have taken to writing my name on my food with black sharpie as they were (potentially feigning) ignorance originally. Just this week for example, a good lot of my veg has been eaten, they somehow went through a full loaf of wholegrain bread overnight, my hummus was half eaten, my falafel, pickles, no-added sugar baked beans, my homemade veg burgers amongst others were all eaten. Bizarrely, my vegan cheese was eaten when they have actual dairy cheese available to them IN THE SAME FRIDGE. I have said to them multiple times, but they get very defensive and say it's only a few quid or it's only frozen veg, what like 40p? I have said to my mum as well twice now, tho I don't want to go on at her bc it's not her problem and she's already stressed enough, and her response is pretty much the same, even saying what do you expect of course they'll eat what's in the fridge. There is no acknowledgement on my brothers' parts of the fact that it's not really about the money (tho that's certainly part of it), but about the principal of respect and boundaries. I feel like I'm genuinely going insane. Should I stop going on about it? I do feel like an AH for bringing it up all the time, but then i also feel strongly that their behaviour should change and not my reaction to it. Idk, what do yous think? ",

I then go back home and go back to sleep until 11:45am-12:00pm to get ready for my job, which goes from 2:00pm to around 10:45pm. Jenny gets a ride home from work with a coworker, and gets home at either 5:45pm-ish or 8:00pm-ish, depending on whether her and her coworker went to the gym. She starts getting ready to go to bed by 8:45 every week night, and she is asleep by the time I get home around 11:00pm. We have a bathroom in our bedroom with a corner shower, where we both shower at different times, and since it's right next to the wall against the bed, you can hear everything that goes on in there. I also have a computer about 5 feet away from the end of the bed that has a clacky keyboard and fans that can admittedly get pretty noisy. Jenny has an anxiety-based insomniac condition that makes it really hard for her to stay asleep when there are a ton of noises around the room through the early hours of the morning. I try to go to bed at around 3:00am since I'm a night owl, but climbing into our creaky full-size bed wakes them up every single time, even with three different sources of white noise, i.e. the fan, an app on her phone, and an ASMR video on the tv with the screen off and a sleep-timer. She's been getting more and more irritated as of recently, A few days ago, she had a very stressful and emotionally hard day at work, due to her exhaustion that has accumulated over the weeks. She's trying to find a therapist or make a doctor's appointment to get on some good sleep meds, anything that's stronger than over-the-counter meds, but it's hard for her to find time on top of her job all day and trying to go to the gym three times a week. I'm very remorseful about the amount of stress that I've caused her, but it's my bedroom, too, and I have things I need to get done in our room after work that I otherwise wouldn't have time for.

But every time I call her, he\u2019s in the background, which makes me believe my mom isn\u2019t having him move out like we had talked about .My dad lives 5 minutes away from her and I could easily stay with him, but mom would be able to help out more with the kid. So am I the asshole for maintaining my boundary of keeping toxicity out of our lives? ",

But today I woke up and my foot was in pain (might be a trapped nerve not too sure) so I said maybe I can go out idk yet I'll see how it feels later. Couple hours pass I try walking but it's painful and I'm limping pretty slowly. So I said no I don't think I can go out then I start getting attacked because I won't go out. Then she starts listing out all the things I did wrong like how I should be walking on and that putting my foot up for the day wasn't right.

        "selftext": "back story: my partner has always hated celebrating their birthday due to past disappointment. they also have extremely high expectations on what their birthday should look like. for example, they always say they want grand extravagant plans but they never give an example of what that includes.  ok so present day: they plan an activity they are passionate about and i say ok ill plan around that. my plan was going to a restaurant they have on their list of restaurants to try, then another activity they been wanting to do for a long time then time away with each other. the next day would be something with their friends and family as well as a decompressing massage they\u2019ve been asking for. we had plans to go to a full spa day next weekend.(mind you i ran all of this past their family member and mine as well and both said omg this is very thoughtful and nice. so i thought i was in the clear). we are at dinner and they ask what\u2019s next and i said it\u2019s an activity you\u2019ve been wanting to do. so they try guessing and they get it wrong. however it is getting late and i said if you\u2019re getting sleepy we can always do the next activity at a later date. they go to the bathroom as we are wrapping up dinner then comes back saying how they don\u2019t want to be disappointed by the rest of the nights plans so let\u2019s just wrap it up and go watch a movie. i\u2019m confused bc everything was going well and now they\u2019re over it. oh and the worst part (or what i thought) was them saying they\u2019ll never be happy.  we go back to our hotel and they get even angrier bc it\u2019s not decorated (mind you, i had a decorator and they cancelled and i didn\u2019t have enough time to decorate myself or cancel the reservation. they fall asleep and wake up at 1am ready to talk. we went back and forth and ultimately they said it\u2019s time for a break, put their rings on the nightstand, and say \u201cthat\u2019s that on that.\u201d so given those words and actions, i took that as they no longer want to be around me and the relationship is over. we\u2019ve gone on breaks before but never have either of us given back our rings. so i truly thought it was the end but now they are mad that i didn\u2019t fight for the relationship. so with all that said\u2026 am i the asshole for reacting the way i did when they gave back their rings and said we are on a break?",

        "selftext": "Okay so I (29M) started college when I was 17. Because of my family\u2019s income and general status I was not granted much financial aid for college. Because I have 2 younger siblings, and my parents had other financial responsibilities, my parents could not afford to pay out-of-pocket for my undergrad and I was not granted nearly enough in personal loans. The school my parents and I agreed on is a private university, and tuition was high.  Because of the cost of the college, personal loans were taken out in my name, and my parents took out Parent Plus Loans in their name. Now I work full-time and my loans are on an income-driven repayment plan. I am easily able to manage my monthly payments on those (the ones in my name). However, my issue is that my parents are demanding monthly payments for the ParentPlus Loans taken out in their names. Their stance is that the loans were taken out for me and my education, so I am responsible for repaying them. The ParentPlus Loans cannot be transferred to me, and the payments are literally half of my income each month, because the lowest payment option is based on THEIR income, which is significantly higher than mine.  I have been paying them monthly for a year, and this has forced me to live paycheck to paycheck, unable to save for a car or house. I can\u2019t start a family, and I can\u2019t progress financially in any way due to immediately having to spend every dollar I earn on those payments plus rent/bills/insurance/groceries/therapy/etc\u2026 The ParentPlus Loans are currently in forbearance (since October) until April. This past week I told my parents I will not be resuming payments on them due to 1) Its not my loan. 2) We (Americans) are about to get hit with a recession/depression. 3) I cannot advance in any way making these payments. My mother has responded saying that\u2019s not an option because their retirement and/or credit will be ruined by this choice, and that I will owe them the money. AITA for wanting to stop these payments?  TLDR; My parents took out a loan for me to go to college, but the loan was in their name. They now expect me to pay them back for it, but I can\u2019t afford it. AITA for discontinuing payments so I can afford to live somewhat comfortably?  Edit 1 (More Info): There was no clear communication about repayment discussed when the loans were taken out. My mom took control of financial planning of my college, and I was very passive in the process, unaware any loans were taken out in their name until payments started being due. If they were my personal loans, they would be payed based on my current income. Edit 2 (More Info): My parents didn\u2019t force me to go to a specific school, but also I wasn\u2019t really provided choices. When I graduated high school, the discussion was basically \u201cSo you\u2019re going here, right? Because that\u2019s the best option.\u201d and there wasn\u2019t more debate or discussion on it. I liked the school. My parents liked the school. I didn\u2019t really take ownership of that decision or fight it because my mom took charge of college stuff for me.  Edit 3 (More Info): My parents knew what types of loans were being taken out. They both work in banking/finance, and know how money/loans work. And again, my mom took full accountability/ownership for the financial planning of my college.  Edit 4 (Wording): I have no stopped the payments yet. Adjusted wording to reflect that I want to stop making them. The loans are currently in forbearance. There was no sudden stop of payments to my parents. Edit 5 (Idek): People seem to think I\u2019m set on my opinion. I\u2019m here to listen, learn, and grow. I\u2019m not trying to screw over my parents, and I\u2019m not accusing my parents of being malicious. I\u2019m trying to come up with solutions that my parents and I can use as a team to combat this. And I want to hear all perspectives on the situation. Attacking me by saying I hate my parents or vice versa is simply not true, and not helpful. Edit 6: Because people are still attacking me for being \u201cselfish\u201d or \u201chating my parents\u201d I need to be VERY clear that I am here, again, to listen and learn. You are able to communicate your perspectives respectfully. I don\u2019t hate my parents, nor do they hate me. I\u2019m not set on any plan other than working as a team with my parents to combat this. No one is cutting anyone off unless this escalates wildly and unexpectedly. Yall need to chill on the personal attacks. I can be in the wrong about something without being villainized. If I\u2019m in the wrong, just point it out and explain why. No need to attack me beyond that. Final Edit: Leaning ESH on my own post. Thanks to everyone who has been kind and given me insight, advice, support, and reassurance. My mom and I are working towards coming up with a plan so neither me nor my parents will be screwed over by this. People who kindly and respectfully disagreed with me, you are appreciated. This issue is no longer Me vs My Parents. It\u2019s now Me & My Parents vs The Problem. Thanks all except those menaces who for some reason think I should hate my parents or vice versa. \u2665\ufe0f\ud83d\udd7a\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udd25 ",

My mom cooks certain things that make me sick and nauseous. Most of the times when I tell her I can't eat it she makes me eat it anyway and I end up throwing up later. I'm on a medication for my disorders. My meds will often make me lose my appetite or make my stomach hurt. The thing is that I don't come close to being a picky eater. For lunch my mom made some type of meatloaf with green beans and cheese. Just looking at it made me gag. Instead of understanding I just genuinely cannot eat that, she practically forcefed me and I've thrown up at least three times in the past two hours...I just ran away just a few hours ago. I still feel guilty asf. My mom didn't let me get therapy and controls me. Idk if I'm the asshole for not wanting to be around her and just run away.",

        "selftext": "For context, I (F26) have a girlfriend (F25) and we\u2019ve been together for about 7 years. We met in college and bonded over toaster strudels and our love for vampire diaries. (My girlfriend is Mexican by the way) She has already met my parents and they absolutely love her. But every time we go to my families thanksgiving\u2019s, my aunt and grandma always joke about my girlfriends heritage, for example, in 2023, when she went to grab some beans to go with her food, my aunt said \u201cof course she wants beans\u201d and my grandma and uncle laughed. It wasn\u2019t funny at all. Last years thanksgiving (2024), me and my girlfriend went to my parents house, as they were hosting, and everything was good. That was until my aunt and uncle came, and straight away they were talking about how Mexicans never say thank you, and that they should go back to where they came from. I became angry, practically livid, and began to shout at them, revealing all my aunts secrets, about how her marriage is practically hanging on a thread, how her child is depressed because of her, and how an alcohol addiction wouldn\u2019t change any of that. Me and my girlfriend left after that. Now half of my family  are telling me that I\u2019m in the wrong, and the other half are saying that I did the right thing. My parents are saying that whilst she was in the wrong, I shouldn\u2019t have brought all of that up. So AITA?Edit: I probably didn\u2019t bring up a lot of context in my last post, but I will try my best to add some now. I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder since I was 13 years old and have a tendency to get angry easily. It has gotten better over the years, but still little stuff can get to me. My aunt, uncle and grandma have been making little remarks at my girlfriend for years. When I first introduced her to them, my grandma pulled me aside and told me to keep an eye on my girlfriend, saying that \u201cshe might steal\u201d from my house. My girlfriend has dealt with racism most of her life, and explained that she isn\u2019t comfortable with it. She also has anxiety, which makes her extremely uncomfortable with altercations, which is why she hasn\u2019t said anything to them about their racist comments. She even asked me if we could go to her family\u2019s thanksgivings instead of mine because of the blatant racism that my aunt and grandma constantly bring up.",

I had been with my girlfriend(now fianc\u00e9e at the time of their divorce). Well I pretty much moved in with her and was staying at her house during the week and going home on the weekends. It eventually changed to never really going back home unless I needed to speak to my dad about something. He\u2019s been a heavy drinker for most of my life which he still is at this point. Me and my fianc\u00e9e have a baby on the way and we\u2019ve been looking for a place to live and we found one. The only bad thing about the whole situation is that my dad is looking as well and he\u2019s been bugging me about co-signing on a loan with him to get a house but he keeps telling me that he\u2019s going to pay it off with the money from house when it sells. But he\u2019s been saying that we could all move in together and I just don\u2019t think it would be a good idea with the baby and I also don\u2019t feel comfortable doing it and I explained to him because of mine and fianc\u00e9es situation. But anyways, yesterday me and her went to my dads house(that\u2019s currently being sold) to pack some stuff up and he was leaving to go take a walk and he said to me that \u201cI killed him for not co-signing with him\u201d. I\u2019m feeling really guilty about it and it\u2019s been tugging at my heart. I just want to know\u2026 Am I the asshole and in the wrong for not helping him? Or should I have helped and jeopardized me and my fianc\u00e9e\u2019s future?  -EDIT-Okay so I apologize to everyone that has replied about not providing enough information I was typing this out on my phone and didn\u2019t want a massive paragraph for everyone to read. So I\u2019m going to answer some of the questions that I was seeing in the comments. Me(M26) and my fianc\u00e9e (F27) have been together since 2018 and have a baby on the way that will be born in May. We are going through the buying process of a home currently. My father and mother are getting half of the money that the house is being sold for after the remaining balance of the house is paid but the only reason he wants me to co-sign on the loan is because his credit isn\u2019t the best. He got a DUI a couple years ago so he doesn\u2019t car so he basically relies on me to take him places which I don\u2019t mind taking if I have time and it\u2019s places like the grocery store, appointments, etc. but I feel like he\u2019s been getting pretty comfortable with it cause he doesn\u2019t ask me anymore just basically demands that I do it now.

I work M-F at a Montessori school. I take my 2yo year old with me to work. So we don\u2019t have to get a babysitter. So I watch him 24/7 Sat I usually drive to my grandmas she cooks dinner we do laundry and take showers . I like to drive back to our house Sun, so we can sleep in our own beds, not air mattresses sun night, and then I don\u2019t have to drive an hour and 15 mins to work Mon. Our house is 3 mins frm the school I\u2019d rather not be preggers sitting in a car for over an hour after a crappy night of sleep with a potentially crabby 2 yo  jumping into work My husband bartends so weekends are big he will work till about midnight. For WEEKS we have had the argument that he wants us to sleep over 1 more night, and do the drive Mon instead of Sun. I have caved and done that before, here is how it goes he gets off between 10-12. Drives the hr, our son is asleep when he gets there.  I get preg insomnia especially sleeping uncomfortably there. So I\u2019m awake but he goes straight to bed. Our son wakes up 1-2 times at night which he doesn\u2019t hear so I do those wake ups (they don\u2019t really happen at our house) in the morning we eat and I try to wrangle the 2yo into the car on time &not  be late for work. Hubs gets to shower then he drive separately back My argument\u2026.. why do I need to be there? If he wants to come shower he is more than welcome to. But I would like to be able to go home Sun and it feels pointless for me stay Sun if it makes my life more difficult but seems like he would be doing the exact same thing whether I was here or not. He has a good relationships with my fam they would have no problem him being at my grandmas without me. He says I\u2019m being selfish and not thinking or him/caring about his needs. I just genuinely completely don\u2019t understand.  It hurts me to stay that Sun, and it doesn\u2019t seem like he needs me here, wants me here? I\u2019m sure he\u2019s a little more comfortable with me here. But the logistics for him doesn\u2019t change.  AITA?",

I (34f) broke up with my Ex Boyfriend (40m) last June, so a little over 7 months ago. There wasnt any big blowout reason, the relationship just didn't work out for me. I put in all the effort while he always provided the bare minimum and at some point I just didn't feel like taking care of a grown ass man anymore. It was really hard on him and he kept texting me for a while. I replied politely but also told him he needs to move on. It was just too little too late. I know I may sound coldhearted but I had my reasons to break up with him and I didn't really want to stay in constant contact or keep being friends. So yesterday I was out with my siblings and he randomly calls me. I have a tendency to people pleasing so my sister took my phone, rejected the call and texted him that I was unavailable due to being out with them.He texted back asking me to call him when I was available because something bad happened.  So I finally grew a spine and told him I couldn't provide him emotional support and to please understand. He then texted me that his mother had passed away and he just needed someone to talk to and how could I be so cold towards him.This is where I might be the asshole because I still did not want to call him and be his emotional support. I just want to stay out of this and as sad as I am for him I don't want to be involved in this. So am I the Asshole?",

For his birthday, I bought him a childhood game he had mentioned he never got to play but still felt nostalgic about. I thought it would be a thoughtful gift to fulfill his childhood dream, and I added some expensive snacks. He seemed joyful at first, but the next day, he shamed me for it, comparing my gift unfavorably to an even more expensive gift from his best friend. He called my gift childish and useless, gave it to his nephew, and said he couldn't eat the snacks, so he gave them to his brothers. I felt very upset and explained my intentions, but I didn't want to let him control my mood, so I brushed it off and tried to forget about it. After this incident, I became discouraged from buying him anything. One day, I noticed that the calluses on his hands were getting worse, so I bought him weightlifting gloves. As soon as he saw them, he commented on how ugly they were and insisted I should return them. I was just trying to be thoughtful, and I never expected such a reaction. I felt so disappointed, but again, I brushed it off and stopped gifting him anything. For context, he only gave me a gift once, and that was on my birthday. I'm not trying to shame him, but I wish he would consider my thoughtfulness when I buy him things. Even if he didn't like them, he could at least pretend and not put me down. Now, with Valentine's Day approaching, I feel so discouraged from buying him anything. ",

        "selftext": "My husband and I (both in our 40s) have a pretty decent split of household chores and maintenance type items. One of my chores is cleaning the bathrooms. I am also quite handy around the house and don't mind rolling up my sleeves to get dirty, so I also snake any drains when they get clogged up. (Sinks, showers, etc.) This is a skill that I have taught myself out of necessity. It's not something we specifically discussed as being my chore/obligation, but I took it on to be helpful and do my part because we are a team.  That said...He is a man and shaves his face. He does this over his bathroom sink, of course, and makes minimal effort to prevent his trimmings and shaving products from going down the drain even though I have asked him to do better many times. Predictably, his sink needs to be snaked every few months because he has clogged it up yet again. I have taken care of this every time so far, albeit begrudgingly. Anyone who has performed this task will understand just how putrid and vile it can be in there. I am getting tired of cleaning up an easily preventable mess and am refusing to snake his sink this time. I told him he should take care of it, but it remains unaddresed several weeks later. Mind you, he doesn't know how to do it and I have offered to teach him. I am attempting the teach our kid this as well, because it is a life skill.  Also relevant: we have been in our home for like 14 years and I have never had to snake my bathroom sink and have had to snake our shower exactly one time (I do my best to collect my hair and throw it away to prevent it from clogging the drain). I feel like he is a grown ass man who is capable of cleaning up after himself and him refusing to do so is not something I should be punished for.  I also acknowledge that since I have been doing this task that there is a reasonable expectation for me to continue doing it, but this is above and beyond occasional clogs from normal use.  Sooo... AITA? ",

        "selftext": "Hi All, My dad calls me often when he\u2019s been drinking or high. When I see his number, I know what it ultimately is for - money. Context, I grew up in a large family and my dad was rarely in my life. He and my mom were constantly fighting; he would beat her and we would need to move to get away from him. He always found his way back to us. He wasn\u2019t a great father figure. He didn\u2019t provide for us and neither could my mom. So, we grew up poor.  I never really liked him. I thought of him as a terrible father and human being, but as he\u2019s gotten older, he\u2019s softer and I am at the age where I get to see his personality. Maybe it\u2019s because he\u2019s in his 60s and I\u2019m in my 40s that we can have the relationship we have. You see, I don\u2019t have the energy to argue with him, and he\u2019s too old to be petty (like he used to be). So, our conversations are about life and what to look out for as you get older. He tries to go down memory lane, but I hate it because he\u2019s only able to talk about the years when I was in grade school (ages 0 - 10). He\u2019s picked up on it and doesn\u2019t bring up the past as much. Anyway, I\u2019m an engineer and I make a great living. My wife is a professional in health care and she earns a great living, too. Together we make $46k per month. I would say we\u2019re a middle class family with a middle class lifestyle. Why is this important? Because when my dad calls, he always asks for money. The money isn\u2019t a lot. It is usually $100 dollars. He calls every other day. Now I hate giving him money because 1) it feels like he use me as an ATM 2) he takes the money to go buy drugs and alcohol and 3) I have a feeling the asks are going to get larger. He\u2019s always talking about moving in my home (he says it\u2019s a joke, but I know it\u2019s not).  One day while we were on the phone he said, \u201cSend me $100 since I know you have it\u201d, and I said \u201cI\u2019m not going to send you any more money\u201d. He then tells me \u201cI know you\u2019re going to send it because you always do\u201d. Now, he\u2019s right because even though I say I\u2019m not, I\u2019ll still cash app him the money. I\u2019m upset with his presumption about what I\u2019ll do. This has irritated me so much so that I\u2019ve stop answering his calls the last few days. When I went over our expenses for the year (this is only because we\u2019re preparing our taxes), I noticed that I\u2019ve given him close to $20k for the year. Again, it doesn\u2019t harm our finances, but $20k is a lot of money.  AITA for cutting him off and no longer taking his calls and sending him money? ",

        "selftext": "Im quite bad at story telling so kindly ask for clarification if needed. My family is Asian. For context my sibling 37M is married (2nd time) and we usually don't get along well together. Now he wanted to come back and stay with parents for the time being cause his wife needs to rest at her parent's home(its nearby).I vehemently refused his presence cause we need to share a bathroom. He works from home so he locks his room , won't open the room to allow me to use the bathroom. Other bathrooms are there in house but my parents are old and frequently need to use it. While he stays at home he doesn't help out in household chores, throws a fit if someone tries to use the room/clean the room even. Meanwhile I am the one the parents call whenever they have inconveniences , need to pay online bills, take them to hospital and clean up after them. Surprisingly before his wife got pregnant he apparently wasnt able to move in with parents with wife cause he needed to go to office once a week. Suddenly he is able move back in ? Also I must apparently use the bathroom during normal hours cause needing to poop at 6.30 am in morning is not a normal hours. Hence my refusal to let him move back in. AITA for refusing to put up with him and compromising?  Edit: Cannot move out for atleast next month or so cause I spent last 3 years getting a degree. Awaiting the documents and for other paperwork. Till then I cannot legally work anywhere. 2. Parents have incontinence issues hence need for their own bathroom and privacy. 3. My income over the years has been  less than him since I am younger by almost 8 years. Hence I have just started my earnings whereas he has been working for long and is now earning more along with perks provided by company. My field does not provide me with that sort of salary even at highest position and perks will not be given at any point in life.  Edit 2: Parents also offered to rent out another place nearby which is 1 min away from our house. Either i would move there or they can. He refused. In-laws also welcomed him to stay with them and he does not want to go there as well. ",

        "selftext": "Hey Reddit  I (24f) bought some pants a couple of months back from an online thrifting website. The pants are unique and I payed a reasonable amount for them. I asked for the measurements and they should fit my size. I was super excited to receive them. I\u2019ve struggled my whole life finding pants that fit my body type and this time yet again they didn\u2019t fit around my hips.  My friend (25f) is smaller than me. I\u2019ve given her pants and other clothes before I couldn\u2019t fit. Not that long ago I gave her some unique pants again found thrifting online and they fit her perfectly. She got to buy them for a cheap price. She loved them and wore them often and it honestly hurt to see the pants I was so excited to fit me actually fit her.  So this time around I got some pants that of course yet again are too small. Instead of showing them to my friend first, because she\u2019s a smaller fit, I decided to put them on sale online instead.  I showed her my profile on the online thrifting website and she saw the pants and she now insists on trying them on.  I\u2019m well aware that I\u2019m playing into my insecurities and my jealousy when telling her that I\u2019d rather sell them online for a stranger to wear them instead of her, because it hurts too much to see her wear the pants I got excited would fit me. I have explained this to her and she\u2019s thinks I\u2019m being very unreasonable.  So, am I the asshole for not letting my friend try the pants I recently bought - instead I want to sell them online? Am I playing too much into my insecurities - should I let her try the pants and let her buy them if they fit?  Edit: Update!First of all, selling clothes online came up as a conversation topic and I brought up that I just started selling online. She then wanted to see my profile and spotted the pants. I did not smear the pants in her face just for me to tell her she can\u2019t have them. In hindsight, maybe I should\u2019ve just not told her I started selling online but I swear to god it wasn\u2019t some kind of evil plan to make her envious of my pants and jerk her around. Second of all, I am not jealous that she is smaller than me. I\u2019m jealous she can fit the pants I put my time and effort into finding. Good thrift finds are hard to come by. Third of all, she was not mad at me for not letting her try them on. She just didn\u2019t understand my reasoning. To all of you saying I need serious help; I am actively seeking help for my insecurities and have been through therapy before. After almost 15 years of friendship, me and my friend are very close - almost a sister status. We read all your replies and it opened up a healthy and interesting conversation between the both of us which only made our friendship stronger.  Thanks to all of you. You helped me realise that it\u2019s okay for me to have insecurities and that my feelings are valid, but I see now and I agree with a lot of you that it\u2019s border-lining pettiness and I will try my best work against that sooooo: I let her try the pants on (!!) and oh well she didn\u2019t even fit them lol, but a good conversation came out of it and from now on I won\u2019t hide them from my friend but I will definitely demand the same price I\u2019m selling them for online.",

        "selftext": "I (f26) and my fianc\u00e9 (m30) are getting married later this year and we've recently began sending out the invitations. We've said from the beginning that we're only inviting partners of family members if we know them and that we're not going to be inviting partners that we don't know or are in fairly new relationships. We hand delivered invitations to my fianc\u00e9's family and invited some partners (that we know and get along with well and have essentially been a part of the family as they've been around for a while), but other partners that we do not know have not been invited. I will note however that we haven't invited my mils partner as he's awful to my mil and we just do not like him for many reasons. Today we went to visit my fianc\u00e9's grandparents and before we were able to properly greet them his grandmother began yelling at us that were horrible for not inviting his cousins partners (who we do not know and they've not been together for more than a couple of months) and that we're selfish for not wanting to pay extra money to invite them all and that family should come first regardless of how long they've been family for  We told her that we have invited all immediate family but not the people we don't really know and I told her it wasn't her place to decide who should and should not get an invitation to our wedding. She then began yelling at me claiming that we were treating my family better than my fianc\u00e9's and that I'd probably invited more people from my family than his (not true there are immediate members of my family who we are not inviting), she then called me an awful dil to my mil as mils partner isn't invited, as I said previously he's abusive to mil and just makes me incredibly uncomfortable.  So are we the arseholes for not inviting everyone's partners to our wedding? Edit: long term partners, fianc\u00e9's ect are invited it's just short term partners that we do not know with the exception of one that aren't invited.  This is the case for both sides of the family not just my fianc\u00e9's, as I've already seen a few comments implying that I am treating my fianc\u00e9's family different to my own, we are not and after the wedding it's one family and I'm already treating it as such. We have a budget that can accommodate 70 people, we've invited immediate family and some very close friends, we've been prioritising those who we really want to share our day with, and not put ourselves into severe debt. I don't want to not invite some family and close friends to accommodate plus ones we have never met. Edit: I realised I've only used the term plus one however every single invited has incorporated names only so everyone is a named guest and we've not give. Any plus ones plus ones I'm not sure if that will change anything however.",

        "selftext": "I (27F) hit one year sober (from alcohol) at the beginning of the year. This was a huge accomplishment for me. It was bigger to me than finishing college. I told my family that next time we were together for family dinner I had something to celebrate. This all happened at my mom\u2019s. The kids were playing and the adults were hanging out. I took the moment to share that I\u2019d reached 1 year sober and how good I felt about it.\u00a0 They went with \u201cOhh, that\u2019s what you were talking about\u201d and \u201cHas it been a year already?\u201d I am embarrassed to admit I hoped someone would say they\u2019re proud of me. My BIL Steve looked at my sister and they both said \u201cWell\u2026\u201d at the same time and she said \u201cSince we\u2019re all here, (Niece) just got into (a specific gymnastics thing). It\u2019s been a LONG road but she did it!\u201d Steve popped some wine they'd brought and started giving everyone glasses/cups. He made eye contact with me and his face fell. I had this gnawing feeling so got up from the table. I took a walk. I tried to get through the moment mentally so I could be present for my niece to celebrate her success. But when I got back to the house my sister asked me why I left without saying anything. I said I needed a minute to myself. She looked at me funny and said \u201cOkayyyy\u2026\u201d I said I\u2019d shared something I was very proud of and she bulldozed over it. My mom put her hand up and asked me what my news was. I said that I\u2019d told them. I hit one year sober. Mom said my generation always wanted praise for doing the bare minimum, that wasn\u2019t an accomplishment it was just what I needed to do, like graduating high school. I tried to make it through to dinner but found myself just not in the mood anymore. I decided to go home.\u00a0 **Here is the direct thing I am being called a butthead for:** Id brought a small berry chantilly cake (my favorite) to share after dinner. It was the thing I decided I earned. The kids had definitely seen it. On my way out I decided to take it home with me.\u00a0 I guess when they realized the cake wasn\u2019t in the garage fridge anymore, my sister called to ask me why I took it. I said I did because it was MY cake to celebrate MY accomplishment. She said, word for word \u201cAre you fucking serious? Oh my god Emma, GROW UP. You are such a fucking baby.\u201d My Mom later texted me directly to tell me how disappointed she was that I threw a tantrum because my niece got more attention than me. I don\u2019t think her read of what happened is right, but that is why I am asking you guys. Am I the asshole because I took home the cake in the end? Was that really childish of me, considering the kids saw it and then didn\u2019t get any? As I was putting on my shoes to leave, Steve found me and directly apologized and said that he was completely oblivious in the moment. I know he did not do anything to intentionally hurt me. **EDIT FOLLOW UP:** Hi everyone, I just wanted to follow up and say thank you to everyone for the responses. I have a lot to think about when I next go to therapy (today, actually) and work on. I do want to clear up a few things that I've seen come up a lot on the comments: I am not in AA. I'd tried AA before and it was not compatible for me. It works for a lot of people very well and I'm happy for you if it works for you. So, stuff about the steps and personal inventory are not relevant to me. It wasn't a party for my niece, it was just a family dinner. The cake *was mine* and wasn't brought *for* my niece. I didn't take it *because* I wanted to get back at them. I took it because it's my favorite cake and I wanted to eat it because it was my thing that I earned.   I don't know why they opened wine for my niece getting into the gymnastic program. But I also don't think it's my place to say anyone else has a drinking problem, and I'd prefer to have eyes on my own paper. :)",

        "selftext": "I made a blanket for my sister in law Amanda. I was able to give it to her last weekend. She\u2019d asked for it in certain colors. I didn\u2019t have any other projects on my to do list so I was happy to make it for her. I had most of the colors already too so it worked out. When I gave it to her she was excited and she started to look it over, I figured it was to see how it was put together, since she doesn\u2019t crochet. After a little bit she said that she loved the blanket, BUT she couldn\u2019t help but notice some of the little mistakes I\u2019d made along the way. I asked her what she meant, and she pointed out some things like I\u2019d accidentally done one row of striping instead of three for one section, I\u2019d switched to the wrong color and threw off a \u201cpattern\u201d at some point, etc.  She handed it back to me and told me that she loves my progress with it and couldn\u2019t wait to see the finished project. I told her that it was finished. She looked down at it and said that it wasn\u2019t done until it was perfect, and I\u2019d made several mistakes that I could easily go back to correct. I was honestly dumbfounded by this. I hate the way perfectionists try to force their quirk onto others. I made this blanket for her for free out of my own free time because I love her. I told her that. She said she knows and she loves me for it but that she wouldn\u2019t be able to use it because she wouldn\u2019t be able to focus on anything but the mistakes. I said whatever and took the blanket back and said that if she doesn\u2019t want it, I\u2019ll keep it. She looked surprised and said that she does want it, she just wants my best work and not something half assed. I told her that if she thinks me crocheting A WHOLE FUCKING BLANKET and making minimal errors is half assing it, I\u2019d rather just keep the blanket. She\u2019s so upset with me and told me I was acting ridiculous and that it wouldn\u2019t take me long to fix it. If you know anything about crochet you know that if I made an error on row 36 of a 1115 row blanket\u2026 that\u2019s essentially starting over again. Anyway I come to you all lol AITA? ",

        "selftext": "(It\u2019s NOT a dollhouse, but I didn\u2019t want anyone to think I was being misleading on purpose by saying I built a house) I (28M) made my wife (28f) a replica of a house that\u2019s known to fans of a musician, but wouldn\u2019t mean much to others. It\u2019s about 2 feet tall and wasn\u2019t very complicated to build, but my wife had said a few times over last year that she thought it would be cool to have for little trinkets. She\u2019s like a crow with her trinkets, I love it. She didn\u2019t know I was making it for her, but I did sneakily involve her in its creation through having her make a couple Tiktoks when we were out together so I could get the colors right. She has no idea, lol.\u00a0 I was excited, so I showed a picture to my brother. He told me it was cool, but didn\u2019t get the purpose. He showed it to my niece Ava (13f) who knew what it was and said she wanted one too. My brother asked if I would give it to Ava for her birthday. I said no, it\u2019s for my wife, but I could make one with Ava. It would help teach her some basic woodworking skills which they don\u2019t do in schools here anymore. I\u2019d like that. Brother said if it was so easy then I could make a second one for my wife and just give this one to Ava since her bday is the end of the month. Again I said no, this was done specifically for my wife. He seemed to accept that but then came back to me and said \u201cIsn\u2019t it a little weird to make a dollhouse for an adult woman?\u201d I told him it\u2019s not a dollhouse, just a fancy shelf. He argued that makes it worse, because Ava would actually \u201cplay\u201d with it. He must have gone to complain to mom about it (he is the younger brother) because mom called me to tell me that it was \u201cstupid\u201d to give my wife a dollhouse. I tried to explain that it\u2019s not a dollhouse but she just kept saying \u201cthat\u2019s stupid.\u201d\u00a0 This weekend I was at their house and Ava kept bringing up the house and laying it on thick with statements like \u201cI\u2019ve alway wanted one just like it.\u201d She kept asking why my wife wanted a dollhouse. I said it\u2019s not a dollhouse, but she kept asking why she needed a dollhouse. I told my brother that he was encouraging his kid to be manipulative and I really didn\u2019t like it, so I was going to leave. He told me that I was dangling the house over her head like McDonald\u2019s and teasing her and that it made me a bad uncle. Being a good uncle is important to me and I do feel for the girl because she\u2019s a big fan too. I admit I have a blind spot for this because I don\u2019t have kids and maybe I shouldn\u2019t have shared the picture with my brother to begin with. Am I really the asshole for not just giving it to her? Yes, it WAS easy to make and I COULD make another quickly. **Sorry guys Ava isn't my brother's biological daughter, there's a long story involved that I didn't want to add but I should've realized the age would be surprising.** I still see her as my niece regardless but I get why that would be alarming.

        "selftext": "My (33F) daughter \u201cCleo\u201d (5yo) hates pink. She has disliked the color and almost everything to do with it since she was about three or so. She has one pink shirt she likes and one pink stuffed animal, and that\u2019s it. My father\u2019s partner, \u201cPrue,\u201d refuses to accept that Cleo doesn\u2019t like pink. Over the years, she\u2019s made several attempts to push the color onto her (pretty much every gift she\u2019s ever given her was some shade of pink), no matter how many times I tell her to stop. She has tried to give me dozens of different reasons why I should encourage my daughter to \u201ctry different shades.\u201d It clearly upsets Cleo, but Prue keeps doing it. About a week ago, my father invited me, my husband and our children for dinner at his place. He said he and Prue had a surprise for the kids. Right before we left home, my younger sister (who still lives with our father) texted me. She warned me that the \u201csurprise\u201d was actually a small birthday party Prue had planned for Cleo. That alone threw me off, because my daughter\u2019s birthday was in November. My father did miss her actual birthday party due to work, but still. Also, my son turns 9 in March, so I had figured his would be the next party we\u2019d have. Then she sent me photos of how the place was decorated, and it very clearly wasn\u2019t actually meant for Cleo. Literally every piece of decor was pink. The table, the tableware, the balloons, everything. She had gotten pink banners and glued pink foil fringe curtains on the doors. Even the cake was pink. I showed everything to my husband, and we agreed not to take the kids there. I texted my father the following: \u201cHey, (sister) told me everything. We\u2019re not coming. We\u2019re taking the kids to McDonalds and telling them that was your surprise. You and Prue can come if you want, we\u2019re paying.\u201d We did exactly that. My father did show up (without Prue), but he was cold with us and left 20 minutes after arriving. Both him and Prue are pissed. My father is angry that my husband and I dismissed his partner\u2019s \u201cheartfelt gesture\u201d towards our daughter. Prue also told me that I\u2019m the reason Cleo is \u201crestrictive\u201d (I also don\u2019t like pink), and I\u2019m raising her to be an ungrateful, spoiled brat who is unwilling to compromise. To be honest, I get how I could be in the wrong here. But at the same time, this just felt like Prue trying to push something Cleo doesn\u2019t like onto her yet again. My sister and one of my brothers are on my side (though my sister did say I had been rude). My other brother is on the fence. AITA? EDIT: My daughter doesn't know I dislike pink, nor would I care if she did like it. EDIT: I have written an update, as well as a separate post to sum up the comments I left here.",

        "selftext": "Let's jump into this: I (29F) gave birth to my 3rd baby in November.  The women in my husband's family (his 2 sisters, our sil, and his mom) and I have a group chat whereas we send pictures of our kids, tell funny stories about our day, and, in this case, send updates about possible labor.  On this particular day in November, at 37 weeks plus 5 days gestation, I reached out to inform that this just might be the day my newest baby decides to make his grand entrance. I had been having strong contractions since 5:50 that morning.  Everyone, except sil (my husband's brother's wife) responded with excitement and praying hands emoji's.  Well, according to the nurses at the hospital, I wasn't dilated enough to be admitted, despite strong and frequent contractions.This was at noon. I updated the chat. Everyone seemed concerned and asked if I still thought if it might still be that day.  I assured it was most likely going to happen that day, judging from past experiences, but I would go home to labor in comfort. This is where i might be the a-hole.  My sil, who also gave birth to her 3rd baby a couple months prior (via c-section. I am not judging nor think of her as less than, just context is key) decided to text how glad she was that I wasn't in real labor and that it's better that I wait to have the baby another couple of weeks. She then sent a bunch of screen shots and links to articles about false labor and Braxton hicks. AS IF I HAD NEVER GIVEN BIRTH BEFORE OR EXPERIENCED PREGNANCY BEFORE. I replied, mid contraction:  Not to be bity, but this ain't my first rodeo, and I know how to Google things as well.  And yes, I have been checked, and they will check again before deciding IF I should go home or not. Well, I did go home, only to go back to the hospital a couple of hours later and had my baby at 10:15 that night.  Sil does not reply to me in texts, and has since unfriended me on Facebook. (Not that I really care about that.)  I just want to know it I was an a-hole for what I said... and, in hindsight, perhaps I shouldn't have been texting in the groupchat while in labor.  So, reddit. Was I an a-hole? Edit: I meant to elaborate on the c-section detail. Which definitely makes me come across as someone who looks down on her for it. Which I do not.  Her first baby was a preemie and she had an emergency c-section. Her youngest 2 were scheduled. The point I was trying to make was that our experiences with pregnancy and childbirth are completely different.  Which, I could have said without the c-section fact. My apologies.  Edit: a little more info about my sil and my relationship. She thinks she's the matriarch of the family, even if she won't admit it. We recently moved out of state (only 2 hours away, long drive, but not as long as they treat it), a few months before I gave birth, and she started cutting us out of family get together and even created a whole new group chat without my husband and me. She is always shocked at how intelligent my husband is because he went to community college instead of a university, like she did. I didn't go to college. I saw no point in going into debt, I didn't know what I would go to college for, so I decided to wait. So she often treats me like I am unintelligent.  I think the snappy text was probably long incoming. But it was poorly timed and shouldn't have been in a group chat.It was not the first time I had gone off on her in a group chat either. She singled me out a few months prior, questioning my ability to care for my kids by myself while my husband was away for a couple of days.  Yes, in the big family group chat.So I snapped back. My husband saw the message before me and said I'll let you handle her. As he held me back many times beforehand to keep peace. Like I said, it was possibly poorly timed but long incoming. ",

Seeing this I wanted to give Mj a life that she deserved, not what our mother gave me, even though I was only 19, i filed a petition to get custody of her, it was a long hard process but when Mj was 2 i finally got full custody, all this to say, im legally Mj\u2019s dad. Im the only dad she knows and she calls me dad. A year ago I met my girlfriend, Ida (24f) and we started dating not long after, I really thought I found somebody to like me and Mj, Ida would always take Mj on \u2018girls days\u2019 and  little \u2018dates\u2019. I proposed to Ida on Sunday, it seemed like everything was great until a few hours ago. Ida was at my apartment having dinner with me and Mj, well when i was cooking dinner I heard Mj say something along the lines of \u2018Your gonna marry my daddy and your gonna be best friend\u2019 I thought it was cute until I heard Ida laugh and say \u2018He\u2019s not your dad Mj\u2019 which caught me off guard, i guess she thought i couldn\u2019t hear her because there\u2019s one a wall between the kitchen, but still i don\u2019t know why Ida said that. Mj was confused as 5 year olds are said I was and Ida kept correcting her until Mj started crying, Which honestly made me mad, I asked Ida why she would even say that and Ida stated \u2018She was going to find out eventually\u2019 and I was an arse for not telling Mj in the first place. I got mad and one thing led to another i said somethings i shouldn\u2019t have, telling her she had no right and Ida went home and Me and Mj had dinner alone, Ida started blowing up my phone later saying what I did was \u2018wrong\u2019 and basically was just ranting to me through text, I started doubting myself and now i\u2019m here.

We\u2019d had good times one-on-one, and when he invited me to events with his friends, I\u2019d contribute to the group dynamic by never showing up empty handed and offering to grab drinks for others. Fast forward to a holiday-themed party with his friends. My date and I planned to meet there and hang out afterward. I spent the day cleaning my condo and preparing mulled wine to bring. During the party, people were getting drinks for one another, including me when I served the wine. At one point, I was sitting on the couch, blocked in by only my date on one said and many others on my other side. I was tired and didn\u2019t feel like tightly squeezing past people I didn\u2019t know, so I asked my date if he could grab me a glass of water. He shook his head and after I said \u201chuh\u201d he said, \u201cNo. I was just up, and you could\u2019ve asked before I sat down again.\u201d I was taken aback because I view small gestures, like grabbing water, as basic acts of care for friends, but especially for someone you\u2019re dating. That moment, combined with a long day of preparation, left me feeling drained. Since the party was winding down and I didn\u2019t have the energy to engage further, I said my goodbyes and called a ride. My date offered to walk me out and said he felt hurt that I was leaving. I explained I needed to recharge but that he was welcome to come over after the party. As we walked out, I jokingly mentioned how him not getting me water surprised me. He replied, \u201cWow, that really upset you, huh? I have to be guarded about these things, you know.\u201d Later, we texted, but he seemed more upset about me leaving than interested in listening to why I felt drained. When I tried to call, he didn\u2019t answer. His texts were curt, and I eventually told him I\u2019d let him decompress. Two days later, I called to discuss what happened. He said he\u2019d call that evening but didn\u2019t reach out until three days later, saying, \u201cI\u2019m not dodging you, I\u2019ve just been busy.\u201d At that point, I was over it, especially since he never acknowledged the misunderstanding or my attempts to resolve it. A month later, we finally had a conversation. He explained that getting me water felt \u201csubservient\u201d and was something I had to earn through time and \u201cbeing in the trenches with him.\u201d He also said I didn\u2019t understand how busy his life was (for context, I work multiple jobs). I calmly explained that grabbing water for someone isn\u2019t about being subservient but a small act of kindness. After reflecting, I feel his responses and handling of the situation were disrespectful and indicative of bigger issues. So, is there an asshole here? I appreciate the perspective.",

We live in Germany where I work in an English-speaking environment, so to get extra practice in, I told him that after x date, we'd switch to German, which he is fluent in (grew up here). We've managed two days so far, where even if he accidentally says something in English I answer in German, but last night he told me he needed a break from me speaking German. I refused, and said it's only for 10 weeks until my exam, then I'll go back to English. He says I don't sound like his wife when I speak German. I asked if it was because my mistakes were jarring or my vocab was causing issues. He said it just 'didn't feel like he was speaking to his wife'. I think it's vital that I stick to my plan, to get my speaking practice in. He seemed a bit sad after I said no.WIBTAH if I carry on auf Deutsch?  UPDATE: Thanks to most of you for very well-thought out and reasonable comments. I tried to read as many as possible and appreciate the different viewpoints. My husband came home this evening, we ate dinner, and I apologised (in English) for not being very understanding. I showed him the post... some of the comments made us laugh so much. We discussed and found a healthy compromise that works for both of us to help me prep but not exhaust him after a long day! I've also taken on your suggestions of other places I can try and hone my German conversation skills and will try some of them out. ",

I\u2019m talking $50 here for gas, $100 there during a trip, even once $300 when he needed to buy an \u2018emergency\u2019 PS5. I never really kept track because I trusted him. He paid me back some of it over time, but he still owes me a decent chunk, which I\u2019ve never bugged him about. He would occasionally \u2018gift\u2019 me skins in the games we play in an attempt to balance the books. A few weeks ago, Jake covered my $60 when I left my wallet at home during a group dinner. I told him I\u2019d get him back, but life got busy, and I totally forgot. A few days ago, he texted me, \u201ccan you send me that $60 from dinner?\u201d I apologized for forgetting and said I\u2019d send it that night to which he replied, \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have to chase you for this, man.\u201d That rubbed me the wrong way. I didn\u2019t say anything in the moment, but it really started to bug me. I thought about all the times I\u2019ve lent him money and how I never pressured him to pay me back. I\u2019ve never once sent him a passive-aggressive text or made him feel bad about it. So, I didn\u2019t send him the money right away and instead told him, \u201cLook I get that I owe you $60, and I\u2019ll pay you back but let\u2019s not pretend this is some one-sided thing. You still owe me hundreds, and I\u2019ve never hounded you about it.\u201d Jake didn\u2019t take that well. He said it\u2019s not the same thing because I never asked for my money back, so it\u2019s on me if I didn\u2019t care enough to get it. So now he\u2019s pissed at me thinking I did not pay him back intentionally and saying I\u2019m deflecting to avoid paying him back, and that I\u2019m being a stupid friend. I feel like I\u2019m in a weird spot here. Yeah I owe him $60, and ofcourse I\u2019ll pay it back. But on the other hand, his reaction feels so hypocritical given everything I\u2019ve done for him financially over the years. AITA? Edit: I paid him back like I always intended to do.",

        "selftext": "My son (11M) and I (44M) recently booked a trip to go skiing in Colorado. It was my son's first time skiing, but he had seen a lot of skiing videos on YouTube, and he seemed really excited for the trip. We also live in Florida, so this is not the trip you can just go and do whenever you like (we are not rich). I grew up in Utah and I loved skiing when I was younger, and I would say I'm an expert on the mountain. The first day goes all good, and my son really enjoyed skiing for the first time, even though he fell a lot, lol. I made sure to be as supportive and caring as possible, even when he was struggling, because I wanted to make this as fun an experience as possible for him. However, on the second day of skiing, he says he's finally ready to ski down the whole mountain, and so we take the lift to the top. Luckily, there was a way to get down the mountain while only staying on green level trails, so we took that way.  My son is having a blast, when all of a sudden, this guy in his 20s careens into my son from behind going on insane speeds, wiping them both out. My son immediately started crying and came running to me after he got his skis off, and once he calmed down, he ran to the lodge where my wife was, and she decided to take him to the doctor's office. I immediately confront the guy for being so reckless, and he simply says that I should have been paying better attention to my kid, and then he rode off. That was the final straw for me, and I called the ski patrol number in the app and told the guy the situation and what the skier was wearing, and they told me they would find him and kick him out. Later on, I saw him getting escorted out of the park by two ski patrol officers, and when he saw me, he immediately started cursing me out and calling me a horrible dad. I tried to ignore it, but now I'm second guessing myself if I overreacted. So, AITA?",

Every New Year\u2019s Eve, my family has a big party at my aunt and uncle\u2019s house and every year, without fail, I end up being the DD. Don\u2019t get me wrong I love my family, but it\u2019s starting to bug me. It\u2019s been like this since I was 19, even before I was legally allowed to drink. I don\u2019t drink much\u2014maybe a glass of wine or a beer, but I don\u2019t get plastered. I\u2019m fine with driving people home if they need it, but for the past few years, everyone expects me to not drink so I can drive them back. Every year, it\u2019s the same: \u201cOh, can you drive? You\u2019re not drinking anyway!\u201d I always say yes because I don\u2019t want to let anyone down. Fast forward to this year\u2019s New Year\u2019s Eve. I told my family ahead of time I wasn\u2019t going to be the DD anymore. I just wanted to enjoy the night, have a couple of drinks, and not be responsible for getting everyone home. I even told my cousin who usually gets really sloshed that I wasn\u2019t driving this year, and she was fine with it. When I got to the party, it was the usual chaos. People were drinking, laughing, and having a good time. I was enjoying myself, but around 11, my cousin came over and asked if I was ready to drive everyone home. I reminded her I\u2019m not driving tonight, I\u2019m here to enjoy the party. She looked at me like I was crazy and said, \u201cCome on, you always drive! Don\u2019t be a bitch.\u201d Which like, wtf? I tried to explain calmly that I wasn\u2019t being a bitch, just that I wasn\u2019t going to be the chauffeur anymore. Then, my aunt overheard and pulled me aside. She lectured me, saying, \u201cWe all agreed last year you\u2019d be driving. You know how much we rely on you. Everyone else is too tipsy, and Ubering is so unsafe. Just drive this one time, for the family.\u201d I felt a ton of pressure but refused I told her I\u2019m not their chaufeur and wasn\u2019t going to do it again just because no one else could figure out their own ride. My aunt got upset, saying I was being selfish and that we\u2019re family. She said I\u2019m the only one who doesn\u2019t get \u2018too drunk,\u2019 so it makes sense for me to help out. I told her I had already had three beers, so I wasn\u2019t even legally supposed to drive myself. That\u2019s when I snapped. I told them it\u2019s not my job to be their DD every year just because I\u2019m the only one who doesn\u2019t get blackout drunk. They needed to figure out their own rides this time. Then I got up and left. I felt bad walking out, but I didn\u2019t want to be a doormat anymore. I spent the rest of New Year\u2019s Eve at home, watching Netflix and eating leftover pasta with my boyfriend. My family texted me, calling me dramatic, selfish, and saying I ruined the night. They said I was being \u201csuper sensitive\u201d and that everyone was \u201cdisapointed\u201d in me. Everyone's demanding an apology out of me even now. And by the way, I got home perfectly safe by Uber. But anyways, Reddit, AITA?",

This time however, he\u2019s really outdone himself. A few weeks ago, he told me he had a \u201cgroundbreaking\u201d idea that would \u201cchange humanity forever.\u201d Entertaining him, I asked what it was. His answer? He wants to invent a new color. Before we go any further it\u2019s important to note we are both college graduates. I graduated in Biochemistry last year and my boyfriend in Philosophy a few years before, which makes this all the wilder I guess. I tried to gently point out that colors exist as part of the visible spectrum of light, so unless he was about to discover some new wavelength, this might not be possible. But he waved me off, calling me \u201cclose-minded\u201d and saying he was \u201cenlightened in a way you\u2019ll never be\u201d At first, I just nodded and let him ramble about his \u201cvision.\u201d But then he told me he needed funding to start his \u201cresearch.\u201d Specifically, he wanted me to give him $4,000 so he could buy \u201csupplies,\u201d including \u201cadvanced art tools,\u201d a lab coat (because apparently, scientists wear them, so it would make him \u201cfeel smarter\u201d), and\u2014wait for it\u2014a trip to the desert because he thinks the \u201cpure sunlight\u201d there will inspire him. I told him absolutely not. I\u2019m saving for grad school, and even if I weren\u2019t, I\u2019m not dropping thousands of dollars on his\u2026 whatever this is. He got mad, saying I didn\u2019t believe in him or his \u201cpotential to revolutionize human perception.\u201d He even accused me of being jealous that he had a \u201cworld-changing idea\u201d and I didn\u2019t. It got really heated and he ended up saying a lot of things about using my card as he knew the details anyway. For reference he\u2019s been unemployed for a while now, whilst I\u2019ve got a regular job. I ended up saying some things I do regret, but a lot of it was retaliation. Now he\u2019s sulking and telling everyone I\u2019m \u201cunsupportive\u201d and \u201cafraid of innovation.\u201d His friends are backing him up, saying I should be encouraging his creativity instead of \u201ccrushing his dreams.\u201d AITA for refusing to fund his quest to invent a new color? EDIT: In terms of drugs we smoke weed occasionally but haven\u2019t in the past few weeks, I\u2019ve never seen him do any other drugs nor have I found any in the house. So I don\u2019t know if I can really blame this on a bad trip  SECOND EDIT: Thankyou guys for all the advice, I\u2019ve moved the majority of my money into my second bank account for now which I\u2019m pretty sure he doesn\u2019t have access to. In terms of his mental health I\u2019m not in the habit of sharing his personal history online but seeing all your comments I do agree that this might be a mental health issue and I\u2019m going to attempt to approach him with the idea of a consultation tomorrow, if anyone has any advice on that please let me know as I don\u2019t want it to come across as insulting, I know he was down after his job but the comments have got me more worried about more serious illnesses that he may have.

It took me a while to warm up to the group and to connect with people I actually had anything in common with. I had to wade through a lot of botox parties and boozy brunches to find things I was interested in. But I did, and I started coming to group events fairly often. I hang out most often with the women who like to read, do crafty things, bake, skywatch, etc. Among these women is one, I\u2019ll call her Andea, who has made several comments about how she\u2019s a total klepto. I think that she makes these comments to seem \u201ccool\u201d to the other people in the group. I reached out to some of the women I see regularly at these events and invited them over to my place to watch a TV show we\u2019d been talking about and do crafty stuff. They were excited and agreed to come. Unfortunately, Andrea found out (I assume someone asked if she was going) and reached out to me to ask if she was invited. I considered this for a bit and then told her no, as I only had so much room at home. She didn\u2019t believe me and asked me for the real reason, saying \u201cI thought we got along\u201d which yes, is true.\u00a0 I told her I\u2019m not comfortable inviting a kleptomaniac into my home. That I\u2019ve worked hard to have the things I have and it would be stupid for me to invite her knowing that she openly brags about it.\u00a0 She said \u2018Okay\u2019 very quietly. She then said \u201cYou\u2019re painting me out to be some horrible criminal when you don\u2019t even know anything about me.\u201d\u00a0 I said that her being proud to call herself a klepto was all I needed to know. She said that I was a high school mean girl and ableist. I am unsure what the foundation for that statement is. This unfortunately has spilled over to the group, which is frustrating. But what has me the most surprised is that there are so many people defending her and telling me that I\u2019m out of touch and take things too literally. Am I?",

I told him that she\u2019s his guest, and it\u2019s not my responsibility to provide spa products for her. My friend got mad and thinks I\u2019m rude and petty. AITA? UPDATE: I showed my friend where to buy the shampoo and conditioner, he said he\u2019s sorry for getting angry and ordered new bottles for everyone to use. Thanks for all the NTA comments!!",

        "selftext": " (As a disclaimer, I have nothing against colored hair or people who choose to color their hair. My hair was bright green as a teenager, LOL.) My daughter Alexis (not her real name) is 15. She has been dancing recreationally since she was 3 years old and has been doing competitive dance since she was 9 years old. She has nationals coming up, which is basically a very big and important dance comp where studios from surrounding states come to this big convention center in the city and compete. She is also obsessed with Paramore, thanks to my husband who has taken her to many of their live shows. She idolizes Hayley Williams and has wanted to dye her hair like Hayley\u2019s for a few years now. This year for her birthday, she wants to dye her whole head neon orange. I told her absolutely not because she\u2019s not allowed to hair any unnatural hair colors for nationals and other conventions/comps that are coming up. She is very well aware of this rule because it is the standard in the competitive dance world. I\u2019ve already paid all of the entry fees and cannot get a refund for this year. I told her that once nationals and all the mandatory conventions are over, she can color her hair however she wants. She did not like this answer and stomped off to her room. I figured I would just let her be and eventually she would come around. I was wrong. She went to a sleepover at her friend\u2019s house about a week ago and came back with the same bright orange hair I told her she could not have. I was cooking when she walked into the house and nearly dropped the knife I was using. I was extremely upset and asked her what she was thinking. She gave me some excuse which I can\u2019t remember, then rolled her eyes and said something along the lines of \u201cit\u2019s just hair dye, it\u2019ll come out before nationals\u201d. I was livid, and shouted at her (which I\u2019ll admit I\u2019m not proud of) and she ran off to her room in tears. She knows better, and I\u2019m completely dumbfounded as to why she thought it would be okay considering nationals is in two weeks. She\u2019s washed her hair at least 6 times in the last few days and the orange is still stuck. I bought color remover and let it sit on her hair for a good 2 hours, and nothing. I\u2019m so pissed because now I\u2019m going to have to take her to the salon and spend 300+ dollars to get this color removed when I\u2019m already over 400 dollars deep in the hole after the fees for the competition. My daughter is currently grounded, still upset with me and hasn\u2019t spoken more than a few words to me in days. She cried to my husband after I shouted at her and now he thinks I\u2019m being unreasonable and called me \u201cmomzilla\u201d. Am I being crazy about this??! She knew the rules and I even told her she could do the hair dye after we get this over with. If this color doesn\u2019t come out, she literally won\u2019t be able to compete and I\u2019ll have wasted over 400 dollars.  Edit: Looking at some of these comments, I just want to clarify that when I asked Alexis if she wanted to compete, she was very enthusiastic and told me yes. She has done nationals every year for a fee years now and has loved it every time she has done it. I am very clear with her that since it is optional, she has the choice whether or not she wants to still participate and I am not forcing her in any way to do it. I am upset because she told me she wanted to do it, I paid the fees and now we can\u2019t back out of it but also she will NOT be bale to compete if the orange doesn\u2019t come out. Update: Hello all, thank you for the insight. I was really thinking about it last night and realized shouting at her and grounding her was not an adult way of handling things. I apologized to her and when we sat down for breakfast this morning and had a heart to heart conversation, in which we discussed the options she currently has. I calmly explained to her why what she did upset me and why I reacted the way that I did. She apologized to me for going behind my back after I put a boundary in place. For those saying it\u2019s not a big deal and it\u2019s \u201cjust hair\u201d you\u2019re right. It is just hair. It\u2019s not the orange hair that actually upsets me. It\u2019s the fact that she did it after I told her to wait because of the money I spent so she could be able to compete. I also asked her if being on the competitive team/doing dance in general is still something she truly wants to do, as some of you suggested. She opened up to me and said that while she loves it, she\u2019s exhausted and mentally drained during comp season and after. Part of the reason why she did the orange hair was because she thought she could get out of this one thing. There is still a lot of ground to cover and other things that need figured out, but I told her she does not have to compete any more if she doesn\u2019t want to and can just take her regular classes. She is still going to do nationals, but everything after that is up to her. Also for those saying I am limiting her freedom of self expression and trying to control what she does with her body: just no. Not once have I ever tried to force my opinions or values onto her because it\u2019s what I think is morally correct. I am an avid supporter of her expressing herself however she wants\u2026whether it be through her style, her hair, the music she listens to, etc. I will support her through every stage in her life no matter what she aligns herself with. I\u2019m not against the orange hair; I\u2019m all for it, just not right at this very moment. In no way do I want to prohibit her creativity or self expression. I set boundaries for her with a compromise which I expected her to follow through with. From one mother to\u2014I\u2019m sure the many others that have seen this\u2014how can we expect our kids to grow up to be well rounded adults if we don\u2019t set boundaries for them and occasionally limitations? Alexis is ungrounded, but not out of trouble. Her and I are going to brainstorm a different, more fitting way for her to learn from this. She is going to pay for a wig with money she earned from babysitting her cousins. I texted her dance instructor to let her know what we are doing and so the approval of her wearing the wig to the comp is TBD until it arrives. If not, she will be responsible for finding out another way to cover up the orange. For those who suggested box dye\u2014putting box dye on my daughter\u2019s hair will be the absolute last resort. I understand that she needs a fitting punishment and having to live with a muddy hair color from putting it over the orange will probably fit the crime, but I do not want her to be miserable for an unnecessarily extended period of time after the dance thing is over and after the situation has been dwelled on enough. Alexis doesn\u2019t want to put box dye on her hair either, but she said that if she has no other choice, then she\u2019s okay with that. I told her that if we DO end up having to put box color over it, that she is going to have to live with it until it grows out enough to cut it off or she will have to pay her color correcting service.",

        "selftext": "Two years ago I saw an original watercolor piece that I liked and I contacted the artist and bought it. When the piece arrived I sought a frame for it, but I hadn\u2019t been able to find a frame for that size every time I went to the store. They were all too big or too small. So I just kept the piece in an envelope in my desk, I would sometimes look at it, remember I had to find a frame for it but would later forget again. Work, family and life leaves little time to devote to thinking about a frame for a painting and I don\u2019t have any framing businesses near me, so that wasn\u2019t either an option. Today my boyfriend is dusting and comes out of the office showing me the painting on a spare frame he had been using for something else. I ask him if that frame is 9x12. He tells me it\u2019s 8x10, that he had to cut a piece of the artwork to make it fit. When I look at it the piece went from a centralized composition to having the composition indented to the left side because he cut all whole inch on that side to save the artist\u2019s signature which was on the extreme opposite end (for reference, imagine I if you cut the Mona Lisa to the point where her head is no longer in the center). When he notices I\u2019m perplexed he nonchalantly tells me that the painting was in an envelope anyway, and it\u2019s better if it\u2019s out so we can see it. I get mad because this is not the first time he has taken something of mine and given it away, offer it to someone or just not ask and do whatever he wants with it. His mother does the same thing with his things at her house. In their family if you\u2019re not using something anyone can do with it as they please. I explained to him in my family you don\u2019t do anything with other people\u2019s stuff I have a tendency to ruminate on thoughts, so I try not to engage in negative emotions because then I just can\u2019t let go of them and I cycle and cycle through them and it makes my life miserable, and I have to devote a lot of energy to get me back to normal. Every time I looked at the framed painting I felt a new wave of sadness, anger and frustration ripple over me. So I took the frame down, took the painting out of it, ripped it into four pieces and threw it in the garbage. When my boyfriend saw it he was shocked and visibly hurt. I get that his intentions were good, but he ruined a piece of art that was not his to begin with. Now it\u2019s awkward at home because I\u2019m still fuming and he\u2019s sad. AITAH",

        "selftext": "Me and my partner both work from home. During the day I work out of a spare room and he works out of the living room, so during work hours these two spaces essentially work as two offices. I will refer to the room I work in as my office for simplicity sakes but it is not the exclusive use of that room and there is a second bathroom that can only be accessed through the spare room. I scare extremely easily. I usually keep the door open unless one of us is on a call, but very frequently my husband will walk into the room and scare me really badly. Like I'll *scream* and jump and for a few seconds I genuinely cannot control my reaction, like I feel like I almost white out for a second sometime it scares me so bad. I dont handle it very well, a good scare will leave me shaking for hours after. I know I'm very weak to being scared and that its an unreasonable reaction but I genuinely cannot control it. I have some trauma in my past that contributes, but I am working with a therapist. My partner takes a great deal of offence to my reactions, even though I try to explain I cant control them. Sometimes when he startles me like that I'll say something like Why did you do that? or why do you keep doing that? as a reaction and that hurts his feelings. I always apologize and try to assure him its not personal, its just what comes out of my mouth when I'm scared but I can tell it really bothers him. I've asked him to just pause and knock before he comes in but thats not really fair to make him stop and knock in his own house to enter a room that isnt exclusively for my use. The scares are bad enough that they can greatly impact my work day. I know this seems extreme, but a good scare makes me feel like my brain turns off for a while after until I get ahold of myself again. I suggested this morning, after a good scare, that maybe I should get a motion sensor door chime like they have at shops! I could install it in the hall just before my door and put the noise maker on my desk so that I'll hear the noise and know he's coming. My Partner thinks that thats over the top but I want to find a solution that will work. Would I be the asshole if I just bought a chime and set it up? edit: I'm reading everything as it comes in this is just a lot of messages thank you! edit2: sorry, I'm like, a little overwhelmed. A lot of people are saying he's doing it on purpose and I hadnt thought of that and I'm more than entertaining that idea. I'm gonna try my best to reply to comments, thank you Those curious about the Brad story it doesnt have an interesting conclusion but if enough people care I will post an FAQ over on ask reddit.",

        "selftext": "Last Thursday, my neighbors approached my wife regarding a Use of Yard waiver since they don\u2019t have the clearance to move excavators and bobcats to their backyard to build a pool. The waiver states they need 10ft of clearance (4ft would be into our yard based on my measurements) and they would repair the grass to its original state. I have an irrigation system and internet lines which run beneath the area which would be used. The neighbors were leaving for FL and asked for a 48 hour turnaround. I spoke to the pool company on Friday and the PM said they need 10-12ft and they need the waiver because there is a good chance the ground will be totally torn up. It was my wife\u2019s 30th birthday this weekend so this situation was not top of mind but my neighbor knocks on the door Saturday afternoon asking for a response. I kindly explain I am not comfortable signing the current waiver given the typos, lack of notarization, and ambiguities regarding repairs. He takes it personally and storms out of the house complaining about how much money he is going to lose. Today, the project manager from the pool company knocks on our door asking what they can do to resolve this. I told him I really don\u2019t want my yard torn up but at minimum a new waiver needs drafted and I would consider it. He then says we have an electrical easement which runs 1.5ft into our yard in the exact spot he wants to use and would just call for access. I check my plat design and deed to see there is NOT any easement running thru the area they need. He leaves and the situation is still up in the air. Edit: thanks everyone for your input. I had run this situation by many friends and colleagues and the answers were consistently \u201cno\u201d unless you can get outrageous stipulations and even so it is still a risk. At the end of the day, I don\u2019t want to be dealing with the pool contractor or neighbor to return my yard and irrigation to its original state.",

        "selftext": "My daughter, Rowan (11), recently hosted her very first sleepover. She invited her best friend, Amanda (almost 11), who lives just across the street and two houses down from us.  They did all the classic sleepover activities: pizza, popcorn, a movie, face masks, and nail polish. Everything was going perfectly\u2014until around 11 p.m. when Rowan came into our bedroom to let me know Amanda was homesick and wanted to go home. I went to check on Amanda, and while she assured me she was having fun, she really wanted her mom. Fair enough. I texted her mom, Susan, to let her know what was happening, and she said it was fine for Amanda to come home. So Amanda packed up her things, and I walked her to the porch. From there, I watched her walk the short distance to her house and go inside safely before heading back inside myself.  The next day, I ran into Susan while she was out walking in the neighborhood. I asked how Amanda was doing, and\u2026 well, Susan was furious. Apparently, Amanda had been upset about leaving early, but what really got Susan\u2019s blood boiling was that I didn\u2019t walk her to the door. She berated me for letting her child \u201cwalk home alone, at night, in the cold, with the potential of God-knows-what happening to her\u201d. For context, we live in a quiet cul-de-sac in a safe neighborhood. I stood on the porch the entire time and watched Amanda walk into her house before going inside. Amanda didn\u2019t seem scared or hesitant, and she never asked me to walk with her. To be honest, it didn\u2019t even occur to me that this would be an issue\u2014when I was a kid, I would walk all over by myself. Sure, I know times have changed, but I genuinely thought this was fine. Susan didn\u2019t see it that way. She\u2019s still furious and has been telling neighbors I put Amanda in danger. Despite my apologies to both her and Amanda, she\u2019s banned the girls from playing together. Now I\u2019m left wondering\u2014was I wrong not to walk Amanda to her front door? AITA? Thank you all for the support. Here\u2019s some additional context:That night, it was just Amanda staying over\u2014no other friends. I\u2019m married, and my husband was home. Susan is also married, but her husband travels often and happened to be out of town that night. She has another child, Matthew (5M). She told me that if I had let her know I wasn\u2019t planning to walk Amanda home, she would\u2019ve woken Matthew up and come to get her herself. One of the neighbors siding with Susan mentioned that I should have known how protective she is of her kids, especially since Amanda is typically a shy and fearful child. I\u2019ll admit, I did know this about Amanda, but my own kids are the total opposite, so it wasn\u2019t even on my radar to walk her all the way home. Maybe it should have been. If Amanda had asked me to walk her home I absolutely would have.  I can understand (to an extent) Susan being upset if she truly felt I put her child in a \u201cdangerous situation\u201d. I thought this would blow over after a couple of days, but this happened at the beginning of December. ",

        "selftext": "Hey yall. Throwaway so imma try to be quick with here.  I am 27 F and married my best friend 28 M about a month ago. One of my good friends is a wedding planner and I used her company for the coordinating. She was a guest at the wedding but had 3 other people from her company work with my husband and I. They were amazing. The whole wedding went perfectly. Not a single complaint about the job the company did. One of the assistants was this guy who looked to be about my age. I didn\u2019t give it much thought.  This past weekend, I hung out with my friend Clara (25 F). This is the first time we are seeing eachother since my wedding. Clara told me a \u201cfunny story\u201d about my wedding. She said a few days after my wedding she received an Instagram follow and message from someone she didn\u2019t know. The gist of the message was that it was from the assistant coordinator at my wedding.  He pretty much said that he was working and couldn\u2019t say anything but he noticed her at the wedding and thought she was really beautiful and he wanted to ask her on a date. She asked how he found her and he \u201cproudly\u201d said that he noticed her, looked up the seating chart of the table she was seated at for dinner, and looked up every girl at the table until he found her.  She said she wasn\u2019t comfortable with that and blocked him. She told me it was funny in hindsight but at the time she was a little uncomfy. Clara did emphasize to me she didn\u2019t think it was a big deal.  Would I be an asshole if I told my wedding planner friend about what happened? She will most likely report him to the head of the company and maybe he will or maybe he won\u2019t be fired. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m being vindictive or not. It doesn\u2019t sit right that we paid a guy to do a job and he ended up stalking and DMing my friend. ",

        "selftext": "I feel like this is kinda overreacting but maybe I\u2019m just wrong. My girlfriend\u2019s (26F) birthday was coming up and I wanted to get her something really nice. I\u2019ve noticed throughout our whole relationship that she does her makeup on the floor in front of a mirror and it always looks so uncomfortable. She has complained of it several times, so I decided it would be a great idea to get her a vanity set. I did some research and I found a couple she would like, but I knew she was picky and so I asked her if she was planning on buying a vanity set ever. She showed me the vanity set she wanted and I made sure to add that set to my Amazon list. A few months went by and I was ready to buy the set but I come to find out that it was sold out. I desperately looked at other sites and the manufacturer, but the set would not come for over a month after her birthday (keep in mind that I decided to buy it a month before, so it was not last minute). I still felt bad and so I decided to spend some more time researching what set to buy. I finally came across one that matched the style and color of other furniture that she had purchased and it was more expensive than the one she wanted so I bought it thinking she\u2019d like it even if it was the one she didn\u2019t ask for. I WAS WRONG. My girlfriend\u2019s birthday finally comes around and she goes off to her sisters while I spend 2 hours building this set right after work. When she finally comes home and I show it to her, I could clearly tell something was wrong. She was quiet and didn\u2019t seem too happy. She then started bawling her eyes out saying that she hates it because it wasn\u2019t the one she wanted. I explained to her that I couldn\u2019t get the one she wanted yet but if she didn\u2019t like it that much I could wait for it to come back and buy it and sell the one I just bought it. That only made her even more mad and upset. She then went on a rant about how she hates birthdays and that I shouldn\u2019t have gotten her anything. Again, this vanity set matches everything else she likes and it wasn\u2019t some cheap set. She told me to simply sell the set and keep the money because she does not want anything from me on her birthday. AITA for getting her the wrong set?",

        "selftext": "Right now I feel bad about this situation while also feeling some resentment towards my family. My sister lives about 20 minutes from me, near our parents. There was a family emergency where she needed to meet my parents at the hospital, and taking her kids wasn\u2019t an option. She called me up at 6:45 PM on her way to my apartment to tell me she needed to drop off the kids quickly and run. I tried to tell her that I was not in the right condition for that. She told me it was an emergency and she had no other option. I begged her to call her mother in law. She said that wouldn\u2019t work. When she showed up, she stepped inside my apartment to hand off her kids. Like I told her, I wasn\u2019t in condition for this. My friend and I had been celebrating her new job. My sister was shocked and disgusted and dragged her kids off, but not before telling me what a pathetic loser she thinks I am. She ended up texting me a novel about how disappointed she is, how upsetting it is for her kids to have walked into my apartment reeking of weed, how I\u2019m 27 and should be over that phase of my life, etc. She ripped into me for still living with 5 roommates, not having a car, all this other stuff. It was deeply hurtful and I just apologized for not being able to help her and the kids. Of course I had no idea there could be an emergency like this, but you never know. That\u2019s why it\u2019s an emergency. Yes I live with 5 people but they are my friends and we need each other to afford living here. I don\u2019t have a car because I can\u2019t drive. Weed is legal here and it's not a crime to smoke once in a while. My sister said she was so disgusted with me that she brought my parents into it. They have all banded together to let me know what a piece of shit I am for not living up to anyone\u2019s expectations. I do feel a little bit defensive because I had no way of knowing this would happen. So I guess my question boils down to am I the asshole because I was not ready for an emergency at my big age of 27? Did I really let my family down? Ok I got the post to let me edit it and someone told me to add that the reason I can't drive is because I medically can't drive (and never can, for my whole entire life sadly). ",

        "selftext": "When I was 17 my mom came into money.  She tried to keep it quiet but she paid off my dad\u2019s debts, bought him a small house, paid off her debts and paid for my sister\u2019s college and set up funds for mine.  She had a boyfriend at the time and shortly after him and his son who was 7 moved into our new house. Over the next few years mom bought my sister a house after she graduated college. Her boyfriend lived with us and didn\u2019t pay anything but he did work. When I was 21 mom got diagnosed with cancer. It wasn\u2019t good. She sat me and my sister down and went over exactly how much money there was. She intended to give her current house to me and both me and my sister were left with a large sum at the end of it.  She asked if I would allow her boyfriend to stay in the house with his son until he got his own place. I agreed. Before she died she told her boyfriend he would need to look for his own place but had time to save more for that journey. For the last 4 years he has continued to reside in the house with his son. I haven\u2019t minded because we get along okay. I pay all the bills but he does buy food for him and his kid. He has dated off and on and mostly kept the women out of this house which I respected him for.  Until his current partner.  She\u2019s been in my house 3 times and at first besides feeling a little uncomfortable I was okay with her. The last time this past weekend was the point where I lost my shit. I was making myself some lunch when she came walking downstairs. She grabbed a plate and went to grab food out of my pan. I asked her what she thought was doing. She started telling me how I should look for somewhere else to live and leeching off my dead mom\u2019s past relationship as an adult was pathetic. I hollered for my mom\u2019s old boyfriend he came down and I told him I didn\u2019t know what he current thing thought but I wasn\u2019t going to be disrespected in my house.  He wouldn\u2019t even look me in the eyes as he mumbled something about my mom promising him the house and he was just \u201cbeing kind\u201d letting me stay. First that isn\u2019t remotely true. Mom pulled him and i together after she asked if he could stay to set expectations. My mom met him shortly before she won the money and told him and us girls that she had no intention of leaving him money. She did set aside a fund for his son for college when he gets there but he cannot touch it, only his son can.  He has lived in this house almost 8 years without paying a dime he should have plenty of money and if he doesn\u2019t that\u2019s on him. I told him he had 30 days to leave. I wasn\u2019t going to house someone who would lie and disrespect me in my house. He left that night with his son but his ex wife called to tell me I am cruel and an AH for her son losing his house (he is here every other week). I really feel like my mom didn\u2019t expect him to still be here but my sister said she feels like I am breaking my promise to my mom and  that made me feel like maybe I am the AH.",

        "selftext": "Last September my uncle Daniel (43) came up to me (22) looking all stressed and asked if I could have a sit down with him as he needs a Favour. He begun to speak on how he was really on a rough financial spot, and he really had nowhere to turn to as he didn't have anyone to ask for a loan from and I was the only one left available.  Mind you I'm not rich or anything of the sort, I just happened to have the amount he needed at the time. According to him it was a serious situation that he couldn't approach or tell other guys in the family, and the issue needed to be addressed soon. Without better judgement I lent him the cash after much insisting from him. We agreed on payment before December, and I didn't even ask for any interest on it. With lots of hugs and words, he took it and gave me his word on the paying it. Fast forward and we are now at Christmas dinner at my grandma's house, and all that time I didn't give him any reminders or a checkup. I assumed he was late or something and he would let me know why at Christmas dinner because the larger family meets every year for that. He also didn't call or say anything to update on his situation and I just had to trust all was well. Now on a related side note for later, my cousin Aisha, (20, Daniel's daughter) recently underwent surgery a while back as she really had it tough for the whole of last year while she recovered from a traumatic back injury from an accident. Everyone was enjoying their meal and suddenly my uncle stood up at the dinner table and called for attention for a speech. He began to speak on how his business took a really huge boost and long story short, how he has just cashed in a large profit from some deals. He looked at Aisha across the table and took out some brochure with some resort looking location and said it was a gift to her for her tough recovery from the incident. All I could see was Aisha visibly crazy excited. Someone asked what it was exactly, and Daniel said he was planning on taking Aisha and the rest of his family to the Maldives as a celebration on Aisha's accident recovery. Everyone was now happily cheering Aisha on her gift as it seemed it was something she always wanted to experience. You can afford all that but not repay my debt which you haven't said anything on, the words just slipped out of my subconscious mind as I looked at him straight in the eye. His words were why are you talking about that now of all places. Now I was pissed, I reminded him Infront of everyone on the exact amount and I told him the fact on how he wasn't even communicating on repaying it. The entire family was in shock with dead silence as my mom hurriedly changed the subject to avoid an escalation of the situation. Later on, in the evening my aunt, grandma, and some cousins began to lecture me on how I ruined Aisha's moment after her struggles and embarrassed my uncle in the process. They leave in a week, and he still hasn't paid or mention anything on the debt. AITAH for ruining the moment and asking for repayment?

My favorite show is RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race, which airs on Friday nights. My husband does not like this show, which is his right, and when I watch it, he feels the need to go in the basement for the entire hour and a half that it\u2019s on. It\u2019s recently caused a lot of contention in our relationship because he feels that he shouldn\u2019t have to be relegated to the basement on Friday nights after he works hard.

        "selftext": "Throwaway account. For the past 8 years, I (32M) have been paying my parents\u2019 property taxes and mortgage. They are retired and have very little retirement savings because they put all their money into my sister (29F) and I's education. We both went to top universities and found successful jobs afterwards. I felt like I owed my parents for all they sacrificed for me, so it was a no brainer to help them retire with no financial stress. My parents did not consult my sister about splitting these costs with me; instead, the agreement was that I would get a larger share of the house. Fast forward to now, my sister unfortunately lost her job last year and as a result, doesn't have much savings. She moved in with my parents to save money while she looks for a job. I recently found out that my sister pitched staying permanently in my parents' house, and my parents agreed. I was furious at this, because I had been paying for the house with the understanding that it would be sold and I would get a larger share. It is very likely my sister never sells the house and instead raises her eventual family there. Because the original agreement with my parents changed, I stopped paying for the mortgage, leaving it up to my sister to take care of if she's taking over the house. My parents are furious with me, saying I'm too money-obsessed and should be continuing to help the family while my sister is in a tough spot still looking for a job. Instead, they are promising that eventually my sister will pay me out for my share of the house plus whatever else I contributed over 8 years. I turned that offer down because there's no real guarantee this will happen and I don't trust my sister to follow through financially. I may be the asshole for taking such a cynical stance and leaving my family in financial stress, but I feel like I was already burned once through verbal agreements and I don't want to get burned again. AITA? Edit: My sister is fully opposed to selling the house because of the sentimental value. I'm not on the deed because when you put someone else on the deed in CA, your house is re-assessed and it will double our current property tax. There are also some implications to my parents social security payments if I do so. I wish I got something in writing but i felt like an asshole asking for something like that from my family. It was naive of me to think that way ",

        "selftext": "Between Christmas and New Years, me (43m) and my wife (43f) went to hang out and drink at my sister in laws (32f) house while her husband (wife's brother) and son went away for a few nights. Basically a normal night, my wife and I went over to keep my sil company. Played board games, drank etc.... My sil is very proper, fashionable, basic white girl. Maybe 5'2 and 100lbs. Anyhoo, we're in the living room, my wife passes out on the couch so we decide to call it a night sleeping on the couch. My sil gets up to go to bed, a little wobbly but she goes into the bathroom and shuts the door. I play on my phone for about 45 minutes and I notice she's still in the bathroom. So I knock on the door with no response, I knock a few more times then open the door to look in. She's a naked pooper, she passed out while pooping apparently and fell off the toilet onto the floor. Somewhere in all that she puked all over herself. So I'm left with a completely naked woman covered in puke, poop and pee. I try to wake my wife up but she's out cold, I try to wake my sil up but she's out cold. So I grab a bunch of towels, just do a quick clean up. Get the heavy stuff off of her, clean up the floor and made her a bed of towels so she didn't have to sleep on the cold tile, propped her head on a folded towel as a pillow and used a giant fluffy towel as a blanket.  Here's why I'm told I'm an asshole. She was mad I let her lay in poop/puke all night. I should have picked her up and put her in the tub and bathed her. She was passed out drunk, I didn't think she wanted me touching her intimate areas. Where she replied that I have a wife and daughter, I've seen a vagina before and I've changed my daughter's diapers/baths so I know how to clean a vagina/butt/breast. She's only 100lbs so it would have been easy for me. My wife sides with me but the other women say that I should have cleaned her better. So am I an asshole? Would you want someone touching you while you're passed out?  ",

        "selftext": "My teenager turned 16 today. They are also autistic. This morning they came out complaining about a rash from shaving, stating that it hurt too much to have air blow on it or cloth against it & therefore they weren\u2019t going to school. I gave them a few hours & tried again. They still wouldn\u2019t go. Gave it a few more hours, same result. Now it\u2019s too late to go to school. So I told them to text their friends & tell them that the dinner party @ a midprice restaurant is off. Now they & their sibling (21) are calling me an asshole. I feel like if I let them have the dinner out tonight after they called out of school is rewarding a negative behavior. If they were diabetic & had to go to the ER because of a low blood sugar then were released I still wouldn\u2019t let them go out to a dinner. Not that they\u2019d feel up to it then I imagine. So is this just me being a good parent or me being an asshole? Edit: I\u2019m still going to give them their birthday card/gift tonight. I haven\u2019t decided if the makeup dinner would be here or @ the original restaurant on a later night. Edit 2: they used to chew the collars off of their school uniform shirts because they didn\u2019t like the feeling of the fabric against their neck. So when they showed me that they did indeed have a raised/red rash from shaving that was too painful for school I agreed to let them stay home. I gave them medicated creams/lotions for the rash. I checked in on them several times throughout the day to see if they were feeling better. If the rash is the reason that you are staying home from school @ 0830, 1100, & 1300 then it\u2019s also the reason that you aren\u2019t going out to dinner @ 1700.Clarification of edit 2: using the shirt collar chewing as an example of understanding that they do have sensory issues. The rash is not on the neck. & also showing that by offering to let them stay home/offering medications throughout the day to show that I understand that the sensory issues can lessen with a little time as could have the rash. Clarification 3: it is a known rule in our household that if one is \u201ctoo much\u201d of something to go to school that day then one is not allowed to do \u201cfun\u201d events the rest of that day. That expectation as a consequence was reiterated each time that they were checked on & asked about whether or not they wanted to go to school. To have to explicitly state that feels really weird.",

        "selftext": "This might be a bit long so I'll put a tl;dr at the end!  I (19f) have a brother (24m) that I'll call Liam. Earlier this year, he started dating a girl he met at his climbing class that I'll call Emma (26f). They've been together for 4 months and this weekend he decided to introduce her to us.  They arrived yesterday and are staying until tonight. She is a really nice person and we got along well. Then at one point my dad asked her what she did in life and she said she was a lawyer. I was super interested because I'm currently studying law and have wanted to be a lawyer since I was maybe 10, so I was very excited to ask her questions about it. I asked about cases that she had, how she studied to become a lawyer, what her days looked like and many more things. I might've been a little over enthusiastic and annoying but I didn't realize it at the time and was just excited to get to ask someone questions about my dream job.  But at one point she said something that seemed incoherent to me. The details might be long and boring but basically she just said something that isn't technically possible. So I was curious and a bit confused and I asked her how that was possible because I just thought she's the professional so she must know better than me. But as she tried to explain it she just said more incoherent and impossible things. It was kind of like if someone was quoting things from Grey's Anatomy to doctors if you see what I mean. So I asked more about it to understand and that's when she admitted that she wasn't actually a lawyer and worked at a bookstore.  She told us that she was very sorry for lying and then left the table and my brother followed her. My parents kind of scolded me for being so intrusive and when my brother came back he was a bit angry. He started telling me that I was wrong for interrogating her and that I made her uncomfortable, and that she had lied because she was embarrassed about her job and I just made her more embarrassed. Now he hasn't been talking to me since and neither has Emma.  I'm not sure I'm in the wrong here but they all seem to think so. I get that me asking questions was annoying and maybe a bit too much but I truly didn't have bad intentions I was just excited to be able to talk about it with someone. And also I don't understand how everyone is so okay with the fact that she lied to my brother for 4 months and then also lied to us. I get being embarrassed but I don't know it's still a bit weird to me. But I never meant to make her uncomfortable and I genuinely liked her. I don't see how I'm in the wrong but maybe I just can't see it so please tell me so that I can have another perspective. Tl;dr: We met my brother's girlfriend and she told us she was a lawyer so I asked her questions because I was interested. But she said some incoherent things and then admitted she was lying about her job. They blame me for asking too many questions. Edit: For everyone wondering if I'm on the spectrum or neurodivergent in any way, I haven't been diagnosed with anything but many doctors and teachers of mine have mentioned it to me. I can understand why but I don't want to self diagnose obviously. I haven't been able to get tested because my parents don't believe in that stuff but as soon as I'm fully independent (financially, and living on my own) I will get tested.",

Grandma asked me not to tell anyone about this and I didn\u2019t. I kept my mouth shut. When my dad and uncles found out, they reacted in different ways. Dad wasn\u2019t really that surprised since Grandma was rather charitable, especially in her later years. Uncle Henry was grateful for the fund but \u2018Uncle John\u2019 was quite upset, saying that she\u2019s their mom and should have left them something All three of them got suspicious and asked me if Grandma told me about this during one of the afternoons I spent at her place. I admitted that I knew about it and Uncle John said I should\u2019ve told them first instead of letting them find out this way. That it wouldn\u2019t hurt so much if he had time to prepare instead of being caught off guard.",

His family and friends act like I\u2019m responsible for his social calendar, which I didn\u2019t mind at first because I didn\u2019t have anything better to do but I\u2019m tired of being the one to have to say no to everything and it sucks having to deal with people trying to convince me to come to things when I know they only really care about my husband attending. I\u2019ve tried to get them to go to him directly but he just sends them back my way or ignores them so they come to me anyway. I\u2019ve spoken to him multiple times about not wanting to be responsible for \u2018our\u2019 social calendar and he acts like he gets it but then never responds to invites so nothing\u2019s changed. So I\u2019ve done something that you guys may or may not think is petty. My mother-in-law has asked for us to join monthly family dinners with her side of the family. I prefer her side of my husband\u2019s family but my husband is closer to his dad\u2019s side so we see them more. Usually, I wouldn\u2019t accept an invite like this without checking with my husband but since she asked him first and he ignored her I decided to accept on his behalf. The first dinner is on Sunday which is the day we were also supposed to have dinner with his grandfather on his dad\u2019s side but he never told me that was happening and neither did anyone else (his dad\u2019s side have a horrible habit of just assuming we\u2019ll be at something because they\u2019ve told us). Part of me thinks the dinner with his grandfather is a lie because I know he\u2019s been avoiding his half-brother like the plague since he keeps asking him for an investment and his stepsiblings will be there. My husband told me to cancel but I don\u2019t want to because my mother-in-law was so happy when I said yes. Also, his sister will be there and I haven\u2019t seen her in forever. I won\u2019t stop him from cancelling if he really wants to but he\u2019s turned this situation into a fight because I didn\u2019t ask him first and now I don\u2019t want to be the one to cancel. He\u2019s basically said if we go to the first one he expects me to tell my mother-in-law this won\u2019t be a regular thing but I think he should be the one to do that since I have no problem having dinner with them regularly.

        "selftext": "The recent family Christmas party was at my (22M) house this year and about 25 people showed up. The traditional game this year was White Elephant. My family plays the dice version with some house rules for context. - Anyone who doesn't have a gift by the end of the game will receive $10 as a gift. - Trading gifts is allowed only with the $10 consolation gift.  The game had a total of about 40 gifts; I ended the game with 4 gifts, and 4 family members ended with none. My gifts were: a space heater, windshield wipers, a 20-pound gummy bear, and a $50 Starbucks gift card. Of the 4 people without gifts, 3 of them got rejected meaning only one trade was made. My cousin (26F) ended with $50 worth of lottery tickets but assumed they'd be worth nothing and I don't go to Starbucks. We couldn't trade because of the rules above and argued that the gift cards and lottery tickets had a numerical value like the $10 gifts so they should be tradeable. The family agreed and more gift cards were exchanged.  Trading ended and people began using their gifts so I went to put my gifts back in my room and a quarter to scratch the 5 $10 tickets. I wasn't expecting to win anyway; as I thought that scratching the second about to move on to the third, I did a double take as I realized I'd won $25,000. For I second I thought they were fake but my Grandma (82F) who bought them wouldn't do that. I sat in my room for a bit and decided to keep quiet about it knowing how some family members might react. I thought about how to tell them throughout the party, when they asked I said no and that I threw them out.  The next day (the 29th), I asked my Mom (58F) to come with me to cash in the lottery ticket. She was surprised of course and told me that I needed to go to the Casino. My brother (28M) thought it was funny and tagged along. He proceeded to post snaps of me being handed $100 bills in the casino. Although I told him not to say anything because of the commotion it would cause and that I'd share some with the family, he posted it anyway.  An hour passes and I'm pulled into a group chat of people from the party plus family members that couldn't make it. I said I'd give everyone who came to the party $250 and thought I was being selfish. For 30ish people that attended that's $7,500 right there, I felt that was fair. Family members who weren't there argued that they shouldn't be excluded, others argued that $250 isn't enough if I have $25K. After about 30 minutes of arguing, I was pissed and gave up negotiating. I told everyone that I'm sorry that they're not happy with your WE gifts this year and that the rule was that all trades are final.  I kept all the money, put $15K in my savings, and invested the rest. Many of my family members are still upset with me even as far as calling me cruel and heartless. I told them that if $250 isn't enough from a $100 limit, they're the selfish ones.  AITA? *Note that no household or individual family member is struggling financially. ",

        "selftext": "For context : I had my first daughter during pandemic and lockdowns. Husband was working overseas and planned to come before delivery but due to Australian border being shut, he was unable to come and after a painful 1.5 years apart, we finally reunited and he got to hold our firstborn. I am pregnant again and have kept my pregnancy a secret from family and friends. Only my parents and in-laws know. My parents will be coming from overseas when I am 30 weeks to stay and support me in my delivery. Husband wants to go overseas to see his parents for 10 days but I don't want him to go. He says he won't be able to go this year once baby comes. But his parents are planning on visiting us once the baby is a couple of months old so he shall get to see them this year anyway. AITA if I don't want him to go? I will be 31 weeks pregnant but I feel after last time of missing pregnancy and delivery of our firstborn , it should be him not wanting to go instead of me having to ask. He says that even his mum is telling him not to come but he wishes to go.  Update : First, I would like to say thank you to each and everyone of you for reading and commenting on my post. It is my first ever Reddit post and I was not expecting it to gain so much traction. I was hoping to reply to each and every one of you but with pregnancy fatigue and no time with a toddler, I decided to post an update. I was going to post it yesterday because it would have been a happy update but after today, my whole world has gone upside down. So two nights ago, I had a bit of a cry. Husband came and sat next to me and asked what happened and I told him that even though I would be 7 months only, I still didn't want him to go. He assured me he wouldn't. He said he wasn't planning to anyway but he sees my point and my point was that even though I would have my parents and I had my parents with me last pregnancy and delivery, it would not be the same as having your own spouse. Since he agreed so quickly without me having to beg or explain, I quickly ended that discussion and we went to sleep happily. Before I fast forward to today morning I would like to add some background info : Ever since we got married 8 years ago, I have noticed him taking his phone to the toilet. I have expressed my disgust at it and asked him not to but he still does. I have asked him why it takes so long for him to do his business on the toilet and he says he suffers from constipation. I have told him to get it checked by a doctor but he won't and claims it's normal and runs in his family so I have given up. Since two years I have noticed he wakes up at 4 in the morning to spend an hour in the toilet. That's the time my daughter and I are fast asleep and he wakes up at 5 to go to work but some nights, I wake up to an empty bed and he is in toilet. I have never told him about this because then he will start hiding even more from me. I have tried snooping on his phone but he always has it locked with a pattern that even though he unlocks in front of me, he does it so quickly and it's a complicated pattern so I am unable to memorise it lol. He leaves his phone out (recently realised it's always on silent and with notifications muted) and sometimes hands me his phone, so I brushed off my fears that something could be happening. Post covid when we reunited, I felt that because we were apart, we would be closer than ever to make up for missed time but he felt distant and after an argument where I accused him of cheating, he handed me his phone to prove he wasn't. In front of him, I looked through his phone and the only thing I found was that his Google Chrome was open to an insta account. No dp, no posts, no following but he was following 40 female celebrities. I asked him about it and he shrugged and didn't find it odd like I did. I angrily asked if I opened a secret insta account and followed only male celebs, would he like it? He said he wouldn't mind. I told him I didn't like it and he got defensive that they are politicians, UFC fighters and of course Hollywood and Bollywood stars and he just follows them and that's not cheating. I didn't like it but had to leave it at that. Today morning, he woke up and unbeknownst to him, I was awake but had my eyes closed. He took his phone, and I opened my eyes and saw that he had tonnes of messages on his notification bar. When he clicked on it, it took him to threads (didn't know he was on threads, and I don't know if it took him to app or a Google Chrome tab) and he scrolled through messages. I don't know who it is or what the messages said. He tilted his phone away from me to scroll through the messages and a while later, went to the toilet most probably to respond.I wish I knew the tech to look through his phone because I always wonder how do other people catch their spouses when I can't even get through his phone because of the pattern locking etc. My heart has dropped that he might be cheating but I feel like I shall go crazy without proof. I don't know what to do. Also my phone has a numerical password that he knows and I don't mind because I have nothing to hide. Should I ask to check his phone again? I checked his account from my threads and he joined it last year September. Again, no profile pic or threads. It's like a ghost account. I feel sick that I am having a baby with him but he never acted fishy otherwise for me to suspect something could be happening. ",

        "selftext": "I (27f) have been best friends with Kira (27f) since we were little. We were neighbors, went to the same school, college, etc. She was my MoH when I married Rowan (28m), who we went to college with. At first, Kira had a big crush on him, but he started liking me. We slowly got closer and I started liking him too (this was after Kira had told me she'd gotten over it and was dating another guy). But I still felt really guilty and didn't want to date him if it would hurt Kira. I asked her multiple times if she was okay with it and she said she was, so I thought it was fine. Kira's been with her latest boyfriend, Adam (27m), for a year or so. However, over the last few months, she's been acting strange around Rowan. Whenever we'd be hanging out with the three of us, or even with Adam there, she'd always find some way to sit next to Rowan, laugh at everything he said, etc. I didn't think anything of it initially because I knew that's kind of her personality, and her and Rowan are friends. But then she started always asking me if Rowan was there before she came over and if I said no, she'd often suddenly say she couldn't come, though sometimes she would say that even if I said he was here. Rowan also told me about a comment she made to him once about how he was so patient for putting up with me being too tired to do anything with him now that I was pregnant, which I thought was weird. The odd behavior continued but tbh the pregnancy had been keeping me too exhausted to give it a lot more thought, and Rowan seemed as friendly with Kira as always. But two days ago, our mutual friend Shay threw a dinner party. Me and Rowan went, as did Kira and Adam. Kira got a bit tipsy, and she kept trying to sit with Rowan and touch him. He excused himself a few times but she kept finding him. I tried to get her off a few times, and I was getting mad because this was a new line she was crossing. She was slurring about how I stole Rowan from her. Thankfully Adam was too busy talking to Shay's husband to hear this, but he definitely saw Kira's actions. The next afternoon, I was at Shay's again with some friends when Kira showed up. She was crying about how Adam had broken up with her that day, saying he didn't think they were going to work out. Everyone was consoling her, but I was just kind of sitting there. I couldn't help but feel like she brought this upon herself. She asked me Aren't you going to say something? so I said Maybe Adam wouldn't have left you if you weren't trying to get with Rowan all the time. Some of our other friends were shocked to hear this and got mad at Kira. Some got angry with me, saying Kira was just really friendly with everyone and that was a horrible accusation to make. Kira was upset, saying she couldn't believe I thought that of her and maybe we really weren't that close. She left in tears and I left soon after too. Now I don't know, maybe I was wrong? Kira had been drinking at the dinner party and might not have meant what she said, and the other stuff could've been nothing. Maybe this was too harsh to say to her after a breakup and we could've talked privately, not in front of our friends. AITA?",

        "selftext": "I kicked them out because they refused to take off their shoes as it's a celebration at our house.  For backstory, it was my daughter's first birthday. My partner is white and I am asian. It has been the norm in our household to keep shoes off when we're at home and we also wear indoor footwear/slippers. I have always kept spa slippers for guests in variety of sizes in case some are not comfortable in going barefoot. I have always kept my house clean  and have always maintained outdoor shoes/footwear off when inside our house. Not only does it makes cleaning floors easy, the thought of carrying germs inside is gross and scary to me. It's also a cultural norm for us as well to keep shoes off as a sign of respect to the owners of the house.Now my daughter's birthday has come. The first few guests have arrived and has taken cue that shoes should be off and I've offered spa slippers and some were happy to wear them and some just went barefoot inside.  Now my partner's dad and his fiance arrived along with their children (His parents are divorced). And they went straight in with their filthy shoes on. Like really gross looking shoes, that were not clean looking and you can see the dirt sticking to my tiles. I told my partner to tell them to take off shoes please because the other guests were happy to comply and thought they would do the same. Well they didn't do that and just kept walking around inside with the shoes on and stepping on the rugs and mats with it. I politely asked again, but his dad grunted and said our shoes are clean, we always wash them weeklyI pointed out the dirt on the floor and he said it's the dirt from when they walk on our front yard so its mainly part of our house. I explained again that kids and most especially his grandchild crawls around our floor and since it's her birthday to just take their shoes off the mat where she crawls.This time he seems offended and started with why I am making such a big deal out of wearing shoes inside when it's a party anyway and I'm ruining such an important day because I could not bend a little rule for one day. And it's white people culture to not take their shoes off anyway. That's when I lost it and said they can get out of my house if they can't do a simple request.And they left and my partner said I should've just let it go since they travelled quite far to come for our daughter's birthday and I'm an asshole for not being considerate for only one day. So AITA? Wow this got so much attention and I'm showing this to my partner! Posted this on comments: Before having our baby, when they used to visit they know we have a shoes off rule at our old apartment. My partner has always pointed this out to them but I would not make a fuss because they only see us on occasion - like maybe once/twice a year. This time though, we moved to a bigger house and I have a one year old that crawls around and it's mainly because there are other babies and kids too especially in the play area. I was adjusting to the thought that they can wear shoes then on other areas of the house except on her playmat (it's a very large foamy/soft playmat that covers most of the room) but they didn't want to follow on that either. Even their children hasn't taken off their shoes when they started to hung out with the other kids to play and that's where the blow-up happened. He wanted to hand my daughter their gift in the playroom when we also have a designated area to put the gifts. And people commenting about the slippers: they are those disposable spa slippers(bought off at amazon like $10 for 20pcs) that I threw out once used except for my usual guests which are my close friends who now has their own slippers marked in my house.

        "selftext": "My husband is a nice guy, but sometimes he doesn\u2019t listen to me and that really triggers me if he does it frequently enough. For example, he will ask if i want some oranges, i\u2019ll say no thank you, then he\u2019ll peel some oranges for me and offer me some, and then i\u2019ll say no thank you, and he leaves the bowl of oranges there. But imagine this happens for multiple scenarios daily. 95% of our fights is because he does not listen to me, and thinks he knows better and keeps insisting and imposing his ideas on me. Today, i was holding our baby daughter (2 months) and eating. He told me to eat first and he will hold our daughter. I told him, I\u2019m fine, it\u2019s finger food and I got it. I told him to eat first and then rear the toddler/baby after. Well he insisted I should eat first and told me to give him the baby. I told him again, NO i\u2019m ok, i can hold the baby. He then came over and grabbed the baby and repeatedly said \u201ceat! Eat first! I\u2019ll eat after\u201d. I told him explicitly, \u201cNO, let go. No i\u2019m fine. No don\u2019t take her. you aren\u2019t listening to me and this WILL lead to a fight, this is disrespectful, please stop\u201d while maintaining my hold on our baby. He kept grabbing the baby from my arms and I finally let go because i didn\u2019t want to make our baby feel uncomfortable or worse hurt her (like god forbid we drop her while both trying to grab her). I was so pissed off he would not listen to me again and went as far as \u201cstarting a tug a war\u201d with our baby.  He says he\u2019s always trying to just be nice and I end up snapping at him. It\u2019s also important to know what we value the most in relationship is different. He values feeling like he\u2019s cared for and loved. I value being respected. I told him by not listening to me repeatedly (multiple times a week), he\u2019s disrespecting me. So now I feel crazy. I know he's trying to be nice but I end up a fight about how he doesn't listen to me at least twice a month. Edit: no, i don't think this is abusive because it's a learned behavior. He does this with his mom (and vice versa). And after his mom gives in, she laughs and says aww my son is so filial. Apparently they enjoy this. Fml. This behavior has exponentially gotten worse since his mom moved in (which is a totally different issue)",

We\u2019re planning family vacation and discussing sleeping situations & cost for the cabin we\u2019ll share this summer. I would have to share a room with my parents. I don\u2019t really mind sharing but would love to have my own space. Unfortunately, that isn\u2019t possible where we vacation. Cost is cabin + pet fee, divided by couple but they want me to pay the same amount they are paying.  Considering it\u2019s just me and I won\u2019t have my own space for my only vacation of the year, I don\u2019t think I should have to pay the same amount as everyone else. I could go have a quiet vacation solo for the same price. They\u2019ll also calculate food cost and divide it evenly. I\u2019m truly not asking for a big discount lol.

I\u2019ve been told \u201cwe do it every day, it\u2019s your turn\u201d in regards to taking care of the kids numerous times at gatherings. My response is always that I would have kids if I wanted to do it every day. They seem to think I don\u2019t deserve to relax because I\u2019ve decided not to have children. I hate missing out on time with the kids but know I would 100% end up taking care of them (all under 3yo) while the rest of the adults drink and it wouldn\u2019t be much of a vacation for me. I didn\u2019t go last year for this reason. ",

        "selftext": "I (M28) live with my twin brother (M28) and have for a few years. Our dynamic is typically fine but he\u2019ll take advantage of me at times, like playing my PlayStation when he didn\u2019t ask, and taking various things out of my room without asking. (He\u2019ll give them back after I have to ask) I have weather related allergies and take a loratadine pill as needed. A few months ago, I bought a bottle of 90 pills for a total of $36 from a local drug store.  I don\u2019t take them every day and there\u2019s 90 in the bottle so it\u2019s hard to keep track of them. A few months ago though I did notice that the bottle seems to be getting emptier despite me not taking a pill every day. I thought that was a little odd but didn\u2019t really think anything else of it. But then just about a month ago, I noticed it significantly more empty than before. So I decided to count them and found there were about 15 pills or so in the bottle.  Fast forward to last night, I wanted to take a pill, so I opened the bottle and noticed there was 1 pill left. I immediately suspected my brother of taking them, without asking obviously.  So I confronted him about it.  He admitted to taking them, but he questioned how many I think he took. I said I obviously didn\u2019t have a clue but it seems like it\u2019s been happening for months. He got incredibly defensive and said \u201cbro it\u2019s just loratadine. It\u2019s a fucking allergy pill, not money, not a prescription.\u201d  I said that it\u2019s the principle, it doesn\u2019t matter what it is, you don\u2019t steal.  I then demanded he replace the product. To go CVSs website and order the exact bottle, because it\u2019s a 1 for 1 comp. That\u2019s the price I paid for the product. He thought that was absolutely ridiculous, because he can get a bottle of like 300 pills on Amazon for like $15, instead of 90 for $36. Is it more expensive? Yes. But that\u2019s the price I paid, despite it being cheaper elsewhere. He wouldn\u2019t budge. He said I\u2019m ordering you this or nothing at all. He called me an asshole for demanding this but he doesn\u2019t see it that way at all.  So, Reddit. What are your thoughts? AITAH?",

        "selftext": "Hey everyone ! So, I know the title is awful, but that's literally what went on. For a bit of context, I (M22) have been dating my boyfriend Marc (M27) for two years. He has a daughter Lily, (F7), which is important for the story. I met my Marc five years ago, when I began babysitting his daughter while he worked, (single dad, mom is deceased), and since Lily and I got along great, I became the sole babysitter when he needed. It was practical because we were living two streets apart, and just overall the best choice because I was available, liked them and they liked me. But eventually, him and I fell in love, and I quickly moved in with him and his daughter, to whom I became a second dad.   But here's the core of the problem, my sister (F35) is married to my BIL (M33), so every family gathering, I see him. He's relatively a nice guy, though we're not friends, but he never met Marc. When I started dating Marc, he didn't want to come to my family gatherings at first, because he's not comfortable around people, he's a shy guy, and of course I understood that. But last week, it was my mom's birthday, and she really wanted him and our daughter to be there, so he finally accepted. When my sister and my BIL found out he would be there, they were mad at me, and I didn't understood why at first, until she took me apart and called me insensitive and egoistic toward my BIL for inviting him, even though I had no idea why it made him uncomfortable. Apparently, when he was young, his parents divorced because his dad cheated with his babysitter, and it caused him a traumatism. I told her it was bullshit, that my boyfriend was part of my life, part of my family and I wouldn't exclude him because her husband was uncomfortable. I also reminded her that there was no cheating, no breaking of trust or anything in my relationship with Marc, but she just called me insensitive again and left. My mom's birthday party was two days ago, and my family loved Marc and Lily. But all day, my sister and BIL kept glaring at us and muttering insults or mean comments under their breath. They brought it up again after dinner, but directly to my boyfriend and our daughter this time, telling her that your dad and his boyfriend are disgusting freaks or that he's a cheater who doesn't care about your dead mom. Obviously, my boyfriend and I absolutely lost it against them. Knowing my boyfriend's temper, I told him to take our daughter to the car while I was ripping a new one to my sister. We left shortly after, after apologizing to my mom for the mess it caused.   Now, my family's group chat is divided, mostly everyone is on our side, but a few of my extended relatives are on my sister/BIL's side, saying that we went too far, and should've just ignore them or went back home. Now, I know that my mom asked for them to come, but I'm feeling really guilty that it ruined her birthday's to have this drama. So, AITA?",

        "selftext": "My boyfriend (26m) and I (26f) have been together for about 8 months. We live together but have split financials. I worked hard and went to college, which is why I have a well paid job. When I met my boyfriend he didn't have a serious job, but he worked hard so we could live together and he now has a job with a decent income. He makes less than me and the rent etc. are divided pro rata. I paid for the first month of our rent (alone) and for our holidays and he still has to pay me back, but there's no rush as I don't need the money right away. We really love gaming together. He plays on his ps4 and I play on my nintendo switch. He mentioned he would like to buy a ps5 together so we can ditch the switch, because it's lagging alot. We did not talk about who would play on the ps4 and who would play on the ps5, but the costs would be split in half. I also said I would love to have a ps5, since I play on the switch and it sucks. My boyfriend does not have enough money and still had to pay me back for the vacation, so we dropped the subject. But since we've been gaming alot, my switch is starting to annoy me. The console is slow and it does not have enough capacity to load my games. That's why I decided to buy a ps5. I have more than enough savings to do so. I texted my boyfriend I wanted to buy a ps5 later that day and I did. Now my boyfriend's annoyed cause he wanted to buy a ps5 together. It would take some months before he would have enough savings, which is why I bought it myself. He also asked if the ps5 belonged to the both of us or just me. I responded that the ps5 is just mine untill he pays half of it, but he can always play on it if I'm not home. He got upset by this and said he was dissapointed. So, AITA for buying a ps5 without my boyfriend and saying it's mine?",

        "selftext": "I am the one in my family that hosts get togethers - holidays, graduation parties, showers, etc. I am an event planner and own a small event hall, so it just makes sense plus I genuinely enjoy it.  My side of the family is huge, lots of siblings and kids. I have always, ALWAYS offered up my event hall and planning for their use even though it comes at a cost for my business.  My niece (now 25f), we can call her Mary, has taken me up on that three times in the past - for her post-elopement party and two baby showers. For each of those she gave me no directions, just said do whatever you want. So I did, trying to keep her in mind.  At her first baby shower she turned up 30 minutes late in raggedy sweats, stayed long enough to eat and gather up the presents, then left. No thank-yous offered. My brother and SIL (her parents) made excuses, saying the pregnancy was very rough. So we made allowances for that. At her post-elopement dinner she again showed up late, stayed on her phone the whole time, ate and left. Again, no thank yous. When my mother commented on that, my brother said she was going through some newlywed stress as an excuse. Her second baby shower started the same way. When she asked me to gather up all the presents so she could leave, I suggested she stay and open them so everyone could enjoy seeing what was given. She scoffed and said, I don't want to stay at these little parties any longer than I have to. So I gathered up the presents and decided not to offer my little parties to her in the future. Fast forward to her sister's wedding shower. We have a delightful time, even though Mary has done the usual eat-then-leave without offering to help or just be there for her sister. My brother and I are loading up the presents when he mentions that Mary is expecting again and when can I host the shower. I told him I wouldn't be offering this time around and why. He was taken aback and said that he was surprised I was letting that comment get under my skin but whatever, my choice.  The next day I get an irate call from Mary. I remind her that she said she didn't care for my parties so why does she want it anyway? It turns out she got rid of all her baby supplies and needed a shower to get the presents. I told her to post her registry online and I'm sure people would help her out. She got angry and hung up. Then my brother calls. He says I'm being childish. I told him that if he wants the shower he can pay for it, and gave him the standard quote for that event cost. He just sputtered and said they'd have someone else host. The family is divided on this one. I still feel like I am not being unreasonable. AITA?",

        "selftext": "Backstory: One of my (29/F) best friends (32/F) got married last spring. Since she got married we do mostly group hangouts with her husband (38/M) my partner and some other friends. Which is totally fine and fun! Now: I have a Galentine\u2019s party every year for my girlfriends. Usually about 4-5 of us and we and all bring an appetizer and have wine, play some games etc.  I texted the group to let them know and everyone responded. My friend messaged me privately to say that if her husband can\u2019t come, she can\u2019t come and asked if he could come with her. I normally would welcome him, but no one else\u2019s husband or boyfriends will be there and it just isn\u2019t that kind of party lol. I told her that no one else\u2019s partners would be there and she said that since being married they are a \u201cpackage\u201d deal and only attend things together.  I told her I respected whatever arrangements they had in their marriage and if she wasn\u2019t able to attend, I understood. However, a few days later a mutual friend told me that they talked and she said she was hurt by the fact I wouldn\u2019t invite him and felt I was being rude.  I do plan to talk to her about it, but just need some feedback from Reddit.  Edit: a few words  Edit #2: Because a lot of people asked - this party is held on the 13th, not on Valentines Day.  Edit #3 to add: thanks everyone who has taken the time to respond. I had a lot of anxiety about this. I knew I had done the \u201cright\u201d thing in my head. But then I second guessed myself. Now I feel good in the boundaries I set.  Edit #4: Galentines Day \u201cA day to celebrate female friendship, similar to Valentine's Day but for friends instead of romantic partners. It's often celebrated on February 13, the day before Valentine's Day. \u201c it\u2019s for all female friendships and not just singles. UPDATE: My friend ended up reaching out to me. She said that her husband is uncomfortable with \u201cgirls nights\u201d or events that he cannot attend. He told her \u201cI know what happens at girls nights\u201d. I guess he was cheated on in his previous marriage and he said he worries a lot. ",

        "selftext": "So basically, at a family barbecue last weekend, my uncle (mid-50s) kept making creepy comments about my girlfriend Kate(21F) who I invited. At first, it was backhanded compliments like, *Wow, you\u2019re way too pretty for him,* but then it got worse-*I would have snatched you up back in the day,* and *Must be a struggle to compromise for me?* He even joked about how my girlfriend must get hit on all the time and how I should *keep an eye on her.* On top of that, he was being *way* too touchy, putting his hand on her lower back, touching her arm when he laughed, and even leaning in way too close while talking to her. My girlfriend was clearly uncomfortable but tried to brush it off. She told me privately that it made her uncomfortable,  I confronted him in front of everyone, straight-up calling him a creep and telling him to knock it off in a loud way. He got defensive, saying he was just joking, and my mom told me I was out of line for embarrassing him like that.  Some family members agreed with me, but others think I overreacted and should've handled it privately since everyone knows him as a joker and just loves making conversation which he is good at. Some male cousins of mine are insinuating I was jealous and exaggerating stuff because my uncle talked to their partners too and they didn't have any complaints like Kate. My Uncle said he was just making jokes, and he didn't mean any of them, and he is really disappointed that I looked at him as that kind of guy AITA for calling him out publicly instead of pulling him aside?

        "selftext": "TLDR; I\u2019m taking a day away from my husband and son to be comfortable with going back to work. Husband has never had a day alone with son so I asked him to try to figure it out but I\u2019ll be available if needed. He told his mother to come and help. I said no. He thinks I\u2019m ridiculous.  I (30F) and my husband (33M) welcomed our first child this past September. I have been fortunate to be on maternity leave but that ends next week. My husband had 2 months off and has been working full time since. He\u2019s off on Sundays and Mondays. I have never left my son except to go to a wedding in December but we were only away for 3 of his wake hours. My in laws watched over him and everything was fine.  I go back to work next week and my son will be attending day care. My husband is off this entire week and we\u2019ve just been taking a staycation. I told my husband though I want one day on my own to get more comfortable from being away from our baby and that I want him to have the day with the baby on his own. He has never been alone with him for more than an hour. He is a good father though and will help out when needed. But he has never been there for the full blown cries and fussiness while having to take care of the house.  A few days ago, we went to a friends house and our son was screaming bloody hell. Whenever I held him, he would calm down. Whenever my husband held him, he would just scream and cry even louder. So my husband just passed him along to me. I was getting frustrated cause I just wanted to relax with friends and he couldn\u2019t calm him down for a minute.  Today he tells me that his mom will be coming to help out. I asked him to tell her never mind cause he should be able to do it on his own. He called me ridiculous and it shouldn\u2019t matter but I think it really does. I can\u2019t be bothered at work unless absolutely necessary so I wanted t this to be our \u201ctrial\u201d. His mom will also be working on Mondays so it\u2019s not like she will be available to help out then. His mom is taking his side but of course she will cause our son is her only grandson.  So AITA for telling husband to figure it out and step up?  This is my first AITA post and I\u2019m frustrated just writing this so if you need more details to decide, just let me know and I\u2019ll respond.  ETA- I had a c section and I exclusively breastfed so I physically could not leave the baby in the first 2 months. My lactation consultant told me not to pump until after 2 months as I needed to establish my milk supply. He took care of my while I took care of baby. He doesn\u2019t do NOTHING. When I started pumping, husband was already at work. Husband does do feedings now.  ETA2 - this isn\u2019t a punch towards his mother. I adore her. It\u2019s really about him being independent with the baby. She helps us and I always appreciate it. Idk why yall think I\u2019m spiteful.  ETA3 - When my husband is home, I do separate myself from them by going to a different room. But he does often come to the room for help. I\u2019m not just dropping him off. ",

        "selftext": "I (28F) and my husband (27M) are expecting a baby soon. My parents live close by, while his mom is a few states away. I have a good relationship with his mom, but we aren\u2019t very close\u2014it\u2019s mostly polite conversations when she visits. I\u2019m happy for her to visit as soon as the baby is born. Since it\u2019s hard to predict the exact date, we plan to call her and my sister (who also lives out of state) when I go into labor. They know they\u2019re welcome to book a flight right away or wait until after the birth. Whatever works for them.  I recently told my husband I didn\u2019t want anyone staying overnight at our house for the first few days after birth. He seemed surprised but supported me, and we agreed to let everyone know. I told my mom first, explaining family is welcome to visit all day and into the evening, but I wanted the first few nights to bond as a family and adjust without overnight guests. This is our first (and likely only) baby, and I want to treasure those moments. I also explained that while I appreciate people wanting to help, having guests\u2014even well-meaning ones\u2014can be overwhelming. I have a lot of social anxiety/a low social battery and expect to feel exhausted and vulnerable after birth. \u00a0Not to mention both our mother\u2019s have no problem telling us what we are doing wrong and how we should be doing things. (My mom to me and his mom to him). I suspect it might be hard having people over all day when I am that tired and emotionally vulnerable right after giving birth, but I understand grandparents wanting to be around the baby right away and having some time to ourselves at night felt like a good compromise.\u00a0My mom understood and offered for my mother-in-law to stay at her house, which has a comfortable guest room. We also offered to pay for a nice water side hotel, giving her two options. When my husband explained this to his mom, she became upset and said if she couldn\u2019t stay with us, she wouldn\u2019t come at all. This response threw me off. We\u2019ve always hosted her before, even though having guests makes me anxious. I\u2019ve never said no because she\u2019s family and I feel I should get over my anxiety, but I feel the first few days after birth are different. My husband is supportive and says it\u2019s my decision, but I know he wants her to come. I want that too\u2014for her to meet her grandchild and for my husband\u2019s sake. But her reaction has left me feeling anxious and panicked about labor all of the sudden. I\u2019m torn. If I give in, I worry I\u2019ll feel overwhelmed and resentful, affecting the experience and weeks left leading up to it. If I don\u2019t, I\u2019m afraid it will hurt my relationship with her and disappoint my husband (even though it\u2019s her choice not to come). Does anyone have advice? Are the first few days after birth a good enough reason to stick to what makes me comfortable, even if it upsets her? I\u2019m trying to find a solution that works for everyone, but I\u2019m struggling.",

        "selftext": "I'm new to Reddit, so hopefully I do this right. I, 32 M, have been married to my wife Natalie, 30 F, for 4 years now. We have been living together with our 2 cats, Viktor and Warwick, since. The cats were mine before we got together, both of which I named after my favorite video game. Well, since Nat and I have been living together, she has been begging for a dog. Nat grew up with a Golden Retriever which she adored, and she had been pleading for us to get one. I was hesitant at first. I've never been much of a dog guy and I was unsure how the cats would react to having a dog around. Well, this Christmas, as a late Christmas gift, I caved, and surprised Nat with a Retriever puppy. I gave her permission to name the dog anything she wanted. Bitch. She chose Bitch. She said it'd be funny, and she'd always thought naming a female dog 'Bitch' was comical. I found it less funny. Not only would vets look down on us, but every Sunday, Nat and I babysit the neighbor's kids, 8 F and 6 M. What do we say when the kids ask about the fact the dog would have a collar with 'Bitch' on it? I thought it was stupid, and told her no. She told me I had just said she could name the dog, which is true, but I said I paid for the dog, and should at least approve the name. It's our dog after all. She said I was an asshole for taking away the freedom to name the puppy. AITA? **UPDATE:** Thank you all for the kind words and advice. My wife ended up finding out about this post through a Youtube short, which I find funny, since I never thought this post would blow up. I am at work now and we are trying to work it out over text, but my wife is still being pretty stubborn and she doesn't like how people are talking bad about her on Reddit now. Hoping we can reach a happy medium. **UPDATE:** I wanted to clear a few things up. First, my apologies about the spelling error. It is fixed. Second, when I say 'give permission' I should have worded it 'name the dog without my input.' Usually when naming a pet, it is in agreement of the two people. All I said to Nat was What are you gonna name her? And third, when I say 'begging for a dog,' I know she could get her own. I just don't like dogs and when she tried to convince me, I'd say no usually. Mutual agreement, again. I saw some people saying I was in the wrong because of the way I worded those parts of the story. So, I clarified a little. Anyways, we have since talked about the dog name and are still in a tiff. She is refusing to budge on her stance. I might just have to give in, as much as I don't like the idea",

        "selftext": "I recently had a baby with my boyfriend of 3 years, Nick. I work as a nurse with crazy hours and Nick previously worked in a warehouse. When I was pregnant, Nick expressed to me how he wanted to stay at home with the baby at least for the first couple of years as his dad was not in his life and he wants to soak up every moment of our child\u2019s life. We both agreed this would be best for our baby. I come from a conservative family and my parents were first not too pleased that we had a baby before marriage. My dad has made little hints here and there to Nick asking when is he \u201cgoing to make me an honest woman\u201d. When I told them Nick would stay at home with the baby, my dad took his glasses off, wiped his forehead and shook his head, but he did not say anything further. Recently at a family function, my cousin announced that she is pregnant! Everyone was giving her and her husband congratulations. My dad made a slide remark to them saying \u201ctalk to Nick here. He\u2019s an expert at the baby stuff\u201d. The comment was obviously meant to belittle Nick and my boyfriend just gave a nervous chuckle and nodded. Later in the day, our baby needed a diaper change, I was in the process of getting up to change him when my dad said to us \u201cwoah isn\u2019t that Nick\u2019s role? You do nothing while my daughter works. You can at least change a diaper while she is with her folks\u201d. I had had it. I told my dad to stop with his remarks. Nick is an EQUAL partner in our relationship and he is a wonderful dad who does most of the childcare. I told him just because he did fuck all of the child rearing for me and my siblings that does not mean all men need to be like him and he needs to get with the times because this isn\u2019t uncommon anymore. Things got awkward and mom quickly changed the subject to something else. My dad was pretty quiet for the rest of the night. After the event, my dad called me saying I disrespected him in front of our family and I was out of line. He said I insulted him as a father and to apologize. I told him I had nothing to apologize for and I was tired of him picking on Nick. My mom agrees with my father that I was too harsh on my dad.",

        "selftext": "I (28F) and my fianc\u00e9 (36M) are planning our wedding, and last night he accused me of being greedy and rude. Background: I come from a wealthy family and have worked hard to manage finances responsibly. My father has given each daughter $120K for their wedding. My sisters used all of it for their weddings, but I asked to use $70K for the wedding and $10K for a honeymoon, saving $40K to help with future children\u2019s expenses. My dad agreed to this plan, but only if I could make the wedding work with that budget. I didn\u2019t make this decision lightly. When I first got engaged five months ago, I considered using the full amount for a European wedding, but I realized I didn\u2019t want to prioritize that. A wedding is one day, and securing our future financial stability seemed more important. My fianc\u00e9 has been patient but has accused me of delaying the wedding due to indecisiveness, though I\u2019m just overwhelmed by spending so much on one day and managing everything else. Last night, I asked him to help review venues for a tour we\u2019re doing Monday. He rushed through options, and I started to cry from stress. I also wanted to vet the venues\u2019 prices before booking, but this frustrated him. He said I was rude for not wanting to use all the money for a wedding he would love, claiming that going over budget was fine because this was our most important day. He has always dreamed of a grand wedding with lots of guests. He criticized the venue I liked, an old library that only seats 180 and fits our budget. He said I was being rude by limiting my guest list to 60 people so he could invite 120 of his family. He also accused me of being \u201cgreedy\u201d for wanting to save the leftover money and said I looked like I was hoarding it. He argued that since we are financially well-off, I shouldn\u2019t worry about saving for future children. He also mentioned that our wedding planner had supposedly said I was being greedy, though he later admitted to making that up to show me how rude I was being. I thought I was being fiscally responsible by saving the extra money, but now I\u2019m questioning if I\u2019ve made the right decision. AITA?",

        "selftext": "My (M-late 30s) youngest sister (early 30s) is pregnant with her first child. The family is thrilled for her as she and her partner have been trying for a long time to get pregnant. When she announced it she mentioned that she was having a baby shower and my sister and I offered to help out where we can. For some reason, she took that as a \u201cmy brother said he would pay for the baby shower\u201d  and drafted a guest list of 120 people. I decided to text her one day and ask her what her budget was and I heard nothing for at least a day. My other sister and my mom mentioned that I had said to her that I would pay for the whole thing. That was never something I had offered to do. She never addressed it with me directly and said that she and her partner would pay for everything.  I took charge of creating the evite, registration site, driving an hour away to book the hall and put a deposit down, offered to do the centre pieces, pay for the stroller, driving back to the hall to add extra time to the reservation (because their archaic system doesn\u2019t allow people to book online), agree to pick up food on the day of, answer every inquiry from her guests who\u2019ve registered in the system. My husband offered to help out with the games for the shower. We saw my sister last week and she texted me on Monday saying, \u201cif he doesn\u2019t want to do the games, then tell me so I can give it to someone else.\u201d  I finally messaged back and said that I thought her message was a little harsh and if she was trying to imply something that she should just say it out loud. She then responded by saying \u201cfine. I\u2019m disappointed by how much work you\u2019ve put into this shower.\u201d That\u2019s when I lost it. I was objective and listed everything I had contributed so far. I also pointed out that I had never agreed to pay for a baby shower with 120 guests. I don\u2019t know much about them but I assumed they were intimate events in someone\u2019s home and not something the size of a wedding. I had less people at my own wedding. In addition to this, she complains about other people in her life to my mom and sister about how no one is pitching in. She asked my mom what she was contributing to the shower. My 70-year old retired mother was taken aback by that comment and offered to cook food for 120 people. She\u2019s been so ungrateful throughout this entire process and has since uninvited me to her shower and sarcastically said \u201cenjoy your 40th\u201d and removed me from my sibling group chat. ",

        "selftext": "Hey Reddit, thought I\u2019d get your opinion on this dispute I\u2019ve had with my neighbor over the last 3 months. My neighbor (87F) and I (28M) live in a rural area and access  our driveways through a wooded back road shared with 2 other houses. We live up north, and in the mornings it can stay dark until almost 8 am. My neighbor is older, nearly blind, and very stubborn. She has a \u201csupport dog\u201d (~4M) that helps her see, although he is not registered by any means. He is a friendly black lab and she has dressed him in a dog coat for warmth for as long as I can remember. The problem is, she lets the dog out in the morning to defecate and he has freedom to roam the shared road. Being a black dog and wearing a DARK BLACK COAT, he is almost impossible to see in the winter months. Between my neighbors and I, we have nearly hit this dog over 8 times in the past 2 months. I have talked to the neighbor about getting him a new coat or fixing bells to his collar or something, but she is attached to his coat for some reason and refuses to go with bells as they are too noisy and would be difficult for her to remove in her condition. Eventually, I took matters into my own hands after nearly smoking this poor pup when backing onto the shared road in my truck. I took the coat off of the dog and doused it in reflective spray paint. He sticks out like a sore thumb in the woods now, and my neighbors agreed it is much easier to see him. My neighbor had no idea for a few weeks until her step-nephew visited to help her with a plumbing issue and commented on the coat. She asked me about it, I owned up to it, and now she\u2019s furious - talking about vandalism and lawsuits. I admit I could\u2019ve got a separate reflective coat for him or used reflective tape or something, but I really think I helped more than I hurt the situation. AITA?",

        "selftext": "Last night my daughter was playing with legos before bedtime in the living room. This morning when our daughter woke up she walked onto the living room rug and suddenly began crying out hopping on one foot. It was still early morning and we all were a bit groggy. Our daughter hopped to her mom looking for comfort. Instead of consoling her, my wife kept insisting she wasn\u2019t hurt saying she just tripped on the rug. Our daughter kept saying she stepped on something but my wife kept disregarding it. I was quiet about the situation until this point where I stood up for our daughter and said I think she did step on something because she was playing with legos last night and the rug is thick. I looked at our daughter\u2019s foot and it was bleeding, so I cleaned it and put a bandaid on it. I then put on a funny video of people stepping on legos to cheer our kid up and show her it happens to other people too. After this my wife storms up stairs angrily. I wait a while to see if she comes back but she doesn\u2019t. I decide to put our daughter in the tub then go check on my wife. When I check on my wife, she is brooding and angry. I asked her what\u2019s wrong and she denied anything is wrong. I asked her why she stormed upstairs if nothing is the matter, she then proceeded to say we were ganging up on her. She said I provoked our daughter to go against her. I told her all I was doing was acknowledging our daughter was hurt when she was denying it. She then said I should have never come upstairs and make her angry. I told her she was acting childish and the situation was about helping our daughter, not about her. We began arguing, our daughter watching now. Noticing this, I shutdown the argument and took our daughter back to the bathroom to continue her bath and console her. I now feel like I\u2019m in the dog house for no good reason. I understand my wife may to feel like it\u2019s us against her and probably feels isolated, but I personally feel in this situation, she is being immature and self absorbed. AITA? INFO: Our daughter was using the potty when I went to check on my wife. She entered the tub when I was with her later. ",

        "selftext": "I\u2019m going to jump right in because the funeral is this Friday. My ex husband passed away last week in a car accident, very unexpectedly. The troopers came to my house (I\u2019m his emergency contact) to break the news. The first person I called was his father, and he flew out the next day with my exs sister. Before he flew out he asked me where we should have the service, in texas (where we live) or back in Maryland where our families and friends all still live.  I told him I felt like the service needed to be in Maryland because that was where everyone was and P (my exes father) agreed. He let me know the funeral home said they might be able to do a small viewing with just family and I agreed to doing that as long as I felt like he was in a condition he\u2019d be ok with.  I met my exes sister and his dad at the funeral home to go over paperwork and plan the viewing, he told me all the details for the funeral back home and we talked a bit about where my ex worked, his day to day life, his home, and the probate process. His father was taking care of the probate process and seemed defensive about some of his belongings, I really felt like focusing on my children was more important than arguing over small things in the home\u2026 all of that could wait so I backed off of helping with cleaning out him home and handed all of his insurance paperwork and other information I had that would be useful to them like contacts at his work and his electric login.  We had the viewing, both of our children said goodbye to their dad and it was very emotional. At the viewing I mentioned that a friend had paid for our tickets to fly home as I was quickly realizing how much everything was going to cost and I suddenly was without the financial help of their dad.. I was extremely thankful for their generosity.  After the viewing I didn\u2019t hear anything from his sister or dad, they didn\u2019t ask to see the kids or let me know what was going on with the process and I was actively trying to navigate the life insurance process while grieving my ex and helping my children with their feelings. The last few days have been a blur of crying and anger for all of us, we are so heartbroken to have lost him.  My exes sister and father flew out on Friday and around noon I got a call from his father telling me we were not welcome at the funeral and that my children and I would be a distraction to his (my exes father) families grieving.  I\u2019m shocked and hurt, I told him I had never heard anything so hateful and the conversation was over.  My exes father and sister have never visited texas, we\u2019ve lived here for 4 years. They were not close and had no idea where he worked, or even any recent photos of him. We were divorced but still good friends, and my ex was a devoted father. His children were his world.  AITA for not listening to his father and still taking them? The funeral is open to anyone, I can\u2019t imagine us being there among hundreds of other people will really be a problem.  Edit: for those asking his reason, he said \u201cwell I gave you a nice service here\u201d -we had a short viewing only and had previously agreed to the service being in Maryland so no, there was no service.  Also for clarity I am the beneficiary on the policies, my ex and I did his open enrollment together every year and we put each other as our beneficiaries to make it easier if anything like this ever did happen  I have a wrongful death attorney and he is helping me with the process but I will reach out to a probate attorney.  Thank you to everyone for the advice on SSI ",

She is asking me for $40 to \u201cborrow\u201d (she never pays anyone back) so she can get some groceries. I told her I\u2019m really strapped for cash right now myself as I just had to pay rent, bills, and take my dog to the emergency vet which in itself cost $487. I don\u2019t get paid again until next week. As a note, she does not work due to several health issues. Her husband works but doesn\u2019t make that much, yet somehow makes \u201ctoo much\u201d to qualify for food stamps.  I told my sister what I could do is go to the dollar tree and get some stuff to help get them by until he gets paid. She got upset and offended and said \u201cum\u2026 no thanks, I\u2019m good\u201d. I told her I watch this lady on TikTok who makes really good looking stuff with dollar tree items. She still said no especially because their meat looks nasty and her main meal she eats daily is meatloaf which I really can\u2019t afford to get ground beef as it\u2019s so expensive around here right now.  I told her well beggars can\u2019t be choosers. That\u2019s her option, either that or go hungry. She said she\u2019d rather go hungry and hung up on me.  So, AITA for offering to get my sister groceries from the dollar tree? I feel like I might be the asshole because, yes, I could give her the $40, but then I wouldn\u2019t be 100% certain that would actually go towards groceries (she smokes weed) and I\u2019ve learned the hard way to never give her cash. But now I feel like an asshole and a bad sister.  ETA: I think I gave the wrong impression with the \u201cmakes too much\u201d for food stamps comment. The quotations was because I think it\u2019s ridiculous the state denies people food stamps when they\u2019re clearly struggling. I\u2019ve been in that situation too, where I was only able to pay for rent and utilities and get my food from the food bank and still I didn\u2019t qualify. The system sucks! UPDATE: thank you everyone for your input. My dad, whom my sister refuses to have anything to do with (long story for another post), very generously decided to cashapp her $40 for groceries. And she did show me proof that she spent it on groceries (yes, to make meatloaf and mashed taters lol). Anyways, just wanted to share that. We decided family is family and it was just the right thing to do. ",

My wife has an incredibly strong work ethic (she's probably moreso defined as a workaholic). When I first met her, I was in trucking, making about 50k-70k/year. Since then I developed a niche for a speciality marketing field and became very good at it. All my friends encouraged me to go into business for myself with a marketing company. My wife was fully supportive of this, even after we discussed the financial difficulties we would have for the first year or so due to a l limited budget. I made sure she knew that some months, I may not get a check from the business (my salary is paid monthly).  Her family, however, were not. They accused me of neglecting my family, being lazy, not wanting to work, etc. They would constantly be bringing up the fact that I didn't have a job because I was always home (working remote). She would defend me, but they would ignore it and continue to call me lazy and a deadbeat for putting my daughter in daycare while I worked from home. I was still driving a truck part-time to have steady, reliable income but it was only half of what I was making on a good week.  In the last year however, I have grown my income from my business beyond what I was making in trucking, and have very little overhead. Since we cut costs back when I first started, we realized a lot of things we were paying for, we could do without or found other alternatives and we never really added those expenses back so it's like we have significantly more money now. I still drive a semi occasionally for a friend who owns his truck (mainly to keep my CDL active and stay knowledgable in the industry as a fallback). Her family has taken note, and they are constantly asking to go out to eat with us, hang out with us, etc then get mad when I never pay for the meals, the outing, the vacation, etc (aside from my part of the tab, obviously). Looking back, I understand why they never had money, they were living well beyond their means, but if it makes them happy then it is what it is.  I let my wife do whatever she wants with her money (which sometimes includes buying stuff for her family, which I support her doing with her money if that's how she wants to spend it) but I make sure that she knows I don't want a dime of my money going to her family since they were very unsupportive of what made us our money and would go as far as to talk down about me for doing what lead to our money.

        "selftext": "My baby shower is today and I was just told last night my aunt will be visiting for a few days from a different state and today is her birthday. Previous to last night I was unaware of her birthday or her even coming, then I was told my mother bought her A cake and plan on having everyone sing happy birthday at my shower. My issue is that there will be multiple strangers who have no clue who she is that will be forced to awkwardly sing to her, and they couldn\u2019t wait for another day. She is going to be here for a few days so Im confused why they couldn\u2019t simply take her to dinner after the event or a different day. When i expressed my concern my family implied I\u2019m being selfish and then proceeded to say I have no choice as I didn\u2019t pay for the shower. This is my first child and my family has made it clear this will be my one and only baby shower. So AITA for asking that this one event (not even the entire day just the event) to be about me only?  Edit: To everyone saying I should be happy to share this with my aunt because she came for me, I never said she came FOR me or for this shower. She just happens to be here and It would be a different situation if I were closer to this aunt but as previously mentioned im distant enough to have not even known it was her birthday. Also when this tia was originally told about my pregnancy she was insanely negative and criticizing telling me to possibly abort.  ",

        "selftext": "I (32F) live in NYC. I recently moved into a small building, three stories, 6 apartments in total. My apartment is a ground floor unit. From move in a neighbor (40F and 40M) has been storing their large stroller in front of my front door, which poses problems every time I have to come and go from my apartment. It is also against fire code and explicitly forbidden in the building's leases. The stroller is there every day, unless their kid (3M) decides he doesn't want to walk. One day when I heard them leaving it there, I introduced myself and politely said them leaving their stroller there was causing me issues and it is against the city's fire code and asked them to no longer keep their stroller in front of my front door. The 40F neighbor gave me excuses that they live on the third floor, but the 40M neighbor straight up raised his voice at me, while I was holding my infant daughter. The woman said as a compromise she'd fold the stroller when leaving it front of my door. As time went on, the stroller was never folded up and continued to block my door. As it is against fire code, and explicitly forbidden in the lease, I decided to reach out to property management for help resolving this issue. I just want to be able to safely come and go from my apartment.  The day the property management enforced this on these neighbors, the 40F neighbor rang my doorbell, and proceeded to refuse to speak to me and called her mother. Her mother then berated me on speaker phone and said I should have spoken to them first, ignoring me when I said I did. She then kind of threatened me saying I complained about the wrong people. I was stunned and couldn't believe this was happening. All I could muster was insisting it is against fire code and no one gets to break fire code.  I am baffled by this behavior. I found it a bizarre confrontation and I didn't know adults could act this way. I've never had issues with neighbors before.  I have a child younger than their's and empathize with their situation, but their kid is massive and able to walk. They could just have an umbrella stroller, like I do. I just wanted access to my front door. AITA? tl;dr neighbor in small apartment building breaks fire code and blocks my front door and ignores polite personal request to stop. I take it up with building management. The neighbor initiated bizarre confrontation with her mother on speaker phone, making vague threats. AITA?  EDIT: I appreciate the outside perspective. I didn't think I was TA, but I do have hardcore people pleasing tendencies and it was very clear my actions hurt people's feelings, and it gave me self doubt.  The reason I engaged with the mother on the phone at all is bizarre too, it's all just too weird and I'm reeling a little lol. The 40F neighbor has an unusual way of speaking, I haven't been able to work out if it is an accent or what. When she put the mother on speaker phone I had a sinking thought that maybe the 40F neighbor is deaf and needs someone to talk for her and I felt bad that maybe I'd made a deaf person feel victimized when they can't speak up for themselves???? But like she clearly wasn't deaf, her mother was just on speaker phone with no video and she had zero issues following the conversation. Apart from this is incident and the other shitty neighbor stuff this woman and her man have pulled, they seem like normal functional adults. The man does not have an unusual way of speaking. I don't think her unusual way of speaking is really a factor in whether I'm TA, and I have been so eager to be polite and respectful. It became clear very quickly the phone call wasn't really about helping in communication, but just messy people expressing their anger as much as possible. But yeah, that's why I let the phone call happen. Messy. ",

        "selftext": "I (24F) and my sister (30F) inherited a very nice apartment from our parents in SoHo. Their will sort of just said it\u2019s up to us how we split it up. We sort of decided that because it\u2019s in the family trust just to both use it how we saw fit. Two years ago, my sister got a job in Manhattan and moved there with her family (two kids and husband). Now, I am going to grad school in the city and want to live there as well (it\u2019s basically free and which is super helpful with student loans).  My sister moved into the master bedroom and she gave her two kids her old bedroom and the guest room. The master bedroom and the guest room both have their own bathrooms. My old bedroom from when we stayed there with our parents is pretty small but I loved it at the time because it was never our primary residence.  Now, I want to live in the guest room with the restroom as I am now an adult and have my niece move to my old room. My sister is saying it\u2019s unfair to move my 8 year old niece out but I don\u2019t think so because it\u2019s my apartment just as much as it\u2019s her and she already moved to the master ( which even though it\u2019s much nicer I have no issues with).  On a side note, I also requested my father\u2019s old office, which her husband uses while she uses my mom\u2019s. My mom\u2019s has two desks and is objectively the most beautiful room in the whole apartment. As a student probably going to have to work a couple separate jobs to pay for my education, it would be really nice to have a desk to do HW on. My brother in law is also a stay at home dad and mainly uses the office for gaming.  AITA for wanting to use our apartment like this? Edit: thank you all for the help. just to answer some of your questions there was no real agreement on how to split it up because my parents died pretty suddenly and the will hadn\u2019t been edited in a while. as for property taxes and stuff my parents trust covers it ( my sister mainly handles that stuff). some people asked about the loans and stuff but basically when i turn 25 in 11 months i get access to some of the cash assets and should be able to pay off everything so it\u2019s not that big a deal. I also wouldn\u2019t want to sell the apartment if possible because my mother spent so much time on it and i miss her a lot and you can see her touch in all the furniture and stuff. ",

My sister (32) has 3 girls. 13, 9, and 7. I love them very much but I've never been the aunt that wants them to spend the night or spend time more than a couple hours with them. They stress me out, all kids do lol. My sister is an addict and my nieces dad is currently in prison. Their grandma, who is also my mother but I have no contact with, has guardianship of them. That story we'll save for another post. My sister, who comes in and out of the girls lives, has had nothing to do with me. Once is awhile she'll reach out and say hi, but that's more like 2 times a year. Even though I reach out once a week. Anyways long story short it's a very toxic family environment and me and my husband just stick to ourselves. Recently, the place they have all been living at has been sold and they were told in November they have until January 31 to be out. So today 1/23 they had my 13 year old niece call me and tell me their not going to have anywhere to live if I don't take them in. Yes, they had the 13 year call me and say that. Idk what to do. I don't want to change up mine and my husband's life. I love they way our life is. I'm so mentally drained. I don't want the responsibility and don't feel like it's mine but I also feel guilty. I've been doing this for years, dealing with others messes. Both my parents were addicts and it's the same toxic cycle with my sister. ",

        "selftext": "I feel so awful about this, but my husband has a habit of forgetting/ignoring things I say. I WFH and am always there to unlock the front door for my husband when he gets back from work, so the couple of times I\u2019ve needed the car, I get very annoyed that he\u2019s taken the house keys attached to the car keys with him. This has happened a few times, he\u2019ll lock all the house doors in the morning and go off to work with the car keys so I can neither leave the house nor drive anywhere.  So I made sure we have two sets of keys and the second pair must always be on the console table for emergencies. The problem is my husband started keeping the emergency keys in his work bag and if he took the car anywhere, I was again locked in the house. This recently happened again when my family was coming over and they stood at a locked door while I searched the house for his work bag.  Today I woke up very unwell and wanted to run to the chemist between meetings and pick up a book I had on hold at the library, when once again, my husband has taken the car keys. What made me so angry was that I\u2019ve told him this a million times and I could have had a massive emergency. He was so calm and apologetic on the phone and but that just made me angrier. I\u2019m sick of him never listening.   So I lost it and demanded he come home immediately and drop the keys back because I need to go to the chemist. He started apologising and saying he has a meeting at work about to start, but I told him this is not a discussion and I expect him back home right now because I\u2019m sick of repeating myself. He said he\u2019s on his way back but I feel so awful for stressing him out while he\u2019s at work and making him take a 40 minute journey back. But I\u2019m also so desperate to be heard the first damn time, exactly how I listen and respect his wishes. Am I an asshole? ",

His frugality has served him well, he has a beautiful home, savings, he's been retired for over 10 years, multiple rental properties etc.. Recently my daughter (15) and I drove up from Phoenix to visit him over the weekend. Typically my Dad cooks breakfast every morning, on this particular morning, he didn't feel like it and told us we were going out to breakfast. This is a little unusual since he **does not like to eat out due to the expense**. He took us to a local diner type place and we all ordered. My daughter ordered the chicken fried steak. I heard my Dad mumble something like ..the things you order. I thought he was just referring maybe to the portion size since my daughter is so small, but, it didn't seem like a big deal at the moment. We all ate, my daughter ate all of her food, we both said thank you before and after our meal and were very appreciative. Later on that day while I was cleaning out his refrigerator, my Dad says I can't stand it anymore! gets out of his recliner and comes into the kitchen with us. He then goes into how our lack of manners needs addressing. He has this rule of etiquette that says that if someone invites you to a meal out, you should never order anything more expensive than the person that's paying. I think it's rude to put that responsibility on a guest. Of course moderation in all things, for instance , I think it's rude if I took someone out to dinner and they order a bunch of drinks for themselves or an outrageously priced meal but, this was chicken fried steak at a diner, not a magnum of champagne.     I was surprised when he brought it up. My daughter had told me that he'd mentioned it to her   whie visiting him at his winter place a few years ago, and I told her to let me know if it happened again and I'd talk to him about it. I got extremely uncomfortable with the conversation because I don't want to be disrespectful to anyone in their own home. I was try to be as careful as I could be while still defending my daughter. I reminded him that if he had a reprimand for her to let me know, and I'll handle it. However, we will respect his rule when we are with him and apologized for any disrespect he felt as that was definitely not our intention. However, no, that's not etiquette that we (my ex-husband and I) are going to impart on her. He seemed pretty miffed about it, saying that it's a normal rule of etiquette and that we would feel the same way if it happened to us (we would absolutely NOT feel put out if a guest ordered chicken fried steak, lol).      And for context, my daughter is a fantastic person. She's kind and respectful, she still goes and visits her grandparents. She's patient with his stories and helps him, they cook together, all kinds of nice things. She's a delight and does not need to be taught a lesson.       I'm going back to my Dad's house this weekend, if it comes up again am I the asshole here?",

        "selftext": "I'm pissed over this so please tell me if this makes no sense. I, (22F) have been with my incredible girlfriend, Layne (22F) for just over a year now. I introduced her to all my friends about four months in and since then she's been hanging out with us (seven including me) regularly. So, I have a friend, Freya (23F), who is kind of nosy. For a couple weeks, Layne has been out of town (before anyone asks, she didn't want me to come. I offered but she said she just needed to do this alone) for family issues I won't spill here, and Freya has been nagging me like crazy about it. Me and my friends all go to the same university, and we hangout pretty much everyday, so I can't avoid her.  First, I thought it started with honest concern. I told her what I said before, that she's out of town for some family stuff. Plain and simple. Subtly trying to get the idea across that it's none of her fucking business. She accepted that for all of one day. She then amped it up to pressing about exactly *what* the family thing is. I just kept shutting her down, calmly asking her to drop it, saying that Layne doesn't want her stuff being aired out like that (which she had explicitly told me). But she just wouldn't take no for an answer. Just kept insisting that it was fine if she knew, and I would just ignore her. Last night was my last straw. We were hanging out at a local bar when Layne called me. I told my friends I'd be back in a bit and went outside to take it. Layne was pretty upset, so I told her I'd get a cab and go home so I could fully focus on her. I quickly went back into the bar to tell my friends I had to go, mind you, I still had Layne on the line because I was only anticipating for it to take a minute. I just said something like Hey guys, but I gotta go, see you later, and pointed at the ongoing call. Freya, who was dead sober, decided it was a great idea to try to grab my phone from my hand, yelling questions at Layne. I backed up and held the phone to my chest, completely surprised because seriously what the fuck? I yelled at her to back off and told her my girlfriend's personal stuff was none of her business. She spluttered for a second, everyone else just staring at us bewildered before I just left. I talked to Layne on the way home and told her what happened, but said it was no big deal rn and refocused the conversation on what she needed to talk about. By the time I got home I had turned my phone on do not disturb and was facetiming Layne, so I didn't see the messages from my friends until today. Freya was pissed that I yelled at her, and two of our other friends, Toby (23M), and Clay (22M) shared the same sentiment of me embarrassing Freya by getting so angry at her when she was just worried about Layne. The rest of my friends were asking me if I was okay and siding with me. I just wanna know, despite my friends and Layne telling me Freya was totally weird for it, did I overreact? I'm starting to feel a bit guilty, I never *ever* yell like that.",

I, for example, mow the lawn, and do laundry and dishes, and she meal plans, cooks, and picks up/drops off the kids. Lately, this has all changed because she has become addicted to a game called Dress to Impress on Roblox. If you aren't familiar, it's a game where you have to dress your character in a themed outfit before the time runs out, and the other players rate it from 1 to 5 stars.     It started off harmless, just a fun thing she would do during downtime before bed, but recently she has missed crucial appointments and chores because of this game. I tried to be understanding and gently remind her to do her tasks but she would always say she forgot or got distracted.     The big argument happened last night when she forgot to pick up our 9 year old son from basketball practice, which ended at 6:00. I hadn't gotten home yet as I had to work late, and our son doesn't have a phone, so I had no way of knowing the situation. I eventually got home around 7:00 and realized he was not in his room. I looked around further and saw that he was nowhere to be found. I walked into our bedroom, confused, to ask my wife where he was and found her on her iPad playing the game as always. When I asked her where our son was her eyes grew wide and I knew what happened without her having to say. I immediately got back into my car and went to pick him up, luckily, his coach had stayed after to make sure he was picked up safe and I apologized profusely. Apparently, he had been calling and texting my wife, who was the emergency contact, and she didn't even notice.     When we got home I immediately blew up at her. How could she be so addicted to a kids game that she completely forgot our son? Now, she's telling me it was a one time thing and that I'm an asshole for getting angry. I don't know what to think, I do kind of understand her side of the story as it has only happened one time, but she has to be a responsible parent. She can't just completely forget about our child who has no way to get home on his own! So, AITA?",

I\u2019m going to contact the police tomorrow and make a report as well as get a runner and a cheap camera as soon as I get paid. I\u2019ll update if anything changes, but I hope you all have a fantastic night and thank you for the advice.   I (30f) have 4 dogs, but the one this story is about is a 4f rottie named Bella. A few months ago new renters moved next door, and things have been unpleasant to say the least. The neighbors are always screaming and fighting late into the night and the men in the home have a habit of always trying to talk to, or just watch, me when I'm outside. This is not done in a friendly way, and it has made me feel very uncomfortable. I\u2019m a single female living alone, and our police force isn\u2019t the best so I just keep my head down hoping they\u2019ll move out soon. The other night, around 11pm, I was outside with my dogs in the backyard.  My neighbors have a chain fence, but I have no fence along my property except for the part that separates their property from mine. One of my dogs is on leash, but the other three are completely trained off leash and do not leave the yard. I know some people may not agree with that, but I live in the countryside, and also my dogs have NEVER run off.  One of the women who lives next door, for some reason, decided to enter my yard because she wanted to \u201cjust play with my puppies\u201d. Bella growled and walked closer to me and I asked the woman to please leave but she just kept telling me it was fine and ignored what I was saying. One of the men decided to join her and they came more onto my property, which then led to Bella barking and after a few moments of them continuing she chased after them. She stopped running the second she hit the property line and went inside with me immediately after.  Now these neighbors keep making comments about not feeling safe with their kids, and how I should have called my dog back because they weren\u2019t a threat. I don\u2019t feel like I did anything wrong but I also don\u2019t want the area to think that my dogs are dangerous, especially with the stigma against rotties. I also don\u2019t want to stir up unnecessary drama when it\u2019s already difficult living next to these people. AITA?",

        "selftext": "I (28M) and my wife (29F) are expecting our first baby in March and are very excited, but there have been some complications. My wife has been struggling with constant nausea and pain, which has led her to be basically bed ridden the past few months. Her nausea has been a bit better lately, so my mom and sister decided to throw us a baby shower (I know that dad isn\u2019t typically invited, but that\u2019s just how my family does it.) Well, my MIL is not happy about any of it. She is upset that my family is throwing the shower (even though she never offered to help) and upset that men were invited. That, I could see from her point of view and put aside for the sake of reducing drama. What I couldn\u2019t forgive was her comments toward my wife the second she came through the door. She claimed that my wife \u201cwasn\u2019t really that sick\u201d and was \u201cjust doing it to get out of work\u201d when, in reality, my wife was working online literally from the bathroom in between vomiting. The kicker was when my sweet sister tried to lighten the mood saying \u201cwell, at least (wife) is feeling better now\u201d and MIL said \u201cI bet she\u2019s just her to get our money and attention, then not show her face for another month.\u201d I was LIVID. I told her she needed to shut up or leave, because this day was about supporting my wife and our baby, so she needed to do that. That ticked her off so she screamed at my wife and I for being ungrateful until my wife cried, so I told her to \u201cjust f**k off already.\u201d She finally listened and left, any the rest of the party went somewhat smoothly. However, some family members said I should have just ignored her, and wife doesn\u2019t want to talk about it. So, was I in the wrong?",

        "selftext": "So my (24f) mom is living with me since she got divorced a decade ago and has been struggling to manage things on her own since then. She lost her job in the summer and originally was looking a bunch for jobs but now isn\u2019t really doing that. But she met someone working for my apartment recently and they were talking a little bit for a few months. Now this talking was literally just seeing each other outside and chatting for a minute before going about their way.  Well she had him over for the first time on Christmas Eve 2024. We were find with that but requested he please not stay overnight since he\u2019s a stranger to us. She refused to kick him out and he stayed in our apartment the whole night. After that I tried to discuss with her some boundaries which I thought were reasonable. The only boundary I had was for him not to stay overnight until me and my sister got to know him better. She was mad at us for that and frequently argued with us and tried to plead with us but respected it.  But one night it was weird because she went to bed at 10pm then at 11 comes to get us saying he texted her wanting to come over and would we let him. We gently stated our boundary again and she said that she\u2019d already told him he could stay overnight. That hurt me a little but she ended up telling him to go back home. She was pissed though since he lives a few hours away and only comes to the apartment to work. But he could come over a couple nights a week and they\u2019d sleep together then he\u2019d leave before it got too late.  And some of why me and my sister requested this boundary is because our dad was notorious for having random people over when we\u2019d come for visitation as teenagers and not warning us beforehand.  And it\u2019s also weird because not once have they gone on a traditional date. They never go place together and my mom has no interest in it. It\u2019s only sex in her room a couple nights a week. And she\u2019s also been drinking a lot more since meeting him which concerns me because she\u2019s already jobless.  Final part of the story is that she says he just broke up with her because me and my sister wouldn\u2019t let him stay overnight. I tried to tell my mom we didn\u2019t mean never and just wanted to get to know him before a stranger sleeps in our apartment. I also think it\u2019s weird that he would rather not be with her than wait a little bit to sleep with her overnight. And keep in mind that they were seeing each other multiple times per week, just not overnight. My mom is pissed at me and begging me to let him stay overnight so she can get him back and giving me the whole spiel about how she has always taken care of us and this is how we repay her. Saying don\u2019t you care about my mental health and that he\u2019s the only thing that makes her happy.  This has been weighing on me for weeks so I really need to know\u2014 AITA for upholding my boundary?  ETA: adding a new section for where the guy lives to make it more clear since I shouldn\u2019t have buried it in long paragraphs. I don\u2019t want to reveal too much but he lives 3 hours away and his job involved traveling so he\u2019s down where we are on weekdays and doesn\u2019t have a permanent place up here.  ETA again: sorry guys I typed this all up in an emotional rush and probably didn\u2019t explain myself the best. Yeah of course we lived with my mom when I was 14 until college when I started paying most of the rent cause my mom was struggling. But me and my sister moved for a work opportunity a few years ago and our mom came with us since she didn\u2019t have much at our old place and couldn\u2019t pay rent alone so that\u2019s why we live together now. When the divorce happened we lost the house and have been living in apartments and people\u2019s basements since.  ",

        "selftext": "My (19f) friends and I all decided to go on a ski trip for a 12 days over winter break. We found a place to stay and all in all it was around $600 per person for the rental and we decided it was just easiest to have one person (me) put all the money upfront and just everyone pay me back before the actual trip, which everyone did. In my friend group we have a girl let\u2019s call Sarah. Sarah comes from a comfortable family and was even one of the people who suggested the trip and was one of the leading forces to finding the Air Bnb. Literally in the weeks leading up to the trip we were all fine, sending outfit ideas, restaurants to books etc. the Tuesday before we left (Saturday) Sarah starts sending texts to the gc like \u201cguys Jacob\u2019s (boyfriend) family is going to xxxxx next week\u201d basically sending us a LOT of details about where his family is going for winter vacation that we didn\u2019t really need to know. Then on Thursday (again we leave on Saturday) she texts the gc saying how she couldn\u2019t go because she had a family emergency, said her grandma had gotten admitted to the hospital . We were obviously bummed but family comes first and I told her that I would send her the money back that she sent towards the rental. We go on the trip and everything is ok until one of my friends who has Sarah\u2019s location on Life360 (roommates) sees that she\u2019s in a beach town and we put 2 and 2 together. We spend that night pissed and we call her out the next day where she admits everything. She had been last minute invited on her boyfriend\u2019s vacation and decided that she wanted to go to that instead but didn\u2019t know how to tell us. We were all obviously hurt and upset that she would choose a boy over us but at the end of the day she\u2019s a 19 year old girl so I guess it\u2019s just immaturity. The part that I\u2019m wondering if I\u2019m the asshole with is that after finding out that she voluntarily pulled out of the trip, I had told her I wouldn\u2019t be refunding her the $600 she had sent me for the rental. She pulled out so last minute that we couldn\u2019t find anything cheaper and I said I was ok just wasting that money because again I thought she was having a family emergency. After finding out that she wouldn\u2019t be getting that back she went insane and started calling me a bad friend and everything. My parents think I should send it back to her but I don\u2019t see why I should, she pulled out because of her boyfriend and expected us to all just absorb the costs?? ",

She mentioned that she put one answer for a certain question, but I had gotten a different answer and was almost positive that my answer was right based on the work I did during the quiz. A group of friends in the class also got the same \u201cincorrect\u201d answer, so we went to the teacher to ask her to explain. After working through it with us the teacher determined that her original answer in the key was incorrect, and she decided that she would re-grade everyone\u2019s quiz - meaning Vivian would get a 95 instead of a 100 and my grade would be raised to correct for the error. I thought that was the end of it, but now Vivian is repeating this story to everyone she can, blaming me for \u201ctaking her hundred away\u201d because I \u201cwanted a perfect score so badly.\u201d She\u2019s also placing the blame entirely on me even though three other people also raised the same concern to the teacher with me.

        "selftext": "tw loss of a parent I (42F) have been married to my husband (48F) for 12 years, together for 15. We both work full time, no kids. My husband is ND and extremely successful in his career, but struggles with day-to-day functioning. He has a lot of dietary restrictions and over the years I was happy to work around those--mostly we now eat homemade salad and baked chicken, in various forms. Unfortunately, this resulted in a situation where I do ALL the cooking. Any attempts to cook for me have lasted about one night before he is overwhelmed and frazzled and so I just go back to cooking as it's what I have always done. I also pay all the bills, manage the household, take care of the dogs, do the laundry, clean the house, and work my own jobs. I am an academic and work at two schools. Over the last five years, my husband has been sick with various ailments, starting with atypical long covid, and then this year accelerating into an allergy to wood dust, intolerance to edibles, allergy to a paint I used on the kitchen cabinets, a reaction to our gas stove, and now (and this is the problem) an inability to tolerate chicken being baked in a tiny electric toaster oven as I'm not allowed to use gas anymore. He will not eat other meats or pasta. I cannot use the stovetop as causes oil to splatter and it bothers him. He has pursued no medical solution aside from an inhaler from his PCP. His symptoms are mysterious and variable. He has not seen an allergist or rheumatologist in spite of my pleading. In the middle of all of this, I was the primary caretake for my father, who died slowly and brutally. He died in my arms on 12/21/24 after 10 months of illness, during which time I became his medical and financial power of attorney. He died hardly more than two weeks ago. For those of you that know, you know. For those of you that do not know, I don't want you to know. I am now the primary caretaker for my mother. Since the death, my husband's health issues about me cooking have arisen and have become the focal point of a tremendous amount of friction in our marriage and home life. I know I am not helping; I am exhausted, I am traumatized by the death, I am lost, I am angry at not being able to cook in my own home unless I break my work day to do so, so that the chicken offgassing has passed by the time he returns home from work. And even then it causes so much stress, which compounds my desperate sadness. It seems silly to grieve the loss of the ability to cook as I did, but I do. This morning, finally, I realized that perhaps I needed to remove myself from this whole emotional food-centered loop and told my husband he can cook and shop for himself and I will cook and shop for myself and the dogs. He was not happy about this at all. I feel like a miserable failure of a wife. But I am drowning. I had to put some sort of boundary down so that I could protect and nourish myself in this hard time. AITA for longer wanting to cook in this impossible environment? ETA: thank you, thank you all so much. You have  made such a difference. I am reading and processing all you\u2019re saying and will reply to everything.",

        "selftext": "So let me start off with I'm pretty bad at checking the details on my bank statements, but recently something wasn't right. So I went through every single one for the past year, and there were over 100 charges from PlayStation. I only had 4 purchases on my 2 PS accounts in a single year, so I panicked as someone had my cc info. In all, the total charges were around 1500. I contacted both of my siblings who's kids also have accounts and asked nicely if their kids may have purchased anything using my bank account before i make a dispute. Both said no, so I went ahead and called both PS and my bank. The bank was able to chargeback past few months and rest is under investigation. Well a few days later I get a frantic call from my teenage nephew who says his PS account was perma banned. I asked him if he was sure he didn't buy anything with a cc after I gave him a several hundred dollars PS giftcard for his birthday this summer to spend on stuff, he again denied. So I have his email logins and sure enough, it was purchases he made to his account. All the stuff he plays. Then he starts to say maybe he bought a few items here and there.  Now my sister is pissed at me. She says I must have added my cc info to buy him something at some point in time, and it was all my fault he was making purchases from my card. If it were her cc, she'd get an alert. Never that he may have taken my cc info, no. She doesn't want him to lose his account, and said she'll call PS to pay for it all. She said he always asks and she gets alerts and doesn't understand that I didn't, so I shouldn't blame him. I said well he knew he was spending someone else's money, so why is it my fault? And that he stopped asking her for permission to make purchases because no one stopped him. After that she said I was blaming her kid for everything. So AITA here? ##Edit:  Info:He is almost 15.I'm unsure of how he got my payment info. ##Update! After an intense argument, she was still denying he made the charges at all. I was finally able to show her each and every transaction (before I had only explained and she didn't believe me). After seeing the evidence, he finally fessed up. He claimed he thought it was HER card \ud83e\udd2a. She will be paying me for all the money he used on my account and will not be getting the PS5 back, until he works to pay it off. Even then she may not let him have it. He insists that he will be paying us both double for our troubles. But the real damage done here is the trust I have in both of them.",

        "selftext": "I (25f) and my boyfriend (28m) have been together for 3 years and have been living together with my twins (3m) for 2 years. Me and their father (26m) have never been together and he hadn\u2019t wanted to be a part of their life until they were a year old. We have a custody agreement that they go every other weekend with him on Saturday with me dropping them off and picking them up but last weekend my boyfriend had to pick them up because I had a work trip. For context, the twins don\u2019t know life without my boyfriend we have been together since I found out I was pregnant and he was there for all the ultrasounds and birth classes he sat and read all the books with me and was there for the labor. He loves them like his own and in my eyes they\u2019re as much his kids as mine he was up all the late nights taking care of not only me but them too. Back to it, he was picking up the kids for me (this is not the first time), and they had called him daddy to get his attention while he was talking to my ex. He said that my ex had \ufffcseemed to be okay with it and he left to take them home but while I was at the airport my ex called me screaming saying how undermining and disrespectful it was that the twins called him daddy while and they wouldn\u2019t speak at his house which I had not known about considering that the twins don\u2019t stop talking at my house until they fall asleep but then he started complaining about custody which was originally his idea because he was working a lot and saying that it was my fault because my boyfriend is spending more time with them and that he doesn\u2019t have enough time to bond with them. He then started on how it was \u201cnot right\u201d that the twins were so comfortable with my boyfriend but his fianc\u00e9 couldn\u2019t hug the twins without bribing them with something, I ended up hanging up on him because my plane was boarding and he was just screaming at me. Later when I got home his fianc\u00e9 started calling and texting me which I ignored because she\u2019s been known to have a terrible attitude toward me even when I\u2019m just picking up the twins, I talked with my boyfriend to see what we should do about the twins calling him daddy and he said that it\u2019s up to me and he loves it but would understand if I told them to stop but I don\u2019t know I love that my twins call him dad I feel like he\u2019s earned it but I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m being a dick because my ex is in their life and he is their father. (Update)I would like to thank you all for the support and advice that you have sent us, I sat down with my boyfriend and we read through the comments when the twins were napping and were especially grateful for the comments from people who were and are in a similar situation because it give some insight on how to handle this all. There are a few things I would like to share now that we are planning on doing/ talking about. First one of the biggest things I saw in the comments was the custody, we don\u2019t have a written legal agreement on the matter but my boyfriend is going to be connecting one of his friends who is married to a family lawyer to see if she can help and draw up an agreement. Secondly, I saw a lot of comments on the mental manipulation that may be happening to the twins I have been in therapy since I was twelve because of depression and anxiety with a family history of mental illness like bipolar so therapy has always been a thing that I wanted my kids to be in when I felt would be most beneficial and I definitely didn\u2019t want them to start this young but \ufffcthe comments on what meant be happening at my ex\u2019s house I think me and my boyfriend will start looking at therapist together for the twins. I haven\u2019t talked to my ex yet but I had to block him earlier today because he was repeatedly repeatedly calling and texting me while at work.\ufffc I\u2019ve taken him off of the pickup list at their daycare and I\u2019m going to be texting him tomorrow because I don\u2019t feel like them going over there is the best thing for the twins right now so we\u2019re planning on going out of the city to stay with my bf\u2019s parents at their house. That\u2019s all I have for today but I will try to keep you guys updated on what\u2019s happening, thank you again for all the love and support.",

        "selftext": "I (26 F) divorced my ex husband (26 M) about four years ago. We share 2 children, a son and a daughter. During our divorce hearing we were able to work out custody, visitation and child support arrangements. He agreed to give me full custody of the kids and he would pay child support. After the divorce he decided to up and move to Nashville to chase his \u201cmusic career\u201d that never existed. He managed to work his way up to almost $6,000 behind on his child support, went 7 months without a phone call or visit and when he moved back I let him start seeing the kids as soon as he asked (2 weeks after he arrived in our state). I try to always remind myself that my relationship with him is not the kids relationship with him. Anyway fast forward to now, his grandfather has been paying his child support monthly (according to his grandmother and aunt) so that he doesn\u2019t lose his license or go to jail. He went out and got a job about 2 months ago and the lady assigned to our case is great at her job so even though he did not report his job, she knew he was working. His grandfather pays the monthly amount on the last day of every month, so I received December\u2019s amount on December 31st. On January 3rd I received another payment to that account and approximately 30 minutes after the notification my children\u2019s father starts calling me asking for the money back because it was a mistake payment. I simply explained that I couldn\u2019t give the money back but if he reached out to child support I would be okay with them giving it back. The conversation continues until he admits that they have started garnishing his wages. He proceeds to tell me that they took his entire paycheck, he can\u2019t buy lunch, or put gas in his car. He wants me to \u201cgive $200 back\u201d and he will \u201callow me to keep the extra $82\u201d. I simply stated that I didn\u2019t think it was fair to give the money back when they had credited his account for paying that amount. I also informed him that I do not use that card for personal reasons and all of the money is used on the kids wants and needs. Both of my kids birthdays are in January, i had already told the kids that we will go to a waterpark for a weekend so if I keep the money that\u2019s what it will be used on. He started calling me names and telling me that I\u2019m impossible and never happy. So am I the asshole for not giving my ex husband lunch money because he claims they took his whole check? ",

        "selftext": "I (36F) am a new manager at my office. I started about 4 months ago, and while I\u2019ve been trying to get to know my team, I still don\u2019t have all the dynamics figured out. One of my team members recently asked me to buy Girl Scout cookies from his daughter and I said I couldn\u2019t because I have celiac disease which makes me allergic to the cookies. He suggested I purchase a box and give it to a friend or family member because it would mean a lot to him and his kid. The conversation continued back and forth but we didn't argue so I thought everything was fine between us. Then I find out that he\u2019s been talking behind my back about how bad of a manager I am because I\u2019m \u201cstubborn and stingy\u201d. Apparently their previous manager used to buy a lot of cookies so I look mean in comparison. I\u2019m not close enough with my other coworkers (besides the one who told me about the gossip) to talk to them about this, but I get the impression they\u2019re on his side because one of them made a big show of leaving a plate of cookies they\u2019d bought from him in the breakroom telling everyone to help themselves and then saying directly to me, \u201cthis flavor is gluten free so feel to eat some!\u201d. I wanted to keep the peace so I just said thanks, but I didn\u2019t eat any because I\u2019m pretty strict about cross contamination with gluten. I worry that I made things worse by not eating them, but at the same time I don\u2019t think I\u2019m obliged to support his cause. My friends say I should just buy a box this time and if he does it again then I can stand my ground but it\u2019s not really about the cookies now. It\u2019s about him trying to shame me into doing what he wants. AITA for not buying cookies from him?   Edit 1: Thank you everyone for weighing in! I'm surprised by how many people have been affected by people selling things in their office. I definitely won't be buying his cookies and I'm going to sit down with him to discuss the bad-mouthing. I think I'll wait to escalate this to HR because I'm getting the sense that he wouldn't respond well. It's definitely tough as a new manager and woman so I'm determined to do this right! ",

        "selftext": "Hey Reddit, I\u2019m a 15 year old guy, and this week has been one of the hardest of my life. My dog, Romeo, passed away unexpectedly a few days ago. He wasn\u2019t just a dog, a lot of people get wgat i mean,he was my best friend, and the closest thing to me in since I was 3. got me. I didn\u2019t think it would hit me this hard, but it did. Now, here\u2019s the thing,my older brother (20M) is the stereotypical \u201ctough guy.\u201d , super popular, full of confidence, high school musical typa shit. But he also has a bad habit of dismissing anything that doesn\u2019t fit into his worldview. We\u2019ve never been THAT close,he thinks I\u2019m too sensitive, and I think he\u2019s a bit of an ass,but I genuinely thought he\u2019d understand how much romeo meant to me. I mean, even if he didn\u2019t care about romeo, he could have at least respected that I did, right? You guessed it,he didnt\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb Yesterday, I was sitting in the living room, looking through old photos of romeo on my phone and tbh i was crying. I thought I was alone. Then my brother walked in, took one look at me, and started laughing menacingly( literally it sounded like doflamingo from one piece). He said things like: you really cryin' over a dog? and man up, it's just an animal. I tried to ignore him at first and asked him to stop, but that just seemed to make him more of an asshole. He kept going, saying things like,  Whats next? you gonna hold a funeral for him? and even pretended to cry in a mocking way. I don\u2019t know what changed in me, but I snapped. I was hurt, angry, and just so fed up with how shitty he was being. I remembered that not long ago, his girlfriend of two years had broken up with him. Ever since, he\u2019s been moping around the house, blasting sad breakup songs, and talking to anyone who\u2019ll listen about how \u201cheartbroken\u201d he is. So I looked him dead in the eye and said, at least my 'just an animal loved me, your girl clearly didnt love you the way she cheated on you, at least my dog died loving me, your girl is still alive and didnt love you He froze, completely silent. Then his face went red, and he stormed out of the room without saying a word. Fast forward to later, my parents heard about what happened (thanks to him, ofc) and told me I was out of line. They said I went too far and that I should apologize because what I said was cruel. But here\u2019s the thing,I don\u2019t feel like I owe him an apology. He mocked me while I was grieving, dismissed my feelings, and only stopped when I hit him where it hurt. I know what I said was harsh. I know it wasn\u2019t the nicest thing I could\u2019ve said. But honestly? He started it. If he\u2019d just shown me a shred of emotion,or even left me alone,I wouldn\u2019t have gone there. Now my parents are pressuring me to \u201cmake things right\u201d with him, but I don\u2019t see why I should have to apologize when he was the one who started being shitty first. AITA? UPDATE!!!!!!!:long story short i think my parents had a talk with him and if not he just came to his senses. He came and knocked on my door and i opened, he gave me the biggest hug he's ever given me in such a long time, it was much needed for both of us. He apologized and told me how he realized how much of an asshole he was being and that he has changed a lot into the worse and has just realized it. I apologized as well for reminding him of his girlfriend(and roasting the shit out of him). We legitimately had some bonding time where we kept apologizing and played fifa and just talked EVERYTHING out. And we both agreed to try ro be better with each other AND our parents and just try to become the best versions of ourselves. I was genuinely so flabbergasted that he actually did that because i haven't seen my brother show emotions in a long time. But these two days have somehow changed him and I'm not complaining. Thank you so much everyone for the advice,i really appreciate it and im so grateful for everyone who cared to read and comment, reading these positive comments made my week and made me know how i was right AND wrong and what i can do to improve myself. Again, thank you guys\ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffb\ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffb another edit: we actually ARE gonna make a funeral for romeo. ",

        "selftext": "I f22 asked my boyfriend m20 to make me tacos for when I got home later that night. I asked him to brown the ground beef and follow the instructions.  He doesn\u2019t really cook but I thought the task was simple enough. So I get home a few hours after he made the beef and things are going well. I quickly chopped the veggies so we could assemble the tacos. I thanked him for making it for me and we started eating.  I ate a bite and it tasted really bland and a bit chalky so I asked if he followed the instructions. He said, \u201cNo I just threw it together with some seasoning.\u201d So I asked him why he didn\u2019t follow the instructions and he said, \u201cI didn\u2019t know what instructions you meant.\u201d He could\u2019ve asked me what instructions? Googled it? Looked on the seasoning packet?  Anyways I am kind of a picky eater and I only eat food that tastes good. If food is just meh I would rather not eat it and he knows this. Also I cook different dishes for him all the time and do my best to make sure they taste as good as possible. So I said, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you look for the instructions or ask me?\u201d and he said, \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d This is when I got really upset and left the room. He soon followed me and said, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong.\u201d Probably thinking I was overreacting. Then I told him, \u201cI asked you to do one thing and told you to follow the instructions and you didn\u2019t do it, and you know I only eat food that tastes good. I try hard to make you good food all the time and I just wanted you to do it for me one time and you didn\u2019t even try.\u201d He kinda got defensive and said he thought it was simple and made it how he thought it was made. He said sorry and that he should\u2019ve known better, but now I feel kinda guilty and like an ungrateful bitch. AITA? EDIT: by \u201ci only eat good food\u201d i mean that i take meds and a side effect is low appetite so i only can eat if its the exact thing im craving or something cooked really well. the food he made was flavorless so i was disappointed bc i wanted the meat seasoned w the taco packet  UPDATE: We talked about it and he meant that he doesn\u2019t care about how food tastes. He made tacos before like this so he thought he already knew how to do it thats why he didn\u2019t look at the instructions and he thought it was fine. He said he will do a better job next time. Also he does clean up for me about half of the time so he does do things for me but I know I am particular about my food so usually I cook. However I was getting home late that night and I wanted something to be ready for when I got back, that\u2019s why I asked him. I also thought he could do it because he is a very smart guy and builds furniture for a living (he can follow instructions). Also I ended up just adding more seasoning and water so it is edible now. I just was tired after a long day and frustrated so I was being a bit critical and didn\u2019t want to fix it in that moment. But we are very happy and he is good to me! This was a little bickering moment and it wasn\u2019t that serious of an issue, but I wanted to know if I was being unreasonable or if he really didn\u2019t care about me. Now I think it was just a mishap and I could\u2019ve been nicer about the delivery. ALSO I wasn\u2019t mad that it didn\u2019t taste good! If he followed instructions and somehow it was terrible i would have been totally fine with it and would have helped him make it another time to teach him. I was upset because I asked him to follow the instructions on the pack and he didn\u2019t listen. And he knows that i am limited in what i can eat due to my meds and he didn\u2019t put consideration into that.",

I returned from visiting family for the holidays and I noticed the blade of my blender was severely damaged (like wavy with large burrs), and the body had 4-5 deep gouge marks in the plastic. I asked her about the damage and she explained that she hadn\u2019t touched the blender, but had lent it out two times while i was away. I told her I wish she would have asked before loaning it out and I suggested she give me money to replace it ($175 which is a ton of money for both of us), and she agreed. Now she is having second thoughts and doesn\u2019t think its fair and seems to be hinting that maybe the damage was there before she lent it out, which besides being unprovable, I feel confident that it wasn\u2019t like this before i left for the holidays. I fear that this conflict will escalate by nature of her suggesting an unprovable alternate scenario and at the core, I just don\u2019t want her to lend out my valuables without asking. Additionally this isn\u2019t the first thing she has damaged or broken or lost of mine, but it is the first time ive ever asked for her to replace something. This situation just kind of crossed a threshold for me and I truly felt resolve when she took accountability and agreed to replace the damaged one. Now that she is revealing second thoughts, I feel really confused and sad and hyper-vigilant and insecure in my home. ",

I don't make a lot so it was really upsetting to me to see my clothes in the trash (that's when I put 2 and 2 together). After that I confronted her and asked her to please stop.

I said I don't want to talk about it, you ignored that and proceeded to tell me anyway, you shouldn't have.

        "selftext": "My ex-husband and I share custody of our five kids (ages 8\u201316) on a week on/week off schedule, as per our divorce decree. This arrangement has worked well, especially since I started my own massage therapy business last year. However, my ex frequently demands to switch to a two weeks on/two weeks off schedule because he needs to travel out of state for work. He says it\u2019s too expensive to travel every weekend. To clarify, it\u2019s not a requirement for him to travel two weeks at a time, he\u2019s allowed to travel every other week, it just costs him more to travel four times a month instead of two. For context, his income is four times mine. I make about $30k a year, and he pays $730 a month in child support and $550 in spousal support, though the spousal support will end in 1.5 years. However, I use the spousal support on the kids anyway to help cover their expenses. Finding and paying for last-minute childcare adds up quickly. I already work fewer hours on the weeks I have the kids, but I can\u2019t make up for it by working more hours on my off weeks, my body simply can\u2019t handle it. So every time he changes the plan, it disrupts my client schedule and forces me to either reschedule appointments (potentially losing clients) or find (and pay for) last minute childcare. I\u2019ve told him I need consistency for both my business and the kids, but he argues I should be more flexible because his job is demanding. On top of that, the kids don\u2019t like the two weeks on/two weeks off arrangement. They are struggling as is with the week on/week off. They prefer to be with me, but there\u2019s nothing I can do about that. The two oldest begged to start therapy because of the stress their father causes them, so I got them into therapy. Now the third oldest is begging to start therapy too. I worry that the constant changes are detrimental to their mental health and overall stability. He doesn\u2019t believe in mental health and doesn\u2019t want them in therapy, but I digress.  I finally put my foot down and told him I won\u2019t keep adjusting the schedule. Now he\u2019s calling me selfish and says I\u2019m not considering how hard he works to provide for the kids. I feel like I\u2019m just protecting my business and the kids' mental health and stability. AITA?",

        "selftext": "I (25F) am child-free so maybe there is some aspect of parenthood that I\u2019m missing here. My friend Stacy (26F) had her first baby about 9 months ago,  Hailey. Stacy and I had some tension brewing in our friendship since she was pregnant. In the past, my time and energy had been very much available to Stacy. At times I felt that she took advantage of my empathy and willingness to bend over backwards for her. She lived about an hour away, and was always in some form of drama or crisis. I drove up to be with her nearly every single weekend, and the times when I told her I couldn\u2019t for one reason or another, she would beg and usually guilt me with things like \u201cI\u2019m in such a dark place, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll do if I\u2019m alone, I really need this\u201d. She also did a lot of passive aggressive shutting down from conversation when she didn\u2019t get what she wanted, leading me to always give in and put my own needs aside. This went on for years. I grew tired of this pattern and started therapy, where I learned to set healthy boundaries, speak up, and prioritize myself when it was important. These changes led me to cut the weekends I spent with her in half. I was in the process of buying a house, starting a new job and masters program, on top of family issues. I knew that she saw the change in our friendship and wasn\u2019t happy about it, but thought that with time she would understand and adjust. She never did, and insinuated that I changed because I didn\u2019t support her pregnancy or because my partner was manipulating me into not spending time with her. I explained to her many times that this wasn\u2019t the case and that I am doing all I can to be there for her.  Things came to a head when I had a health scare. I told her about it, and the next day she tried to call me. I was on the phone with someone else and couldn\u2019t answer, but texted her immediately after to let her know and make sure that everything was okay. She once again got upset because I didn\u2019t answer right away, and I had had it. On the very rare occasion that I ask for support from her she had to make it about herself. I didn\u2019t usually call her out but this time I did. I told her I didn\u2019t understand why she had an attitude, she said \u201cthanks for making me cry\u201d and then didn\u2019t respond to me for over a month. Then, when she finally did, she didn\u2019t ask about my health. She didn\u2019t apologize or even bother explaining. She instead accused me of using her daughter as a pawn by not acknowledging her. She said that Hailey didn\u2019t deserve absolutely no effort just because her and I were in a fight, and that it was so messed up that I would add Hailey into the equation. I\u2019m so confused. Hailey had nothing to do with the fight, and Stacy was the one who had ignored me for over a month. What was I supposed to do in this scenario? I can\u2019t text a 9 month old or just show up at their house. I\u2019m genuinely lost, can someone please explain this to me? AITA? \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-(EDIT) Update:Thank you for all of the comments and advice! I especially appreciate the vulnerablility of those who shared their experiences from both sides of this situation. Stacy and I have been friends for a decade, and I have long speculated that Stacy\u2019s behavior stems from her past traumas and mental health. This is a huge reason I could never bring myself to abandon her or criticize the ways she copes with life, albeit unhealthy. Although I can empathize with her experience and care about her deeply, you all helped me see that with no end in sight, it\u2019s not a sustainable friendship for me to continue. I decidedly to be brutally honest with Stacy and of course, things ended in flames. I explained that her using Hailey to guilt trip me was manipulative and crossed the line, and that it is reflective of her behavior toward me throughout our friendship. I have done my best to be a good friend but find it impossible to meet the expectations she has for me that she doesn\u2019t even seem to apply to herself. I initially said I needed some distance from her, but her response was even worse than I imagined possible and the situation is now irredeemable. Some of my favorite lines were \u201cit is all about me and my family, get that through your f*cking head\u201d and \u201cif you don\u2019t want to be my doormat, don\u2019t let the door hit you on the way out.\u201d As well as letting me know what other people say about me behind my back and that I was meant to be Hailey\u2019s godmother but she couldn\u2019t bring herself to ask me because of what an absent friend I am. She has been blocked. I\u2019m devastated and relieved, and know I\u2019m not totally blameless for remaining silent and letting resentment build for so long. Thank you Reddit!",

I find this more than a little gross, and would very much prefer she empty it down the toilet in the powder room roughly 10 feet away from the kitchen sink as I do.  Her argument is that the sink is where dirty things go and is already kind of gross besides, and some pee isn\u2019t any worse than the food scraps etc. that are in the strainer basket.

        "selftext": "I split up with my ex almost 2 years ago. My child started school the same year.  My ex was never too involved in our child's educational needs- even when she was a toddler. I handled it all myself. My child school offers multiple apps and websites. You can be up to date with everything without ever having to contact anyone, I asked my ex repeatedly to get at least the main apps, so that I don't have to keep reminding him of important dates and our child's progress,. He didn't care. Just a few examples: - whenever I asked to make a plan for any school break, he'd ask WHEN the school break is. I sent him links to the school website, but he couldn't even be bothered to save a screenshot/ make a note of the dates etc. so he'd ask again next time around too. - He couldn't be bothered to update his phone number in the school records, so the office couldn't contact him during an emergency. - I informed him about all parent teacher meetings- he said he couldn't make it, and that it made sense for me to go because he didn't know the teachers... even in September, when neither of us knew the NEW teachers. [side note: he doesn't work, I do, so I thought it was logical to have him attend, so I wouldn't have to take time off work to do so] - I'd send him any important dates- school plays, any shows, sports events etc.- he'd pick and choose the ones not involving much interaction- reading together on the world book day was a no go, but watching the kids race was okay etc. - I'd even invite him to events organized by any clubs my kids is in (clubs I organized and paid for myself), but he always had an excuse unless the events fell on his weekends, even then he'd sometimes ask me to swap the weekends. I accepted it for over a year for the sake of peace. I wanted my kid to see her dad support her achievements too. But it's been so long and I'm just tired of having to both handle the responsibility AND remember to give him updates about it. It also felt like I was trying to make him involved when he clearly wasn't interested... So last autumn I announced to him, that it was on him to stay up to date with our child's school stuff. I gave him 2 weeks to get everything sorted. I even listed all the important apps / websites so he wouldn't miss anything (the only one I didn't share was a payment portal, as I knew he wouldn't care about that one). I promised to still share any information passed via written notes / letters etc., as obviously he would not have access to those otherwise. I followed through with it. It took him 2 months to realize what's happened and now he's furious saying that I'm using the child against him. He got his family involved and now they are all bombarding me with texts saying that I'm the asshole for doing it to him and our child. His mother also pointed out that she'd done everything herself as well and didn't involve her husband in the school stuff, so she knows it's not that hard and I'm being dramatic. AITA? ",

        "selftext": "Hello Reddit. I (21) am currently living with my parents at home to save on room and board for college. I am a full-time student, work 20+ hours a week, and consistently contribute to household chores and tasks. As a family we drink a lot of milk and go through it pretty fast. My mom (53F) has always been the one to get the groceries, but since I got my license in high school, I have as well. It is rare for my dad to get family groceries. My dad (50M) is very picky about food, and for as long as I can remember, gets very upset if he doesn't have the right drink with his food. If we have pizza, he needs Coca-Cola, if we have any dessert, he needs milk. Growing up, when we ran out of one of these drinks, it would upset him. Sometimes he would slam the front door as he left, sometimes he would leave without a word. My mom was always hurt by it, and it always confused me. Why couldn't he just drink water? Well it snowed bad this week but I was able to dig my car out of the snow and pick up some drink items. I got juice and some milk. Fast-forward to yesterday. Mom got sick, but works remote. We ran out of milk as well as other items making breakfast and coffee, so I updated our grocery app. I get out to my car and it won't start. She was running a meeting, so I text to let them know I needed to take her car, which was fine with her. It's 9:00, and my dad is still asleep, he was off work. It's 11:30, I've been enjoying a lovely day at work. My dad hadn't responded to any of the family messages, but I receive this text from him: Can you please let me know when you drink the last of the milk so I can plan accordingly for my meals? He hadn't acknowledged my car troubles or that I was at work. He woke up 4 hours after the rest of us on his day off, which is fine. I respond: Hello, good morning to you too. I understand that you're frustrated, mom or I are planning to go to the grocery store after work today. I made it to work safely and am having a nice day :) Hope you enjoy your day off\u201d His response: I'm sorry if that sounded rude. I didn't mean for it to. I would really like your help with that\u00a0**issue**. I'm glad you made it safe to work, have a good day. Fair enough. I followed up by sharing the updates I made to our grocery app.\u00a0**But Reddit, this is what I wanted to say to him:** **Thank you. I'm not sure what the issue is. I was raised to not cry over spilled milk. I am not responsible for helping you plan your meals. When we run out of my favorite drinks, I drink water and go on with my day because they are a luxury, not an essential to survive. That's more than most people have in this world, and I'm grateful. Are you?** I always want to give the benefit of the doubt, and be open to the idea that I am missing something. But I feel like there's something wrong with this behavior. So, Reddit, AITA for drinking the last of the milk and not telling my dad immediately, when he is fully capable of buying groceries himself, or drinking water when it's needed?",

No one knew the other, so it wasn't easy for people to choose partners, so the chef did a ticket raffle with everyone's name, and I ended up with Tanya(23F) as my partner. Tanya has a disability as she is unable to walk due to some complications and she is on a wheelchair. I didn't have no issue looking forward to working with her and she seemed cool at first. The first few days we just theoretical, nothing much going on; hence I couldn't get to see more of what Tanya was as a course partner. So now we begin on one of our first practical classes (each class is about 5hrs) so you know we are together for quite a bit of time. We are given instructions as a whole class and the set out as a group to respective stations, where work begins such as mixing ingredients and stuff. Tanya always insisted to do divide the work so as to finish faster. She usually took the critical preparations of whatever we were preparing and she mostly messed it up, meaning our final product was way below the needed standards. She would use her disability in a subtle manner to excuse her messing up the products saying how it could be tiring to mix stuff in the position she is in, and I should just try to bear with it. So now we are always producing very shit bakes because she refuses to let me have a hand getting the ingredients together saying she doesn't want to seem like she can't keep up with the class and has something to prove. Out of everyone now I'm the only one who isn't actually gaining any skills comparing to how expensive the course is because all I'm essentially doing is cleaning up after her disastrous work and wiping surfaces. The funny thing is our station is just next to where the chef is, and he sees all these shenanigans while doing absolutely nothing. All he does is tell her how she is doing so great (*for her situation but she doesn't understand)* and this made her delusional on the quality of her work and made her insist on taking up more tasks. I got fed up because I wasn't learning anything, and significant time was passing by and i wasn't there to waste money. I spoke to the chef about the situation asking about a separation and he said it would be wrong to do that just because of her disability and it wasn't right to do so. Well, I still insisted despite him Ignoring the main issue, he gave in to my request and now I participate in the class as an individual. Tanya made it seem like I left her alone since she is disabled, and my fellow classmates now look at me like some devil with other coming up to me telling me my morals aren't right. Only a few agreed with my decision. AITAH? ",

Part of the problem was that she did not use words like left, right, forward, backward etc. - just a lot of move this way which I struggled to interpret. She also had a very stong South African accent (i.e. a different accent to mine).   Her increasing frustration and insistence that I relax (I came in reasonably relaxed but that was long gone by this stage) of course had the opposite effect, and then when she asked me to hold my breast out of the way and I heard dress instead of breast I nearly ended up in tears when she gave up on communicating and kind of grabbed my hand to pull my breast back.   I then tried to descalate the tense situation and apologised that I am a little hard of hearing and had misheard her. She immediately became angry and said in quite a shouty voice that I should have told her this and she would have spoken in a slower and louder voice. I replied that it is not an easy thing to tell people, which seemed to anger her more. I should have said that her way of conveying instructions was also perhaps not as clear as she thought it was, but did not have the guts to say this and by now was actually quite upset. All this while I am still standing at an awkward angle with one breast wedged in the machine and the other being held back by my hand and hers.

Since we weren't receiving full support, we decided to plan the wedding ourselves and finalized the details like date, venue, catering, etc. We are not and have not asked for any financial support and they have not asked if we need help in any aspect of the planning.

My boyfriend and I pointed out that Amy isn't guaranteed to be able to walk by that time, and Amy's father responded by saying that he could carry her down the aisle.

I think his fear stems from feeling replaced, which I understand when we were younger. But at this stage in our lives, it feels absurd. It\u2019s not like a new partner would \u201craise\u201d us\u2014we\u2019re adults now. I told him I\u2019m not willing to follow this rule forever, and if he chooses to cut me off for that, it will be his decision, not mine. He called it a lack of principles and insists I would be the one responsible for ending our relationship. I think this rule is controlling and unfair, and I refuse to let it dictate my life any longer, but I also don\u2019t want to lose my dad. AITA for standing my ground?",

In my mind I was thinking of the bigger picture and potentially future situations that could arise like the parents of the student reaching out to talk to me and for my own mental note to make sure my child is not bullying said child. I told her I would just contact and ask the school myself then. She immediately went into angry hysterics and called her Dad (she is very much a Daddys girl) crying and he agreed with her that he didn't see why the name was relevant, so that made her level up her amount of disrespect towards me. I explained it's now more so her belief she can tell me No about anything I am asking/insisting to know then it is about this specific situation and she said she wanted to go stay at her Dad's now, so he is on the way to pick her up. Am I the asshole for wanting the child's name or for not being ok with her telling me no?",

The three of us, along with my parents, other aunts, cousins and grandparents (basically the whole of my dad's side of the family) are all staying in the same villa that my grandparents are paying for. By the time we go on vacation, I will be about 2 months away from 18, and my sister will be 16. However, my aunt has said that she wants an adults only bathroom, and that the bathroom will not include me or my sister. I was naturally annoyed by this, especially as it meant that me and my sister would be grouped together with my younger cousins, [4M] and [6F]. She also said that she considers an adult to be anyone above the age of 21, but I know for sure that if I was wasn't this close to being 18, she would have said an adult is anyone 18+ When I asked her why this was, she says it was because we aren't hygienic. I could understand this argument in relation to my younger cousins, seeing as they are both only recently potty trained, but I can't understand how she can apply this argument towards me, given I am probably the biggest clean-freak I know. Additionally, I can't even remember the last time I shared a bathroom with her, and I have never given her any reason to believe that I am in any way unhygienic. She has also said that she wants adults-only pool time, again not including me and my sister. If I was young enough that I required supervision or inconvenienced her in some way, I would understand, but all I am doing is sharing the same common space as her, most likely without even interacting with her. Also, this is a family holiday with my parents and grandparents, it's not like she is going to be doing anything inappropriate or unsuitable for a 16 and 17 year old. I've told her to her face that I have no intention of following any of these rules, but she seems insistent that I will. She is very stubborn, but I am also extremely stubborn, and I know for a fact that I could argue about this for as long as it takes. AITA for telling her I won't follow these rules, and WIBTA if I didn't follow them.   EDIT: There has been some confusion in the comments due to how I have worded this, my cousins aren't my aunt's kids they are my other aunts kids who is also coming",

        "selftext": "My best friend\u2014let's call her Elle\u2014and I have been close for 10ish years, and during that time, she's been in a couple of relationships but has been single for a few years now. Amongst our friends, Elle is the only unmarried one. She's made it clear that she's unhappy with being single, sincerely hopes to get into a serious relationship, and get married sooner rather than later. I can understand her frustrations, especially since she's the only single friend, wants kids someday, and so on.    About a month ago, Elle told me that she intends to be more proactive with dating this year and asked if I had anyone to introduce her to. Unfortunately, I don't, but another friend mentioned knowing a great guy (who I happen to have met before) who's single, and looking for something serious.  Elle was introduced (via text) to the guy, and they soon started talking on the phone. Elle says he has a lot of good attributes (e.g. very educated, high salary) but she finds him completely unattractive because they're the same height (he's 5'7 and she's 5'7) and because of his darker skin tone. I tried to convince her that his height and looks shouldn't take precedence over his personality, but this soon led to a major revelation on her dating standards that left me completely dumbfounded.   Elle told me that she's only interested in men who, in her words, is an 8 or better (looks-wise),  taller than her when she's wearing heels, of a certain complexion, ideally no beard, has advanced degrees, making over $100k/year, doesn't have kids, and is currently attending church every week or every other week.  But the big kicker that got me was that she insists that she's unwilling to date a man (like...go out on dates) who won't commit to waiting until marriage for sex. Yes, she's religious but she's not a virign and has had sex in all past relationships.    According to Elle, this is a conversation that should be had before even the first date, and if the guy isn't firmly agreeing, it's a no-go. When I challenged her thoughts and logic on this, she got increasingly upset.   I told her that I think she's asking for a very tall order, making dating harder than it should be. I'm not saying she should compromise on her religious values, but I am trying to tell her that she should be more open-minded about her criteria because she's looking for a one in a million guy, while also prematurely shutting down and shutting out some potentially great guys because of their income and/or height.    Elle is now furious at me and says I'm not being a supportive friend. She says that I don't understand her faith and am being something of a Debbie Downer. AITA?",

My friend is helping me learn to fully take care of myself as well as help me learn not everything is my fault. We are getting low on food. My fh was complaining on Friday about there not being any food besides mac and cheese and potatoes. My friend brought up to him that he was only buying his work lunches and eating whatever their dad brought into the house that was actually meant for them because he had not been helping with groceries. He claimed he didn't make enough to buy food(he makes 400ish a week). I recommended the food bank since it was the second Tuesday of every month. He said he didn't want to eat that.  Me and my friend tried recommending food stamps but he shut that down. My friend can't file without him and I have no idea how to file. I gave up on talking to him and used my whole paycheck on stocking the house with as much food as I could instead of saving like I was supposed to be. I even cut down on the quality of dog food I was grabbing so I could buy more food. My friend's dad picked me up from the store and we brought the food home and I had a good amount of food and drinks to last awhile. He got pissed when he saw the food and complained about how I didn't get any real food.  I'm mostly vegetarian and my friend has eating issues related to textures, so I bought all safe foods and no real meat because meat was frankly way too expensive. I brought this up but he said I was being selfish and should have bought the meat anyway and cut out some of my stuff. He wouldn't listen when I explained that I looked at the meat and there was no way I could get meat and provide for everyone with the money I had.  I only had 250 to get food for 2 weeks AND food for the animals. I hadn't planned on spending the whole 250 I had originally planned on 100 on groceries and 70 on the dogs so I would have enough to fix some of them. I didn't have enough to cater to everyone but I did what I could. He's making me feel like an ass. He sold 2 of his consoles and got himself more food but keeps pouting about how little he could buy with what he got and the fact he has only has 1 console left. I feel bad for him having to sell his stuff to get meat. My friend is mad at their husband telling him to be grateful, my brain is saying I fucked up again. I feel like an ass with how he's acting. Adding this I don't care if you eat meat! I just feel sick after eating alot of it so I gave up and went on a mostly veg diet. I do not care that he eats meat I just care about the fact he threw a fit and acts like I did something wrong by not buying the meat when I hadn't even planned to spend that much. I am not asking for money. I have a job I am happy with I don't make alot of money but I make enough to take care of mine and my friends pups and enough where I can eat and afford my share of the bills.  Edit: I am adding this. PLEASE STOP TELLING ME TO GET RID OF MY DOGS. One of them is an ESA i need to function like a normal human being. She helps me with my anxiety and paranoia. She helps me know when I'm having an anxiety spike and just hearing things that aren't there when I'm alone. I need this dog. Adding more because someone thinks this is a larp? Don't know what that is. I'm not dating my friend I'm nonbinary and into girls and other nonbinary people. Men are not on my list of attractions at all. We live in a house it's not the best but it fricken works. The dogs were not fricken bought they were an accidental litter that was unexpected.

Keep in mind, I have gained a bit of weight since the last time they have seen me and I\u2019m quite out of shape and struggling to keep up when we start the practice. My coach says welcome back and hugs me and stuff and he basically catches me up on everything that\u2019s happened, what I\u2019ve missed, etc. Then we start the warm up, it was quite difficult for me as I haven\u2019t swam in almost 2 months. To begin the warm up, we had to dive off the blocks, my dive was really slow and sloppy as I haven\u2019t practiced for a while.

I tell her to PO and to not talk about things like that and I left early.

        "selftext": "So I come from a culture where it is common for the woman\u2019s mother to stay with her and assist her during the end of pregnancy, the birth and the first few weeks after the baby is born until she fully recovers and is able to care for the baby unassisted. My mom has always talked about wanting to do this for me. This is my first pregnancy so while I am very nervous when I announced it I knew my mom was looking forward to helping me through this phase as I am her only daughter. My brother and SIL already have one child and she found out she was pregnant with her second and was due soon after me.  My SIL and I have a great relationship and when she had her first child she chose to have it in our home country where her parents are. She had the same support from her own mother at the time and even extra support from other relatives including my mom. Although I live in the US I went to visit her and help in any way I could because she felt that was important (I did too). Since then, she and my brother have moved to the US for career reasons (me, brother and SIL are all citizens but all of our parents live in our home country). They decided to stay in the US to have their second child. We are both due soon and unfortunately, her parents had some visa processing issues and cannot come in time for the delivery or shortly after. My mom however got approved and was planning to stay with me as we had discussed before.  My brother asked my mom the other day if she could come help my SIL out for the delivery as her parents could not make it and she is expected to deliver 1-2 weeks after me. When she told me I (under the assumption I would have already delivered by then) told her that I think it makes sense for her to fly out briefly for the delivery and the initial nights but that she should come back soon after. When my SIL heard this she was upset and said that she doesn\u2019t have any family here and my mom was the only family she had and that she should atleast be able to stay for the same 1-2 weeks that she is expected to help me out post partum before my SIL\u2019s due date. I countered by saying that I feel awful that her parents couldn\u2019t make it in time and that\u2019s why I\u2019m fine with my mother leaving for a few days to help her out but that this is my first pregnancy and I always thought my mom would be there in the way that we have always wanted and that at the very least she has been around the block before.  Now my mom doesn\u2019t know what to do and I think she feels guilty. She has a good relationship with both me and SIL and doesn\u2019t want to upset anyone. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m being selfish here so AITA? Edit: just splitting the post into paragraphs for better readability. Sorry about that! Thanks for pointing that out.  Edit 2: After reading some comments I want to clarify a few things: 1. Both SIL and I have supportive partners who will be taking time off regardless. It is not about that. In my culture and many others, childbirth is something where the women in our community come together to help. After growing up and leaving your parent\u2019s house this is really one of the few moments you can feel like you need your mom again and have that bonding moment. I\u2019m sure we both would manage if we only had our partners but it\u2019s not just about that for us. If worse comes to worse and we both have difficult deliveries that require that kind of support then my own MIL could be there for me then. In the scenario described above where one of us do not necessarily need my mom there more than the other I would prefer to experience this phase with my own mother. I do not have a bad relationship with my own MIL but we have a good understanding of our boundaries and I would not feel as comfortable asking for the same things or being as vulnerable as I would be with my own mother especially during a time where emotions are high and hormones are fluctuating.  2.  For the people saying that both I and SIL are entitled or taking advantage of my mom, I want to stress that she WANTS to do this. Not just because of culture or an expectation but because she is very passionate about pregnancy and childcare and has always told me she has been looking forward to having that moment with me when I have a baby. Back in our home country she has done this for countless and more distantly related women in our community and feels empowered by it.  3. Our due dates are about 11 days apart so I said 1-2 weeks to account for some buffer time. The people a saying that either of us could deliver early or late are correct. As of now we are both having healthy pregnancies and expected to deliver close to the due date and what I told her was simply under the conditions that we do deliver 1-2 weeks within each other without major complications. If the situation changes I am open to changing my perspective. ",

I told her she could wait for a ride because I know there was no way I'm getting that money back on her first check. She already owes back rent for being here for a month and contributing nothing. She called me heartless then told me not to worry because she sees what kind of friend I am. She said it was freezing outside and she could die of hypothermia. We live in the south and it was 43\u00b0F. Later, she called me right before my husband was going to come get her and said someone was nice and is giving me a lift home so save your precious gas. I shrugged it off but she's not talking to me. So. Am I the asshole?",

        "selftext": "Am I the asshole Navy Shower Edition. I (33F) am married to my husband (42M). We have two young boys under 5 and live out of state from my parents. It's about a three hour drive to their house and we visit fairly often. They have a larger home in a beautiful neighborhood and they have very well paying jobs. Since we have young kids, we often stay for the whole weekend. My dad (58M) is ex-military and grew up taking Navy Showers as he calls them. My grandfather always made my dad and his brothers as well as anyone else who stayed at their house take them as well. It's essentially a regular shower except you turn the water off when you're soaping yourself up and shampooing your hair. So you'll turn the water on to start the shower then turn the water off to soap up and shampoo your hair and then turn the water back on to rinse off. My grandfather always said it saved tons of water and was efficient. Growing up, I always thought it was ridiculous because it just meant you were standing there freezing while the water was off for half your shower. My dad always rolled his eyes over it too. Just this past weekend though, he told my husband and I that we needed to start taking navy showers when we visited. He said my husband takes too long of a shower while he's there and it's wasting water so he wants us both to do them. He and my mom both shower that way everyday because he believes it saves water and is better for their septic system. It should be noted that my husband is not taking long, luxurious showers for fun. He is balding and shaves his head in the shower every morning to prevent stubble. His showers are roughly 20 minutes long and again, it's because he has to shave his head. Anyway, my dad told us this and we both politely said okay. However, later in the day he brought it up again and I told him I thought it was a little ridiculous to stand in a freezing shower without water just to save, at most, 2 minutes worth of water. Not to mention my husband would be turning the water on and off every time he needed to rinse his razor. My dad just repeated that we, but especially my husband, takes too long of a shower. He claims my husband takes 30-45 minute showers while he\u2019s there. I explained that my husband has never taken that long of a shower and that it\u2019s a little weird to be monitoring the length of our showers. I told him that it makes us both, but especially my husband, feel awkward and we both feel like we are being judged. He wouldn\u2019t budge and just repeated he wanted us to shower that way while at his house because he believed it was better. We, of course, respected what he said and did the navy showers this weekend, but AITA or is it actually a ridiculous request?  It should also be noted that we all live in the Midwest and it was 12 degrees out this weekend with snow and they keep their house at 67 in the winter so standing in a shower when you\u2019re completely wet without the water running really sucks. My parents are well off so it\u2019s not a money issue either. I don\u2019t mention them being well off to say that therefore money doesn\u2019t matter. I just wanted to provide context.  Edit: my husband and I both respect my dad a lot and will absolutely follow the navy shower rule when we are there. I'm actually very close with my dad and he and I have always had a great relationship. I am in no way going to disrespect his rules or stop visiting. I am not even angry about the new rule. At the end of the day, it\u2019s their house and my husband and I respect them enough to follow it. I just think it\u2019s a weird request from them.  Edit 2: I know 20 minutes isn't a quick shower. I take about 5 minute showers myself.  Edit 3: My kids and I visit frequently, but my husband only stays overnight 1-2 times per year. He has a crazy work schedule so he\u2019s not able to come for overnights as often so his showering habits are only an issue 1-2 times per year. ",

        "selftext": "I (23F) am going to be a bridesmaid in my fianc\u00e9\u2019s older sister\u2019s wedding, which is set for October 2025. While I\u2019m excited to be part of her big day, I\u2019ve been a bridesmaid before and know how expensive it can be. The costs for this wedding are piling up quickly. I\u2019ve already paid $300 for the bridesmaid dress, the required shoes, and $1,000 for the destination bachelorette trip. Initially, we were told there was no pressure to attend, but her mom later said it was \u201cshitty\u201d that some bridesmaids were considering skipping due to the cost, so I felt pressured to go. After we booked the trip, the maid of honor informed us that we would also be covering all of the bride\u2019s costs during the trip\u2014food, drinks, and anything else. This was never discussed beforehand and added another unexpected expense on top of an already expensive trip. My future MIL mentioned that, as a bridesmaid, I\u2019m expected to help pay for the bridal shower. She said she Googled it and found that the bridesmaids are responsible for the costs, not her as the mother of the bride. In all the weddings I\u2019ve been part of, the bridal shower costs were primarily covered by family or a family friend who volunteered to host it at their home. The bridesmaids usually helped with smaller things like games and decorations. I don\u2019t mind contributing to the bridal shower, but it needs to be within reason. With everything else I\u2019ve already paid for, it\u2019s becoming unmanageable\u2014especially since I\u2019m trying to save for my own wedding, which is planned for mid-2026. My future SIL is expecting a fully catered bridal shower with elaborate d\u00e9cor, which feels unrealistic for a group of bridesmaids to fund. It also seems like she\u2019s picking things that aren\u2019t even within her budget and assuming others will cover the difference. Am I the asshole for wanting to set boundaries around the bridal shower costs, especially when it feels like at every turn an unexpected expense comes up without any discussion? I know weddings are expensive (as I am currently planning one), but how much is too much to ask your bridesmaids to pay? In previous weddings I was a bridesmaid in, I would spend about $1,200 total! In this case, that\u2019s not even covering the bachelorette trip. I do want to make this whole thing special for her, but it\u2019s just starting to get very costly and I know the other bridesmaids are feeling the pressure too. We are all young and just starting our careers.  EDIT: I\u2019ve already spoken to my fianc\u00e9 about this and he agrees it\u2019s out of line. He has my back on however I choose to approach this and was curious to see everyone\u2019s responses and advice. We are a young couple and are open to advice on how to handle this. He\u2019s already offered to speak to his family, but based on prior situations, he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019ll go anywhere. The two of us have drawn our lines on these matters on previous issues, and in fact moved further away to really separate into our own family while in pursuit of our careers. ",

        "selftext": "I\u2019m an 18-year-old female. My best friend, Sarah, started dating someone online a few months ago, and it has changed our relationship dynamic. We've been arguing frequently due to misunderstandings. I asked her parents if I could fly up to see her for her birthday, and they paid for the tickets despite my offer to cover it myself. However, Sarah told me she planned to spend most of her time on the phone with her boyfriend and might kick me out of her room. This made me reconsider the trip, as I wanted to visit her, not just be a third wheel. After a misunderstanding, she clarified that she would call him during downtime and spend holidays with him, which seemed fair. We hung up, but then her boyfriend texted me (he already had my number) about Sarah having a bad day and said my uncertainty about visiting made it worse. I felt this was inappropriate and told him to mind his business. Sarah then told me I couldn't speak to him that way and that she had given him permission to text me the message.  I was shocked and explained that he crossed a boundary. She responded that her business was his, which made me feel disrespected. I had her parents cancel my tickets, but I expressed gratitude for their support. I felt uncomfortable visiting, especially with the potential for further arguments and disrespect for my boundaries. Sarah defended her boyfriend, saying he was just trying to help and that she really wanted me there for her birthday. She was upset that I won\u2019t be there, expressing that it hurt her deeply, especially since she had fought her dad for months to be able to visit me (though he ultimately said no). I reminded her that I had to remind her about my own birthday during a busy time when she was moving. She said it will take a long time for her to get over the hurt of me choosing not to visit.  I think I might be the asshole because at the end of the day it is her 18th birthday and I don\u2019t want her to hold this over my head.   I don\u2019t want to be in an environment where I might argue again, and I\u2019d rather focus on my own life and obligations. Given the situation, do you think I did anything wrong? AITA for canceling my trip to see my best friend for her 18th birthday? (Edit: they both met because I introduced them. He and I ran gaming channels and he messaged me to collaborate. I said yes and asked if I could bring a friend, she\u2019s that friend.) ",

        "selftext": "I have a roommate who pays me about 90% of half the rent\u2014so if the total rent is $1,600, they contribute around $700. I cover the rest, along with water, gas, internet, and electricity, because I earn more than they do. When they first moved in, I felt sorry for them because they were leaving an abusive situation. It\u2019s been a little over a year since they moved into my guest room, and overall, it hasn\u2019t been too bad. However, when they moved in, I had some of my belongings in the closet\u2014primarily books. The room is fully furnished with my furniture, including a large bed that takes up a lot of space, a heavy bookshelf, and around 500 books stored in 5\u20136 boxes and two large bags. I always intended to go through them, pick out my favorites, and donate or sell the rest, but due to my ADHD and object impermanence, I kept pushing it off. In the long run, I envisioned turning the room into a closet/library after they moved out since I prefer having my clothes visible rather than stored away. Last year, I came home to find my bookshelf outside by the dumpsters. I immediately told my roommate to put it back in the room because they had no right to throw away my belongings. If they had asked, I would have found another place for it, but I was so frustrated that I insisted they return it to the room without offering an alternative solution. Fast forward to now: I recently hired someone to help clean my apartment when work gets too busy. They offered to organize my cabinets, which reminded me to finally sort through my books\u2014only to be told that my roommate had thrown them all away months ago. Over 500 books\u2014hardcover, paperback, large, small, books I had kept since middle school\u2014just gone. They never asked, never mentioned feeling uncomfortable with them in the closet, never gave me a chance to move them. They simply decided to discard decades of my history without my permission. I was so upset that I haven\u2019t spoken to them in over a week. It\u2019s not just about the books\u2014it\u2019s about the complete lack of respect for my things. My first instinct is to kick them out (yes, I understand the legal complexities of tenancy and eviction), but instead, I\u2019ve decided that I no longer want to cover the bulk of the bills. I\u2019ve drafted a document that evenly splits all household expenses, which will increase their contribution by at least $500. WIBTA if I taped it to their door? This isn\u2019t the arrangement we originally agreed upon when they moved in, but at this point, I feel that if they can blatantly disrespect my belongings, they no longer deserve my generosity. ",

        "selftext": "I (15M) have been alternating weeks between my parents homes basically my whole life. They split up when I was a baby and have both remarried since. I've been happy for the most part. I love my step dad and my siblings (have some on both sides). My only issue has been my step mom.  Tbh, I wouldn't say I had any real issues in the past. I do find her more annoying with more strict rules then what I have at my moms house (She's a Vice Principal, very serious) , but recently, she has been taking shots to my dad and I about my mom and step dad. (Which might have always been a thing, but now that I'm older she is just doing it more infront of me?)  Saying things like she doesn't take my education seriously, she's never grown up, they flaunt their money in front of her and my dad, they spoil me, they let me get away with everything. I honestly don't even know where she comes up with this. My dad doesn't really say anything, agrees occasionally, but it's been making me angrier and angrier.  Obviously, I would never admit it to my dad, but I do love my mom more. She is like the most awesome and important person to me, and hearing my step mom say crap just made me boil over....... I finally broke and yelled at her after she blamed my mom for me getting a poor mark on an exam. I told her to shut her mouth about my mom and that if she said one more word, I would pack a bag and stay with my mom permanently. My dad flipped and yelled at me to apologize, but I told him if he didn't make her apologize that I was leaving. He said my mom would never allow it, and I made the mistake of saying we talked about it before.  He then called my mom and started a fight with her..... thinking she put me up to this. I couldn't handle it, so I left the house and called my step dad to come get me.  I've been at my mom's, but my dad's been texting and calling every day, jumping from begging me to come home, apologizing, to getting into fights with my mom and step dad. I feel like an asshole for causing a huge fight between my families..... Edit: Thank you everyone for the replies so far. I know I shouldn't have said it was something my mom and I talked about. We did a few years ago when I was like 12 when I wanted to stay longer at my moms and had like a moment where I got upset and told her it was hard sometimes not seeing her for a week, but that was the only time it was ever mentioned. So I feel like an ass for saying it.  As for people asking me about custody agreements, I don't think there is any? They had me really young (20 years old) and they split when I was a baby. I was with my mom all the time till I was 3 or 4 and then I started spending more consecutive days with my dad. My mom also has never asked my dad for child support and tbh I don't think she would even if I stayed full time.  Update*  So I have spoken with my mom about it and it probably made me more mad at the situation. She didn't have a bad word to say about my Dad or my Step Mom. I told her what that were saying about her and SHE apologized to me. Saying she loves me, that she's sorry I had be apart of those conversations, that she has big shoulders and can take the criticism and will make it clear to my Dad and Step Mom that if they have concerns that they can address it with her and my Step Dad and leave me out of it. That she would love to have me full time but doesn't want me to make a decision to not see my dad and my other siblings (who I do miss) because of her.  I told her I can't stand the way they talk about her and she didn't really say anything, just kind of started crying, saying I had a big heart and that she loved me. She told me she will deal with my dad and to let her know when I'm ready to talk to him about the situation. ",

        "selftext": "A couple of months ago,I and five of my friends planned a holiday together for Berlin. One of my friends, let's call him James, decided it would be easier if he booked all of the accommodation and we sent him the money for it. We all agreed to this, and I planned to pay for it at the end of the month after I had gotten paid. However, a week before the trip was to begin, I was no longer able to attend however I promised to pay in full for my part. However, this is where my other friend, Peter, gets involved. He was part of the original planning of the trip but decided he could not afford it and was thus not included in the booking. However, once he heard that I was unable to attend but still paying for the room James had booked, he said he wanted to go. Naturally, everyone agreed that he could and so I didn't pay for my part assuming that Peter would cover it. He did not. The trip went off without a hitch, however, upon return, James asked me when I was going to be able to pay him back. I was confused because I hadn't gone on the trip and said that it was Peter's responsibility which made Peter very upset. He said that because I had agreed to go on the trip and had cancelled with such short notice that it was my job to pay for it as if he hadn't decided to go, the room would have been empty and a waste of money. He argued that because I make more money than him and he couldn't afford to pay for the accommodation, it was my fault and I shouldn't have planned the trip if I couldn't keep my promises. I would have no problem paying James for the money he spent on the room if it had remained empty but the fact that Peter saw that as his chance to have a cheaper holiday is causing me to refuse. As a result of this, James is no longer talking to either of us saying he will once we can start acting like adults and someone pays him the money. Am I in the wrong? Edit: names changed to improve clarity  Edit 2: to clarify as to why James couldn't cancel the booking, the booking was for a shared six person room so if he cancelled it would not have been possible to rebook",

No plans are set in stone at the moment that was just the estimate they gave him for the service. After talking to him tonight and explaining that I will NOT be footing the bill for any sort of big expensive funeral, he left the apartment, after a long argument, to stay with his grandmother and basically hasn\u2019t spoke to me since. We don\u2019t have any combined finances/accounts so at this point I\u2019m just over it and he can stay gone for all I care.  New to Reddit so forgive me for any formatting issues. To make a long story short my (31) fianc\u00e9's (35) mother recently passed. She was never really in his life (abandoned him at birth) and l've only met her one time in the 8 years we've been together. Recently she had come back into his life and they were on civil terms. We got news from the hospital that she had died and they immediately wanted to know what funeral home we wanted to send her to and of course my fianc\u00e9 decides he's obligated to figure all of this out since his other siblings are MIA or incarcerated. I recommended to him we just do something simple and keep it on the cheaper side since no one else will be helping financially and he doesn't have any savings either she also didn't have any kind of life/burial insurance. Well today he surprises me after work with a 10k bill that he expects me to pay the majority of out of my savings because he can't afford it. I will admit I did help pay for his dad's cremation multiple years ago but it wasn't near the cost of what he's wanting to do now. We just recently moved into a more expensive apartment and at this point a 10 thousand dollar funeral is just not on the table but he won't budge.",

For a few years we didn't get to see each other much because we went to college on opposite sides of the country, but I moved to her city last year so we really got to catch up with each other.  Hayley will be turning 25 in a week so we - along with some other friends - started planning her birthday party a while ago. She wanted to have a rather big party so that she could invite all of her friends groups, but we couldn't find anywhere to have it and she lives in a small apartment. I on the other hand have a house, it's not that big but it's big enough to host the party. So our friends started bringing it up and said that we could throw the party at my house.  I was fine with that. I did find it kinda weird that they were the one to bring it up, because I personally wouldn't suggest throwing a party in someone else's house unless they were the one to suggest it, but it didn't really matter. So I said yes, my only conditions were that the party didn't turn into chaos, that no one got too drunk, and that they helped me clean up the next day. Everyone was fine with that so we agreed on it.  Yesterday, Hayley sent me a text to tell me how many people would be there. That's when she asked me if I could get my cat out of the house for the night, because one of her friends from college is allergic. I told her that I didn't have anywhere else to leave him, but that I could make sure that he stayed upstairs while we were downstairs. I also told her that my cat is very shy and easily scared so there's no way he'd get close to her friend.  She then told me that I could just leave him with my parents and then go back to get him the next day. My parent's house is about an hour and a half drive and there's just no way I'd drive a total of 6 hours in one weekend. I told her that it really wasn't possible for me to leave him with my parents but that he would be locked upstairs and I'd deep clean the house to make sure there's no cat hair anywhere. I also told her that she should've told me earlier and I could've found another solution, but now the party is in less than a week.   She told me that I wasn't being helpful and that I was ruining her party, and she's been bitching about me to a lot of our mutual friends. I told her that I had no obligation to let her do the party at my house and I kindly accepted to do so, so the least she could do was to be grateful. She hasn't replied since. Most of our friends agree with me, but I also feel a bit guilty. I don't know if I'm in the wrong here and I don't know what else I can do.  ",

I\u2019ve been trying to sell this tv that works perfectly fine for a bit now and I have a video of it being turned on and off on the post. The last times I turned it on which was this morning it worked perfect not even a scratch on it. My partner and I both carry it to our Kia soul that had the seats down so we could lay it flat screen facing up to not scratch it or break it and transported it to the meet up place. I sell it to this person and my partner and I watch as this person is shoving a 55inch tv SCREEN DOWN into the backseat of a Kia optima that has a car seat in it. I asked her at least 4 times if she needed/wanted my help and she repeatedly told me NO. I got into our car and my partner and I both agreed that this person just broke the screen of the perfectly good tv I just sold them.They texted me and told me the screen was broken and I replied with \u201cThe screen wasn't broken when we gave it to you so idk what to tell you. I used it this morning. I transported to you screen up to make sure it didn't touch anything or get broken.\u201d They called me a scammer, hurting for money, dishonest, said they were going to call the police on me if I didn\u2019t give them their money back, that they had my license plate and was going to blast me on fb.  I feel like I did my part to make sure the tv got to them safely and I tried to help her several times and got rejected. This is my first time experiencing something like this. Am I the asshole? \ud83d\ude05",

        "selftext": "Let me preface with that I fully understand that many people have different viewpoints of \u201chonoring\u201d their parents, lol. So my husband and I apparently have differing views about honoring our parents, and I\u2019ve been made out to be the \u201casshole\u201d by his family multiple times. His family is not respecting of boundaries I\u2019ve put up, and he (husband) also put up, and so I\u2019ve definitely been a bit more rigid about things. My husband already ruined what I wanted for our wedding by inviting his whole extended family as his parents wanted him to (I wanted something more intimate), letting his mother take unwanted \u201cformal\u201d wedding pictures which made me uncomfortable (we\u2019d hired a photographer), and just other various things. They push and push and push and it\u2019s suffocating.  Anyways\u2014 now I\u2019ve become the asshole again because I don\u2019t want to \u201chonor\u201d his parents by letting them see me and our firstborn child within the first 24 hours of me giving birth. (I don\u2019t want my parents there, either, lol, I just want it to be the two of us.) I already know myself and my body and my emotions, and with how overbearing his parents are\u2014 I know it\u2019s going to be hell for me. He claims that the birth isn\u2019t \u201cjust about us, it\u2019s about our parents, too\u201d which I laughed in his face about (maybe that\u2019s asshole-ish, lol). My parents don\u2019t believe their first grandchild is about them, and so I\u2019m not sure where my husband and his parents get this notion. AITA for sticking my ground and refusing that? I feel like I\u2019m going literally insane, lol. ",

        "selftext": "Using my alternate because I don\u2019t want this traced back to me and my spouse gets my email notifications for my main on his phone. Basically, my husband (30M) thinks I (28F) am a jerk for not saying thank you about baby-related tasks. We have a 7 month old and we both work full time\u2014a few days during the week remotely, and twice a week the LO goes to daycare. I\u2019m up every day at 6:15 am to pump, then I get the baby up and ready if he hasn\u2019t woken up already, make sure he\u2019s changed, has a bottle, has breakfast, is dressed, and is happy while husband is still asleep or just getting on his work computer. I telework with LO on Mondays and Wednesdays (DH is there both days), but I don\u2019t really get anything done, which is really frustrating because I\u2019m still training in my job and I get anxious trying to balance LO and work. Tuesdays I\u2019m out the door bringing LO to daycare by 7:30 while husband is usually still in the shower.  He usually asks me to let out the dogs because he\u2019s running late. I pump during the day to feed LO which also takes time out of my day. I make dinner every day, and I almost always feed the baby dinner too. We play on the floor while husband is on his phone on the couch, which is a little irritating because his baby is doing cute things. Then I start bath time at 7:00, and spouse will usually fill the baby tub for me. He\u2019ll also warm a bottle for me. Then I put LO to bed and we watch TV for a while. I unload and reload the dishwasher and try to start a load of bottles in the sterilizer. If LO gets up in the middle of the night, he\u2019ll warm a bottle and I\u2019ll change and feed LO and get him back to bed. I miss sleeping a bit longer on Saturdays, it\u2019d be nice if I could go back to sleep after pumping in the AM on Saturdays but husband is usually still asleep. All of this is to outline my mental load. But, every time my husband does something like unloads the dishwasher, puts dishes in the dishwasher, or does the bottles, etc., he makes a giant stink: \u201cDid you see I did the dishes? Did you see I did the bottles? Did you see I took out the trash? Are you gonna say thank you?\u201d  Like, yes of course I noticed, but these are things I do all the time and they are expected of you too? I don\u2019t care if I get a thank you? Like the other day, I cleaned your work desk because it was horribly dusty, take your dirty dishes every day, and tidy the baby\u2019s room but I didn\u2019t get a thank you. I also don\u2019t make a stink about not getting a thank you. Why is it necessary for me to thank you when I have a million other things on my mind? So I say thanks for doing that, but then he gets grumpy that my tone is hateful. I just don\u2019t have the capacity to be all gushy and grateful that he did things that are expected. AITA for not thanking him? I just think it\u2019s crazy to constantly say thank you for tasks like this.",

        "selftext": "I (26F) and my partner (27F) planned a birthday dinner for her father (FIL) at a steakhouse. A while back, I received a gift and a $200 gift card to this restaurant as a thank-you from a contractor I work closely with, which I thought would be perfect for the occasion. During Christmas, I opened the gift (with the gift card) and my SIL (31F) was there to see me holding up the gift card. She immediately suggested we use it for FIL's birthday. I agreed, but I didn\u2019t realize she\u2019d interpret \u201cwe\u201d to mean she could invite her BF (recently reconciled after a year-long breakup) and go all-out with their orders. A few days before the dinner, SIL asked if her BF could join. I was hesitant since he hadn\u2019t been around for a year, and the family has mixed feelings about him. My partner doesn\u2019t like conflict and said yes, so he came. At the dinner, things got awkward fast. SIL and her BF ordered the most expensive items on the menu. They both ordered surf and turf with extra lobster tail while the rest of us ordered modestly. Their meal alone was over $150. At the end of the meal, SIL then suggested dessert, but I declined since my partner and I already bought a cake for FIL. The bill came to be approximately $300 after tax and tip. I used the gift card but still had to pay $100 with my credit card. I asked SIL to cover her and her BF\u2019s share and split the cost of FIL\u2019s meal with me, explaining that the gift card wasn\u2019t \u201cfree money\u201d for her and her BF to splurge. She got upset, said the gift card should cover everything, and stormed out with her BF. Later, my partner and I drove my in-laws home and dropped them off in awkward silence. On the way back, my partner told me I was out of line, but I feel justified since SIL\u2019s actions caused the bill to exceed the gift card\u2019s value. AITA? Update 1: Thank you everyone for commenting and providing feedback in this thread! The comments here has help me see things in a different perspective and now will help me prevent such thing from happening again in the future. I received a call from my FIL this afternoon (the dinner was last night). He called to thank me for organizing and paying for the dinner. He also mentioned that he plans to call SIL later today to talk to her, though I\u2019m not sure how much detail he will go into. So far, I\u2019ve apologized to SIL for any miscommunication and for asking her to split at the dinner table. However, I haven\u2019t received a response from SIL, and my partner has been cold toward me. Honestly, I don't expect to get paid back, this is just a lesson for me to learn. Updates 2: This is probably my last update, and I think there\u2019s a resolution to this problem. I got a call from SIL in the evening; she apologized and Venmoed me $100, which is better than nothing. My partner and I also had a serious discussion about their family, and I feel like there\u2019s been some progress in improving the relationship between me and their family. I\u2019ve seen a lot of comments saying I have no backbone or that I\u2019m a pushover, and that\u2019s probably true to a certain degree. Their family dynamic is still new to me, and I didn\u2019t want to make a bad impression in front of my FIL and MIL, so I held back. Unfortunately, I ended up snapping at the end. I\u2019ve learned a valuable lesson to speak up for myself and not cave when things feel unfair. Quick clarification on payment: My partner and I share a joint credit card, which we use to pay for meals out. SIL has a habit of avoiding credit cards, though I\u2019ve never looked into why. Typically, when dining with my partner\u2019s family, I cover the bill with our joint card, and SIL Venmos me her portion plus 50% of my in-laws\u2019 portion. That\u2019s why I asked her to cover her share and at least split FIL\u2019s cost with me for his birthday dinner.",

        "selftext": "My (23M) cousin (30M) and his GF (32F) recently had to move out of their place after his girlfriend lost her job. My cousin has been unemployed for quite some time due to his mental health, which is a sore subject for him (this will be relevant later). His GF has been job searching, but it\u2019s a long process and they need somewhere to stay in the meantime, so they\u2019ve been staying with me and my roommate (22M).\u00a0 I didn\u2019t love this arrangement in the first place since we have a two-bedroom apartment and I\u2019ve needed to move into my roommate\u2019s room to make space, but it\u2019s family and my roommate says he doesn\u2019t mind having me in his room for now (plus my aunt is paying us) so whatever.\u00a0 The problem is that my cousin and his GF have insisted on bringing their emotional support dog with them (not a service dog). It\u2019s technically fine in terms of our lease and I don\u2019t mind dogs in general so at first I said OK, but this thing has been a nightmare. It\u2019s loud, pees on our floors, and it chewed up one of our couch pillows. My cousin and his GF think this behavior is hysterical and endearing, but every time my roommate and I tried to bring up that we\u2019d rather they find somewhere else for their dog, they go on and on about how they can\u2019t possibly part with their \u201cfur baby\u201d and just will not hear it. This all kind of culminated last night because my roommate had an important presentation this morning so he tried to go to bed early last night, but the dog would not stop barking. My cousin and his GF were all like \u201cawww she wants to play\u201d but my roommate and I were pretty annoyed. I told my cousin that this arrangement was not working and that he needed to find somewhere else to put the dog. He told me again that it\u2019s their \u201cfur baby\u201d, and his GF started getting really upset and telling me we were making the dog feel unwelcome and it was like asking them to part with their child. I told them that the dog is not a baby and that they need to take responsibility for it or find somewhere else for the three of them to stay. He reminded me that he needs the dog for emotional support and that his GF is trying to find a job and they have nowhere to go until then. Partially out of anger, I told him that his emotional support needs weren\u2019t my problem and that maybe he should try getting a job too. I know he\u2019s had a rough time with his mental health and how that impacts employment so I think those two statements put together cut a little deeper than I intended, and he hasn\u2019t been talking to me today and his girlfriend called me an ableist for what I said. My aunt texted me this morning that my cousin and his GF plan on moving out this weekend with their dog and that I was way too harsh with him. I do understand why the comment had that effect on them and I feel bad for that, but it finally got the dog out of our place after we\u2019ve been trying the gentler approach so I don\u2019t really know what else I could\u2019ve done.

        "selftext": "AITA? My (27m) husband and I (26f) have been living together for about 3 years. We have always had a basket in the bathroom for dirty laundry. The entire time we\u2019ve been living together I\u2019m the one who has always done laundry. When the basket gets full I take it to the laundry room and wash everything that\u2019s in it. For the past several months my husband has started leaving his dirty clothes mostly in a pile in the floor in the bedroom instead of putting them in the basket. We\u2019ve had conversations about this several times and he says he\u2019ll make sure to start putting his clothes in the basket, but nothing has really changed. This morning he made a comment about how he has to go to work in dirty clothes. Including dirty socks and underwear. I didn\u2019t say anything because I\u2019ve washed the clothes in the basket and was caught up on laundry. Then he asks me if I could wash his clothes for him so he doesn\u2019t have to go to work in dirty clothes. I told him that I\u2019ll wash his clothes when he puts them in the basket. He got mad and said I was petty for not washing his laundry and that he doesn\u2019t understand why I can\u2019t take 30 more seconds to pick up all his clothes off the floor and wash them. I told him that if it was so easy then why couldn\u2019t he take 30 seconds to pick them up and do it and that I wasn\u2019t his mom and I\u2019m not picking up his dirty clothes off the floor when there\u2019s a basket. According to him I\u2019m a petty asshole and don\u2019t do anything for him because I refuse to pick up his clothes from the floor to wash them. Am I the asshole for not picking up his clothes?",

        "selftext": "I\u2019m 19F in college living with four other roommates and we all pretty much eat microwave food that goes in our freezer. We have a very small freezer and for the first half of the year it wasn\u2019t that bad to fit stuff in it because our fourth roommate wasn\u2019t really using it and we all shopped lightly. Recently I\u2019ve noticed that our freezer is literally packed to the point that it won\u2019t close. I\u2019ve noticed that it\u2019s food that they all keep in there for weeks without eating. I have exactly one thing in there and it barely takes up any room. For perspective, said roommate just went out and bought food for the next two weeks and took up so much space. I texted the groupchat and asked them to reorganize and consider other peoples space when shopping for groceries, or for them to eat them within the next week. My roommate said \u201cI\u2019ll eat half of my stuff in the next week\u201d and then brushed off my request and just said that it\u2019ll be hard to fit stuff no matter what because it\u2019s a small space for four people. That felt very dismissive and like she\u2019s refusing to come up with a solution that\u2019s fair for everyone. So I texted back and asked if she would shop for groceries for the next week instead of two weeks from now on. She sent back a pretty angry-sounding text saying that she shops when she wants to and doesn\u2019t feel like going to the store every week.  I have no idea what to do! I really want space for the freezer. Talked to my pops about this and he said \u201ceither you buy fresh food or put your foot down with then because they\u2019re being selfish.\u201d I\u2019m going to try to buy fresh food to put elsewhere but it\u2019s hard for me to eat them before they expire so quickly. Being a college student I really just want quick easy meals. Did I push it too far? AITA?",

        "selftext": "I 19F was adopted at birth. I don\u2019t know this until I was 17. I found out in the worst way possible. My grandpa was drunk and told me. I asked my parents and they confessed. They called me ungrateful for asking. After finding out I was adopted a lot of things suddenly made sense. My parents family often excluded me from things like family pictures and reunions. My mom would fight it (sometimes) but it wouldn\u2019t help. It felt like I never fit in. When I turned 18 I moved in with my roommate. She said it might be cool to find out who my biological parents are. I asked my parents and once again I get called ungrateful. I didn\u2019t know were to look from there. My roomie suggested one of those ancestry DNA tests to find a match. We did that and boom, I got into contact with my biological uncle via email and soon after that, phone. After that he told my biological mother about the situation. She freaked out. We met and it was an amazing experience. I love her and I want to make a point that this does not take away from the love I have for my adoptive parents. I just hate how they covered it up. I got to meet the rest of my bio family as well. Since my parents treated me as ungrateful for asking questions about my biological family I didn\u2019t tell them.  I did, however, recognize that I would need to tell them eventually. I knew they would be angry but it had to happen. I visit them every so often. Keeping this secret from them was starting to make me feel guilty so I decided to tell them yesterday. I texted my mom asking if I could come over for dinner. She said yes and I had a conversation with them with all my siblings present. This made me uncomfortable but if my parents found out, they would find out as well. It all started well. My dad stated how she was happy to see me come over to eat with them. Well, a few minutes later I told them. Their initial reaction was one of shock. My mom asked my siblings to go to their room so she and my father could talk to me alone. To my surprise, they weren\u2019t angry. They asked my why I did it. I told them the truth. Curiosity got the best of me. I thought my blood was theirs for 17 years and when I found out it wasn\u2019t, I had to find out where it comes from. They asked in what way could I forget everything they did for me and that family is more than blood connections. I told them I didn\u2019t forget. I was just angry at them for hiding the fact from me. My biological parents gave me up because they were poor and lived in a rural area with little opportunity for them. That actually made me more grateful for my parents.   My mom got really offended by this. How I could feel anger towards her was incomprehensible for her and my father. I told them it\u2019s best I should leave. My mom told not to come back until I learned some gratitude and learned to appreciate family. I\u2019m sorry for any typing mistakes I made. I\u2019m typing this at night and this is a stressful situation. AITA?",

He helped me repair my home after a major flood incident. I would say up until this point, our work for work exchange has been fairly equal to slightly tipping the scale in his favor. He recently decided to completely gut and remodel one of the rental homes. This project is expected to take 6 months or more. We anticipate remodeling several of the properties over the next few years. This is going to be a significant time and labor investment. We have talked about marriage and what a prenup might look like. He has been clear in that he wants to keep his rental properties as separate property if we were to get married. He has even gone as far to say that he would want the rental properties even separate from me in his estate planning/will and that everything would go to his sibilings. This has been alarming to me and quite hurtful. I understand he doesnt want to lose assets in the event we divorced but I truly don't understand the estate side of things. This detail makes a difference because we have a 13 year age gap and he would likely pass before me.  I have told him that if he wants to keep the rental business separate, that's fine... but I will no longer be volunteering my time to his business. Basically that I won't be his free labor slave girl to enrich him and his family. If he wants me to come work on remodeling the properties he will need to pay me as if I am an employee. I told him my pay rate would be $20 an hour. I have also suggested he call on his family to come help him. I am firm on this boundary right now. He is becoming resentful of my position on this.

        "selftext": "I (18F) am a carpool driver because of my sister Maya (13F) and brother Joey (8M). The carpool also includes Jenny (13F) (all fake names) who Maya used to be friends with, but the friendship ended after an argument over a group outfit.  Since that happened, Maya is saying that she wants Jenny out of the carpool. Her explanation was that being around her ex-friend is giving her anxiety since she knows Jenny doesn\u2019t like her anymore. I asked has Jenny been saying or doing anything to you? Maya said no, but she shouldn\u2019t have to sit next to someone who doesn\u2019t like her everyday. I need to back her up and stop driving Jenny in the carpool because I\u2019m her sister and not Jenny\u2019s  I explained that Jenny\u2019s mom obviously won\u2019t participate in the carpool if Jenny isn\u2019t allowed, which means Maya and Joey won\u2019t have an affordable way to school on Mondays and Fridays anymore. I also told Maya that she can listen to her music or talk to our brother on the ride as a distraction.  Maya kept arguing though and I was out of patience. So I told Maya that the fact is that not everybody\u2019s gonna like you and broken friendships are going to happen in life. She needs to get over it and I better not hear about her trying to start any issues with Jenny or her mom over this.  I\u2019m conflicted because of my parents. Dad feels bad because broken friendships at that age are still painful, and he said I was mean for not offering to work out something. But Mom is out of patience as well because they\u2019re already seated at opposite windows and Jenny isn\u2019t saying or doing anything. She said she approved of what I told Maya because she\u2019s not going to mess up the carpool and let them pay a ridiculous fee every semester just because she\u2019s uncomfortable. Is Dad still right that AITA and should have tried to work something out with Maya?",

        "selftext": "Apologies.. I want to include as many details as i can but I'm also staying vague for anonymity sake. My husband (36m) and his sister (38f) were born and raised in Africa. They immigrated to America as older teens/young adults, so they have no experience growing up in the U.S. Recently, my SIL was upset because her son (10m) has recently started asking to go by an American/English name. His name is a very traditional name from her and my husband's culture and it has no standard counterpart in English. Apparently my nephew has been teased for his weird name and just wants a normal name to fit in. She asked me what I thought because I grew up in the US with a foreign name.  I (35f) was born and raised in the U.S. to immigrant parents from an European country. My name is from their country/native language, but it has an English counterpart (think like Erzs\u00e9bet - Elizabeth) so I tended to use the American version in school so my classmates and teachers could pronounce it.  I told my SIL to let my nephew use the new American name/nickname so he wouldn't be teased. She got upset because his name has a lot of meaning and she doesn't want him to be ashamed of his background and culture. She said I wouldn't understand because my name came from a white country and we live in a fairly white area so people are more accepting of it. I just think that why he should be proud of his name and culture, kids suck and sometimes it's just better to go along to get along. That she let him use new name to not be teased and wait until he is more mature to understand why he should love his name. AITA for telling her that? EDIT (31 Jan): I don't know if people care or not but I have a small update I have to share because I am just so proud of my nephew!! He sat his mom down and showed her a list of names that he liked.  He showed her what they all meant and how the meanings related to his actual name, so that he would still honor his name's meaning. Isn't he just so smart?? My SIL was still against the idea lol, but she has warmed up to the idea of him going by his initials. Apparently a new friend of his sometimes refers to him by initials already.  I doubt there'll be anything worth updating after this. I wish we could have had a warm hallmark moment where my nephew teaches his bullies about his culture and everyone hugs it out at the end but alas, life is more complicated. This all has generated a lot of conversations between my husband and I, as well, since I recently found out I was pregnant, about raising mixed race/culture children in today's world.  Thank you to everyone who was kind enough to respond.  ",

This betrayal was a blow to me, because we had built a whole future together, even without children, something that as I was sterile I could never provide her, something that had never been a problem for us until she made a point of throwing it in my face when I caught them in the act to justify herself. My whole family knew about it and stood by me in the separation except my niece who was always very attached to both of us and especially to her, and said that I should forgive her,and although it hurt me to dislike I couldn't go on with the marriage. After the separation I was able to gradually rebuild my life and even found a new girlfriend who I will call jane (32) who has two adorable children, John (14) and Anne (6) and I love them as if they were mine. Four months ago I received the invitation to my niece's wedding and promptly accepted, Until she told me that she hoped that my ex-wife and I would be her best men at the wedding, I was shocked and I made a point of firmly saying that I could not accept the invitation and that if she was a bridesmaid I would not go to the wedding and much less enter together. She got upset and broke down crying, now my family is telling me that I'm being too hard and that I should do this for the sake of my niece, my girlfriend also seems guilty and said that it would be okay for a day but I don't think it's fair.

Things were fine at first but now I\u2019m losing my mind bc she\u2019s OBSESSED with cooking. At first it was kinda cool bc she would make these fancy meals and sometimes offer me some but now she\u2019s like doing it ALL THE TIME and it\u2019s driving me nuts. She cooks literally every day, sometimes twice a day, and it\u2019s never simple stuff. It\u2019s always these big fancy recipes that use like every pot and pan we own. The kitchen is always a disaster and she doesn\u2019t even clean up after herself right away. Like sometimes I\u2019ll go to bed and the next morning there\u2019s still dirty dishes and random food everywhere. Also, she\u2019s started making weird stuff like fish stock and some kind of fermented stuff and it makes the WHOLE apartment stink. The fridge is also a huge issue. She\u2019s completely taken over all the space with her leftovers and jars of sauces and random ingredients. I can barely fit my milk and eggs in there. Last week I came home starving after work and she was making this huge meal and she told me I had to wait like TWO HOURS to use the stove bc she needed it for \u201cher process\u201d or whatever. I ended up eating cereal. So I told her she needs to chill and stop hogging the kitchen all the time and at least clean up after herself.

        "selftext": "Hi everyone, I just got into a huge fight with my wife regarding attendance of conflicting events. Her best friend is getting married later this year (east coast), and has told us the dates for about two months now, and we were definitely planning on going (apart from the fact that my wife is the maid of honor). This is a smaller wedding of around 60 people so only people who her friend REALLY wanted to attend got an invite. A few days ago, I was told by my family that we were going to have our grandma's 100 year birthday party on the same day in the west coast. I thought this was a no brainer and I said if this was any other birthday, I would skip it, but this is to celebrate her 100th, and I would like to attend the big party and she can go to her friend's wedding. Literally the whole family would be there (except her - and my family understands she had a prior obligation) , and many families are travelling from overseas to be in attendance. My wife is very upset that I had rsvp'ed earlier and that now I'm backing out of attending the wedding. I can't really see what the big point is, since we can each attend the event we find more important to our individual lives. Her main points are * There are so many people attending the party, they won't even know you aren't there* You committed to wedding earlier than this event (tbh i didnt even know the party until a few days ago)* The fact that I was invited to the small wedding means so much to her friend and would make her sad if I didn't go and were not part of the pictures (I was part of the must attend list)* Parents told me to attend if you can which gives me a pass for not going and not hurting anyone's feeling* We are a unit so we should be seen together at these big events so it's gonna be weird that I'm alone at my thing and she's alone at her thing My main points are: * I like your friend but I'd prefer to celebrate 100th birthday with which is a milestone for not only my grandma but also for my family* I don't like my wife thinking for her friend* I want to attend the family event (i feel like this trumps everything all her points) IDK - I feel like it's a no brainer but she absolutely lost her shit over this and I don't feel like I did anything wrong so i can't even force myself to like try to console her (maybe I'm the asshole for this). Anyways AITA? ---------- wow so many comments - CLARIFICATIONS / FAQ  - 1. I have not said yes to the party - this discussion is still ongoing but I want to go to the party2. When my folks told me about the party I did say let me get back to you but honestly I completely forgot about the existence of the wedding when I waltzed in and dropped the bomb on my SO3. I live in east coast but extended fam lives in west coast4. Rescheduling the party is not an option. Elders have a set date near the actual birth date and a LOT of people are involved.5. Why didn't you know it was her bday when you RSVP'ed. I agree I should have known and I wish I had remembered but we were discussing the invite wife was excited / stressed about all of the MOH things she had to plan and do and I RSVP'ed without thinking harder6. She did apologize about the grandma remembering stuff and said it was out of anger - she is a sweet person so I'm going to remove it ----------- UPDATE: Thanks so much for all of the comments and perspectives - I see where I was the AH to my wife and not be aware or considerate about the amount of stress of being MOH entails. Her job was to ensure that her best friend's day is the best that it can be, and also she was expecting me to be there so it was just the perfect stress storm. For the reconciliation process - I just laid out what I would like to do which is a different than my usual approach (I like to give wife options and she can choose. She has to choose enough already so it was an attempt on my end to lesson her burdens) 1. Facetime the bride immediately after the conversation and explain the situation and timeline of events.2. Go on a double date to a restaurant that they had on their list for a while3. Go with my wife on the morning of the wedding when they start to do all the prep and congratulate her on her wedding, and then take a flight to the west coast. I'll be a little late to the birthday but it's ok. Wife was still not too happy that I was going to no be at the actual wedding, but understood that things come up and agreed with my plan. She was upset that I didnt remember that it was my grandma's birthday month and there could have been a potential celebration.",

        "selftext": "AITA? Repost cause it got deletedThrowaway because I don't use reddit, just lurking. I want to preface this by saying two things. I am not a native English speaker, so I apologise for any weird phrases or wrong words. Second, and important to my story;I am legally blind. I have RP (retinitis pigmentosa) and in addition ~-4 on both eyes. I am able to type this with both the speech to text function and other various helping functions.In real life I wear a cane but otherwise I am independent. Now,i say this, not as an excuse, but to justify and underline my side of this story. I (f24) recently started dating for the first time. I didn't know how to get into it, so my friend suggested her putting me up on a blind date (haha) and I agreed.She gave me his (m26) name, and we agreed when and where to meet.It was a nice and warm day, although a little snowy, so I decided to get there a little early incase it would be hard to navigate myself.I found the restaurant (I've been there before) and sat down at the booked table. The guy shows up and we start chatting. I pick up a slight accent, and ask where he is from.Now here is where I might be the AH due to my phrasing.He laughs and tells me he's localAnd I giggle and push it a little more saying haha no I can tell you're not from here.The guy stops laughing, silently gets up and leaves.Im confused, and sit there for a few minutes waiting, incase I misunderstood the situation and he went to the watercloset or something, but he doesn't come back, so I pay for the drinks and cancel the food, before getting up and walking out.  I call the friend who set us up once I'm home, and she tells me he thought you acted like such an asshole. I was apparently rude as fxxk, racist and was looking at anything but him during the conversation. I am so confused  The last part I can understand, as me being blind makes it hard to understand what om looking at, but the rest leaves me super confused.  Here's where I could be the AH. My friend also explained to me in our call that he is from the same country as me (although from the part where they also speak another language) but he is darkskinned and adopted from birth. Have I accidentally said something racist?  AITA?  Tl;Dr, I was called a racist and I do not understand why ",

        "selftext": "Some background: I (29F) used to know Tom (30M) years ago. We were acquaintances as teenagers, and though we briefly dated at 16, it wasn\u2019t serious, and we stayed on neutral terms whenever we ran into each other. A few years later, when we were in our early twenties, I bumped into him at a nightclub, and he introduced me to his then-girlfriend, Alex. From the moment we met, Alex was noticeably cold toward me she barely spoke, made passive-aggressive comments about my appearance, and created an uncomfortable tension. Sensing the awkwardness, I made my exit. Tom later messaged me to apologize for how she acted, but I brushed it off. I didn\u2019t think much of it, as we weren\u2019t close anyway. Since then, I\u2019ve occasionally run into them at different social events, and Alex\u2019s attitude toward me has never changed. She has made snide remarks in passing, whispered about me to others while I was nearby, and has generally gone out of her way to be hostile anytime we\u2019re in the same space. I\u2019ve always ignored it because, as far as I was concerned, whatever problem she had with me wasn\u2019t my issue. Now to last weekend, I was out with some friends when I saw Alex and Tom at the same venue. Tom came over to say hello and make small talk, and almost immediately, Alex stormed over. Without even greeting me, she shoved her ring in my face and made a pointed comment about how I \u201cdefinitely couldn\u2019t have him now.\u201d I laughed and told her I never wanted him in the first place, but I was happy for them. That only made things worse. She started raising her voice, accusing me of trying to get attention for years, making assumptions about me, and throwing out personal insults. When she finally finished, I asked if she was done and told her that I had never done any of the things she was accusing me of. I also made it clear that I didn\u2019t care about her or Tom and, most importantly, that she needed to stop making her personal insecurities my problem. She looked like she was about to respond, so I added that she also needed to stop being jealous of me because there was no reason for it. At that point, she excused herself and left the room, with Tom following after her. Before he left, he told me I didn\u2019t need to say all that. My friends thought my response was blunt but justified, while some mutuals later told me I was too harsh and should have been more understanding because she\u2019s obviously insecure. Now, I\u2019m wondering was I too harsh?",

(For context now, we had a child together in our relationship and we are both currently in new relationships. His new girlfriend is pregnant with his second child.) Recently I received a message from my ex asking for a stone carved pregnant elephant that was gifted to me by his great grandmother 5 years back. His grandmother sadly passed a year back and he is currently asking for it back. I asked him firstly why he wanted it back as it was a gift for me during my pregnancy. A bit more context, we visited his family and his grandmother had elephants everywhere in her home. I made a comment about how beautiful her collection was, as some of them were very unique. She lit up and insisted I take one as a \u201cwelcome to the family\u201d present. I tried to politely tell her I would feel horrible to break up her collection but she kept insisting. At this point I didn\u2019t want to be rude and said okay and walked around with her as she told me stories of how she got some of the elephants. Anyways, we stumble upon the stone carved elephant with a carved out tummy with a baby inside. She heavily implied that my choice should be that specific elephant as it fits the situation perfectly (me being pregnant and all at the time.) I smile and accepted and thanked her for letting me carry apart of her collection with me. She gave me a hug and accepted me into part of the family. My ex (who I guess got a bit jealous) wanted to pick out an elephant of his own, so he got to do so. Back to current day. He told me, due to the passing of his grandmother, he wanted to have the elephant to put with a gift he got with his great grandfather so that they could both be together. When I asked him why he specifically wanted mine, he kept dodging the question and said it belonged to his grandmother and it being a gift from her to me held no value. I reminded him that he got to choose his own that day, he dodged that too. Calling me selfish and a lowlife. Part of me is more than willing to give it back to him but part of me knows that he is going to gift this elephant to his new girlfriend because of her new pregnancy. (I say this because I know his narcissistic and manipulative personality.) Why would he ask me NOW and not a year ago upon her passing?  AITA? UPDATE: I looked at the price of the elephant online, it\u2019s made from jade and have seen some sold for 200-400$ online. Money might be his key factor in getting it back",

(I live like 5-10 mins away from the mall so it's no problem). I told her we any ways have to go because my coworkers need help.  I told her we can hang at the mall for a bit if she's down. Any ways we were passing the ice cream place and I told her I'm grabbing some for my self and I asked her if she's sure that she does not want any. She said she's good and thanked me for offering. We're browsing the mall and she tells me the ice cream actually looks really good if she could have a lick. I told her if she really wants it I'll get it for her no problem. But she said she just wants to try it from mine. I told her I'm not comfortable with that but the offer still stands about me getting her an ice cream. She got annoyed and said Why are you being such an AH about this I don't want a whole damn ice cream I just want a lick from yours. I told her again I'm not comfortable with that. I'm just very weird when it comes to sharing food where spit could easily be exchanged, unless I'm very close with the person and I'm at a certain level of trust with them for example my mom or my brother. Like I could be good friends with some one but still not be comfortable sharing those types of food with them. My friend and I are just good friends from college that is all. So AITA? I mean I still offered to buy her an ice cream as an alternative.",

        "selftext": "When my husband and I got married, his parents (divorced but still best friends) bought us a house as a wedding gift. I think it\u2019s relevant to say that my husband and I have been together since we were in highschool and his parents are good friends of my family. My FIL has been remarried since my DH (Lee) was in middle school, and his new wife, let\u2019s call her Patty, brought along a daughter Lee\u2019s age into the marriage. I\u2019ll call SIL Eli for simplicity\u2019s sake.  Eli has always had a involved dad and doesn\u2019t have a father daughter relationship with FIL. Her dad is well to do, but has five other kids so he\u2019s not able to be as generous as my FIL is with Lee who\u2019s an only child. Eli\u2019s getting married in a month and she came over out of the blue yesterday to rant because she \u201cfound out\u201d that FIL isn\u2019t getting her and her fianc\u00e9e Dora a house for their wedding present. Lee and I listened to her and Dora\u2019s rant, but Lee got upset and had to excuse himself after Dora started mentioning that FIL might be homophobic. I told them plainly that they were being ungrateful because FIL is covering their two month long honeymoon expenses and paying for a portion of their wedding- he only did the latter for Lee and I. I also added that FIL and MIL paid for the house TOGETHER, so it wasn\u2019t all him. And that Patty didn\u2019t help whatsoever despite being Lee\u2019s stepmom, but that\u2019s not relevant I guess? Dora and Eli both got mad at me and said I was defending a bigot, and stormed out, and since then I\u2019ve been \u201casked\u201d not to come to the wedding. Patty sided with Eli and is now not on good terms with my FIL, who\u2019s upset and feels like his contributions aren\u2019t being appreciated. So AITA for telling my SIL that she\u2019s not owed a house? Edit: forgot to add. Eli and Dora\u2019s only been together for a year and a half. They decided to get engaged spontaneously at Patty\u2019s thanksgiving dinner. FIL disapproves of Dorothea\u2019s profession (she\u2019s a stripper), but has never outwardly shown it I wasn\u2019t sure if it was relevant to bring up their past but based on a few comments i think it is. Eli and Dora\u2019s relationship started when they met at Dora\u2019s job. The one year and a half has been a sugar mommy/baby dynamic but Eli\u2019s expressed it\u2019s \u2018serious\u2019.  FIL and I are close and he privately told Lee and I that he doesn\u2019t think they\u2019re in it for the long run",

        "selftext": "This isn't on my main acc as I want genuine opinions I (34 F ) and husband (37 M) and stepmom (52 F) My stepmom has been helping us out by babysitting my 2 children (2 and 5) and while me and my husband are very grateful, we are very upset with her. My stepmom recently was divorced by my father. My stepmom had no where to go so she had asked to stay with us. I hadn't had a great relationship with her for stealing stuff I had bought with my money when I was 17 however I decided to push past this and move on. When she moved in, we went over rules and told her what her experience would look like. She agreed to our rules, which included buying food for herself when necessary, although we did tell her we would mostly be buying stuff for her so she could get back on her feet.  Another rule we had was babysitting. We would agree to pay her for babysitting our kids when we needed her so that she could make some money to get back on her feet. We gave her our job contact info had she ever needed to call them if she couldn't get ahold of us while we were at work. Recently, we haven't really been needing her to babysit but she has been insistent on paying for food items. We went over the fact that this wasn't needed and she replied that she wanted to feel like she had more power over us by paying for food. I gently reminded her that this was our house and she was a guest in it to which she got pissed. She told me and my husband that she has power over us and how she was my mom. I didn't reply and just stopped talking to her. My husband had made plans with her that we would need her to babysit our kids this past Monday and she had agreed to it since we were both going to work. I am at work when my work receives a call from my husband telling me that my stepmom called him saying that she was leaving to go party with her friends, and he was going back home to talk to her. I agree that he is doing the reasonable thing since she has no concept of responsibility.  I then, while at work receive a call from my stepmom who had said that my husband said that she needed to grow up and gain responsibility or get out. I, of course sided with my husband and she hung up. The next morning, whilst driving home I noticed my stepmoms car wasn't in my driveway and I asked my husband about it, to which he replied she chose to get out. I have been trying to reach my stepmom for days but she nor my step-sister (whom she moved in with) will hold a conversation with me and my stepmom will not apologize. I'm starting to feel like the AH since neither of them will respond to me. Did I overreact and overstep for basically kicking her out? EDIT 1: I disliked her when I was 17, didn't really talk to her and then decided to give her another chance based on step sis who had a problem similar to mine which stepmom was able to apologize and grow from. The original reason she moved in with me and not step sis is because she is having a rough time paying the rent, also we would pay stepmom and she wouldn't.",

        "selftext": "This is my first time posting so sorry for any mistakes. My husband Jack (33M) and I (28F) have a toddler together and have another one on the way. He's a stay at home and I work full time. I'm out of the house the majorty of the day while he's home with the toddler.  Jack doesn't do anything. He never sets an alarm to get up with the toddler. I do. He sits in the living room until our toddler's nap (which varies every day) then goes to the basement to play his video games. Our toddler will sleep anywhere from 2 to 3 hours. Then once our toddler wakes up, he gets her, makes dinner, and maybe gets one chore done around the house. Almost every day he does this. There are some days when I'm pleasantly surprised.  I've talked to Jack multiple times about keeping the house cleaned, but he claims it's not fair that I don't have to do anything (which isn't true). If the house is kept up on, I do dishes, laundry, and meal prep on my days off. Sometimes I'll bake too. I'll also be on toddler duty. However once he lets the house go, I don't do anything other than clean the areas my toddler is in so she's not affected by it because she deserves a clean house.  I have (almost) gotten the house completely cleaned 3 times now, and he lets the house go. I've tried splitting chores, but again, it's hard when I work full time and I'm out of the house the majorty of the day. My job has me on my feet all day and some days are harder than others. I tell Jack all the time (and have proven it sometimes) that if the roles were reversed, I'd have the house cleaned for him. Jack claims that's not true. He claims it's my fault that the house is trashed because I should do more, yet I work full time because he didn't want to work, which I supported and made more sense financially. I have also been really tired and just want to sleep due to my pregnancy, but Jack gets mad if I don't wake up in the morning, even though I let him sleep in most mornings. I know how Reddit can be, which is why I didn't want to post, but I'm at my wits end. We literally had another fight about the house being trashed and instead of helping me clean like I asked, he's now working in the garage. (Jack will literally find other things to do other than clean the house. For example, if there's a task that needs to be done, he'll take all day to do it, even if it's an hour long job). So AITA for expecting my husband to clean the house? Should I be doing more?",

        "selftext": "I (f29) have always had a pretty close relationship with my mom. We lived about an hour from each other which I know isn\u2019t far, but we both had our own homes and lives. I always called her for everything, she used to ask me to go out and have like dinner or go see a movie etc.. we were pretty close up until this.. Growing up, my mom made a lot of mistakes. DON\u2019T think I\u2019m not grateful for my mom, I am.. but she had a terrible gambling addiction, owed REAL bad people money, moved close to 10 times between the ages of 7 to about the time I was 18 due to evictions or mortgage foreclosures.. and has been into hard drugs in and out throughout my life.  May of 2023, I call my mom and ask her about what we should do for Mother\u2019s Day and/or her birthday (her birthday is a week after Mother\u2019s Day, and we normally just celebrate one or the other). Knowing she worked her birthday, I had asked her if she would like to do something on Mother\u2019s Day instead since I work later swing shift, and could do something before i work. She proceeds to tell me she has the day off, and I was shocked. I ask her how, and she goes \u201cI quit I don\u2019t work there anymore\u201d obviously I was confused asf and asked for more, and she gave me a bullshit story. Later in the next few months, I find out that she actually got fired, for doing drugs in the parking lot at her job.  I\u2019ve tried throughout the rest of this time (until recently) to get her to talk to me about this or get her help with like a rehab or anything like that. She\u2019s never been interested in getting help. She hadn\u2019t worked since May of 2023 now. All she does is stay at home, do drugs, and call me at 3am with random shit that she\u2019s hyped up about and tell me all the projects she\u2019s doing and stuff about her dogs. It breaks my heart that she\u2019s still trying to update me in her life and what she\u2019s doing but I can\u2019t stand to talk to her now\u2026  As of a week ago, I found out that my mom is now so far behind on her mortgage.. that it\u2019s going into foreclosure. Her and her also drug addict husband (at least he has a good paying job) are trying to scrounge up the money to buy their home back from the bank. He makes a good amount of money, but clearly they haven\u2019t been spending their money on the damn mortgage. They owe 178k still on the mortgage, and need to get 6k to cover the late payments and whatever and then they need to  apply for the loan.  My mom calls me and asked me if I could borrow her the money. I told her how could I trust that that money would be going to the mortgage and not her drug addiction. She tells me \u201cidk what you\u2019re talking about\u201d like she always has said throughout my life. I tell her no, I won\u2019t give her the money. She cries to me, begging me to give her the money or she\u2019s going to lose her home.. I tell her to get a job, and I hung up the phone. I start to explode with tears because I\u2019m so heart broken and sad for her and I feel terrible for not giving her the money but\u2026 I just don\u2019t know what to do. AITA? ",

        "selftext": "I 16f live with my older sister 21f and both my parents. My sister is currently pregnant with twins and is due in April. Before my sister got pregnant we switched rooms which was a HUGE mistake on my part because I had to spend 4 hours cleaning HER room after we switched. Even though she told me to clean mine because she was \u201cgoing to clean hers\u201d. Now I should\u2019ve known better because I know her but you have to understand I am not being dramatic with 2 people it took my friend and I a little bit over 4 hours to get it livable for my standards. I had to shampoo the carpet 3 times for it to smell decent. Sorry I just need to get it across for this story to make sense.       Now the room I\u2019m in now had a bathroom that was previously broken because you\u2019ll never guess, my sister broke it! About 3 months ago we got it fixed. And 3 months ago now suddenly she\u2019s not going to be able to raise her babies upstairs because there\u2019s not enough room. Now my room is a little bigger than hers, but not by much. I have a smaller bed than she does so she would take up more space in this room than I would so that could also be why she feels her space is not big enough.       Now here\u2019s my issue her carpet upstairs is stained BAD the carpet is mostly fucking hard and it reeks of mold not to mention IM going to have to clean it. I\u2019m sorry but why should I be punished? I\u2019m not pregnant? I didn\u2019t do anything to deserve this? I know my parents won\u2019t clean it, or ask her to. Why should I have to clean up her mess AGAIN for a room I don\u2019t even want. There is stains all over the walls, and trash stashed in every corner because it\u2019s \u201cclean\u201d. Now I understand that after she gives birth it most definitely will affect her ability to walk upstairs where her room is, which is her new reason for us needing to switch rooms but not even two months ago she was sleeping in the living room because she couldn\u2019t walk upstairs which was weird because she switched back to her room upstairs?? I\u2019m not going to say anything because you know I\u2019m 16 I\u2019ve never been fucking pregnant before but that was just a little odd to me. But I really like my room I\u2019ve put in a lot of money time and effort into it and I don\u2019t really want to have to do it again, my mom tells me that she won\u2019t make us switch but I\u2019m worried my sister will guilt trip her into doing what she wants like always,but where I might\u2019ve been the asshole is when she asked me for the 2nd time she said I had already agreed to switch rooms which was not true. So, I got angry and told her I never agreed to that to stop making shit up and she\u2019d have to kill me to get this room from me. Which caused her to get angry and we started arguing so am I the asshole for refusing to switch rooms? ",

Luke is a foster kid and my son has been best friends with him since they were 6. Reed is actually my ex's biological nephew but we adopted him when he was 3.  We told the boys that they had a special surprise that they would get before school. Luke's parents dropped him off with his bag at my house and Randy picked both kids up. I told my son's teacher he'd be missing school and she thanked me because the less kids on a Friday before a holiday, the better. My ex called me up and asked why Reed wasn't at school. I said because he's at Disneyland with Uncle Randy and Luke. She said I should had asked her beforehand. I said, should had asked or told you. She said asked. I said his trip is on my custody time (one week on,one week off) so, no, I don't have to ask you permission. I don't ask you to ask me for permission when Reed goes on a sleepover. Plus Luke has never been to Disneyland and neither kid has stayed at $1,500 a night suite. I said maybe I should had told you, although we generally don't tell each about sleepovers but I'm not apologizing for not asking for your permission. I tried to understand her logic. She said she wasn't comfortable with non-relative adult taking Reed on a vacation. I said Randy is his uncle. She said you know what I mean. He really isn't. I said I wasn't going to continue this conversation with her and she can kiss my ass. Randy was family enough to accept money from him. The irony is that I've raised that kid more than her because I'm a remote worker who can do most of my job on my phone so Reed is growing up with a SAHD.",

I only found out who he was when I was 13 and even then he did not want custody of me forcing me to stay in the foster system until I was 18. Over my whole life I have had about 5 conversations with him give or take- he is like a stranger to me. He appears once in a blue moon to ask for money or something along those lines. It doesn't really bother me anymore, I've just learnt to accept it now but i don't like talking about it so to avoid that conversation with people i usually just say both my parents are dead. This leads me to a year and a half ago when I had just started dating my boyfriend (25M) and like usual I had just told him my parents were dead but the other day my dad showed up at my door (I still don't know how he knows where I live) and asked for 100 dollars except my boyfriend was there and he obviously found out my dad was not dead. This lead to a long conversation with him that night where I explained the whole situation. He said this was a breach of trust between us since I lied about my dad and that he needed some space to rethink our relationship but he doesn't think he will leave me. I feel so shitty and that I should have told him earlier but I am going to be honest I just didn't think. So AITA? UPDATE: my boyfriend texted me 5 mins ago asking to talk so we are going to have a full in depth conversation tomorrow after work and I'll update again then :)   UPDATE 2 (last update): Before I get to the update I would like clear things up. 1. I have only given money to my dad once when I was still desperate for his love and acceptance but he did not get any money this time. 2. Despite his confusion my bf stepped in to defend me and get my dad to leave and it was only after my dad left he asked me about it Now onto the update. My boyfriend told me that all the sudden information along with the knowledge I hadn't told him the truth was very overwhelming and he just needed some space to not say the wrong thing. He also said that he got why I lied initially and he wasn't mad that I lied more hurt that I felt like I couldn't tell him about it. He also mentioned that he couldn't be there for me if he didn't know what was going on. The conversation ended in tears and it is the most vulnerable I have been in front of someone. He was very understanding and we have decided to draw a line in the sand and 'start again' if that makes sense. I have also looked into therapy for my childhood trauma and all in all I am using this as an opportunity to better myself and heal fully. Thank you for all your kind comments :)",

So, basically, six months ago my gf invited me to a food festival in her hometown. The day I arrived, I learned that there was a hot-dog eating contest and the prize would be an $100 gift card to a large tech retail store. Being a casual competitive eater in college, I decided it would be a fun idea to enter and signed up on the website. When I told my gf\u2019s family I had entered the contest, my gf\u2019s dad good-naturedly clapped me on the back, and said \u201clet the best man win.\u201d Apparently, my gf\u2019s dad had won the hot-dog eating contest for the last 4 years, and was somewhat expecting to win again. Wanting the gift card, I decided to give the contest my all. I ate a bunch of hot dogs, I wasn\u2019t even paying attention to what I was doing, but by the time I was done, I\u2019d eaten 16 hot dogs in five minutes, beating my gf\u2019s dad, who only ate 12 hot dogs.\u00a0 When I was done, my gf\u2019s brother Liam (14M) and a bunch of his friends mobbed me, calling me \u201cThe Doggler\u201d, giving me high-fives and clapping me on the back. They said that I had dethroned The Doggler, pointing to my gf\u2019s dad, and that I was the new Doggler, that I was a real \u201cglizzied rizzler\u201d (or something like that) and that I was just shoving \u201cglizzy after glizzy down my gullet\u201d. They posed for pictures with me. It was weird but kind of fun.\u00a0 Later, my gf\u2019s dad came up to me, shook my hand, and said I was good competition. He went home to do something in his woodshop, so I hung out with my gf, Liam, and his friends, going around to various food stalls and games. When we all ate dinner that night, the hot dog contest didn\u2019t come up at all, except for when Liam kept referring to me as The Doggler and saying that he wanted to make a special Doggler shirt for me. We had a nice breakfast the next morning. No sign that anything was wrong. Today though, my gf brought up in our argument that her dad was actually really wounded by losing the hot-eating contest, but just didn\u2019t say anything to me. I said if I wasn\u2019t supposed to enter the contest, then was it really a contest at all? And she said that it was less about the contest but about the special Doggler shirt (Liam made his dad a Doggler shirt for the years he won the contest, but I got the Doggler 2024 shirt). She said that her dad only wanted to win the contest to connect with Liam and, if anything, I should be able to understand the masculine ego. So reddit, AITA? Edit: posted the shirt...

        "selftext": "I was appointed the personal representative of my friend/ex-spouse\u2019s estate, which includes a motorcycle. My 32-year-old daughter believes I should give it to her. I have two main reasons for hesitating. First, anything I sell from the estate must go toward settling debts and financing the remodeling of the property, which she is fully aware of. Second, she has a history of financial irresponsibility that I choose not to support. She hasn\u2019t adjusted her lifestyle despite past financial struggles and frequently points out that I have money because I travel internationally. For context, I am a retired, single 54-year-old woman. In the past, I made her an authorized user on my credit card to help her build credit, with strict instructions to use it only for emergencies and to be fully responsible for any charges. However, she once asked to charge a specific amount but exceeded it by $700. She made a few small payments, and I ended up covering the rest\u2014so when she charged $2,500 in July 2023, I insisted she repay it in full. She has only paid off about 50%, and for several months, she didn\u2019t make payments, citing financial difficulties. Her car was repossessed in August 2024, but she currently uses her partner\u2019s vehicle to get around. Before that, she relied on LA\u2019s transit system. She recently told me she doesn\u2019t want her live-in partner to work, which I found frustrating\u2014especially since she still owes me money. In my opinion, if you\u2019re struggling financially, both partners should be working. But ultimately, that\u2019s their choice. I told her that owing me money while simultaneously choosing to be in a one-income household felt like a slap in the face. Now, she wants me to gift her a motorcycle, even though I need to sell estate assets to settle debts. To top it off, she says she has surveyed her friends, and they all agree that I\u2019m being mean, unfair, and uncaring. Would I be the asshole for refusing? Update: Thank you for your comments and insight. I got it INTA, but it\u2019s past time for me to set strict boundaries.  Btw he isn\u2019t her dad and they had no relationship. She is no longer a user on any of my credit cards. ",

        "selftext": "ETA:My husband doesn\u2019t do gifts, his family was never big on gifts and it shows.  He requested I send links to things I want because he isn\u2019t creative to know what I want. He likes when I just tell him things \u2014 clear and direct. If I do not ask for a gift (birthday, Christmas, etc) I\u2019m not receiving anything. This happened in 2024. He asked me to pick an engagement ring out because he just couldn\u2019t decide. He TOLD ME HE WOULD BUY THIS NECKLACE 2 years ago, and I\u2019ve waited this long. I sent links, photos, we have walked through pandora together to see what it is I wanted. We are in couples counseling to work on communication and putting in effort since he struggles with it. He\u2019s well aware he struggles with this. So for everyone telling me to just buy it myself, it defeats the purpose of him saying he will buy it and requesting links to what I want. I thought about buying it myself for quite a while, but I have waited patiently for him to put in the effort and keep his word.  My husband (28m) and I(29f) have been married nearly a year now, and our anniversary is coming up soon. Ever since we have dated I have expressed how I\u2019d love a dainty initial necklace with the letter d to wear daily. Corny? Sure, but I love it. Anyway\u2026after a year of not receiving the necklace I started showing him pictures on Etsy of the ones I love (small gold plates with a lower case d in typewriter font \u2014 all of them were this font and style) we even walked through pandora to the custom engraved section and how he could write it and that would be very precious and meaningful to me. He thought it was neat and this whole time I thought he was absorbing what I was saying and listening. All he absorbed was the word \u2018dainty\u2019 apparently. This comes down to this morning. He expressed he was bored at work (night shift and he works for weeks at a time 1000 miles away from me). And this morning he bought a small (in size) but very thick bulky d necklace is some kind of frilly cursive that doesn\u2019t even look like a d. We share an email and I had literally opened it to check our daily emails like I do daily and it refreshed and there was the purchase. I texted him and expressed that it\u2019s absolutely nothing like I\u2019ve expressed for years. I\u2019ve waited this long for a necklace \u2014 I want to actually like and wear it. He told me I wanted dainty and that it is dainty, and I tried to explain dainty and delicate doesn\u2019t just mean in size and he googled it sent me the definition of dainty. I told him it was absolutely nothing like I\u2019ve shown him for years and to just cancel the order. Naturally this makes me ungrateful in his eyes. AITAH?",

        "selftext": "I (16M) have been told by my parents that I need to sleep in the basement to accommodate my younger cousins who are sleeping over for a week. My relatives have recently moved to where we are and they are still settling in, my family decided to help them by letting them stay over for a week or so. Our house isn\u2019t that big so I don\u2019t know why my parents even decided that, and FYI I am an only child. So it happens, they settle in our house but the problem is literally the entire house is cramped at this point. Luggage\u2019s and bags are everywhere, my uncle and aunt are sleeping in the living room, my cousin who\u2019s around the same age as me is sleeping in a small 1-person DIY guest bedroom (it\u2019s just a small unused room that barely has any space) and my 2 younger cousins are going to be sleeping in my room. Now, my room is also pretty small, combined with my desk, bed, closet, and more. Only 2 people can sleep in it, so my parents ask me to sleep in the basement and my aunt and uncle agreed. I flat out refused, our basement isn\u2019t the worse but it\u2019s dusty in there and cold. And even if I did, I had to sleep on an uncomfortable mattress with nothing but a thin blanket and a pillow probably and that would be super uncomfortable. I wouldn\u2019t want my younger cousins to go through that too but it was MY bedroom. I asked if I could sleep in my parent\u2019s room instead but as I said every room in our house is pretty small, my parents room is also filled with the different stuff they had when they moved. My parents got kind of pissed off at me and we had an argument. It ended up with me going over to a friend\u2019s house and sleeping there for the entire week my relatives were there. EDIT: I realized I didn\u2019t put enough info, sorry for that. But one, the basement is really cold now, even with a heater because I don\u2019t think the insulation done in our basement was ever done properly (?) and hence the reason why most of our unused stuff is down there because we barely go down there. Two, I\u2019m not allowed to take my own bedding with me, just an extra blanket which is thinner than my usual blankets + a pillow because my cousins are using them.",

        "selftext": "About 3 weeks agoI (50m) and my wife (46f) put up a basketball hoop in my driveway for my 12f and 10f children to practice basketball (they play on basketball teams).  I live in an HOA and checked the CC&Rs prior , found nothing in there restricting this.  Last week I got the following text:  \u201cJack\u201d, respectfully, may we get basketball quiet hours from 4-6pm on weekends and 4:30-6:30 on weekdays? The constant bouncing of the ball is very disturbing of our senior rest time in the late afternoon. Thanks for considering. \u201cJohn\u201d After again checking the county code and CC&Rs and consulting with my sister and friend (both attorneys), I wrote the following response a few days later: \u201cJohn\u201d,   I\u2019ve considered and discussed your request with my wife. While we want to be good neighbors and have met your prior requests, your current request for \u201cquiet hours\u201d during the late afternoon is unreasonably restrictive.  In reading the County Noise code section <x> (Noise Ordinance) and the CC&Rs, it appears that quiet hours as defined in the County code are 10pm-7am M-F and 10pm-9am Sat-Sun.  The CC&Rs document is silent on additional quiet hours beyond county code.  You\u2019re asking for a restriction on their prime playtime between school and dinner for your senior rest time.  I\u2019m somewhat sympathetic to your dilemma, since I work from home mostly. During business hours, I hear all manner of <neighborhood noises>.  I have found a set of noise canceling headphones very essential and effective. My children certainly don\u2019t play basketball daily and while I have not measured the sound pressure level inside the  house yet,  I have a hard time with thinking it approaches anywhere near 55 dBA limit as defined in the County Noise Ordinance.  Thank you for your understanding. Fairly quickly, that night I received this response: Wow, \u201cJack\u201d....Your response is  really over the top. We were simply asking for some neighborly consideration, and certainly not expecting a legal brief in response. The noises you describe do happen, are sporadic, and cease. The basketball is a constant bouncing on concrete under our bedroom and living areas, which is a completely different experience. Frankly, we were surprised the court was installed without the simple kindness of a conversation as our lot lines are very minimal.  The impact to our home enjoyment is substantial, and your suggestion that we live in headphones at the behest of your basketball whims is ludicrous. We are shocked at your unneighborly response, which is lacking in basic kindness. Consideration for the fact that we are over 70 and need some quiet periods to rest in our home is what we were seeking, as well as open rapport so that we may continue to enjoy our neighborhood together. The past 12 plus years have been a very pleasant experience for us. We wrongly assumed that you simply didn't realize the impact on our living space from your sport court and were opening a dialogue.",

She's always wanted to go, and talked about it for years but since she divorced my Dad (over a decade ago) hasn't had anyone to go with. My wife (27f) pointed out that once we have children, the chances of me going on a 3-week vacation alone will be pretty low and by the time our children grow up, my mother might be too old to travel long distances - so I told my Mom I wanted to go with her. She cried she was so happy.  The trip was booked for March. My wife has been nothing but supportive. Unfortunately, my wife and I have struggled to conceive. We have been trying for 2 years and moved country recently, away from my mother. I assured my mother the trip was still going ahead.  My wife and I recently had our first round of IVF and it failed. The doctors had been confident because my wife is still young but it didn't. My wife and I took this news hard - especially my wife. I won't go into the details but despite only being 27 my wife has some significant fertility issues. We found out that we are probably never going to have a child, even with IVF. My wife's mental health after the IVF failure declined and what made matters worse is the day we found out it failed, I had to go on a 2 week business trip. My wife was left on her own, in a new foreign country, with no family or friends, starting a new job, grappling with this awful news on her own. My wife lost weight and is now under supervision by a psychiatrist and psychologist and medicated daily.  When I came home I saw my wife was skeletally thin and struggling to get out of bed every day. Leaving her on her own is not an option for the foreseeable. I called my mother and explained the situ. I told her I wanted to delay our trip by 10 weeks so that my wife could finish her treatment and come with us. It was a win-win. My mother gets her trip, I'm still a good son but most importantly I don't abandon my wife. (Of course I offered to pay for all additional costs including new flights so my mother wasn't out of pocket).  My mother was initially supportive. She said she understood and thought the compromise was sensible. She even offered to come see us in our new country in March to give us support.  A week later, my mother called me and said she's disappointed about the trip being postponed and that we had let her down. She said with my wife coming that the trip would be different to what she expected. She said she can't handle the thought of it potentially being postponed again (we never said it would be) and no longer wanted to go on the trip at all. She said she never wanted to speak about the trip either. She cancelled the flights and asked my wife and I to refund her for everything, which we did. Once we paid her back, she stopped answering my texts. She hasn't once reached out to my wife (who she's known for 10+ years and knew how much children means to her) about the IVF, the trip - nothing. Or me.  AITA? ",

        "selftext": "AITA or is my partner just forcing me to conform to their principles & values? Hi all, I need some 3rd pov on this matter. For context, my partner & I have been dating for slightly under a year now but recently we had the stupidest fight I\u2019ve ever had in my entire dating life. My partner is a great cook and likes to cook for me. It helps that he is a non picky eater and eats everything and anything. For me, yes I admit I am picky but I do give things a try before totally deem the food items as likeable or eww.  So recently my partner made vegetable pancakes and included shiitake mushrooms in them. My partner knows that I absolutely hates it in any dish but he loves it so I don\u2019t mind if he puts it in \u2018cause when I eat it I\u2019ll just pick it out. I even provided alternative mushroom options for him to include (though by my preference I rather not have any mushrooms to be included but as a compromise & cos I love him so I force myself to accept alternatives) We kept having these repeated fights where he mentions that when I pick things out of my food, it makes my appreciation for his cooking as conditional? (let me just highlight I repeatedly thank him for cooking every time, hugs him and even do the dishes sometimes). It also shows that I have no table manners and I must be spoilt by parents while growing up, which makes me feel very frustrated and puzzled at the same time.  I don\u2019t do this in public settings or during family meals, only when it\u2019s just the 2 of us. During group meals I make a conscious effort to take a bite out of everything & only take repeated ones at the one I like. He said that if he ever did what I did when he was a child, his parents would have scolded him and thrown him out, which to me sounded like a trauma response & him projecting onto me.  I told him we\u2019re 2 consensual adults and I\u2019m not stopping him from putting in the mushroom but I just prefer not to eat it. I don\u2019t make him cook 2 different versions, I just force myself to eat it or I\u2019ll pick them out when I can. He refuses to let me pick them out and somewhat insists that I should follow him and be grateful that someone even bothers to cook for me, to which I feel that at this point I feel borderline suffocated to have to pretend to like some ingredient in a dish when I really really don\u2019t like it. So am I really the asshole? is there a way around this? ",

        "selftext": "Throwaway account.   So I (19F) took a gap year off of university after my first year for my health and also to earn some money. My aunt (42F) has two children 11M and 7F, and she asked if I could live with them and help her as an in help childcare, and she pays me for it.  I accepted, and have been staying with her and her husband (43M) for a few months now. Problems started because I realized that my nephew frequently picks on and bullies his younger sister. Ripping the heads of her stuffies, breaking her toys, ripping her drawings, etc. He frequently makes fun of her and is overall terrible to her. I have tried multiple different attempts to stop it, having a heart-to-heart with him, taking away his gadgets, grounding him, etc, but the behavior stops for a week at best before he starts again. His parents are not much help because my Aunt is always tired, she makes a lot from a demanding job and comes back and cleans up around the house, and makes dinner. My uncle comes back from work and doesn\u2019t contribute to the house chores in anyway, and when I brought up taking my nephew to therapy he dismissed it as \u2018pseudo science.\u2019 He is very averse to therapy. Now where the issue started, is I overhear my niece and nephew fighting again, and I immediately assume he\u2019s started something again and ask him to please give his sister a break. I learned that his sister was the cause of the fight this time, she poured water on his Nintendo switch, damaging it. I apologized for blaming him, and pulled her aside and asked her why she did it as she is not the type to do that. She said that she wanted her brother to stop picking on her and she wanted to get back at him. My Uncle comes home and says that I should give her the same punishment as his son to be fair, and was angry that I only made her write an apology letter to him, instead of grounding her or taking away her tablet. I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s fair to punish her the same way for her first offence, but he said that I was picking favorites and that he could see I was biased. So, am I the asshole? *edit, we are not blood related but basically grew up together and my mom and Aunt are practically family. I call them niece/ nephew because I always have tbh \ud83d\ude2d sorry English is not my first language \ud83d\udc80*",

They were excited about the free food (we are in college) and ate some putting the rest in the fridge.

        "selftext": "I\u2019m 38 year old physically disabled male currently living in a group home until I can regain my mobility and independence. Over the past year of so I\u2019ve developed a friendship with another resident who isn\u2019t great at managing their money. I\u2019m the type of guy who likes helping people and people go to seeking advice or at least support. Over that time I loaned him about $600. He\u2019d make some payments but often ask for that amount back within a week. I eventually put my foot down and stopped loaning him money.  Then one of his three daughters was killed, then the second died from an illness. I gave him more money in loans and gifts to help him with these extraordinary times. I probably loaned him about $150 and gave him $100 for travel to see his family and help with a headstone and flowers. A week ago his last remaining daughter\u2019s son died of COVID and I gave him another $110 loan for travel and funeral expenses but he still wants more. I\u2019m on fixed income right now and will probably be for at least the next year and a half. I\u2019ve basically written this money off in my mind but I feel I can\u2019t just keep throwing money to him. Right now he wants money for dress clothes or says he won\u2019t go to his grandsons services. It\u2019s tearing his daughter up and it feels like the emotional blackmail he\u2019s used against me before when he keeps telling me a true friend would help. My family say I\u2019m in the right cutting him off but it hurts my heart. I just need people unconnected to the situation to give me their opinion. Thank you all for reading this and your thoughts  Update: Thank you all for your kind words and the reality checks on if these deaths are real. It\u2019s funny how those happened after he couldn\u2019t manipulate me in other ways. He is cut off. I do have records of what he owes me but I\u2019ll never get it back. I\u2019ll just have to think of it as good karma and a lesson but try not to let it harden my heart just make me smarter in who I believe. I still want to be the loving caring guy I am just not so trusting. It\u2019s something I\u2019ve done many times before and helped a lot of people but been burned a lot too. I get told much of what you all told me by friends and family but I need it from people who don\u2019t know me for me to believe it\u2019s true and not just something they have to say.

        "selftext": "Last year, I (19F now) celebrated my 18th birthday on January 5th. In the Philippines, this is a debut,\u201d which is similar to a quincea\u00f1era. It was a huge event for my family, especially since everyone was already together after New Year\u2019s. I had professional photos taken for the occasion, but I also wanted a special picture with my cat on the special day. I have a male orange tabby who was once a stray and is now fixed, named Tang. He\u2019s a huge part of my life, and I always keep him inside the house unless I\u2019m with him.   On my debut, I was looking for Tang to take that special photo, but I couldn\u2019t find him anywhere. I started panicking because he\u2019s an indoor cat and never goes far. I asked my cousins to help me look for him, but it was difficult as there's a lot of orange strays in the area. Eventually, my cousin (25M) came up to me and said he had found him. He pulled what looks to be meat out of a bag, and my heart dropped, I thought he had killed my cat. I completely broke down, crying and freaking out in front of everyone. (As much as I hate it, both dog and cat still get butchered for meat here but hidden away from the authorities) As it turned out, my cousin was pulling a prank. What he had was actually rabbit meat to be cooked for my birthday (rabbit meat also made me fully uncomfortable. I didn't eat that dish.) It just seriously looked like a cat's anatomy and it freaked me out. I found out that he had taken Tang to my uncle's without asking me because my family thought Tang was \u201cgetting in the way\u201d while food was being prepared for my party. I was furious. I yelled at my cousin, told him to return Tang immediately, and demanded that he leave the celebration. He left, I was upset but I didn't let it bother me as Tang was safe. Fast forward to this year. I didn\u2019t want my cousin at my birthday party because of what happened last year, and I made that clear to my parents. Despite this, my aunt insisted that I was being dramatic and said my cousin should be allowed to come. He showed up uninvited, I confronted him and told him again that he wasn\u2019t invited. He told me to take a joke and that it was in the past. I snapped and told him I didn\u2019t ever want to see him again. My aunt jumped in, calling me a \u201cbig bitch\u201d and accusing me of being narcissistic for making my birthday about myself. (ISN'T IT SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT MYSELF?) The argument escalated until my dad and granddad stepped in. My aunt and cousin eventually left, but it didn\u2019t end there. A few days later, my aunt started posting in the family group chat, calling me rude, difficult, and selfish. That I couldn't take a joke or that I don't know how to forgive and that I will be sent to hell. She claims that I ruined my debut and this year\u2019s birthday celebration with my behavior.

        "selftext": "Throwaway for privacy. (Edit: Update posted at the bottom) So I (24F) work at a high school with my co-workers Carrie (29F), Leslie (26F) and Marissa (30F). All of us get along well, we eat lunch together everyday and go out for drinks to destress from work lol. Leslie and Marissa are a lot closer to Carrie than I am for context. Two weeks ago, Carrie made a group chat with our co-workers for her 29th birthday party but I wasn\u2019t included. I didn\u2019t know until Leslie asked me what present I was buying for Carrie. When I told Leslie that I didn\u2019t know about the party, she asked me if I was arguing with Carrie. Honestly I wasn\u2019t mad about not being invited. Me and Carrie aren\u2019t that close and she can choose whoever she wants as her birthday guests. Leslie told me the date and place of Carrie\u2019s party but I didn\u2019t plan to go because I don\u2019t want to be rude and come uninvited. Last Saturday was Carrie\u2019s birthday. I sent her a happy birthday message and hope that she enjoys her day. Carrie said thank you and we had a small conversation about her plans. I didn\u2019t get an invite from her so I decided to stay home. On Sunday, I got some text messages from Marissa that went like this: Marissa: \u201cHey why didn\u2019t you go to Carrie\u2019s bday party last night?\u201dMe: \u201cOh I\u2019m not in her group chat so I thought that I wasn\u2019t invited\u201dMarissa: \u201cdidn\u2019t Leslie tell you where it was? You could\u2019ve shown up\u2026\u201dMe: \u201cYeah but Carrie didn\u2019t invite me, I don\u2019t want to be rude by coming without her knowing\u201dMarissa: \u201cBut still we\u2019re coworker besties\u2026 you should\u2019ve asked Carrie if you could go\u201dMe: \u201cIf Carrie wanted me at her bday she would have told me. We talked yesterday morning\u201d (convo ended there) Today\u2019s now Friday (5 days since then) and the three of them completely avoid me. We used to eat lunch together in the staff lounge but now they eat in Carrie\u2019s classroom. And whenever I pass one of them during morning duty they just stare and ignore. The past few days were really rough and I\u2019ve cried during my lunches because they were my support system since I started teaching. I genuinely thought we were friends but now I\u2019m just rethinking about everything. AITA for not going? \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Update: Earlier today I sent a message to both Leslie and Marissa telling them how I felt. Leslie left me on read. Marissa sent me this text in verbatim: \u201cOkay is that how you feel? After everything that I did to help you when you were struggling? Dont talk to me at work\u201d Later Carrie asked if she can call me. According to her, Leslie texted the group chat that I was going (even though I wasn\u2019t invited??). So Carrie reserved a spot for me at her birthday dinner. When I didn\u2019t show up, Carrie took it as me ghosting her. She was upset and told everyone else what happened, hence the silent treatment. I told her that I never got an invite and our previous conversation didn\u2019t imply that I was attending. We kept talking for a bit and in the end Carrie needed some time to think about the situation. Will I continue being friends with them? \u2026No. I\u2019ll be cordial but keeping it strictly work-related. I\u2019ll have to find some better friends. \ud83e\udee0 **TLDR**: Coworker planned a party that I wasn\u2019t invited to. I chose not to go, but another coworker lied that I was attending. Everyone thought I bailed out and gave me the silent treatment. Lesson learned, don\u2019t trust some of your coworkers. Workplace drama is not worth it.",

Very busy bees and it's been a minute since I've done the puppy thing and never two together its been an adjustment.  We discussed before hand and I had very specific conditions, namely regular walks and we had to commit to training so they'd be well adjusted and we could travel with them easily.  My partner was very on board so we adopted towards the end of last year and started puppy classes within a week. Our initial puppy coarse was 6 weeks long and by week 4 they were miffed about going and sacrificing their Saturday mornings.  By the last week they were glad it was finally over, I took over doing the homework with both pups by week 4 because it irritated them. The pups weren't picking things up fast enough for them so I thought it would be better for the pups for me to take over. They did 1 walk and complained because the puppy was weaving around and not walking at heel properly so I've taken over those aswell, we have started basically obedience now and I'm training both.

She also said EBV is not contagious and she got it from a raw vegetable. I paid for my nails and was asked to donate her the money for her personal needs. I (30f) found a good manicurist (Nina, fake name) a few months ago. I\u2019ve been to her salon 4-5 times. Sadly, the Nina (40f) has Multiple sclerosis and EBV and she needs stem cells transplantation. She is planning on opening a charity fund, because she cannot afford to pay for that - 50kThis is all very sad and I wanted to help her once fund is set up, of course. The thing is, the last time I went to the salon, Nina asked me to give her money ($50) because she couldn\u2019t pay her bills. I of course sent her the money, I felt really bad for her and didn\u2019t hesitated for a second. BUT. Almost a week after, she called me and asked for ($300) because apparently she has mistaken an amount of the bill for which I sent her the $50 in the first place. I couldn\u2019t send her that much money and offered to give her $50 again and she said \u201cOkay\u201d. I felt weird because I\u2019ve been to the salon a few times, we\u2019re not friends or anything and I don\u2019t think is okay to call your clients and ask for money. She also called a friend (30f) of mine, who went to Nina\u2019s salon as well and Nina asked her for $300 too. After that I cancelled my appointment and went to a new nail salon. (Keep in mind, I\u2019ve been at her salon just 5 times!) The manicurist called me to ask what\u2019s wrong and I said that it\u2019s not okay for me to be asked for money (twice) and I understand that she\u2019s in a difficult situation, but that\u2019s not the way to earn money. She said I\u2019m an a-hole and I can afford to help her and I\u2019m insensitive.  Also I want to mention that at the moment there is no charity fund and I would\u2019ve help with donations once it\u2019s set up. Am I wrong?",

It looked like she was browsing the aisle endcaps. As I was next in line, she walked in front of me, slammed her Costco card down, and turned away. I was confused and an elderly couple nearby also looked shocked. Therefore, I politely said the line was here, and I did not care that she was leaning on a box nearby.

She just backed away and kept calling it rude. Finally, the pharmacist came out and basically asked what was the problem and separated us. I got to hand in the form and took a seat.

I have a friend, who i will call Lara (25F), and she unfortunately has a problem with punctuality. She has a tendency to be at least 20 minutes late, but there have been times where she has even been 40-50 minutes late. This is not due to traffic, but because she starts getting ready late and goes out of the house 5 minutes before our agreed time if not later. I have told her multiple times that i do not appreciate it. For example, I have sat alone in a restaurant for half an hour to make sure we did not lose the reservation. And this is just one of the situations which leave me frustrated. Other than that, she is a good friend and we have Lots of fun hangouts together. Well yesterday evening it was very cold and windy outside (1 Degree Celsius), and we had planned to meet in the city centre and go for food and drinks afterwards. I had texted her to remind her to leave her house on time. It takes me around 40 minutes to get there, so I cannot spontaneously just exit the house and be there, I have to plan my time. When I arrived, I was right on time (as opposed 10 minutes earlier, because I know it\u2019s useless with her anyway) and I started waiting. After around 30 minutes I lost my patience, texted her to forget it and just left. I was cold and in a bad mood, especially because she told me that she would be there \u201cright away\u201d. She apparently was there 15 minutes later and called me upset, that I don\u2019t understand how she is and I am being a bad friend. That I should not make plans if I am not okay with waiting, which I did not agree with. Still, I have never left like this before and I feel guilty for leaving her like this. Was I the asshole? Little update I have left in the comments: She called me a few hours ago, and we talked for a bit. She apologized for insulting me, ignoring my messages AND for being late this time. She sounded like she really regretted it, but I was a bit bitter about the fact that I had to take it this far for her to wake up. I did not talk about meeting up again, as I just want to let it sink in a bit more and not just two days. And I think afterwards I will use one of the suggestions that said to meet in a cafe and give her a range, such as \u201cI will be here from 15 to 15:30\u201d, and see how that works out. I truly don\u2019t want to lose her and I was sorry to hear her like this, but she hurt me first and she needs to understand that too",

        "selftext": "Hi! Sorry for the weird formatting since this was done on mobile + on a throwaway account since I don\u2019t want my family finding this out. I\u2019m really desperate for the insight of people who don\u2019t know me and aren\u2019t biased. My parents 54m and 56f have shared custody of me, 16f, so I stay one week in my dad\u2019s house and a week in my mom\u2019s house. My dad and mom both remarried, mom married Josh, 57m and dad married Alice, 50f. I have always had good relationship with my stepmom, she always treated me nicely, and insisted I mustn\u2019t see her as a mom but as a friend. keep in mind she is much wealthier than my dad, and purchased his house and the beach house they currently own. For Christmas, me and my sister, Selena, 19f, decided to go to my stepmom\u2019s beach house with my dad and step sibling. also keep in mind that the beach has insects and spiders, as it is very tropical + I have a serious debilitating phobia of spiders which all of my family knows about. Everyday I used to find spiders in my room, which was really hard to deal with, since I would just try to pretend I didn\u2019t see them until I could find someone to get them out. Regardless, one day, my stepmother was helping me get the spider that was in my pillowcase, of course, I freaked out.  I suggested that I could get an Uber to my mom\u2019s place, which isn\u2019t far away, since I really wasn\u2019t enjoying the vacation because of that but could see them in the city for New Year\u2019s Eve. she got extremely upset at that, saying that I was nothing more than a spoiled little b word and that I was a cow and that I could just call my mom but nobody wants me in their house anyway. I started ugly crying, this wasn\u2019t the first time she called me stuff like that but we had a friendly relationship now. I called my mom and she threatened my dad, who defended my stepmom, and called him a bad father, and now is fighting for full custody of me and that really hurt my father. I know that this has caused a strain on my dad and stepmother\u2019s relationship, and that if they divorce my father is losing the house and a place to live, as he doesn\u2019t work and makes money anymore. My sister is blaming me, saying I could have stayed a few more days,  but my mother says no matter how I freaked out, Alice could never say these things to me. Was I the AH? How do I navigate this?",

My best friend, 17M, stands at 6'0-ish, and we normally ride the bus together after school, on days when my older brother can't pick us up. My bus is normally overcrowded, and people tend to bring their friends on my bus which causes it to be more overcrowded than normal. One of the girls who rides on my bus got on a bit late, and there wasn't any seats left on the bus. The guys in the back tried to tell her to sit on the floor, when the bus driver told her to sit with me and my friend. I have crippling anxiety and physical touch isn't something that works well with my brain, unless uou're my best friend. I've heard people suggest that this girl is Autistic, but me and my friend don't have room in our seat, especially when we have backpacks on too. ...The assistant principal gets on, and... Suggests that this girl sits in my lap? She's a stranger, and also 14. That's weird, and I'm not comfortable with that, and neither is my friend. We both say no, and end up getting kicked off the bus, and we both got detention. But... Did I really make the wrong decision telling the assistant principal that I don't want a random 14 year old sitting on my lap? Why couldn't they have asked somebody else to let her sit in their lap. I don't think anyone would've said yes, and does that mean they'd give our entire bus detention? I'm happy with the decision I made, but I've been made feel like I made the wrong choice, and now I'm unsure. Should I have let her sit? Was I the a**hole??",

        "selftext": "(29f) I'm having a Vegas wedding in August and my fianc\u00e9 (31m) and I decided to make it a weekend celebration with all kinds of activities leading up to the big day. One of the activities on the itinerary is to attend a brunch/pool party spot where you have to pay to rent cabanas and chairs. My best friend (30f) said that as a gift from her and her boyfriend, they would rent a cabana for the four of us. I put gift in quotes because in my mind, when you give something as a gift, you relinquish all control over that item and the person you gave the gift to has complete control over what they want to do with said gift. So since she said the cabana was a gift for me and my fianc\u00e9, we said that we don't mind sharing it with the rest of our guests. However, my best friend is really adamant about my other friends/guests not being able to join us in the cabana unless they pitch in some money. So I assumed, if she's trying to control what we do with the cabana, then it's really HER cabana and she's just sharing with us. So I told her that I appreciate the gesture, but I'd rather rent my own cabana and share with everyone because if I'm going to have a huge cabana anyway, I'm not gonna charge my friends to sit with me. I don't mind sharing with my friends. And I get that my friend group is not affiliated with her, she doesn't owe them anything and that's fine, which is why I told her that she can go ahead and get her own cabana and I'll just get my own that i can share. But she's arguing that her intent was not to buy her own cabana but to buy it for me and my fianc\u00e9 and she doesn't see the point in having two large cabanas. Now she seems to be pretty disappointed that I refused her gift. AITAH?",

She has stated this throughout the years. And I have asked her in the past multiple times to talk to me about what\u2019s upsetting her instead of replying to me in her basically upset code words.She refuses. It\u2019s always those words by themselves.

This has always upset me. A few months ago I started to just delete the one word text where she responds with those words so that I can just move on from them and not get upset by them. Because it genuinely upsets me when that\u2019s the only reply I receive and that when I try to talk to her or ask what\u2019s wrong I\u2019m only given those in response. She recently used my phone to look up a recipe she sent me in the past, and in doing so saw our text from my side, where I had removed the text with one word text.

Because of this, I'm already starting to prepare what I'm going to take with me when I move out, even though that likely won't be a while because I also plan to move in with 2 of my close friends and we need to arrange where we'll be living first. Some things I definitely want to take with me when I move out are my gaming consoles. An Xbox 360, an Xbox One S, and a Playstation 4, all of which were given to me as birthday or Christmas presents. Because they were given to me specifically, I think it's only fair that I get to take them with me when I move out. However my mother doesn't seem to think so. My mother believes that I can only take one console with me, the ps4, and leave both Xbox consoles with them. Her justification for it is that she and my sister (5) won't have anything if I take all the consoles. She also said that it's a thing that when you get a new console the older one is passed down as a family console. I thought this was completely stupid, because they were given to me as gifts, and now she just expects me to leave 2 of them behind just so they can actually have gaming consoles. I'd like to add that I've spent my own gift money on both the ps4 AND xbox one to buy games and other things for certain games, but she's also bought quite a bit of stuff on the xbox too (DLCs for the Sims 4 mainly). That's another reason why she doesn't want me to take the xbox one, because she spent money on it herself. I feel like she's trying to just guilt trip me, but I need to know if I'm really in the wrong for wanting to take things that were given to me with me when I move out. WIBTA? Edit to add: I feel like I should have pointed this out originally, but my mother is acting like there would be absolutely no at home gaming consoles left in the house when that isn't the case at all. We have an old gamecube that has quite a few games too, all it needs is to get new cords to plug in to the tv and then the power button needs to be fixed because it's stuck pressed down Edit 2: since a lot of people are bringing up visiting my family when I move out and leaving one console there for them and switching the consoles out, that wouldn't be an option, if I leave a console it's gone for good. My parents haven't been the best people my whole life for more serious issues I didn't feel the need to go into before, but these things are making me decide to go no contact with my father and limited contact with my mother.",

On Christmas Day we told them to meet us  at a nice restaurant for Christmas dinner. What I saw was pitiful. They were both skin and bones. I told them they could hook a big heater up to their car and stay in our driveway until the storm passed. It has well passed and they are still here and we\u2019re cooking every meal for them which has put us in a financial strain.                                              My BIL has been on drugs for a while and can\u2019t hold down a job because of it. Since my MIL has stayed with him she is also doing heavier drugs and her mental health is declining. She lost her husband two years ago and since then is loosing her mind. She will talk about people stealing her name on Facebook and framing her to drag her to hell. She\u2019s always saying stuff like this. My BIL leaves a mess in the driveway, the neighbors have mentioned it to me. He also revs up his car and the neighbors have complained. My MIL is waiting on a \u201cbig check\u201d and has been for a year but I fear that has already been spent on drugs.

I told him to give them money for a hotel for a week since he finally found a job at a restaurant and that they couldn\u2019t come back. My husband says I don\u2019t have a big heart like him because I\u2019ve never been homeless and he has. I feel like we need to push them out so that forces them to get their life together.

        "selftext": "Early on in our marriage I shared with my wife how my parents would buy treats and not share them with us kids. We were dirt poor to the point of going hungry, and sometimes they would buy things like ice cream or Fritos or something like that and it was hands-off for the kids.  So now here we are with four kids of our own. We are not poor, but we are not rich. We have an overstocked snack cupboard and the kids don't want for anything. They are free to get snacks as they want. We rarely deny them what they ask for. When we have a treat everyone gets it.  I really enjoy sitting down and drinking a cold sparkling water. Like a Bubly or a La Croix etc. It calms me down. My therapist even recommended it as a way to restart. The thing is the kids also love sparkling water so when we buy a 12 pack, it is gone in less than two days. Sure I've had a couple, but when I want one again, they are all gone. Sometimes we will go crazy and buy a couple Costco packs which just means that everyone drinks them at double the rate, and when I want one they are once again gone. Even if I expected there to be some.  I don't think it's a wise budget move for everyone in the family to constantly be drinking sparkling water, especially when we are trying to save money, but I want one when I want one. My wife and kids think this is selfish and my wife will remind me what I told her about my own family.  I want to be able to enjoy a sparkling water when I want, without the fear of them being gone. Sometimes I will hide a couple in the fridge and be extra upset when I discover they are gone. Shouldn't I at age 44 be allowed to have something of my own like sparkling water!? I've considered buying my own mini-fridge, but that seems ridiculous, and it's not cost or energy effective and how would that be different? I've asked my family to help me resolve this and they just think I'm being selfish and should just go without sparkling water when everyone else goes without, and have some when everyone else is having some.

        "selftext": "Title. My fiancee and I are in the planning phase of our wedding (yay) and I recently told my mom that a friend of mine (a very lovely Satanist metalhead) would be officiating the wedding as per The Satanic Temple wedding ritual. An argument ensued where she expressed to me that it was disrespectful. I told her that I had no intention of doing anything in poor taste, and that we wanted a fun wedding that was defiant and defied expectations. I asked her why she was offended, and if she was Christian, Catholic, etc. to which she replied no.  She texted me later that night and expressed that she didn't know *why* she told me she wasn't Catholic, and that she actually was. She then informed me that if we held the wedding like this, and included a satanic message, that she and my dad wouldn't attend. Since then there has been constant fighting with her and there has not been a resolution.  For context, I come from a very supportive non-religious family. My father is an atheist, and always has been. Until this issue with my mom, she had never been Catholic, never really gone to church, never raised us with a faith, never expressed theistic religion, or anything. It was however brought to my attention that when she and my dad got married, it was at a Catholic church (I was too young then to know this so it was news to me.) One of my mom's points is that doing a ceremony like this feels to her like an insult at her wedding ceremony directly, like we're doing it to defy her. I told her that it had nothing to do her and that it wasn't about her, to which she told me it was unfair to tell me things aren't about [her]. Added context, I am a trans woman marrying another woman. My parents love my fiancee dearly, and have been accepting and supportive of my identity for as long as I can remember. Now functionally, this is a normal wedding ceremony for all intended purposes. Truthfully, fiancee and I are just freaks who want a freak wedding. It's harmless, as is The Satanic Temple and its beliefs if you look them up. It's non-theistic, community service oriented religion in the loosest sense of the word. We just wanted to do something fun. The thing is, I have no intention of changing anything about our wedding to accommodate my mom. Fiancee's family is cool with it, all of my family members are cool with it- but my mom insists that she and my dad will not be attending if we hold the ceremony in this way.  Am I the asshole? Or is she being unreasonable? Edit for added context\u2022TST aligns with our values, and we aren't doing it for the image\u2022person doing the ceremony is my best friend and is fully supportive",

Growing up, she\u2019d blow her allowance on random things and never learned to budget or save. I tried to give her advice over the years, but she never listened. Fast forward to a few months ago, when Sarah came to me in tears saying she was drowning in debt. She had credit card bills, personal loans, and even payday loans just to get by. She said she was struggling to pay rent and was about to lose her apartment and car. At first, I wasn\u2019t shocked but was concerned. I told her I\u2019d help her come up with a plan to get out of debt, but I wasn\u2019t going to just give her money. She then begged me for a loan, claiming she\u2019d pay me back soon. I told her no. I didn\u2019t want to enable her bad financial habits. I offered to sit down with her and create a strategy to pay it off, but she didn\u2019t like that response. Now, she\u2019s asking again, saying the situation is even worse. She claims she\u2019s \u201clearning from her mistakes\u201d but still wants me to bail her out. Our parents think I\u2019m being too harsh and selfish for not just helping her out this one time. They\u2019ve always been the ones to step in and cover for her, and I\u2019m the one who\u2019s always tried to teach her responsibility. But I feel like if I give in now, she\u2019ll never learn. I\u2019m torn. I want to help, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s my responsibility to fix her financial mess when she hasn\u2019t made any real effort to change. AITA for refusing to give her money?",

        "selftext": "I (26F) moved into an apartment in Florida with my college bestie (21F). I let her pick her room, so she took the master with an en-suite, and I got the smaller one. I also furnished most of the place, including putting a 75\u201d TV in the living room. A few months in, I got pregnant and decided to go home to give birth, but I kept paying rent since I planned to return. Before leaving, I moved my TV into my locked bedroom. She could still use everything else, but I did this because she gets careless when high or drunk\u2014leaving keys in the door, passing out randomly, etc. I didn\u2019t want my things stolen or damaged. About a month later, she mentioned her brother was staying over. He was cool, so I had no issue with it. I was actually thinking of offering him my room since he was only staying a few days. But on FaceTime, I noticed a big TV in the background. I asked, \u201cOh, you got a new TV?\u201d She said no. \u201cDid he bring one?\u201d Again, no. Then she pans the camera and says, \u201cOh, we took yours out of your room. It just goes with the aesthetics.\u201d I said, \u201cBut my room was locked?\u201d She just shrugged. \u201cI used a knife to get in.\u201d Like it was nothing. I blacked out, cussed her out, and ended the call. Then I asked my maintenance friend from the complex to check things out. It wasn\u2019t just my TV\u2014my room was messy, my locked bathroom had been broken into, and both she and her brother had been wearing my clothes. I was livid. I called her, and she finally answered when I threatened legal action. She said it was selfish of me to put the TV in my room because they had nothing to use. Mind you, we both had TVs in our bedrooms. At that point, I was done. I had my sister and a friend clear out my stuff while she was at work. Anything we bought together, I sent her half the money for\u2014including the dining table, even though I was being petty when I took it. I also disconnected the electricity (didn\u2019t want her running up a spite bill) and stopped paying rent. Unfortunately, I lost the baby and returned earlier than planned. When I got back, the apartment was trashed. She had moved out, stopped paying rent, and now the delinquency is on both our credit reports. Years of friendship gone, just like that. No apology, no accountability, no nothing. Just one FaceTime call, and that was it. AITA for handling it this way? Should I have kept paying rent since moving in together was my idea?",

        "selftext": "Hello Reddit universe, first post. Let\u2019s get into it. I (38 M) have a girlfriend (Bonni) with a 13-year old son, and they live in a house with her sister. Her sister has a boyfriend, Dude, who comes around but doesn\u2019t live there. He normally carries a pistol on him. I haven\u2019t known him long, but he seems like a nice guy and we typically get along. He has seemed responsible with his guns which I appreciate, especially with kids around. I\u2019ve been around firearms my whole life and take gun safety seriously. The other night Bonni, her son and I get home to an empty house and as we are getting ready for dinner, she notices a small fanny pack on the kitchen table that doesn\u2019t belong to us. She moves it, notices it\u2019s heavy and asks me if I think there\u2019s gun in there. She handed it over and it was pretty obvious that\u2019s what it was. Knowing he likes to practice concealed carry, I wondered if it was loaded and ready to fire. So I unzipped the bag and took a look. I wanted to make sure Dude at least left it in relatively \u2018safe\u2019 condition. Thought about just moving it, but I really wanted to know the exact situation that was left unattended on the kitchen table.  What I found was a loaded Glock 9mm with a round in the chamber and ready to fire. It was holstered, but being a Glock, there is no traditional \u2018safety\u2019 on the gun and anyone could just pull it out and fire off a round. So I dropped out the magazine, cleared the round from the chamber, and put it back in his bag in a much safer condition than I found it.  I then text him telling him I did that, and let\u2019s make sure that doesn\u2019t happen again. He then calls me NOT to apologize, but to tell me how pissed off he is that I violated his privacy. A day later thought he\u2019d come to his senses but I hear that he is still livid and that I should apologize, although I have not heard a single bit of remorse or apology from him to Bonni for leaving an unsecured, loaded gun sitting out for anyone to get at.  In my mind, the safety of everyone in the house, especially the kid, is priority #1 and should far outweigh anyone\u2019s feelings of privacy violation. No, I wouldn\u2019t be stoked if someone in general decided to open and look in my bag. But if I were to make the huge mistake of leaving a loaded gun in a common area where a kid lives, if anything I\u2019d hope that someone responsible would do the same thing I did, make the situation safer, and help prevent any chance of my mistake becoming something much worse.  AITA for prioritizing this safety concern over Dude\u2019s privacy? UPDATE: To be fair I missed a detail - turns out he had given the gun to Bonni\u2019s sister to take with them to lock up, and she left it on the table on accident. ",

A few weeks ago, her niece, we will call her Megan, (24 f) unexpectedly and very suddenly experienced the passing of her baby that was only a month old.  My birthday is coming up soon, so I extended the invitation to Megan. I was hoping that having a night out with friends would give her an opportunity to have a distraction. I told her that it was completely up to her of course, but she was more than welcome to join us.  Given that many people in our friend group have had questions and curiosity surrounding the passing, I included a warning to the guests that discussion about the baby, and of course his passing was off limits. I approved the message with Rose before posting it.  It reads: Hey ladies... for my birthday on the 25th, we're having dinner at (local restauran), probably around 5 pm, then to (local bar) for a bit afterwards.  ..Just so you know, Megan will be there and I'd appreciate everyone respecting her privacy. Discussion about (the baby) is off limits. We're there to have fun & I truly want her to be able to do that by any means necessary, as much as it is possible.   Let me know in the next week or so if you'll be able to make it so I can give a head count for a reservation.  This message caused one friend to call me crying because she thought it was directed at her and she was offended that I would think she'd do such a thing, necessitating a warning post. I explained that Megan is understandably very fragile right now and I was just trying to assure that no one said anything to upset her. This friend understood after our chat and everything was fine.  About 24 hours later another friend, (who was honestly more the target of my post due to the fact that she was asking me questions at an event we had recently attended together, while Rose & Megan were not present),left the group chat and deleted me from social media.  So, am I the a-hole for feeling the need to post a warning to protect Megan? ",

On the 23rd my sister-in-law had messaged me and told me that they are throwing a small Christmas party and she told me that her sister-in-law and her in-laws and her parents are all going to be joining them and they would really like for us to come as well. Very specifically she named everybody who was going to be there.(this will be relevant later). Later that night I showed my husband the text messages and said it would be really nice if we join them for Christmas as his whole family doesn\u2019t get along and it would be nice for his mom to see at least some of the siblings interacting. On Christmas Day I woke up early to make some things to bring over to their house and wrapped up the gifts that I had prepared for everybody as we approached their house we saw a vehicle that belong to a person that me and my husband, both don\u2019t get along with and have had major problems with in the past. I told my husband that maybe it\u2019s just a car that looks like his because his sister knows that we would not come over if we knew that this person was going to be there. We decided to walk in and give the gifts and say hi to everyone and both agreed that if said person was invited that we would just come up to his sister and brother-in-law and let them know that we are actually going to be leaving. Well, unfortunately for us he was there and we didn\u2019t want to make a big scene so I came up to his sister in the kitchen and said I\u2019m really sorry that we\u2019re leaving and that if I knew that he was invited we would\u2019ve just told her right away that we weren\u2019t going to come and I felt very bad For making the situation uncomfortable. she looked really disappointed, but understood and decided to walk us to the door. at this point, everything was fine until her husband ran in and started yelling and cussing and calling us names. this was pretty out of character for him, but also very inappropriate nonetheless especially because in my opinion, we didn\u2019t do anything wrong by leaving Christmas when we are uncomfortable with being around someone we don\u2019t like and wanted to avoid any conflict and not make a scene. he kept screaming and calling us names and telling us that he can invite whoever he wants to his house which we both never told him that he couldn\u2019t. The screaming continued and his kids in-laws and his parents all came to see what was going on me and my husband quietly put our shoes on and he slammed the door in our face so I\u2019m curious does this make us the assholes for leaving Christmas when we were unaware that a person we do not get along with was invited as well especially when his sister went out of the way to text me a list of everybody who is gonna be there but somehow leaving this person out.

        "selftext": "Ok so I(23F) am engaged and have been planning my wedding for the past 6 months. The wedding is in another 6 months, the day we met/the day we got engaged, and I\u2019m going crazy with the planning. My fianc\u00e9 is such a mamas boy he\u2019s letting her take over the whole wedding!  So far she\u2019s chosen the flowers, the venue, and even the caterer\u2026 last week we had the cake tasting and I really liked the vanilla cake with strawberries but she kept on insisting for the chocolate cake saying \u201cit\u2019s more elegant\u2026\u201d I just lost it and went off on her about how she\u2019s taking over the whole wedding and that this is our day not hers. She got up and left so my fianc\u00e9 went after her leaving me alone to finish the tasting and go home by myself. Two days after I went to go see her to apologize for making a scene but also to explain how I felt. She was being dry and cold to me, which was expected, but she said she understands and she\u2019ll try to back off a little more now.  After I apologized, me and my fianc\u00e9 started fighting. I\u2019ve been telling him about this for months so yea it going to build up and that was my final straw. He started to make it about money saying that she is paying for most of the wedding so she is allowed to have a say. I told him its not about the money and that my parents have offered plenty of times to share the costs. I do ask her opinions on things just like I ask my mom but they are in between two things that I like not that she likes. We don\u2019t exactly have the same styles and this is my wedding day.  I\u2019m also starting to rethink the relationship because he always takes her side on everything and I really don\u2019t know if that\u2019ll ever change. I know that after his mom and I talked she went straight to him to talk about me. I don\u2019t know how I could live with a controlling mother in law that my husband will always back up over me. So AITA for going off on her and wanting to break up with my fianc\u00e9?",

        "selftext": "Please forgive me for bad english,not a native speaker. So back in our college days,we were a group of four, Me,Ethan,Vivian and Jayesh(names are changed). Jayesh was indian and he had come to our college to study(actually,me and jayesh were both foreigners who were here to study,I chose to settle down here).  Jayesh came from a very wealthy family,they have a very big jewellery business,from what I learned from jayesh,he was a native of the state rajasthan in india and people from that state are really famous for being involved in business and are ultra conservative(very religious,don't consume alcohol and meat etc).  Here is the where the story starts,we graduated about 4 years ago and were all busy in our lives but were still in touch with each other. As mentioned earlier,I too was a foreigner(from an eastern european country),but chose to settle in America,jayesh went back to India. One day jayesh had us all on a call and informed us that he is getting married in india and invited us to the wedding,he offered all of us first class tickets to and fro,the wedding took place in a five star hotel and the festivities lasted for a week,it was literally a free luxury vacation for us. Jayesh informed us beforehand that alcohol and meat based food won't be available in the wedding and we had no problem with that When we arrived in india and reached the venue,we were overwhelmed,there was different dresscode for each time of each day, tailors available to personally stich the clothes for the guests,sight seeing tours of the city and what not. Ethan seemed a bit miffed ,during the 4th day, when his discontent was getting way more visible,I asked him what the issue was,he said that this wedding feels so crappy without alcohol and food feels incomplete without meat,I told him that he was okay with it when the invitation was made and he can either suck it up and enjoy the wedding(it's not like the food was bad or anything,the food was great) or leave,which made him cranky for the entire trip. when we returned,he told me that it was rude of me to tell him to suck it up and he was forced to get through a dry wedding for a week,I told him that if he was miffed about alcohol and meat amidst all that grand festivities that basically made the wedding a free vacation,there is some serious issue with him and he is acting very ungrateful. AITA for saying that.",

        "selftext": "Husband (32m) and I (34f) both work full time day jobs M-F. He works a second job a couple Saturdays a month so we can (barely) afford to keep our 3m and 4f in preschool. When he has work on a Saturday, he expects me to stay home and be in charge of the monitor so he doesn\u2019t have to because he wakes up around 5:30 for work and works 12 hours. For context, kids are still on a monitor because the master is two levels below the kids\u2019 rooms.  I think that it\u2019s unreasonable. I rarely get to see my friends, and it\u2019s not like our kids wake up at night\u2014they\u2019ve been excellent sleepers since they were each 3 months old. The only time one of us has to go in at night is when a kid is sick or has a nightmare, both of which are rare.  Even so, I never get back after 10pm. And he goes to bed at 8 right after the kids, so it\u2019s not like he can\u2019t get a head start either. Additionally, we both get up before 6 for our day jobs and he goes to his hobby every Thursday, often staying out until 10 or later. And then gets up for work Friday with no issues. Last time I tried to go out a night before his second job because I wanted to go buy a dress for a friend\u2019s wedding that was two days later (because I had no other time to shop) and he FREAKED out at 8pm telling me I was ridiculous and needed to come home THAT MINUTE. Now I\u2019ve been up since 3:45am because I realized he works tomorrow (Saturday) and I accidentally scheduled a meetup with my friends at 7pm tonight, just before the kids go to sleep. He\u2019s going to be insufferable and insist I cancel which pisses me off to no end. We do sleep in separate rooms (have since my first pregnancy) so it\u2019s not like I\u2019m barging in after he\u2019s asleep. EDIT: Based on comments, here\u2019s some more info\u2026we sleep in different rooms because we have wildly different sleep habits. He works a second job instead of me because he makes 3x what I could in his side gig. We don\u2019t have any family who can help with watching kids. I try to avoid his work weekends, but when I made these with my friends, he didn\u2019t have his schedule for January yet. When I say \u201cout,\u201d I mean to friends\u2019 houses. He goes out every Thursday plus usually one other day a week. He DOES spend money because he skims some off the top of his side gig because he feels he deserves it. I don\u2019t get extra money because I don\u2019t work. He was the one who suggested I make an effort to go out more since I was resentful of being home with the kids virtually all the time\u2026but only when it\u2019s convenient for him (he complains every time anyway). When he is working 12 hours I am with the kids from the time they wake up until the time they go to sleep, so I would not consider that \u201coff.\u201d The one time I went dress shopping, the wedding was two days later and I hadn\u2019t been able to shop beforehand due to our jobs and husband\u2019s  social plans. EDIT 2: We both work full time M-F but only he has a second job. So, AITA? TLDR: Husband expects me to stay home when he has work early the next day so I can \u201cmind the monitor\u201d for our 3 and 4yos who don\u2019t wake up.",

        "selftext": "I used to work in the tourism industry and would get awesome travel discounts for myself and a companion. In 2019, I travelled with my aunt, and we had a great time. We\u2019re close\u2014we talk almost daily\u2014so travelling together felt natural. But in 2020, I changed jobs and lost those discounts, which led me to start planning big trips every five years to make them extra special. I just turned 39 and began organizing my 40th birthday trip, set for next year. Originally, I suggested places like Iceland or a cruise. My aunt vetoed them all, saying she wanted a ship with a casino (not my thing). Eventually, she seemed okay with a multi-city Europe trip\u2014London, Amsterdam, parts of Germany, Switzerland, and Paris. My sister liked those destinations but didn\u2019t want a motorcoach tour, so I decided on a train-based itinerary. I also invited other friends/family to join whichever legs they liked, since I\u2019m paying full price now. The conflict started when my mom mentioned that my aunt told her I must be \u201coff my meds\u201d for dreaming up such a plan. Here\u2019s where it stings: I have bipolar II, diagnosed 12 years ago. I take medication and follow personal rules against impulsive decisions\u2014I won\u2019t jump into something major without months of thought. This trip is more than a year away, so there\u2019s nothing rash about it. But my family sometimes attributes any emotional moment on my part to me being \u201cunstable,\u201d while my sister can have a bad day and get full sympathy. I\u2019m upset that my aunt gossiped about my mental health, especially since I\u2019ve asked her not to share my private details. She\u2019s done it before, but this time calling me \u201coff my meds\u201d felt disrespectful and hurtful. Now I\u2019m thinking of uninviting her from the trip altogether. On the one hand, it feels harsh because we\u2019ve travelled together and I wanted everyone to have the option to join. On the other hand, this is my birthday trip, I\u2019m covering my own costs, and I don\u2019t want to spend time with someone who dismisses my well-managed condition as \u201ccrazy.\u201d So, **WIBTA if I told my aunt she\u2019s no longer welcome on my 40th birthday trip** after she made those comments? Or should I just let it slide, knowing she\u2019ll gossip anyway? Edit: I had a number of comments suggesting the trip was free so I think I phrased it incorrectly in the original post. I would be paying for myself and everyone would be paying for their own portion of the trip. I'm considering their interests because they would also be paying to go on the trip. I don't like to travel solo as I've had a couple of bad experiences in the past related to my mental health while travelling so it's something of a safety in numbers situation. My aunt is retired and widowed so it's easy for her to join me on trips. Since my sister expressed interest I would be able to go with just my sister so I still wouldn't be solo. I get that it seems like I'm bending over backwards to accommodate everyone else but it's to my benefit in that I can travel with someone who is just as excited about travel as I am. I love travelling to experience new cultures and learn about art and history. This Europe train trip is just as exciting to me as Iceland or any other destination. I don't feel like I'm sacrificing for this itinerary but would be if I went on an ocean cruise. With regards to the gossiping, this is unfortunately something that my aunt and my mom's side of the family does often. They will gossip any chance they get. It's not something I enjoy but I was raised around it so am just used to it. If she only said it to my mom in concern that would be one thing but I know she's telling all of my extended family that I'm not close with and they're all imagining the worst-case scenarios. I also suspect that she will continue to use my planning this trip as source material for her gossiping. My mom shared what my aunt said in confidence which I appreciated because it could have continued happening behind my back without my knowledge. I haven't confronted my aunt because she would know that my mom told her and it would cause family drama. My plan if I do disinvite her would be to explain that I'm going to do something with my sister as a sibling trip or come up with a similar excuse that doesn't directly state the reason I'm not comfortable with her attending. The reason is if I say it's because of the comment, she'll know it was my mom and she may just double down on the gossip about me. I know this is ingenuine and I should be upfront but it feels easier to just let it pass instead of feeding the flame. I hope this extra info helps with your judgements. I'll continue responding to some comments when I feel it makes sense to. ",

        "selftext": "Hey going through a situation at the moment and seeking some perspective. I would like to prefix this with I am not seeking advice or criticism for how I wish to care for my mother or how they should have done better to save for retirement. I am not going to go into detail but please understand not every family is always capable of saving properly for retirement. Thank you for understanding. As for the situation I wish to seek judgment and prospective for. For the last four years I have been supplementing my mother's care she is 73 and has dementia. She is on Medicaid and does get some home care services what Medicaid does not cover I cover myself so currently she does have 24/7 care. This has worked out for around 4 years now, but I was recently offered a life altering opportunity and I am strongly considering on taking it. Our mother does live with me and my brother lives in the same state.  I spoke with my brother and asked since I know he cannot contribute financially could he contribute his time. I found a wonderful higher end memory care facility located near the apartment we lived in together my mom and I. Trying to keep her near what she remembers and stuff. I just asked if he would be willing to maybe have lunch with mom and check in on her. The memory care is located in Manhattan and my brother lives on Staten Island. My brother told me does not think he can visit often enough for it to be meaningful. I asked if our SIL could do it when the kids are in school. I offered to cover gas and ezpass.  He told me now and that I am an asshole for pushing the issue. I asked how am I being an asshole trying to keep mom comfortable. He asked why don't I take her with me. I told him how do expect our mom to handle a flight let alone move from NY to Europe? That is when he told me I took on this role of taking care of our mom so I have to figure it out. I mean I know my brother has beef with my me because I am part of the reason my parents could not save. We had to sell our house and move three times because of issues I caused in school. I tried to explain do it for our mom not me.  Any questions I will do my best to answer.  UPDATE: Thank you for all the replies and suggestions. I did try to answer as many questions as I could or felt comfortable with answering.  I wish clarify our family is fairly intertwined, we have dinner twice a month, every Holiday and Birthday is celebrated together my SIL and I do the planning and organizing. We go on vacations together, we took a road trip to FL just to go to Disney since flying is rough for our mom. We take weekends trips or outings often. My SIL takes our mom to do her nails and hair when I cannot.  This is why I was taken aback when he said no and did not give a reason, cause we already do so much. I also know my brother dislikes planning anything that is why I did the best I could to cover all the bases around our mother' care. I hired a care manger to handle appointments, renewals, coordinating care if I am not aviabile or if their is an emergency. They will be my boots on the ground. I did try to find placement on Staten Island but the options left much to be desired. I found one in the city and that is why I offered to cover the ezpass and gas. I was trying to make it as easy as possible but I forgot one thing. With the help of my SIL we did all the planning nothing would happen without us. Now if I leave that all falls on my SIL she also loses her extra support since if I was aviabile I would pick the kids up and stuff and we would hangout with mom if she had something else to take care of.  I acknowledge my brother's job is demanding and did not think of all the logistics properly. Still thinking about it but I properly will turn down said opportunity to keep the status quo. Me leaving does not just impact my mom it would impact everyone. I know my niece and nephew would miss mom greatly. I mean when we went to see Mufasa they were fighting to sit next to her because my mom needs to sit on the corner near aisle.  I still have a week to sign the contract, but yeah opportunities come and go but time with family is limited. ",

        "selftext": "I went to my brother\u2019s house yesterday to visit his 3 kids and pregnant wife. He was not home. The children are hellions, but I try to treat them as nice as I can which is hard. They don\u2019t get out much, only to go to school, so I told them to pick something to make and we will go to the store and get the ingredients. They chose candied grapes. Everytime I take them to the store, I have to preface our visit with rules as to what not to do in the store. No running, no asking for anything that\u2019s not on the list, no playing, no wandering off. As soon as we get in the store, I put the youngest(4) in the cart and the oldest (12) promised that she could push the cart with no issues so I let her. The middle child (11) immediately began asking for stuff and tried wandering off. The oldest kept crashing into stuff and knocking things over and the youngest was screaming at the top of his lungs. We checked out and the cashier gave the youngest a coloring sheet and some crayons. We walked to the car and I watched all of them get in the car.  When we got back to the house, I helped the youngest out of the car and realized that either him or the middle child had colored all over my car seats. I asked the youngest if he did it and he said no, and I told him I think he did and he kicked me. I took them inside and told my sister in law (who is sitting in the garage smoking a black & mild) what happened. She did nothing.  The next day, I was going to the car wash and discovered crayon marks all over the rear passenger side door that the kids were using to get in and out the day before. Yellow and blue crayon marks all over the door. The crayon marks had been pressed in so hard on the door that there were scratches underneath and I couldn\u2019t get the crayon or scratches off.  I took pics and sent them to my brother and his wife telling them that they need to pay for this and that his kids have no home training. I told him they don\u2019t watch them and just sit in the garage smoking and drinking all day while the kids run wild. I told them how I\u2019m always trying to do something nice for the children and they don\u2019t respect me or my stuff ever. My brother told me it was probably an accident and was very defensive. I took my car to get repaired which was $300 and told him to pay it. He said kids are kids and said that if it bothers me so much, I don\u2019t need to do anything for them. I told him he needs to take accountability and he said just don\u2019t do anything for them. Once he sent the money, I hung up on him. I wish I could show you all the outside of the door.  AITA for being upset with him and his wife for being bad parents and telling him his kids have no home training?  EDIT: when we all got out of the car at the house, the only crayon marking I saw was on the seats which I knew I could get out myself so I wasn\u2019t bothered too much. I don\u2019t know when any of the kids could have drawn on the outside of the door as I was watching them whenever they were outside the car. I think the middle child snuck out and did it after I told him I wouldn\u2019t buy him anymore candy for the grapes. ",

For backstory, I, (21F) have a best friend Ali (21F), and we've been best friends since ninth grade. We're complete open books with each other, and we've, until now, never judged. I always wanted her to feel safe to talk to me about anything, and I hoped she felt the same about me. We both go to the same uni and room together. So, around eight almost nine months ago (we had been friends since I started uni), I got together with my girlfriend Freddie (22F), and she's been my first love. It's been so incredible being with her, she is such an angel that just gets me on every single level. Biiiig oversharing time, but losing my virginity has always been something that really scared me, in the sense of trusting someone with my body like that. No trauma or anything, just scared, but I finally got there with Freddie a few nights ago. She was so loving and after we were done I just cried out happy tears. I was so just ecstatic that I got to do that with someone I love so much, and Freddie just hugged me tight and was so kind about it. I told Ali about this the day after and since them she keeps making jokes about me being a big big cry baby and will just mock cry at me randomly when we see each other. I just rolled my eyes at her and tried to just bear it, because no way was I letting her ruin that experience for me. Last night we were at a party together and she absolutely crossed the line. First, she was just making wah wah noises at me, but then she made a gross joke about Freddie having a 'thing' for crying. I just yelled at her to shut up because I'm so fucking sick of it. It's just not funny. She looked all shocked and I just called Freddie and asked her to pick me up. I've been at her apartment off-campus since, and Ali and some of our friends that witnessed it are getting upset with me and telling me to stop being so sensitive. I haven't answered any texts yet, and Freddie's telling me I did nothing wrong with removing myself from the situation, but I'm still so conflicted. \u2014\u2014\u2014UPDATE Um so the AITA mods wouldnt let me post the update as a stand alone so I\u2019m just gonna paste it here LMFAO.  I'm not sure if anyone cares for an update but I'm gonna post one anyways LOL! I got much good advice on my last post, but against what multiple people were saying, I decided to talk to Ali. We've been friends for long, and frankly, this is real life. I'm not gonna cut her off without even speaking to her first. Also, shoutout to the person who said crying after sex was a sapphic rite of passion, my girlfriend thinks you're hilarious!! Anyways, I messaged Ali and told her to meet me at the late night coffee shop we frequent, and she answered yes. I asked Freddie if she could wait outside in the car for me in case things go south, which she said of course to. I was nervous, and Ali was already there by the time we pulled up. She looked nervous too, but also somehow pissed off?? I sat down and she immediately asked me what the hell was wrong with me completely icing her out like that. I kept myself calm then, despite my rising anger. I told her how insane it was that she thinks she's the victim here, she taunted me for days over something she knew what really important to me, and then at the crest of it all she made a downright disgusting joke about my girlfriend. I told her if she didn't explain exactly why she thought any of that was remotely okay, there was zero chance of us ever being friends again. She shut her mouth fast, and looked kind of conflicted before she just blurted out some actual Wattpad shit I'd read when I was thirteen, I'm just pissed off because it should've been me making you cry like that. Uhhhh?? She pretty much just word vomited about how jealous she is of Freddie and that she's liked me since grade 12, when I got hot (UH?). Safe to say, I don't think I've ever been angrier. I can't remember well what I said, I was just\u00a0*so angry.*\u00a0I told her something about how bizarre she sounds, that I can't believe she would never tell me and just be a total bitch. I got too loud when telling her I was switching dorms, when an employee asked me to leave. Ali tried to follow me out but I told her to fuck off and drove away with a very concerned Freddie. I blocked her on our way home. I told our friends that witnessed the party, and also the ones who weren't there (just in case they were told something) the real story, and they all apologized to me. To be fair, they were all pretty wasted at the time of the incident, and probably didn't really realize exactly what was going on. They agreed to cut Ali out of the group, and that's just where we are now. I'm keeping the ones who berated me at arms length, just for my own sanity right now. Ali's tried to approach me a few times, but it's when I've been with people who know, so they helped me get rid of her quick. I'm still very hurt and weirded out, but I luckily have Freddie and good friends to keep me upright. Anyways, thank you so much for all the support on the last post, and have a good night!",

        "selftext": "My (35F) little sister (31F) gave birth to her second child late Dec '24. She asked me to be her 2nd birth partner to support her and her husband and I was stoked to agree. Mom thought it was great too. Some background on my parents (65F, 71M). Mom loves to play the victim. We used to be close, but I don't like playing her therapist anymore. My dad was a workaholic with zero emotional regulation and quick to anger.  Jump to Dec. It was the most amazing and emotional experience to help my sis and she has a calm, natural birth. They made baby's middle name my first name, total honour. I tried leaving to avoid overstaying but my sister wanted me to stay at the hospital overnight to help her while her husband went back home to their toddler, so I did. It was super special caring for her.  In the lead up my sis told my parents she's not sure if she wants them visiting the hospital or when they first get home. She also sets the don't come if you're sick and no kissing baby rule. They're miffed. Next morning Mom messages me and invites her and dad to have a coffee at the hospital. I say I'll come to our family home but she says no because they are in the middle of packing to move to their property 3 hrs away. When we meet, my dad is coughing/sick and he goes so we are going up to meet the baby now? I say no that's not the plan and you can't meet baby if you are sick. Dad starts yelling in the middle of the hospital cafe saying yes he can because baby already has an immunity from my sister and heaps of babies are born in disgusting conditions around the world. He then accuses me of subterfuge for being at the birth. He won't stop yelling and demanding to go up to the ward. I tell him he doesn't have my sister's permission and she needs to know he's unwell. My Mom is all I told you not to say anything. Dad keeps escalating. I tell dad I'd rather he be NC with me than I go against my sister's boundaries when she's so vulnerable after birth. He carries on about my conniving subterfuge and manipulation I think for not saying I was at the birth. I then told Dad that my sister asked me 6 months ago, sis had told mom multiple times since and sis told Mom yesterday I was on my way. Dad looked confused and mum says \u201cI must have forgot\u201d. I went back to the ward without them, warned my sister, said goodbye and made a hasty exit to drive back home, crying the whole way. My sis ended up letting my parents come into the ward though Dad wasn't allowed near the baby...I then find out they drove back to their property the next day. so it was zero about supporting my sister and her husband. I haven't spoken to my parents since. AITA? tldr: I was my sister's birth partner, my boomer parents lost their shit and accused me of deceit and subterfuge.",

        "selftext": "I (28M) am from the Philippines and have been in a bit of a financial bind recently, trying to manage our family\u2019s finances as best I can. My wife (28F) and I have two kids\u2014a 7-year-old son and a daughter who will be turning 1 soon. I\u2019m the only one working, and I earn about $850 a month. After paying bills and groceries, money is tight. In January, I received a total of $828. I paid $234 in bills in total and gave my wife $144 to budget for the first two weeks. The rest, I kept as savings for our daughter\u2019s birthday, with the plan to add more in the upcoming paychecks. Unfortunately, we didn\u2019t manage the $144 well, and by the next paycheck, we were down to $54 in savings. On January 10th, I noticed my wife only had $28 left, and by the 12th, she was down to just $5. When I asked how that happened, she got upset but said not to worry because it was all spent on us. At this point, I had to dip into the savings I set aside for our daughter\u2019s birthday to cover expenses. Fast forward to later in the month, and I decided to take control of the finances for the next paycheck. I told my wife I would be handling the money for the next two paychecks so I could keep track of everything. I told her she could still take money from my wallet, but she would have to let me know how much and what it was for. She got upset, saying I don\u2019t trust her and that I was being selfish. A few days later, I discovered she was planning to pawn her necklace to help her sister pay off her debt. I tried to open up a conversation by asking about her sister\u2019s situation, hoping she would tell me about the necklace. Eventually, I directly asked if she planned to pawn it to help her sister, and she admitted it. I told her I was against it because we were already in a tough spot financially, and we needed the necklace for our daughter\u2019s birthday. That led to an argument, and she said she\u2019d rather not celebrate our daughter\u2019s birthday than not help her sister. I tried to explain that it\u2019s okay to help others, but it can\u2019t come at the cost of our own financial stability. She became really angry and said she wasn\u2019t willing to understand or give me a chance to explain. She accused me of not trusting her and being selfish, and we\u2019ve been at odds since then. On top of all this, she\u2019s been acting childish in this situation. She insists on not touching our shared money, which we are supposed to spend as part of our budget, but then complains about having it difficult. When I called her out on this behavior, I made it very clear that she needs to grow up and be more responsible. I\u2019ve been feeling hurt because I feel like I made my plans clear and that I\u2019m just trying to keep us financially stable. AITA for being strict about managing our money and not allowing my wife to pawn the necklace to help her sister?",

        "selftext": "English is my(17m) second language so sorry in advance. It\u2019s a bit messy(both my English and what happened).  I had a crush on my friend \u2018Pam\u2019(17f) for some time now. Always figured that if I confessed, the worst that could happen is a rejection. I did not even get a chance to confess. My other friend decided to tell her on my behalf, something she did without consulting me, mind you. And it turns out Pam thought I was gay, because I watch Bridgerton and enjoy it enough to buy all the books. Said \u2018the only reason to watch the show is to check out the Duke and the Viscount.\u2019 As if my crush thinking I\u2019m gay isn\u2019t bad enough, she also told a few of our mutual friends that I\u2019m gay. Friends who frequently engage in gossip. I\u2019ve already had to deal with two false rumors about myself at school : that my dad took part in a deeply unpopular coup d\u2019etat and that I\u2019m Cambodian because of my dark skin. Took months to convince people my dad was already discharged before the coup, and some of my classmates still question my ethnicity. Unlike most people here in my country, I do not hate Cambodians, but I do not want to be mistaken for one either, just out of desire to avoid harassment.  She knew about those rumors and how they affected me. So I snapped at the prospect of a potential third rumor. Nothing against gay people; I just don\u2019t want to deal with anymore crap. Just want a peaceful final year of high school before heading off to university. I asked her \u2018Did it ever occur to you that I might have been checking out Daphne and Kate? Or did you forget to use your brain to think?\u2019 Pam said there was no need to be so rude and hostile, and that it was simply a mistake.",

        "selftext": "EDIT : I did tell my mom to stop. I wrote the title incorrectly by accidentally adding \u2018not\u2019 in there. Okay, so my sister (18F) recently introduced to us (my dad, mom, and me) her boyfriend (I think 18 too or 19) who surprised me because her boyfriend was someone that I knew at school (older than me) and kinda close with after being partnered with him for an event. Anyways, I noticed my mom seemed a bit disappointed when my sister introduced her partner, and I later asked her when they left to go somewhere. My mom then explained that she thought my sister would get together with her friend\u2019s son\u2014let\u2019s call him \u2018Jake,\u2019 obviously false but just for more clarity\u2014which I was just confused about, frankly, because that said son already had a girlfriend. Though my mom reasoned that it wasn\u2019t like they were married yet, and considering how my sister and Jake had always known each other from childhood and whatnot.  I got really annoyed at this because my mom also tried to pair me up with another friend\u2019s son, but he and I mutually agreed we had no interest in each other. Anyways, back to what happened, I told my mom that she really should just let my sister be since she\u2019s old enough to do what is right and knows what she deserves.  Mom seemed upset with my words and told me that she was only thinking of the best for my sister, but I told her that she should stop trying to interfere with my sister\u2019s choices and that what my sister did was her choice. She seemed dissatisfied with my words and stormed off, and I heard her complain to my dad that I was becoming unruly, but it seemed like my dad agreed with me because a few hours after that, he gave me a thumbs up.  And while I do have some bias with my sister because she\u2019s the best, I think that her boyfriend seemed pretty good, plus, from my experience with him, he was really respectful and never overstepped boundaries. So, am I in the wrong for what I said?",

        "selftext": "Throwaway account. My house is for sale. It\u2019s being sold due to my marriage unexpectedly breaking down after I found out my husband - \u201cAdam\u201d - had been having a year long affair and when caught, moved out. Adam has been a real POS in the aftermath - very justified, hostile and mean. It\u2019s been awful. Did I mention we have two kids? They are 3 and 1. I was pregnant the entire time he cheated.  I digress. The house is in my name and is operating under a private sale. And right now there are a few parties competing for it. I\u2019ll sell it in the next 72 hours to clear our debts.  Here\u2019s the kicker: his best friend (his best man) and his wife want to buy it. But they didn\u2019t tell me. They had the estate agent tell me. These are people who i have called friends for a long time, but when this affair broke out, they were sympathetic but then vanished in the last 6 months. Ghosted me and the children - would be cordial when I ran into them, and I would be too - but other than that, no support. Now they are in a tight race with others to buy it and I find the entire scenario weird and deeply awkward. Why wouldn\u2019t they just call and tell me beforehand?! Why get the agent to tell me? There\u2019s better ways to go about this. They aren\u2019t bad people. Just awkward.This is so shitty and emotional. But on a logical front, sell this damn house. So the offers are coming in and they\u2019re getting pretty tight money wise and similar in terms. I told the agent that someone needs to differentiate and make a bigger offer so that I\u2019m not splitting hairs. I am reluctant to sell to them as it\u2019s so weird and awkward. I feel like they\u2019re dancing on the grave a bit. I really want these other bidders I don\u2019t know to get it because I don\u2019t want to make a decision. I don\u2019t really see these friends anymore - my husband does - and I can see it for what it is, despite it being really disappointing by them.  Would I be the asshole if I went with these other people if the offers and terms were practically the same?  Edit: edited for paragraph breaks! Update (if interested) For those who commented or upvoted my post, thank you for your supportive comments and advice. I got a high offer, it's close to $3m, and it's from my ex's best friend and his wife. Fine. Obviously awkward and uncomfortable as hell, but fine, that's an incredible price and more money than I dreamed of this house fetching. It clears our mortgages and there's cash leftover. The other buyers walk. I tell the agent: yes - sold. Let me know when the signed contracts come through.But... I don't get a contract. The agent and I are on the phone all the time. He is communicating with me around the clock and it is reassuring. But I tell him I have a bad feeling, why don't I have a contract? He tells me that it's all in hand, they are finalising some smaller details, it will come through shortly.And that's when the calls and messages start. The husband - let's call him Paul - is trying to reach out. He wants to speak. I avoid his calls and tell him I'm busy with the kids, any q's regarding the sale direct through to agent, l'm ready to sign. Paul says, no concerns commercially, we want to check if you're ok, call me. My agent says - you're right to have a bad feeling, they won't sign until you say you are ok with this sale. He says in 20 years of real estate he's never heard of such a thing. I tell the agent this is emotional blackmall. He says he has tried everything to convince them but they insist on me saying it's ok. I feel shaky and sick. It's at this point that I very much can see that they are having a crisis of conscience. They have suddenly realised the optics aren't  great around this. They know that this will invite a lot of judgement... and when it comes they need to have some good 'spin' on it. I can picture them saying, how did she [me] feel about it? She was fine - she was just so relieved that another family was moving into it. Naturally we checked on her!. I find all of this so gross. So l'm over a barrel. I'm about to lose $3m if I don't tell them what they want to hear. It's too risky to call their bluff. I can't believe they let it get to this point and then throw this emotional condition into a commercial transaction. So I tell them what they want to hear only via text - so l don't have to speak to them. This forced message apologises that I have been avoiding their calls as l've been overwhelmed with selling the house and I'm cool with it. I feel... grubby. I don't lie, I really don't. But this is for my children. I send the text and within an hour my inbox gets the contract. I sign it. I receive a text from each of them thanking me and that my children and I are important to them and they would never have signed unless I was ok with it. Now I am waiting for the cooling off period to pass. Settlement isn't for 4 months. If they bail between now and then, and of course they could, they would forfeit their $500k deposit. ",

        "selftext": "Okay so I (29M) started college when I was 17. Because of my family\u2019s income and general status I was not granted much financial aid for college. Because I have 2 younger siblings, and my parents had other financial responsibilities, my parents could not afford to pay out-of-pocket for my undergrad and I was not granted nearly enough in personal loans. The school my parents and I agreed on is a private university, and tuition was high.  Because of the cost of the college, personal loans were taken out in my name, and my parents took out Parent Plus Loans in their name. Now I work full-time and my loans are on an income-driven repayment plan. I am easily able to manage my monthly payments on those (the ones in my name). However, my issue is that my parents are demanding monthly payments for the ParentPlus Loans taken out in their names. Their stance is that the loans were taken out for me and my education, so I am responsible for repaying them. The ParentPlus Loans cannot be transferred to me, and the payments are literally half of my income each month, because the lowest payment option is based on THEIR income, which is significantly higher than mine.  I have been paying them monthly for a year, and this has forced me to live paycheck to paycheck, unable to save for a car or house. I can\u2019t start a family, and I can\u2019t progress financially in any way due to immediately having to spend every dollar I earn on those payments plus rent/bills/insurance/groceries/therapy/etc\u2026 The ParentPlus Loans are currently in forbearance (since October) until April. This past week I told my parents I will not be resuming payments on them due to 1) Its not my loan. 2) We (Americans) are about to get hit with a recession/depression. 3) I cannot advance in any way making these payments. My mother has responded saying that\u2019s not an option because their retirement and/or credit will be ruined by this choice, and that I will owe them the money. AITA for wanting to stop these payments?  TLDR; My parents took out a loan for me to go to college, but the loan was in their name. They now expect me to pay them back for it, but I can\u2019t afford it. AITA for discontinuing payments so I can afford to live somewhat comfortably?  Edit 1 (More Info): There was no clear communication about repayment discussed when the loans were taken out. My mom took control of financial planning of my college, and I was very passive in the process, unaware any loans were taken out in their name until payments started being due. If they were my personal loans, they would be payed based on my current income. Edit 2 (More Info): My parents didn\u2019t force me to go to a specific school, but also I wasn\u2019t really provided choices. When I graduated high school, the discussion was basically \u201cSo you\u2019re going here, right? Because that\u2019s the best option.\u201d and there wasn\u2019t more debate or discussion on it. I liked the school. My parents liked the school. I didn\u2019t really take ownership of that decision or fight it because my mom took charge of college stuff for me.  Edit 3 (More Info): My parents knew what types of loans were being taken out. They both work in banking/finance, and know how money/loans work. And again, my mom took full accountability/ownership for the financial planning of my college.  Edit 4 (Wording): I have no stopped the payments yet. Adjusted wording to reflect that I want to stop making them. The loans are currently in forbearance. There was no sudden stop of payments to my parents. Edit 5 (Idek): People seem to think I\u2019m set on my opinion. I\u2019m here to listen, learn, and grow. I\u2019m not trying to screw over my parents, and I\u2019m not accusing my parents of being malicious. I\u2019m trying to come up with solutions that my parents and I can use as a team to combat this. And I want to hear all perspectives on the situation. Attacking me by saying I hate my parents or vice versa is simply not true, and not helpful. Edit 6: Because people are still attacking me for being \u201cselfish\u201d or \u201chating my parents\u201d I need to be VERY clear that I am here, again, to listen and learn. You are able to communicate your perspectives respectfully. I don\u2019t hate my parents, nor do they hate me. I\u2019m not set on any plan other than working as a team with my parents to combat this. No one is cutting anyone off unless this escalates wildly and unexpectedly. Yall need to chill on the personal attacks. I can be in the wrong about something without being villainized. If I\u2019m in the wrong, just point it out and explain why. No need to attack me beyond that. Final Edit: Leaning ESH on my own post. Thanks to everyone who has been kind and given me insight, advice, support, and reassurance. My mom and I are working towards coming up with a plan so neither me nor my parents will be screwed over by this. People who kindly and respectfully disagreed with me, you are appreciated. This issue is no longer Me vs My Parents. It\u2019s now Me & My Parents vs The Problem. Thanks all except those menaces who for some reason think I should hate my parents or vice versa. \u2665\ufe0f\ud83d\udd7a\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udd25 ",

Since my mum and dad work all day grandma has decided to do the chores while me and my sis are at school. This has been going on for years. Last couple of months I've noticed she's getting a bit tired so I finish chores after school so she can sleep a bit. That fatigue is often shown in various arguments with my mum. Grandma often takes advice from her sister (83F) who has 2 daughters let's call them Jenny (53f) and Megan (46f) which tells her to dump as and leave for the village to live with her and her daughters. My dad always says that grandma's sister and her daughters are the worst part of our family tree and honestly I agree they are spoiled and really bad people that have done some immoral things to other members of their family. During a family table my grandma moaned a bit about having to cook all alone when mum had her day off and was sleeping until noon. Then her sister said I told you to leave those ungrateful bastards they don't appreciate what you've done for them unilke my daughters who are an example of children raised right in this moment I couldn't hold my anger I stood up looked her dead in the eye and told her Are you really saying this? For your information we are all grateful of her presence not only because she does the chores but because she grew up my mum, me and my sibling with values and morals unlike you and your daughters. Have you wondered why Jenny got divorced twice or why Megan cant even find a job. You didn't do as good of a job as you think raising your daughters. You have no right to call us like that in our house in our table. Dad told me to go to my room so i left. I overheard my grandma's sister saying I wasn't raised right but my parents defended me. After she left dad said I was right and apologized for not interrupting earlier while mum said I shouldn't have done this. I do think i did the right thing defending my family and putting her in her place. What do yall think?",

He comes over every weekend so my mom and I can care for the baby on Sunday and Monday nights. They leave for work at 3:00 a.m. and leave the baby with me until my mom gets home at 8:00 a.m. Then my mom takes over until they get back from work at 2:00 p.m. My mom works 12-hour night shifts. I do this once or twice a week, depending on my mom's schedule. Mind you, I did not sign up for this. They pretty much said, She's not doing anything anyway, so she can take care of the baby while my mom gets home. I'm currently not working, hence why I'm home and living off savings. I also have had health issues since November. I will be having surgery soon. This is another issue. I clearly told my mom that I did not want people coming in and out of our house because if I get sick, my surgery will be canceled. She does not care, and my brother and his girlfriend were sick last week, coughing and sneezing all over the house. Now, this weekend, the baby has started to get sick. I just texted them that one of them will have to call off work to take care of the baby because what if she gets worse? I know for a fact that they are still going to leave her and my brother is going to get pissed and start with the name calling.  You're a selfish *****, she's your niece. That's the reason things happen to you because you're a ***** and hypochondriac. You're weak minded.When I wanted to go to the ER for my pelvic pain nobody wanted to take me. I had to call my bf. He had to get out of work and come get me. I feel like I'm always helping out my family one way or another, but when I need a favor, it's crickets. ",

        "selftext": " I (20F) have chronic neck pain and a diagnosed panic disorder. As part of my pain management and coping skills, I lay down in the bathtub and use the showerhead against my chest. This is relevant because it helps with both my pain and panic attacks. Additionally, I'm currently sick, and showering has been helping with that too. Tonight, I took a shower around 11 PM. Suddenly, I heard a knock on the bathroom door, and my roommate's (28F) boyfriend (29M) started yelling at me. He demanded to know what I was doing, called me horrible for taking a shower at 11 PM, and accused me of waking him up. This was especially upsetting because he knows about my pain and panic disorder. When I got out of the shower, he started the argument again. He brought up that we\u2019re supposed to be quiet after 10 PM (something discussed during a house meeting) as his justification. However, during that meeting, I specifically stated that I might need to take showers after 10 PM due to my health issues, and everyone\u2014including him\u2014agreed. He dismissed this, accusing me of lying, because it wasn\u2019t explicitly written in the house rules.  Throughout the argument, he kept interrupting me and became upset when I interrupted him once. Eventually, I lost patience and told him to shut up. At that point, he began mocking me, making fun of my dyslexia by calling me a retard and saying I probably can't read, which is why I\u2019m breaking the rules. He also accused me of lying again, claiming I wasn\u2019t taking a shower but actually taking a bath. He insisted he could hear me lying in the tub. I tried explaining how I shower, but he interrupted me again. (Why does this matter to him????) The argument became very heated. He accused me of bothering him with my problems and said that other people in the house need to sleep because some people need to go to school or work tomorrow. This was a clear jab at me since I\u2019m not currently working or in school due to my poor mental health following a traumatic event.  None of my actual roommates have ever complained about my late showers. In fact, they\u2019ve encouraged it because they understand how severe my pain and panic attacks can be.  So, AITA?

        "selftext": "**A little general background:** I'm a first-year law student. In my country, after high school, you typically attend law school for a five-year degree, take the bar exams, and then begin practising law. My college has given us an internship break until February, so I'm currently interning for two months. I (F17) have been interning with a firm since December. A new intern (F20-22) joined in January. For context, we've had minor arguments since her first day, when she made a comment about my financial background, implying I don't need to work because I must have daddy's money lying around, since my particular law school is quite expensive. Over the past few days, she has been taking off her shoes while working. Since we share the same table, the smell becomes unbearable. (She wears shoes without socks, and with the building's elevator out of order, we\u2019ve been climbing five flights of stairs daily in 31\u00b0C/87.8\u00b0F weather.) I\u2019ve been addressing this issue privately for a few days now\u2014starting with subtle hints and eventually directly asking her to keep her shoes on. Today, the same issue arose, but this time, I confronted her in front of other coworkers (who happened to be her juniors from the same college). The conversation unfolded as follows: **Me:** Hey [name], I hope this doesn\u2019t come across the wrong way, but I\u2019ve noticed you sometimes take off your shoes in the office. I understand wanting to be comfortable, but since this is a shared space, it might be better to keep them on to maintain a professional atmosphere. I hope you don\u2019t mind me bringing this up again. **Her:** Why does it matter to you? You already said the same thing the other day. **Me:** It\u2019s just a bit uncomfortable to see your feet while working (we have glass tables). **Her:** Then don\u2019t look. **Me:** You\u2019ve also been kicking me under the table, which is really uncomfortable. Could you please stop? **Her:** No, I\u2019m wearing heels, and they\u2019re uncomfortable to wear all day. I\u2019ll continue to take them off. **Me:** I get that heels can be uncomfortable, and I understand wanting to be at ease. Maybe you could try wearing sports shoes or office shoes like the rest of us? It must also be tough to climb the stairs in heels. But could you please keep your shoes on? The smell can get a bit overwhelming. **Her:** No. I would know if my feet smelled. **Another coworker (to me):** Show her some respect. She\u2019s three years older than you, *bitch.*   So Reddit, AITA for asking my coworker to wear her shoes because I don't want\u00a0to\u00a0see\u00a0her\u00a0feet?",

        "selftext": "This happened on the morning of December 31. Here's some backstory: I have an ex-friend who stopped being part of our friend group around 2020 or 2021 (I don\u2019t remember exactly). She blocked all of us because of her toxic boyfriend/baby daddy, who didn\u2019t like us. He claimed we were causing their fights by pointing out issues like her being seen with another guy and other cheating problems. A few months later, she unblocked us and added us back on Facebook. I accepted her request but didn\u2019t talk to her anymore. Eventually, I unfriended her because of all the negativity and toxic posts she kept sharing about her baby daddy. After almost four years of no contact, I was shocked when she messaged me at midnight on Christmas, asking if she could celebrate with us. I didn\u2019t respond because I didn\u2019t want to entertain her message and accept her message request. Then on December 31, after a week of long hours at work, I was surprised to see her son and his grandmother in our living room. In our culture, when your godchild comes to greet you during Christmas or days after Christmas you\u2019re expected to give them a gift or money. Her son is around 4 or 5 years old (I can\u2019t remember exactly). To say I was shocked and annoyed would be an understatement. I mean, seriously? My ex-friend, who I haven\u2019t spoken to in years, sent her son and mother to my house. I was upset and just nodded at the child. I heard my mom telling the grandmother, \u201cShe\u2019s not in the mood,\u201d and they left. Later, my family told me I was being cruel and cold, and that I shouldn\u2019t let my anger at the mother affect the child. They said I should\u2019ve just given money. I told them I wasn\u2019t obligated to do so. Now, I\u2019m wondering, was I wrong in this situation? Was I the asshole?",

We were close, and I'm the godmother to her kids (f9 & f8). For years, I babysat often, sometimes for days or weekends while I was homeless and struggling with mental health. This continued for years. About three years ago, I met my now-wife (f29) and got a job I love. Initially, my sister was happy for me, but soon began complaining I wasn't around as much. I explained that while I loved her and the kids, I had to focus on my happiness. I still saw the kids lots, just not as often. After my wife and I married, things worsened. My sister started accusing me of being abused by my wife because I couldn\u2019t do everything for her anymore. She kept insisting that her kids and her should always come before my wife. She would demand things from us late at night, like chocolate or coffee, even when we were busy. When we didn't drop everything, she\u2019d get upset. Things escalated when she started telling us her husband was abusing her, but then told us not to tell anyone. She also shared inappropriate family gossip, which was triggering for me given my own childhood trauma. Last July, I was hospitalized for a serious illness. During this time, my sister repeatedly accused my wife of being abusive and criticized us for not spending enough time with her kids, even though I was in the hospital. She even said my wife was selfish for not picking up my sister's kids while I was sick. In November, my sister told my wife she wasn't welcome at family events and tried to plan a vacation without her. I tried to talk to her about it, but she mocked my concerns, laughed and dismissed my feelings, saying I was just letting my wife abuse me.I finally lost it, mentioning how unfair it was for my wife to be treated this way, especially when she behaved the way she did, including supporting her supposed abuser. My sister then texted that she wanted nothing to do with me and I was no longer welcome around her kids. This is where I might be the AH, I phoned our eldest sister, distraught. I told her EVERYTHING. Which of course my sister denied.  Afterward, her husband messaged the family group, calling me and my wife vile and accusing us of making up lies about his wife. They then removed us. They also took our holiday money (nearly $1000) and have been bad-mouthing us ever since. So, AITAH for blowing up at her? ",

One of my friends had a bridal shower this weekend, and I could not be more excited for her. My ex-boyfriend and I have been good friends with this person and their fianc\u00e9 \u2014 we have even gone on vacations together. My friend is aware of my break-up and has seen first hand how much I have agonized over this decision. When I arrived at her bridal shower yesterday and started greeting other guests, I quickly realized that somehow everyone in the room already knew about my breakup. Throughout the night, I was approached by multiple people, even ones I barely know, who offered their condolences, told me they were proud of me, asked how my apartment search was going, and prompted me for details about my breakup and impending move. The MOH even pushed for details multiple times in front of the bride\u2019s family, even though I was very clearly trying to navigate away from the subject. The whole night felt like one of those scenes in high school when you walk into a room and notice people looking at you as if they've just been whispering about you. I played it off as best I could and tried to change the subject whenever possible. Apart from that, I would say the evening went fine and everyone had a lovely time celebrating the bride. However, since getting home yesterday, I can't help but feel really betrayed. It feels like my friend used my painful breakup as gossip and shared it with a lot of people who shouldn't know my personal business, especially since I'm not close with them in any way. Both my ex and I are real people with real feelings and our pain shouldn\u2019t be used as party gossip. I've also started receiving texts from people who attended the party, informing me that they've heard what happened and asking how I'm doing. While I understand their intentions are positive, this feels very invasive. These are her friends, not mine. I would have understood her sharing this with her partner or even a close mutual friend of ours, but this was much bigger than that. I texted her today and told her I could no longer be her bridesmaid or friend. Both her and the MOH think I overreacted. Now I\u2019m second guessing my decision and worried I was too rash \u2014 I just simply can\u2019t imagine treating a friend this way when they feel so vulnerable. Am I the asshole?",

        "selftext": "We like to do a few short trips during school holidays instead of a big vacation once a year. SIL and MIL tagged along once on such a trip (1 week, sunny destination, 2 hours flight). Sister-in-law is now pissed because we booked a new trip without her, according to her she also needs a vacation and we knew that. The problem is, going on vacation together was fun, but more difficult than when I go on vacation with just my wife and daughter (3f). They do not take into account the fact that a child is on vacation with us. We arrange everything in terms of accommodation/activities so that we as parents have a nice vacation, but it is also fun for our daughter. Some extra planning and a certain structure in advance makes for an easier vacation with a child. First SIL tried to manipulate or guilt trip our daughter (don't know the right word) to be allowed to go on vacation with us. \u201cWhy can\u2019t I go on holiday with you\u201d, \u201cAuntie would also like to fly again\u201d, \u201cAuntie thinks it\u2019s sad that she can\u2019t go with you\u201d are just a few comments that I heard her say to our daughter. I explicitly told her that she shouldn\u2019t do that to a child and that it is also very hurtful for us and her. SIL\u2019s next idea blew me away: She suggested to a 3-year-old to go on holiday with her and the grandmother (SIL and MIL) without us. Who tells or suggests something like that to a child? I hate being cornered like that, as parents we have to disappoint our child because SIL doesn\u2019t have the sense to keep her mouth shut.. Those people are also not suited to go on holiday alone with a child because they only think of themselves. Last time (daughter was 2) they were already nagging about the following things: Didn\u2019t want to go to lunch at 12.00 because they weren\u2019t hungry, didn\u2019t listen to the fact that daughter was hungry. Complaining because we didn't want to go to an evening market at 20.00 and we were already putting our daughter to bed. Didn't want to play in the pool because splashing water was too cold. Etc. They claim that we as parents would then also have a week of rest, but I think the opposite would be true. We would be exhausted from the stress for a week and wouldn't sleep. I don't like that idea, my wife doesn't like that idea, but my SIL and MIL are making us feel guilty to do it anyway. I don't know what to say anymore. AITA not to let our daughter go?",

She immediately called me upset, saying she can't believe I would plan this without her since we always talked about traveling together someday. Here's the thing - while we did casually mention traveling together, we never made concrete plans. I specifically saved up for a solo trip because I want to experience traveling alone at least once in my life. I also know Nina's financial situation (she's paying off student loans) and travel style (luxury hotels, structured tours) don't match with what I planned (hostels, flexible schedule, budget travel). Nina is now telling our friend group that I'm selfish and a terrible friend for 'abandoning' her and 'breaking our promise.' She says real friends would wait and go together or help pay for the other person. I don't feel like I did anything wrong - I used my own money and time off for a personal goal.

My friend is getting married next summer, she asked me to be a bridesmaid in her wedding months ago and of course I said yes. Months go by and my friend is planning this wedding, she tells me a week ago that they have decided to get married in Italy. I was happy and excited for her obviously. We talked about the dates, accommodations and everything we needed for this wedding. I discovered that I could not afford to travel for this wedding I told her that I didn't have the money to travel to Italy and she immediately began screaming at me, telling me You agreed to be a part of this wedding so figure it out I explained to her that when we talked about her wedding before she got engaged it was going to be a small wedding in our hometown, now it has turned into something bigger that I just can't afford. She then told me Work more hours or even move back in with your parents so you don't have to pay rent and make it to this wedding. You already agreed to be in this wedding, you can't back out. All my other bridesmaids are coming so why can't you? I felt horrible for it but I told her I had to drop out of being in her wedding as it was expensive to travel, find accommodations, pay for my dress. All of it added up was too much for my budget. She hung up on me and about 10 minutes later her fianc\u00e9 called me and asked me why I was being a horrible friend. Her parents messaged me, along with the rest of her bridal party telling me that I shouldn't have backed out of this wedding and just found a way to get the money necessary for this wedding. I've been feeling like a bit of an asshole about it. So, AITA for dropping out of my friends wedding because I couldn't afford it?",

        "selftext": "Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019ve tried to ask her many times about probate (which she refused to do with excuses there wouldn\u2019t be enough money to recover to make probate worth it) and she\u2019s also been asked multiple times about a specific inheritance my mother came into when my mother was actively dying.   When I discovered the circumstances and amount of the money left, it was obvious my sister (the executor, the POA and caretaker) hid this from us and that it would\u2019ve been a life changing amount of money for each of the beneficiaries on my mother\u2019s will, which states equal splits. We are going to confront her about this and give her the opportunity to fess up and make right to each sibling with the remaining amount and not even be penalized for what she\u2019s spent, so long as she\u2019s compliant and upfront. Honestly I just feel like an asshole wishing there was another way to handle it and fearing she will always resent me for outting this secret. AITA for not giving her a chance to fix it before sharing info with my siblings, even though shes already lied so many times about it and I didn\u2019t feel she\u2019d admit it in this approach? UPDATE: Thanks to everyone who responded. I appreciate the help getting in the right headspace about this. I finally have documented physical evidence now showing there is still quite a lot of $ left- just had to get on a plane and return to my mothers house to fortunately find a paper trail... Will update again. UPDATE: My siblings and I have developed how we want to approach this with her and the oldest is traveling into town as we speak so we are doing this in four hours. We have a lawyer on retainer. If she shows anything but full compliance, we will be forced to continue with legal action which includes removing her as executor and trying to validate the old will which divides the house four ways as well. I stayed up all night photographing documents proving her abuse of power of attorney, fraudulent actions and her self serving interests in hiding assets. She will be returning soon to my moms house (the house left to her in the possibly forged will but which is not in her name yet so she does not have possession of) which is when we will confront her\u2026  My sister has appeared kind and even \u201cgenerous\u201d at times to her friends and to her family. If there wasn\u2019t actual evidence proving these actions, no one that ever met her would believe she could be capable of this. UPDATE: After the initial shock of confrontation, my sister broke down in tears and spat out some swan song final lie about my mothers wishes being that she keep the money and keep it a secret. However she also said she never intended on allowing this money to not be split, but instead wanted to allow it to appreciate for a little longer to increase its total value before surprising us with our inheritance. Honestly, I know she\u2019s lying about that to save face/ maybe she believes that because it makes her feel better. It truly doesn\u2019t matter anymore why or what happened now that she is showing us account information and agreeing to the amounts she will begin transferring to each of us tomorrow after we ALL get to talk to her financial advisor. Legal action scared her and I\u2019m grateful these funds will be recovered. To the rest of it, let sleeping dogs lie. You may say I should still pursue legal recourse but since this money is all I wanted to recover, I don\u2019t care about anything else. I will absolutely keep updating on the progress. If anything goes wrong, legal recourse will be taken.P.S. of course she said she wishes I would\u2019ve come to her first as she obviously would\u2019ve cleared up the misunderstanding. As if.  UPDATE : My sister opened our conversation this morning with trying to get me on a flight home. She\u2019s completely changed her mind now and is pursing legal action. So are we. I\u2019m so angry right now. ",

        "selftext": "Last winter (2023) my BFF (38F) had a scary incident with her then BF of several months on the way to a  shared office party. I (36F) started receiving messages from my BFF that said she was afraid to be in the car with her BF as he was freaking out while driving, yelling at her, etc. My wife (31F) and myself of course panicked and turned around to go get her. Luckily my BFF was not harmed, but it was not very clear as to what was actually happening, to be honest, it was just scary. She told him he had to leave by the time she was back from the party, which he did. After, I understood from my BFF that they had broken up and he had gone into outpatient therapy.  Fast forward about a year, my wife planned a surprise vacation for the both of us. My wife asked my BFF if she would be willing to stay at our house for the week that we would be gone in order to watch our animals. Note: my wife asked her before she booked anything. Shortly after asking, my BFF responded Hi girl, sure I can help out, what a sweet idea! After some messaging they agreed on the dates, with no issues brought up. Fast forward 1.5 weeks before we were to leave, my BFF is over and she asked us if her mom and niece could come over and hang out while she was watching our house. We said no problem! She then casually dropped that she and her (ex) BF had met up recently and were kind of dating. Wife and I were surprised, which we also gently made clear to her. She brushed off our concerns and didn't really engage. A few days afterwards, my BFF sent me a voice message asking if I would be okay with it if her BF stayed over at our home with her for a couple of days. I was shocked and upset. I got back to my her saying that while her family was totally fine, we were not comfortable with him being in our home while we were away. She defended him by saying he's totally fine now and what happened during the incident is unusual and not the norm. I said that's fine, but we had not seen him since then, and it felt strange to have him in our home when we thought he had been out of the picture for almost a year due to his actions. She pushed back by telling my wife that she hadn't even wanted to stay at our house, it was annoying and out of the way for her. My BFF then suggested that all four of us meet up for dinner before we leave on the trip, so that we can reconnect with her BF. We said we were happy to meet up, but that we would also look for another solution. She pressured us into letting her know asap. My wife and I were very lucky that her parents were in town visiting for several weeks, and they were happy to stay over at our house during our trip. We communicated this to my BFF and waited for an invite to meet her up with her and her BF. That never came - in fact, there was radio silence. I have since reached out to her to try to talk things out, but Reddit, AITA?",

        "selftext": "My(21m) mom asked me to talk to my aunt about something. She said my aunt\u2019s being scammed. Not a romance scam, though; she is convinced she\u2019s talking to her favorite author who needs someone to pay her bills for her while she works on a new book. Mom said that since my aunt has no children of her own and I\u2019m the closest thing she has to a son, she might listen to me. I dropped by. Asked how she\u2019s doing and then told her my mom told me about what\u2019s been going on. My aunt muttered something about \u2018meddling older sisters\u2019 before telling me she appreciates my concern but there\u2019s nothing to worry about. I told her that her favorite author sold more than 20 million copies in the US alone and had her works translated into more than 40 languages; she doesn\u2019t need anyone paying her bills for her. But my aunt wouldn\u2019t listen. I did not immediately give up. I told her I care about her and don\u2019t want to see her scammed but she insisted it\u2019s not a scam. She just made a lot of posts on social media about the books and the \u2018author\u2019 DM\u2019d her to ask for money. I told her that\u2019s exactly how these celebrity catfishes operate and even showed her the Catfishes channel on YouTube. She refused to watch any of the videos. After half an hour, I said \u2018Okay. I\u2019m going home now. See you later.\u2019 When my mom asked why I came home so early, I told her I love my aunt but don\u2019t know how I can convince someone who doesn\u2019t want to be convinced. She said I shouldn\u2019t give up so easily on someone I love. Small update : After reading some of the comments, I called my aunt and repeated the point about the number of books the author sold. She said the author told her she made bad investments. I told my aunt that even if that were the case, authors get advance fees so they won\u2019t starve while writing their books. Considering her favorite author has appeared on the New York Times Bestseller list several times, she can probably expect a sizable advance. Then I told my aunt that if she doesn\u2019t believe me because she still sees me as a kid, we can go to the bank and talk to the people there. Or the cops. I also told her that I can contact the author. I\u2019ve looked up her official website and Facebook. So I can message her in order to ask for direct confirmation. My aunt told me not to do anything yet and that she\u2019ll \u2019think about it.\u2019 I will talk to her again later. Just giving her time to think it out for now.",

We\u2019re both working freelance, and her income is usually two or three times more than mine. We work equally in terms of time spent. When one person is working, the other takes care of the baby. As she earns more, she spends more. She treats herself and the family members (1 child and 2 cats) at her level of income. For example, we dine out a bit too much (I try to cook, not bad, but she usually doesn\u2019t feel like eating at home). She loves to buy expensive fruit over the affordable ones, or buy costly clothing, bags, or a top-of-the-line rice cooker. At the same time, she wants to feel equal in providing for the family. I try my best (I always sleep later and wake up earlier) to meet her expectations (and maybe haven't met them yet?), so I always run out of money every month. Every time I bring this into conversation, it\u2019s always \u201cI have the right to use my money.\u201d There's no way to get her to spend at the same rate as my income (which is above average in my city). -------- She used to work in the fashion industry, so she\u2019s a bit picky about what she wears. I never thought about sitting down with her to write down every item on her wishlist. Because what she can buy, she already buys; and what she can\u2019t buy, I can\u2019t help her with. At least, that\u2019s what I think. So, today, she bought a Chanel lipstick (first time after 3 years) and I (intended to say let me pay) asked for the price, and she replied $50. I said, \u201cWow, a $50 lipstick? Normal people can never use this.\u201d I can\u2019t afford it at the moment, so I didn\u2019t suggest paying for her either. She felt disappointed because of what I said, and because I never buy her any significant things except on birthdays (her last birthday\u2019s gift was a small necklace worth 1/5 of my monthly income) and some special occasions in the 4 years we've been living together. Apart from occasional flowers, I rarely buy her any significant gifts in daily life because I never save enough for this. I mean, it\u2019s not my priority to buy her excessive stuff that she doesn\u2019t really need. So, AITA for not putting my wife's girly stuff more on top of my priority? ----  **EDIT:** As everybody mention about the 50$ lipstick, I must say it's not a big deal for something you will use in 3 years. I just not prepare for that (I thought around 20$ to 30$), so it shock me and I say it out so unthoughtfully. Yep, so her point is not about this lipstick but the fact that I rarely buy her nice stuffs apart from special events. As I can see, my reason as not saving enough for this kind of stuffs is weak and kind of the excuses. On the other hand, we should have more conversation on how the expense is splitted. **EDIT2:** I read all of your comments and feel very thankful. Since this is the first time I tell my story in Reddit and I don't know what to expect. I just try to put on a short version of the situation for not wasting your time. Apparently, it lacks of some information and clarification. I want to answers some FAQ below and give my conclusion. **1. Is she usually have gifts for me? What are those?**  She gifted me many shirts (5 to 7) and pants (~3) in the first year we met, not so after that. She gift me 3 birthday presents - a coat, a helmet, and a phone (a decent 2nd-hand phone I choose to replace my broken one). I don't really remember anything else recently. Now looking back, I can tell how she's obsessed with fashion and want to put nice clothes on me. I feel thankful, for sure, but you see, those things are practically good, but too boring.  My birthdays gift for her is an Instax Camera, a wooden music box with horses cart riding the marrying couple (which turn out to be our's daughter favorite toy...), and a necklace (her choice). I tried to be creative. **2. Do I know that what she want is only a tangible gift to show her my love?** Yes, I know. She told this directly to me. In my defend, I want to shout out that my financial strain caused by following her lifestyle so I could hardly budget anything even for myself (I'm not doing that, I'm writing here to ask for your help instead). I bought her flowers once every two months. I bought snacks and small gifts (funny key chains, etc) occasionally. But those things is too easy to buy so maybe she dismissed it. **3. Do we have joint account? Do we really pay 50/50?** We used to have a joint account (and we put 50/50 into it), somehow it's complicated to handle it so we dismiss it after 2 or 3 months of marriage and spend on our own. Yes, we target for 50/50 on essential things. The renting, the kids (daughter and cats) expense, the market's foods and dine out meal, health care, daily stuffs,.... It's vary depend on every months. But I could say she paying more in general. It could be something between 55/45 to 60/40.  Even I pay less, my money is running out frequently. (For example, she pay 1000$ and I pay 800$). She still have a big deal of money to spend on clothes and sandals and accessories for her and our daughter (more than what their need), expensive fruits and snacks, milk tea,... After that, she still remains some for saving. **4. Does she a materialistic person?** No, I don't think so. I think it's because our love language is un-align.  For example, I touch her and say I love her a lot, but she doesn't enjoy doing that. She usually said it's not the words matter, the actions (gifts?) matter. I spend time with her, listen to her more than enough, and she think that's just obvious couple's obligations. Maybe I should know better about her love language. **5. My conclusion** As many of you pointed out, the question is why I'm still staying here, in the financial strain situation.  I must have a real talk with her (or us with counselor) to set up an equitable expense, not equally expense. Following that, we should have a joint account. I should also budget for some gifts, which is her go-to love language. Thank you very much for supporting me. I can't see how I get through this without your words. I hope I can give you a best UPDATE as I can.",

        "selftext": "Greetings good folks of Reddit, The title pretty much sums up the situation. My father owns a rental property, which we live in, and the remaining 2 units are rented out. Tenant #2, who we will call Mary, drops off her rental check in our mail box. If she is on vacation, or otherwise going away for an extended period of time, she\u2019ll give her rent before she leaves. Sometimes, her brother will bring the rent by to us on her behalf when she is away. It always gets dropped off in our mailbox. Tenant #1, who we will call Juan, does not like to use our mailbox to drop off his rent check. He insists on dropping off his rent in person to whoever is home. If no one is home, or we don\u2019t get back until really late, then he will try again the next day. We\u2019ve told him the mailbox is fine, but he insists on in-person delivery, as he is afraid of check theft/check washing. This would be fine\u2026 except he doesn\u2019t wait for us to open the door. He knocks, rings the doorbell, and when I get to the top of the stairs and look down, he already has the door open and is waiting by the bottom of the stairs. We live on the top floor. The door to our house opens up to a staircase, which leads up to the kitchen to one side and the hallway to the family room on the other side. Unless we lock the door, which we don\u2019t necessarily do during the daytime when we are home, he just opens the door and lets himself in (never going further than the landing at the bottom of the stairs). Today, he came by to drop off the rent. As expected, he rang the doorbell and was waiting at the bottom of the stairs, having let himself in. I asked him -painfully polite as I am terrified of confrontation- \u201cHi Juan! Next time, can you please wait for one of us to open the door?\u201d He looked like I cursed his ancestors, spat in his face, and shit on his carpet. He said \u201cYou don\u2019t want me to open the door?\u201d I said we would prefer if he waited for one of us to open the door for him. He said he opens the door because he doesn\u2019t know if our doorbell works. I assured him, with a smile on my face, that it does work, and that we hear it loud and clear whenever he rings it. He said okay and left, visibly upset. Guys, I cannot emphasize enough how much I hate confrontation, and what a people pleaser I am. I was smiling the entire time, asked him how he and his family were doing, and was pleasant the entire time. He looked at me like I spoke some unimaginable horror. Am I crazy Reddit? Is it wrong of me to have asked Juan to wait by the door to our home until one of us opens it? I feel like not wanting someone to let themselves into your home isn\u2019t a big ask, but he looked so offended, that I am going crazy questioning myself over it. I leave it to you guys to pass judgment. Edit to add a few things: Bumping up edit 4: Additional edit to clarify that **the front door is locked 24/7**. It is the back door that is left unlocked for a small window in the middle of the day, and only when someone is home. 1. The door is locked the majority of the time. There is a *small* window of a few hours in the middle of the day, only when someone is home, that my parents (the actual homeowners) will leave the door unlocked to allow family to come in. 2. I am not the homeowner. I would keep the door locked 24/7 if I was. 3. To the person who said they\u2019d like to see my reaction if something actually important happened in my life, when I said I am \u201cgoing crazy\u201d it was just hyperbole. I am more so confused at the tenant\u2019s strong reaction. 4. Additional edit to clarify that **the front door is locked 24/7**. It is the back door that is left unlocked for a small window in the middle of the day, and only when someone is home. 5. Additional edit to add that my parents don\u2019t care how the tenants pay, whether it is a paper check or an e-transfer. The tenants are older, and prefer to deal with paper checks. 6. I said what I did to Juan **at the request of my parents**.",

He plays multiple sports and both him and his mom say they're too important for him to miss out on while he's still a kid. It's caused a huge rift in my relationship. I've stood up for my beliefs, and have been told by her and everyone in her family that I am in the wrong. I am the bad guy for telling him to get a job. There's a lot of backstory that I'm not going to put on here. I've tried explaining thats it's not because I hate him that I want this. I'm trying to convey the gravity of this path he's headed down, and doing what I would expect anyone who wants him to have a successful life would do. My gf's ex is a piece of work, alcoholic with multiple warrants out for his arrest, and all I'm trying to do is prevent him from headed down the same path. Am I the asshole?",

        "selftext": "Details changed for anonymity. My wife's younger sister is lazy, knows everything and perpetually unemployed. Her main source of income is her mother. I have automotive experience (body work, mechanical, electrical, etc) which I'm always willing to use for friends and family.  Several years ago, her car died. I told her I would come the next day to help her purchase something dependable and in her budget.  She was happy with the offer and I started searching the internet for cars. The next day I call and she gleefully tells me she has already bought something from a small used  car lot. And (I wish I was making this up) paid the dealer more than they were asking because it was such a good deal. How did she know it was so under priced? The salesman told her of course!  And they're always so honest. The car: right front bumper and fender are dented and the light is cracked. She tells me that parking  brake failed and it rolled into another car. I noticed the car lot fixed the parking brake prior to her purchasing it. She said it's fine, they already fixed the parking brake wire again so it's all good. The car was burning and leaking oil so I told her to return if but they refused because now it was damaged. Her insurance covered the other person's car, but not hers. I did a quick, but safe, fix on it. This was a recurring situation. I fixed that car (at my own expense) numerous times. Finally it died and I offered to help her buy a different car. She was very receptive and told me to start looking at options.  The next morning she decided that she knew best and bought another lemon but never told me. She spent more on repairs than she paid for the car.  That car died a month ago and the person who loaned her a car wanted it back ASAP. Yet again I offered to help her find a dependable car. She seemed on board with it, sending me links to cars. Then she shows up at our house with another dumpster on wheels. Literally one of the cars I said to avoid at all costs. She never said a thing about buying it and obviously wasted my time again. I didn't hold back. I told her the car was garbage. It has an engine noise and unburned fuel smell in the exhaust.  Then she had the nerve to ask me to fix it. I just said No, not happening. I told her that I was texting and calling trying to help her find a good car 3x and she let me keep looking after buying a car. I told her since she's obviously so good at finding amazing used cars she should be able to find a mechanic to fix it since it's on it's death bed.  She acted offended and mentioned that she really needs the help and I always helped previously. I said too bad, should have bought a good car.  Now my wife is pressuring me to help her sister because she just doesn't know any better. I said this is how she learns. We're not arguing about it,  but it's definitely causing tension here.  Should I cave in and fix this pile of trash or let her find out actions have consequences? ",

        "selftext": "To give a bit of context before I start with explaining what happened. My family consists of me (M20), my sister (F24), and my mom and dad. We moved countries when I was 10-years old due to a few legal issues my dad got in, and have lived in the country we are now in ever since. To cut a long story short, my mom became emotionally abusive to me and my sister, which left me with a lot of issues and a warped perspective on dating, marriage, and having children. That brings us to what happened yesterday. It was my grandma's birthday, and they had come to visit us for it (grandma and grandpa). Things had been going fine so far, until the topic of what I wanted to do after University came up. I shared my plans of wanting to move to another country and then maybe settling down there or keep moving. That made my grandma ask me about kids, and why I had never dated before.  I explained to her my reasons, and she seemed to understand it (or so I thought). Later on, when everyone had a bit to drink, the topic came up again but with them first focusing on my sister, before it shifted back to me. My grandma asked me, again, whether I was sure I didn't want kids, and I confirmed to her that I didn't. She then went on this sort of rant of how as a man I had to have kids, and I couldn't just play video games all my life (I study game development and have made a few games already which did quite well on Steam). I was getting slowly uncomfortable and tried to change topics, but she didn't stop. It eventually got to a point where she called me dramatic, and said I was overreacting and to man up, and how, yes, my mom and dad did have issues, but they still did a good job raising us and deserved grandkids. At this point I kind of lost it and I told her that me even talking to my parents right now and not planning on cutting them off after I left was already me giving them more then they deserved, and that if she wanted grandkids she should've raised her daughter (my mom) better (from what my mom had told me, my grandma and grandpa had also been pretty shitty parents).  I then left to go upstairs and only heard them arguing downstairs. It eventually died down and my grandma and grandpa went back to their hotel, and later on my sister called me to inform me that my grandma had started crying after I had left, and my parents were partially blaming me for it now and wanted me to apologize, but they had called her cause they knew she and I had a really close bond. My sister agreed that I was in the right after my grandma had been so insanely pushy about this topic, when I had made it clear it made me uncomfortable, but I am not sure whether what I said and did was the correct thing to do. So, I wanted to come on here and ask people with no bias whether you all think I overreacted and shouldn't have made my grandma cry, or whether I was in the right to set my boundaries straight.",

        "selftext": "My parents got divorced and my mom moved out. I was still living at the house with my dad and I was covering the utilities which I agreed to help. I had been with my girlfriend(now fianc\u00e9e at the time of their divorce). Well I pretty much moved in with her and was staying at her house during the week and going home on the weekends. It eventually changed to never really going back home unless I needed to speak to my dad about something. He\u2019s been a heavy drinker for most of my life which he still is at this point. Me and my fianc\u00e9e have a baby on the way and we\u2019ve been looking for a place to live and we found one. The only bad thing about the whole situation is that my dad is looking as well and he\u2019s been bugging me about co-signing on a loan with him to get a house but he keeps telling me that he\u2019s going to pay it off with the money from house when it sells. But he\u2019s been saying that we could all move in together and I just don\u2019t think it would be a good idea with the baby and I also don\u2019t feel comfortable doing it and I explained to him because of mine and fianc\u00e9es situation. But anyways, yesterday me and her went to my dads house(that\u2019s currently being sold) to pack some stuff up and he was leaving to go take a walk and he said to me that \u201cI killed him for not co-signing with him\u201d. I\u2019m feeling really guilty about it and it\u2019s been tugging at my heart. I just want to know\u2026 Am I the asshole and in the wrong for not helping him? Or should I have helped and jeopardized me and my fianc\u00e9e\u2019s future?  -EDIT-Okay so I apologize to everyone that has replied about not providing enough information I was typing this out on my phone and didn\u2019t want a massive paragraph for everyone to read. So I\u2019m going to answer some of the questions that I was seeing in the comments. Me(M26) and my fianc\u00e9e (F27) have been together since 2018 and have a baby on the way that will be born in May. We are going through the buying process of a home currently. My father and mother are getting half of the money that the house is being sold for after the remaining balance of the house is paid but the only reason he wants me to co-sign on the loan is because his credit isn\u2019t the best. He got a DUI a couple years ago so he doesn\u2019t car so he basically relies on me to take him places which I don\u2019t mind taking if I have time and it\u2019s places like the grocery store, appointments, etc. but I feel like he\u2019s been getting pretty comfortable with it cause he doesn\u2019t ask me anymore just basically demands that I do it now.

        "selftext": "(Throwaway account BTW.) My husband\u2019s (34m) sister, Kendall (17f), has been living with us for almost 6 years now. This came to be because of major issues within my husband\u2019s family and living conditions that were unsuitable for her to be in. AKA, my husband\u2019s mom is a major hoarder w/ OCD. Beside that, my husband and I are both extremely proud of Kendall and how far she has come. She will be 18 soon (the sending-her-off-to-college blues are hitting hard!) and is halfway done with her senior year. To celebrate, her school throws a formal every year in January. The school also has an actual prom at the end of the last semester, but most kids treat the formal like they traditionally would for prom. Why? I have no idea. That\u2019s just how it is, lol.  Kendall has gone to this dance for the last two years. Both times I was the one who took her shopping for it. Both times I also asked her mother if she wanted to be present and she made up some fake excuse or didn\u2019t answer. I texted my MIL and asked if she wanted to come this time around but I told Kendall to not count on anything because of what happened the last two times. Kendall also texted. As expected, she never responded. Kendall was disappointed but she accepted it and moved on. I sat there for 3 hours while she tried on dresses. I think she looked beautiful in all of them, but the one she picked out was really a show stopper. We bought the dress, showed my husband, and some tears were shed. A mom of one of the girls in Kendall\u2019s friend group hired a photographer and so they took pictures there before going to the actual event. I took a few of my own before I sent her on her way. I posted the pictures of her I took on my Facebook (don\u2019t judge, I\u2019m old and will never switch to Instagram \ud83e\udd23) the morning after. She was getting tons of love from family members/moms of her friends.  After\u2014at most an hour\u2014of the post being up, my MIL called me and started berating me for apparently \u201ccausing her to miss one of the last important events of her childhood\u201d. I told her that I texted AND so did her daughter! She gave some excuse along the lines of being busy and how how I should\u2019ve told her in person. She didn\u2019t care the other two times we went dress shopping but now she does? My husband is behind me and thinks his mom is being entitled, but his extended family thinks the opposite. The same people who were commenting on my post have completely switched up and have been sending me nasty messages about how I\u2019m essentially trying to exclude my MIL from Kendall\u2019s life. That is not true. I don\u2019t know how badly she twisted the story, but some of those people have been riding my MIL\u2019s ass for years. My mom thinks I should\u2019ve made more of an effort and is guilting me with the \u201ccoming from a mother\u201d standpoint. Am I wrong for not trying harder? My husband\u2019s family is starting to make me feel shitty about myself but I also know that my MIL not being there was probably better for Kendall\u2019s confidence in the long run.",

        "selftext": "My bf (26M) and I (26F) recently had a baby. From the beginning, his mom has constantly created a my family vs his family situation. His parents are divorced as are mine. If it isn\u2019t his family vs mine, she\u2019s making comments about my body.  Some brief examples are her demanding she be at appointments and ultrasounds bc \u201cmy mom gets to\u201d. My mom never went to a single one or even asked to. Another example is when I did an at home blood test to know the gender. I had the gender sent to my mom because she was going to make a cake for us. The day we went over there to find out his mom called crying because it wasn\u2019t fair that my mom already knew. We said we\u2019d send her a video of us cutting the cake as soon as we did. She threw a fit and made my mom send her the gender before we cut it so that she knew too.  Then there was my baby shower where she got mad and uninvited me from dinner because I created a Facebook event for the baby shower before the physical invites went out. We have family out of town and I didn\u2019t know the invites would take a week to mail out. She doesn\u2019t have Facebook and claimed that she shouldn\u2019t have to find out from Facebook and that\u2019s how she\u2019s going to find out the baby is born etc. when we tried to explain that the physical copies were one their way she said that I should have thought more about it before I posted it \u201call over Facebook\u201d \u2026 it was a private event.  She also got mad that she wasn\u2019t allowed in the room while I gave birth.. and then made a comment that I wouldn\u2019t be able to feed my baby either breast milk because I\u2019m \u201ctoo small\u201d? My final straw was when she was holding my 2 month old baby and the baby started crying. She said \u201cwell it\u2019s because she doesn\u2019t know me and she\u2019ll never know your family like she knows hers\u201d.  Because of that final comment I now try not to see her at all costs. I feel she is always rude to me and makes my life miserable. I know this strains my bf and hers relationship but I just think these things are really rude and unforgivable. Am I the asshole for keeping my baby from her? ",

        "selftext": "Hey everyone,  So kind of an interesting situation. My biological father hasn\u2019t been in my life for probably around 25 years. He was in a very physical relationship with my mother and his ex wife while they had relationships. He was arrested and deported back to Mexico when I was about 11. Haven\u2019t heard from him at all since.  Fast forward to 2022 I get a random email from a young lady claiming to be my 18 year old sister. She and I talked after confirming some information about each other and her siblings who I knew of since I had met them when they were toddlers. She sent my information to my dad and he\u2019s been messaging me periodically from time to time.  Just a few months ago he asked for $100. I felt ok sending that to him because I felt this was a step to possibly rebuild our relationship. He ghosted me for 6 months after I sent messages asking how he was, if he was ok and all that. He messaged me again today asking for more money. No response from the other messages when I sent him pictures of his granddaughters. He\u2019s been continuously asking even after I said no.  I explained this all to my brothers and they said I should just give him the money and that I\u2019m being a AH for just helping him out. I feel like it\u2019s enabling him to keep asking. I\u2019m torn I want to help because he\u2019s my dad, but on the other hand I don\u2019t want to seem like a piggy bank for him. ",

        "selftext": "I don\u2019t really know what to do but I\u2019m really anxious and upset about this. a few months ago, my kitten poked some holes in my roommates gaming chair. it\u2019s a 300 dollar chair. she told me about it and i took some pictures of the damage. the holes aren\u2019t deep but there are little bits of leather peeling. i told her i could get something to fix it, but eventually i told her that i would pay for it to get fixed bc i didn\u2019t trust my skills.  today she sent me a long paragraph about how my kitten has been chewing her decorative flowers, chewing her cables and headphones to the point where they don\u2019t work, and that her chair is still ruined and she wants reimbursement for it.  i showed my parents and they agreed to 100% pay for a new chair if she gave us the ruined chair. this chair really isn\u2019t \u201cruined,\u201d it just has a few little holes that i could probably crudely fix with glue. we assumed she was going to scrap the chair because of how she presented it (\u201che (my cat) fucked it up\u201d) but I didn\u2019t want it to go to waste. i also could sell the chair for some of the money back. she said she wants to keep the ruined chair. when my mom saw that she said this, she flipped out. i understand why. my mom said that\u2019s basically giving her a gift, not a reimbursement. my roommate said she wanted to keep the chair so that she can have one chair in her room at the apartment, and one in her room at her parents house so she doesn\u2019t have to bring it back and forth.  the way she worded this ircked me a lot. my parents 100% agreed that if she doesn\u2019t give us her ruined chair, we are not paying anything for a new one for her. she\u2019s really mad at this. when i got home she was crying about how her stuff is ruined, and how my cat got into her cables and broke her headphones. i told her she should keep her door closed from now on like our other roommates do, that way there\u2019s no chance he\u2019ll (my cat) get in and he\u2019ll get used to not being in the room, like he did with our other roommates. she kept the door open, and low and behold he walked right into her room. she then cried more about him being in there.  i\u2019m going to keep my cat in my room from now on, only letting him out when i\u2019m home to supervise. he has plenty of toys, wall shelves to climb, and things to do in my room. everything is in here, so it\u2019ll just be a bit of an adjustment for him. she\u2019s been texting me for the entire rest of the night talking about how her stuff is ruined and shes saying things like \u201cwhat do i do?\u201d and \u201ci don\u2019t know what to do\u201d. i\u2019m starting to think she\u2019s trying to guilt me into giving her the money. am i overreacting to this? should i give her the money? i dont know what to do.  EDIT: I should probably add that my roommate will actively seek out my cat while he\u2019s in my room to bring into her room, that\u2019s where the problem lies. I try to keep him separated from precious materials, but I\u2019m not always there to supervise.  my cat is NOT destructive as most people are saying. he has never ripped apart anything. her chair is the thing she\u2019s upset about, but the only other thing my cat has gotten into is her headphone cable. but my cat doesn\u2019t go around chewing and scratching things. he didn\u2019t scratch her chair, either. it was holes poked from him walking on it and putting out his claws a bit. neither me nor my other roommates have ever had a problem.  EDIT/UPDATE: 2/6/25 Thanks guys for the comments. I took lots of your advice and me and my roommate were able to \u201ctalk it out\u201d (she came to me and apologized profusely). I think my roommates mom is still upset though, because her mom called MY mom and bitched about it apparently. I wasn\u2019t there, but that\u2019s what my mom said happened. Anyways thanks a bunch for helping me not spiral into a panic attack! ",

        "selftext": "I really didn\u2019t mean to cause any harm with this, but I\u2019m 24 hours everything has blown up. I (17f) had the first day of school yesterday. It\u2019s my final year of high school, and I\u2019m pretty involved with school clubs, so I know a lot of people even though I\u2019m not popular and not involved with much drama, until no. On the way home I saw some friends I hadn\u2019t talked to over the holidays and while chatting one of them brought up a girl we can call Layla (16f). Two of my friends had heard that Layla was telling people her sister Cassidy (18f) who graduated last year is now pregnant. I knew Cassidy and even though we weren\u2018t close friends, she was always super nice. None of us really believed it, but they had both heard it separately, and thought it was weird. I thought since Cassidy wasn\u2019t at school to defend herself or even hear about it, someone should tell her that people in Y11 and Y12 were hearing it. So I dm\u2019d her on instagram telling her what I\u2019d heard, said I didn\u2019t believe it, and didn\u2019t really expect a response. She messaged me back thanking me and asking a few question, and I thought I\u2019d done the right thing. Apparently not, because today Layla found me at lunch and yelled at me for messaging her sister. Turns out their mum saw the message and now they have family drama, and are blaming Cassidy for the rumour being spread, not Layla. Layla said she had no idea the rumour was spreading at all, and she had no part in it. Layla also said I had no right inserting myself in family drama, and if the I heard one of Cassidy\u2019s friends spread the rumour it would have been fine, but since I thought it was her, I should have gone to Layla first, not Cassidy. She was yelling so loud and for so long teachers got involved and tried to set up meetings for us and potentially our parents as well, but I said it wasn\u2019t necessary. I apologised to Layla for causing family drama, but said I didn\u2019t feel bad for telling Cassidy what was being said about her, because I thought she deserved to find out as soon as possible. Layla said I wasn\u2019t Cassidy\u2019s friend, and not to see her, talk to her, or message her again. Even so, I messaged Cassidy an apology for starting family drama, which I am genuinely sorry for. She hasn\u2019t responded, and I don\u2019t expect her to. But even so, I don\u2019t think I was the asshole for telling Cassidy there was a pregnancy rumour about her.   EDIT for clarity: Cassidy is not pregnant and Layla said she didn\u2019t start it or tell anyone",

        "selftext": "My 20(F) Boyfriend 23(M) have been dating seriously for about 6 months now.He lives about an hour away from me which was never a problem in the past when we have drove to see each other. Recently he has been working a lot and has been asking if I could drive to his place more frequently, because he is usually very exhausted as he works a very physically demanding job. Me, wanting to be an understanding girlfriend, has had zero problem with driving to see him, as he is truly my favorite person and I love seeing him.  Side note, neither of us are financially unstable, we both have great paying jobs and both have willingly supportive families if we ever needed help.  I think I drive to his place far more often and I have never had a problem with the drive taking up all my gas, unless there is massive amounts of traffic that causes me to be driving for almost 3 hours on the way back home. But even then, i'll just buy gas myself as I have no problem with it being wasted on him.  Last week, I had a talk w/ him asking if he could possibly drive up to me this time as I had an incredibly busy few weeks ahead and would really appreciate it as we haven't seen each other in a while, since I haven't driven to see him in a minute. He agreed in a very sullen tone, that kinda irked me but I remembered that he is very consistently exhausted from work, and brushed it off.  Until yesterday, the day we agreed for him to drive up comes, and on his way to me I get a call that consisted of him complaining about how this drive took up a lot of his gas, and he said quote,  You need to pay me gas money for this trip, for here and back. I, being confused, asked, Is there a lot of traffic? He responded, No, just driving all this way has sucked up all my gas and I feel like it's only fair for you to compensate me. I reply, I get that, but I've just never personally asked you for it before. He responds, Well if you did, I would.  I said that we would talk about it once he gets here, trying to avoid a disagreement, but instead he decides to hang up on me and I guess turns around. I check our shared life360 about 30 minutes later when he was supposed to get to my house, and it shows him already almost back at his house. I tried to call him multiple times, but he only texted me that I was being unfair and ridiculous. AITA? UPDATE: Im so glad this was over quickly, I just posted this literally last night.  One of his friends who also uses reddit luckily stumbled across my post, and immediately recognized it to be me, due to my username and just him knowing of me and my former boyfriends driving situation.  He messaged me today and told me everything my then boyfriend NOW EX, was hiding from me for the past 6 months. Turns out, my now ex HAS NEVER HAD A JOB. HIS JOB was him going and banging his stupid ass ex girlfriend all the time. He was actually fully reliant on his parents money, and recently got cut off, due to him just being an absolute trash human being, which I see now. That's his reason for begging for gas money all of a sudden, and why he seemed so checked out from this relationship as so many of you were saying in the comments.  BTW, i've never met his parents before, and now I understand why, his parents never knew about me, he was using me all this time, for literally no reason basically, we weren't together for that long. Also, some of you might think I would know if my so called boyfriend didn't actually have a job, but we only talked for a month before getting into a committed relationship, It's not like we have known each other for years. It's pretty easy to hide a fake job, and somehow he did it perfectly the maniac he is.  You may think it's suspicious why his so called friend decided to spill this all to me so quick, and it's because my former boyfriends ex he's been cheating on me with, is the friends ex. He knew about me, but didn't know the ex who my former boyfriend was seeing was THAT ex, that they had a early fallout about in their friendship. We are both equally pissed and now me and him are thinking about ways we can get mild revenge, and I'll update with the plans and execution of the plans later. I wasn't just gonna take the easy route of breaking up with him, he doesn't deserve the easy way out.",

        "selftext": "Hello! Longtime lurker, first time poster here. I (25F) went to a friend\u2019s wedding a few months ago. The friends are Matt (25M), and Susan (25F). We\u2019re all part of a much larger friend group that gets along pretty great. To preface, I have actually never attended a wedding before in my life, and I don\u2019t tend to dress up or put on makeup. Nothing against it, it\u2019s just expensive and time consuming and I work 16-hour days in a uniform. I was really excited when I got the invite, saved up, and went to a shop I know carries my size (I\u2019m fairly tall). The clerk was amazing and so helpful. He chose a selection of dresses that would be wedding appropriate that weren\u2019t close to what the bridal party would be wearing and we had a lot of fun trying things on and he hyping me up. One of the options I just fell in love with. It was a beautiful dark green silk \u201cbias-cut\u201d dress (think Kiera Knightley in Atonement, without the sash and less of a flowing skirt). We matched it with heels and I\u2019d never felt prettier. The dress was on sale too, so that was a plus! Wedding day comes and it\u2019s lovely. I\u2019m so happy for my friends. Susan ignores me, which is weird, but she\u2019s busy preparing and then the wedding is in full swing and the reception is busy so I don\u2019t think much of it. Everything goes off without a hitch and they drive off to their honeymoon. I suppose it\u2019s relevant, but I received several compliments on my outfit during the event. I didn\u2019t think it caused a scene, and it wasn\u2019t anything particularly effusive or over the top. I was doing the same to others so I didn\u2019t think it stood out.Everything concludes, we all have a nice time. No one says anything until tonight. We all got together for a \u201cWelcome Back!\u201d dinner for Matt and Susan. During the dinner Susan kept making snipes at me about what I wore, just incredibly passive aggressive. It was very clear she thought I overdressed. I didn\u2019t say anything at the time because I felt terrible. None of my friends corrected or stopped her either. But looking back on it I feel\u2026 wronged? She didn\u2019t give me the benefit of the doubt and I don\u2019t feel like my dress was over-the-top. I do think I likely look very different from how I normally dress and present myself, so that might be part of it?  I\u2019m trying not to go over the word limit but am very open to questions and elaborations if needed.  So Reddit, AITA?  TLDR: wore a nice dress to a wedding, the bride is angry ever since. AITA?  Alright, my update was way too long and I honestly don\u2019t know if I can shorten it and it still give all the details - so I\u2019m going to be posting it on my own profile. ",

Our mutual friends are split some say I saved Cherry\u2019s life and didn't have anything better I could have done, others say I overstepped by not waiting longer coz it's not like a dog could die that quick. Alma is now ignoring me and told everyone we know that I \u201cforced her into debt.\u201d  AITA?",

After practice most of the guys take a shower before heading to classes.  I was having a chat with a couple of the other guys on the team and getting changed at the same time. When I pulled down my pants one of the guys just said 'WTF dude' in a really shocked tone. I asked what the matter was. He said to go find a stall if I wanted to do that, or don't bother changing underwear.  Now, I sweat like crazy so obviously wanted to change underwear. But the stalls were being occupied and I didn't think it was expected to wait. It's a changing room, in my experience people change. It's not that big of a deal. We all shower after swim practice and nobody cares in the slightest. I'm comfortable in my own body and didn't think it was a big deal, but obviously don't want to make others uncomfortable either.

        "selftext": "Let's jump into this: I (29F) gave birth to my 3rd baby in November.  The women in my husband's family (his 2 sisters, our sil, and his mom) and I have a group chat whereas we send pictures of our kids, tell funny stories about our day, and, in this case, send updates about possible labor.  On this particular day in November, at 37 weeks plus 5 days gestation, I reached out to inform that this just might be the day my newest baby decides to make his grand entrance. I had been having strong contractions since 5:50 that morning.  Everyone, except sil (my husband's brother's wife) responded with excitement and praying hands emoji's.  Well, according to the nurses at the hospital, I wasn't dilated enough to be admitted, despite strong and frequent contractions.This was at noon. I updated the chat. Everyone seemed concerned and asked if I still thought if it might still be that day.  I assured it was most likely going to happen that day, judging from past experiences, but I would go home to labor in comfort. This is where i might be the a-hole.  My sil, who also gave birth to her 3rd baby a couple months prior (via c-section. I am not judging nor think of her as less than, just context is key) decided to text how glad she was that I wasn't in real labor and that it's better that I wait to have the baby another couple of weeks. She then sent a bunch of screen shots and links to articles about false labor and Braxton hicks. AS IF I HAD NEVER GIVEN BIRTH BEFORE OR EXPERIENCED PREGNANCY BEFORE. I replied, mid contraction:  Not to be bity, but this ain't my first rodeo, and I know how to Google things as well.  And yes, I have been checked, and they will check again before deciding IF I should go home or not. Well, I did go home, only to go back to the hospital a couple of hours later and had my baby at 10:15 that night.  Sil does not reply to me in texts, and has since unfriended me on Facebook. (Not that I really care about that.)  I just want to know it I was an a-hole for what I said... and, in hindsight, perhaps I shouldn't have been texting in the groupchat while in labor.  So, reddit. Was I an a-hole? Edit: I meant to elaborate on the c-section detail. Which definitely makes me come across as someone who looks down on her for it. Which I do not.  Her first baby was a preemie and she had an emergency c-section. Her youngest 2 were scheduled. The point I was trying to make was that our experiences with pregnancy and childbirth are completely different.  Which, I could have said without the c-section fact. My apologies.  Edit: a little more info about my sil and my relationship. She thinks she's the matriarch of the family, even if she won't admit it. We recently moved out of state (only 2 hours away, long drive, but not as long as they treat it), a few months before I gave birth, and she started cutting us out of family get together and even created a whole new group chat without my husband and me. She is always shocked at how intelligent my husband is because he went to community college instead of a university, like she did. I didn't go to college. I saw no point in going into debt, I didn't know what I would go to college for, so I decided to wait. So she often treats me like I am unintelligent.  I think the snappy text was probably long incoming. But it was poorly timed and shouldn't have been in a group chat.It was not the first time I had gone off on her in a group chat either. She singled me out a few months prior, questioning my ability to care for my kids by myself while my husband was away for a couple of days.  Yes, in the big family group chat.So I snapped back. My husband saw the message before me and said I'll let you handle her. As he held me back many times beforehand to keep peace. Like I said, it was possibly poorly timed but long incoming. ",

She made a joke of it and hid under the blankets. We have a king size bed,  have a toddler that sleeps between us, and my wife keeps a pillow between her and the toddler. I was trying to show my wife that her and her pillow already took up over half of the bed, leaving me with little to no space, especially once or toddler laid down.  I tried telling her I needed more room but she kept making a joke of it. So I got in bed, grabbed the pillow she keeps at her back and tossed it into the hallway saying here this will help. The next thing I know my wife is furious, crying, and is gathering her other pillows and blanket saying if I'm that much of a problem you can just have the bed to yourself. Her and our toddler went to the toddler's room to sleep (that bed is a full). This morning my wife is still mad and barely speaking to me so I ask AITA for throwing my wife's pillow out of the room? TLDR- wife takes up over half the bed with pillow wall between us, I tossed the divider pillow out of the room to allow myself more space. ",

My mom was a drug addict, stopping during pregnancy, but when Mj was about 5 months old she started back on drugs, dropping Mj off any place she could. Seeing this I wanted to give Mj a life that she deserved, not what our mother gave me, even though I was only 19, i filed a petition to get custody of her, it was a long hard process but when Mj was 2 i finally got full custody, all this to say, im legally Mj\u2019s dad. Im the only dad she knows and she calls me dad. A year ago I met my girlfriend, Ida (24f) and we started dating not long after, I really thought I found somebody to like me and Mj, Ida would always take Mj on \u2018girls days\u2019 and  little \u2018dates\u2019. I proposed to Ida on Sunday, it seemed like everything was great until a few hours ago. Ida was at my apartment having dinner with me and Mj, well when i was cooking dinner I heard Mj say something along the lines of \u2018Your gonna marry my daddy and your gonna be best friend\u2019 I thought it was cute until I heard Ida laugh and say \u2018He\u2019s not your dad Mj\u2019 which caught me off guard, i guess she thought i couldn\u2019t hear her because there\u2019s one a wall between the kitchen, but still i don\u2019t know why Ida said that. Mj was confused as 5 year olds are said I was and Ida kept correcting her until Mj started crying, Which honestly made me mad, I asked Ida why she would even say that and Ida stated \u2018She was going to find out eventually\u2019 and I was an arse for not telling Mj in the first place. I got mad and one thing led to another i said somethings i shouldn\u2019t have, telling her she had no right and Ida went home and Me and Mj had dinner alone, Ida started blowing up my phone later saying what I did was \u2018wrong\u2019 and basically was just ranting to me through text, I started doubting myself and now i\u2019m here. So AITA (I was gonna tell Mj i was her brother someday, yes, but when shes old enough to understand, Mj is only 5 she doesn\u2019t make sense of it) (Also sorry if im bad at explaining)",

We've managed two days so far, where even if he accidentally says something in English I answer in German, but last night he told me he needed a break from me speaking German. I refused, and said it's only for 10 weeks until my exam, then I'll go back to English. He says I don't sound like his wife when I speak German. I asked if it was because my mistakes were jarring or my vocab was causing issues. He said it just 'didn't feel like he was speaking to his wife'.

        "selftext": "Two years ago I saw an original watercolor piece that I liked and I contacted the artist and bought it. When the piece arrived I sought a frame for it, but I hadn\u2019t been able to find a frame for that size every time I went to the store. They were all too big or too small. So I just kept the piece in an envelope in my desk, I would sometimes look at it, remember I had to find a frame for it but would later forget again. Work, family and life leaves little time to devote to thinking about a frame for a painting and I don\u2019t have any framing businesses near me, so that wasn\u2019t either an option. Today my boyfriend is dusting and comes out of the office showing me the painting on a spare frame he had been using for something else. I ask him if that frame is 9x12. He tells me it\u2019s 8x10, that he had to cut a piece of the artwork to make it fit. When I look at it the piece went from a centralized composition to having the composition indented to the left side because he cut all whole inch on that side to save the artist\u2019s signature which was on the extreme opposite end (for reference, imagine I if you cut the Mona Lisa to the point where her head is no longer in the center). When he notices I\u2019m perplexed he nonchalantly tells me that the painting was in an envelope anyway, and it\u2019s better if it\u2019s out so we can see it. I get mad because this is not the first time he has taken something of mine and given it away, offer it to someone or just not ask and do whatever he wants with it. His mother does the same thing with his things at her house. In their family if you\u2019re not using something anyone can do with it as they please. I explained to him in my family you don\u2019t do anything with other people\u2019s stuff I have a tendency to ruminate on thoughts, so I try not to engage in negative emotions because then I just can\u2019t let go of them and I cycle and cycle through them and it makes my life miserable, and I have to devote a lot of energy to get me back to normal. Every time I looked at the framed painting I felt a new wave of sadness, anger and frustration ripple over me. So I took the frame down, took the painting out of it, ripped it into four pieces and threw it in the garbage. When my boyfriend saw it he was shocked and visibly hurt. I get that his intentions were good, but he ruined a piece of art that was not his to begin with. Now it\u2019s awkward at home because I\u2019m still fuming and he\u2019s sad. AITAH",

During the day I work out of a spare room and he works out of the living room, so during work hours these two spaces essentially work as two offices. I will refer to the room I work in as my office for simplicity sakes but it is not the exclusive use of that room and there is a second bathroom that can only be accessed through the spare room. I scare extremely easily. I usually keep the door open unless one of us is on a call, but very frequently my husband will walk into the room and scare me really badly. Like I'll *scream* and jump and for a few seconds I genuinely cannot control my reaction, like I feel like I almost white out for a second sometime it scares me so bad. I dont handle it very well, a good scare will leave me shaking for hours after. I know I'm very weak to being scared and that its an unreasonable reaction but I genuinely cannot control it. I have some trauma in my past that contributes, but I am working with a therapist. My partner takes a great deal of offence to my reactions, even though I try to explain I cant control them. Sometimes when he startles me like that I'll say something like Why did you do that? or why do you keep doing that? as a reaction and that hurts his feelings. I always apologize and try to assure him its not personal, its just what comes out of my mouth when I'm scared but I can tell it really bothers him. I've asked him to just pause and knock before he comes in but thats not really fair to make him stop and knock in his own house to enter a room that isnt exclusively for my use. The scares are bad enough that they can greatly impact my work day. I know this seems extreme, but a good scare makes me feel like my brain turns off for a while after until I get ahold of myself again. I suggested this morning, after a good scare, that maybe I should get a motion sensor door chime like they have at shops! I could install it in the hall just before my door and put the noise maker on my desk so that I'll hear the noise and know he's coming. My Partner thinks that thats over the top but I want to find a solution that will work. Would I be the asshole if I just bought a chime and set it up? edit: I'm reading everything as it comes in this is just a lot of messages thank you! edit2: sorry, I'm like, a little overwhelmed. A lot of people are saying he's doing it on purpose and I hadnt thought of that and I'm more than entertaining that idea. I'm gonna try my best to reply to comments, thank you Those curious about the Brad story it doesnt have an interesting conclusion but if enough people care I will post an FAQ over on ask reddit.",

She tried to keep it quiet but she paid off my dad\u2019s debts, bought him a small house, paid off her debts and paid for my sister\u2019s college and set up funds for mine.  She had a boyfriend at the time and shortly after him and his son who was 7 moved into our new house. Over the next few years mom bought my sister a house after she graduated college. Her boyfriend lived with us and didn\u2019t pay anything but he did work. When I was 21 mom got diagnosed with cancer. It wasn\u2019t good. She sat me and my sister down and went over exactly how much money there was. She intended to give her current house to me and both me and my sister were left with a large sum at the end of it.  She asked if I would allow her boyfriend to stay in the house with his son until he got his own place. I agreed. Before she died she told her boyfriend he would need to look for his own place but had time to save more for that journey. For the last 4 years he has continued to reside in the house with his son. I haven\u2019t minded because we get along okay. I pay all the bills but he does buy food for him and his kid. He has dated off and on and mostly kept the women out of this house which I respected him for.  Until his current partner.  She\u2019s been in my house 3 times and at first besides feeling a little uncomfortable I was okay with her. The last time this past weekend was the point where I lost my shit. I was making myself some lunch when she came walking downstairs. She grabbed a plate and went to grab food out of my pan. I asked her what she thought was doing. She started telling me how I should look for somewhere else to live and leeching off my dead mom\u2019s past relationship as an adult was pathetic. I hollered for my mom\u2019s old boyfriend he came down and I told him I didn\u2019t know what he current thing thought but I wasn\u2019t going to be disrespected in my house.  He wouldn\u2019t even look me in the eyes as he mumbled something about my mom promising him the house and he was just \u201cbeing kind\u201d letting me stay. First that isn\u2019t remotely true. Mom pulled him and i together after she asked if he could stay to set expectations. My mom met him shortly before she won the money and told him and us girls that she had no intention of leaving him money. She did set aside a fund for his son for college when he gets there but he cannot touch it, only his son can.  He has lived in this house almost 8 years without paying a dime he should have plenty of money and if he doesn\u2019t that\u2019s on him. I told him he had 30 days to leave. I wasn\u2019t going to house someone who would lie and disrespect me in my house. He left that night with his son but his ex wife called to tell me I am cruel and an AH for her son losing his house (he is here every other week). I really feel like my mom didn\u2019t expect him to still be here but my sister said she feels like I am breaking my promise to my mom and  that made me feel like maybe I am the AH.",

Husband has never had a day alone with son so I asked him to try to figure it out but I\u2019ll be available if needed. He told his mother to come and help. I said no. He thinks I\u2019m ridiculous.  I (30F) and my husband (33M) welcomed our first child this past September. I have been fortunate to be on maternity leave but that ends next week. My husband had 2 months off and has been working full time since. He\u2019s off on Sundays and Mondays. I have never left my son except to go to a wedding in December but we were only away for 3 of his wake hours. My in laws watched over him and everything was fine.  I go back to work next week and my son will be attending day care. My husband is off this entire week and we\u2019ve just been taking a staycation. I told my husband though I want one day on my own to get more comfortable from being away from our baby and that I want him to have the day with the baby on his own. He has never been alone with him for more than an hour. He is a good father though and will help out when needed. But he has never been there for the full blown cries and fussiness while having to take care of the house.  A few days ago, we went to a friends house and our son was screaming bloody hell. Whenever I held him, he would calm down. Whenever my husband held him, he would just scream and cry even louder. So my husband just passed him along to me. I was getting frustrated cause I just wanted to relax with friends and he couldn\u2019t calm him down for a minute.  Today he tells me that his mom will be coming to help out. I asked him to tell her never mind cause he should be able to do it on his own. He called me ridiculous and it shouldn\u2019t matter but I think it really does. I can\u2019t be bothered at work unless absolutely necessary so I wanted t this to be our \u201ctrial\u201d. His mom will also be working on Mondays so it\u2019s not like she will be available to help out then. His mom is taking his side but of course she will cause our son is her only grandson.  So AITA for telling husband to figure it out and step up?  This is my first AITA post and I\u2019m frustrated just writing this so if you need more details to decide, just let me know and I\u2019ll respond.  ETA- I had a c section and I exclusively breastfed so I physically could not leave the baby in the first 2 months. My lactation consultant told me not to pump until after 2 months as I needed to establish my milk supply. He took care of my while I took care of baby. He doesn\u2019t do NOTHING. When I started pumping, husband was already at work. Husband does do feedings now.  ETA2 - this isn\u2019t a punch towards his mother. I adore her. It\u2019s really about him being independent with the baby. She helps us and I always appreciate it. Idk why yall think I\u2019m spiteful.  ETA3 - When my husband is home, I do separate myself from them by going to a different room. But he does often come to the room for help. I\u2019m not just dropping him off. ",

        "selftext": "I (28F) and my fianc\u00e9 (36M) are planning our wedding, and last night he accused me of being greedy and rude. Background: I come from a wealthy family and have worked hard to manage finances responsibly. My father has given each daughter $120K for their wedding. My sisters used all of it for their weddings, but I asked to use $70K for the wedding and $10K for a honeymoon, saving $40K to help with future children\u2019s expenses. My dad agreed to this plan, but only if I could make the wedding work with that budget. I didn\u2019t make this decision lightly. When I first got engaged five months ago, I considered using the full amount for a European wedding, but I realized I didn\u2019t want to prioritize that. A wedding is one day, and securing our future financial stability seemed more important. My fianc\u00e9 has been patient but has accused me of delaying the wedding due to indecisiveness, though I\u2019m just overwhelmed by spending so much on one day and managing everything else. Last night, I asked him to help review venues for a tour we\u2019re doing Monday. He rushed through options, and I started to cry from stress. I also wanted to vet the venues\u2019 prices before booking, but this frustrated him. He said I was rude for not wanting to use all the money for a wedding he would love, claiming that going over budget was fine because this was our most important day. He has always dreamed of a grand wedding with lots of guests. He criticized the venue I liked, an old library that only seats 180 and fits our budget. He said I was being rude by limiting my guest list to 60 people so he could invite 120 of his family. He also accused me of being \u201cgreedy\u201d for wanting to save the leftover money and said I looked like I was hoarding it. He argued that since we are financially well-off, I shouldn\u2019t worry about saving for future children. He also mentioned that our wedding planner had supposedly said I was being greedy, though he later admitted to making that up to show me how rude I was being. I thought I was being fiscally responsible by saving the extra money, but now I\u2019m questioning if I\u2019ve made the right decision. AITA?",

        "selftext": "I\u2019m going to jump right in because the funeral is this Friday. My ex husband passed away last week in a car accident, very unexpectedly. The troopers came to my house (I\u2019m his emergency contact) to break the news. The first person I called was his father, and he flew out the next day with my exs sister. Before he flew out he asked me where we should have the service, in texas (where we live) or back in Maryland where our families and friends all still live.  I told him I felt like the service needed to be in Maryland because that was where everyone was and P (my exes father) agreed. He let me know the funeral home said they might be able to do a small viewing with just family and I agreed to doing that as long as I felt like he was in a condition he\u2019d be ok with.  I met my exes sister and his dad at the funeral home to go over paperwork and plan the viewing, he told me all the details for the funeral back home and we talked a bit about where my ex worked, his day to day life, his home, and the probate process. His father was taking care of the probate process and seemed defensive about some of his belongings, I really felt like focusing on my children was more important than arguing over small things in the home\u2026 all of that could wait so I backed off of helping with cleaning out him home and handed all of his insurance paperwork and other information I had that would be useful to them like contacts at his work and his electric login.  We had the viewing, both of our children said goodbye to their dad and it was very emotional. At the viewing I mentioned that a friend had paid for our tickets to fly home as I was quickly realizing how much everything was going to cost and I suddenly was without the financial help of their dad.. I was extremely thankful for their generosity.  After the viewing I didn\u2019t hear anything from his sister or dad, they didn\u2019t ask to see the kids or let me know what was going on with the process and I was actively trying to navigate the life insurance process while grieving my ex and helping my children with their feelings. The last few days have been a blur of crying and anger for all of us, we are so heartbroken to have lost him.  My exes sister and father flew out on Friday and around noon I got a call from his father telling me we were not welcome at the funeral and that my children and I would be a distraction to his (my exes father) families grieving.  I\u2019m shocked and hurt, I told him I had never heard anything so hateful and the conversation was over.  My exes father and sister have never visited texas, we\u2019ve lived here for 4 years. They were not close and had no idea where he worked, or even any recent photos of him. We were divorced but still good friends, and my ex was a devoted father. His children were his world.  AITA for not listening to his father and still taking them? The funeral is open to anyone, I can\u2019t imagine us being there among hundreds of other people will really be a problem.  Edit: for those asking his reason, he said \u201cwell I gave you a nice service here\u201d -we had a short viewing only and had previously agreed to the service being in Maryland so no, there was no service.  Also for clarity I am the beneficiary on the policies, my ex and I did his open enrollment together every year and we put each other as our beneficiaries to make it easier if anything like this ever did happen  I have a wrongful death attorney and he is helping me with the process but I will reach out to a probate attorney.  Thank you to everyone for the advice on SSI ",

Get up rubbing my eyes and check the hatch which is closed, no ladder present below hatch means no one got in there from the hatch. I put my ladder there and check the attic, empty. Hear something running on the roof at this point, prolly a cat. Get down, SO is panicking asking what I saw, tell her nothing in the attic, something maybe on the roof. She  wants to call the cops and is asking a 100 questions. Ask her to wait while I check it out to settle her down. I circle the house twice while shining a bright torch over the roof. Don't see anything there. Get inside house and explain I went around the house twice shining the torch on the roof. There is no one there. But I am bombarded with 'who was it then'? No one. 'who could it have been?' no one was there . 'what were they doing on the roof' I don't even know if someone was there. 'how could they have gotten up there' I don't know. 'how do you not know, take a guess' I don't think anyone was there, probably a cat running around. 'You need to go speak with the neighbors to see if they saw something while I call the cops' I am not going to wake the neighbors at 3am and you are not calling the cops, just go to bed. 'No you need to go speak with the neighbors because you don't know anything. You don't know who it was, what they were doing there, how they got up there' 'Listen, I don't know who was there. I cannot know this. I don't know what they were doing there, I cannot know this, I dont know how they got up there, if you want to ask hypothetically then maybe they flew there, they parachuted off a plane and landed there, maybe it was spiderman. I just don't know because I cannot know. I have walked around the house and found nothing. You think me waking the neighbor will solve the mystery even though he knows less than us?   She is pissed off now saying it was a stressful situation and that I should have been cooperative and understanding of her feelings but instead I was a real asshole.

        "selftext": "My baby shower is today and I was just told last night my aunt will be visiting for a few days from a different state and today is her birthday. Previous to last night I was unaware of her birthday or her even coming, then I was told my mother bought her A cake and plan on having everyone sing happy birthday at my shower. My issue is that there will be multiple strangers who have no clue who she is that will be forced to awkwardly sing to her, and they couldn\u2019t wait for another day. She is going to be here for a few days so Im confused why they couldn\u2019t simply take her to dinner after the event or a different day. When i expressed my concern my family implied I\u2019m being selfish and then proceeded to say I have no choice as I didn\u2019t pay for the shower. This is my first child and my family has made it clear this will be my one and only baby shower. So AITA for asking that this one event (not even the entire day just the event) to be about me only?  Edit: To everyone saying I should be happy to share this with my aunt because she came for me, I never said she came FOR me or for this shower. She just happens to be here and It would be a different situation if I were closer to this aunt but as previously mentioned im distant enough to have not even known it was her birthday. Also when this tia was originally told about my pregnancy she was insanely negative and criticizing telling me to possibly abort.  ",

        "selftext": "I'm pissed over this so please tell me if this makes no sense. I, (22F) have been with my incredible girlfriend, Layne (22F) for just over a year now. I introduced her to all my friends about four months in and since then she's been hanging out with us (seven including me) regularly. So, I have a friend, Freya (23F), who is kind of nosy. For a couple weeks, Layne has been out of town (before anyone asks, she didn't want me to come. I offered but she said she just needed to do this alone) for family issues I won't spill here, and Freya has been nagging me like crazy about it. Me and my friends all go to the same university, and we hangout pretty much everyday, so I can't avoid her.  First, I thought it started with honest concern. I told her what I said before, that she's out of town for some family stuff. Plain and simple. Subtly trying to get the idea across that it's none of her fucking business. She accepted that for all of one day. She then amped it up to pressing about exactly *what* the family thing is. I just kept shutting her down, calmly asking her to drop it, saying that Layne doesn't want her stuff being aired out like that (which she had explicitly told me). But she just wouldn't take no for an answer. Just kept insisting that it was fine if she knew, and I would just ignore her. Last night was my last straw. We were hanging out at a local bar when Layne called me. I told my friends I'd be back in a bit and went outside to take it. Layne was pretty upset, so I told her I'd get a cab and go home so I could fully focus on her. I quickly went back into the bar to tell my friends I had to go, mind you, I still had Layne on the line because I was only anticipating for it to take a minute. I just said something like Hey guys, but I gotta go, see you later, and pointed at the ongoing call. Freya, who was dead sober, decided it was a great idea to try to grab my phone from my hand, yelling questions at Layne. I backed up and held the phone to my chest, completely surprised because seriously what the fuck? I yelled at her to back off and told her my girlfriend's personal stuff was none of her business. She spluttered for a second, everyone else just staring at us bewildered before I just left. I talked to Layne on the way home and told her what happened, but said it was no big deal rn and refocused the conversation on what she needed to talk about. By the time I got home I had turned my phone on do not disturb and was facetiming Layne, so I didn't see the messages from my friends until today. Freya was pissed that I yelled at her, and two of our other friends, Toby (23M), and Clay (22M) shared the same sentiment of me embarrassing Freya by getting so angry at her when she was just worried about Layne. The rest of my friends were asking me if I was okay and siding with me. I just wanna know, despite my friends and Layne telling me Freya was totally weird for it, did I overreact? I'm starting to feel a bit guilty, I never *ever* yell like that.",

        "selftext": "So my (24f) mom is living with me since she got divorced a decade ago and has been struggling to manage things on her own since then. She lost her job in the summer and originally was looking a bunch for jobs but now isn\u2019t really doing that. But she met someone working for my apartment recently and they were talking a little bit for a few months. Now this talking was literally just seeing each other outside and chatting for a minute before going about their way.  Well she had him over for the first time on Christmas Eve 2024. We were find with that but requested he please not stay overnight since he\u2019s a stranger to us. She refused to kick him out and he stayed in our apartment the whole night. After that I tried to discuss with her some boundaries which I thought were reasonable. The only boundary I had was for him not to stay overnight until me and my sister got to know him better. She was mad at us for that and frequently argued with us and tried to plead with us but respected it.  But one night it was weird because she went to bed at 10pm then at 11 comes to get us saying he texted her wanting to come over and would we let him. We gently stated our boundary again and she said that she\u2019d already told him he could stay overnight. That hurt me a little but she ended up telling him to go back home. She was pissed though since he lives a few hours away and only comes to the apartment to work. But he could come over a couple nights a week and they\u2019d sleep together then he\u2019d leave before it got too late.  And some of why me and my sister requested this boundary is because our dad was notorious for having random people over when we\u2019d come for visitation as teenagers and not warning us beforehand.  And it\u2019s also weird because not once have they gone on a traditional date. They never go place together and my mom has no interest in it. It\u2019s only sex in her room a couple nights a week. And she\u2019s also been drinking a lot more since meeting him which concerns me because she\u2019s already jobless.  Final part of the story is that she says he just broke up with her because me and my sister wouldn\u2019t let him stay overnight. I tried to tell my mom we didn\u2019t mean never and just wanted to get to know him before a stranger sleeps in our apartment. I also think it\u2019s weird that he would rather not be with her than wait a little bit to sleep with her overnight. And keep in mind that they were seeing each other multiple times per week, just not overnight. My mom is pissed at me and begging me to let him stay overnight so she can get him back and giving me the whole spiel about how she has always taken care of us and this is how we repay her. Saying don\u2019t you care about my mental health and that he\u2019s the only thing that makes her happy.  This has been weighing on me for weeks so I really need to know\u2014 AITA for upholding my boundary?  ETA: adding a new section for where the guy lives to make it more clear since I shouldn\u2019t have buried it in long paragraphs. I don\u2019t want to reveal too much but he lives 3 hours away and his job involved traveling so he\u2019s down where we are on weekdays and doesn\u2019t have a permanent place up here.  ETA again: sorry guys I typed this all up in an emotional rush and probably didn\u2019t explain myself the best. Yeah of course we lived with my mom when I was 14 until college when I started paying most of the rent cause my mom was struggling. But me and my sister moved for a work opportunity a few years ago and our mom came with us since she didn\u2019t have much at our old place and couldn\u2019t pay rent alone so that\u2019s why we live together now. When the divorce happened we lost the house and have been living in apartments and people\u2019s basements since.  ",

        "selftext": "My (19f) friends and I all decided to go on a ski trip for a 12 days over winter break. We found a place to stay and all in all it was around $600 per person for the rental and we decided it was just easiest to have one person (me) put all the money upfront and just everyone pay me back before the actual trip, which everyone did. In my friend group we have a girl let\u2019s call Sarah. Sarah comes from a comfortable family and was even one of the people who suggested the trip and was one of the leading forces to finding the Air Bnb. Literally in the weeks leading up to the trip we were all fine, sending outfit ideas, restaurants to books etc. the Tuesday before we left (Saturday) Sarah starts sending texts to the gc like \u201cguys Jacob\u2019s (boyfriend) family is going to xxxxx next week\u201d basically sending us a LOT of details about where his family is going for winter vacation that we didn\u2019t really need to know. Then on Thursday (again we leave on Saturday) she texts the gc saying how she couldn\u2019t go because she had a family emergency, said her grandma had gotten admitted to the hospital . We were obviously bummed but family comes first and I told her that I would send her the money back that she sent towards the rental. We go on the trip and everything is ok until one of my friends who has Sarah\u2019s location on Life360 (roommates) sees that she\u2019s in a beach town and we put 2 and 2 together. We spend that night pissed and we call her out the next day where she admits everything. She had been last minute invited on her boyfriend\u2019s vacation and decided that she wanted to go to that instead but didn\u2019t know how to tell us. We were all obviously hurt and upset that she would choose a boy over us but at the end of the day she\u2019s a 19 year old girl so I guess it\u2019s just immaturity. The part that I\u2019m wondering if I\u2019m the asshole with is that after finding out that she voluntarily pulled out of the trip, I had told her I wouldn\u2019t be refunding her the $600 she had sent me for the rental. She pulled out so last minute that we couldn\u2019t find anything cheaper and I said I was ok just wasting that money because again I thought she was having a family emergency. After finding out that she wouldn\u2019t be getting that back she went insane and started calling me a bad friend and everything. My parents think I should send it back to her but I don\u2019t see why I should, she pulled out because of her boyfriend and expected us to all just absorb the costs?? ",

        "selftext": "So let me start off with I'm pretty bad at checking the details on my bank statements, but recently something wasn't right. So I went through every single one for the past year, and there were over 100 charges from PlayStation. I only had 4 purchases on my 2 PS accounts in a single year, so I panicked as someone had my cc info. In all, the total charges were around 1500. I contacted both of my siblings who's kids also have accounts and asked nicely if their kids may have purchased anything using my bank account before i make a dispute. Both said no, so I went ahead and called both PS and my bank. The bank was able to chargeback past few months and rest is under investigation. Well a few days later I get a frantic call from my teenage nephew who says his PS account was perma banned. I asked him if he was sure he didn't buy anything with a cc after I gave him a several hundred dollars PS giftcard for his birthday this summer to spend on stuff, he again denied. So I have his email logins and sure enough, it was purchases he made to his account. All the stuff he plays. Then he starts to say maybe he bought a few items here and there.  Now my sister is pissed at me. She says I must have added my cc info to buy him something at some point in time, and it was all my fault he was making purchases from my card. If it were her cc, she'd get an alert. Never that he may have taken my cc info, no. She doesn't want him to lose his account, and said she'll call PS to pay for it all. She said he always asks and she gets alerts and doesn't understand that I didn't, so I shouldn't blame him. I said well he knew he was spending someone else's money, so why is it my fault? And that he stopped asking her for permission to make purchases because no one stopped him. After that she said I was blaming her kid for everything. So AITA here? ##Edit:  Info:He is almost 15.I'm unsure of how he got my payment info. ##Update! After an intense argument, she was still denying he made the charges at all. I was finally able to show her each and every transaction (before I had only explained and she didn't believe me). After seeing the evidence, he finally fessed up. He claimed he thought it was HER card \ud83e\udd2a. She will be paying me for all the money he used on my account and will not be getting the PS5 back, until he works to pay it off. Even then she may not let him have it. He insists that he will be paying us both double for our troubles. But the real damage done here is the trust I have in both of them.",

        "selftext": "I (25F) am child-free so maybe there is some aspect of parenthood that I\u2019m missing here. My friend Stacy (26F) had her first baby about 9 months ago,  Hailey. Stacy and I had some tension brewing in our friendship since she was pregnant. In the past, my time and energy had been very much available to Stacy. At times I felt that she took advantage of my empathy and willingness to bend over backwards for her. She lived about an hour away, and was always in some form of drama or crisis. I drove up to be with her nearly every single weekend, and the times when I told her I couldn\u2019t for one reason or another, she would beg and usually guilt me with things like \u201cI\u2019m in such a dark place, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll do if I\u2019m alone, I really need this\u201d. She also did a lot of passive aggressive shutting down from conversation when she didn\u2019t get what she wanted, leading me to always give in and put my own needs aside. This went on for years. I grew tired of this pattern and started therapy, where I learned to set healthy boundaries, speak up, and prioritize myself when it was important. These changes led me to cut the weekends I spent with her in half. I was in the process of buying a house, starting a new job and masters program, on top of family issues. I knew that she saw the change in our friendship and wasn\u2019t happy about it, but thought that with time she would understand and adjust. She never did, and insinuated that I changed because I didn\u2019t support her pregnancy or because my partner was manipulating me into not spending time with her. I explained to her many times that this wasn\u2019t the case and that I am doing all I can to be there for her.  Things came to a head when I had a health scare. I told her about it, and the next day she tried to call me. I was on the phone with someone else and couldn\u2019t answer, but texted her immediately after to let her know and make sure that everything was okay. She once again got upset because I didn\u2019t answer right away, and I had had it. On the very rare occasion that I ask for support from her she had to make it about herself. I didn\u2019t usually call her out but this time I did. I told her I didn\u2019t understand why she had an attitude, she said \u201cthanks for making me cry\u201d and then didn\u2019t respond to me for over a month. Then, when she finally did, she didn\u2019t ask about my health. She didn\u2019t apologize or even bother explaining. She instead accused me of using her daughter as a pawn by not acknowledging her. She said that Hailey didn\u2019t deserve absolutely no effort just because her and I were in a fight, and that it was so messed up that I would add Hailey into the equation. I\u2019m so confused. Hailey had nothing to do with the fight, and Stacy was the one who had ignored me for over a month. What was I supposed to do in this scenario? I can\u2019t text a 9 month old or just show up at their house. I\u2019m genuinely lost, can someone please explain this to me? AITA? \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-(EDIT) Update:Thank you for all of the comments and advice! I especially appreciate the vulnerablility of those who shared their experiences from both sides of this situation. Stacy and I have been friends for a decade, and I have long speculated that Stacy\u2019s behavior stems from her past traumas and mental health. This is a huge reason I could never bring myself to abandon her or criticize the ways she copes with life, albeit unhealthy. Although I can empathize with her experience and care about her deeply, you all helped me see that with no end in sight, it\u2019s not a sustainable friendship for me to continue. I decidedly to be brutally honest with Stacy and of course, things ended in flames. I explained that her using Hailey to guilt trip me was manipulative and crossed the line, and that it is reflective of her behavior toward me throughout our friendship. I have done my best to be a good friend but find it impossible to meet the expectations she has for me that she doesn\u2019t even seem to apply to herself. I initially said I needed some distance from her, but her response was even worse than I imagined possible and the situation is now irredeemable. Some of my favorite lines were \u201cit is all about me and my family, get that through your f*cking head\u201d and \u201cif you don\u2019t want to be my doormat, don\u2019t let the door hit you on the way out.\u201d As well as letting me know what other people say about me behind my back and that I was meant to be Hailey\u2019s godmother but she couldn\u2019t bring herself to ask me because of what an absent friend I am. She has been blocked. I\u2019m devastated and relieved, and know I\u2019m not totally blameless for remaining silent and letting resentment build for so long. Thank you Reddit!",

        "selftext": "My best friend\u2014let's call her Elle\u2014and I have been close for 10ish years, and during that time, she's been in a couple of relationships but has been single for a few years now. Amongst our friends, Elle is the only unmarried one. She's made it clear that she's unhappy with being single, sincerely hopes to get into a serious relationship, and get married sooner rather than later. I can understand her frustrations, especially since she's the only single friend, wants kids someday, and so on.    About a month ago, Elle told me that she intends to be more proactive with dating this year and asked if I had anyone to introduce her to. Unfortunately, I don't, but another friend mentioned knowing a great guy (who I happen to have met before) who's single, and looking for something serious.  Elle was introduced (via text) to the guy, and they soon started talking on the phone. Elle says he has a lot of good attributes (e.g. very educated, high salary) but she finds him completely unattractive because they're the same height (he's 5'7 and she's 5'7) and because of his darker skin tone. I tried to convince her that his height and looks shouldn't take precedence over his personality, but this soon led to a major revelation on her dating standards that left me completely dumbfounded.   Elle told me that she's only interested in men who, in her words, is an 8 or better (looks-wise),  taller than her when she's wearing heels, of a certain complexion, ideally no beard, has advanced degrees, making over $100k/year, doesn't have kids, and is currently attending church every week or every other week.  But the big kicker that got me was that she insists that she's unwilling to date a man (like...go out on dates) who won't commit to waiting until marriage for sex. Yes, she's religious but she's not a virign and has had sex in all past relationships.    According to Elle, this is a conversation that should be had before even the first date, and if the guy isn't firmly agreeing, it's a no-go. When I challenged her thoughts and logic on this, she got increasingly upset.   I told her that I think she's asking for a very tall order, making dating harder than it should be. I'm not saying she should compromise on her religious values, but I am trying to tell her that she should be more open-minded about her criteria because she's looking for a one in a million guy, while also prematurely shutting down and shutting out some potentially great guys because of their income and/or height.    Elle is now furious at me and says I'm not being a supportive friend. She says that I don't understand her faith and am being something of a Debbie Downer. AITA?",

We've been arguing frequently due to misunderstandings. I asked her parents if I could fly up to see her for her birthday, and they paid for the tickets despite my offer to cover it myself. However, Sarah told me she planned to spend most of her time on the phone with her boyfriend and might kick me out of her room. This made me reconsider the trip, as I wanted to visit her, not just be a third wheel. After a misunderstanding, she clarified that she would call him during downtime and spend holidays with him, which seemed fair. We hung up, but then her boyfriend texted me (he already had my number) about Sarah having a bad day and said my uncertainty about visiting made it worse. I felt this was inappropriate and told him to mind his business. Sarah then told me I couldn't speak to him that way and that she had given him permission to text me the message.  I was shocked and explained that he crossed a boundary. She responded that her business was his, which made me feel disrespected. I had her parents cancel my tickets, but I expressed gratitude for their support. I felt uncomfortable visiting, especially with the potential for further arguments and disrespect for my boundaries. Sarah defended her boyfriend, saying he was just trying to help and that she really wanted me there for her birthday. She was upset that I won\u2019t be there, expressing that it hurt her deeply, especially since she had fought her dad for months to be able to visit me (though he ultimately said no). I reminded her that I had to remind her about my own birthday during a busy time when she was moving. She said it will take a long time for her to get over the hurt of me choosing not to visit.  I think I might be the asshole because at the end of the day it is her 18th birthday and I don\u2019t want her to hold this over my head.   I don\u2019t want to be in an environment where I might argue again, and I\u2019d rather focus on my own life and obligations. Given the situation, do you think I did anything wrong? AITA for canceling my trip to see my best friend for her 18th birthday? (Edit: they both met because I introduced them. He and I ran gaming channels and he messaged me to collaborate.

        "selftext": "I have a roommate who pays me about 90% of half the rent\u2014so if the total rent is $1,600, they contribute around $700. I cover the rest, along with water, gas, internet, and electricity, because I earn more than they do. When they first moved in, I felt sorry for them because they were leaving an abusive situation. It\u2019s been a little over a year since they moved into my guest room, and overall, it hasn\u2019t been too bad. However, when they moved in, I had some of my belongings in the closet\u2014primarily books. The room is fully furnished with my furniture, including a large bed that takes up a lot of space, a heavy bookshelf, and around 500 books stored in 5\u20136 boxes and two large bags. I always intended to go through them, pick out my favorites, and donate or sell the rest, but due to my ADHD and object impermanence, I kept pushing it off. In the long run, I envisioned turning the room into a closet/library after they moved out since I prefer having my clothes visible rather than stored away. Last year, I came home to find my bookshelf outside by the dumpsters. I immediately told my roommate to put it back in the room because they had no right to throw away my belongings. If they had asked, I would have found another place for it, but I was so frustrated that I insisted they return it to the room without offering an alternative solution. Fast forward to now: I recently hired someone to help clean my apartment when work gets too busy. They offered to organize my cabinets, which reminded me to finally sort through my books\u2014only to be told that my roommate had thrown them all away months ago. Over 500 books\u2014hardcover, paperback, large, small, books I had kept since middle school\u2014just gone. They never asked, never mentioned feeling uncomfortable with them in the closet, never gave me a chance to move them. They simply decided to discard decades of my history without my permission. I was so upset that I haven\u2019t spoken to them in over a week. It\u2019s not just about the books\u2014it\u2019s about the complete lack of respect for my things. My first instinct is to kick them out (yes, I understand the legal complexities of tenancy and eviction), but instead, I\u2019ve decided that I no longer want to cover the bulk of the bills. I\u2019ve drafted a document that evenly splits all household expenses, which will increase their contribution by at least $500. WIBTA if I taped it to their door? This isn\u2019t the arrangement we originally agreed upon when they moved in, but at this point, I feel that if they can blatantly disrespect my belongings, they no longer deserve my generosity. ",

For a few years we didn't get to see each other much because we went to college on opposite sides of the country, but I moved to her city last year so we really got to catch up with each other.  Hayley will be turning 25 in a week so we - along with some other friends - started planning her birthday party a while ago. She wanted to have a rather big party so that she could invite all of her friends groups, but we couldn't find anywhere to have it and she lives in a small apartment. I on the other hand have a house, it's not that big but it's big enough to host the party. So our friends started bringing it up and said that we could throw the party at my house.  I was fine with that. I did find it kinda weird that they were the one to bring it up, because I personally wouldn't suggest throwing a party in someone else's house unless they were the one to suggest it, but it didn't really matter. So I said yes, my only conditions were that the party didn't turn into chaos, that no one got too drunk, and that they helped me clean up the next day. Everyone was fine with that so we agreed on it.  Yesterday, Hayley sent me a text to tell me how many people would be there. That's when she asked me if I could get my cat out of the house for the night, because one of her friends from college is allergic. I told her that I didn't have anywhere else to leave him, but that I could make sure that he stayed upstairs while we were downstairs. I also told her that my cat is very shy and easily scared so there's no way he'd get close to her friend.  She then told me that I could just leave him with my parents and then go back to get him the next day. My parent's house is about an hour and a half drive and there's just no way I'd drive a total of 6 hours in one weekend. I told her that it really wasn't possible for me to leave him with my parents but that he would be locked upstairs and I'd deep clean the house to make sure there's no cat hair anywhere. I also told her that she should've told me earlier and I could've found another solution, but now the party is in less than a week.   She told me that I wasn't being helpful and that I was ruining her party, and she's been bitching about me to a lot of our mutual friends. I told her that I had no obligation to let her do the party at my house and I kindly accepted to do so, so the least she could do was to be grateful. She hasn't replied since. Most of our friends agree with me, but I also feel a bit guilty. I don't know if I'm in the wrong here and I don't know what else I can do.  ",

        "selftext": "My (23M) cousin (30M) and his GF (32F) recently had to move out of their place after his girlfriend lost her job. My cousin has been unemployed for quite some time due to his mental health, which is a sore subject for him (this will be relevant later). His GF has been job searching, but it\u2019s a long process and they need somewhere to stay in the meantime, so they\u2019ve been staying with me and my roommate (22M).\u00a0 I didn\u2019t love this arrangement in the first place since we have a two-bedroom apartment and I\u2019ve needed to move into my roommate\u2019s room to make space, but it\u2019s family and my roommate says he doesn\u2019t mind having me in his room for now (plus my aunt is paying us) so whatever.\u00a0 The problem is that my cousin and his GF have insisted on bringing their emotional support dog with them (not a service dog). It\u2019s technically fine in terms of our lease and I don\u2019t mind dogs in general so at first I said OK, but this thing has been a nightmare. It\u2019s loud, pees on our floors, and it chewed up one of our couch pillows. My cousin and his GF think this behavior is hysterical and endearing, but every time my roommate and I tried to bring up that we\u2019d rather they find somewhere else for their dog, they go on and on about how they can\u2019t possibly part with their \u201cfur baby\u201d and just will not hear it. This all kind of culminated last night because my roommate had an important presentation this morning so he tried to go to bed early last night, but the dog would not stop barking. My cousin and his GF were all like \u201cawww she wants to play\u201d but my roommate and I were pretty annoyed. I told my cousin that this arrangement was not working and that he needed to find somewhere else to put the dog. He told me again that it\u2019s their \u201cfur baby\u201d, and his GF started getting really upset and telling me we were making the dog feel unwelcome and it was like asking them to part with their child. I told them that the dog is not a baby and that they need to take responsibility for it or find somewhere else for the three of them to stay. He reminded me that he needs the dog for emotional support and that his GF is trying to find a job and they have nowhere to go until then. Partially out of anger, I told him that his emotional support needs weren\u2019t my problem and that maybe he should try getting a job too. I know he\u2019s had a rough time with his mental health and how that impacts employment so I think those two statements put together cut a little deeper than I intended, and he hasn\u2019t been talking to me today and his girlfriend called me an ableist for what I said. My aunt texted me this morning that my cousin and his GF plan on moving out this weekend with their dog and that I was way too harsh with him. I do understand why the comment had that effect on them and I feel bad for that, but it finally got the dog out of our place after we\u2019ve been trying the gentler approach so I don\u2019t really know what else I could\u2019ve done.

The entire time we\u2019ve been living together I\u2019m the one who has always done laundry. When the basket gets full I take it to the laundry room and wash everything that\u2019s in it. For the past several months my husband has started leaving his dirty clothes mostly in a pile in the floor in the bedroom instead of putting them in the basket.

        "selftext": "Some background: I (29F) used to know Tom (30M) years ago. We were acquaintances as teenagers, and though we briefly dated at 16, it wasn\u2019t serious, and we stayed on neutral terms whenever we ran into each other. A few years later, when we were in our early twenties, I bumped into him at a nightclub, and he introduced me to his then-girlfriend, Alex. From the moment we met, Alex was noticeably cold toward me she barely spoke, made passive-aggressive comments about my appearance, and created an uncomfortable tension. Sensing the awkwardness, I made my exit. Tom later messaged me to apologize for how she acted, but I brushed it off. I didn\u2019t think much of it, as we weren\u2019t close anyway. Since then, I\u2019ve occasionally run into them at different social events, and Alex\u2019s attitude toward me has never changed. She has made snide remarks in passing, whispered about me to others while I was nearby, and has generally gone out of her way to be hostile anytime we\u2019re in the same space. I\u2019ve always ignored it because, as far as I was concerned, whatever problem she had with me wasn\u2019t my issue. Now to last weekend, I was out with some friends when I saw Alex and Tom at the same venue. Tom came over to say hello and make small talk, and almost immediately, Alex stormed over. Without even greeting me, she shoved her ring in my face and made a pointed comment about how I \u201cdefinitely couldn\u2019t have him now.\u201d I laughed and told her I never wanted him in the first place, but I was happy for them. That only made things worse. She started raising her voice, accusing me of trying to get attention for years, making assumptions about me, and throwing out personal insults. When she finally finished, I asked if she was done and told her that I had never done any of the things she was accusing me of. I also made it clear that I didn\u2019t care about her or Tom and, most importantly, that she needed to stop making her personal insecurities my problem. She looked like she was about to respond, so I added that she also needed to stop being jealous of me because there was no reason for it. At that point, she excused herself and left the room, with Tom following after her. Before he left, he told me I didn\u2019t need to say all that. My friends thought my response was blunt but justified, while some mutuals later told me I was too harsh and should have been more understanding because she\u2019s obviously insecure. Now, I\u2019m wondering was I too harsh?",

        "selftext": "I (26F) lost my mother to cancer when I was 8 and have always had an absent father. I only found out who he was when I was 13 and even then he did not want custody of me forcing me to stay in the foster system until I was 18. Over my whole life I have had about 5 conversations with him give or take- he is like a stranger to me. He appears once in a blue moon to ask for money or something along those lines. It doesn't really bother me anymore, I've just learnt to accept it now but i don't like talking about it so to avoid that conversation with people i usually just say both my parents are dead. This leads me to a year and a half ago when I had just started dating my boyfriend (25M) and like usual I had just told him my parents were dead but the other day my dad showed up at my door (I still don't know how he knows where I live) and asked for 100 dollars except my boyfriend was there and he obviously found out my dad was not dead. This lead to a long conversation with him that night where I explained the whole situation. He said this was a breach of trust between us since I lied about my dad and that he needed some space to rethink our relationship but he doesn't think he will leave me. I feel so shitty and that I should have told him earlier but I am going to be honest I just didn't think. So AITA? UPDATE: my boyfriend texted me 5 mins ago asking to talk so we are going to have a full in depth conversation tomorrow after work and I'll update again then :)   UPDATE 2 (last update): Before I get to the update I would like clear things up. 1. I have only given money to my dad once when I was still desperate for his love and acceptance but he did not get any money this time. 2. Despite his confusion my bf stepped in to defend me and get my dad to leave and it was only after my dad left he asked me about it Now onto the update. My boyfriend told me that all the sudden information along with the knowledge I hadn't told him the truth was very overwhelming and he just needed some space to not say the wrong thing. He also said that he got why I lied initially and he wasn't mad that I lied more hurt that I felt like I couldn't tell him about it. He also mentioned that he couldn't be there for me if he didn't know what was going on. The conversation ended in tears and it is the most vulnerable I have been in front of someone. He was very understanding and we have decided to draw a line in the sand and 'start again' if that makes sense. I have also looked into therapy for my childhood trauma and all in all I am using this as an opportunity to better myself and heal fully. Thank you for all your kind comments :)",

He requested I send links to things I want because he isn\u2019t creative to know what I want. He likes when I just tell him things \u2014 clear and direct. If I do not ask for a gift (birthday, Christmas, etc) I\u2019m not receiving anything. This happened in 2024. He asked me to pick an engagement ring out because he just couldn\u2019t decide. He TOLD ME HE WOULD BUY THIS NECKLACE 2 years ago, and I\u2019ve waited this long. I sent links, photos, we have walked through pandora together to see what it is I wanted. We are in couples counseling to work on communication and putting in effort since he struggles with it. He\u2019s well aware he struggles with this. So for everyone telling me to just buy it myself, it defeats the purpose of him saying he will buy it and requesting links to what I want. I thought about buying it myself for quite a while, but I have waited patiently for him to put in the effort and keep his word.  My husband (28m) and I(29f) have been married nearly a year now, and our anniversary is coming up soon. Ever since we have dated I have expressed how I\u2019d love a dainty initial necklace with the letter d to wear daily. Corny? Sure, but I love it. Anyway\u2026after a year of not receiving the necklace I started showing him pictures on Etsy of the ones I love (small gold plates with a lower case d in typewriter font \u2014 all of them were this font and style) we even walked through pandora to the custom engraved section and how he could write it and that would be very precious and meaningful to me. He thought it was neat and this whole time I thought he was absorbing what I was saying and listening. All he absorbed was the word \u2018dainty\u2019 apparently. This comes down to this morning. He expressed he was bored at work (night shift and he works for weeks at a time 1000 miles away from me). And this morning he bought a small (in size) but very thick bulky d necklace is some kind of frilly cursive that doesn\u2019t even look like a d. We share an email and I had literally opened it to check our daily emails like I do daily and it refreshed and there was the purchase. I texted him and expressed that it\u2019s absolutely nothing like I\u2019ve expressed for years. I\u2019ve waited this long for a necklace \u2014 I want to actually like and wear it. He told me I wanted dainty and that it is dainty, and I tried to explain dainty and delicate doesn\u2019t just mean in size and he googled it sent me the definition of dainty. I told him it was absolutely nothing like I\u2019ve shown him for years and to just cancel the order. Naturally this makes me ungrateful in his eyes. AITAH?",

I have a friend, who i will call Lara (25F), and she unfortunately has a problem with punctuality. She has a tendency to be at least 20 minutes late, but there have been times where she has even been 40-50 minutes late. This is not due to traffic, but because she starts getting ready late and goes out of the house 5 minutes before our agreed time if not later. I have told her multiple times that i do not appreciate it. For example, I have sat alone in a restaurant for half an hour to make sure we did not lose the reservation. And this is just one of the situations which leave me frustrated. Other than that, she is a good friend and we have Lots of fun hangouts together. Well yesterday evening it was very cold and windy outside (1 Degree Celsius), and we had planned to meet in the city centre and go for food and drinks afterwards. I had texted her to remind her to leave her house on time. It takes me around 40 minutes to get there, so I cannot spontaneously just exit the house and be there, I have to plan my time. When I arrived, I was right on time (as opposed 10 minutes earlier, because I know it\u2019s useless with her anyway) and I started waiting. After around 30 minutes I lost my patience, texted her to forget it and just left. I was cold and in a bad mood, especially because she told me that she would be there \u201cright away\u201d. She apparently was there 15 minutes later and called me upset, that I don\u2019t understand how she is and I am being a bad friend. That I should not make plans if I am not okay with waiting, which I did not agree with. Still, I have never left like this before and I feel guilty for leaving her like this. Was I the asshole? Little update I have left in the comments: She called me a few hours ago, and we talked for a bit. She apologized for insulting me, ignoring my messages AND for being late this time. She sounded like she really regretted it, but I was a bit bitter about the fact that I had to take it this far for her to wake up. I did not talk about meeting up again, as I just want to let it sink in a bit more and not just two days. And I think afterwards I will use one of the suggestions that said to meet in a cafe and give her a range, such as \u201cI will be here from 15 to 15:30\u201d, and see how that works out. I truly don\u2019t want to lose her and I was sorry to hear her like this, but she hurt me first and she needs to understand that too",

However, I said I will not be doing so, and will be sticking with my choice, which upset her.

Because of this, I'm already starting to prepare what I'm going to take with me when I move out, even though that likely won't be a while because I also plan to move in with 2 of my close friends and we need to arrange where we'll be living first. Some things I definitely want to take with me when I move out are my gaming consoles. An Xbox 360, an Xbox One S, and a Playstation 4, all of which were given to me as birthday or Christmas presents. Because they were given to me specifically, I think it's only fair that I get to take them with me when I move out. However my mother doesn't seem to think so. My mother believes that I can only take one console with me, the ps4, and leave both Xbox consoles with them. Her justification for it is that she and my sister (5) won't have anything if I take all the consoles. She also said that it's a thing that when you get a new console the older one is passed down as a family console. I thought this was completely stupid, because they were given to me as gifts, and now she just expects me to leave 2 of them behind just so they can actually have gaming consoles. I'd like to add that I've spent my own gift money on both the ps4 AND xbox one to buy games and other things for certain games, but she's also bought quite a bit of stuff on the xbox too (DLCs for the Sims 4 mainly). That's another reason why she doesn't want me to take the xbox one, because she spent money on it herself. I feel like she's trying to just guilt trip me, but I need to know if I'm really in the wrong for wanting to take things that were given to me with me when I move out. WIBTA? Edit to add: I feel like I should have pointed this out originally, but my mother is acting like there would be absolutely no at home gaming consoles left in the house when that isn't the case at all. We have an old gamecube that has quite a few games too, all it needs is to get new cords to plug in to the tv and then the power button needs to be fixed because it's stuck pressed down Edit 2: since a lot of people are bringing up visiting my family when I move out and leaving one console there for them and switching the consoles out, that wouldn't be an option, if I leave a console it's gone for good. My parents haven't been the best people my whole life for more serious issues I didn't feel the need to go into before, but these things are making me decide to go no contact with my father and limited contact with my mother.",

A few months in, I got pregnant and decided to go home to give birth, but I kept paying rent since I planned to return. Before leaving, I moved my TV into my locked bedroom. She could still use everything else, but I did this because she gets careless when high or drunk\u2014leaving keys in the door, passing out randomly, etc. I didn\u2019t want my things stolen or damaged. About a month later, she mentioned her brother was staying over. He was cool, so I had no issue with it. I was actually thinking of offering him my room since he was only staying a few days. But on FaceTime, I noticed a big TV in the background. I asked, \u201cOh, you got a new TV?\u201d She said no. \u201cDid he bring one?\u201d Again, no. Then she pans the camera and says, \u201cOh, we took yours out of your room. It just goes with the aesthetics.\u201d I said, \u201cBut my room was locked?\u201d She just shrugged. \u201cI used a knife to get in.\u201d Like it was nothing. I blacked out, cussed her out, and ended the call. Then I asked my maintenance friend from the complex to check things out. It wasn\u2019t just my TV\u2014my room was messy, my locked bathroom had been broken into, and both she and her brother had been wearing my clothes. I was livid. I called her, and she finally answered when I threatened legal action. She said it was selfish of me to put the TV in my room because they had nothing to use. Mind you, we both had TVs in our bedrooms. At that point, I was done. I had my sister and a friend clear out my stuff while she was at work. Anything we bought together, I sent her half the money for\u2014including the dining table, even though I was being petty when I took it. I also disconnected the electricity (didn\u2019t want her running up a spite bill) and stopped paying rent. Unfortunately, I lost the baby and returned earlier than planned. When I got back, the apartment was trashed. She had moved out, stopped paying rent, and now the delinquency is on both our credit reports. Years of friendship gone, just like that. No apology, no accountability, no nothing. Just one FaceTime call, and that was it. AITA for handling it this way? Should I have kept paying rent since moving in together was my idea?",

        "selftext": "Hello Reddit universe, first post. Let\u2019s get into it. I (38 M) have a girlfriend (Bonni) with a 13-year old son, and they live in a house with her sister. Her sister has a boyfriend, Dude, who comes around but doesn\u2019t live there. He normally carries a pistol on him. I haven\u2019t known him long, but he seems like a nice guy and we typically get along. He has seemed responsible with his guns which I appreciate, especially with kids around. I\u2019ve been around firearms my whole life and take gun safety seriously. The other night Bonni, her son and I get home to an empty house and as we are getting ready for dinner, she notices a small fanny pack on the kitchen table that doesn\u2019t belong to us. She moves it, notices it\u2019s heavy and asks me if I think there\u2019s gun in there. She handed it over and it was pretty obvious that\u2019s what it was. Knowing he likes to practice concealed carry, I wondered if it was loaded and ready to fire. So I unzipped the bag and took a look. I wanted to make sure Dude at least left it in relatively \u2018safe\u2019 condition. Thought about just moving it, but I really wanted to know the exact situation that was left unattended on the kitchen table.  What I found was a loaded Glock 9mm with a round in the chamber and ready to fire. It was holstered, but being a Glock, there is no traditional \u2018safety\u2019 on the gun and anyone could just pull it out and fire off a round. So I dropped out the magazine, cleared the round from the chamber, and put it back in his bag in a much safer condition than I found it.  I then text him telling him I did that, and let\u2019s make sure that doesn\u2019t happen again. He then calls me NOT to apologize, but to tell me how pissed off he is that I violated his privacy. A day later thought he\u2019d come to his senses but I hear that he is still livid and that I should apologize, although I have not heard a single bit of remorse or apology from him to Bonni for leaving an unsecured, loaded gun sitting out for anyone to get at.  In my mind, the safety of everyone in the house, especially the kid, is priority #1 and should far outweigh anyone\u2019s feelings of privacy violation. No, I wouldn\u2019t be stoked if someone in general decided to open and look in my bag. But if I were to make the huge mistake of leaving a loaded gun in a common area where a kid lives, if anything I\u2019d hope that someone responsible would do the same thing I did, make the situation safer, and help prevent any chance of my mistake becoming something much worse.  AITA for prioritizing this safety concern over Dude\u2019s privacy? UPDATE: To be fair I missed a detail - turns out he had given the gun to Bonni\u2019s sister to take with them to lock up, and she left it on the table on accident. ",

        "selftext": "I'm gonna try to keep this as short and sweet as I can because I just need to know if I really fucked up. For backstory, I, (21F) have a best friend Ali (21F), and we've been best friends since ninth grade. We're complete open books with each other, and we've, until now, never judged. I always wanted her to feel safe to talk to me about anything, and I hoped she felt the same about me. We both go to the same uni and room together. So, around eight almost nine months ago (we had been friends since I started uni), I got together with my girlfriend Freddie (22F), and she's been my first love. It's been so incredible being with her, she is such an angel that just gets me on every single level. Biiiig oversharing time, but losing my virginity has always been something that really scared me, in the sense of trusting someone with my body like that. No trauma or anything, just scared, but I finally got there with Freddie a few nights ago. She was so loving and after we were done I just cried out happy tears. I was so just ecstatic that I got to do that with someone I love so much, and Freddie just hugged me tight and was so kind about it. I told Ali about this the day after and since them she keeps making jokes about me being a big big cry baby and will just mock cry at me randomly when we see each other. I just rolled my eyes at her and tried to just bear it, because no way was I letting her ruin that experience for me. Last night we were at a party together and she absolutely crossed the line. First, she was just making wah wah noises at me, but then she made a gross joke about Freddie having a 'thing' for crying. I just yelled at her to shut up because I'm so fucking sick of it. It's just not funny. She looked all shocked and I just called Freddie and asked her to pick me up. I've been at her apartment off-campus since, and Ali and some of our friends that witnessed it are getting upset with me and telling me to stop being so sensitive. I haven't answered any texts yet, and Freddie's telling me I did nothing wrong with removing myself from the situation, but I'm still so conflicted. \u2014\u2014\u2014UPDATE Um so the AITA mods wouldnt let me post the update as a stand alone so I\u2019m just gonna paste it here LMFAO.  I'm not sure if anyone cares for an update but I'm gonna post one anyways LOL! I got much good advice on my last post, but against what multiple people were saying, I decided to talk to Ali. We've been friends for long, and frankly, this is real life. I'm not gonna cut her off without even speaking to her first. Also, shoutout to the person who said crying after sex was a sapphic rite of passion, my girlfriend thinks you're hilarious!! Anyways, I messaged Ali and told her to meet me at the late night coffee shop we frequent, and she answered yes. I asked Freddie if she could wait outside in the car for me in case things go south, which she said of course to. I was nervous, and Ali was already there by the time we pulled up. She looked nervous too, but also somehow pissed off?? I sat down and she immediately asked me what the hell was wrong with me completely icing her out like that. I kept myself calm then, despite my rising anger. I told her how insane it was that she thinks she's the victim here, she taunted me for days over something she knew what really important to me, and then at the crest of it all she made a downright disgusting joke about my girlfriend. I told her if she didn't explain exactly why she thought any of that was remotely okay, there was zero chance of us ever being friends again. She shut her mouth fast, and looked kind of conflicted before she just blurted out some actual Wattpad shit I'd read when I was thirteen, I'm just pissed off because it should've been me making you cry like that. Uhhhh?? She pretty much just word vomited about how jealous she is of Freddie and that she's liked me since grade 12, when I got hot (UH?). Safe to say, I don't think I've ever been angrier. I can't remember well what I said, I was just\u00a0*so angry.*\u00a0I told her something about how bizarre she sounds, that I can't believe she would never tell me and just be a total bitch. I got too loud when telling her I was switching dorms, when an employee asked me to leave. Ali tried to follow me out but I told her to fuck off and drove away with a very concerned Freddie. I blocked her on our way home. I told our friends that witnessed the party, and also the ones who weren't there (just in case they were told something) the real story, and they all apologized to me. To be fair, they were all pretty wasted at the time of the incident, and probably didn't really realize exactly what was going on. They agreed to cut Ali out of the group, and that's just where we are now. I'm keeping the ones who berated me at arms length, just for my own sanity right now. Ali's tried to approach me a few times, but it's when I've been with people who know, so they helped me get rid of her quick. I'm still very hurt and weirded out, but I luckily have Freddie and good friends to keep me upright. Anyways, thank you so much for all the support on the last post, and have a good night!",

        "selftext": "My (35F) little sister (31F) gave birth to her second child late Dec '24. She asked me to be her 2nd birth partner to support her and her husband and I was stoked to agree. Mom thought it was great too. Some background on my parents (65F, 71M). Mom loves to play the victim. We used to be close, but I don't like playing her therapist anymore. My dad was a workaholic with zero emotional regulation and quick to anger.  Jump to Dec. It was the most amazing and emotional experience to help my sis and she has a calm, natural birth. They made baby's middle name my first name, total honour. I tried leaving to avoid overstaying but my sister wanted me to stay at the hospital overnight to help her while her husband went back home to their toddler, so I did. It was super special caring for her.  In the lead up my sis told my parents she's not sure if she wants them visiting the hospital or when they first get home. She also sets the don't come if you're sick and no kissing baby rule. They're miffed. Next morning Mom messages me and invites her and dad to have a coffee at the hospital. I say I'll come to our family home but she says no because they are in the middle of packing to move to their property 3 hrs away. When we meet, my dad is coughing/sick and he goes so we are going up to meet the baby now? I say no that's not the plan and you can't meet baby if you are sick. Dad starts yelling in the middle of the hospital cafe saying yes he can because baby already has an immunity from my sister and heaps of babies are born in disgusting conditions around the world. He then accuses me of subterfuge for being at the birth. He won't stop yelling and demanding to go up to the ward. I tell him he doesn't have my sister's permission and she needs to know he's unwell. My Mom is all I told you not to say anything. Dad keeps escalating. I tell dad I'd rather he be NC with me than I go against my sister's boundaries when she's so vulnerable after birth. He carries on about my conniving subterfuge and manipulation I think for not saying I was at the birth. I then told Dad that my sister asked me 6 months ago, sis had told mom multiple times since and sis told Mom yesterday I was on my way. Dad looked confused and mum says \u201cI must have forgot\u201d. I went back to the ward without them, warned my sister, said goodbye and made a hasty exit to drive back home, crying the whole way. My sis ended up letting my parents come into the ward though Dad wasn't allowed near the baby...I then find out they drove back to their property the next day. so it was zero about supporting my sister and her husband. I haven't spoken to my parents since. AITA? tldr: I was my sister's birth partner, my boomer parents lost their shit and accused me of deceit and subterfuge.",

        "selftext": "I (28M) am from the Philippines and have been in a bit of a financial bind recently, trying to manage our family\u2019s finances as best I can. My wife (28F) and I have two kids\u2014a 7-year-old son and a daughter who will be turning 1 soon. I\u2019m the only one working, and I earn about $850 a month. After paying bills and groceries, money is tight. In January, I received a total of $828. I paid $234 in bills in total and gave my wife $144 to budget for the first two weeks. The rest, I kept as savings for our daughter\u2019s birthday, with the plan to add more in the upcoming paychecks. Unfortunately, we didn\u2019t manage the $144 well, and by the next paycheck, we were down to $54 in savings. On January 10th, I noticed my wife only had $28 left, and by the 12th, she was down to just $5. When I asked how that happened, she got upset but said not to worry because it was all spent on us. At this point, I had to dip into the savings I set aside for our daughter\u2019s birthday to cover expenses. Fast forward to later in the month, and I decided to take control of the finances for the next paycheck. I told my wife I would be handling the money for the next two paychecks so I could keep track of everything. I told her she could still take money from my wallet, but she would have to let me know how much and what it was for. She got upset, saying I don\u2019t trust her and that I was being selfish. A few days later, I discovered she was planning to pawn her necklace to help her sister pay off her debt. I tried to open up a conversation by asking about her sister\u2019s situation, hoping she would tell me about the necklace. Eventually, I directly asked if she planned to pawn it to help her sister, and she admitted it. I told her I was against it because we were already in a tough spot financially, and we needed the necklace for our daughter\u2019s birthday. That led to an argument, and she said she\u2019d rather not celebrate our daughter\u2019s birthday than not help her sister. I tried to explain that it\u2019s okay to help others, but it can\u2019t come at the cost of our own financial stability. She became really angry and said she wasn\u2019t willing to understand or give me a chance to explain. She accused me of not trusting her and being selfish, and we\u2019ve been at odds since then. On top of all this, she\u2019s been acting childish in this situation. She insists on not touching our shared money, which we are supposed to spend as part of our budget, but then complains about having it difficult. When I called her out on this behavior, I made it very clear that she needs to grow up and be more responsible. I\u2019ve been feeling hurt because I feel like I made my plans clear and that I\u2019m just trying to keep us financially stable. AITA for being strict about managing our money and not allowing my wife to pawn the necklace to help her sister?",

        "selftext": "Throwaway account. My house is for sale. It\u2019s being sold due to my marriage unexpectedly breaking down after I found out my husband - \u201cAdam\u201d - had been having a year long affair and when caught, moved out. Adam has been a real POS in the aftermath - very justified, hostile and mean. It\u2019s been awful. Did I mention we have two kids? They are 3 and 1. I was pregnant the entire time he cheated.  I digress. The house is in my name and is operating under a private sale. And right now there are a few parties competing for it. I\u2019ll sell it in the next 72 hours to clear our debts.  Here\u2019s the kicker: his best friend (his best man) and his wife want to buy it. But they didn\u2019t tell me. They had the estate agent tell me. These are people who i have called friends for a long time, but when this affair broke out, they were sympathetic but then vanished in the last 6 months. Ghosted me and the children - would be cordial when I ran into them, and I would be too - but other than that, no support. Now they are in a tight race with others to buy it and I find the entire scenario weird and deeply awkward. Why wouldn\u2019t they just call and tell me beforehand?! Why get the agent to tell me? There\u2019s better ways to go about this. They aren\u2019t bad people. Just awkward.This is so shitty and emotional. But on a logical front, sell this damn house. So the offers are coming in and they\u2019re getting pretty tight money wise and similar in terms. I told the agent that someone needs to differentiate and make a bigger offer so that I\u2019m not splitting hairs. I am reluctant to sell to them as it\u2019s so weird and awkward. I feel like they\u2019re dancing on the grave a bit. I really want these other bidders I don\u2019t know to get it because I don\u2019t want to make a decision. I don\u2019t really see these friends anymore - my husband does - and I can see it for what it is, despite it being really disappointing by them.  Would I be the asshole if I went with these other people if the offers and terms were practically the same?  Edit: edited for paragraph breaks! Update (if interested) For those who commented or upvoted my post, thank you for your supportive comments and advice. I got a high offer, it's close to $3m, and it's from my ex's best friend and his wife. Fine. Obviously awkward and uncomfortable as hell, but fine, that's an incredible price and more money than I dreamed of this house fetching. It clears our mortgages and there's cash leftover. The other buyers walk. I tell the agent: yes - sold. Let me know when the signed contracts come through.But... I don't get a contract. The agent and I are on the phone all the time. He is communicating with me around the clock and it is reassuring. But I tell him I have a bad feeling, why don't I have a contract? He tells me that it's all in hand, they are finalising some smaller details, it will come through shortly.And that's when the calls and messages start. The husband - let's call him Paul - is trying to reach out. He wants to speak. I avoid his calls and tell him I'm busy with the kids, any q's regarding the sale direct through to agent, l'm ready to sign. Paul says, no concerns commercially, we want to check if you're ok, call me. My agent says - you're right to have a bad feeling, they won't sign until you say you are ok with this sale. He says in 20 years of real estate he's never heard of such a thing. I tell the agent this is emotional blackmall. He says he has tried everything to convince them but they insist on me saying it's ok. I feel shaky and sick. It's at this point that I very much can see that they are having a crisis of conscience. They have suddenly realised the optics aren't  great around this. They know that this will invite a lot of judgement... and when it comes they need to have some good 'spin' on it. I can picture them saying, how did she [me] feel about it? She was fine - she was just so relieved that another family was moving into it. Naturally we checked on her!. I find all of this so gross. So l'm over a barrel. I'm about to lose $3m if I don't tell them what they want to hear. It's too risky to call their bluff. I can't believe they let it get to this point and then throw this emotional condition into a commercial transaction. So I tell them what they want to hear only via text - so l don't have to speak to them. This forced message apologises that I have been avoiding their calls as l've been overwhelmed with selling the house and I'm cool with it. I feel... grubby. I don't lie, I really don't. But this is for my children. I send the text and within an hour my inbox gets the contract. I sign it. I receive a text from each of them thanking me and that my children and I are important to them and they would never have signed unless I was ok with it. Now I am waiting for the cooling off period to pass. Settlement isn't for 4 months. If they bail between now and then, and of course they could, they would forfeit their $500k deposit. ",

        "selftext": "Okay so I (29M) started college when I was 17. Because of my family\u2019s income and general status I was not granted much financial aid for college. Because I have 2 younger siblings, and my parents had other financial responsibilities, my parents could not afford to pay out-of-pocket for my undergrad and I was not granted nearly enough in personal loans. The school my parents and I agreed on is a private university, and tuition was high.  Because of the cost of the college, personal loans were taken out in my name, and my parents took out Parent Plus Loans in their name. Now I work full-time and my loans are on an income-driven repayment plan. I am easily able to manage my monthly payments on those (the ones in my name). However, my issue is that my parents are demanding monthly payments for the ParentPlus Loans taken out in their names. Their stance is that the loans were taken out for me and my education, so I am responsible for repaying them. The ParentPlus Loans cannot be transferred to me, and the payments are literally half of my income each month, because the lowest payment option is based on THEIR income, which is significantly higher than mine.  I have been paying them monthly for a year, and this has forced me to live paycheck to paycheck, unable to save for a car or house. I can\u2019t start a family, and I can\u2019t progress financially in any way due to immediately having to spend every dollar I earn on those payments plus rent/bills/insurance/groceries/therapy/etc\u2026 The ParentPlus Loans are currently in forbearance (since October) until April. This past week I told my parents I will not be resuming payments on them due to 1) Its not my loan. 2) We (Americans) are about to get hit with a recession/depression. 3) I cannot advance in any way making these payments. My mother has responded saying that\u2019s not an option because their retirement and/or credit will be ruined by this choice, and that I will owe them the money. AITA for wanting to stop these payments?  TLDR; My parents took out a loan for me to go to college, but the loan was in their name. They now expect me to pay them back for it, but I can\u2019t afford it. AITA for discontinuing payments so I can afford to live somewhat comfortably?  Edit 1 (More Info): There was no clear communication about repayment discussed when the loans were taken out. My mom took control of financial planning of my college, and I was very passive in the process, unaware any loans were taken out in their name until payments started being due. If they were my personal loans, they would be payed based on my current income. Edit 2 (More Info): My parents didn\u2019t force me to go to a specific school, but also I wasn\u2019t really provided choices. When I graduated high school, the discussion was basically \u201cSo you\u2019re going here, right? Because that\u2019s the best option.\u201d and there wasn\u2019t more debate or discussion on it. I liked the school. My parents liked the school. I didn\u2019t really take ownership of that decision or fight it because my mom took charge of college stuff for me.  Edit 3 (More Info): My parents knew what types of loans were being taken out. They both work in banking/finance, and know how money/loans work. And again, my mom took full accountability/ownership for the financial planning of my college.  Edit 4 (Wording): I have no stopped the payments yet. Adjusted wording to reflect that I want to stop making them. The loans are currently in forbearance. There was no sudden stop of payments to my parents. Edit 5 (Idek): People seem to think I\u2019m set on my opinion. I\u2019m here to listen, learn, and grow. I\u2019m not trying to screw over my parents, and I\u2019m not accusing my parents of being malicious. I\u2019m trying to come up with solutions that my parents and I can use as a team to combat this. And I want to hear all perspectives on the situation. Attacking me by saying I hate my parents or vice versa is simply not true, and not helpful. Edit 6: Because people are still attacking me for being \u201cselfish\u201d or \u201chating my parents\u201d I need to be VERY clear that I am here, again, to listen and learn. You are able to communicate your perspectives respectfully. I don\u2019t hate my parents, nor do they hate me. I\u2019m not set on any plan other than working as a team with my parents to combat this. No one is cutting anyone off unless this escalates wildly and unexpectedly. Yall need to chill on the personal attacks. I can be in the wrong about something without being villainized. If I\u2019m in the wrong, just point it out and explain why. No need to attack me beyond that. Final Edit: Leaning ESH on my own post. Thanks to everyone who has been kind and given me insight, advice, support, and reassurance. My mom and I are working towards coming up with a plan so neither me nor my parents will be screwed over by this. People who kindly and respectfully disagreed with me, you are appreciated. This issue is no longer Me vs My Parents. It\u2019s now Me & My Parents vs The Problem. Thanks all except those menaces who for some reason think I should hate my parents or vice versa. \u2665\ufe0f\ud83d\udd7a\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udd25 ",

Now, she\u2019s aware that we\u2019ve included other people in our meals a couple of times because they\u2019re mutual friends. However a few days ago she made a comment how we NEVER do meals with her anymore. I calmly asked her what she meant by that and listed all the meals we\u2019ve included her in on then pointed out to her that I actually CAN say that she has never made a single meal for us in years so I don\u2019t understand why she\u2019d say that.

He comes over every weekend so my mom and I can care for the baby on Sunday and Monday nights. They leave for work at 3:00 a.m. and leave the baby with me until my mom gets home at 8:00 a.m. Then my mom takes over until they get back from work at 2:00 p.m. My mom works 12-hour night shifts. I do this once or twice a week, depending on my mom's schedule. Mind you, I did not sign up for this. They pretty much said, She's not doing anything anyway, so she can take care of the baby while my mom gets home. I'm currently not working, hence why I'm home and living off savings. I also have had health issues since November. I will be having surgery soon. This is another issue. I clearly told my mom that I did not want people coming in and out of our house because if I get sick, my surgery will be canceled. She does not care, and my brother and his girlfriend were sick last week, coughing and sneezing all over the house. Now, this weekend, the baby has started to get sick. I just texted them that one of them will have to call off work to take care of the baby because what if she gets worse? I know for a fact that they are still going to leave her and my brother is going to get pissed and start with the name calling.  You're a selfish *****, she's your niece. That's the reason things happen to you because you're a ***** and hypochondriac. You're weak minded.When I wanted to go to the ER for my pelvic pain nobody wanted to take me. I had to call my bf.

We were close, and I'm the godmother to her kids (f9 & f8). For years, I babysat often, sometimes for days or weekends while I was homeless and struggling with mental health. This continued for years. About three years ago, I met my now-wife (f29) and got a job I love. Initially, my sister was happy for me, but soon began complaining I wasn't around as much. I explained that while I loved her and the kids, I had to focus on my happiness. I still saw the kids lots, just not as often. After my wife and I married, things worsened. My sister started accusing me of being abused by my wife because I couldn\u2019t do everything for her anymore. She kept insisting that her kids and her should always come before my wife. She would demand things from us late at night, like chocolate or coffee, even when we were busy. When we didn't drop everything, she\u2019d get upset. Things escalated when she started telling us her husband was abusing her, but then told us not to tell anyone. She also shared inappropriate family gossip, which was triggering for me given my own childhood trauma. Last July, I was hospitalized for a serious illness. During this time, my sister repeatedly accused my wife of being abusive and criticized us for not spending enough time with her kids, even though I was in the hospital. She even said my wife was selfish for not picking up my sister's kids while I was sick. In November, my sister told my wife she wasn't welcome at family events and tried to plan a vacation without her. I tried to talk to her about it, but she mocked my concerns, laughed and dismissed my feelings, saying I was just letting my wife abuse me.I finally lost it, mentioning how unfair it was for my wife to be treated this way, especially when she behaved the way she did, including supporting her supposed abuser. My sister then texted that she wanted nothing to do with me and I was no longer welcome around her kids. This is where I might be the AH, I phoned our eldest sister, distraught. I told her EVERYTHING. Which of course my sister denied.  Afterward, her husband messaged the family group, calling me and my wife vile and accusing us of making up lies about his wife. They then removed us. They also took our holiday money (nearly $1000) and have been bad-mouthing us ever since. So, AITAH for blowing up at her? ",

        "selftext": "Throwaway. My ex-boyfriend and I had been dating for six years and living together for 3. l've been unhappy in our relationship for the past few months and finally decided it was time to break up with him. I broke up with him last week, and it's been extremely painful ever since. There have been a lot of tears and conversations, and trying to navigate moving out on top of everything has been hell. For context, I love my ex very much, but I felt breaking up was my only choice if I wanted to be happy as things were not getting better. On to the story! One of my friends had a bridal shower this weekend, and I could not be more excited for her. My ex-boyfriend and I have been good friends with this person and their fianc\u00e9 \u2014 we have even gone on vacations together. My friend is aware of my break-up and has seen first hand how much I have agonized over this decision. When I arrived at her bridal shower yesterday and started greeting other guests, I quickly realized that somehow everyone in the room already knew about my breakup. Throughout the night, I was approached by multiple people, even ones I barely know, who offered their condolences, told me they were proud of me, asked how my apartment search was going, and prompted me for details about my breakup and impending move. The MOH even pushed for details multiple times in front of the bride\u2019s family, even though I was very clearly trying to navigate away from the subject. The whole night felt like one of those scenes in high school when you walk into a room and notice people looking at you as if they've just been whispering about you. I played it off as best I could and tried to change the subject whenever possible. Apart from that, I would say the evening went fine and everyone had a lovely time celebrating the bride. However, since getting home yesterday, I can't help but feel really betrayed. It feels like my friend used my painful breakup as gossip and shared it with a lot of people who shouldn't know my personal business, especially since I'm not close with them in any way. Both my ex and I are real people with real feelings and our pain shouldn\u2019t be used as party gossip. I've also started receiving texts from people who attended the party, informing me that they've heard what happened and asking how I'm doing. While I understand their intentions are positive, this feels very invasive. These are her friends, not mine. I would have understood her sharing this with her partner or even a close mutual friend of ours, but this was much bigger than that. I texted her today and told her I could no longer be her bridesmaid or friend. Both her and the MOH think I overreacted. Now I\u2019m second guessing my decision and worried I was too rash \u2014 I just simply can\u2019t imagine treating a friend this way when they feel so vulnerable. Am I the asshole?",

Months go by and my friend is planning this wedding, she tells me a week ago that they have decided to get married in Italy. I was happy and excited for her obviously. We talked about the dates, accommodations and everything we needed for this wedding. I discovered that I could not afford to travel for this wedding I told her that I didn't have the money to travel to Italy and she immediately began screaming at me, telling me You agreed to be a part of this wedding so figure it out I explained to her that when we talked about her wedding before she got engaged it was going to be a small wedding in our hometown, now it has turned into something bigger that I just can't afford.

All my other bridesmaids are coming so why can't you? I felt horrible for it but I told her I had to drop out of being in her wedding as it was expensive to travel, find accommodations, pay for my dress. All of it added up was too much for my budget.

When I discovered the circumstances and amount of the money left, it was obvious my sister (the executor, the POA and caretaker) hid this from us and that it would\u2019ve been a life changing amount of money for each of the beneficiaries on my mother\u2019s will, which states equal splits. We are going to confront her about this and give her the opportunity to fess up and make right to each sibling with the remaining amount and not even be penalized for what she\u2019s spent, so long as she\u2019s compliant and upfront. Honestly I just feel like an asshole wishing there was another way to handle it and fearing she will always resent me for outting this secret. AITA for not giving her a chance to fix it before sharing info with my siblings, even though shes already lied so many times about it and I didn\u2019t feel she\u2019d admit it in this approach? UPDATE: Thanks to everyone who responded. I appreciate the help getting in the right headspace about this. I finally have documented physical evidence now showing there is still quite a lot of $ left- just had to get on a plane and return to my mothers house to fortunately find a paper trail... Will update again. UPDATE: My siblings and I have developed how we want to approach this with her and the oldest is traveling into town as we speak so we are doing this in four hours. We have a lawyer on retainer. If she shows anything but full compliance, we will be forced to continue with legal action which includes removing her as executor and trying to validate the old will which divides the house four ways as well. I stayed up all night photographing documents proving her abuse of power of attorney, fraudulent actions and her self serving interests in hiding assets. She will be returning soon to my moms house (the house left to her in the possibly forged will but which is not in her name yet so she does not have possession of) which is when we will confront her\u2026  My sister has appeared kind and even \u201cgenerous\u201d at times to her friends and to her family. If there wasn\u2019t actual evidence proving these actions, no one that ever met her would believe she could be capable of this. UPDATE: After the initial shock of confrontation, my sister broke down in tears and spat out some swan song final lie about my mothers wishes being that she keep the money and keep it a secret. However she also said she never intended on allowing this money to not be split, but instead wanted to allow it to appreciate for a little longer to increase its total value before surprising us with our inheritance. Honestly, I know she\u2019s lying about that to save face/ maybe she believes that because it makes her feel better. It truly doesn\u2019t matter anymore why or what happened now that she is showing us account information and agreeing to the amounts she will begin transferring to each of us tomorrow after we ALL get to talk to her financial advisor. Legal action scared her and I\u2019m grateful these funds will be recovered. To the rest of it, let sleeping dogs lie. You may say I should still pursue legal recourse but since this money is all I wanted to recover, I don\u2019t care about anything else. I will absolutely keep updating on the progress. If anything goes wrong, legal recourse will be taken.P.S. of course she said she wishes I would\u2019ve come to her first as she obviously would\u2019ve cleared up the misunderstanding. As if.  UPDATE : My sister opened our conversation this morning with trying to get me on a flight home. She\u2019s completely changed her mind now and is pursing legal action. So are we. I\u2019m so angry right now. ",

        "selftext": "Writing the title makes me feel like I'm the asshole no matter what. But it's not exactly about the clothing. Let me describe my situation first. I (34M) met my wife (36F) 4 years ago. We got ~~engaged~~ married after 1 year together. We have a 2-year-old daughter. We\u2019re both working freelance, and her income is usually two or three times more than mine. We work equally in terms of time spent. When one person is working, the other takes care of the baby. As she earns more, she spends more. She treats herself and the family members (1 child and 2 cats) at her level of income. For example, we dine out a bit too much (I try to cook, not bad, but she usually doesn\u2019t feel like eating at home). She loves to buy expensive fruit over the affordable ones, or buy costly clothing, bags, or a top-of-the-line rice cooker. At the same time, she wants to feel equal in providing for the family. I try my best (I always sleep later and wake up earlier) to meet her expectations (and maybe haven't met them yet?), so I always run out of money every month. Every time I bring this into conversation, it\u2019s always \u201cI have the right to use my money.\u201d There's no way to get her to spend at the same rate as my income (which is above average in my city). -------- She used to work in the fashion industry, so she\u2019s a bit picky about what she wears. I never thought about sitting down with her to write down every item on her wishlist. Because what she can buy, she already buys; and what she can\u2019t buy, I can\u2019t help her with. At least, that\u2019s what I think. So, today, she bought a Chanel lipstick (first time after 3 years) and I (intended to say let me pay) asked for the price, and she replied $50. I said, \u201cWow, a $50 lipstick? Normal people can never use this.\u201d I can\u2019t afford it at the moment, so I didn\u2019t suggest paying for her either. She felt disappointed because of what I said, and because I never buy her any significant things except on birthdays (her last birthday\u2019s gift was a small necklace worth 1/5 of my monthly income) and some special occasions in the 4 years we've been living together. Apart from occasional flowers, I rarely buy her any significant gifts in daily life because I never save enough for this. I mean, it\u2019s not my priority to buy her excessive stuff that she doesn\u2019t really need. So, AITA for not putting my wife's girly stuff more on top of my priority? ----  **EDIT:** As everybody mention about the 50$ lipstick, I must say it's not a big deal for something you will use in 3 years. I just not prepare for that (I thought around 20$ to 30$), so it shock me and I say it out so unthoughtfully. Yep, so her point is not about this lipstick but the fact that I rarely buy her nice stuffs apart from special events. As I can see, my reason as not saving enough for this kind of stuffs is weak and kind of the excuses. On the other hand, we should have more conversation on how the expense is splitted. **EDIT2:** I read all of your comments and feel very thankful. Since this is the first time I tell my story in Reddit and I don't know what to expect. I just try to put on a short version of the situation for not wasting your time. Apparently, it lacks of some information and clarification. I want to answers some FAQ below and give my conclusion. **1. Is she usually have gifts for me? What are those?**  She gifted me many shirts (5 to 7) and pants (~3) in the first year we met, not so after that. She gift me 3 birthday presents - a coat, a helmet, and a phone (a decent 2nd-hand phone I choose to replace my broken one). I don't really remember anything else recently. Now looking back, I can tell how she's obsessed with fashion and want to put nice clothes on me. I feel thankful, for sure, but you see, those things are practically good, but too boring.  My birthdays gift for her is an Instax Camera, a wooden music box with horses cart riding the marrying couple (which turn out to be our's daughter favorite toy...), and a necklace (her choice). I tried to be creative. **2. Do I know that what she want is only a tangible gift to show her my love?** Yes, I know. She told this directly to me. In my defend, I want to shout out that my financial strain caused by following her lifestyle so I could hardly budget anything even for myself (I'm not doing that, I'm writing here to ask for your help instead). I bought her flowers once every two months. I bought snacks and small gifts (funny key chains, etc) occasionally. But those things is too easy to buy so maybe she dismissed it. **3. Do we have joint account? Do we really pay 50/50?** We used to have a joint account (and we put 50/50 into it), somehow it's complicated to handle it so we dismiss it after 2 or 3 months of marriage and spend on our own. Yes, we target for 50/50 on essential things. The renting, the kids (daughter and cats) expense, the market's foods and dine out meal, health care, daily stuffs,.... It's vary depend on every months. But I could say she paying more in general. It could be something between 55/45 to 60/40.  Even I pay less, my money is running out frequently. (For example, she pay 1000$ and I pay 800$). She still have a big deal of money to spend on clothes and sandals and accessories for her and our daughter (more than what their need), expensive fruits and snacks, milk tea,... After that, she still remains some for saving. **4. Does she a materialistic person?** No, I don't think so. I think it's because our love language is un-align.  For example, I touch her and say I love her a lot, but she doesn't enjoy doing that. She usually said it's not the words matter, the actions (gifts?) matter. I spend time with her, listen to her more than enough, and she think that's just obvious couple's obligations. Maybe I should know better about her love language. **5. My conclusion** As many of you pointed out, the question is why I'm still staying here, in the financial strain situation.  I must have a real talk with her (or us with counselor) to set up an equitable expense, not equally expense. Following that, we should have a joint account. I should also budget for some gifts, which is her go-to love language. Thank you very much for supporting me. I can't see how I get through this without your words. I hope I can give you a best UPDATE as I can.",

        "selftext": "Greetings good folks of Reddit, The title pretty much sums up the situation. My father owns a rental property, which we live in, and the remaining 2 units are rented out. Tenant #2, who we will call Mary, drops off her rental check in our mail box. If she is on vacation, or otherwise going away for an extended period of time, she\u2019ll give her rent before she leaves. Sometimes, her brother will bring the rent by to us on her behalf when she is away. It always gets dropped off in our mailbox. Tenant #1, who we will call Juan, does not like to use our mailbox to drop off his rent check. He insists on dropping off his rent in person to whoever is home. If no one is home, or we don\u2019t get back until really late, then he will try again the next day. We\u2019ve told him the mailbox is fine, but he insists on in-person delivery, as he is afraid of check theft/check washing. This would be fine\u2026 except he doesn\u2019t wait for us to open the door. He knocks, rings the doorbell, and when I get to the top of the stairs and look down, he already has the door open and is waiting by the bottom of the stairs. We live on the top floor. The door to our house opens up to a staircase, which leads up to the kitchen to one side and the hallway to the family room on the other side. Unless we lock the door, which we don\u2019t necessarily do during the daytime when we are home, he just opens the door and lets himself in (never going further than the landing at the bottom of the stairs). Today, he came by to drop off the rent. As expected, he rang the doorbell and was waiting at the bottom of the stairs, having let himself in. I asked him -painfully polite as I am terrified of confrontation- \u201cHi Juan! Next time, can you please wait for one of us to open the door?\u201d He looked like I cursed his ancestors, spat in his face, and shit on his carpet. He said \u201cYou don\u2019t want me to open the door?\u201d I said we would prefer if he waited for one of us to open the door for him. He said he opens the door because he doesn\u2019t know if our doorbell works. I assured him, with a smile on my face, that it does work, and that we hear it loud and clear whenever he rings it. He said okay and left, visibly upset. Guys, I cannot emphasize enough how much I hate confrontation, and what a people pleaser I am. I was smiling the entire time, asked him how he and his family were doing, and was pleasant the entire time. He looked at me like I spoke some unimaginable horror. Am I crazy Reddit? Is it wrong of me to have asked Juan to wait by the door to our home until one of us opens it? I feel like not wanting someone to let themselves into your home isn\u2019t a big ask, but he looked so offended, that I am going crazy questioning myself over it. I leave it to you guys to pass judgment. Edit to add a few things: Bumping up edit 4: Additional edit to clarify that **the front door is locked 24/7**. It is the back door that is left unlocked for a small window in the middle of the day, and only when someone is home. 1. The door is locked the majority of the time. There is a *small* window of a few hours in the middle of the day, only when someone is home, that my parents (the actual homeowners) will leave the door unlocked to allow family to come in. 2. I am not the homeowner. I would keep the door locked 24/7 if I was. 3. To the person who said they\u2019d like to see my reaction if something actually important happened in my life, when I said I am \u201cgoing crazy\u201d it was just hyperbole. I am more so confused at the tenant\u2019s strong reaction. 4. Additional edit to clarify that **the front door is locked 24/7**. It is the back door that is left unlocked for a small window in the middle of the day, and only when someone is home. 5. Additional edit to add that my parents don\u2019t care how the tenants pay, whether it is a paper check or an e-transfer. The tenants are older, and prefer to deal with paper checks. 6. I said what I did to Juan **at the request of my parents**.",

        "selftext": "My parents got divorced and my mom moved out. I was still living at the house with my dad and I was covering the utilities which I agreed to help. I had been with my girlfriend(now fianc\u00e9e at the time of their divorce). Well I pretty much moved in with her and was staying at her house during the week and going home on the weekends. It eventually changed to never really going back home unless I needed to speak to my dad about something. He\u2019s been a heavy drinker for most of my life which he still is at this point. Me and my fianc\u00e9e have a baby on the way and we\u2019ve been looking for a place to live and we found one. The only bad thing about the whole situation is that my dad is looking as well and he\u2019s been bugging me about co-signing on a loan with him to get a house but he keeps telling me that he\u2019s going to pay it off with the money from house when it sells. But he\u2019s been saying that we could all move in together and I just don\u2019t think it would be a good idea with the baby and I also don\u2019t feel comfortable doing it and I explained to him because of mine and fianc\u00e9es situation. But anyways, yesterday me and her went to my dads house(that\u2019s currently being sold) to pack some stuff up and he was leaving to go take a walk and he said to me that \u201cI killed him for not co-signing with him\u201d. I\u2019m feeling really guilty about it and it\u2019s been tugging at my heart. I just want to know\u2026 Am I the asshole and in the wrong for not helping him? Or should I have helped and jeopardized me and my fianc\u00e9e\u2019s future?  -EDIT-Okay so I apologize to everyone that has replied about not providing enough information I was typing this out on my phone and didn\u2019t want a massive paragraph for everyone to read. So I\u2019m going to answer some of the questions that I was seeing in the comments. Me(M26) and my fianc\u00e9e (F27) have been together since 2018 and have a baby on the way that will be born in May. We are going through the buying process of a home currently. My father and mother are getting half of the money that the house is being sold for after the remaining balance of the house is paid but the only reason he wants me to co-sign on the loan is because his credit isn\u2019t the best. He got a DUI a couple years ago so he doesn\u2019t car so he basically relies on me to take him places which I don\u2019t mind taking if I have time and it\u2019s places like the grocery store, appointments, etc. but I feel like he\u2019s been getting pretty comfortable with it cause he doesn\u2019t ask me anymore just basically demands that I do it now.

        "selftext": "I don\u2019t really know what to do but I\u2019m really anxious and upset about this. a few months ago, my kitten poked some holes in my roommates gaming chair. it\u2019s a 300 dollar chair. she told me about it and i took some pictures of the damage. the holes aren\u2019t deep but there are little bits of leather peeling. i told her i could get something to fix it, but eventually i told her that i would pay for it to get fixed bc i didn\u2019t trust my skills.  today she sent me a long paragraph about how my kitten has been chewing her decorative flowers, chewing her cables and headphones to the point where they don\u2019t work, and that her chair is still ruined and she wants reimbursement for it.  i showed my parents and they agreed to 100% pay for a new chair if she gave us the ruined chair. this chair really isn\u2019t \u201cruined,\u201d it just has a few little holes that i could probably crudely fix with glue. we assumed she was going to scrap the chair because of how she presented it (\u201che (my cat) fucked it up\u201d) but I didn\u2019t want it to go to waste. i also could sell the chair for some of the money back. she said she wants to keep the ruined chair. when my mom saw that she said this, she flipped out. i understand why. my mom said that\u2019s basically giving her a gift, not a reimbursement. my roommate said she wanted to keep the chair so that she can have one chair in her room at the apartment, and one in her room at her parents house so she doesn\u2019t have to bring it back and forth.  the way she worded this ircked me a lot. my parents 100% agreed that if she doesn\u2019t give us her ruined chair, we are not paying anything for a new one for her. she\u2019s really mad at this. when i got home she was crying about how her stuff is ruined, and how my cat got into her cables and broke her headphones. i told her she should keep her door closed from now on like our other roommates do, that way there\u2019s no chance he\u2019ll (my cat) get in and he\u2019ll get used to not being in the room, like he did with our other roommates. she kept the door open, and low and behold he walked right into her room. she then cried more about him being in there.  i\u2019m going to keep my cat in my room from now on, only letting him out when i\u2019m home to supervise. he has plenty of toys, wall shelves to climb, and things to do in my room. everything is in here, so it\u2019ll just be a bit of an adjustment for him. she\u2019s been texting me for the entire rest of the night talking about how her stuff is ruined and shes saying things like \u201cwhat do i do?\u201d and \u201ci don\u2019t know what to do\u201d. i\u2019m starting to think she\u2019s trying to guilt me into giving her the money. am i overreacting to this? should i give her the money? i dont know what to do.  EDIT: I should probably add that my roommate will actively seek out my cat while he\u2019s in my room to bring into her room, that\u2019s where the problem lies. I try to keep him separated from precious materials, but I\u2019m not always there to supervise.  my cat is NOT destructive as most people are saying. he has never ripped apart anything. her chair is the thing she\u2019s upset about, but the only other thing my cat has gotten into is her headphone cable. but my cat doesn\u2019t go around chewing and scratching things. he didn\u2019t scratch her chair, either. it was holes poked from him walking on it and putting out his claws a bit. neither me nor my other roommates have ever had a problem.  EDIT/UPDATE: 2/6/25 Thanks guys for the comments. I took lots of your advice and me and my roommate were able to \u201ctalk it out\u201d (she came to me and apologized profusely). I think my roommates mom is still upset though, because her mom called MY mom and bitched about it apparently. I wasn\u2019t there, but that\u2019s what my mom said happened. Anyways thanks a bunch for helping me not spiral into a panic attack! ",

        "selftext": "I really didn\u2019t mean to cause any harm with this, but I\u2019m 24 hours everything has blown up. I (17f) had the first day of school yesterday. It\u2019s my final year of high school, and I\u2019m pretty involved with school clubs, so I know a lot of people even though I\u2019m not popular and not involved with much drama, until no. On the way home I saw some friends I hadn\u2019t talked to over the holidays and while chatting one of them brought up a girl we can call Layla (16f). Two of my friends had heard that Layla was telling people her sister Cassidy (18f) who graduated last year is now pregnant. I knew Cassidy and even though we weren\u2018t close friends, she was always super nice. None of us really believed it, but they had both heard it separately, and thought it was weird. I thought since Cassidy wasn\u2019t at school to defend herself or even hear about it, someone should tell her that people in Y11 and Y12 were hearing it. So I dm\u2019d her on instagram telling her what I\u2019d heard, said I didn\u2019t believe it, and didn\u2019t really expect a response. She messaged me back thanking me and asking a few question, and I thought I\u2019d done the right thing. Apparently not, because today Layla found me at lunch and yelled at me for messaging her sister. Turns out their mum saw the message and now they have family drama, and are blaming Cassidy for the rumour being spread, not Layla. Layla said she had no idea the rumour was spreading at all, and she had no part in it. Layla also said I had no right inserting myself in family drama, and if the I heard one of Cassidy\u2019s friends spread the rumour it would have been fine, but since I thought it was her, I should have gone to Layla first, not Cassidy. She was yelling so loud and for so long teachers got involved and tried to set up meetings for us and potentially our parents as well, but I said it wasn\u2019t necessary. I apologised to Layla for causing family drama, but said I didn\u2019t feel bad for telling Cassidy what was being said about her, because I thought she deserved to find out as soon as possible. Layla said I wasn\u2019t Cassidy\u2019s friend, and not to see her, talk to her, or message her again. Even so, I messaged Cassidy an apology for starting family drama, which I am genuinely sorry for. She hasn\u2019t responded, and I don\u2019t expect her to. But even so, I don\u2019t think I was the asshole for telling Cassidy there was a pregnancy rumour about her.   EDIT for clarity: Cassidy is not pregnant and Layla said she didn\u2019t start it or tell anyone",

        "selftext": "Hello! Longtime lurker, first time poster here. I (25F) went to a friend\u2019s wedding a few months ago. The friends are Matt (25M), and Susan (25F). We\u2019re all part of a much larger friend group that gets along pretty great. To preface, I have actually never attended a wedding before in my life, and I don\u2019t tend to dress up or put on makeup. Nothing against it, it\u2019s just expensive and time consuming and I work 16-hour days in a uniform. I was really excited when I got the invite, saved up, and went to a shop I know carries my size (I\u2019m fairly tall). The clerk was amazing and so helpful. He chose a selection of dresses that would be wedding appropriate that weren\u2019t close to what the bridal party would be wearing and we had a lot of fun trying things on and he hyping me up. One of the options I just fell in love with. It was a beautiful dark green silk \u201cbias-cut\u201d dress (think Kiera Knightley in Atonement, without the sash and less of a flowing skirt). We matched it with heels and I\u2019d never felt prettier. The dress was on sale too, so that was a plus! Wedding day comes and it\u2019s lovely. I\u2019m so happy for my friends. Susan ignores me, which is weird, but she\u2019s busy preparing and then the wedding is in full swing and the reception is busy so I don\u2019t think much of it. Everything goes off without a hitch and they drive off to their honeymoon. I suppose it\u2019s relevant, but I received several compliments on my outfit during the event. I didn\u2019t think it caused a scene, and it wasn\u2019t anything particularly effusive or over the top. I was doing the same to others so I didn\u2019t think it stood out.Everything concludes, we all have a nice time. No one says anything until tonight. We all got together for a \u201cWelcome Back!\u201d dinner for Matt and Susan. During the dinner Susan kept making snipes at me about what I wore, just incredibly passive aggressive. It was very clear she thought I overdressed. I didn\u2019t say anything at the time because I felt terrible. None of my friends corrected or stopped her either. But looking back on it I feel\u2026 wronged? She didn\u2019t give me the benefit of the doubt and I don\u2019t feel like my dress was over-the-top. I do think I likely look very different from how I normally dress and present myself, so that might be part of it?  I\u2019m trying not to go over the word limit but am very open to questions and elaborations if needed.  So Reddit, AITA?  TLDR: wore a nice dress to a wedding, the bride is angry ever since. AITA?  Alright, my update was way too long and I honestly don\u2019t know if I can shorten it and it still give all the details - so I\u2019m going to be posting it on my own profile. ",

        "selftext": "We are a family of 13 people and three generations. Our family is very close, and we love family reunions. However, my brother often relies on our father to pay for his family's travel expenses, which has become an expectation. My husband and I always pay our own way, and my sister also pays for herself and sometimes for her nieces and nephews. My brother and his wife, on the other hand, expect the best accommodations and meals without contributing financially. They also tend to make plans with other friends and ditch us during vacations. My brother and his wife earn about the same as my husband and me, and our parents are retired school teachers living on a fixed income. Due to financial limitations, our family reunions have become less frequent. My husband and I still go on vacation with our kids every year, sometimes joined by my sister and mom. My dad has physical limitations and only travels when he is well enough. My kids have been requesting a trip to my homeland, where we have many distant relatives. We decided to keep our plans quiet to avoid being hijacked by the family. We booked an Airbnb and only told my sister, who decided to join us. This created an issue with my parents, as they expected her to visit them. My mom eventually bought plane tickets for herself and dad using air miles, without telling dad. So, it's now the eight of us going, and we decided not to invite anyone else due to financial constraints. I recently learned that my brother and his wife were also planning the same trip but with her friends. When they saw the cost, my brother called dad, hoping he would pay for it. However, my parents have faced financial hardships recently. Dad did not fund my brother's trip, and mom secretly told my brother about our plans, asking him to reach out to me. He never called and canceled his plans. My sister accidentally told one of our nieces about the trip, who then informed her parents. My sister-in-law was furious, she told me she would have invited us if they were planning a trip.  I told her I knew of her travel plans and we were not included. I then suggested we all go on a family cruise and would be happy to plan it.  I reached out twice with the suggestion, but she has not responded. ",

        "selftext": "I 44F have been divorced from my ex husband 41M for the last 13 years. We have 2 kids, 15M, and 13F, together. He is remarried to 33F and has 2 additional boys with her. They are 11 and 10.  They have been legally separated for the last 2 years and live in differnt states. She has continued to be in our kids lives and we all have agreed to keep the sibling bond strong amoung all 4 kids.  Last year she started taking the kids on seperate trips but 2 at a time to celebrate thier birthdays. One of her boys and my daughter went to Las Vegas (out of state for all of us) with her for their birthdays. And she took my son and her other son on a white water rafting trip for thier birthdays. Again out of state for her and her son.  A couple of days ago out of the blue my daughter was on FaceTime with step mom and my daughter asked to go on a overseas trip with just her step mom for 4 days over spring break. I asked if we could make a girls trip, so I could also go, and my daughter said no. I suggested something in county just the 2 of them and step mom is refusing that idea. My ex asked if he could go and my daughter said no. She just wants to spend time with step mom alone.  She claims to be a last minute planner and does not currently have a booked or planned out itinerary. And when I told step mom I wasn\u2019t comfortable with my daughter going alone with her she lost her mind. She is claiming I am robbing her of this amazing expirence out of jealously. I feel as if she is buying her affection and overstepping every parenting boundary there is under the sun. And completely disregarding my parenting decisions and disrespecting me as mom.  Ex supports daughter traveling with her alone and has basically washed his hands of the argument. She is ready to bring this to a court to force my hand. I hate this. I am not ok with my 13 year old dictating travel plans with out my input or censent.  Everything in me says this is not a good idea. I don\u2019t trust step mom, and I don\u2019t trust air travel right now  and with the state of the world I don\u2019t think traveling with out bio parent is a good idea.  So AITA?  ",

        "selftext": "Sorry if this is long or confusing, I\u2019ve never used Reddit before. I (26F) have been having an issue with my cousin \u201cEmma\u201d (29F) that has gotten the whole family involved, and I need some outside perspective. Our grandfather hadn\u2019t been in great health the past few years, and over the past month or two he\u2019d really gone downhill. He was admitted to the hospital a couple of weeks ago in full-on kidney failure. We\u2019d known this was coming- about a year ago a doctor had told us his kidney function was really poor and since he decided not to do dialysis, he had maybe a year left to live (turns out that doctor was exactly right). I\u2019d been to visit him in the hospital a few evenings after work, and it was rough; he wasn\u2019t too coherent and I knew there wasn\u2019t much they could do. It was sad but not really unexpected; he was 85 and like I said, health had been bad for a while.  Anyway, Emma\u2019s job doesn\u2019t have a typical 9-5 schedule, so it\u2019s easier for her to visit him at the hospital in the mornings. A few days ago I was at work when, at about 10 am, I checked Facebook on my phone. The first thing I saw was a long post from Emma announcing that our grandfather had died. Needless to say, that was NOT the way I wanted to find out. I commented telling Emma that it was wrong to post this without first making sure the whole family knew, and she should take the post down.  Just a few minutes later my father texted asking me to call him, and when I did he told me what I already knew. Turns out Emma had made her Facebook post less than an hour after he died, when there were still a lot of family members that didn\u2019t know. I wasn\u2019t the only one who found out via that post, and none of us were too happy about it. A couple of days later my uncle (Emma\u2019s dad) told me he\u2019d specifically told Emma to wait until she knew family had been notified before posting anything (we all know how obsessed with social media she is). He was livid when he learned she\u2019d posted about it so quickly despite him telling her not to. At the memorial service Emma confronted me, saying I\u2019d \u201cembarrassed\u201d her by making my comment on her Facebook post. Apparently some of her friends had seen my comment and agreed that it had been wrong of her to post the news so quickly. A lot of people are mad at her for it, and she\u2019s claiming that I \u201cturned friends and family against her\u201d by calling her out in my comment. This has just added a bunch of extra stress to an already tough situation, and I really want an outside opinion on if making the comment was wrong. ",

        "selftext": "First off all the disclaimers: Sorry for formatting I am on my phone and also English us not my first language so I apologize for any errors. I (34f) broke up with my Ex Boyfriend (40m) last June, so a little over 7 months ago. There wasnt any big blowout reason, the relationship just didn't work out for me. I put in all the effort while he always provided the bare minimum and at some point I just didn't feel like taking care of a grown ass man anymore. It was really hard on him and he kept texting me for a while. I replied politely but also told him he needs to move on. It was just too little too late. I know I may sound coldhearted but I had my reasons to break up with him and I didn't really want to stay in constant contact or keep being friends. So yesterday I was out with my siblings and he randomly calls me. I have a tendency to people pleasing so my sister took my phone, rejected the call and texted him that I was unavailable due to being out with them.He texted back asking me to call him when I was available because something bad happened.  So I finally grew a spine and told him I couldn't provide him emotional support and to please understand. He then texted me that his mother had passed away and he just needed someone to talk to and how could I be so cold towards him.This is where I might be the asshole because I still did not want to call him and be his emotional support. I just want to stay out of this and as sad as I am for him I don't want to be involved in this. So am I the Asshole?",

        "selftext": "I (21M) moved out at 18 for work and college. My family always praised how independent and happy I became. Two years ago, I started dating a high school friend (we\u2019re both men), and a year later, he moved in. I hid our relationship because my family is from a small conservative town and has outdated views\u2014my dad thinks LGBT+ people \u201cjust do it for attention.\u201d Last weekend, I finally told them. I started by explaining I\u2019m *aroace*, which is why I never introduced anyone before. They said they didn\u2019t want me to be alone and should give more people a chance. Then I revealed I\u2019ve had a boyfriend for two years. The irony? The type of relationship they always described as perfect for me is exactly the one I have. Their reaction was awful. My dad prayed at the table and went silent. My mom cried in her room, saying I ruined her dream of grandkids (even though I told them years ago I don\u2019t want kids). When I got home, she texted: *Your dad is really upset and won\u2019t accept this. Please give us time. You\u2019re always welcome at home, but [my boyfriend] coming wouldn\u2019t be good. I love you, even if it\u2019s not what I expected, and I just ask you to respect us too.* I just replied *Ok, I understand.* But I don\u2019t know if I do. I feel like my happiness is something they need to digest. Now, I\u2019m considering not visiting them or allowing them in my home until they accept my boyfriend. It seems fair\u2014if my relationship isn\u2019t accepted in their house, then they shouldn\u2019t be welcome in mine until they respect it. But part of me feels guilty, like I might be \u201casking too much\u201d from people with such a closed mindset. The immediate issue: tomorrow, they\u2019re delivering a fridge (a gift from last year) while my boyfriend and I are at work. I\u2019ve tried hiring delivery before, but it\u2019s hard to carry a fridge up three flights of stairs. I suspect they\u2019ll wait for us to get home, and I *don\u2019t* want to see them. After everything, I don\u2019t want to pretend things are normal. AITA for refusing to see them and cutting contact until they accept my boyfriend? EDIT RESPONSE TO COMMENTS: I\u2019ve seen a lot of responses in a short time\u2014thank you to everyone who took the time to reply. I wanted to add some missing details and context that I left out in the original post. * **English is not my first language**, so I didn\u2019t realize that cutting off sounds extreme. That\u2019s not what I meant\u2014I don\u2019t plan to completely cut them out of my life, just to stop visiting them or having them over until they accept my boyfriend (we live two hours apart).* As I mentioned, my boyfriend was my **high school friend**, and my dad never liked him, even before we were dating. He used to call him the Brazilian equivalent of *faggot* behind his back and got angry whenever I mentioned his name. I lost a lot of friendships because of my family's homophobia, but this was the first one I refused to let go of just because my dad disapproved.* The reason I decided to tell them **after two years** is that they kept giving me positive feedback about my emotional well-being and quality of life. So I thought, *if they\u2019ve been so happy with my changes since I\u2019ve been with him, why would they see him as a bad influence?** One of the worst things my mom said to me privately was: *I never thought about having another child, but after what you told me, I reconsidered.* That really hurt me.* I **do believe they can change** (especially my mom), but I know it will be difficult. They\u2019ve always struggled to understand even basic things about me, like the fact that I\u2019m **introverted and autistic** with sensory sensitivities. Ever since I was a kid, they would drag me to loud parties, and when I got overwhelmed or didn\u2019t enjoy them, they blamed me for not trying to have fun. Even after I got my **autism diagnosis** as an adult, my dad still refuses to acknowledge it.* Since I moved out, I **pay for my own college, rent, and transportation** without any family support (aside from occasional gifts that I never ask for).* About the **fridge**, it was a **Christmas gift** they bought for me, but the Brazilian postal service kept saying they would deliver it and never did. I even took time off work to be home, only for them to never show up. Eventually, my mom got a refund and bought another one closer to her house (two hours away). They had already planned to deliver it before I even brought up this issue. I feel like **I should take it so they can\u2019t use it as leverage against me.*** They have **a spare key to my place**, which was never an issue before (my mistake in hindsight). I\u2019m now considering staying home tomorrow to receive the fridge myself and **take my key back.** Again, thanks for all the insights and perspectives\u2014I really appreciate it.",

        "selftext": "So 5 years ago me, my brother, and 2 other good friends we\u2019ve known for 20+ years planned a big trip to ski in Europe.  A year ago we started talking about doing it again for my 40th birthday but skiing in Japan this time.  We also decided to open up the invite to a specific few others that we all knew well from college and who wished they were invited on the last trip.  Two more committed so now our group was 6 people.  A couple weeks ago one friend Payton (name changed for privacy purposes) asked my brother Johny who was planning the entire trip if he could invite his half brother.  Johny told him politely no because nobody else knew him and adding a 7th would mess with logistics (guides, dinner reservations and hotel reservations) and the vibe would be different having someone there nobody knows.  Payton wasn\u2019t happy and said \u201cbut I thought we were opening up the trip to others\u201d to which Johny reminded him that was only to specific people we\u2019ve all known since college.  Well a week later Johny told people nobody can back out at this point because our most expensive hotel reservation was becoming non-refundable to which everyone confirmed they were not backing out.  4 days after this and a month before the trip, Payton tells my brother Johny and myself his half brother is coming and he\u2019s not going to be rude and uninvite him and we are being jerks for saying he can\u2019t come.  He apologizes for misunderstanding that we only opened up the invite to certain people but refuses to un-invite his half brother.  We tell him if he\u2019s truly sorry, he\u2019ll tell his brother it was a miscommunication and he\u2019ll do another trip with him.  He refuses and says he and his brother are coming on the trip and following the exact same itinerary whether we like it or not.  All 5 other members of the group call him and tell him what he\u2019s doing is very socially awkward and selfish to bring this all up after flights and hotels were non-refundable.  He still refuses to change course.  So we changed our logistics now to expel him from the ski group with guides and we aren\u2019t letting him stay in the rooms we booked and we plan to not hang out with him on the trip but he and his half brother will be on all the same flights and likely staying at same hotels which will be awkward.  Who is in the wrong here and how should this situation be handled? ",

She has no understanding of boundaries, overshares, can be very rude... The type that picks a vegan restaurant then complains to the waitress that they don't have bacon & eggs. Kyle wants to have a good relationship with her but it's hard. I'm polite with Mary but spending time with her is difficult. I actually suggested the trip because she regularly complains that Kyle spends more time with his father than with her, and I know it makes him feel bad. One evening towards the end of the trip, we were all sitting together watching TV and the conversation drifted to Kyle's father, John. John is a generally good guy, and both Kyle and I have a good relationship with him. Mary & him were never together as a couple. Mary started saying mean things about Kyle's father, then suddenly went off about him, telling us how he's a terrible person and now he's got a cushy little life because of all the money from the settlement. Kyle's father is a victim of malpractice, he went in for a routine operation and ended up heavily handicapped. He almost died & had to stop working. He sued and got money from the hospital. I got angry and told her to stop this type of talk and that considering he almost died and was handicapped for life, it was hardly cushy. She told me she could say whatever she liked and that he'd made her life hard back in the days so she could be mean now. I answered I didn't have to stay and listen to this type of shit and left for bed. Afterwards Kyle told me he hadn't said anything because he was so used to it but he was happy I'd told her to stop. The next day she didn't talk about the argument. Three weeks after we left, Kyle called her to get some news. She told him that we had hurt her when we were are her place, and that she found my attitude disrespectful and mean. I feel kind of insane right now so: am I the asshole?",

        "selftext": "Just started working for my dad last month after he told me his business was doing well and it's a sector I have experience in. He said it would be alot of hours/hard work and I was happy to still start. First month worked 50+ hours per week and he paid in full (\u00a312.50/hour). At the start of this month he said he'd make me a director of the company as it meant paying me was more tax effective and that was fine with me. Fast forward to today and I get my payslip and it's only for \u00a31900 for the month (at 12.50 per hour is should have been 2500+). So I sent him a text to let him know he had underpaid me and got a snarky text back about being on a \u00a32000/month salary now. This equates to under minimum wage as I worked 200 hours this month. When I said this to him he said he was so disappointed and made out I was being ungrateful for the opportunity to be a part of the business and that he worked 70+ hours per week setting the business up. I asked him if I could switch back to per hour wages instead of a fixed salary and he told me to find a new job. I don't think he's serious about this (I think maybe he's just having a bad day or something) but I'm unsure what to do and his strong reaction makes me think maybe I am in the wrong? Would love some advice. TL:DR - Switched from per hour to fixed salary and now earning under minimum wage, asked to switch back and told that I am being ungrateful",

We\u2019ve been working on a major research project, and while we were supposed to have made a lot more progress by now, my group has been doing the most basic parts of the work. My group has been kind of a mess, with me being the youngest (just turned 17 in september), and the oldest being 21 (M). Everything was going fine until recently. I had been working hard, staying up late to meet the deadline, making sure all the research and papers were in order. I even reached out to validators to ensure everything was accurate. It seemed like we were on track. But then, my groupmate\u2019s grandmother\u2014who isn\u2019t even involved in the project\u2014decided to talk to the teacher. She claimed that I was making her granddaughter's life harder, saying that she doesn't get enough sleep and that it was my fault. She even went as far as saying that I \u201cordered\u201d her granddaughter to do all the work. Honestly, I was in shock. Last time I checked, the groupmate (18 F) barely showed up to meetings and was often out with her friends at the arcade. Meanwhile, I had bags under my eyes from staying up late working on everything. When my teacher asked about the situation, they were confused because I was always the one doing the work. The teacher even asked if my groupmate had contributed at all, and all I could say was \u201cI guess\u201d because I honestly didn\u2019t know how else to respond. I just stayed silent the rest of the day. After that incident, I stopped working with the group altogether and started helping other groups instead.

I used to be 220, but I am making improvements to my lifestyle and working on my health so I have lost some weight (and plan to loose more since I am still technically obese.) I was talking with my friends about various topics, as one does, and somehow the topic of body size came up. I opened up to my friends about how I was insecure about the size of my body, and that it made basic tasks like shopping for clothes and doing exercise more challenging, and I told them that I was trying to improve upon myself. However, my friends said that talking about my body size was making them uncomfortable and that we should move on to a different topic, and that it was inconsiderate to talk about private details during casual conversations. I thought that that claim was ridiculous because the size of my body is not exactly... a secret. Still, I stopped talking about it, but I don't thinking that me talking about my body was an inconsiderate thing to do because we were on that topic, and my friends (who are slimmer than me) had also complained about their bodies, so I thought we were bonding over sharing our struggles and insecurities. (As friends do). I know people have their boundaries, but was I really being inconsiderate by opening up about the struggles that I face in my body size?  Edit: Some people were wondering about the context. It was a get-together with me and 3 other friends at one of the friend's house. We have known each other for 4 years (we met in college) and I would say we are pretty close. My friends started the conversation about bodies and insecurities and were talking about how they felt insecure about things like hip dips, cellulite, etc. and how they felt like they couldn't always find clothes that fit them well, so I thought my input was appropriate at the time.",

        "selftext": "This backstory is important for it to make sense later - My dad already died 11 years ago and he was adopted when he was a baby, someone left him on his adoptive parent's door. His parents named him and used their surname for my dad. In my country, it is illegal to add your surname to the adopted kid. But it was back in 50s, nobody cares that much.  My dad is the only adopted kid and the eldest of 5. Although he was adopted, he really loved the family and worked really hard to support them. He also had to leave his dreams behind just to support his small siblings. The siblings knew how hard my dad worked his ass off.  Grandparent already died as well 20+ years ago and left some inheritance. My dad was part of the inheritance due to having the same surname. My dad was promised by their siblings that he would get his portions. The inheritance took years to process due to missing documents etc.  All was good, untillll, my dad died. His siblings decided to remove his name from the inheritance saying he was adopted and not qualified to get the portions. His siblings kept pestering us to tell the lawyers the truth and back out from the inheritance. To be honest, we didn't care about the inheritance, but the way they treat us after my dad died, it hurts us. We felt being betrayed and who knew, just because of inheritance, they throw us like some trash. If my dad was here, surely he would be depressed seeing how his siblings treated us. He really loved them.  And since that moment, I vowed myself and let my family know that I will not join any family events and do not want to see them anymore. My siblings agreed, and my mom too agreed, but since she is the oldest sister-in law, she had to join the family events just to respect my dad. My mom told me that if my dad was here, he would want his family to be here to celebrate my wedding, and out of respect to my beloved dad, I should invite them. But I stand firm on my decision, they didn't respect my dad after he died, so why should I? I know, not inviting them will get them on nerves and will keep pestering my mom if I didn't invite them. And people will talk and it will look bad on my mom and my late dad. I really don't want my parent to get the bad reputation just because of I hate them. Buuutttt, I really don't want to invite them, I know I will have bad mood through out the wedding if I see their faces. And no, I am not close with the cousins. So I really don't mind. WIBTA?  ",

        "selftext": "Hey Reddit  I (24f) bought some pants a couple of months back from an online thrifting website. The pants are unique and I payed a reasonable amount for them. I asked for the measurements and they should fit my size. I was super excited to receive them. I\u2019ve struggled my whole life finding pants that fit my body type and this time yet again they didn\u2019t fit around my hips.  My friend (25f) is smaller than me. I\u2019ve given her pants and other clothes before I couldn\u2019t fit. Not that long ago I gave her some unique pants again found thrifting online and they fit her perfectly. She got to buy them for a cheap price. She loved them and wore them often and it honestly hurt to see the pants I was so excited to fit me actually fit her.  So this time around I got some pants that of course yet again are too small. Instead of showing them to my friend first, because she\u2019s a smaller fit, I decided to put them on sale online instead.  I showed her my profile on the online thrifting website and she saw the pants and she now insists on trying them on.  I\u2019m well aware that I\u2019m playing into my insecurities and my jealousy when telling her that I\u2019d rather sell them online for a stranger to wear them instead of her, because it hurts too much to see her wear the pants I got excited would fit me. I have explained this to her and she\u2019s thinks I\u2019m being very unreasonable.  So, am I the asshole for not letting my friend try the pants I recently bought - instead I want to sell them online? Am I playing too much into my insecurities - should I let her try the pants and let her buy them if they fit?  Edit: Update!First of all, selling clothes online came up as a conversation topic and I brought up that I just started selling online. She then wanted to see my profile and spotted the pants. I did not smear the pants in her face just for me to tell her she can\u2019t have them. In hindsight, maybe I should\u2019ve just not told her I started selling online but I swear to god it wasn\u2019t some kind of evil plan to make her envious of my pants and jerk her around. Second of all, I am not jealous that she is smaller than me. I\u2019m jealous she can fit the pants I put my time and effort into finding. Good thrift finds are hard to come by. Third of all, she was not mad at me for not letting her try them on. She just didn\u2019t understand my reasoning. To all of you saying I need serious help; I am actively seeking help for my insecurities and have been through therapy before. After almost 15 years of friendship, me and my friend are very close - almost a sister status. We read all your replies and it opened up a healthy and interesting conversation between the both of us which only made our friendship stronger.  Thanks to all of you. You helped me realise that it\u2019s okay for me to have insecurities and that my feelings are valid, but I see now and I agree with a lot of you that it\u2019s border-lining pettiness and I will try my best work against that sooooo: I let her try the pants on (!!) and oh well she didn\u2019t even fit them lol, but a good conversation came out of it and from now on I won\u2019t hide them from my friend but I will definitely demand the same price I\u2019m selling them for online.",

She\u2019s just accepted them and isn\u2019t doing anything to combat them, which tells me the problem will just get worse.

I didn't tell many people about the pay increase, but my brother (28M) found out and immediately asked me to help him pay off his debts. Now, to give some background, my brother has always struggled with money. (I think he might have a gambling problem.)

I\u2019ve helped him before, but honestly, it just doesn\u2019t seem to be helping him long term. He keeps making the same mistakes. I told him no this time. I suggested he start budgeting better, or maybe even talk to a financial advisor, but he didn\u2019t take it well. He\u2019s upset and now he\u2019s telling the rest of the family that I\u2019m being selfish. Some of them are on my side, but others think I should help him out because we\u2019re family, and I\u2019m in a better position now. I feel like I\u2019m not obligated to help him if he isn\u2019t willing to change his habits. But I also feel guilty because he\u2019s struggling. AITA for saying no?",

        "selftext": "I have (had) a friend from my childhood days. I'm M40, my wife is F40, my friend Julie was F38. Our son turns 9 tomorrow. I haven't spoken to Julie for the last about 7-8 years, but when we were in school, we were in the same clique, even though when we met, she was 13 and I was 15. She was really cool, and I will admit, we, the boys, all had a crush on her. It didn't go anywhere between us, and after a time, I left for another city, started dating my wife, and we were together already for several years, when Julie reached out to me via socials. We discussed her current relationship, how it was toxic and abusive, and she had to end it. When I discussed our conversations with my wife, I saw that she was kind of jealous. I stopped our conversations because I love my wife and didn't want her to worry. Then I found out Julie met another guy I knew from another friends group. They hit it off, got married, moved to our city. I met her once for drinks. I saw that Julie was truly happy in the new relationship, and that's what really mattered to me.  Two days ago, her husband reached out to me (again, we haven't been in touch for 7-8 years). He said that unfortunately Julie has passed away. He was very depressed and asked if I am able to be there for the service. He felt like he needed all support he could get (he has no relatives in the city we live in and only several friends). He said she spoke well of me, and he wanted there to be more people who knew her, at the service and afterwards. The service was today, on Saturday, but tomorrow is our son's birthday. I did ask my wife if she's OK with me going. She's very into the vibes, she has a lot of bad memories about the cemeteries, dead people, things like that. However, she said that if I want to, I should be the one to decide. We still had time for final preparations for the birthday, and today in the morning she even helped me pick the flowers for Julie. So, I went to the service, and reception afterwards, total of around 3 hours spent, then we went to the store together, spent some time with our son playing football, and went to the restaurant to pick up the cake. That's when the conversation kinda went sideways. Turns out she is very frustrated that I spent time in that place instead of happy busy preparations for the birthday, I am in a downed mood now, and she can't stop thinking about it, and she doesn't want to get any flowers tomorrow (I'm usually getting the flowers), and she will now never even go into that flower shop around the corner, because it's forever associated with picking up funeral flowers. I'm kinda at a loss. Yes, I knew that she has this anticemetery outlook, was I supposed to turn down the person explicitly asking me to come? Even if we haven't been in touch for several years, I didn't feel like it would be OK to turn down such an ask. And I really wanted to say goodbye.  Now, it does seem like I prioritised someone else over my own family. Even if a little bit. AITA?",

        "selftext": "My gf (21f) and I (23M) live together and lately I've been getting a little frustrated with how we handle household chores. I do pretty much everything... all the time. I cook, clean, do dishes, get groceries, you name it. I don't mind doing more, because I genuinely enjoy doing something nice for a partner, but it hurts me that she doesn't reciprocate back. I could make dinner 7 nights in a row, and she'll say no if I ask her to cook us some pasta the next night. Anyways, we had a discussion regarding chores and I expressed my issues. I said I don't mind doing more, but I need something from her. We decided that she would handle sweeping and cleaning the litter boxes. Seems simple enough, but two weeks go by and she doesn't do either, ever. This upset me, so one night when I was heading out and she was staying home, I asked her if she could clean the house. I had a lot going on that day, and didn't get to the chores I normally would. She hesitantly said yes, and did, but the next day she expressed how she didn't feel it was right for me to put it all on her. She says that since I work remote, I have more time to do chores, therefore it should be my responsibility. I was speechless. I normally do nearly everything, every single day Her commute is about 15 minutes, and she works on computers all day, just like me. I get it, I have the privilege of being able to wash some dishes in between work activities, which is why I don't mind doing more, but AITA for not wanting to do everything? It's not like I have ample time before she gets home, many nights I'm still doing chores while she comes home and smokes weed. She even got mad because while I was doing the dishes to cook us dinner, I asked her to get the sponges from her car once she walked in from work. She said I could have texted before she walked in. Sure, but like, I'm about to spend nearly an hour doing stuff for us but you can't take 1 minute to get a sponge? Sorry im ranting a bit, but am I crazy?? **tl;dr**  **My gf said that I should do all the chores because I work remote**",

        "selftext": "I (f26) and my fianc\u00e9 (m30) are getting married later this year and we've recently began sending out the invitations. We've said from the beginning that we're only inviting partners of family members if we know them and that we're not going to be inviting partners that we don't know or are in fairly new relationships. We hand delivered invitations to my fianc\u00e9's family and invited some partners (that we know and get along with well and have essentially been a part of the family as they've been around for a while), but other partners that we do not know have not been invited. I will note however that we haven't invited my mils partner as he's awful to my mil and we just do not like him for many reasons. Today we went to visit my fianc\u00e9's grandparents and before we were able to properly greet them his grandmother began yelling at us that were horrible for not inviting his cousins partners (who we do not know and they've not been together for more than a couple of months) and that we're selfish for not wanting to pay extra money to invite them all and that family should come first regardless of how long they've been family for  We told her that we have invited all immediate family but not the people we don't really know and I told her it wasn't her place to decide who should and should not get an invitation to our wedding. She then began yelling at me claiming that we were treating my family better than my fianc\u00e9's and that I'd probably invited more people from my family than his (not true there are immediate members of my family who we are not inviting), she then called me an awful dil to my mil as mils partner isn't invited, as I said previously he's abusive to mil and just makes me incredibly uncomfortable.  So are we the arseholes for not inviting everyone's partners to our wedding? Edit: long term partners, fianc\u00e9's ect are invited it's just short term partners that we do not know with the exception of one that aren't invited.  This is the case for both sides of the family not just my fianc\u00e9's, as I've already seen a few comments implying that I am treating my fianc\u00e9's family different to my own, we are not and after the wedding it's one family and I'm already treating it as such. We have a budget that can accommodate 70 people, we've invited immediate family and some very close friends, we've been prioritising those who we really want to share our day with, and not put ourselves into severe debt. I don't want to not invite some family and close friends to accommodate plus ones we have never met. Edit: I realised I've only used the term plus one however every single invited has incorporated names only so everyone is a named guest and we've not give. Any plus ones plus ones I'm not sure if that will change anything however.",

He bought it so I could play my sims 4 game that I hadn\u2019t played in many months due to my laptop breaking. He and I talked about prices, (I make 1/3rd of his yearly salary).I told him I could give him $300 dollars which is what I had gotten for Christmas. As well as $200 when I got paid next (which I paid). When we went to the store he decided on a 2TB PC ($1,299) instead of the less expensive 1TB one ($849) we had originally decided on. At first I wouldn\u2019t want to play on a daily basis I had to get back into the swing of gaming again (if you game lmk if you do this too). Now I am wanting to play more often, maybe 2-4 hours daily or every other day (it\u2019s random). (Btw we bought the PC on December 28th 2024 so one month ago). My boyfriend says it\u2019s not my PC it\u2019s OUR PC which I agree. He plays every night until 1-2am, I play usually between 4pm-9pm. I have to fight with him every day on whether I play or not. The kicker is he has an Xbox which yes Is outdated but now he doesn\u2019t play it at all since he bought me the PC. \u201cThe graphics are too bad\u201d I want to mention as well, he plays call of duty on the PC with an Xbox controller. He keeps telling me to pay up if I want to be on it more I told him we agreed for me to pay what I paid and the rest was a gift. I am so appreciative for him buying this and letting me use it). Am I the asshole for thinking it should be more of my own PC to play when I\u2019d like to since it was a gift from him.  Edit :The PC\u2019s in question are :The one we decided on originally:CyberPowerPC - Gamer Master Gaming Desktop - AMD Ryzen 7 8700F - 16GB Memory - AMD Radeon RX 7600 8GB - 1TB SSD - White$849 on sale originally $949From Best Buy The one he bought is :CyberPowerPC - Gamer Master Gaming Desktop - AMD Ryzen 7 9700X - 16GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 Ti 8GB - 2TB SSD - White$1299From Best Buy as well. He also bought be a monitor that was Samsung - 27 S39C series 1000R Curved FHD FreeSync Monitor (DisplayPort, HDMI) - Black$150 on saleFrom Best Buy These are desktop pcs to be used with a monitor if you aren\u2019t familiar with this stuff.

USUALLY; I go to the gym with a gym buddy, but today I was alone. Today while I was resting between sets, the man walked up to me from across the gym and spoke, but I kept looking down on my phone and I was listening to music. He walked away after I didn\u2019t respond and did a set of hip thrusts. After finishing another set; as I was resting, the man approached me AGAIN and I tried to ignore him. He did NOT walk away this time, so I paused my music and looked up at him. The man asked me if I was missing my friend this time, and if I came to the gym everyday, and why I went to the gym so often. He then proceeded to get on the LAT RAISE machine directly across from me\u2026. I\u2019m an anxious person and very hyper aware, and I took his questions as a way to figure out whether I was alone and vulnerable and when I\u2019d be at the gym. I cut my workout short and left. I was so upset about it, I was worried he\u2019d follow me or something (he did not). I called the gym shortly after and told the staff I didn\u2019t feel comfortable and did not want him to talk to me. She apologized for me feeling uncomfortable, told me she knew exactly who I was talking about, and let me know she had no issue relaying that to him. After relaying this story to my brother who ALSO goes to this gym; I\u2019ve been told that the man could be autistic or something of the sort, thus having a lack in social cues. I understand that, but I still feel like I should be able to workout without feeling anxious or unsafe. note: I did watch him talk to other people as he made his way around the gym; I wasn\u2019t aware that it wasn\u2019t just me, so he really might just be trying to socialize and could be missing social cues. AITAH for complaining to gym staff about this guy who may have some disorder and maybe didn\u2019t intend to be creepy??? ",

Last week she had a panic attack about a bruised knee which was pretty much the only thing she talked about that day (over text). I said some nice things and wished her to feel better several times until I got overwhelmed by her anxiety. I told her that it was unbearable and that I hoped she understands if I take a step back and retain my own space in situations like this. She hasn't talked to me since. I understand that her knee hurts but I'm neither a therapist nor a doctor. AITA? Edit: To be clear, she wasn\u2019t bombing me with texts all day. It was more like, after I responded with nice words and recovery wishes and started talking about something else, she would always revert the topic back to her broken knee. She was also aware about herself being anxious, but still, after several rounds of this I got drained. This is not the first time this happened. ",

        "selftext": "I (31f) have known and been friends with my best friend (32f) for 10 years.  My fiance had proposed to me last year, and my best friend was set to be my MOH for the wedding. However, two months into the wedding preparations, I found out that my best friend had been having physical and romantic relationships with my ex-boyfriend. (The man I was dating prior to my fiance). I had dated my ex-boyfriend for about 2 years and throughout those two years she had been cheating with him. Things got a bit heated between me and her after that, but we were able to cool it down after she apologized, things were still tense, but I decided I didn't want to loose my best friend over a guy. I was still recovering from the shock of finding out what she had been doing behind my back, so I decided to demote her from MOH (and replace her with my sister). My best friend was still going to attend as a guest. She was upset at this but accepted. I thought things were good, but, last week, I found out she was talking behind my back and saying unpleasant things (she was calling me ungrateful, a biatch, mean, bratty, and other immature names). I flipped out and uninvited her from the wedding immediately. The wedding was only three weeks away at the time I uninvited her, so she said I messed up all of her plans by doing so. I do feel bad that it was so abrupt, but I didn't feel comfortable seeing her on what is supposed to be my happiest day anymore.  The wedding is on a weekend and the venue is 2hrs away from her house, so she didn't have to take a vacation to attend or anything like that, but I know cutting her out so close to the date was not the nicest move.

I frequently go through slumps of falling out of the gym and when this happens I like to start back up with YouTube\u2019s Emkfit Pilates and HIIT workouts to gain back my stamina and to get remotivated. Every time I play these videos he has always made fun of them and say they don\u2019t do anything. \u201cYou\u2019ve been doing those for years and what have they gotten you?\u201d He said to me today. Today when I got home from workout he was on the couch watching Netflix already as he came home sick from work. I got dresses in my workout clothes and he asked if I was coming to workout in the living room. I told him yes and he left to walk the dog. I was a little over half way done when he came back. He walked into the living room eating a bag of pretzels and started watching. I instantly started messing up and asked him to leave. He knows I don\u2019t like doing these videos in front of him cause I just get flustered and embarrassed. This is when he goes on a rant of how it doesn\u2019t matter and to keep going. I shut down at that point and sit down on the couch pausing the video. He eventually goes into the bedroom but only enough time to turn on the tv and walk back out within 10-15 seconds. \u201cSee I went into the bedroom and you\u2019re still not working out!\u201d Well of course not I knew you were just going to come straight back out which you did\u2026 At that point I grab my phone and go on Instagram. He starts ranting again before going back into the bedroom, and that\u2019s when he says the comment of doing these videos for years and it not doing anything for me.  He tells me I have \u201c2 minutes to start working out\u201d before he comes back.He finally stops talking and I was just going to wait enough time for the Instagram video to finish to restart the workout (wanted to wait atleast a few minutes to make sure he wasn\u2019t going to come back out). Within 1 minute he comes back out and sits on the couch. He\u2019s again going on a long rant about how I\u2019m being a child and so on and so fourth. I don\u2019t say anything, just stare at the tv until it goes into sleep mode. About 8 mins go by. He doesn\u2019t leave. Just stares at me while eating his pretzels. My cat meows from the bathroom (I put him in there to eat his wet food away from our other cat) so I turn off the tv and go to let him out. Now I\u2019m just sitting here in the bathroom typing this out.  So am I the asshole here? I can see where I was being childish, sitting on the couch and refusing to restart until he leaves. And like really leave, not go to the bedroom and continuing complaining to me and then coming straight back out. But wouldn\u2019t that also be childish on his part, refusing to do something his partner asked him to do knowing she doesn\u2019t like it?Side note: I was also getting gassy working out and didn\u2019t want to be ripping ass with him right behind me\u2026. Wasn\u2019t going to tell him that though.",

He will take out the old pod, place it into the sink without dumping out the coffee grounds, and proceed to make his fresh coffee. His reasoning for it is that he is rushing to get ready for work in the morning. I have asked him politely in the past to please dump out the coffee grounds before placing it in the sink. He has always said he would do better, but that day hasn\u2019t come. It has been months of this happening. I casually mention it a couple of times during the week and he apologizes. But today I got stern about it and expressed my frustration about it. he told me I was overreacting and that \u201cit only takes an extra 5 seconds for you to dump it out before doing dishes.\u201d Which then led us to having a petty argument.It isn\u2019t very much the coffee grounds that bother me as it is the lack of promise keeping from him.So, AITA? EDIT: I need to set a couple of things straight.1. I do not use the keurig. I don\u2019t even drink coffee, my husband is the only person who uses it2. \u201cIs this really the hill you want to die on?\u201d I know it seems small and petty. But it is more than coffee grounds. I do all of the chores. I pick up after my husband (he will leave his clothes and even socks scattered in the house). I am usually kind about these instances and I have kept my mouth shut, even though frustration was building. I have kindly asked him to pick up after himself, but I guess he is in robotic mode and just doesn\u2019t think.3. My husband is truly the love of my life, which is exactly why it frustrates me that he won\u2019t pick up after himself when he knows how I feel about it. ",

        "selftext": "I (18F) live with my dad\u2019s family, which includes his younger sister, younger brother, and his mom (my grandmother). My grandma has always been a nightmare to my mom. She constantly orders her around, making her do all the household chores\u2014cooking, receiving packages, cleaning, basically everything\u2014while never asking her own kids to do anything. On top of that, my mom is expected to think of what to cook for my grandma every day, and if she doesn\u2019t pick the perfect meal, my grandma either whines, refuses to eat, or says she\u2019s not hungry anymore. My dad works a lot, and I\u2019ve tried to tell him that his mom treats my mom like a servant, but he just neglects the issue. He doesn\u2019t outright deny it, but he acts like he doesn\u2019t see it happening. I think part of it is because my dad is the eldest son, so he has this weird soft spot for his mom. But at the same time, he\u2019s not doing anything to fix the situation, so my mom just has to deal with it. Tonight, my grandma (who is disabled) asked me to help her up the stairs. She doesn\u2019t need physical assistance, just for someone to stand behind her to make sure she doesn\u2019t tip over. I was busy, so I told my little cousin to do it instead. But honestly, even if I wasn\u2019t busy, I don\u2019t want to help someone who has treated my mom like garbage for years. My mom is physically and mentally exhausted, and it pisses me off that we have to live with my dad\u2019s family when we\u2019re not even well off financially. They\u2019re slowing us down economically, which means my mom doesn\u2019t even get to take proper breaks or vacations. It\u2019s painful to watch. After I told my cousin to help, my grandma started whining to my uncle, complaining that I \u201cpassed my responsibility\u201d onto my cousin instead of doing it myself. And this is just one example\u2014whenever we don\u2019t do exactly what she tells us to, she whines to her kids instead of actually asking them for help. Instead of telling her own children to step up, she just complains to them about how no one is listening to her, which is ironic because she never actually expects them to do anything. edit; thank you so much for the motivating words! i told my mom about this post and it made her giggle fr hahaha. i don\u2019t think she would\u2019ve expected me to write about this or for it to even reach a lot of people. thank you guys, i\u2019ll try all your suggestions and so will my mom! if we can\u2019t get out, i hope at least we can make this house a better place and less toxic. i also wish all the best to everyone, especially those in the same situation. \ud83d\udc96",

        "selftext": "Background - on a flight a few weeks ago, I was seated towards the middle of the plane, behind a very nice family. A mom traveling with her two kids. One was a baby, probably under 3 and the other was a 6 year old. Our flight had been delayed a few times while we were seated on the tarmac, the kids were getting a little restless & a young-ish woman across from them entertained them until we took off. When we got to our destination, it was around an hour or two later than the anticipated arrival time & very early in the morning (1-3 am, can\u2019t recall the exact time). Naturally, people were complaining about missing/making connected flights. The woman who had been helping the family took it upon herself to block the entire aisle until that family had gotten out of their seats and de-planed. Obviously chaos ensued. Some people *mouthed* off to the lady telling her to let them go through, people were questioning what was \u201cholding up the line\u201d among other comments. I overheard the mom (quietly) tell to the lady telling her she didn\u2019t want her to hold the line up & that they were in no hurry to get off. They were sitting down. She also said they normally waited to de-board, as it was easier with the baby. I took it upon myself to politely ask the woman if the rest of us behind her could go since the mom had said she didn\u2019t mind waiting. She turned around and *yelled* at me saying I didn\u2019t know what the mom wanted because I hadn\u2019t bonded (?) with them on the flight, and that a mom would never ask someone to hold up a line but that they\u2019d appreciate it internally, because moms are never respected by the public? I was so shocked I didn\u2019t know what to say because I\u2019d thought I was being polite & had overheard the mom saying it was fine to let everyone else go first. I just wanna know AITA in this situation? I feel like I\u2019m not but that woman yelling at me sure made me feel like I was. Edit: The mom and her kids did eventually get off but it was so awkward because the mom had clearly been prepared to wait, and all of a sudden had to get all of her stuff together and get off the plane, because of what this lady was doing for her. I feel like in that situation it would\u2019ve just been better for the lady to drop the Good Samaritan act because it was doing more harm than good?",

Forced by my parents, Emma chose medicine and I chose engineering. I was meant to do my studies abroad like Emma but because she kept failing, she had to stay back causing financial strain on my father. So my study abroad was cut short.But I graduated and secured a job asap. Got married and settled abroad. Never asked for a penny from my parents from the moment I started earning because I didn't want to pressure my father.  Emma was struggling to complete her studies. I think it is at this point she started to develop a deep sense of entitlement and resentment towards my parents and me.She finally manipulated my dad into renting her an apartment in the city so that she can study better.She would often call me to say she hasn't even eaten properly cause she doesn't have money and I'd send her money right away. Recently my family visited me.Emma visited me earlier than my parents. At this time, I was also expecting a baby. Emma acted like me being pregnant was an annoyance cause I couldn't take her around. regardless I even took her to see the city lights at mid night. My husband was concerned for my well-being and was very upset of how I was being treated.Emma would always come home saying she has no money(even though my father gave her money to spend here).she treated me like atm citing that she has done things for me (organising my wedding) so I SHOULD do everything for her and she sacrificed her youth to take care of my parents while I built my life here. After my parents came, I realised that she basically gets anything she wants from dad.I even found out that my father has given her much more money than she told me.I was upset.Even when I'm in pain,Emma very nonchalantly asks so where are we going today. That was it for me because I felt that she is treating my unborn child poorly. So I started ignoring her.I did some petty stuff like refusing to wash her clothes in the washer. Seeing this,Dad said he treated both of us equally which is not true at all because they get fancy gifts for her on her birthday but I haven't even received a card on mine for many years.   I don't think she will ever understand that me building up a life in a different country with zero family support was a sacrifice, because my father wouldn't have had the means to spend on her if he sent me money as well.   Recently I lost my beloved father. He wanted me to take care of my mum and my sister. I did speak to Emma during funeral arrangements, things have turned extremely sour.Emma is handling many of my dad's assets that I don't even know about because she wants everything for her claiming that she was the one who took care of him. So yeah, I do not talk to her and She never reached out too.I feel bad because my dad must be very unhappy. AITA?",

        "selftext": "This past weekend, I (22F) was set to have my gf (22F) over to visit. I am still living at my parent\u2019s house while I am in the process of applying to vet school while I work at the local vet. My parents had approved having my long-distance gf (we\u2019ve been together for three years, recently long-distance since I just moved) over for the weekend to visit. She got in a little after 9:30 pm this past Friday. We had dinner, chatted, and went to bed. The next morning, I had a shift at the vet from 8:30-1 so I left early. In the meantime my gf (let\u2019s call her E) hung around and chatted with my parents about the new house and how they were settling in. They ate breakfast together and had a good time.  E had mentioned that she planned to go to Costco and would be gone about 45 mins. My parents were ok with this and let her know how to use our mechanized deadbolt. She left to get me lunch and met up with a mutual friend, who we\u2019ll call L. I had asked my mother about a week ago if L could stop by and get a tour of the house. She agreed. E comes back to the house with L fully expecting me to be back home from work. I was not. I had to stay two hours late because of several emergency cases. I could not answer my phone at this time and it was around 16F outside. E brought L in to use the bathroom and play with my dog for around a half hour. Then she left and went home.  Near the end of my shift I get a text from my mom telling me to call her ASAP. I clocked out and gave her a call. She and my father began yelling at me. They saw L come in on the Ring doorbell and were furious that E \u201clied to them\u201d when they asked her what her plans were that day. When they had asked her this, she was in the middle of texting L and deciding what they were doing. I had told E it was alright that L came in because my mom had ok\u2019d it. I fully thought that I would be home to show her around. She accused E of \u201clying by omission\u201d and not telling her that she would be bringing a \u201cstranger\u201d (she and I have known L for over a year) into the house.  My dad then chimed in and said that we better be gone by the time they get home because he \u201cdidn\u2019t want to see E because he didn\u2019t know what he would say to her.\u201d (My gf heard \u201cdidn\u2019t know what he would \u2018do\u2019 so we\u2019re not really sure). This screaming and berating went on for about a half hour. They constantly blamed E when she did nothing wrong. We packed up and left. E left a handwritten note to express how sorry she was, and that she never meant to \u201clie\u201d to them.  It was all just a big misunderstanding. My mom, who usually constantly checks on me to see how I am and sends me sweet little texts is completely giving me the silent treatment. We\u2019re set to come back today but I just don\u2019t know what to do/say. I never meant to go against their wishes and I would never blatantly disrespect them like that. I apologized and told them to blame me and not my gf, but they\u2019re not budging. ",

And now my dad is getting a bunch of hate from all of my family about how I'm such an evil person for not giving my aunt money that I didn't know what she was going to use it for.. here's all that happened and why i cut contact and refuse to give her the money:  I had a house fire when I was 12, i lost my mother and brother in it,, the house that burnt down my parents didnt own that house, my aunt bought it, my parents paid rent plus all the bills, my aunt didnt get house insurance (WE THOUGHT SHE DID) so we got no money nor the Decision to keep the house up, During this time my dad was in surgery, so he was healing at the hospital  I went to go live with The aunt who had bought the house for us, That same aunt tried stealing me from my dad As in trying to get custody over me she lost, after my dad got out of the hospital we went and lived with a different aunt, we had my other other aunt start a gofund me, we raised alot of money but the aunt who started it stole most of the money from it, only giving my dad half, when we found out we moved from my other aunts house to an Apartment, we moved to a house we're I moved out, I'm in college I live in the Dormitory, So with All this being said, AITA? Edit: The reason why my dad hasn't cut ties is because he's worried it will backfire on him, and he wants our family to be able to ask him for help. the reason why my aunt came to me for money is because I was a rug (I let people walk all over me because i felt no self worth) when I was 12-18, and because I hadn't talked to her in two years she thought I'd still be easily manipulated and the same. Edit 2: My dad is telling me I either give her the money or he cuts contact with me? He's choosing his sister who stole from us rather than me, his only daughter. My older brothers are saying just cut him off and ignore him till he comes back to reality... I might have to give in on the money, I don't want to lose my dad... I don't have enough money, I'm thinking of working overtime at my job and selling some of my artwork... I'm not sure what to do.. I can't believe he's doing this because of family's family. I get that, but she's no family of mine, and I owe her nothing. Edit 3: I'm not giving in, I texted my dad telling him you need to come back to reality, your siding with a snake who stole from us after losing my mom and brother. Then I blocked him on everything.",

        "selftext": "I'm (31f) a head teacher at an academy in S.K. I taught here in 2021 & I've been back for 3 months. My 3 US coworkers all came last Aug. Unfortunately, the head teacher before me was a pushover and the other two women (Lucy 27, Cindy 23) asked that I be more assertive since John (late 30s/m) tends to steamroll everyone. In my presentation class we needed to talk about the rubric for their final projects so I needed them to really focus well. John teaches this group the hour before me. Previously he tried to bring very messy snacks to my Lit class. I asked him to please not take snacks to any teachers classes unless you've spoken to them about it. Today he made a bag of popcorn and started putting it in little bowls. Before I went to class I asked him you're not planning on bringing that to my class are you? And he replied with no I'm not. 10min in class the door opens, here he comes with popcorn and the kids go nuts. I tell them no and I follow John back to the door. I say I just asked you if you were bringing it to the class and you said no but you did it anyways. That's so disrespectful. It took a couple min to settle the kids but they didnt grumble about it after I said they can have the snack after class. Class is over, John is out in the hallway giving the kids popcorn and I go to the teachers office. I say to my coworker Lucy, I can't believe he still tried to bring them popcorn when I asked him if he was and he said no to which she responded and why can't they have a snack??. I said first of all, there are signs in all the classrooms that say no eating during class and second, I said no because I needed them to focus on lesson and that should be reason enough. When John came back in the office I asked to speak privately. I told him that it was disrespectful for him to bring snacks when I had already asked if he was and he had said no. His response was I told you no because that bag had gotten kind of burnt and I wanted to make more. I thought you were only asking if I was taking THAT bag of popcorn. I was lowkey floored? We talked 2 weeks ago about not bringing food to classes without asking first and why would I mean that one specific bag of popcorn? He started yelling about how he was just trying to do something nice. I explained to him that I understand that he is doing something kind for the students but he's also not the king of the academy and he can't come into classes in the middle of lesson without asking first. There was a little more back and forth but by the end he said he understood. Now I'm still thinking about it. It was literally just popcorn but it just feels like the principle of the matter? I feel like maybe ITA because I didn't directly say do not bring them snacks because I need to go over really important material at the start of class but usually we finish early so it's okay at the end of class. Lucy's reaction is also making me feel like I over did it.",

        "selftext": "I've been a long-time lurker and this is my first post, none of my other friends understand my situation (they got assigned single rooms) so I'm hoping to get a nuanced answer from Reddit. So I (19) share a room with Sara (19) in our college dorm. By sharing a room, I mean we live in a 12ft x 18ft room with two beds on either side. it's a co-ed floor, tho the rooms itself are single gender and there are separate washrooms/showers for men and women. We're allowed to have guests stay over, up to 3 nights a month so as long our roommate is ok with it.  Once a week for the past couple months my roommate's bf has been driving over to hang out with her once a week. This is fine, i didn't mind at first because they would go on cute dates outside but now it's getting super uncomfortable for me. So now that it's cold outside they're just in the room watching movies and hanging out all day. This means I have to either sit there awkwardly (which is unpleasant and awkward for the both of us) or I have to leave and find somewhere to go. Sara's never kicked me out but I can tell she would prefer if I left and it's uncomfortable for me to stay anyways.  Last Friday, I decided to talk to her and asked her what she and her boyfriend were doing the next morning and she said they were going to watch a movie and stay in. At this I asked her if she could go somewhere else with him. She seemed really confused and I explained to her that I felt kind of awkward being a third wheel and like i was intruding on them (they're super PDA as well). Sara got really mad and said that her half of the dorm was hers and she could do as she liked with it. I didnt know what more to say so I ended the convo. Her boyfriend came over yesterday and I think she told him I didn't like him there because he looked really awkward and I just ended up leaving. i also heard Sara on the phone to him in the hallway and she was joking about how I was probably in love with him and/or jealous of her. Now I feel kinda shitty and I'm regretting saying anything. What is dorm etiquette? Am I missing something?",

        "selftext": "My sister (34F) and I (32F) have a complicated relationship due to our narcissistic mother, but we\u2019ve bonded in adulthood. We both have ADHD and mental health struggles. Eve doesn\u2019t really have close friends besides me, whereas I\u2019ve built a small but solid circle since meeting my fianc\u00e9 in 2017. We\u2019re having a relaxed weekend wedding at holiday cottages (\u00a3190pp). My maid of honour and I fell out this year due to her being in an abusive relationship. Eve never liked her and quickly offered to take over planning my hen do. I was grateful but worried, as she isn\u2019t the most organised. Originally, my MOH planned a weekend away (\u00a3300+), which Eve criticised as too expensive. So I was surprised when she arranged a trip to Amsterdam for \u00a3350pp. She assured me eight were coming and 20 for a local hen do. I trusted her. Time passed, and I had to chase her for details. She said it would be booked on Jan 17th but didn\u2019t mention that everyone dropped out due to cost\u2014leaving just me, her, and one bridesmaid. When the 17th came and nothing was booked, I asked what was going on. She admitted it was just us three, and I said not to bother with Amsterdam. She got defensive, saying she couldn\u2019t force people to come. I never expected that\u2014I just expected her to make it affordable, which she didn\u2019t. After criticising my MOH for cost, she planned something even more expensive. I know Amsterdam is somewhere she\u2019s always wanted to go, and I feel like my hen do became more about that than what I wanted. She accused me of caring more about quantity than quality, which wasn\u2019t true at all. It wasn\u2019t about numbers\u2014it was about having my friends there, which she completely overlooked. She left the hen chat and blocked me on WhatsApp. A few days later, I heard she was struggling with her daughter, so I tried to reach out. She ignored my calls, and when I finally got through via iMessage, she said she didn\u2019t want to speak to me because I\u2019d called the hen do a car crash (which\u2026 it kind of was, considering some girls didn\u2019t even know about Amsterdam). Since then, I\u2019ve planned my own hen do\u201412 of us are going to a cottage with a hot tub for \u00a3140pp. I didn\u2019t want to fall out, so I had a bridesmaid add her back into the chat to see the new plans. She left immediately. I texted her, asking if she was coming to the hen do or wedding, since she still hasn\u2019t paid for her accommodation (due in December). No response. Now I don\u2019t know what to do. I haven\u2019t lashed out or been cruel, and I don\u2019t feel like I deserve this treatment. People keep telling me to reach out again, but I already tried. I don\u2019t see why I should keep bending over backwards when she\u2019s the one who blocked me. I need to decide whether to tell the venue we have two fewer guests. If I don\u2019t, I\u2019m stuck paying for her and my niece. If I do, then this argument might be the final straw for our relationship.",

        "selftext": "Hi All, My dad calls me often when he\u2019s been drinking or high. When I see his number, I know what it ultimately is for - money. Context, I grew up in a large family and my dad was rarely in my life. He and my mom were constantly fighting; he would beat her and we would need to move to get away from him. He always found his way back to us. He wasn\u2019t a great father figure. He didn\u2019t provide for us and neither could my mom. So, we grew up poor.  I never really liked him. I thought of him as a terrible father and human being, but as he\u2019s gotten older, he\u2019s softer and I am at the age where I get to see his personality. Maybe it\u2019s because he\u2019s in his 60s and I\u2019m in my 40s that we can have the relationship we have. You see, I don\u2019t have the energy to argue with him, and he\u2019s too old to be petty (like he used to be). So, our conversations are about life and what to look out for as you get older. He tries to go down memory lane, but I hate it because he\u2019s only able to talk about the years when I was in grade school (ages 0 - 10). He\u2019s picked up on it and doesn\u2019t bring up the past as much. Anyway, I\u2019m an engineer and I make a great living. My wife is a professional in health care and she earns a great living, too. Together we make $46k per month. I would say we\u2019re a middle class family with a middle class lifestyle. Why is this important? Because when my dad calls, he always asks for money. The money isn\u2019t a lot. It is usually $100 dollars. He calls every other day. Now I hate giving him money because 1) it feels like he use me as an ATM 2) he takes the money to go buy drugs and alcohol and 3) I have a feeling the asks are going to get larger. He\u2019s always talking about moving in my home (he says it\u2019s a joke, but I know it\u2019s not).  One day while we were on the phone he said, \u201cSend me $100 since I know you have it\u201d, and I said \u201cI\u2019m not going to send you any more money\u201d. He then tells me \u201cI know you\u2019re going to send it because you always do\u201d. Now, he\u2019s right because even though I say I\u2019m not, I\u2019ll still cash app him the money. I\u2019m upset with his presumption about what I\u2019ll do. This has irritated me so much so that I\u2019ve stop answering his calls the last few days. When I went over our expenses for the year (this is only because we\u2019re preparing our taxes), I noticed that I\u2019ve given him close to $20k for the year. Again, it doesn\u2019t harm our finances, but $20k is a lot of money.  AITA for cutting him off and no longer taking his calls and sending him money? ",

        "selftext": "Husband found a neighborhood dive bar with a pool table.  I don't drink much, but I like pool and we haven't gone to play for a long time.  I'm not good at it.  But it's fun.  So he hints around that he wants to go out, and after some back and forth he asks if I want to go to the bar. (Honestly at first it seemed like he didn't want me to go, and I was okay with staying home.). Anyway, I agree and we head out.  It's not far away and I even commented that I could be designated driver. For some reason that seemed to make him uncomfortable, but he brushed it off and off we went.  So I order my one drink, he gets his beer and some quarters and we play some pool.   Somewhere around the second game, an older guy at the bar starts critiquing my game, telling me which ball to shoot for, etc.  By the time we're into the third game and he's making his helpful suggestions, I stop and ask him (verbatim) excuse me, if you were playing, would you like someone to tell you how to play?. He took a second, said no, but you're bad at it.  I said I know, and took my shot.  Pretty tame?  At least I thought so.  Husband asks what I said to the guy so I told him... And he was upset!  Said I shouldn't have been rude.  We finished that game, I lost again and he wanted to leave.  He said I was rude, the guy was drunk and I should have ignored him.  That we were there to spend time with each other not get into a bar fight.  I said I was sticking up for myself and I think it's despicable that he'd be mad at me for that.  That I don't need him to stand up for me, and nobody was having a bar fight... But taking a strangers side over mine, calling me RUDE (I don't think I was rude) and really picking a fight with me makes him TA.   What do you think internet strangers? ",

        "selftext": "Four years ago I [37M] left my career to help my brother [38] and his wife build their business.  I was promised raises that never materialized.  I worked harder than either of them and everyone understood it.  The business grew rapidly and as they did well my salary stagnated and I was seldom acknowledged.  A lack of ethics was a constant problem that we disagreed over often.  It came to a head when I refused to lie for them to an important employee on my staff.  They had promised him something they had no intention of fulfilling.  I was suspended and forced to resign so that I\u2019d be entitled to no severance or unemployment. I didn\u2019t fight this.   When I quit my brother told me that I was allowed to go into any business other than the same type of business we were in together.  He said that if I started a similar business this would violate the spirit of our fraternal bond and would be seen as a hostile act. He maintained that it\u2019s inappropriate to compete against family members.  Our market is vast and there\u2019s plenty of room for new companies.  I offered him a non compete agreement protecting his geographical region and precluding myself from using any of my existing contacts.  I thought this seemed fair but he rejected it saying that any entry into the market on my part would not be acceptable.   Am I the asshole for starting a similar business?  Would I be the asshole for going directly after his clients now that he has rejected my offer?  ",

I was looking for something quick to eat at home and saw it in the freezer. Figured she wasn\u2019t going to eat it since it had been 2 weeks at that point so I baked it and ate it over a couple days. Today she looks in the freezer and asks where her pizza is. I told her I ate it cuz it had been there for a while and I didn\u2019t feel like going to the store last weekend. She called me a big back and an asshole. Said that she would have never eaten mine (when I cooked mine was the same day I bought hers and she took half of it when I had it cooling on the stove) and that I would be just as upset. And yeah. Like maybe 8 years ago I would have been upset if I had bought myself something and someone had taken it, but I haven\u2019t done that since we first got together nearly a decade ago. She is literally ignoring me now over a frozen pizza. I even got her a new one at the store and she is refusing it. I just think the whole thing is ridiculous.

        "selftext": "So i (15f) have a best friend (also 15f), who got a moped last summer, after turning 15. We had fun summer riding it together and going to places and so on. One day she sends me a message telling me how her dog had peed on her helmet, because she had left it on the floor. She comes to pick me up from my house the same day and complained, how the helmet is ruined, and how it still smells like dog pee even after she had washed it. After she had picked me up, we decided to go to her place. After the whole day of complaining about the helmet, she told me that her parents went to get her a new one. I was a bit shocked, because the helmet did cost a 150$ and they didint really try that hard to get the smell out. Then she told me that she was just gonna throw the old helmet away, so i asked her if i could have it, since my helmet is old and pretty scratched and i tought that i could atleast try to get the smell off of it. She told me that i could have it and !keep in mind that i asked if she wants any money for it and she said no! She even asked her mother if it would be okay and her mom also said yes. I asked her few times if she is 100% sure that she wants to give it to me and that she doesn\u00b4t want any money for it, and she kept saying yes. I was very happy that i finally had a new helmet and when i got home i immediately washed the helmet twice and also left it to my balcony for a week just to get the smell out of it. Finally it worked. I completely got the smell off the helmet. The next day when me and my best friend were hanging out again, i told her that i got the smell out of it. for my suprise she wasn\u00b4t happy for me. Infact she actually asked it back. She said that it is still hers and that she actually wants to sell it now. I was really shocked and i refused to give it back to her, because she had gave it to me. I told her that i could have gave her some money for it, but she didn\u00b4t want it. She just kept on saying that i should give it back, because she wants to sell it and that it is still her helmet and stuff like that. I still refused, because i was the one who got the smell off of it and kept pointing out the fact that she had gave it to me. We have had couple of small arguments about this even after summer and now i really just need someone elses opinion. So please tell me Am i the asshole? P.s Im sorry if there is a lot of mistakes. English is not my first language.   UPDATE:  So thank you to everyone who has told me some good ideas what to do. Today i started talking to my friend about the helmet again. I wanted to see how she reacts and what she woud say, so i just said something like i will buy new glasses to wear with the helmet you gave to me. After saying that she said no i will take it back. We had an argument again and i told her that she literally gave it to me and that im the one who cleaned it. She then said that she could give me like 20$ for it, but that it wasn\u00b4t a gift and that after she had gave it to me her mom had said that she could have sold it. I told her that she had literally given it to me. So it basically was a gift. After this argument we both were kind of giving eachother silent treatment while we were walking back to her house. We had made plans earlier this week that we would go to the gym after school and we had been talking about it even at school. Suddently when we are walking to her house to get her gym clothes, she suddently says im tired so i won\u00b4t come to the gym. I was really pissed because an hour ago she was not too tired to go. I was getting really annoyed so i said fuck you and turned around.  And for everyone saying that if i give it back i should pee in it first, i definetly will. The first thing i will do is just not talk about it and if she mentions it i will just keep telling her no.' If that doesn\u00b4t work i will pee in it or make my dog pee in it and then give it back.  Thank you everyone who has responded to this!! ",

        "selftext": "My cousin S and I were incredibly close since childhood, despite our five-year age gap. We were confidants\u2014or so I thought. Last July, S started dating A, and their relationship accelerated rapidly. A, recovering from a difficult breakup, seemed like a breath of fresh air. They decided to marry just 4-5 months into their relationship. Her parents initially opposed the match. I supported S, believing A was a good person. I even argued with her parents, and my mother\u2014S's aunt\u2014also fought for her within the family. S had lived with us for over a year during her studies, during a time of significant financial hardship. My mother showed her extraordinary care, arguably more than she demonstrated towards her own children. After months of drama, her parents finally blessed the marriage. Then, S dramatically changed. She became self-absorbed, obsessing over her wedding while excluding everyone. It felt like she used our family to get what she wanted and then discarded us. During this period, two young family members passed away. In our culture, such losses typically mean avoiding celebrations for a year. S showed no emotional response and set her wedding date merely 8-9 months after their deaths\u2014an action many found extremely insensitive. Her behavior grew increasingly hurtful. She got engaged without inviting me or my mother, claiming it was a surprise\u2014despite numerous relatives and friends being present. She visited my city multiple times, deliberately avoiding including me. She scheduled her wedding the day before my brother's critical board exams, knowing he would need my study support. Her communication became manipulative. She'd send lengthy midnight messages portraying herself as struggling and lonely, repeatedly asking if I was upset. She changed her bachelorette venue last minute, ensuring I couldn't attend, and instead went out with friends. These actions made me feel she was more interested in maintaining a facade of closeness than genuinely being present in our relationship. Considering these circumstances, I've decided to skip her wedding. In Indian wedding culture, RSVP isn't standard, so I plan to make a last-minute excuse. Am I the asshole?",

I talked to my parents and they said he needs to go in and see a doctor because if it\u2019s strep it could spread to his heart or kidneys, so i told him we need to go to urgent care and get tested. his family is lower income so i offered to pay for all expenses his mom was against going to the doctor (i didn\u2019t know) she wanted him to just take Tylenol and rest, I pushed for the doctor and he left without telling his mom, he picked me up and we went to urgent care we checked in I talked to the nurse she said we needed parental consent before they did any test (I had called before hand and asked if a minor could come in for a testing and they said nothing about parental consent for anything) so Ashton called his mom and handed me the phone since he can\u2019t speak so I asked his mom if she could give consent for the strep test she hung up on me as soon as I asked, so we called his dad next no answer. The nurse told us we should go to the ER because they don\u2019t need parental consent and she was worried because of how swollen his throat is. we left and he took me home and then he went home. his mom told him that \u201cif you dont respect me then you can pack your shit and live with her\u201d her being me. I understand his mom being upset with him leaving and going to urgent care with me and then just getting a call asking for consent on a test but at the same time it\u2019s her son and she should put his health over everything and now i just feel like she hates me and i don\u2019t know what to do to make things better. My dad texted Ashton and told him we would take him to the ER right now and Ashton said no because he would get kicked out of the house if he went so we offered to take him tomorrow while his mom is at work and he told me he doesn\u2019t want to go behind her back which I understand but i\u2019m very worried for his health and i just want him to feel better i\u2019ve spent the last two nights with him taking care of him and I know how much pain he\u2019s in I just don\u2019t know what else to do or how else to respond to this situation.   UPDATE: (his mom not wanting him to go in is not for any religious reasons)  His mom said she would take him this weekend if he doesn\u2019t get better but i am worried that it will be too long and things could get seriously dangerous for him i can\u2019t even see the back of his throat when i check.

        "selftext": "I 40 yo female and my husband 41 yo male have a constant battle over the temperature of the house during the winter heating season. I would ideally keep the house 65-70F unless it is super cold outside in which case I might go as high as 72-74F. The higher temp would be a rare exception for me. I do typically like to be cooler overall and wear fewer layers and lighter fabrics. He prefers to be warmer overall but wants to be able to lounge around the house in a t-shirt and sleep shorts when he is in for the evening. He rather adamantly insists that he is the sole controller of the thermostat of which there is only one for the whole house. He says growing up that he never had any choice in the temperature of his home and that as an adult he will always have the choice and control. This means that the thermostat has a locked out range of 72-80F and he typically maintains it at 77-79F and is \u201ccomfortable.\u201d He will occasionally make changes when I tell him how miserably uncomfortable I am at that temperature but his concession is typically only a couple of degrees to perhaps 76F.  He feels that my perception of it being too hot is entirely hormonal/physiologic and that I am being ridiculous with my complaints. He regularly asks me if I am menopausal or pre menopausal. I acknowledge that I take many medications following treatment for cancer a couple of years ago and do have a heat intolerance but the intolerance doesn\u2019t MAKE me hot nor do I ask for an unreasonable temperature correction. We are both overweight and actively working to lose weight. So I don\u2019t feel that that is as much of a factor as we both have that variable at play. I can only take so many clothes off but he doesn\u2019t feel he should be expected to wear additional clothing or use a blanket.  I am really struggling to not feel devalued in the choice to keep the house so hot. I will get so hot while cooking to the point that I need to open the windows and he gets very upset at that but at 79F the furnace runs constantly any way so the windows are only making me more comfortable in a hot space and not wasting energy/costing extra.  Am I being unreasonable/petty in my ask? AITA for opening the windows or am I justified in this frustration. For reference during the summer he will run the AC once the outside temp is hitting the 80\u2019s and will keep it at around 72-74F which is typically ok to warm for me but I can usually deal with that pretty well because at least it is cool air.  When he is away for at least several hours I turn the heat down as low as the settings allow or shut it off just for a break. This is the only time I adjust the thermostat. ",

I have been dating my girlfriend for just over two years. However, prior to meeting my girlfriend, I was married/dating to my ex for almost 10 years. We were high school sweethearts, but ended up divorcing about 4 years ago. The divorce wasn\u2019t bad, but it was a divorce so it wasn\u2019t easy by any means. Anyways, my ex and I were back in my hometown about three weeks ago to visit family, as we weren\u2019t able to be home for Christmas. Naturally I took her around town, met some of my old buddies, and we ended up at the local brewery. We were there talking and having a good time, when I noticed my ex at a table with her new husband at a table on the other side of the brewery. We made eye contact, so I simply smiled and lifted my beer in a \u201ccheers\u201d motion to her, and she did the same. I never left my seat or even thought about it. My girlfriend saw me do this, and noticed who it was too, and kept talking to my buddies. Didn\u2019t think anything of it. Well we got home that evening and I got torn a new one\u2026how dare I do that in front of her and disrespect her. I responded that it was simply acknowledging her and nothing more! That didn\u2019t seem to help my case, so I was told to sleep in the spare bedroom. My buddies are split, with some telling me that my girlfriend is way overreacting, but others saying I\u2019m an idiot for doing what I did.

        "selftext": "My husband (M36) and I (F32) have an 18-month-old daughter and a son on the way.  I'm a good wife and easy-going. I've been the breadwinner our entire relationship. I make $250K and pay the majority of our bills. I keep myself in amazing physical shape, work out daily, and still have visible abs 22 weeks into my second pregnancy. I also handle the household responsibilities (cooking/cleaning) and 99% of the childcare (my husband has fed our daughter maybe 2 meals and given her as many baths in her short little life.)  Husband had promised me he was going to make dinner last night. This was a very rare thing and I was excited for it. He calls me 3 hours before he's due home asking if I'd mind if he cooked tomorrow instead so he can go to his buddy's after work. This particular friend is an unmarried and childless pothead which is fine, no judgment. But every time my husband comes back from hanging out with him he is stoned out of his mind. I accept his weed use and don't complain about it (except when he does it in the house because we have a toddler and I'm pregnant) but he comes home half dead after these hang outs.  I honestly tell him I was looking forward to dinner so I'm disappointed and wish I had known earlier but of course he can go.  He gets home around 7 and I wasn't exactly thrilled to see him. We wake up this morning and he tells me he feels unloved and that it's a huge problem that I'm passive aggressive any time he wants to hang out with his friends. To be fair, this is kind of true. We lived in downtown Chicago when we met and I gave up my entire life to move to the middle of nowhere to be by his family. He has tons of friends here and despite my best efforts I only have 1. So I'm lonely, and I miss my old life at times. I told him that he can't expect me to be elated to have him come home all stoned when I have to be sober/pregnant and doing the majority of the household tasks. I told him he could work on catering to me more during pregnancy (I often ask for back rubs and he has never once given me one.)  He freaked out on me, told me this isn't transactional, told me I'm annoying to ask for back rubs and to give it a rest, and then to add insult to injury said my job was easy. Which is funny because if it's so easy it would be great for him to go out and earn the same money that I make as he makes less than half of what I do and I'm real tired of being the provider and the homemaker.   Anyway, this is when I tell him that grown men with kids do not go get stoned with their buddies after work. They come home and be with their families.  Apparently this was so egregious he left for the day without saying goodbye. He acts like I prevent him from having any friends which isn't true. I always encourage him to see his friends and go on trips and on and on. But I will admit that I can be passive aggressive about it just because I don't ever get to do the same kinds of things.  I am so curious to know, AITA? ",

Problem is, it was cancelled by the government early last year. I know because I was in the program! I've told him this every time he's brought it up, starting out gentle and with something like maybe you should look up options, I'm sure there's something.  And then it repeats. Last night I told him he should message a friend with my phone that he'll be late because his phone was off and she'll think he ditched her. He says Noooo, I would never ditch her, she knows that! (He's literally slept through a dinner we were supposed to have before he left the state so I didn't believe him tbh).  He gets home, internet connects to phone, and boom, flood of messages, I was right.

He didn't seem bothered, kinda half joked it off. We keep talking and he brings up the ACP again. I honestly feel gaslit at this point especially because he says I really need to sign up for that and *I think you qualify*I very frustratedly told him pretty much what I typed up. That I've told you about this like five times before, that I was on it, the Internet company barely wanted to follow it anyway, and that the program was cancelled. Lady's and gentlemen, he brushed me off.  So I got frustrated and just googled it and read him the Wikipedia article. The acp program ran out of funding in April 2024. Etc.. yada yada...  He basically broke and said So I'm just screwed?!?. I said I w tried to tell you this before and you didn't listen to me. The rest of the phonecall he kept saying what?? It felt like anytime I talked so I got frustrated and hung up since he just said he was about to go to bed anyway. Definitely a bitch move. He won't respond this morning. So I'm TA for the end I think, but was there a better way to handle the rest?",

        "selftext": "I have no clue how to start this so here we go, I am 27 years old, work seasonally at a beach club/music festival around the US as a bartender/server. When I was around 13-14 my aunt with two disabled children(who are now 21)asked if I would be willing to take a job with the agency she goes through for the children's benefits The deal she explained to me was she would put the hours in and collect the checks at the end of the week but come tax season I would make out great with taxes. unfortunately, at the time my mother was in the midst of her addiction and wasn't there to explain the consequences of what this could bring, at 13 I agreed to what my aunt was asking, not fully aware of what it meant. I tried filing the taxes probably three times with the w2s from both of the children and ended up owing or getting nothing back because I was working when she was claiming I worked for her as well. when I was 21, I demanded that she stop claiming wages in my name. she told me she had done so and stopped, again I owed on taxes. so, to my knowledge for the past 6 years she was not claiming wages in my name after I said stop like I said before my work is seasonal for the most part with bartending festivals and the beach club only being open summer-late fall, HR suggested to file unemployment since they had to push our reopen date back a month. when I applied for unemployment the woman, I was speaking to informed me that I had wages in another state from my aunt's children, my wages in all states will be looked at and sent to me for review that was three days ago. that paperwork came in two days ago it showed within the last year my aunt has claimed $61,568 in my name. I immediately contacted her through text (I have been refusing to speak on the phone in case I need messages documented) and begged to know why she didn't stop when I asked her 6 years ago to stop since those wages potentially made me ineligible for unemployment, I did find out today that I will be getting unemployment based off those wages as well. the woman I spoke to said I'd be getting more for unemployment because of those wages. Since she has been claiming that amount for that long in my name plus, I haven't filed the taxes because I had no idea that she was still doing it. she did say again she would stop but she didn't last time. My mother is freaking out on my aunt. my 80-year-old grandfather has called to see what is going on and I was honest with him but he's just trying to do damage control so no one will report my aunt. I don't want her to get arrested, but I cannot pay the taxes that are owed. she has reached out and told me to do the taxes and she will take care of them. but the point is she should have never kept going to begin with, I agreed and said I wouldn't be paying the taxes she would as soon as I find out how much they are, as well id appreciate financial help since she's been doing this to me for years. AITA for calling her out and expecting her to make it right",

        "selftext": "Hello all! I am seriously wondering whether or not I am the AITA! Some background, I (21 f) held my birthday party this weekend! I invited quite some people and it was quite fun! A friend of mine (30 m) was also invited, I would like to add that he was already on quite some thin ice, to make it simple I will refer to him as Bob We share 2 mutuals friends (21 f) and (25 m) to make it simple I will refer to them as Lynn, and Jeff. We used to be quite close all three, having Lynn move into my appartment complex made us only closer, unfortunately Bob decided to make a new groupchat purely to not include me. When confronted he denied of the existence, which upset Lynn due to us being really close and just not liking it at all. Despite all this Bob was still invited to my party, because I didn\u2019t want to make this \u201cbigger\u201d then it was. I rented a location for my birthday, which due to the rain became quite muddy outside and had a lot of gaps in the ground, it was also really dark outside He decided without communicating to me, that he would do a photoshoot on that terrain with some people I also invited, I simply asked them why because a birthday party doesn\u2019t seem like the time nor place to do a photoshoot imo. I wouldn\u2019t mind people taking pictures at all, with phones since I understand taking selfies/videos! But he took all his camera equipment with him, including lights without any communication. I as a photographer myself, would never take my equipment with me, at a private event like birthday parties unless the host asked. Or unless I asked for permission and it was fine My boyfriend kindly asked him to stop, because it was just weird to just shoot on a birthday party without any proper notice. Eventually he came back into the party, looking all upset for the last 3 hours, and just keeping looking at his phone which was just very awkward for all the guests being there. When asked about it by others he kept claiming he was getting \u201ckicked out\u201d which mind you he only got kindly asked to stop, due to the terrain being dangerous etc etc Eventually he left without saying goodbye, or honesty anything I kindly messaged him, because stuff like this wouldn\u2019t have happened if there was any communication. He claimed that \u201che was an adult so he didn\u2019t need to ask for permission, and that he was done getting told what he could do and not\u201d He ended up blocking me and Lynn on everything because he was upset, later I however also find out that he was bragging to my guests about going on a date with a 19 year old, so I don\u2019t know whether I dodged a bullet, or whether I am truly in the wrong.",

        "selftext": " So me and my sister, we get along pretty well. We spend every day together and my mum is also at home every day when she isn't working. My sister HATES sharing. She refuses to share when told or she will give me something if she feels like it and is in a good mood.  I, on the other hand, will share quite regularly and when told (I'll get to that, it's quite important) and she sort of apprectiates it. If i offer her a bite of my food she'll eat like half of it but I don't mind. I'll only tell her absolutely no if it's something special or something I really want.  Now my mum. My sister has a very demanding personality and my mum is more gentle. That leads to my sister being dominating of my mum so she gets what she wants a lot. My mum enables that, so when I tell her no to having, say, one of my chocolates, my mum will force me to give my sister what she wants.  Now, today. So I got a present from my sister, it was a Sanrio mystery bag with sparkly tickers. I like Sanrio so I loved it and I decorated my laptop with them, leaving about 8 or 9 stickers left. My sister wanted some but I said no she can just buy some, I don't see why she needs mine. She's been asking non stop for just one sticker but I said no. Tonight, she asked again for stickers so I said, rather frustrated, no Im not giving you a sticker, stop asking me constantly. I said it in a rude way because she has been asking me constantly for more than 2 months. My mum and sister were staring at me with disgust and my mum said are you even Christian anymore? Jesus says to share. She always brings religion into these things so I said yes mum I am, just because I'm not giving her my stuff doesn't mean I'm not Christian.  My sister ended up calling me names and saying I was immature so I said is it mature to not respect no for nearly 2 months?. My mum started getting angry and called me a f**khead turd selfish b***ch and told me that she wouldn't be taking me anywhere. I told her that was manipulative and she responded with I don't give a flying f**k. It went on for a bit longer and yes I was being rude because im sick of it, my sister gets what she wants all the time and she caused this huge drama over one sticker.  Then my sister came in again saying you're nearly 18, you caused all this over a sticker, you're being so rude for nothing. I got annoyed and said you're nearly 16, you won't respect no. I've been repeating over and over. I told her she's been harassing me and I'm sick of it. She keeps saying I only asked you once so I say no, you've asked multiple times over 2 months but then she responds with I meant tonight and it's really annoying that she asking me more than once when I already said no.  My dad is on my side and told them both it doesn't matter, it's her stickers so why should she have to give it to (my sister) but they both keep saying oh she was so rude but my dad sees why I'm so annoyed.  Anyway idk what to do or if I'm wrong,  AITA?",

I needed a place for my bed to go and his sister needed a bed- we were going to use his bed because his bed is the biggest. She would sleep on the floor or an air mattress at her moms house, which I thought was kind of sad. My boyfriend atm, said he would buy her one but we were both short on money (Teens moving into a new apartment yk) so I figured he could buy her one some other time and she could just use mine.  Well\u2026 we\u2019re approaching the end of our lease. My boyfriend is now my ex boyfriend and I need my bed.  Turns out his sister let her cats pee all over my bed, she got red juice all over the mattress, and the plastic I had over the mattress well she apparently took that off, along with the mattress cover. The bed is ruined, my ex said it, she said it, her mom said.  She said that she would buy me a new one. Turns out she meant a cheap $100 mattress from Walmart. Mind you I got mine from Levin and it\u2019s a Sealy mattress- think 500+ I know I should have considered a bit more when I let her borrow it, but at the moment it worked out for both of us, and who would assume a 18/19 can\u2019t take care of a bed when I did it myself??  She said, \u201cI\u2019m ngl Ik I did mess up the bed and i should\u2019ve taken better care of it but I\u2019m not spending 500 on a bed when there are better beds you can get for way less.\u201d  Her words^ so\u2026 AITA for expecting her to replace the mattress she ruined?!

        "selftext": "My family has a big reunion every spring, and it's always been a huge deal because it's the one time everyone flies in from across the country. We meet up at my grandparents' old ranch, roast marshmallows, and catch up on everything going on in our lives. It's been going on for about 20 years, and my parents expect me (25f) to be there every single year without fail.  But my best friend Jenny (26f) suddenly announced she's getting married in two months. Her fianc\u00e9 got a great job offer overseas, so they moved up the wedding before they relocate. The only date available at their venue is the exact same weekend as my family reunion. Jenny asked me to be a bridesmaid, which we've literally talked about doing for each other since we were little kids, so I immediately said yes. I didn\u2019t even think about how my family would react.  When I told my parents and siblings I\u2019d miss the reunion, they got really upset. My dad said he only sees certain relatives once a year at this event. My mom said I was basically ruining the family tradition. Then my older brother called me selfish and warned I'd regret missing these moments when our parents are gone one day. But this wedding really matters to me, and I know Jenny would be crushed if I wasn't there with her.  I even offered to go to part of the reunion before flying out for the wedding, but my brother said there was no point in doing that for just one day and told me I had to pick family over everything else. I hate the drama, but I also don\u2019t feel right abandoning Jenny when this is such an important (and last-minute) thing.  So, am I the asshole for skipping my family reunion to be in my best friend\u2019s wedding?",

However one thing is that she has a really, shall we say, aggressive side to her.  She does a lot of things to me like calling me stupid, a bitch or other names. She loves telling me to shut up. It doesn\u2019t bother me because she's worth it and she\u2019s not always like that. Sometimes tho, she straight up threatens me and blocks me for the tiniest things. I really love talking to her so it really hurts me, but sometimes I think I deserve it tbh. Anyway, now for where it all went wrong. Two days ago, she told me to apologise for absolutely no reason. I already had such a hard long day and then on top of that whatever apologies I gave, never seemed good enough. She kept telling me to redo it and be sincere about it. She said don't repeat the same thing over and over again and no copying and pasting, every letter needed to be typed. I told her I couldn\u2019t write that many sincere apologies but she kept insisting. And then it happened. I ended up calling her a cow. The intention was to use as a reason to apologise which is exactly what she wanted from me. I said it to her and then instantly apologised. At first she seemingly found it funny which was my intention, but then all of a sudden, she said that was her last straw and then proceeded to block me.  I was confused but then the guilt set in. I felt really bad about it, that I hurt her feelings. Maybe I went too far? I thought it was just a harmless funny joke. Tbh I don\u2019t really know where the line is drawn, as she insults me relentlessly yet I never do it. I think I may have really upset her this time. Am I the asshole?",

They have 2 cats that the only thing they do for them is feed them. They both constantly order stuff from Amazon and just throw the boxes into the dining room. I'm talking massive pile the size of a large suv. They occasionally clean, vacuum, dishes, etc. Things that I consider to be at a minimum weekly. The house wreaks of cat piss and mold.  I had a career that left me a bit physically broken. I can still manage day to day stuff but being in a car more than 2 hours really begins to aggravate old injuries. They know this and still want me to go up there to do something like take the trash out and all the other chores.  Here's where I am really having difficulty. My younger brother did live with them and somewhat help with these tasks. I say somewhat because he was an alcoholic and I say was because he died because of it. He was completely dependent on my parents to take him and pay for his alcohol. I didn't know how bad it truly was until he ended up in the hospital and the doctors said he would only have days to live. It ended up only being 1 day and I got there about an hour after he died. I know addiction is a hell of thing to deal with and also know that he ultimately made the choice to drink the way he did. I cannot seem to get the feeling that my parents are at least partly to blame for his death.  Every time I leave that house I feel completely emotionally drained.

        "selftext": "Okay sooo first of all here's some necessary info about this. I'm 15f, freshman in a boarding high school. I share a dorm with two roommates, one which I'm gonna call M and the other one S. We're all the same year. I have ARFID and am anemic, which causes me to be often low on energy.  Sooo like the title says, I'm not going to eat with her. M is always begging me to go and eat (or just wait) there for like 15 minutes. We have three meals every day, breakfast before our school (which starts at 7:30 most of the time), lunch which is like riiight after school, and the dinner which is at 18:00. Usually, S goes with her, but she also has other friends so she often ends up not going with M. I do sometimes go with her, but it's just awkward because I can't really eat most of the things there because of my eating disorder, so I just take the tiny yoghurt and wait there while she or they're eating.  Most of the time when M asks me to go with her, I say no. I just don't have the energy to get ready and go be around people for 20 minutes while she's eating. She keeps asking maany many times,  and my answer is pretty much always no, since I buy myself stuff I like at the store and am not hungry. M, on the other hand, doesn't have as much money so she needs to eat at the caffeteria. Whenever i tell her to just eat without me, she says how she's embarrassed to go there alone. After begging me for a bit, she finally gives up and stops asking, but doesn't end up going to eat at all.  But I'm starting to feel a bit, I don't know.... Bad? Like, she's not eating because of ME basically. I don't know what to do\ud83e\udd79 ",

        "selftext": "So, am I the asshole for asking my sister when I'd be paid back? A few months ago, my mother asked me for a few hundred dollars to go on a trip, promising to give me back an extra $25 for every $100 I lent her. I gave her $400, so she was supposed to pay me back $500. Before she had the chance to repay me, my sister asked to borrow money. Since I was low on cash at the time, I told her she could ask our mother for some of the money she owed me. My sister ended up taking $100, but she never paid me back. Fast forward a few months, and she went to the casino and lost all her money. She called me, asking if I could lend her some. I didn\u2019t know at the time that she had blown it all gambling, but I was already annoyed because she hadn\u2019t repaid me from before. Still, since she has kids, I relented and offered her $100. Her immediate response was, *That's all?* I had already been left unpaid once, and I wasn\u2019t willing to give her more, so I confirmed that $100 was all I was offering. She took it and promised to pay me back on Monday. Three days later, on Monday, I asked her if she was going to pay me back. Instead of answering, she just said, *Why?* I asked again, and she repeated, *Why?* I reminded her that she had promised to pay me back Monday, but she flat-out denied ever saying that. Maybe I misheard her over the phone, but considering she had just bought three subs for $40, I pressed again, asking when she planned to repay me. At that point, she got angry, snapped, *I'm not dealing with this,* stormed out of the room, grabbed the money I had given her, and shoved it back into my hands.",

I do like weed but don't care enough to go to the trouble to procure it, but if someone offers me a smoke, I'm down. My fiance drinks more when he does, drinks more often and harder than I do, but it's not to the extent of having a problem.  My SIL's friend (24F) invited me to hang out with them, go to the beach and drink. I decided why not.  So, we drank a bit, went to the beach, and I got super high. It's been a year since the last time I smoked, so yeah... I was having a great time, everyone was enjoying themselves. Nothing bad happened. The sober one in our group would check on me, people were chatting with me and keeping me company.  I come home, make myself some food, and go to bed. My fiance is sleeping and remains so until he leaves for work.  Now I feel like a piece of s***, because my fiance calls me today, asked me about last night and is mad at me and telling me that his vision of me is tarnished in his eyes because I went out late and got high.  He's saying those are things that ghetto people do, that's not the kind of thing I would do and he thought I was better than that. We've been together for 6 years. I hardly go out. I feel hurt by his judgment. He said I am very easy to peer pressure and that he's disappointed in me.   I've never been opposed to smoking weed and he knows this, but is seemingly judging me for smoking when I had an opportunity. I'm not someone who gets stoned often, and I wouldn't want to be tbh. It's just hurtful that he feels I can't be trusted with myself and it's as if he views me as lesser because of last night.  AITA for getting high with my SIL and friends?",

Well now our insurance has finally settled the claim and decided we are going to get paid out $10,000 for my car. I have had quite a few listings saved on marketplace & Kijiji and I have narrowed it down to a few in the city an hour away. I\u2019m a SAHM so I do not have a bank account so the funds went to my our joint account (my husband is the primary). Now he is saying we cannot spend 10,000 on a car (the car I want is $8000) we should buy this car (a literal junker from 2008) for $4000 because he wants to save the rest of it in case we \u201cget into a bind\u201d. He also keeps bringing up the fact that we could buy the $8000 car and it could have just as many problems as the $4000 one. I know he has financial anxiety from when we were struggling during 2020 but it\u2019s getting so over the top lately. We are not financially struggling and we don\u2019t have huge debt either. I\u2019m strongly disagreeing with this because I want a safe reliable vehicle to drive my two kids (and dog occasionally) around in. I don\u2019t want to constantly worry about it breaking down. (The vehicle that we are currently borrowing from a family member is quite old and has a bunch of problems with it) We have had straight up fights about this in the past few days and honestly I\u2019m tired of it.

        "selftext": "To give a quick back story- I started talking to this guy on a dating app (it rhymes with blinder \ud83d\ude07). Anyway we hit it off real quick, discover we have a lot of the same interests, think really similarly on some pretty divisive issues, and just generally vibe well. I\u2019m enjoying the conversation, we talk pretty steadily through the evening 4-5 hours worth or so. I think he\u2019s cool, we are being authentic and honest- it\u2019s really refreshing honestly.  Before we started talking though I was carrying on a couple conversations with some other guys. Like you do on a dating app lol. None of them were as interesting or seemingly compatible as this guy. But they were good conversations too and you never know what\u2019ll pan out. I\u2019m taking awhile to respond (like maybe 1-2 min) and the conversation proceeds thusly: Him: \u201cAre you busy? We can talk later\u201d Me: \u201cNah just chatting with a couple other folks so having to rotate through the convos\u201d Him: \u201cOh like other guys?\u201d \u201cOuch\u201d Me: \u201cOuch?\u201d \u201cBut yes, other guys\u201d Him: \u201cOkay I\u2019ll leave ya to it\u201d Me: \u201cok\u2026?\u201d Him: \u201cNot great when you\u2019re vibing with someone to hear that they\u2019re talking to multiple guys, as you\u2019re trying to talk to him.\u201d Me: \u201cI mean you asked\u201d \u201cwhat would you have me do? Lie to you?\u201d\u201cI had several conversations going before we even talked. I\u2019m not going to just ignore them\u201d Him: \u201cI\u2019m looking for a relationship. Not looking to waste my time on someone who has to keep conversations with several people hoping one clicks.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m so glad you were honest. Doesn\u2019t make it any less rude and disingenuous\u201d Me: \u201cI don\u2019t see how there\u2019s anything rude or disingenuous about it\u201d\u201cwe literally started talking tonight\u201d \u201cJealousy at this stage is a red flag for sure\u201d Him: \u201cLmao gas lighting? You switched up real quick mate\u201d Me: \u201cI\u2019m not gaslighting you.\u201d Him: \u201cget fucked stud\u201d Me: \u201cit just seems weird\u201d Then he proceeds to block me.  I\u2019m just so confused \ud83d\ude15. He made it clear that he really liked me, kept complimenting my appearance and how crazy it is that we have so much in common etc. and then just gets crazy jealous out of nowhere.  AITA? P.s. Before you say I should\u2019ve just lied to him. I don\u2019t lie, and I\u2019m pretty sure I told him that at the beginning.  tl;dr- guy on dating app, day one, gets pissed I\u2019m still talking with other guys.  **UPDATE- it appears the majority thinks I\u2019m NTA. I have learned how I could\u2019ve handled the situation better. I\u2019m grateful to everyone that responded.  Interestingly, those that felt YTA were almost all very passionate in their responses, way more so than the NTA crowd. Draw whatever conclusions from that you will**",

        "selftext": "I (M19) and my gf (f19) live 70 miles apart. She attends college in a neighboring city. She doesn't have a car, so I drive often. I picked her up and dropped her off this weekend. Because of the distance, my tiredness, and honestly, the intimidation of it, I had let the car get bad-messy. She took charge and cleaned it with me, and set a rule where I was not to eat in my car. She forgot her wallet and keys at home, so I drove them to her yesterday (Monday) despite her mom's opinion and some tiredness.  Today, I had a dentist's appointment in the morning and dinner with my friend. I decided to run some errands along the way and hit the gym. I had lent her my headphones when hers broke, so I stopped by and grabbed a cheap temporary/backup pair. So, there were a few receipts and the empty box, plus 5 bags in the backseat. I had forgotten to bring a trash bag for the car and planned clear it at home. While I was eating KBBQ with my friend, she messaged me she needed a hug stat and had half-jokingly mentioned she wanted food from her favorite restaurant. She has panic attacks sometimes, so I always want to make sure she feels supported. I wrapped up the evening within 15 mins. I overate badly, but I walked to my car with my friend, said goodbye, and drove to the restaurant (25 mins). I picked up the order, and drove another hour+ to her university. Parked, and brought the food up to her.  I wasn't planning to drive tonight, so I was exhausted and passed out on the couch next to her while she did some work. We drove to a park we frequent because she wanted to. She wanted to lay down. I asked her if she wanted to return to the dorm and she declined, so we napped.  She woke up and wanted to move to the backseat. She told me to clear the backseat, so I did. Then she told me to raise my seat up and switch to hers. I told her I was gonna put the passenger seat down. She was upset I was talking back to her and wanted to return to the dorm.  While driving back, she told me how my car was already so messy again despite how important it was to her. She mentioned the receipts, the bags I had moved, and the nail file up front (I have a bad nail biting habit). I told her I had no idea I was going to come tonight and was planning to clean the car when I got home. She told me my plans are meaningless because I didn't plan well for her birthday (2 months ago). This is something I have apologized for repeatedly, and have tried to make up to her. I tried to explain that the car would have been clean before we had planned to meet, but I was rushing since she told me she needed me stat. I tried explaining I understood her feelings, and tried validating them while staying firm. Argument continued until she was making preparations to leave. I asked her if she wanted me to walk her back. She declined. I told her I loved her, she said something I didn't hear, and she closed the door hard. AITA?",

I wasn't even upset about not getting my wig of choice, I was upset because I tend to put his feelings ahead of mine and the one time I really wanted something, I still had to compromise.  If it were based on other reasons like budget, I wouldn't even mind forgoing it completely.  It just really sucked because I put a lot of thought into what I\u2019d get him solely based on what he likes.

As per indian traditions i ain't allowed to use my left hand for eating for some reason so yeah and my parents are kinda strict about that and i'm the only leftie in my family so no one knows how it works tbh. About 3 years ago in like 2022 i went for a family dinner where there was another dude who was a lefie and was eating with his left hand pretty much some of the kids over there asked me why i was using my right hand and i told i kinda got used with it. Ps my parents used to bs talk about that kid to me for using his left hand for eating. Later when we went to the room some of em even asked if i yk wiped my butt with the same hand or not. It felt so weird and i could never forget that. Even when i went to Thailand last year with a bunch of family friends some of the kids and adults went to try the street food and i didn't wanna try them cuz my tummy hella sensitive so i just opted for an indian restaurant with the adults and like 2 of my friends, a guy in uni and another girl a year elder to me. The guys mother was with us in a table of four and when i was using my right hand for my knife she asked me why i was using it and her son kinda gave the signal of not asking me about it. It was kinda weird again for like a few mins then it kinda got normal. Fast forward to this year i wanted to change so from like day before yesterday i tried switching to the normal left hand maneuvers and yesterday i started eating with my left hand. Felt hard to eat with it like tearing the roti and shi but yeah i had to get used to it. Today my mom saw me eating with my left hand and she kinda got mad and told my dad. Never seen my dad get this mad and he ruined my entire day. I tried explaining my mom how it works for us lefties but she just ignored me and told no food unless you change how you eat. My parents are quite egoistic so yeah pretty much my situations cooked. Ps just wanted to vent and clear my mind. Feel free to suggest me anything would respond a bit later cuz i got my finals next week so gotta study for that. Thanks again for anyone suggesting to me about this situation.",

        "selftext": "Im a pretty young female, and me and my sister live across the US from eachother. This summer I went to visit her and my mom, whom I hadn't seen in about 2 years. I was supposed to stay there from the middle of June until the beginning of July. Now, about 2-3 months prior, I had dislocated my knee and landed on said knee while falling. I also had to sit screaming for help in that position for almost 30 minutes, and then had to wait an extra 15 for my dean to finally come to my room and get me to the hospital--where they told me I had fractured something, I dont really know what, but it was small enough to where it could heal on its own without surgery. At my grandma's she has this huge case of stairs, which im scared to go down due to how unsafe they feel--since they have huge gaps and im scared of falling--but especially since I had just stopped using the cast I had on, my knee sometimes hurt when put under pressure when walking down stairs, running, etc. \u00a0After about 3-4 weeks, I got homesick and decided I would go back early. I wasn't really feeling any semblance of joy based on the past experiences with this side of my family, and it didn't seem like they had changed at all. So, about 4 days after that, I was driving with my grandparents and sister to the airport. I waved my sister and grandma goodbye (grandpa stayed in the car) and was on my merry way. However, while waiting for boarding time, my heart sunk. My sister texted me a video, which I listened to--showing how my grandma was saying in explicit detail how much weight I had gained since they last saw me, and how all that weight must have been why my knee was hurting so much, even though i had stated many times that I had dislocated my knee. I fully went up and texted her, going on a long rant about why she would say things like that behind my back and she couldn't be talking, seeing that she would constantly complain on how big she was. A few minutes later, she saw it--responding basically blaming everything on my sister, and how she shouldnt have told me lies and she was trying to ruin the family by spouting a bunch of BS. I told her that I saw video proof, where she again tried to blame my sister. My sister texted me that my grandma was yelling at her, and honestly I felt even worse. I failed to realize that this would probably effect her standing with our grandma. However we talked it out and she seemed to not care about it because she doesnt wanna be around someone who talks to me like that anyways. My mom also texted me, telling me about how I shouldnt have said anything and shouldve let it go. However, I dont think I shouldve. My grandma has a history about talking to people like this, constantly belittling others and trying to make herself feel good. I thought it was time somebody tell her back on it. So reddit, AITA for telling off my grandma when she told my sister the reason my knee hurt was because of all the extra weight I had on me?? ",

        "selftext": "For context,my mother has permanent legal custody of my niece & nephew,who are 9 & 11.Shes been allowing them to come over to my house&hang out with my 12 yr old (their cousin) when she's at home on her own after school.There are 3 days pw that I dont get home from work until approx 5.45pm My 12 yr old just started high school,year 7,this week,& I feel it's time that she starts having some independence by coming home after school & being here on her own for 2 hrs max til I get home. Plus current circumstances make it the most convenient, affordable, least stressful option. It's a good way to ease us both in to her growing and upcoming independence etc. Previously shes been too scared to stay home on her own for even 15 mins in the middle of the daytime. Anyway so I'm not currently comfortable with other kids coming over after school &hanging out in our house unsupervised, For numerous reasons including the above,as well as when shes with friends they tend to behave more irresponsibly so I don't think zero supervision is appropriate yet, plus the friends either dont know or straight ignore the house rules with no adult present to advise,they get more careless with basic safety stuff, plus as she's started high school we are trying to implement a new routine for after school to incorporate homework& all that stuff as well as introducing new responsibilities related to her age & school&expenses etc which friends coming over after school are a distraction blah blah.  Additionally, specific to my niece and nephew, THEY are only 9 and 11.  Anyway I told my mother tonight that moving forward I dont want friends/other kids coming over after school when my daughter is home on her own. And she got offended. She didnt argue with me as such, but she just did a 'face' & didn't reply anything at all and then just continued to leave& didn't say bye or anything. Basically,I know my mother &her reaction means she was offended in some way. I'm not sure what offence she took exactly,but she wasn't in agreeance &it's clear she was annoyed in some way,but she also wasnt willing to explain that to me either.So I'm wondering,AITA here, I mean I know that all families and households are different & have different opinions & expectations of their kids & homes & parenting etc, but is my request THAT extreme, like way out of line or crazy that she should be offended and annoyed at me for even suggesting this ?? I said it in a nice way, not angry or anything like that, I wasn't expecting this reaction so I had no reason to be defensive or anything at that stage,I'm very confused. To be clear, this relates to ALL kids, my daughter's school friends etc as well, its not ONLY my niece and nephew I said shouldn't come over to hang out here unsupervised blah blah. Her school friends parents were ok with it,one of them said she is doing the same at their house so \ud83e\udd37 ",

        "selftext": "TL;DR my wife\u2019s mother told her that she and her dad may not be able to go on our trip, so now she wants to cancel the whole thing. I told her that even if it gets down to just her, our child, and I, we could still have a great time and make great memories. This has turned into a major fight now. I\u2019m on a throwaway because I have family on Reddit and they like this sub. My wife and I randomly and recently decided to plan a rather large vacation that would involve us (wife, child, and I) and bout of our parents. The dates were not set, but we had a general idea of when we wanted to go. I work in a job that isn\u2019t the easiest to get time off with, so I started getting the ball rolling on my end of things to make it easier for when I do have dates. This included changing and planning ConEd dates to allow for the possible window we would be going. Not a problem, just trying to make sure there are no hiccups when more concrete details come through. The other day, she tells me that due to some changes (nothing medical or financial), her parents may not be able to go with us. That soured her mood entirely about the whole thing. She became despondent and finally said that she thinks we just shouldn\u2019t go. I told her that I was sorry about her parents not being able to go, but that shouldn\u2019t stop us from going, even if my parents couldn\u2019t go either. This would be our first family vacation with our child and it would be a chance to make some special memories, especially since he will be about 2 by the time we go. She got quiet and eventually just said good night and walked away. Later on, she texts me about how upset she is by what I have said and that she does not want to talk about this until she is ready because she doesn\u2019t want to say things she doesn\u2019t mean. I have my own opinions about that, but I respected her wishes. I told her that it was not my intention to upset her and that I was sorry that I had.  I just want to know if I am being an asshole because I don\u2019t think we should cancel this trip over one cancellation? I saw this more in the light of it being focused on the three of us, but it seems like she was more interested in having her parents go than even letting our child have this opportunity. ",

One time I caught him snapping photos of me when I was going through a drawer in my kitchen. I told him to not take pictures of me without my knowledge again. He says it\u2019s because \u201cI\u2019m So BeAuTiFuL\u201d but I don\u2019t buy it. Then another time I found him on my phone sending my own selfies to his phone. I was so creeped out. Another time, I found a picture of myself and him on his FB stories. In the picture I am completely unaware that he was taking a photo of us. It\u2019s creepy. The last straw was when I was sitting at his dining room table, he snapped a photo of me, thinking I wasn\u2019t paying attention. I got SO mad and flipped out and called him a creep and a loser. I told him I lost all respect and trust in him and that we are no longer friends.  Did I overreact? I don\u2019t think I did. Why would a guy friend do that? Has anybody here had similar experiences?

        "selftext": "Recently my father and I got into a huge political disagreement. We've always disagreed about some topics but over the years he's gotten worse. I (20 F) and my dad (45 M) have always talked about changes in the country or things that scare us. We used to be able to have a normal Ish conversation about these topics which include women's health or gay rights, but he's gotten increasingly more hostile about the conversation topics. A few months ago, I stopped talking to him for a few weeks because of it. It was really hard for me because the conversation ended with him saying cruel things to me. Such as... you need a man to get preg. Can't elaborate more but I'm sure you get what he said. For more context, I'm gay and engaged to a woman. We've been engaged for about 6 months now and were planning on wait till she was finished with school. Now we're both scared with the current circumstances that we won't have that chance. Though nothing is for certain of course, nothing is impossible. With the recent TikTok ban, which everyone has entitled opinions about, I tried to have a conversation with my dad about this and he turned into a screaming a-hole. It was an hour-long conversation which I did my best to be respectful, but he started to make comments about my age claiming that my opinions didn't matter because of that. Anytime I tried to speak he cut me off to yell at me. I can't go to in depth with our political beliefs because it is against guidelines, but he is red, and I am neither or. I can't agree with much of anything on the red or blue side because of my beliefs and things I've done for my own personal research.  After about an hour of him yelling and screaming at me, I finally put my foot down and told him, If you continue to yell at me, I will hang up this call and we can go a few months without speaking. This is my boundary, and you need to respect it. I never want to talk about these things with you because we obviously can't come to a mutual agreement- he cut me off to continue screaming at me and calling me a child.  I hung up and blocked him on everything. I felt so guilty for it. Now my fianc\u00e9 and I have our wedding planned in March. It's been a couple weeks since my father and I have spoken but he wanted to be there and make the rings for us as well. I feel extremely conflicted because my mom is performing the ceremony for us. She has her opinion about the situation and seems to think it's a good idea if he's not there. I've made jokes about it in passing but it's making me feel so sick to my stomach. This is my first wedding and the first relationship that has been healthy for me. Both of my parents love her, and I wanted to have everyone there. Now I don't know what to do. I'm scared my mom's side of the family will disagree with me and say that I'm wrong for inviting him, but I'm scared that I will feel guilty for the rest of my life for not trying to fix things with him so he can be there. AITAH if I don't invite him?",

My roommate (M 34) is having a stressful week at work and works most days from our apartment. On Monday and Tuesday, I went to the gym to work out with my friend who\u2019s a personal trainer and training me for free on his time. So, I left at 4:30 and came back at 6:30 and my roommate said he cannot handle dog watching while I\u2019m away and he\u2019s working. This is the calmest and least needy dog I\u2019ve ever met and he\u2019s a 10 years old yorkipoo. He just sleeps and occasionally barks when he hears our neighbors coming and going. My roommate said that he can\u2019t mentally separate having a dog hanging out at home or if I had brought home a guest and then left him alone to entertain my friend. I just needed 2 hours away to workout. My roommate was at the office most of the day Monday and Tuesday and then came home and had more work to do. He came home just as I was leaving for the gym at 4:30 and I came home and was lectured more about how I didn\u2019t listen to him and left him alone to dog sit again. I don\u2019t see how this is dog sitting; he doesn\u2019t have to walk, feed, or even interact with the dog. So, am I the asshole for not understanding where he\u2019s coming from and still trying to go to the gym for my 2 hours?  EDIT for more info: I did inform my roommate that I would be taking care of the dog for a month and he said that was totally fine. I\u2019ve also spent multiple days away with the dog at my boyfriend\u2019s place to give my roommate more space when he\u2019s working from home. This week, he\u2019s working at the office most days til 4 and I leave for the gym at 4:30. I plan on spending the rest of the week at my boyfriend\u2019s place since I know this week is a lot for my roommate. But that\u2019s also a big inconvenience for me and adds an additional 25 to 40 minutes to any commute I have to make which is usually only 5 to 10 mins. I also have to go grocery shopping so I have food at my boyfriend\u2019s place and pack enough clothes for the week. Doing all that so he doesn\u2019t have to spend 2 hours alone with the dog just seems like a lot. ",

At that point, I had already made up my mind, so I went. At the ball, I realized my friends had lied about not being there yet and ignored me all night. The next day, a friend texted me saying they thought it was unfair of me to back out of my promise. I explained what happened, but they said I never really tried to be part of the group. *(tbh i never felt like I was, thats why I wanted to go to the ball so desperatly to not miss another group activity since, i didnt take part in them the last few months for personal reasons).* I ended up leaving the group chat because I didn\u2019t feel welcome.

For 2 years before she actually moved out the whole family were trying to encourage her to move out and go to university to study psychology which had been her dream for a long time. But at first she decided to just take a year and go work to save up some money. After that she went and actually tried to get into a university but she didn't get in but that turned out to be a lie. She just didn't take the spot because she was scared to live alone. But finally she applied to a school this time to study engineering and got in and moved out. After that she started visiting home every other week, staying the weekends, whole weeks etc. The thing is she has to sleep in my room during those times (we used to share a room also before she moved). So at some point it started getting pretty frustrating because I wanted some peace but couldn't because I always had to prep the room for her (I had to move heavy furniture so she would have a spot) and then last time she visited she got mad at me for not moving the furniture (I had hurt my back badly so I couldn't) and also for not getting her a towel or a pillow/blanket. She even went and complained to our mom about it. She complained about me the whole time she was visiting to everyone including my brother's gf who she isn't even close with. So the day she left I told her that I don't want her to visit anymore because of her behavior and also because I honestly just am frustrated at her for always coming to stay over. My mom got mad at me for this but my dad told me that how I reacted was valid bc of her behavior.So AITA? ",

She ran away when she was 14, and has been couch surfing/staying with her mom (who I don\u2019t know much about)/living at a group home since then. She didn\u2019t see her dad much at all in that time, maybe once a month for a few minutes so he could give her money. Past that she refused to see him entirely. For the last few weeks she\u2019s started coming to our house almost every day.  I don\u2019t mind her coming over, I would hope that her and her dad would have a good relationship and see each other. This issue is we all smoke weed. The daughter smokes weed as well, and I have conflicting opinions on that, I was a huge stoner (among many other things) as a teenager and know that telling a teen that\u2019s already into that kind of thing what to do doesn\u2019t work. It didn\u2019t work on me and I\u2019m sure it wouldn\u2019t work on the daughter. She\u2019s gonna do what she\u2019s gonna do and I\u2019m not her parent so I\u2019m not one to tell her what to do anyway. But roommate will actively get high with his underage daughter (and her friends!!) in our house, and it makes me DEEPLY uncomfortable. When she\u2019s here I just keep to my room, because in my opinion it\u2019s incredibly inappropriate to do things like that with a child and I don\u2019t want to be around it. When I try to talk to roommate about it he just laughs it off and won\u2019t engage with the conversation. I don\u2019t know how to get it through his head that it\u2019s not okay to get a kid high (especially ones that aren\u2019t yours!!!). It bothers me even more because I\u2019m on (unsupervised) parole and if anything were to happen and police found out what he was doing that I could be implicated or associated with it and they would take me back to jail.  I might be TA because this is the first time in a long time his daughter has been willing to spend any time with him, and I\u2019d hate to get in the way of them having a friendly relationship (and I firmly believe he is not capable of having a parental relationship with her, mostly because of who he is as a person but also because I don\u2019t think she would allow for it and would disappear again) She has asked why I don\u2019t hang out with them when she\u2019s over (I\u2019m the only woman in the house and I can tell she wants me to like her, and I do! I just cannot be around that) I\u2019ve made excuses about not feeling good, etc. because I don\u2019t want to badmouth her dad to her but I\u2019m 3 seconds away from saying \u201cbecause I respect you enough as a person and a child to not behave like that around you, and because there\u2019s something deeply wrong with adults who will partake with children\u201d the next time she asks. I\u2019m not sure what to do here, I don\u2019t want to be the reason they have no relationship, she\u2019s not my kid so I have no say over what she does (and neither do her actual parents it seems), but this puts me at risk and when I tell the roommate that he does not listen.

        "selftext": "PSA: English isn\u2019t my first language, so please be kind. I (26F) have been married to my husband (32M) for almost a year now, and we\u2019ve been together for five years. We come from different countries and cultures. We met in 2020 in my hometown while he was there for work and got stuck due to COVID. At the time, I was doing my MBA. By the time I graduated and started job hunting, it was time for him to go back. He wasn\u2019t sure when or if he\u2019d return, and neither of us wanted to do long distance, so we decided I wouldn\u2019t take a job and would go with him instead. I started working in his business and received a salary. We traveled a lot for work and were together 24/7. In 2022, he and his business partners sold that business and made good money. My husband already owned some property, and after selling the business, he bought more and made various investments. He works a lot\u2014he\u2019s a professor, a business owner, a trader, and much more. Over time, I started helping him with almost everything. I didn\u2019t get a salary, but he always told me, \u201cMy money is your money,\u201d and I never had to ask for anything. I always had more than enough, and he even helps my family. Still, it sometimes bothered me that I didn\u2019t personally own anything. In 2023, we got engaged, and in the summer of 2024, we got married. That same year, he bought another business with his friend and my FIL (75M) as partners. The business needed a lot of setup and administration work, but my husband was too busy to handle it. His friend works full-time, so he couldn\u2019t help much, and his father is a silent partner. Naturally, all the work fell on me. For the past 10 months, I\u2019ve been working on this business 24/7 hiring people, managing marketing, setting everything up, solving endless problems, and doing a million other things. I don\u2019t mind not owning anything in the business, we\u2019re married, and what\u2019s his is mine but what does bother me is how my FIL treats me. During meetings, when I present ideas and get everyone up to speed, my husband always acknowledges my work, saying things like, \u201cThanks to OP, we\u2019re able to run this business.\u201d But my FIL constantly downplays my role, acting as if I\u2019m just an employee. He even tries to take credit, saying buying the business was his idea. Last week, he did the same thing. Downplaying  my role and even telling me to take notes, as if I were some intern and not the person leading the meeting. That\u2019s when I started thinking: if my husband expects me to keep working on this business, maybe I should ask for some shares in it. I brought this up to my mom, and she lost it on me. She said, \u201cHe\u2019s your husband, why would you ask him for that? You shouldn\u2019t pay attention to your FIL. What\u2019s his is yours, and you should be thankful because he\u2019s so kind.\u201d In my culture, men are put on a pedestal even when they don\u2019t deserve it, and my husband is amazing, so of course, my mom is biased. I don\u2019t really have friends I can talk to about this, so, internet strangers AITA for asking for shares in his business?",

Initially, I didn't really consider she may have done this. It wasn't until she got so defensive thag I was really concerned. I wasn't trying to shame her or anything. She's my favorite person in the world and my best friend. I was just worried about what she said. She has accused ms of attacking her. Am I the asshole for confronting what I saw as a red flag?",

        "selftext": "AITA for not summarizing TV shows for my husband? [Update in comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/qm07zWV2xg) Ongoing argument between my husband and me. I'll be watching a show, and he'll come in partway through and watch a few minutes. He might watch bits and pieces as he comes and goes. Since he knows a little about what's happening, when he comes back he'll ask, So what happened with the suspect? Why did they break up? It's not always a one sentence answer, and it takes me out of watching the show to have to summarize what happened. And I know it sounds silly, but if I'm watching a show to relax, I don't want to have to sit and think about how to explain what happened.  Our most recent argument was when I was watching Will Trent and he had asked me 3-4 questions already that I answered. Finally he asked me another, and I told him, exasperated, to just look online. (Something I've started saying to him when I don't want to answer.) He argued that it would just take a few seconds to answer the question. I told him any reasonable person would agree with me, so here we are. Btw, this is not a serious fight. I am exasperated with him, but neither of us are seriously upset and we love each other very much. Even if I do want to throw a pillow at him when he does stuff like this.  So what says reddit? Edited to give my husband's perspective: I was in the middle of watching the episode, and fell asleep. When I woke up, the episode was over. I asked my wife how it ended and she refused to tell me.",

        "selftext": "Me (18M) and my friend (25M) are moving to a cheaper place next week and plan to stay there for three more years until we graduate from university. We live in a very small town- about 5000 inhabitants- that has a LOT of stray dogs, people unfortunately take them to the campus\u2019s farm and abandon them as puppies. Recently two more pups were found in campus, so we talked about it and adopting one of them didn\u2019t seem like a bad idea, our new house has a fairly big garden space and one small dog is easy enough to take around if after graduating we decide to move into a bigger city. Well\u2026 turns out this other girl, let\u2019s call her Jane, has been posting around photos of the abandoned puppies and making go funds me to take them to a vet and castrate them, and we told her that we\u2019d be taking one of them home, for her not to worry. It was fine for a day, until I received a message from Jane saying she took both of them to her house (she has 7 stray dogs that are sick and decided to take in two puppies) until we moved to the new house. I found it weird, because well\u2026 why was she doing that? But I decided to donate a hundred bucks for her to get some dog food and keep them until next week. I made it very clear which one of them we would take and that we preferred to take her to the vet ourselves.Some time passed and she just texted my friend \u201chey, would you be upset if I donated both of the puppies to my friend? I don\u2019t want to separate them since they\u2019re siblings\u201d and tried to guilt trip him into either adopting both or none. For context: he\u2019s autistic and cares a lot about animals, so when she did that he agreed to take in both.Fast forward to today, I just discovered all of that, that we would be taking both, and also that she got 500 bucks in debt with the local vet because she decided to take both of them and said WE would pay for both consults, meds and surgeries. I got very upset that we\u2019re now in debt with the vet, for two dogs we haven\u2019t even adopted yet for a bunch of stuff they didn\u2019t even need in the first place and that I wasn\u2019t aware of. I messaged her to try and understand what was she doing, she cursed a lot and basically told me to never direct a word at her again.I don\u2019t want anything to do with this situation anymore and my friend also agrees this is out of hand. I feel really bad that we told her we\u2019d take a dog and she spent a lot of money and time and effort, but I never asked her help in any way, she just jumped in as an adoption manager and invented a bunch of problems as if she was elected responsible for all the abandoned dogs in the city.  AITA for not wanting anything to do with this anymore and giving up on adopting one of them? ",

        "selftext": "for years I (24F) lived in a house, that Shelly (F25) who was my friend from since elementary, got from her granddad.I moved in when I was 17 and because we were friends she let me live there for years paying cheap rent (utilities not included). She never thought to make me sign a lease.  the house isnt big but theres 2 bedrooms. a few months ago I was asked if I would be okay with a new roomate. it was getting cold out meaning gas bills would go up, so I thought it would be great to have help.   I never saw this roomate after he moved in. a month later when I started noticing things like dirty shoeprints, unclean toilet, and garbage being left around the house. I was frustrated because whenever I knocked on his door to hopefully talk suddenly his tv would turn up and id get no answer. I always only ever knocked once and never pestered. I told Shelly about this and asked if she could talk to him for me. she told me she would however things took a direction that I didn't expect.  fast forward to last month. it was a Saturday and I was going to sit down and have some drinks awhile watching tv to reward myself for a promotion I got. I stayed up late watching movies when I hear my roomate go past my door towards the front at almost 4am. I also only realized in that moment it was nearly 4am so I turned my tv off to go to bed not thinking much of it. thats when i got a knock on my door.  I said hello? and heard Shelly. she asked me how I was and I told her I was drunk and about to go to bed hinting I didnt really wanna talk. she then opened my door.  I was taken aback but too dazed to really process what just happened. she then tells me that she talked to him and that shes come to the decision that she wants to evict me. I was startled since I don't have anyone to fall back on and the housing market is evil. if i cant find a house ill be on the streets. I asked why shes doing this and she tells me that during her talk he told her I was creepy and stalkerish but she didnt go into detail about what that even meant. she told me to be out of the house by 30 days then left. I couldn't go back to bed after that. I was too busy trying to find a new place to live because I didnt want to spend energy fighting in court unless necessary. thankfully about 5 days before i was expected to be gone I found a new house to rent. but if i were to pay my last months of rent I wouldn't be able to afford the damage deposit which needed to be paid before i was allowed to move in. I decided that, because of how she evicted me for no reason and there was no lease that I wasn't going to pay.  Its been only a week and shes gone out of her way to leave at least 3 hand written letters at my new place still damanding rent. when I talked to a few different friends about this ive gotten different responses. because of these mixed messages and some guilt im feeling for someone I knew since we were kids, im writing this post now.

The other day, several roommates were in the kitchen making dinner or finding food, and one had just entered the kitchen holding her iPad, watching a lecture video or something.  I was about to pull a hot tray of food from the oven, so I loudly announced I was opening the oven and for everyone to watch out.  The roommate next to me stepped out of the way, so I know there was plenty of time to react, but the roommate holding her iPad did not move.  I backed into her when I stepped back to open the oven door, and she dropped her iPad on the ground.  She did not have a case or screen protector on her iPad, and when she picked it up, the screen was cracked in a few places, but the iPad still worked fine.  She immediately got mad at me for causing her to drop her iPad.  I apologized, told her it was an accident, and asked if she heard me when I said I was opening the oven.  She said she did, but I should have made sure there wasn\u2019t anyone in the way before I moved.  She then demanded I replace her iPad because it was my fault.  I told her it wasn\u2019t my fault, she should have watched out when I said to.  She also didn\u2019t have a case or screen protector, which was irresponsible, and only the screen was broken, so there was no need to replace the entire iPad.  I told her I would help with the cost of replacing the screen, but she insisted she needed a new one and it was my responsibility to pay for it.

He claimed that I shouldn\u2019t take it to school, since it\u2019s not necessary. But, I PAYED for it with MY money, getting rid of the school fees. Therefore, it is MY tablet, not his. As such, it is my choice to bring it to school. After saying this, he demanded i give him the IP so he could TAKE IT OFF THE WIFI, which I did not allow. Eventually, my MOM had enough once he started slamming it on the table. She told him to stop, that that tablet was expensive (the usage fee was $500!) and that he e take it off the WIFI, she wouldn\u2019t allow him to do that. This all started because he said he unplugged it last night to plug in one of my brother\u2019s phones, and left it unplugged. But I insisted that he must have done it earlier, because the battery showed it had been plugged in after I got home from school at 3, and was NOT CHARGING 30-ish minutes later, so SOMEONE MUST HAVE TAKEN IT OFF THE CHARGER. I didn\u2019t see who because I had work that night, and I left the tablet there because I usually take it to use on my break, but I wasn\u2019t getting one that day, and it needed to charge. Flash back to the argument, I\u2019m trying ti show him the charge data, but he won\u2019t even let me touch the tablet, demanding I give him the IP, my mom telling him to stop. Eventually, my mom took it from him and placed it on the counter and plugged it in, and told him not to touch it, since it was mine and not his to take control of. (Paraphrased, i don\u2019t remember the entire conversation)  His POV: Im always on a \u201cscreen\u201d (yes, thats how he refers to them) and when im not on one, I \u201cSit on my ass all day\u201d That time im on my ass? School, work and just relaxing at home. I use my phone a lot, yes, but thats because a) im a teenager. b) im fed up with his thinking just because hes the adult, hes always right, and any other viewpoint is \u201cwrong\u201d so i go on reddit to escape. c) i just don\u2019t vibe with things like sports or nature, but LOVE video games.  I dont SEE a reason to go outside if nothing outside interests me. Keep in mind, hes my STEPdad. His three daughters went with his ex, and they used to visit often, but now they rarely show, if at all. He seems very disgruntled about it, and he drinks a good amount, to the point he just watched my brothers\u2019 band and orchestra performances on the school streaming channel, cuz he\u2019s probably too drunk to drive safely there and back.

        "selftext": "I (18f) moved away from my family in 2023 for studies. I\u2019ll be finished this year, and afterwards I am planing to stay here for studies. The place i am renting is only for duration of my studies. My cousin (f18) studies in a different place but wants to move here after studies. And my other cousin (m16) as well. So, this brought up the idea from my family. That two of my cousins can all move together to one apartment. I refused for a couple of reasons.  1. My cousin (f18) is involved with a lot of boys despite her parents being against it. In one occasion she sneaked out with her bf (now ex) during an important family function. The whole extended family somehow blamed me for it, even though i tried to stop her from doing it and even defending her. She also threw me under the bus, so even after years they still bring it up and blame me. Also i got scolded right there and then. This really changed how i see my family, and thats also one of the reasons i moved so far away even though i had the choice to not.  2. She again used my name to get out of meeting up with another bf. She wasnt caught but i felt really betrayed. In case they get caught i have no doubt that i will be blamed.  3. The family plays favorites with her. I have no problem with this, as my mom and dad loves me a lot but in some occasions it makes me sad. I struggle with mental health already and i think that it will make it worse.  I know that this is objectively a good, great idea even. Its a lot better to share rent and live with people who i already know. We are still close despite what happened, but living with someone i know is way better than a stranger.  But i am putting all that aside just for my mental health and its selfish of me. My mom and her mom and dad are both really adamant on this decision, and called me ridiculous for not wanting to do it. My mom called me and said that its because i hate her, but i really dont. My dad also doesnt want me to move in with her, because he knows that how much that affected me.  ",

        "selftext": "I (19 Female) have been living with three girls in a decent-sized apartment for the last 5 months, at first, all was going well, however, after about 2 months, I noticed that my stuff wasn't getting taken care of. For context, I lived with one of my roommates during my freshman year of college, and the other two were random, I provided almost everything for this kitchen and had to purchase quite a few things since this is my first time living in an apartment. I made it very clear that everyone was able to use the stuff that I bought but I wanted it to be taken care of (I was also the only one to provide anything for the kitchen so the roommates have been relying on me for everything). Very quickly my plates, bowls and pots and pans began to pile up in the sink and wouldn't be washed for days at a time (I recently had to throw one of my pans away because it hadn't been washed for days and just stayed on the stove as cooked eggs hardened onto it; I'm sure I could have gotten it clean but to me it was the principle of that fact that my roommate hadn't washed it and it is still sitting next to our trash can untouched). I often never had plates or bowls to use and would have to wash someone else's dishes just to use the stuff that I bought. I am also the only one that ever cleans the kitchen, and even after spending an hour cleaning it, it would quickly become a mess again. One of my roommates has also question why she can't find plates when they are in the dishwasher or I'm actively using them. She will also keep my plates in her room for days and I won't have anything to eat off of. I am not a very confrontational person so I didn't say anything about the mess but would sometimes make passive aggressive comments about the kitchen. As the problem continues, I decided to remove some of my things from the kitchen, like my nice pots and pans and my plates and bowls. It started with just a plate and a bowl so that I had something to eat off of but today I decided to remove all of the plates and bowls and my nice silverware from the kitchen, my roommates aren't home yet but I'm worried about how this interaction is going to go but I plan on just making my case and tell them to buy their own stuff. I understand that this could seem really rude, especially because I don't know my roommates financial state and they regularly use my stuff, but it would be a different situation if they washed my stuff after using it or helped with cleaning the kitchen but I've been dealing with this for months now so I'm extremely tired of it. I am not trying to take revenge and it we can come to an agreement then I'll put everything back but until the discussion is had, my stuff is staying in my room. **AITA?** ",

        "selftext": "Im quite bad at story telling so kindly ask for clarification if needed. My family is Asian. For context my sibling 37M is married (2nd time) and we usually don't get along well together. Now he wanted to come back and stay with parents for the time being cause his wife needs to rest at her parent's home(its nearby).I vehemently refused his presence cause we need to share a bathroom. He works from home so he locks his room , won't open the room to allow me to use the bathroom. Other bathrooms are there in house but my parents are old and frequently need to use it. While he stays at home he doesn't help out in household chores, throws a fit if someone tries to use the room/clean the room even. Meanwhile I am the one the parents call whenever they have inconveniences , need to pay online bills, take them to hospital and clean up after them. Surprisingly before his wife got pregnant he apparently wasnt able to move in with parents with wife cause he needed to go to office once a week. Suddenly he is able move back in ? Also I must apparently use the bathroom during normal hours cause needing to poop at 6.30 am in morning is not a normal hours. Hence my refusal to let him move back in. AITA for refusing to put up with him and compromising?  Edit: Cannot move out for atleast next month or so cause I spent last 3 years getting a degree. Awaiting the documents and for other paperwork. Till then I cannot legally work anywhere. 2. Parents have incontinence issues hence need for their own bathroom and privacy. 3. My income over the years has been  less than him since I am younger by almost 8 years. Hence I have just started my earnings whereas he has been working for long and is now earning more along with perks provided by company. My field does not provide me with that sort of salary even at highest position and perks will not be given at any point in life.  Edit 2: Parents also offered to rent out another place nearby which is 1 min away from our house. Either i would move there or they can. He refused. In-laws also welcomed him to stay with them and he does not want to go there as well. ",

        "selftext": "So we\u2019re both 17 and have been dating for nearly 7 months now, the only \u2018argument\u2019 we had was when I got hurt he was mad that I didn\u2019t avoid the person that hurt me. I didn\u2019t really think of it cause they hurt me for fun and probably wouldn\u2019t do it again but I understood his point of view and didnt do it again. I was introducing my boyfriend to my grandparents today. Once we got there everything was fine and he was really nice to my grandparents and I could tell they liked him. We were talking for a while when I pulled out my bus card, I had to get it renewed in two months and I was gonna do it next week when I\u2019m at my grandparents so I could just walk to school. But he kept saying I should do it on the last day since I would be in Japan for two weeks anyway. I said that when I get back it will be during the school holidays so I would have to wait till school was back to pick it up, and I use my bus card a lot more during school holidays. He didn\u2019t take no for an answer and kept acting like I had to do it on the last day, he started grunting and kicking up a fuss over it and I said \u201chey don\u2019t worry it\u2019s not that important\u201d and tryed my best to just defuse the situation, not to mention I felt extremely embarrased because he was doing this infront of my grandparents and I\u2019ve never seen him act like this before. I looked at my phone and saw we were late for our bus and I used that as an excuse to get out of there fast. Once we left through the door I tryed to laugh it all off, \u2018haha we got so carried away with that we might miss the bus\u2019 stuff like that. As we left through the front gate (I was infront the whole time cause I had the key) I said \u201cHey let\u2019s talk about this later, you\u2019re getting a bit worked up and it\u2019s just a bus card dont worry about it\u201d he than said \u201cWell I wouldn\u2019t be worried about it if you went such an idiot\u201d. I was caught off guard since he had never insulted me before and it was out of nowhere to me. I just kept walking and he yelled something I couldn\u2019t quite make out cause, well I was trying not to cry and was failing, but it was something like \u2018are you really\u2026!\u2019. I just sat down at the bus stop since it was infront of the gate and he thanked me sat down next to me and grabbed me and I said let go of me twice while pushing him away (I don\u2019t like touching people when they piss me off) and he didn\u2019t so I raised my voice and he finally let go. I didn\u2019t say anything else we just got on the bus on the bus and I went to wave at him as he left but he didn\u2019t turn around to look at me so he didn\u2019t see that. Anyways he message me after saying he was ready to talk to when I was ready, honestly I just wanted a sorry or a reason for his outburst but nothing. I don\u2019t want to reach out cause I don\u2019t want him thinking he can hurt me and we can go right back to normal straight away.",

        "selftext": "I\u2019m a 27F married to Matt a 27F and we have been married for 4 years now and started dating when we were 19 years old. We met freshman year of college and stayed together both through college and grad school supporting each other in our journey and we are very very happy together and very much in love and living in a beautiful home. My parents as a grad school gift to both my husband and I took us out to a very nice dinner and gave us a surprise gift for a weekend get away. They really went above and beyond and we are beyond appreciative. That being said my MIL (she is a single mom) just pointing that fact out to show there isn\u2019t a FIL in the picture so I don\u2019t get any comments such as, \u201cwhy are you blaming the MIL and not the FIL as well?\u201d My MIL gave just my husband a card with cash and nothing to me. And yes it was made very clear this gift was just for him alone and it wasn\u2019t an assumed card for the couple if that makes sense. According to my husband the verbiage surrounding the card and cash was, \u201cI\u2019m so proud of you son for graduating I know how hard you worked towards your goal of graduating.\u201d I\u2019m very hurt I wasn\u2019t included in the card. It\u2019s not about me getting cash it\u2019s the fact this wasn\u2019t addressed to both of us as husband and wife when we are MARRIED and we literally both just graduated. To me it should automatically be second nature when the person your child has been with since your child was a teenager and who is his wife and DIL and they both achieved this milestone at the same time to include their name together on the card and just address it to the two of them as a married couple. It\u2019s not even like he graduated and got a solo gift from his mother and then I graduated a few months later and she overlooked me. We could at least chalk it up to well she may have forgotten but no in this case we graduated at the same time and so this feels more purposeful like only her son\u2019s hard work matters and is being recognized and not her. At the very least if she wanted to give her son a separate card I dunno I couldn\u2019t get a small bouquet of flowers, a $20 gift card to a local coffee shop, a card with a handwritten note. Something? My parents treated us both equally and like a married unit when we graduated and my MIL was very much aware of that fact.  My question is AITA for stepping back from our relationship and being a little more cold to her now because I\u2019m seeing I\u2019m clearly not as important to her as I thought? I could be the AH for freezing her out without knowing what she did to bother me.",

        "selftext": "**AITI for not going and seeing my grandpa as per his dying wish?** This has been weighing on me, and I don\u2019t know if I made the right choice. My grandpa recently passed away, and before he died, he asked to see me one last time. I didn\u2019t go. To outsiders, my grandpa was a self-made multimillionaire, a hard worker who farmed, drove a bus for 59 years, and mowed lawns. He was respected in the community, but behind closed doors, it was a different story. My dad and his siblings were raised in an environment where success was expected, not celebrated. No \u201cI love you,\u201d no hugs, no recognition. My dad spent his life chasing approval that never came, which led to drinking and a failed marriage. By the time I was born, we were already the black sheep of the family. When my parents divorced, my grandpa used his money to make sure I stayed with my dad. For the first decade of my life, he was there for me. I thought he had my best interests at heart. But that changed when I got older. When I was in my early teens, my dad and I had to move. We were going to settle on a trailer, but my grandpa refused\u2014*No one in our family is going to live in a trailer.*\u00a0Instead, he bought a house for us. But that house wasn\u2019t a gift. It was control. For seven years, if we were late on rent, he\u2019d threaten to kick us out. One month, we were struggling, and I told him if we paid rent, we wouldn\u2019t have food or gas for two weeks. His response?\u00a0*\u201cIf you can\u2019t pay me, how am I supposed to eat for the next two weeks?\u201d*\u00a0A multimillionaire, telling two struggling people that our late rent would keep\u00a0*him*\u00a0from eating. And it wasn\u2019t just money. I love animals, especially cats. Every time I got one, it would disappear. Eventually, I found out he would take them while we were gone and\u00a0*\u201cdrop them off in the country.\u201d*\u00a0At least, that\u2019s what he claimed. This only stopped when laws changed. When he came for my cats\u2014ones I had for 10 years\u2014I told him,\u00a0*\u201cThey\u2019re neutered, declawed, and protected by law. If you take them, I\u2019ll file a report.\u201d*\u00a0He never touched them again. Then my dad died. Two years ago, my grandpa brought me to his grave. I tried to hug him. He stepped away. That was when I\u00a0*knew*\u2014the love my dad had spent his whole life chasing was never there. It never would be. Years passed, and then my grandpa was on his deathbed. He asked to see me one last time. And I didn\u2019t go. Maybe I should have. Maybe, despite everything, I owed him that. But after a lifetime of watching my dad break himself trying to earn the love that was never given, after years of being reminded that everything my grandpa did for us came with a cost, I couldn\u2019t do it. I just\u2026 couldn\u2019t. And now? He\u2019s gone, and I have to live with that decision. I don\u2019t know if I was justified or if I let my resentment get the best of me. I don\u2019t know if I should have swallowed my pride and gone, or if walking away was the only way to break the cycle.",

        "selftext": "So my roomie cooks A LOT and every time we run the dishwasher it's 95% their dishes and maybe 2-3 of mine. They also jam pack it full such that I get very nervous about breaking or scratching their (nice and probably expensive) dishes. It feels like playing dish Jenga every time. I want to note that part of my disability includes motor control and balance so I'm doubly afraid of that happening. Of note, my roommate is extremely organized and has a system for everything including dishes. I don't necessarily understand how they want their things stacked in the cupboard. There are heights involved that make me nervous as it is much harder to maintain balance and coordination when I'm reaching above me or trying to balance on a ladder. I am also just deeply traumatized by the sound of dishes clanging as, if I used to make audible noises I would get abused and I will never be 100% over that. I am not willing to tell this to them beyond this makes me viscerally uncomfortable but bc I only rarely touch them it's okay how it stands. It is minimal discomfort as is but that would be different if I had to get theirs, too. They typically just empty theirs and put the few that are mine on my pantry shelf. I am not exaggerating a bit when I say that it is 2 or 3 dishes. I mean 2 or 3. I only own one plate, two usable cups, two bowls, and two tupperware. I cannot recall a single time I washed all at once. Again, two or three things and I don't care how or even if they're put up. This time, I actually had like 5-6 dishes and a bunch of silverware so because it wasn't just a very small amount I decided to take mine out and not burden them with it. Well, I woke up to a text saying that leaving their load of dishes for them to put up themselves was rude and douchey. We agreed to handle our own dishes from now on, which means I will be putting up my 3 dishes. This is a nonproblem to me. Am I the asshole here for not putting theirs up? Why I may be the asshole: They usually put mine up even if it's 2 or 3 pieces. They may have seen me putting theirs up as the same amount of labor and therefore a favor I owe back to them. If this is the case then it would be rude for sure.",

Recently we\u2019ve been having some little problems here and there but nothing major.  This weekend, I am going to an event with him and some friends. Some of the female friends attending the event will be spending the night at my house the night of the event. My boyfriend had decided to stay the night with one of his friends as a result of this.  We had loosely discussed doing something together on Saturday after the event we are attending tomorrow. I expressed to him on the phone that I wanted to stay home instead of seeing him because i\u2019ve been backed up with school and work. We both have part time jobs and live 45 minutes away, so sometimes it\u2019s not a fun commute from one place to another.  He began to get very irritated with me because i was ultimately cancelling on him but still seeing my friends the same weekend. When i explained to him that i don\u2019t see these friends very often and it was the day before our event and i couldn\u2019t just cancel the plans he became even more upset towards me. He then hung up and continued to bug me about seeing him. I told him i felt as though he was being very inconsiderate and selfish, he has not talked to me since. I can very clearly see why he would be upset because i\u2019m cancelling our plans but i don\u2019t see why he thinks im being so rude for being tired and or stressed. So, WIBTA if i still attend the event and have my friends stay the night instead of strictly seeing my boyfriend?",

I send him my Wishlist so he can pick and it's still a surprise. *they have funky little designs. Worms, goblins, birds. Funky little stuff with pockets*So the package gets here and it's two tiktok cardigans.. they're cute.. but I'd never get them for myself.. I'm short and one is long, so it comes to my calves.. no pockets. The other is brown.. I dont own a single brown peice of clothing but the design is cute enough. I thought I acted happy. I was a little disappointed so I'm sure it showed but I tried them both on and said I loved them. It's really not a huge deal to me. But I guess I really hurt him.

He said he looked for a long time to find them for me.. aita",

        "selftext": "A little over 3 years ago, and coworker approached me and asked me to preserve some flowers from a funeral in resin. I had been working with resin for awhile, but had never done flowers, and was completely upfront with that information.  She said she understood the risks, wanted me to try anyways, and gave me a $100 deposit for supplies (I needed deep pour resin, molds, and silica gel powder), and said to keep it no matter what, just try my best. And I did. I literally tried everything. I did test flower after test flower, thought I had it, but I failed terribly when I went to do the actual flowers. I sent her a message, and never heard back. Then suddenly, today, I get a message from her, asking for the $100 for the flowers back, she could really use it... well, so did I, 3 years ago, when I spent that money, plus some, on the supplies. I'm actually kind of hurt, as I didn't think she was that kind of person. She did just retire, and is on a limited income. And she saw I just opened an online store for polymer clay. Maybe she thinks I'm doing better than I am? Well, I'm not. I'm operating at a loss, not her problem, but then again, I don't feel like her retirement situation is my problem. I was also out of work twice this year due to medical reasons,  a spinal fusion in my neck and a broken foot, and I've been out of work 2 other times for major surgeries in the last 3 years. I don't think I should be responsible for reimbursing her, especially after all this time. AiTA??",

        "selftext": "This situation took place over like 4 hours. It started at around 10 p, where I [M19] initially saw my girlfriend [F17] and everything was great, hugs, kisses, watching shows, etc. I had brought a small dessert for us to share, but she didn\u2019t like it, and she said she wanted pancakes. I was totally fine with the idea of getting pancakes, so I had agreed, and we went on as normal. Let\u2019s say maybe an hour or so went by, and we\u2019re in bed and she brought up how she was sad that I couldn\u2019t come see her yesterday. I reminded her that I had classes and I had to prioritize that first, and also said that if I had too much homework today, I probably wouldn\u2019t have been able to see her. She got mad at this and then started saying how she always puts aside so much work and that it shouldn\u2019t get in the way of me seeing her and that I could just do it at her house (keep in mind I am the only one who ever sees her or drives to see her). I told her that I understood to a certain extent, because she does pull all nighters to see me, but that the situation is different because all of my supplies are at my house, and then the situation kind of blew over but I could tell she was still mad. (I\u2019ve never not come to see her if I had a lot of homework, as I usually do it early, so the entire situation basically came from a \u201cwhat if\u201d). She was emotionless for the rest of the night, and then she told me she was going to do homework. I was left in the room for like an hour or two as she did her homework, which isn\u2019t something that is uncommon, but something that doesn\u2019t bother me. Then the pancakes came back\u2026 She had been emotionless initially from the small disagreement, but then she started asking for pancakes again. She wasn\u2019t asking like in the same attitude she was when she initially asked, just with her emotionless stare, begging and begging for pancakes. (I haven\u2019t went and got the pancakes by this point because she hadn\u2019t reminded me again until after the disagreement and by that point I kind of lost the urge to). She\u2019s done this before where she will beg for me to buy her things. The entire night she showed me no love, she\u2019d walk past me, she wouldn\u2019t even make eye contact with me, all while she was still asking for pancakes. I went into bed with her and told her that I didn\u2019t feel it was right for her to put me down for prioritizing school earlier and for basically ignoring me the entire time after over it and pancakes. She said that she was just so tired of this so tired of everything and that she was going to go to sleep and turned her back on me. At this point, I got up and told her that I was going to go home (3 am). I felt it was unfair that I wasn\u2019t being heard out and that I was also being ignored over pancakes\u2026 I feel like it may have not been the right thing for me to do, but after I left she stopped sharing her location, turned her read receipts off, and took me off her Instagram story.",

When it\u2019s clear that actually I\u2019m seeking acknowledgement of the pressure the current job puts on me and the kids. I will speak with him again to see how we can work through this.  Honestly I love that he loves his job, and 95% of the time it\u2019s fine for us as a family so I am not a total knob I promise!  Thanks for all your comments***********  So my partner works away 5 nights/days out of 7 leaving me to take on the bulk of the parenting and household duties, along with the usual day job, dog, and I also run my own business. Now, I am used to that, it\u2019s been that way our entire relationship, when he is home he is great and slots in perfectly.  He occasionally goes abroad for work, a few weeks at a time which obviously adds more pressure on to me to cover everything and needing more help from grandparents when I have work or my business etc etc. He is going away again soon, but this time will have two trips in quick succession, meaning I\u2019ll be on my own for a total of 4-5 weeks, I am so done! I am tired, and I miss him. I need him here and I hate this job of his, I really wish he would just quit(sadly not an option.) Now, AITA for wanting an apology from him or at least some form of grovelling haha. I know it\u2019s not in his control but I still feel an apology for putting me through all of this would help. I hold a lot of anger about these trips and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable here so please help! ",

        "selftext": "Here me out first before passing judgment. A few months ago, my grandfather turned 80. My brother and I have been living overseas for several years, and this was the first time in a few years that we were both back in town at the same time. As it coincided with our grandfather's birthday, our mother thought it would be great to have a birthday dinner to include my grandfather's children, grandchildren, and great grandchildren as well as their partners and family members, if any.  Since my uncle (grandfather's son) and his wife are usually the busiest, we let them decide the day and time on the one weekend when my brother and I were both in town. They chose Saturday dinner, which everyone then quickly confirmed through a family group chat. This was one month before the party. As the date had been set, I then planned my own time back in town accordingly. Nine days before my grandfather's party when I was back in town, my mother suddenly says that my uncle just messaged the group chat and changed the time to Saturday lunch because it was winter and cold and lunch time would be better for our grandfather. I told her that I was not free for lunch and that I was sure that my brother couldn't make it too, as he had just called me a few days earlier to make sure that our grandfather's party was indeed Saturday dinner. My mother quickly called my uncle to tell him that my brother and I couldn't make it. My uncle then got very angry and immediately said that he would cancel the dinner. 10 minutes later, he sends a message to the group chat saying that (and I quote) that \u201cDue to everyone having prior arrangement on such an important day for grandpa\u2019s birthday and can\u2019t make it to the event, we have decided to cancel the birthday celebration\u201d.  I quickly decided that I would still want to have dinner with my grandfather and confirmed it privately with everyone else, and everyone was fine with it. I then messaged the group chat the next day saying that I was still going ahead with the dinner and anyone who can make it can come and just let me know. I got radio silence from my uncle and his wife.  But AITA for not changing my plans so that the birthday party could be held at lunch? By the way, I thoroughly enjoyed the party and I assume everyone else did too because we didn't need to deal with my uncle and his wife's presence.",

        "selftext": "I (19F) draw. In 2023 I noticed I make more $ w/ furry art. Once I began learning to draw anthros, I made myself a fursona to help me practice. A year ago my lil bro (16M), who we'll call B wanted to make one too for funsies. I've posted lots of art of his sona on my Instagram since then w/o issue. On my art accounts I use a name that isn't mine irl. I do this for my/B's privacy. I've never mentioned B by name before. He's called brother & my followers are my own friends +strangers.He's told me he doesn't want his friends to see my furry art. He's embarrassed/ashamed of it. I'm comfortable with what I do tho & don't need validation from teens. B lives with my dad 3hrs away, none of our friends overlap, so my followers aren't a sign of mine/B's identity. Only way to find my account is to search for it directly or be following my main (which is private) & finding info about it there. B's friends can't see my account unless he shows them or they're already following it; which means they would know what I draw & are okay with furry art.Yesterday B's bestie saw a post on my art dump Snapchat story (which she joined of her own accord) about how I became a furry artist & today B's been ordering me to delete him from everything. He wants there to be no evidence of him on my Insta account in case his friend goes to snoop. He sent screenshots of posts he wanted edited, including one that wasn't even furry art; just an OC he'd made. I asked him why that one & he just insisted all evidence deleted. I argued that on all images of his sona he's not named (btw I have 3 bros so brother doesn't even directly implicate him). & that on most posts the descriptions just mention how he made critiques/suggestions on what to draw w/o any inclusion of the fact that the OCs are his.He said he told his bestie that he didn't know about the characters, so including him at all would get him in trouble. While arguing, I was still making the edits cause I do respect his privacy even if I think his reasoning is bs.I told him I deleted him but that next time he wants to order me around he has to pay me like everyone else; if he wants to make these demands & be the boss he has to hire me.He said wow, so now you don't even respect if people want to be anonymous for personal reasons?. That pissed me off. I told him that I do respect privacy & I have many people I mention using an alias for that very reason. What I don't appreciate is being ordered to go through a year's worth of posts & edit them because he's insecure & hateful. That up until now I had done all his art for free & I don't appreciate the bossy attitude & lack of respect for /me/. So again, if he wants that power, he can pay me for all future art just like everyone else.He thinks I'm being unreasonable/that I'm wrong for posting about him to begin with (tho he's never complained til now).Edit: I had his consent all long, he just freaked out & got demanding/rude today. tl;dr: bro bossed me around, I told him if he wants that privilege he needs to be a paying client.AITA?",

My wife (we are late 30s) has been going through some mental health issues and is has grown very codependent with me taking care of most everything in the household.  She will not travel for this funeral due to some social anxieties as well as fears and personal convictions about the current American climate and where the funeral will be.

She has become angry about my going stating that I have not prepared the family for an emergency like this and that I have not supported her or acknowledged her needs and fears in this when I feel like I have. She feels that I should put our relationship and needs above all else at all times and I am being unreasonable pushing for this trip when it could cause her emotional harm.

My husband does not currently have a steady job but does work about once maybe twice a week we both get Social Security and pay rent 50-50 and are responsible for our own phone bills. We have a four-year-old little girl who is in preschool as well as daycare when we decided I was gonna be at stay mom we sat down and talked about with the rules were going to be. I was going to handle any of the major household cleaning cooking stuff like that and majority of childcare related stuff, he of course, still does help more often. Now that he doesn\u2019t have a job but to get the issue we agreed on this we agreed that people would still be responsible for cleaning up after themselves their own trash stuff like that. I have taught our daughter that she is supposed to put her plate in a sink and sweep and wipe down the table when she is done eating as well as lately she has shown interest in doing things like helping feed our cats or clean their litter box and stuff like that, but the part that is driving me crazy is both my husband and my daughter will open Food rappers and stuff and just throw the rappers on the floor not pick up after themselves. My daughter has ADHD and we\u2019re working right now on her ability to finish incomplete one task at a time but with my husband it\u2019s really frustrating. I go around the house every single day and I collect cereal bowls in places other than the sink and he adds sugar to his cereal bowl so then they\u2019ve been sitting out all day and now it\u2019s crusted with milk and sugar, the other thing that drives me crazy is his side of the bed is literally a trash heap. I plan on having a family meeting with them today once everybody gets home and I\u2019m gonna let them know that going forward when I\u2019m around the house cleaning if I find anything where it doesn\u2019t belong or on the floor and I\u2019ve already asked for it to be picked up once and it\u2019s not.

I was genuinely interested in a new one because can\u2019t stand my old old one because the smell brings me back to memories of an incredibly hard time in my life, and I associate my old one with a past relationship. But I had restocked recently and been gifted so I was dead set on not buying anyone for years tbh.But flash forward and for our 6 month anniversary my boyfriend got me the same perfume as my best-friend. Which i thought was incredibly sweet because he didn\u2019t have to do something so big for a 6 month anniversary but he wanted to, and because he remembered that one time i mentioned how much I liked it. It really was the cherry on top of an amazing weekend and I was really excited about it and our relationship in general.Until, my best friend found out and is actually quite upset. She says she \u2018doesn\u2019t even want hers anymore\u2019 and said I should\u2019ve returned it (my boyfriend opened it for me to it\u2019s not returnable). I completely understand wanting a \u2018signature sent\u2019 (a phenomenon i think like most, my boyf has no clue exists) and would\u2019ve never have gone out of my way to buy it. However, I was gifted it, and it was a really sweet meaningful gift to me. I feel like it\u2019s kind of fucked up to insist I return the gift, not to mention I was having a very hard night (computer broke and missed a v important academic deadline) when the topic arose. I feel like it\u2019s a little understandable to a bit upset, but not to demand I return it and then go silent and passive aggressive, when i\u2019m already having a hard time. I feel like it kinda lends itself to a broader theme lately of her treating me unkind. Am I crazy for feeling that way? Am I the Asshole?",

He recently got his first job, which is part time and just a few hours each week. His dad and I cover all household expenses/food and he has considerable savings as I (and other family members) have always given him money. These savings enabled him to go to on an exotic holiday last year. I often don't ask about his life, or job, as I know he doesn't like to share things and, out of respect for his privacy, I never go in his room. He has friends in another town he regularly visits, and his dad usually drives him to and from the train station. Last week he went to a conference with a friend. He asked me to iron his shirt for him (which I did). After a couple of days I asked him if he'd had a good time. He said 'yes'. I then asked if there'd been food at the conference or stalls ('no' and 'no') and went on to ask if his friend knew anyone there ('I don't remember') or if he'd spoken to anyone there ('I don't remember'). I got upset and told him that if he didn't want to answer he could, at least, be gracious with his non answers and also that I felt there was no give and take in our relationship. My son has told me that as I persisted in asking questions when he clearly didn't want to answer I don't care about him. I think this is unfair. AITA? ",

        "selftext": "So this is my 8th pregnancy.. Yes I know it's a lot lol. I have never had a baby shower thrown for me. My mom never cared enough to do one and I don't have friends. I've always wanted to do one so I figured this year I could do one with my kids and my husband. Nothing real formal just maybe a cake and a day at Dave and busters or something like that. My husband was so happy he of course told his coworkers about the pregnancy. They congratulated him and offered said they would love to throw me a baby shower. Apparently they started planning right away and requested I make a registry at Amazon. I honestly didn't feel comfortable with that, I am just grateful for anything I get. They planned for it to be at the office which is a funeral home. That part does bother me a little, what really bothers me are his coworkers. My husband often comes home and complains about the way they treat him and his staff. From our experience the office staff at funeral homes never respect the guys working outside. Anyhow I told my husband that I don't feel comfortable going because I don't actually know them. What I do know about them is what he has told me and they don't seem very nice. He rolled his eyes and was like  who cares, it's a chance to get free stuff. I still didn't feel comfortable but I said I'd go with him. My husband then told me he wasn't going to be there and I immediately said I'm not going. I appreciate that he wanted to do something for me but him not being there was a deal breaker. It's been two weeks and he asked about it and I just asked him to thank them for the thought but if rather do something with just my family. He really wants me to go but I really don't want to. So would I be a jerk for not going? ",

I (19m) was at what i wouldve considered my main friend group if you asked me a month ago, I was already pissed off cause one of them stole something from me but I didn\u2019t know who so i looked at the guy who\u2019d asked to borrow it from me which what any person would do i think. Anyway i decided to forget it and just get drunk. Here comes the kicker, i had been invited to a party by some other people and it was relatively early so i thought why not? But we\u2019re a pretty tight group its just us we don\u2019t really go out with other people so i turned my location off for them. I had one drink at their place and then I went on my merry way. Then I got a text today saying i was an asshole this that for leaving them and lying saying i was gonna go home. So i told him that I went for one drink and he shouldn\u2019t be so dramatic because he told me us or them. He wouldnt listen and asked me again so I said you\u2019re not gonna tell me who i can talk to or not i dont give a fuck whether you like them or not I can have my own opinion. I mean they always bully me, destroy my shit or steal my shit and i was sick and tired of being treated that way and I dont like to fight so i just left.

        "selftext": "So a few weeks ago my family had a huge fight. Nothing physical but very verbal and rude. My Dad is trying to start a business I really didn't want to be apart of be abuse of past failed business ventures as well as in my opinion my Dad's poor work ethic as it concerns businesses he starts.  Start of issue: Anyway I went to see a client one day and I did my role like I was supposed to however there was one more thing that was supposed to be on the contract (it wasn't there) but needed to be noted. As well a piece involving a certain amount of money on the contract. That aspect is not my job. My father while not the best with work he knows how to take care of his clients aka making things easy for them. My brother on the other hand is very much, the client can fill that out. Well my father tried to speak with my brother and he was being very rude by just walking away. This is not new behavior he's been like this for years. Things escalated to the point of my father and brother yelling at each other, my mother starting to yell stop, and me coming out my room and yelling stop. In which my brother then tried to verbally attack me and I ended it with me calling him a b*tch.  This definitely wasn't my best moment and moments like this, and some in the past is why I didn't want to work with my family in the first place.  Anyway to my posed question... I apologized an in doing so I pointed out the differences in how my brother was raised versus me. My grandmother had a very big influence in my life. My Mom had cancer when I was 2 so my grandmother was there for a vast majority of my childhood to help out. As well as me being raised with different values than my brother. Either way now my mother and brother are upset with me because of what I stated which mind you has been said to me from my mother, it's been stated by my father, so this is not a family secret. I told him I'm going to just mind my business when they're arguing because the things they argue with him about inadvertently they raised him to have those values. I.e. a relationship with God but as a child pulling him from church on Sundays for games and birthday parties. Or how he speaks to my parents but his friends also spoke that way to their parents and they never redirected him to a different friend group. Certain things like that we were raised completely opposite.  Either way my brother isn't talking to me still and my Mom while she I'd talking to me I feel like it was very corny of my brother to share what I said to him with our parents. Anyway am I the A.H.? More detail, I'm (30F) and my brother is (24M). FYI I wanted to share images of the text messages but couldn't. Sorry guys.",

I have locs and haven't had the time for a retwist so I just told her I'm gonna twist it this week. She then says that I'm only wearing half a shirt. I was wearing a crop top and thought she was making a joke so I laughed it off and left to go finish running errands. Today I called and asked her if I could come in to get some bloodwork done (she is a nurse and I need a TB test for a job application). She told me I could as long as I didn't look a mess like last time. I was confused and asked what was wrong with my outfit to which she replied that it wasn't appropriate for her work. She said that my clothes were inappropriate, my hair was a mess, and it made me look dirty. I acknowledged that my hair wasn't done and then asked what was wrong with my outfit: a crop top and cargo pants. She told me that the look didn't reflect on her as my parent. I told her that I had dressed with her in mind: I wore a bra, no crazy makeup, and even wore the shoes she got me because I know she hates my favorite pair; but it still wasn't good enough for her. She holds me to too high of a standard that I don't ever expect to meet and I'm tired. She responded by saying that she holds all of her children to high standards because that's her job as a parent.  This is when I kinda lost it. My mom had me at 17 and I have never lived with her. I was raised by my great grandparents and although we have a rocky relationship, they have more claim as a parent than she does. I told her that she doesn't have the right to parent me and that anything I do reflect more on my great grandparents than her. This isn't the first time we've had an argument similar to this but for some reason I'm more angry than usual. To say that I look dirty and that it reflects poorly on her as a parent is absolutely wild to me especially given our relationship. ",

Jake loves giving hugs and being otherwise very physically affectionate with all of his friends and I\u2019m not at all comfortable with physical contact due to personal reasons. We\u2019ve tried other solutions like using a hugging emoji instead because he feels like by not being outwardly affectionate he\u2019s not being himself at all. The hugging emoji started being worked into every text all the time and it began to make me increasingly uncomfortable and Jake unfortunately picked up on it. He got really upset with me and said that it\u2019s really unfair to him that I can\u2019t be more affectionate especially since I\u2019ve been really busy with work and other things lately as we haven\u2019t been able to hang out much. I honestly agree I feel like he\u2019s been trying to be someone he\u2019s not to make me comfortable but I don\u2019t know how to make myself more comfortable with either the emoji or physical contact.

I have epilepsy and no medication, i panic and don't think much of the missed bus stop, sometimes it happens, i figure it's no big deal. i figure i'd get another bus back. all i can think of is how much time i have left to get my medication. the bus driver pulled me aside at the next stop, yells at me, and says that i missed the bus stop on purpose, i said i'd pay the difference, but he says he can't do that. i don't know what to say. i said I'm sorry but you were going so fast and i saw my pharmacy was closed, i panicked and was looking for open pharmacies on google.  i figure i'd get another bus into town to get an emergency prescription, lo and behold, same bus driver. he says to me, and i quote, you have some nerve getting onto my bus again. i looked at him and said i said i would pay the difference. he goes you know you can't. i said i'll pay it right now, add it on to my ticket i'm paying for. he sighs, shakes his head, and then calls me a liar and a cheater. it is a 40p difference in ticket by the way. i told him he was being unnecessarily hostile and rude and i left before it turned into a yelling match because he just seemed in the mood to pick fights, i went upstairs.  he proceeds to rant about me to another man who asked what happened so loudly that the entire bus can hear, he calls me a liar and a cheater again. tells the man i swindled him on purpose because i missed my bus stop, and cost the bus company 40p.  am i the asshole? i am genuinely unsure because his reaction was so severe it made me feel like i'd done something wrong.

        "selftext": "For some context, I am still in school and we have the option to order lunch from the cafeteria. One of our close friends sits at our table and gets school lunch every day. He often / almost always gets ketchup with his lunch. I my whole life have been extremely disgusted by ketchup. I honestly couldn\u2019t tell you why, I have no issue with tomato\u2019s, In fact    I love tomatoes. Him having ketchup doesn\u2019t bother me in the slightest, but my other friends who sit at the table like to play jokes on me by smearing ketchup on me and my food. I have always expressed how much this upsets me as my as they like to say \u201cfear\u201d of ketchup isn\u2019t a joke. It genuinely fucks with me and to an extent can make me lose my appetite if it\u2019s smeared on me or my food. On Friday my friend (the one wearing the scuba) decided it would be a fun Idea to play one of these jokes on me. Her and another friend who sit with us often bring fun or ethnic candy / foods to lunch. In her hand, she had a green grape covered in a reddish / pink coating and said \u201cthis grape is really crunchy\u201d she hadn\u2019t played any jokes on me recently and knowing her liking for cool foods, I assumed it was tanghulu (if you don\u2019t know, tanghulu is a fruit in a crunchy sugar coating) another fact is she had the grape in her hand, making me assume the coating was solid. With all this in mind, I took the grape unsuspectingly when I then felt the liquidy feeling on my hands, immediately alerting me that the thing on the grape was in fact ketchup. I was extremely upset by this as I have previously stated they know things like this make me lose my appetite. I have never retaliated towards these jokes before as I always thought they didn\u2019t realize the extent of my distaste. But I was proven wrong when I realized she felt like she had to lie to me to get me to accept anything with ketchup on it. It made me realize she fully knew how much it upset me. In an admittedly immature mix of anger and disgust, I threw the grape at her. It landed in her hair then tumbled onto her scuba. She flipped out to say the least. I got up calmly and walked over to the paper towels to wipe off my hand. While I was up there she came back up to me and smeared ketchup on my white sweater. I still kept calm as I don\u2019t want to continue the immature back and forth that\u2019s going on. I redirect myself to the bathroom where I attempt to wash the stain of my sleeve. She completely thinks I\u2019m the asshole because her scuba was \u201cmore expensive\u201d than my sweater. She even said \u201cMines Lululemon and yours is from where? Old navy?\u201d  (It\u2019s from American eagle and says American eagle in big letters on the front) I truly want feedback and want to know if I\u2019m the asshole in this situation. I would again like to reiterate that my thing with ketchup isn\u2019t a joke and it\u2019s a genuine thing that disgusts me. So, let me know.",

I have a job, I pay my bills, I put in for the rent, and I try my best to be responsible.  I also want to put it out there that I am in a family who uses Life360, as a way of \u201csecurity to make sure we\u2019re doing alright.\u201d But I know damn well that it makes it difficult for me to be free and go places without people knowing.  So I decide to treat myself to a tattoo, because I feel like I deserve it after all the hard work I put in at my job. It makes me happy, and I want it to get through the mental turmoil I am getting from what is going on in the world.  However, I still feel like I need to tell my parents what I am doing. This is something I SHOULDN\u2019T be doing because I am an adult. They don\u2019t need to know if and/or when I am getting a tattoo. If it was me, I\u2019d turn Life360 off. It\u2019s so much that it has become a heavy weight on me that I can\u2019t get off until I tell my parents. And so I did.  I told them straight up that I already made the appointment, placed the deposit, and financed it. I have been met with my mother crying again. With previous tattoos she asks me why I am investing so much. Now she asks me \u201cwhat is going on in your head??\u201d It felt like she was asking \u201cwhat is wrong with you\u201d for wanting my arms covered. She didn\u2019t talk to me for the rest of the day.  My dad then comes and then asks me to \u201creconsider the date and push it further because that way my mother won\u2019t feel bad anymore\u201d This comment triggered me because it comes off that I can\u2019t do something for ME to be stable and happy, but I have to fold for others to make THEM stable and happy. Or that my decisions and choices are too much when already I am doing stuff and even more at my job.  So I am struggling to confidently say that I will proceed with my appointment because there is that lingering guilt of hurting my parents. But I in good faith cannot bend my arm to please others because I am doing that every day. For making that decision and \u201crebelling\u201d against them, AITA?",

I (18f) have known my brother\u2019s (34 m) girlfriend (24f) for about 7 years. Her and her family usually come over to spend the holidays at our house, since my brother and I both live with our parents. For a bit of context, I have a pretty healthy relationship with my brother and we hang out about once a week. Similarly to most little sisters, I tend to tease him and my other older brother every now and then, which is all in good fun. As for my relationship with his girlfriend, it\u2019s pretty neutral since neither of us seem to care much about one another. I respect her as my brother\u2019s lover, but I wouldn\u2019t really consider her a personal friend due to how little we interact outside of family gatherings. This Chinese New Year, I decided to mess with my older brother. Our mother had asked me to text my brother to see when he was coming over, which I decided to get creative with. It was a very short and informal text, essentially teasing him by saying something along the lines of \u201cYou and (other brother) are lazy as hell, OP\u2019s really clutching up for CNY by making all the food while yall just sit on yalls phones,, when ya getting here btw lmao?\u201d and that was it. (Sorry for the informality, I wanted to replicate the message as closely as possible for clarification purposes)  It was a really short text with what I would consider to be regular teasing that I tried to make very obviously a joke and as my texting style, so I didn\u2019t think much of it when I sent it. My brother showed up a bit late to dinner while his girlfriend and her family were nowhere to be found. He explained to me that she went through his phone and saw the text message, got upset, and decided not to come over to dinner with her family last minute. She later called our mom during dinner and was crying over the phone (which I heard, since our mom had her on speakerphone). She was saying something about how she thought I hated her, which our mom had left the table to console her about.  Now my brother is asking me to apologize to her for the message. I\u2019ll do it for sure, since I felt bad hearing her cry and watching our mom leave the table to console her over the phone. However, this request confused me quite a bit since I never once mentioned her in that message I sent, nor did I send it to her in the first place.  For clarification, only my brother\u2019s girlfriend is upset about this. My brothers both laughed it off and assured me neither of them cared, since my brother immediately knew the message was from me and was me joking around.  Anyways, AITA for making my brother\u2019s girlfriend cry by teasing him?",

        "selftext": "Hi. 18M. So, my family is tense right now. My younger half sister (13F) has gotten to the age where she is being quite rebellious. She\u2019s popular at school, and does well socially. The problem is, she\u2019s become an asshole at home. One this about me is that I have OCD and I\u2019m autistic. When it comes to food, I need everything to be clean and can be quite obsessive. I wash my hands frequently, and must ensure that cutlery and dishes are spotless before I use them. I make all my own meals because I don\u2019t like people touching my food. Okay- now onto the main bit. My sister has recently started doing incredibly disgusting things in the kitchen. Some examples:- Scooping out Nutella with her bare hands- Putting DIRTY cutlery BACK in the cutler drawer on the clean stuff- Putting used and dirty dishes on the clean stuff- Putting dirty cutlery in the clean dishwasher This hasn\u2019t happened once or twice. I\u2019d say this has happened over 20 times in the last six months and it\u2019s really upsetting me. I was always the black sheep of the family, and bullied quite a lot. If I bring up stuff like this I get called mean names. Today was a bit of a breaking point for me. I woke up, and went to empty the dishwasher. In the clean cutlery section, there was a dirty knife put on the clean ones. On top of that, there was a used cereal bowl put at the top, so all the excess milk spilt out on the clean ones. This really, upset me. I\u2019ve tried telling my mom to be stricter, and less relaxed about this stuff, but every time I do I get told I\u2019m being an asshole because my sister is \u2018still learning\u2019 or something like that, and that she \u2018has hormones\u2019 and that causes her to be more difficult.  I get it. I get that she\u2019s at an age where she\u2019s probably most rebellious and least thoughtful, but this stuff genuinely really upsets me. 2024 I experienced severe stomach problems due to stress, anxiety, and the fear of throwing up, and through therapy I\u2019m trying to do more behaviour experiments to help OCD- but stuff like this just validates my fears. I\u2019m trying so hard to move out. Am I being an asshole? Am I being to harsh? It feels like my sister is treated as the favourite. I have an older brother (25M) who moved out a few years ago, and me and him had a lot stricter rules. Imo the stuff she\u2019s doing is disgusting and unacceptable. I get she\u2019s only 13 but at that age I would have never even fathomed doing stuff like that- because it\u2019s not only gross but puts other people at risk. I feel really upset.  If this happened once or twice I\u2019d be more understanding, but this genuinely happens so frequently it\u2019s insane. Also, she\u2019s just as unthoughtful in other places- so many times I\u2019ve gone to take a shower to find it covered in hair product and hair. I\u2019m trying to be patient and understanding but I can\u2019t.",

        "selftext": "Hi, so today I (16F) was working on some English homework in my room when my mom (46F) came in. For some context, my family is Muslim, and my mother is extremely religious to a point the rest of us are not. Regardless, I still complete the five daily prayers every day to avoid her getting mad at me, because if I stop, it could result in her pulling me out of school and trying to marry me off, as she's threatened to do. My mom is known among my sister, my father, and I to be narcissistic and emotionally immature, but she refuses to get help or accept that she has a problem. We just put up with her behavior all the time, but sometimes I snap a bit. My mom was telling me that I need to complete the night prayers right after we eat dinner so she can watch me pray and see that I'm actually doing it. I responded that I do pray but I do it before I go to sleep because I'm usually right in the middle of something before dinner and want to finish it up. She began saying that she doesn't hear me get out of bed to pray at night and she doesn't believe that I actually do it. I told her I'm not sure why she doesn't hear me because I do get up and pray, but she kept accusing me of lying. I was in the middle of trying to finish this assignment and I was frustrated that she was making it *my* problem that *she* can't hear me. I asked her if she wants me to be louder or something and she said No, I just want you to tell me why I can't hear you, and I want you to actually pray. I got fed up and here's where I may be TA. I told her (politely but firmly) that I was done with this conversation because it wasn't going anywhere and asked if she could leave me alone so I could work. She kept nagging me to answer her question and told me I can't ask her to leave whenever I feel like it, and I responded by telling her that I already answered her question and she was distracting me and there was no point in continuing the conversation when she wasn't listening to me. I then reminded her that she does this all the time, comes in my room and starts accusing me of things and doesn't listen to my side of the argument, & why should we have more conversations like this when we already know how it's going to go? She tearfully told me that if I don't want her in my room she'll leave, and I politely responded, Oh, okay, you can leave then. She yelled, You don't want me in your room? Fine, write it down then. This is the last time I'm ever stepping foot in your room. She proceeded to slam the door extremely hard and hasn't spoken to me since. It's true that I was annoyed with my mom for accusing me of lying and repeating the same things over and over again. I feel like her slamming the door so hard and having that reaction to a pretty reasonable request was a bit of an overreaction, but I'm worried asking her to leave me alone was too harsh. However, I didn't say anything in a rude or yelling tone, I tried my best to maintain my composure and say everything calmly. AITA? ",

        "selftext": "Backstory: My older sister has been single for over a decade and the past few years has been basically in love with her mutual friend for several years, but he's been engaged to another woman for the past 2 years. Over the holidays he emotionally cheated on his fianc\u00e9e (did sexual stuff online with a stranger) and she understandably broke up with her and ended their engagement over this past New Year's. After the breakup, my sister met up with him as a friend to hear about the breakup and hang out, but I guess once they did that, he suddenly started to develop feelings for my sister and now they're basically dating but not officially yet.  She told me that he struggles with his mental health and he's seeing a therapist and on medication now, and she told me that he SAID he wanted to take 3-4 months off dating but now over only a few hangouts, him and my sister are basically together now which I feel like is SO fast and this man really moved quickly. I want to be happy for my sister because she is finally with the guy she likes a lot, but it feels icky how fast this all happened, especially because he was the cheater in the last relationship.. My cousin is getting married March 15 and now she wants to bring this new guy to the wedding. \ud83d\ude43 The wedding is here in FL where I live and my sister lives in Virginia, and usually when she visits I let her stay in the guest room and in my condo with my husband and I. But now that she is insisting on bringing him to the wedding, regardless of whether my cousin can accommodate him or not at the actual wedding, he is still coming with her to visit my whole family for the first time. I feel like all of this is happening way too fast, maybe it's just me because I have a hard time with change, but am I an asshole if I don't feel comfortable letting her and her extremely new boyfriend stay at my place?

        "selftext": "My sister wants to build a startup and has continued to ask me for help due to the professional skills I have that would aid her in getting the business off the ground. I have done side projects with her in the past, which had largely consisted of me attempting to teach her my skill set. I can get short when teaching others, if I get the impression that they are not truly putting in a genuine amount of time and effort to learn what I\u2019m teaching. I experienced this with her when she was not meeting up regularly to do work on the project and then requesting that I bring her up to speed when it was convenient to her. These projects all ended the same way, the working relationship broke down and then I finished out the project on my own. My sister has asked once again for my aid, this time not just a project but to get a full company up and running. I had initially refused stating that we are just not compatible business partners. This was met with an angry response and many personal attacks that placed blame on me for the break down of the past projects. Fast forward a little more and she has moved past my initial rejection and is attempting to ask for help again. I have at this point said I\u2019m not interested in the work or undertaking the risk associated with joining a startup. This was met with the ultimatum of \u201cif you refuse there\u2019s no second chance, if I make it don\u2019t come crawling to me asking to get in on the success\u201c. To which I replied that I understood and need more time to think, knowing that an outright refusal would result in another heated argument. The root of the \u201cAITAH\u201d is that any time I refuse, there\u2019s a clear emotional reaction. I would expect someone to approach recruiting anyone, family or otherwise, with a professional and courteous demeanor. But that\u2019s not what I\u2019m experiencing. Perhaps I\u2019m being emotional? Perhaps me saying I need to think rather than outright refusing for a final time is me being an asshole? There\u2019s probably a lot of missing context here so please feel free to ask questions.",

        "selftext": "Two of my friends are going on a weekend trip to another state. They had already booked to go together before I even agreed to go, and were happy to split the cost between the two of them. They then asked if I would want to go (this MORNING) and I said yes at the time because I didn't really think it through and it was a spontaneous decision. They called me tonight and we booked train tickets, and the hotel is payable when we arrive but we said we would just split the cost after. They talked about what they plan on doing whilst there and it's a big weekend of clubbing and drinking and after thinking about it I've decided that I just really don't want to go- I'm not in the position to be spending lots of money and partying just isn't my scene anymore. I've cancelled on the last few weekends out too because I haven't wanted to party hard and they just don't understand and have got really angry at me for being flakey and now saying they're left with having to pay for the hotel. Should I just suck it up and go given that I'm young and should just enjoy myself- or go with my instinct and have the weekend in like I enjoy?   To clarify: They were going regardless. They decided and booked the hotel BEFORE i was involved. they asked me, i said yes which was a rushed decision. On our call- they said they wanted to party really hard and i dont. that made me rethink- and since i've been stressed about that and money. The train tickets have nothing to do with me dropping out, they have their own tickets and like i said..they were going in the first place as just the 2 of them!",

I have told him before that I don\u2019t want to cut his hair, I have done it before and it\u2019s never something he ends up liking. Since the last time I cut it I told him, I am not going to cut your hair to avoid any issues. It\u2019s been months since his last hair cut, I have told him before to go look for someone professional to cut his hair, he refuses to look and drive far to get a hair cut. All the other times I have had to find a place for him to get his hair cut and sometimes the people that cut his hair he doesn\u2019t want to go back to either because of bad service or he ended up getting cut (ex. The back of his neck nipped) and I understand some reasons but I have told him to look for someone he would like to go see if he should check it out. Well last time I cut it, it was to long it wasn\u2019t what he wanted, this time it was to short. I am not a professional, this isn\u2019t a hobby I want to do this isn\u2019t something. I don\u2019t know how to cut hair and I really didn\u2019t want to do it the reason I did it this time was because we are low on money and can\u2019t pay anyone to cut his hair we barely have enough for food atm, I have also told him that he should cut his hair so I don\u2019t have but he hasn\u2019t tried. So I want to know AITAP.S. I didn\u2019t mean to cut his hair to short he claims I did it on purpose. When I told him I was trying to get it even.Edit; I take back that he hasn\u2019t cut his hair, he did it once and messed up bad, he was frustrated that I was to slow (first time cutting his hair) and he got the clippers and started to cut his own hair, safety guard fell off in the process and from then on hasn\u2019t tried to cut his hair because he had to go bald that time and still got upset with me for being to slow.",

        "selftext": "I (21F) and my partner (22M) have been together for almost 5 years. We had mutual friends through school, so we\u2019ve basically grown up together. For extra context, I\u2019m autistic. I need structure and I like having things sorted way ahead of time. My partner is not, he just tends to \u2018go with the flow\u2019. Going on vacation together has always been a goal of ours. We were both absolutely certain we wanted to go on vacation in summer 2025. I brought up that we should get looking ASAP if we wanted a better variety of places to choose from within our budget. We both agree.  Throughout January, I\u2019m sending him links, sites, deals - all of which meets our \u2018list\u2019 of what we\u2019re looking for. He says yes to every one of them which I found odd. Surely you\u2019d have some preference, right? I assume he\u2019s eager to go and genuinely likes them all. Bare in mind we are both paying 50/50.  By the end of January, we still haven\u2019t booked because he keeps leaving things until last minute like telling his boss he\u2019ll need time off.I call him out on this as I\u2019m getting a little anxious, majority of the places we liked were now at capacity so those were off the table. I\u2019m worrying we won\u2019t find somewhere we both like if we don\u2019t get it booked soon and that he doesn\u2019t actually want to go anymore. He repeatedly assures me he wants to go and that he\u2019ll get it sorted with his boss, and he does - or so he says. Come February, we finally find our ideal place and book it, we\u2019re excited. A few days after, he says he\u2019s going to have to reschedule our vacation dates due to something at work.  This gets me angry. I told him beforehand that I cannot reschedule my time off work like he can, hence the \u2018nagging\u2019 him previously. I work for a big company, often short staffed and cannot take annual leave if someone else is off work at the same time, whereas he works in a quiet local bar in a small town mostly targeted at older people. After talking, he hadn\u2019t told his boss we\u2019d booked it, only that he was wanting to have time off around summertime and was looking into a vacation. He hadn\u2019t told or confirmed with his boss the dates we were looking at before we booked it, nor did he let him know as soon as we\u2019d booked it. He\u2019d left things until last minute again. To add, the rescheduling is because his boss is having a dispute with another business and it got moved. On occasions leading up to this, his boss has repeatedly said that it isn\u2019t important that my partner be the and is solely a preference because they are friends.  I told him I won\u2019t be going on vacation with him at all now because he refuses to prioritise things properly. If I can\u2019t trust him to complete simple tasks, then I can\u2019t trust him enough to fly to a different country with him, keeping in mind we have never travelled without our families before. I understand that he should be there for his boss, but he should\u2019ve confirmed these dates with him ASAP and take it seriously.AITA for being too extreme?",

        "selftext": "My boyfriend (23) and I (female, 24) met at our corporate job. We hit it off immediately and started dating. Although it might seem odd, this was my first dating experience. In the beginning, he was incredibly sweet, caring, and attentive. He often brought me snacks and cooked meals for me, and I reciprocated as much as I could. While I appreciated his attention, I also wanted to take care of him and show my affection, so I occasionally bought him small gifts. Initially, he was emotional and happy about them. However, over time, he began to criticize the gifts I gave him, calling them useless and not what he wanted. For his birthday, I bought him a childhood game he had mentioned he never got to play but still felt nostalgic about. I thought it would be a thoughtful gift to fulfill his childhood dream, and I added some expensive snacks. He seemed joyful at first, but the next day, he shamed me for it, comparing my gift unfavorably to an even more expensive gift from his best friend. He called my gift childish and useless, gave it to his nephew, and said he couldn't eat the snacks, so he gave them to his brothers. I felt very upset and explained my intentions, but I didn't want to let him control my mood, so I brushed it off and tried to forget about it. After this incident, I became discouraged from buying him anything. One day, I noticed that the calluses on his hands were getting worse, so I bought him weightlifting gloves. As soon as he saw them, he commented on how ugly they were and insisted I should return them. I was just trying to be thoughtful, and I never expected such a reaction. I felt so disappointed, but again, I brushed it off and stopped gifting him anything. For context, he only gave me a gift once, and that was on my birthday. I'm not trying to shame him, but I wish he would consider my thoughtfulness when I buy him things. Even if he didn't like them, he could at least pretend and not put me down. Now, with Valentine's Day approaching, I feel so discouraged from buying him anything. ",

I am also quite handy around the house and don't mind rolling up my sleeves to get dirty, so I also snake any drains when they get clogged up. (Sinks, showers, etc.) This is a skill that I have taught myself out of necessity. It's not something we specifically discussed as being my chore/obligation, but I took it on to be helpful and do my part because we are a team.  That said...He is a man and shaves his face. He does this over his bathroom sink, of course, and makes minimal effort to prevent his trimmings and shaving products from going down the drain even though I have asked him to do better many times. Predictably, his sink needs to be snaked every few months because he has clogged it up yet again. I have taken care of this every time so far, albeit begrudgingly. Anyone who has performed this task will understand just how putrid and vile it can be in there. I am getting tired of cleaning up an easily preventable mess and am refusing to snake his sink this time. I told him he should take care of it, but it remains unaddresed several weeks later. Mind you, he doesn't know how to do it and I have offered to teach him. I am attempting the teach our kid this as well, because it is a life skill.  Also relevant: we have been in our home for like 14 years and I have never had to snake my bathroom sink and have had to snake our shower exactly one time (I do my best to collect my hair and throw it away to prevent it from clogging the drain). I feel like he is a grown ass man who is capable of cleaning up after himself and him refusing to do so is not something I should be punished for.  I also acknowledge that since I have been doing this task that there is a reasonable expectation for me to continue doing it, but this is above and beyond occasional clogs from normal use.  Sooo...

It hasn't been verified but this guy is clearly autistic, but so was the roommate he replaced but we never had any issues with him.Anyways I DEEP cleaned the main areas before he moved in, and within the week after it was trashed. Milk was constantly being left out, he was taking dirty dishes OUT of the sink and spreading them across the counter spaces. On top of that he REFUSED to talk to or even look at us.Me and my other roommate got tired of this and we warned him if he keeps leaving all his stuff out, we were just going to start putting his stuff in his room for him to deal with. For the most part things got better, but he was still leaving stuff out a LOT. It was just usually taken care of by the end of the day.But one day, I noticed an OPEN jar of mayo, an OPEN pack of cheese, and an OPEN pack of ham. We don't share stuff like that so I just shrugged it off because I was in a rush to go to my girlfriend's place. I actually messaged him about it, and I said he needed to put it up, and if he didn't he was going to get sick. Well going into the third day, it was still there. He wasn't, and his door was wide open, so I closed the items, put it on his desk and walked out.THREE days later, he comes to me and says did you go into my room and put this stuff here? My room is a barrier that I want to be respected this is the first time if heard him say this and I did feel bad for doing it, but to my knowledge we were all on the same page.One random story I have of him that's kinda the same topic... he half cooked a chicken, turned off the pan, and went to class... he just... left the chicken... half cooked idk I thought that one was gross",

        "selftext": "One of my close friends, Mitch, left a set of items at my house several years ago when they initially moved out. When I had first bought they and their family lived in the upstairs half of my house. With them they brought along their first set of table and chairs from their first apartment. It's not an heirloom or anything, it's one of those starter sets from Walmart but it's decent wood and metal and it's got sentimental value to them. When they first moved into another apartment on their own about 2-3 years they brought the table, but left 3/4 chairs with me because they didn't have room. They later moved into a larger apartment last year and still haven't taken the chairs. We use them from time to time, it's not like they sit up in an attic, but they are more temporary extra seating than actively part of our decor. They stay in our dining room which has terrible heating and I accidentally left one close to a window and it got really damp and eventually molded all over the seat (the metal was okay). I noticed when I was spring cleaning the dining room and I tried to clean the seat but I couldn't figure out how to get it off and ultimately threw it away, thinking they wouldn't want it back in that state and I still had the other two. They have a new table and chairs set at their current home so if they ever actually want them back these would likely serve the same purpose in their life as my own. This was a few months ago, and today we are helping a mutual friend (Sherry) move. We were discussing furniture and things for Sherry and Mitch mentioned Sherry will be taking those three chairs I have. I admit I only have two because I threw one away since the seat had molded. Mitch is upset that I threw the chair away. They state they could have taken the seat off and replaced it. They ask that I replace the chair. This is from a set of chairs sold at Walmart 6 some odd years ago, I did a cursory internet search and it's pretty much not possible to find even the exact same set and certainly not just one chair. I tell them I will do my best to replace it. They replied that they wish I would have asked first, which is fair enough. We continued the night pretty fine. I know they're still a upset but it'll fade and I'll keep my eyes peeled at lawn sales and thrift shops for a comparable chair. If it's important to them I'll find a way to replace it. Am I the AH for throwing away the chair instead of asking them? It clearly upset them and I respect that but I don't feel as if I did much actually wrong for discarding an item that I didn't even know if or when they'd actually retrieve them, and was technically a biohazard.

        "selftext": "TLDR: Indian FIL is intentionally mispronouncing and misspelling our son\u2019s name because he wanted the more culturally traditional version of his name vs the westernized version. Husband and I are both really bothered by this, but sharing how we feel will likely cause tension and his mother will be caught in the middle (she\u2019s an absolute gem). My son was born 3 months ago. I (31, F) am white, husband (33, M) is half Hispanic and half Indian. We spent a LONG time mulling over names and landed on giving him the same name as my husband\u2019s (long story short - wanted a name that could cross cultures, was easy to pronounce, and had good meaning). The day my son was born, FIL (Indian) really harps on questioning our name choice (which he\u2019d done before). My husband and I then, too, began to doubt ourselves and spent that entire night discussing - finally landing on a name that FIL approved of. The next day, FIL says our spelling and pronunciation of name is bad (he wants his culture\u2019s more traditional way). We made clear we weren\u2019t changing it, and he sat there in the hospital room loudly watching videos on the pronunciation of how he wanted it. EDIT TO ADD: FIL doesn\u2019t have strong accent, speaks fluent English and is fully capable of pronouncing it the way we\u2019ve spelled/pronounce it. Fast forward, he still pronounces it the way he wants to and now even spells it the way he wants to. My husband is on my side that we don\u2019t like it\u2026but I\u2019m questioning if it\u2019s worth causing tension or not. I know it will always bother me, but I am sure I can get by with just being annoyed by it. Context: FIL is one to stop talking to family for periods of time when he feels slighted. He is very particular and causes a lot of family drama\u2026so often we choose to keep the peace for the sake of his mother (who is a saint). He\u2019s the only one with this issue.",

        "selftext": "throwaway acc, dont want personal info on my main.   so the other day my (17 m) dad walked in and asked me if I'd bought any valentines for my mom, stepmom, and brother. I was kind of caught off-guard and i said no, and he told me i needed to 'get on that'. i struggle to tell with him what's a suggestion vs what's a demand/if i don't do it I'll be in trouble, and getting in trouble is very stressful for me for some context: my parents divorced when i was little and have 50/50 custody. both remarried a few years after. mom set firm boundaries with how her and my stepdad parent me, she sees it as her job to parent me and he can be the fun stepdad but he doesn't get to discipline me, that's her job dad took a different approach, and let stepmom do a lot of parenting of me when i was young. we did not have the best relationship in the past , but it's better now, enough to where we can spend time together sometimes and i don't really mind her. she's nice and i appreciate all she does but she's not really a parent to me.   i asked my mom when i next saw her, and she said she doesn't want anything. i might make something as a thank you for her (she always gets me candy and trinkets for valentines since i don't really get valentines otherwise) and maybe i'll grab some candy for my brother since he's a kid (still in elementary) but i've never gotten either of them gifts for valentines before and it's never been an issue, and i dunno if doing that now will cause issues so maybe I'll just get something for little bro im not sure how relevant it is, but i do have suspected autism (multiple professionals we saw highly suspected it and recommended testing)but i haven't been able to get the assessment yet so no official diagnosis.   i only mention this because I'm not always the best with social situations, so it's not unheard of to be told I was rude on accident/am not doing something the way it's supposed to be done. but at the same time, I feel like it would've come up sooner if it was something expected of me? I'm not sure, I don't want to be rude at all I'm mostly just confused i dunno what dad will say if i don't get her anything, i don't want it to be a big deal really i just think it's kind of odd, but now I'm thinking about just getting her something small to avoid any fights. valentines day is approaching fast and I'm kinda nervous about it   so, WIBTA if i don't get her anything ? I'm genuinely not sure anymore. my friends i asked said it's fine but most of my friends don't really like my dad (and are also MY friends so ofc they'd side with me..) so I'd like an unbiased opinion on this. thanks for the help",

He is currently in school for web development and has been working to become proficient with PC. He now knows more about coding than me and has become quite proficient. When his flight Sim broke, he asked me to fix it. I politely told him I can't fix everything, it's probably a simple issue, this is a good test for you. You should try and fix it. Start with steam, get the quest to connect to steam and then try to get it to connect to flight Sim. If you still have trouble, I will help but you need to try yourself. he then responded can't I just reinstall windows and start from scratch?. I told him, no don't do that, we installed loads of crazy drivers to get your Mac studio display to work on a pc. If you reinstall Windows, that will all be gone and I Dont wanna have to go through that nightmare again. Do not reaintall windows.  A few days later he is asking me to fix his pc because he has reinstalled windows. This really upset me since I told him not to. I told him no, that it is now his problem.

The main ones that are important in this story are Tachycardia and chronic pain: I wear a hip brace and sometimes a knee brace for, but I'm trying to get a cane (the pain isn't only in those spots, it's basically all my joints and bones, but that's all my dad will let me get things for(will get into later)). I also have a lot of mental issues which are all diagnosed and I take medicine for. Alright, onto the main story. Due to my health issues, I've been trying to convince my dad to let me go to the doctors' to get checked out + I want to go so I can help prove to insurance that I need a cane (which multiple people in the health field have recommended), but my dad won't listen to me about that. He won't even let me get wrist braces. Because of the pain, I complain a lot about how my body hurts, and my dad tells me If you're so used to it, then it's not a big deal and stuff like that. We've gotten into arguments about this multiple times but I've mainly given up trying to convince him. But then came today; I had a really important meeting with a psychiatrist today which could effect the rest of my life. I had been stressing about it since last week since it's my second meeting with them. I was going to get picked up at around 1, but my dad texted me. He told me(summarized) Hey, I have to cancel the meeting until they have an opening because my heart is feeling really bad right now. Plus my head hurts badly and I might have to go the doctors' later.When he sent this, I became furious because he described his symptoms, it was the exact same things I've been dealing with since I was 11, and he's always tried downplaying it.Here's where I may be the A-hole. Instead of telling my dad Oh! I hope you feel better or something, I told him Have you taken an advil plus drank water? Or have you rested enough? Ir's probably just acid-reflux and then You should be fine after you take medicine and water. He told me that he still felt bad and that I should be more considerate.I feel bad because when he picked me up at the normal time to head home instead of early for the meeting, he sounded really in pain and tired: and I had been really rude over text. But at the same time, I feel pretty satisfied that he got mad at me for downplaying his symptoms and acting like it was an everyday thing to feel bad (which it is for me) the same way he did to me. I don't know, it's a weird situation. Any perspectives are welcome and I'm fine if I was in the wrong, I just can't tell right now.",

We have a nice sized house. We all have our own rooms. I work at an after school program so it's from 1:30 to 6:00 not a lot of hours but It's still work. I'm going to start College in the summer, fingers crossed. Anyway my brother B also works at an after school program same hours as me. Neither of us drive so He bikes and I take an Electric scooter which I payed for myself. So I typically get home before him.  The only difference between us is that he has a SHIT ton more freedom than I do. Which is fine I don't mind he has a lot of friends and goes out a lot. After work or on the weekends. Or even sometimes on the weekdays. So when I'm home my siblings E and T are also home.  My parents D and P (my step mom) are extremely social people so they always have something going on. And E and T aren't always allowed to join them on their adventures for example when they go out to have adult hang outs or parties. The times my parents stay out really late. And I do mean late they usually come back between 12:00 to 2:00am. Which I don't mind. They're adults and they can enjoy their lives.  What annoys me though is that whenever my parents leave T and E in our care (I say our care because B is supposed to help too) but it usually ends up just being me taking care of them, making them dinner, keeping them entertained, making sure they get to bed on time. Thing like that. On top of that we recently just got a puppy her name is Stella and she's only 10 weeks old so she needs to constantly be watched. And in the mornings before I leave for work I watch Stella and my other dog Diva who's only a year old. No help from him whatsoever. He stays in his room until he leaves for work or wakes up at 11:00. We both have ADHD and have medication. So we have to take it in the morning.  Anyway lately it's been getting worse. P always leaves us a list of chores she wants done before we both go to work (which is fine because I genuinely need a visual list for me to be able to get things done) And I usually end up doing 90% of them since B doesn't wake up or just doesn't leave his room. Don't get me wrong it's not that he never helps he just rarely does so. But it's so frustrating when I'm watching the kids or the dogs and doing chores while he chills in his room playing videogames. It's not like he works anymore than I do. Or does anything about the house when he is home. Plus when he randomly decides to go out guess who's stuck doing extra chores that HE should be doing? Me. It's getting really annoying, Even my parents are getting frustrated with his lack of helping. But he doesn't seem to care. AITA for telling him to do stuff around the house?",

I made the comment then maybe we will have a dry wedding instead and that upset her as well but ultimately said it's your wedding do what you want. It wasnt what she said it was how she said it. With her attitude I'm considering not inviting her at all. She always makes a spectacle of herself and is overbearing. I also dont want my sister coming because she is super extra and both of them will end up fighting over one thing or another. So would ibta for inviting them and keeping our wedding small and drama free?",

        "selftext": "Last year, my fianc\u00e9 and I signed a lease for a townhome while planning our wedding, and I decided to get a roommate to help with expenses since we are living separately to save for the wedding. The place is furnished by us, but I left one room downstairs empty. My fianc\u00e9 stayed with me briefly approx. 3 weeks due to family issues, she only needed a place to sleep, and I made sure to talk to him about it, and he was fine with it.  Things got uncomfortable when my roommate got back with his girlfriend, who began spending more time at the house. It started with occasional visits, but soon, she was here so often it felt like she practically lived with us. I\u2019d come home to find her asleep on the couch, eating food from the fridge, she has her own place. This wasn\u2019t a huge problem at first, but it became more frequent, and she\u2019d sometimes be in the house when no one else was. Then my roommate had a friend stay for a week, leaving a mess. Although they cleaned it up eventually, it was annoying and uncomfortable. I decided to talk to my roommate about it, expressing that it was the frequency of his girlfriend being over that bothered me, and how it was affecting the shared living spaces. He was visibly annoyed and didn\u2019t talk to me much after that. Things didn\u2019t improve, and over time, I felt like I couldn\u2019t relax in the common areas because it seemed like they were irritated when I was around. I started staying in my room to avoid the tension. I didn\u2019t want to make things worse by bringing it up again, so I vented to my fianc\u00e9. She suggested I speak to him again, but I didn\u2019t want to keep pushing the issue. Eventually, I got the flu and decided to stay at my mom\u2019s house because I couldn\u2019t relax at home with his girlfriend there. My fianc\u00e9, not knowing where I was, drove over to check on me. I explained why I wasn\u2019t at the townhome, and she asked if I\u2019d talked to my roommate about my concerns. I admitted I hadn\u2019t. My fianc\u00e9 offered to talk to him since she\u2019s better at communicating, but when she did, he got annoyed, saying he could have his girlfriend over as much as he wanted since he paid bills & she is not someone he should have this conversation with only with me. Later, when I spoke to him, he said that if I could have my fianc\u00e9  living there, he should be allowed to have his girlfriend & any guest as much as he wants (my fianc\u00e9 only stayed 3 weeks, she has been here for 3 months). I tried explaining it wasn\u2019t about her staying over, but how frequently she was there. He accused me of double standards, which wasn\u2019t my intention. I don\u2019t want to micromanage him, but it bothers me when she\u2019s here alone or when he brings random people over. I even suggested that if he and his girlfriend want to live together, they could find their own place, but he just walked away, and nothing was resolved.",

The wife often has explosive rows with her husband and gets really ugly verbally. I can hear it and she has apologised to me a few times after. I have always said nw and that it\u2019s their house and I understand.  Recently, the topic of noise in shared spaces came up again and I mentioned that while the noise doesn\u2019t bother me , sometimes I do get anxious when they fight that she will scream at me if I do something as she\u2019s already angry.  While she did not say anything atm, shortly after she sent me a couple long texts on WhatsApp to express that she was v upset at what I had said and that I was completely unjustified and unfair for what I said and to not come in to their living room and being my own issues to her( I tried justifying how I felt anxious by saying I have a habit of internalising other peoples emotions). She also said I would never understand what they argue over because of my age ( I am atleast a decade younger than them both).  While we have both apologised, her apology felt like \u2018 I am sorry you feel this way BUT\u2019.  I have a few weeks of my tenancy left but this exchange has genuinely left me feeling very stressed.  Am I not allowed to express how I feel? Is it not wrong for her to say I should not bring my issues to her ( I don\u2019t! ) but she can air hers out loud enough for me to hear? Is it also not mean to basically call me stupid and make me feel bad by saying they\u2019re having a really hard time in their relationship? I never asked her to justify why they fight, simply that her anger makes me anxious for myself.  I am just v taken back by her texts and feel like I will have to navigate around her feelings and hide from her the rest of my tenancy.",

She said I\u2019m too \u201cwild\u201d and lost my track. I\u2019m currently at my boyfriend\u2019s house right now because being in their house has been so horrific. She said I\u2019m wild because I return home around 10 pm and leave in the morning around 7 am.

So I\u2019m going back to school this spring to get my masters in education. She knows this. But she yelled and got snippy and nasty with me because I don\u2019t stay home.

I come home around 10 because I respect their wishes that they don\u2019t want me spending the night with my boyfriend. It just seems like a control thing that she wants me in the house. I\u2019m 24 btw. And I\u2019m from an Asian family.

Since moving in it has become apparent that Jane does not clean or tidy often, I have taken on the majority share of housework and maintain a clean and tidy apartment. She has a 6yr old chihuahua (Buster) who is not properly trained and regularly goes to the bathroom throughout the house. Buster usually does his business on the floor of her room when she isn\u2019t around.  Jane\u2019s room constantly smells and is never tidied. She leaves clothes and other items on the floor which buster will use as a bathroom. Jane is going away on holiday for two weeks and asked if I will take care of buster otherwise she will have to pay for a kennel. this means cleaning up after him at least twice a day for 2 weeks. I requested in exchange for dog sitting buster that Jane\u2019s room be completely clean and nothing left on the floor. Allowing me to go into the room and clean effectively.  As part of my request I reminded her about how unhygienic the room is when buster is constantly using it as a toilet and that the smell is unbearable for me. She was immediately defensive stating that it didn\u2019t smell and she was doing well cleaning it. I ended the conversation saying that those were my conditions. Am I the asshole for requesting that she clean or should I leave it alone because it\u2019s her room?",

I was working Wednesday night shifts after school but I realised Wednesday was my busiest day and I always have heaps of work set after school that is generally due by the next day.

        "selftext": "Me (18M) only work weekends for the time being, I am preparing to go into the military so I am not going to university. My mum works 4 days a week away from home and my dad works a 4 days on/off schedule. In the day, because I am the only one in the house, I do all the housework because if I leave a single thing that hasn\u2019t been done my mum goes ballistic and complains that I have done no work. She also has ruled out certain tasks I do in the house as not being chores (like the dish washing), so even if I do them it means I haven\u2019t done any work in the day. Because I am going into the forces, I also go to the gym/home workout every weekday. This means that by the time I\u2019ve done everything that needs to be done it\u2019s mid afternoon and the time my parents come home. I see them, make them a cup of tea and spend some time with them. We then eat dinner together, I do the washing up after that then go upstairs. The thing is, the whole day I have not spoken to a single friend, as they\u2019ve all gone off to uni and usually spend the evenings talking and chatting to them on games. However my mum often says that I hardly see her and gets annoyed that I don\u2019t spend my evenings with them. However, if I do this I don\u2019t speak to a single friend. I\u2019m now writing this after I had a very stressful day at work, I came back at early evening and I just want to sit back and relax in quiet in my own space, and my mum comes charging into my room shouting at me that I never see her and only see her in car journeys. This has happened a few times now and it\u2019s just made me want to spend less time with her, because I feel like it\u2019s forced now. She also guilt trips by saying \u201cwe know what you prefer\u201d, context being that I prefer to spend time with friends up in my room than to see my family allegedly.  I feel bad that I don\u2019t spend time with them, but the truth is that I often don\u2019t want to because they don\u2019t do much other than sit and watch TV and do their own things in the day. I just get bored because no one seems keen to do anything that we all do together. I have also noticed that my dad and sister never talk or shout at me about any of this, in fact my sister literally says I like to \u201ctuck myself away\u201d and \u201cdo my own thing\u201d. I feel like I\u2019m not allowed to do this anymore, even more so when I\u2019ve become 18 and got a career on the way.",

        "selftext": "Hey Reddit, I\u2019m a 36-year-old dealing with some unresolved family and financial issues from my past, and I need your perspective. The Backstory:I worked full time at my parents\u2019 Quiznos for about five years. Based on the minimum wage rates during those years (assuming 40 hours per week), I should have earned roughly $72K in gross wages. After subtracting partial payments they made\u2014specifically, $600 per month for 4 months (totaling $2,400) while I was in college, plus an extra $400 they gave to cover divorce lawyer fees\u2014I calculated a net claim of around $69,400. Family Dynamics and My Situation:\t\u2022\tI lived with my parents until June 2007. Later, I returned and stayed with them for about half a year before eventually getting kicked out. After that, I ended up moving from couch to couch.\t\u2022\tMy immigration status was a huge issue because my parents never set it up correctly. I ended up with no proper status, and my mom even told me I should have saved money since I was essentially on my own.\t\u2022\tThroughout all of this, my dad never actually paid me what I was owed for the work I did\u2014even though I was working full time and handling responsibilities well beyond just making sandwiches. My Request:Now, after all these years, I\u2019m asking my parents for the back pay I\u2019m owed. I know this might stir up family drama, especially since they own the business, and I\u2019m aware that some might see it as ungrateful. But the fact remains: I worked for them, I wasn\u2019t paid what I was owed, and I\u2019ve been left to deal with the financial fallout for decades. So, AITA for asking my parents for the back pay from my time working at Quiznos? I\u2019d appreciate any thoughts or advice on whether my request is fair given the circumstances. Thanks in advance. \u2014 Conarly  UPDATE So I graduated high school in June of 2006 and started in march of 2006.. I was 17 at the time a minor until November 2006 where I turned 18 .. from November till may I worked almost 72hr due to him getting in an accident.. I then got told to go live in England because me and my dad was having trouble getting along.. I went to England paid by my parents yes.. worked in England moved to Germany and came back a year and a half later.. I was 20 Turning 21 I live with my parents 6 months after that when I was kicked out again..due to standing up for my self asking for some sort of pay or recognition.. without a visa I had no choice but to work for my dad who said he\u2019ll pay me $4 an hour to keep it under the radar of the irs since I was illegally here in the USA.. btw he didn\u2019t pay me the $4 dollars an hour he would make calculations on how I\u2019d be left with a 4 dollar paycheck.. I was living on a friends couch working for my dad and having another job at another Quiznos. Friend kicked me out after 3 weeks after he blamed his pot on me.. I went to another friends house when I stayed on they couch paid rent while working both jobs and barley having anything left over.. I worked for my dad til the age of 23 where I would finally have enough of his abuse and quit. By the way since this time I\u2019ve built myself a pretty good life.. I have worked hard on shredded the verbal and physical abuse that my dad gave me my whole life.. I got married got papers and now have legal immigration status here in the us due to my hard work.. another thing is I am requesting now after all this time is because one.. I don\u2019t like feeling taken advantage without ever being able to get right about the situation.. so I think if I move forward at least pay me for wages when I didn\u2019t live with you and didn\u2019t get to save a thing before you kicked me out without a leg to stand on.. another reason why I\u2019m asking my old employer to pay me is because he couldn\u2019t at the time and that\u2019s the reason he kept giving.. he now came into a life changing amount of money and I\u2019m asking for my wages that\u2019s it\u2019s.. not trying to sue for more than what I didn\u2019t get paid",

I told him numerous times about how I'm worried about how this technology will impact me landing a job in the future and how the whole concept pisses me off. This was before he even started down the whole content creation stuff.He empathized with me and I thought he understood but he clearly didn't. He went as far as to hide what he was doing for a while before finally telling me about it. He's pretty upset that l'm unsupportive but he already knew how I felt about it. I don't get why he expects me to change my mind on it, especially when it's unnecessary. There are a million ways to make videos he doesn't need to generate these images. But he keeps trying to show me to change my mind. He says It's actually not that easy it took me a long time to generate all of these images. Can't you just be happy for me? It's hard, I know that he's always wanted to make videos and it's the first time in a while that he's been so excited but I just don't get why he has to do it this way. Am I being a jerk?

I just found out I\u2019m having a girl about last week and was waiting to give them the go on planning the shower, I wanted to know the gender first then pick a theme then. I ended up picking Winnie the Pooh for the theme. My SIL and MIL are both control freaks, they both need to be in control of every situation and especially in party planning. I am not that way, I am the type of person that would be happy to do whatever is needed. They just had a lunch regarding baby shower talk, I thought this is a collaborating meeting and they would be delegating who would be doing what and paying for what. Mind you, my SIL is not contributing much but her time. My mil is contributing time and money. When the meeting was done, my SIL called me after the lunch and stated that my MIL was mad and completely changed when my SIL told her that everything was handled. Me and my MIL were under the impression that this was going to be a collaborative meeting, I didn\u2019t know my SIL had basically figured out everything already. My MIL was taken back by this understandably but my MIL is also very detailed orientated and wants things her done her way. My MIL states she has no say in the shower now and does not want to be apart of this anymore. I later asked my SIL to let her have some of the duties and my SIL basically said everything is done and there is nothing to do. My MIL called my husband and stated \u201cif you don\u2019t want me in this child\u2019s life just tell me\u201d over a disagreement over a baby shower and a discussion that I was not even involved in. I hate drama and I would rather not have the drama go on and cancel the baby shower entirely. Am I the asshole to cancel it entirely so they both cannot continue their antics?

This time, several members of the cast went out separately (including me), but did not invite a person in the cast we did not get along with. This girl (we can call her Janice) has caused problems with me and my friends for the past four years. She has been constantly jealous of my best friend and has been attempting to take every opportunity she gets away from her. Before our show closed, I and my close friends went out to eat WITHOUT Janice. She saw this as a personal attack and told her mother, who then posted to Facebook saying, Seriously? You're overheard making plans, and then you lie about it to purposely exclude people? Nice... really nice. I and my friends were all extremely angry about this post and met up to talk about it. Janice found out and attempted to insert herself into the situation. We politely declined, explaining that we had our own plans and would spend time with her later. Her mother then added to her previous post, Some people just need to grow up. I and my friends were infuriated and have not responded yet. The majority of my friend group are adults, including Janice, and we are very disappointed in her reaction. I am done with Janice's immature behavior and her mother, who backs her up on every single situation that doesn't favor her. What do you think of Reddit? ",

My dad (57M) and brother, both heavy drinkers, have been bitter about my girlfriend and me living together and consider us immoral for occasionally smoking a certain green substance\u2014despite their own reckless drinking habits, even in the car.

However, lately her and her boyfriend (19 m) have been having some issues. I never liked her boyfriend to begin with, and my friend has always known that. Him and I have had our fair share of screaming matches since they got together and if I lacked the impulse control we probably still would. One thing I noticed when him and I would have these screaming matches is that he would tell me things that my friend hadn't told me.  Last week she called me at 7:00 AM to complain to me about her boyfriend for what felt like the hundredth time. I was sick at the time so hadn't been getting much sleep but looking back at it I honestly don't regret a word I said. I'll write how the conversation went but I will use fake names for privacy and respect. Me: Hey, I'm still pretty sick so I'm really tired right now, is everything alright?  Kayla: *sobbing* Dominic is being so mean right now, we were supposed to meet for coffee but we got into a fight this morning and now he won't talk to me  Me: Kayla just give it some time, try to breath and maybe you two can go for coffee tomorrow or do something later  Kayla: I don't wanna do it tomorrow I wanna do it today!  Me: I know, but Kayla I've tried to tell you before that when you two get like this it's not healthy and you both just need to give each other some space.  Kayla: This is so stupid, I don't get why he's like this  Me: I've tried to tell you multiple times that I honestly don't think you guys are right for each other, you call me like this almost every other day  Kayla: No I love him, we're just having a tough time right now.  Me: Kayla I'm sorry but I'm sick of this, you call me like this all the time for advice and you never listen. I've tried to help you multiple times but clearly you don't want help, you just want to complain and I'm not the person you should do that to. I've been way to stressed right now to deal with dumb things like these and you know it. I can't control you but I've tried to give you advice so many times, so if you don't wanna listen then I'm not going to either. You can take my advice or don't talk to me about him anymore.  Then she hung up the phone but I was to tired and to sick to care. I texted her later in the day apologizing for being so harsh but I told her my point still stands. She didn't respond so I left it at that but I've tried to text or talk to her about unrelated things and she's still ignoring me. AITA?",

        "selftext": "My (23M) friend/flatmate (34f) has a very sweet and loving cat that I believe she is not looking after very well.  For context she is a very busy university student currently studying a masters degree. Her cat has a history of running rampant in her room, has destroyed plants and various things, gone to the toilet on mine and a flatmates bed, and just done various other chaotic acts.  Personally, I believe he does these things because of her neglect and lack of care. Firstly she takes him on multiple 5+ hour car journeys a year whenever she goes home from uni. She keeps him in a cage that is just big enough to fit his bed, litter tray and food/water bowls whenever she is out (so he doesn't destroy things). He never goes outside even on walks with her. He is barely allowed outside of her room even when he is out of the cage because of his destructive nature.  He had an injury lately which meant he had to have a cone on his head and be in the cage for a while and even though the cone is off, the cage remains. She uses excuses like he is a chaotic cat and there is too much stuff in her room for him to destroy, but honestly most of it is trinkets and things she never uses that could easily be tidied away or thrown out if she wanted to give the cat more freedom. Or plants she keep buying even though she knows he will probably just knock more over.  He is such a lovely cat, very gentle when he is calm, he loves pets and attention and is really quite intelligent. I have been looking after him while she is away with instructions to feed him twice a day and put him back in the cage whenever I'm done. It just feels so wrong. I have played with him when I can and let him roam the house but he tried to jump out a barely open window in the 2nd floor, which just kind of shows how desperate he is to explore and have more freedom.  She does care for this cat but I am worried she is just using him as an emotional support without fully having the capacity to look after him well enough. He is a bit overweight and she spoils him with treats (like over Christmas he had 4 advent calenders) but he clearly isn't getting enough excercise. Her mental health is not good and she got him straight after her previous cat died so I want to approach this gently but firmly with her. I'm not sure what to say. Also when she takes him to her parents home, the cat is suddenly in a multiple cat household (although they all get along apparently) and allowed to roam for the most part. But she and the vet believe this is where his injury came from (fox bite) and I'm sure it must be very unstable for him going between the two: from extreme freedom to caged life. When she is home he can be out of his cage, but again just in one room and I often hear her telling him off because he just gets overstimulated and runs around.  What do I say to her that won't break our friendship but ensure this cat gets better treatment? ",

House proceeds with furthermore be referred to as savings At first it was fun and fine he hung out with us after work and school and allowed us to have a date night about once a month since I was spending my savings to compensate him not having enough money to cover his third of the rent (he doesn't pay for any other bills other than periodic groceries.

I've been with my partner for 8 years and she's aware of how much this means to me. I do want to note that I'm more than happy to miss out on any other game, and often record games or miss out entirely for every other game of the season. However, this season we are in a final the day before my mother and father in law go on a holiday that we organised for them to go to New York.

Half my problem is that she knows I get anxious and it sometimes stops me from even going downstairs if I feel like my mother in law is annoyed etc. I'm not sure if I'm being the asshole here if I was to stay home/go out to watch the final instead of going to the hotel with them to see them off?

        "selftext": "On mobile, apologize if the formatting is rough.  For backstory, my (24F) maternal grandmother (J) passed away when she was 33 and my mother was 5. My grandfather had 5 children in total with her. In true Dutch fashion, he put out an ad in Holland for a \u201chousekeeper\u201d, who he married about a year after she (B) moved in. From that time forward, my mother and her 4 full siblings were expected to call this new woman mom and no one ever spoke of their actual mother. B had two children with my grandfather, who she favoured to the point of severely neglecting the other 5 she was supposed to be a mother to. My grandfather, never one for things like emotion and accountability, would ignore, aid and abet, or flat out deny any form of mistreatment from day one until present day.  Most of my aunts and uncles have already made it clear that they refuse to forgive without at bare minimum an apology from the both of them, which has never occurred. My mom however, (now 49F), has been working on her relationship with them and has done her best to forgive and let the past be the past. From what I\u2019ve heard from her and my Dad (49M) about it, it has helped her with her mental health etc. which has suffered a lot for the majority of her life. I have two main points on why I hold my grudge. First, I didn\u2019t know that B wasn\u2019t my bio grandmother until I was 17, and my older sister told me the truth. I still know virtually nothing about J, other than that older sister was named after her. I never had a relationship with my mom that felt like anything other than walking on eggshells and just having a woman who lives in my house and cooks and cleans and does laundry etc. I still barely know her, though I love her deeply and hold nothing against her. I know that it\u2019s solely because of her childhood trauma that she wasn\u2019t the mother I always wanted and needed, so I don\u2019t see it as her fault really. Secondly and more personally, my mom once told me that my grandfather at one point \u201cheld me down in bed until I fell asleep\u201d once when I was very young and staying the night there. I know I was a particularly needy child and have always had issues with sleep, which is what he used to justify it at the time. Now, he is both losing his cognitive abilities and would most certainly deny it ever happening to his grave. This event naturally traumatized me. My mom either doesn\u2019t know anything else about the incident or simply is unable to tell me because any time I\u2019ve attempted to bring it up to her she instantly bursts into tears, and I can see and feel how much guilt she carries about it. I don\u2019t blame her for any of this. The reason I\u2019m not sure if I would be TA is because I don\u2019t want my negative feelings and borderline hatred of my mom\u2019s parents to affect her mental health negatively or impact my relationship with her.

        "selftext": "I'm a 26-year-old woman with a male cat named Michelangelo, or Mikey. He was initially a gift from my mom and her boyfriend to my sister-in-law (SIL) when he was just a tiny kitten. My brother and SIL lived with me then in our shared apartment. However, they leave Mikey behind when they decide to move out and find their own place. I took it upon myself to look after him. I've been responsible for all his needs, from feeding him to taking him to the vet and buying litter. Lately, I've realized that my sister-in-law treats Mikey as if he still belongs to her, even though she has shown little interest in or care for him since they moved out. She never checks in on him or contributes financially to his care, which I find frustrating. My brother and SIL argue that it doesn't matter who cares for the cat because my mom gifted Mikey to my sister-in-law. They believe that since she was the one who received him, she has a right to call him her cat. However, it's unfair for her to claim ownership of Mikey when she has abandoned him and doesn't participate in his care. Compounding the issue, my brother and sister-in-law are planning to move into a new place that doesn't allow pets, which means they would be unable to take Mikey with them regardless. Given this situation, I feel justified in asserting that Mikey is my cat since I am the one taking care of him. So, AITA for referring to Mikey as my cat?",

        "selftext": "For context, I have a close friend whom I\u2019ve known since middle school whose mental and physical health have suffered a lot in the past two years, and I really do feel for her but sometimes our relationship has been much more difficult lately than it used to be because she now needs a lot more attention than I can give, and there\u2019s been tension between us on and off for a while. Right now she is extra unhappy with me. My husband and I suffered a miscarriage this month and right now there is a condolence gift from her waiting for me at the post office since Tuesday (it\u2019s Sunday) because no one was home to sign for it, and I have not had the energy (or the burning desire, to be honest) to go pick it up.  This is probably made worse by the fact that she is someone who wants to hang out all the time, and I haven\u2019t wanted to see anybody or do anything in about 3 weeks. She sent a card too which was very sweet, and I thanked her for that and thanked her for sending me a gift, but I let her know that I didn\u2019t have a chance to pick it up yet and was not sure exactly when I would. I will pick it up. I will! But I want to give myself a minute. Because: 1. I don\u2019t like stuff. It doesn\u2019t actually matter what it is. My love language is not gifts. When I buy something and bring it into our house, I choose it really carefully and think about it for a long time. I can pretend well enough to be gracious and give people the response they want from me when I receive a gift, but my true feelings are that I hate receiving gifts because they almost always become a chore, one more thing to add to the pile of things to find a new home for without just chucking them and adding to the landfills. I hate things, I can never punt enough things out of my home fast enough, and I hate this about our culture. 2. Trips to the post office are my least favorite kind of errand. Our post office doesn\u2019t have a parking lot, there are always lines, etc. I avoid having to go there even when I\u2019m not depressed and dealing with something, so the truth is I\u2019m a little annoyed that she set me up for an obligatory post office trip. Though I know better than to ket her know that.  She doesn\u2019t understand and is upset that I didn\u2019t make haste to cut through my grief and depression to go pick up this gift (which yes, as an aside, has a very good chance of being something I will not want, and which I\u2019ll need to drum up energy to find a new home for at some point.) Am I cranky, depressive, isolating? Yes. But am I allowed? AITA?",

But now friend 2 is done with friend 1 and invited me.  For record, I have no intention of engaging with friend 1. I would not be here for her, and I would simply ignore her. Yet I know she would react badly, and I fear it would be a very asshole thing to do to force my presence onto her. At the same time, I think friend 2 would be disappointed with me if I didn't come.

Alright, so I am a girl and I won't say much for privacy reasons but I do need advice. I have a crush me and her are close since 6th grade we did date but we broke up due to my mother being the type of parent that only supports the lgbtq+ if its not family.   Lately me and my crush who I will call Love for the time being. Me and love have reconnected I never lost feelings since I didn't even want to break up but me and Love been talking on the phone a lot and we like to call while playing games together. But lately its every single day. Don't get me wrong I love hanging out with Love.   But we do have school and I am the type of person who wants to work hard so you can have a good life and I believe school is the best thing to focus on. Love has been skipping school to talk and call me a lot and likes to message me during class naturally I don't respond unless I finish all my work.   But its getting to the point that I get messages 24/7 I fine with a clingy partner since above all this is my fault since I know this is how she is but everyday after school she wants to immediately call and play games and its getting exhausting. Then I feel bad if I don't respond back or say I can't because she will message with oh..okay  And even if I respond with I can't because I am either doing homework or school work or watching a movie which is always true as I never want to lie to Love she would still text do you wanna call and play games. Even today when I told her I was looking for a movie while eating dinner I had just finished making she immediately respond with do you want to call and play games.  All I need is some advice to what you do since the long nights of calling and playing games is effecting me hard as I like to sleep at 5:25 pm for a rested night but she likes to keep calling at 4 am which is the time I get ready since I need to catch the bus for school due to it being a private type school which I can't afford to get kicked out of.

        "selftext": "So just a brief intro, I was living away from home for uni up until recently, and my brothers (29 + 23) are still living there, having never moved out for a whole host of reasons which I won't get into here but will be happy to elaborate on if anyone is interested. It basically boils down to substance abuse issues and then getting the easy life at home, being provided for by my 60 year old mother. She buys all their food, amongst other things, that's important to keep in mind. I recently moved back to my mum's in order to save money while I save to move country to do my masters degree. It has been quite unbearable, to be honest, trying to adjust to the lack of independence. Anyway lol, I have a pretty specific diet, namely Whole Foods, Plant Based - I don't eat added/processed sugar, dairy/meat/animal products etc. Because of this, I buy ALL my own food and don't touch the stuff my mum buys for them bc they eat a pretty Standard American Diet, which is of no interest to me.  The issue is, for the last few months since I moved back, my food is constantly being eaten. Despite the fact that I have taken to writing my name on my food with black sharpie as they were (potentially feigning) ignorance originally. Just this week for example, a good lot of my veg has been eaten, they somehow went through a full loaf of wholegrain bread overnight, my hummus was half eaten, my falafel, pickles, no-added sugar baked beans, my homemade veg burgers amongst others were all eaten. Bizarrely, my vegan cheese was eaten when they have actual dairy cheese available to them IN THE SAME FRIDGE. I have said to them multiple times, but they get very defensive and say it's only a few quid or it's only frozen veg, what like 40p? I have said to my mum as well twice now, tho I don't want to go on at her bc it's not her problem and she's already stressed enough, and her response is pretty much the same, even saying what do you expect of course they'll eat what's in the fridge. There is no acknowledgement on my brothers' parts of the fact that it's not really about the money (tho that's certainly part of it), but about the principal of respect and boundaries. I feel like I'm genuinely going insane. Should I stop going on about it? I do feel like an AH for bringing it up all the time, but then i also feel strongly that their behaviour should change and not my reaction to it. Idk, what do yous think? ",

        "selftext": "Using a throwaway because she uses this subreddit also. Sorry for any typos I wrote this in a rush. Yeah, this is kind of weird, but I needed to ask because I'm autistic and also aroace, so I'm not too great with social stuff, especially for Valentine\u2019s Day, so I was wondering if I was in the wrong here. Recently my (18m) best friend (18f) asked me for some help with making a gift for her boyfriend (again 18m). They\u2019ve been dating for a few months, and her boyfriend and I happen to have similar interests, and I like crafts, so she originally asked me to help her make some matching bracelets for them, which I was super excited to do. I even ordered some new materials to do so since all my bracelet-making stuff has gotten kind of old and brittle. Earlier this week, though, she told me that I wouldn\u2019t have to make them anymore, which was a little sad, but I could still use the materials to make gifts for the rest of our friend group (which I want to be a surprise). Anyways, this is all to say I know she\u2019s planning to give him something on Valentine\u2019s Day. likely handmade since she likes crafts as well. Recently she texted me that she didn\u2019t even want flowers for Valentine\u2019s Day anymore, and when I asked why, she explained that her boyfriend was making it sound like a hassle to get her them. I was pretty upset, but I just told her that it was a weird thing for him to say. I would like to add this is not a thing of flowers being expensive or anything he can very much afford it. He simply doesn\u2019t want to go out of the way to get them for her. Also, she literally had to ask him to make him get her those flowers. Not sure if it was a Valentine's gift in general, but definitely for the flowers. This is where I might be the asshole. I decided to go to the store and buy some construction paper, following a YouTube tutorial I saw to try and make her a paper bouquet. I originally thought it\u2019d be a nice gesture, especially if her boyfriend doesn\u2019t get her the flowers. I don\u2019t have many friends in real life, so I told one of my online friends about it since I didn\u2019t want to spoil the surprise. They ended up scolding me, though, and told me I was overstepping and that it\u2019d be like I was trying to one-up her boyfriend. I didn\u2019t think I was wrong at first, but now I'm conflicted. I don\u2019t want to one up him or anything I just want to make my friend happy. So yeah, would I be the asshole if I gave my best friend a paper bouquet for Valentine\u2019s Day? EDIT: Forgot to say it\u2019s normal for the two of us to give each other gifts on Valentine\u2019s Day. We\u2019ve been doing it ever since we were kids I\u2019m talking about the specific gift because I\u2019m going to be giving her something no matter what.",

Zach also has a son(17), who I\u2019ll call Joe. Joe calls me and Hank uncle, and we both see him as a nephew. Hank is engaged and will be getting married in two months. The issue is Zach and Joe had a massive argument two weeks ago, to the point where Joe moved out of their house and is living with me. I asked them what happened and they both told me the same thing. Zach wants Joe to go to a medical school and become a doctor like him but Joe applied to a law school instead and gained admission. I have encouraged them to talk calmly. Hank, Zach\u2019s sister and I told Joe that if push comes to shove we will help pay for law school. We have enough money between the three of us to pay the tuitions, the costs of textbooks and the food, should his dad refuse to support him. But he should also give thought to talking to his dad. Their last conversation was basically a shouting match. We also told Zach that pressuring Joe to pursue a career he isn\u2019t interested in will only damage their relationship but he insisted on it, saying three generations of his family have been doctors and he doesn\u2019t want his son to be a \u2018bloodsucker.\u2019 Hank is worried that one of them might skip his wedding to avoid the other and asked me to help them reconcile since I\u2019ve known Zach longer.

And bear in mind that I am NOT close enough with this person for him to be making jokes like that and personally I think it's blanatanly rude for someone's first reaction to you telling them your MUMS age to be and exclamation of how rude she is! So I was like 'okay...that was a bit rude' and then the rest of my friends proceeded to jump on how I'm saying that being old is a bad thing and how I'm saying again isn't beautiful, none of which I think, aging is a beautiful and lucky thing to be able to experience BUT to call a woman  'old'- yes she's past Middle Ag but I would not say she's old? Old is 65-70+ personally- espeiaclly when that woman is my mum,of course it's rude! In my head, if he were to meet my mum and say that too her face, he wouldn't, because it's rude! It was then bought up again that next day and I again insisted Thata it's rude and also that my mum is not old.  A couple of days later I found out that, after they all jumped down my throat aggressively telling me how I'm ageist and that I'm being rude not them, M1 (the one who started this all)had said to my friend F1 that he would stop jokingly make fun of F1 if she were to agree with him that my mum is old. This means that even though they KNOW it's annoying me they still had this little agreement together KNOWING it will wind me up, to then get annoyed telling me I'm starting a fight (I didn't raise my voice or get angry,just defended my mum).

Keith used forearm crutches while I used a cane. Due to our conditions, we walked towards the back of our group. Neither of us had issues with this fact, however the teachers on this trip did. The second day of this trip, two teachers asked us to move to the front. The theory was that us walking in front would set the pace for the group. However, it instead made group members annoyed with us and did nothing. Multiple group members glared, muttering about it being unfair and it ended with everyone walking around us. The teachers started this by calling out, Hey slowpokes. After we shared our disdain for that they proceeded to call us, The ones with the third legs They also called us, Pace makers and Pace Setters Each time the group would move again, attention was brought to us as we were forced to the front. We tried to explain that this was not working out and was only causing more problems. Not only was the group annoyed with us, but we felt the need to walk faster, actively harming ourselves. The teachers refused to listen. Keith finally snapped at the teachers.They tried to force us to the front once more and we refused, saying it wasnt working. They stated that they didn't care if we didn't want the attention on us and to just move to the front. Keith snapped, yelling that it was not doing shit and they had no say over this matter. We were immediatley pulled aside. The teacher lectured us saying that we would not talk like that here but also that we are disabled and have to prove ourselves to the others and make them understand, ending with we are all on the same side. We both put our mobility aids away, but still ended up towards the back.Edit for clarity: We both have Eds and Pots which is why we use mobility aids. While we don't 'need' them to go places, without them we are both in immense pain and risk fainting. So we are able to walk short distances without mobility aids.",

        "selftext": "I have lived in a 5bedroom student housing unit with a shared kitchen for the last 3 years. When I moved in I brought a couple of things with me and also bought some new stuff (a dish rack, a really nice second-hand food processor, some plates and mugs and a several cake/bread tins). I have not kept the receipts for these things and never asked any of my roommates to reimburse me for anything but everything has been in the kitchen and available for anyone to use. I have also made sure not to throw away anything that I replaced so that I could take my things and put the old back when I eventually move out. However, the 4 other people who lived here when I moved in have since moved out and been replaced (the first about 2 years ago and the last 6 months ago). I will be moving out soon too and have therefor started to pack my stuff. After taking my things from the kitchen one of my roommates asked about it in our groupchat. I told the truth (that I have taken the things that are mine since I am moving) and several of my roommates got very upset. They either don't believe that the stuff is really mine or they think that it's silly of me to want to keep them since they are used and have been in the kitchen for long enough that they should belong to everyone. I don't want them to feel like I am stealing things but I don't really have any proof to give them. One of them tried to contact the roommate who recently moved out but they have not responded and I have no way to contact the other ex-roommates. So, AITA? Should I just leave everything? It isn't really about money since I'd say it's probably only $100 worth of stuff and I have a job whereas my roommates are all students, but I would like to keep my things. Are there any third options? Edit: Thank you to everyone who's commented, I think I might have just been stressed out bc of the move and overreacted to the situation. I feel much more secure in my decition to just take my stuff! To clarify something that's come up in several comments; there's a bunch of stuff in the kitchen that has been left by earlier tenents/might even have been put here by the student union that owns the place, so it isn't entierly clear if anything belongs to someone unless it's put in the very limited space (a singe shelf) that's been labled with our roomnumbers.",

        "selftext": "  Hi AITA Reddit, I have a bit of a problem kinda going on.. My name is Katherine, I'm F 18. I have high functioning autism and ADHD. My mom cooks certain things that make me sick and nauseous. Most of the times when I tell her I can't eat it she makes me eat it anyway and I end up throwing up later. I'm on a medication for my disorders. My meds will often make me lose my appetite or make my stomach hurt. The thing is that I don't come close to being a picky eater. For lunch my mom made some type of meatloaf with green beans and cheese. Just looking at it made me gag. Instead of understanding I just genuinely cannot eat that, she practically forcefed me and I've thrown up at least three times in the past two hours...I just ran away just a few hours ago. I still feel guilty asf. My mom didn't let me get therapy and controls me. Idk if I'm the asshole for not wanting to be around her and just run away.",

        "selftext": "My brother in-law (Sammy) lost his home shortly after his divorce 10 months ago. He moved in with us and brought his twin daughters (Olivia & Sloane18) with him a couple of months ago.His sister (my wife) and I have one daughter (Zoey 16) and she and her cousins aren't close but get along fine. Olivia & Sloane have no respect for Zoey's privacy, none. they used to walk into her room and take everything they get their hands on. Makeup, phone accessories, clothes, school laptop etc. Zoey complained a lot and I've already asked the girls to respect Zoey's privacy and stop taking things. My wife and Sammy saw no issue with this. After all, they're girls and this's typical teenage girls behavior. I completely disagreed.  Last straw was when Zoey bought a 60$ m.a.c makeup-kit that looks like a paintset that she saved up for over a month and one of the girls, Sloane took it without permission and ruined it by mixing shades together while using it. Don't know much about makeup but that's what Zoey said when she found the kit on her bed, and was crying.I told my wife and she said she'd ask Sloane to apologize but I got Zoey a lock after I found she was moving valuable belongings out the house because of this incidence!!! Sammy and his daughters saw the lock and weren't happy, the girls were extremely upset.Sammy asked about it and I straight up told him. He said my daughters aren't thieves!!! it's normal that girls of the same age borrow each others stuff he said Zoey could easily get another makeup kit for 15 bucks from walmart and shouldn't even be buying expensive - adult makeup in the first place and suggested my wife take care of this defect in Zoey's personality trying to appear older than she is.He accused me of being overprotective and babying Zoey with this level of enablement. I told him this's between me and my wife but she shamed me for putting a lock on Zoey's door for her cousins to see and preventing them from spending time with her saying I was supposed to treat them like daughters, then demanded I remove it but I said this lock does not get removed til her brother and his daughters are out of our house. She got mad I was implying we kick them out and said her family'll hate me for this. so I reminded her that I let Sammy and his family move in which's something her OWN family refused to do so she should start with shaming/blaming them for not taking their own son and nieces/granddaughters in. if it wasn't for her family's unwillingness to help we wouldn't be dealing with this much disturbance at home. Everyone's been giving me and Zoey silent treatment and my wife is very much upset over this.",

        "selftext": "I'll try to keep this short. I had a [1967 Impala 4 door](https://i.imgur.com/HLBPpTF.jpg) that I bought in Feb 2019. A couple months ago I bought my first house that had a 2.5 car garage. I moved the car in and started tearing it down for a complete restoration. I had the body in one bay and the chassis in another, plus the whole garage filled with parts. About two months ago my girlfriend came to live with me during this whole crisis and the whole time has hated that car. She wants to park in the garage but I have 2 acres of land with a lot of nice places to park under shady trees or hell even in the barn if it has to be inside. I tell her tough luck its my house and its not like I can just throw it back together real quick. Anyways I was out of town for a couple days on a business trip for the small local company I work for. When I got back, my girlfriend was all smiles. Making me food all the time, doing all the chores, all that. I though maybe she just was happy to have me home but then I realized that I didn't see her car in it's usual spot. I asked her where she parked so I could make sure I mow that area and keep it clean and she said not to worry because she parked in the garage. I asked how and she told me to go check it out. Turns out that while I was gone she hired some people to come over and move everything related to that car, including the drivetrain, body, and chassis and all parts, and take it to the local dump/scrapyard. I was absolutely dumbfounded. I had spent over 11k on that car including new parts, services, and the car itself. I told her that I was going to be taking her to court for that and she brushed me off like I was being dramatic. I told her that its done between us and to pack her things and leave. I admit I was a really angry but I did end up getting a lawyer, and as I have all the receipts for all that money spent and I have her on my house's security cam footage letting the guys in and watching them take it all I think I can win. Her family and friends are absolutely blowing me up saying its just a stupid old piece of junk and that she cannot pay back all that money I spent, and that I should just let it go. But I have been putting all my time, effort, and money into that car for a year and a half now and goddammit if I am not going to get justice for what she did. AITA Edit: Thank you all so much for the support and awards and everything. I'm glad I have some people on my side. I got a call from her mom about 20 minutes ago and she told me that i was ruining her daughter's life over a stupid car. I told her she ruined her own life. I've been gathering documentation and stuff and I'm about to head down to the police station and file a report, as suggested by lots here. Once again thank you all UPDATE : went to the police station last night, was told to come back in the morning. just got back and filed an official report against her for grand larceny and grand theft auto. i showed them all the receipts i had for the car and the footage of her letting the guys come and take it as well as the title for the vehicle in my name. they said they will be in contact with all 3 parties (me, ex gf, and junkyard guys) soon and they will hopefully be able to recover some or all of the car. just have to wait now HUGE UPDATE : THEY FOUND MY GODDAMN CAR!! the junkyard guys apparently were in the middle of hiding it when the police came to ask them questions. it was on a forklift and they were gonna put it on top of a pile of cars that was hidden behind more piles of cars. they said it was theirs and they had the title, but obviously didnt have the title for it and since they matched the vin on the chassis and body to the vin on my title, it was obviously mine. I know at least one person there has been arrested, i think he was in the camera footage i talked about earlier but idk if it was the boss or whomever or even his specific charge, they also told me they would be looking into this specific junkyard for any other vehicles reported stolen. they said they haven't been able to get in contact with my ex just yet but they're working on it. im just so glad they found my car. luckily i made quite an album of pictures detailing me tearing down the car and so i can use that to prove what parts they had were mine so i can hopefully get most or all of it back. police haven't let me take it back home yet as they say it is evidence or something so hopefully i can get it back eventually. thank you all so much for the support and advice!

        "selftext": "I am a high schooler with a weekend job at a coffee shop. My coworkers who work weekends are:  James - the owners son, he goes to my school. He's a shift manager but it's not a real formal thing, he's a friendly guy. Danielle - A college student who sometimes works weekends too. So sometimes customers will come in and just be angry about such little stuff. Like literally blow up about nothing. I dunno if theyre in a bad mood already and looking for someone to take it out on or what, but it's a lot... Like how sad so your have to be to be a grown-ass man taking your anger out on high school and college kids. So James and I were joking about having a little fun with them and hopefully getting them off our backs. So one day I was at work and some guy was having a temper about how we don't make the coffee hot enough... Which I couldn't do a thing about because I gave it to him right out of the machine. So James came in and was like sir is there a problem here and the guy started ranting at him too. So he was just like OP, this is unacceptable, you're fired.  I started acting real sad, like no please don't fire me, my family needs the money, I need this job, pleaseeee and he played up being a hard-ass, telling me to take off my apron and leave. The angry guy started to backtrack, like It isn't that big of a problem, you don't need to fire her over it. I didn't mean it and James was like No, we pride ourselves on the best customer service Of course after all that drama I still had my job, we were just acting. And we've done it a couple times, whenever a customer will lose their temper at Danielle or I, James will storm in and fire us. And almost every time, the person who had come in angry will apologise and say that they didn't mean it. It's kind of satisfying, making people realize their actions might actually have consequences.  Anyway, I was telling my friends from school about this and a few of them thought it was a mean prank, to let someone go away thinking they'd gotten someone who desperately needs the money fired.

I also work hand in hand with the doctors and midwives to create a healthy maternity, birth, and postpartum situation.  My fiancee is completing her residency.  We live together and have for a few years now.  We aren't in any hurry to get married.  We originally had plans to do so a couple of years ago but then we got really busy for two years.   It is driving my very religious parents crazy that their youngest son is living in sin.  I don't really care.  I'm an adult and I do what I want.  We are getting married in June.   So we are visiting my parents for Christmas. The way it came together this year everyone is at my parents house.  So that's my folks, my three siblings, myself and fiancee, and seven grandchildren.  So seventeen people.   At dinner my mom starts going on about how she is so glad that we are finally getting married and she won't be embarrassed at church any more.  And my dad says how proud he is of his three older kids who all either waited to get married before moving in together or got married right away after moving in together.  My fiancee was getting embarrassed and I was getting mad over this stupid argument we have had too many times. And a family dinner was the last straw.   I have asked them repeatedly to just accept that they cannot control how I live my life.  I refuse to stay with them when I visit even if I come alone.  Hotels are just easier.   So I started talking about a premature baby I had been reading about.  It was almost three months premature and weighed about 1.6 pounds. It was super strong and healthy for being born so little and the NICU had high hopes for the baby doing well.   My mom and dad both got deer in the headlights looks on their faces.  To bad. Should not have fucked around with my fiancee's feelings.   So I asked about my oldest brother.  He was born almost four months premature.  Is there a chance that we could check out the family album where we keep all the records of family births and stuff.   I already know my brother was over 9 pounds and almost 23 long when he was born.  My grandmother told me all about it the first time my parents tried to shame me.  The subject gets changed very fast.  After supper my parents told me that I should not try to embarrass them with private things that are not my concern.  I told them that if I heard anything about my living arrangements ever again for the rest of my life I would make sure to keep bringing up the FACT that my mom was in her second trimester when they got married. My parents are mad at me for telling them how to behave in their own home.  But my fiancee is happy that they seem to be off the subject for good.   AITA?",

I met the love of my life. We decided to tie the knot. From the beginning I told my parents how I am worried my sister will ruin another special moment in my life. My mom told me over and over again it would not happen. The day of my wedding. I received a voicemail from my mom saying they couldn\u2019t come because my sisters dog was sick and she was upset. I was hurt, my best man however is a jokester. He took my phone then went to my fianc\u00e9 and asked if he could post a video of our wedding as a gift? On social media. She loved his idea. I had no idea about it until I came home. Our honeymoon was at a lake side cabin. No cell service. The post caption was \u201cMy best friend. He is an amazing person even if his parents NEVER showed up for him.  video was still pictures of us next to her parents, me on the dance floor, cutting the cake. Where you would normally see both parents in wedding pictures. The sound behind the video was my moms voice mail explaining how they couldn\u2019t come because my sisters dog was sick.

I maybe the A here. I didn\u2019t take it down when I got my messages. I didn\u2019t call my family back right away. I waited until my vacation time was over at work and enjoyed my time with my Wife. In our new home. Before I contacted anyone. My dad told me to take down the video. It was \u201cjust a bad night for them\u201d. That they will make it up to me and my wife for not coming. My reply was exactly how do you plan to \u201cmake up\u201d my wedding? It\u2019s a once in a life time thing. You choose to ignore my feeling on the whole matter. Then he just repeated he will make it up to me. I told him I would take down the video only when he made up missing my wedding.

        "selftext": "About a week ago, my (39F) family ordered Chinese food for delivery. When the delivery driver came to the door, my daughter (16F) was taking the cat upstairs to put in her room because he always tries to eat the food. My son (13M)  loudly says, \u201cMake sure the hide the cat from the Chinese guy!\u201d as I am at the door getting the food from the Chinese delivery driver. He very obviously heard what my son said and was upset by it. I quickly apologized and took the food.  I told my son that racist jokes were completely unacceptable and very wrong and he refused to admit that he was in the wrong. So, later that night I forced my son to write a sincere apology to the delivery driver, (his name was on the receipt) as well as write a one page paper on Chinese culture and a one page paper on why racism is perpetuated by racist jokes and stereotypes. Then the next day I took him to the restaurant and had him read his apology aloud to the delivery driver as well as give him the papers he wrote. The driver was very appreciative of the apology and thanked me for making my son do it. He then told my son about multiple instances where he had faced racist comments and attacks from people while he was a delivery driver.  That night my husband (43M) and I got into an argument about me making our son do this. He told me that it was embarrassing for our son to have to do the apology and that the \u201cpunishment didn\u2019t fit the crime\u201d. I told him that it was much more embarrassing for the driver to have to face that kind of racism and racist stereotypes and that our son would get over the embarrassment. I do not condone any kind of hateful thinking in my house, and the fact that my son said that embarrassed me as well. My husband told me that it was \u201cjust a joke\u201d and it wasn\u2019t that big of a deal. I feel like I might have over reacted some but I think it\u2019s important to help my son understand how what he said was wrong and hurtful.",

We\u2019ve always been a meat eating family, we live in the rural Midwest and bacon for breakfast is pretty much a given. This year my 14 y/o daughter decided to go vegan, and I jumped onto her support team with enthusiasm. We learned how to substitute ingredients, cook new things, try new things, I adjusted our budget to include more expensive vegan substitutes for her, etc.  None of this has been a problem for me until recently. She saw me cook bacon in a pan, and then I rinsed it out to load in the dishwasher. She exploded in anger (teen years, I\u2019m not too fussed about the anger explosion, I know she doesn\u2019t mean it) and said that that was HER pan for vegan food. I was completely floored and said, kiddo this here is a family pan, older than you, it\u2019s not YOUR pan.  She asked me to purchase her a pan that she can solely use for vegan food. I didn\u2019t want her to feel weird about food, so I said sure, and ordered her a few colored ones that are only for her. The reason they\u2019re colored is so it helps me remember that I\u2019m not to touch them unless I\u2019m cooking vegan.  That wasn\u2019t good enough. Now apparently the dishwasher is \u2018contaminated\u2019 with animal product, and the fridge has \u2018bacon grease fingers\u2019 on it (because I eat bacon and then touch the fridge) and she\u2019s asked me and her mom to completely stop eating meat at home. I don\u2019t mean I literally touch the fridge with greasy bacon hands, because I wash my hands, but it\u2019s clearly enough that it upsets my daughter.  frankly I\u2019m on team hell no, her mom is much more amenable and strongly wants me to consider taking our daughter up on the request. My wife\u2019s reasoning is that both our parents live close so we can eat meat products there, and that she doesn\u2019t want our daughter to feel uncomfortable in the kitchen. My daughter says she is fine with cheese and butter in the fridge, but it\u2019s specifically meat products that make her feel sick. Now I\u2019m sorry for her, but I feel like she just needs to adapt and live side by side, because I\u2019m not going to stop eating bacon in my own house.",

        "selftext": "So it was my birthday couple months ago. Had a party. Got some gifts. My friend \u201cMandy\u201d for me a \u201csuper cute bikini\u201d. I liked it. Said thanks. She had ripped the tags off but whatever.  Anyway. Went to the community pool with my roommate. Wore bikini. Got in the water. Roommate immediately is like uhm girl.... I look and see that this bikini is now kinda see thru.  Haha good joke Mandy.  Anyway, Mandy invited me over to her place to hang out with her and her bf and a few others. Most leave and we\u2019re still hanging out. I\u2019m like hey, what if we get in your hot tub? I go change after them. And meet her bf in the hot tub she\u2019s getting new drinks. I hop in. Immediately, he\u2019s looking at my chest. I pretend I don\u2019t notice and just make small talk. She comes out a few min after. And just looks in shock. Eventually gets in. \u201cUhh is that the one I bought?\u201d Yeah I love it. I wear it everywhere. Make up some stuff about how I wore it to the beach, some party with lots of guys, etc. and she\u2019s just like \u201coh\u201d.  We\u2019re in the tub for 20-30. Eventually get out and change. She approached me after and was like. \u201cUhm I\u2019m sorry thought you\u2019d notice. But it goes kinda see thru\u201d. I\u2019m like yeah I know why\u2019d you buy me a ducking see thru bathing suit? \u201cShe\u2019s like it\u2019s a joke. Wait you knew?

        "selftext": "I was over my boyfriend's apartment this weekend and I was cooking dinner because he was studying for exams. I made pasta and a chunky sauce with meatballs and veggies. I told him dinner was ready and he goes what's for dinner tonight, B*TCH ... With like a lot of emphasis on the last word.  I was fed up, I'd had a pretty rough day with work and I have some awfully bad associations with that word being used by other people in my life who were pretty abusive. So I was so irritated that I dropped the pot of pasta sauce I'd been carrying right on the ground and was like Well nothing's for dinner tonight now. And I better not hear you using that word again, it's for the girls He was freaking out about how sauce had landed on his rug and he even said you're seriously acting like a bitch right now, I dunno what else to call it I just walked out and got takeout for myself and went to my friends house. She thought it was funny but my boyfriend was furious, he kept texting and calling and sending me voice memos trying to explain that saying what's for dinner tonight b*tch was a TikTok trend.... And that he was just quoting something as a joke to put on tiktok.  I thought that was the shittiest excuse ever, it doesn't matter if he saw it as a joke, or stole the joke, it was still disrespectful.  But it didn't change the fact he thought that shit was funny, to demean me when I was trying to do him a favor. Like hell I came over when he was studying to make a home cooked dinner and he decides it's time for jokes? So I put my phone on don't disturb for the night and split a bottle of wine with my friend and her roommate.  The next morning he was sending me angry texts demanding I clean his rug because he was too busy with exams to do it. I was shocked he left it overnight, that's disgusting. I texted him back saying. Yeah so that's the b*tch tax honey :) leave me alone till you're ready to handle your own cooking and cleaning because this b*tch isn't anymore. Also it's vile you left that soaking in all night He called me and told me that he was okay with doing his own household work, but I did throw a full pot of sauce at the ground so that's on me to clean up.  I told him yeah no I'm not comfortable doing chores for you if you see me like your b*tch  He told me he didn't and it was just a trend and I got pissed off he was playing that TikTok trend BS excuse again and I told him Well I'm starting a trend called 'saucing' where as a little joke people throw pasta sauce around! You can't be mad because it's just a little trend, a little jokey joke, just a little prank bro!  He got really pissed off and hung up on me and now I'm seriously wondering if this dumb fucking tiktok joke is gonna be the end of things between us AITA for how I reacted when my boyfriend asked me what's for dinner tonight, b*tch Edit to address a comment I've gotten a lot and I don't have time to reply to every time: > But did you tell him not to call you a bitch? Like how would he know otherwise? Honestly if someone has gotten to the age of 30 and not realized that women (as a whole) do not like having demeaning slurs used against them... They're beyond my help.  This isn't something that needs to be told. I shouldn't have to go through life like Hey man just in case you were thinking I might like demeaning slurs against my gender used on me, I don't actually :) And if you were about to comment something like that, let me just tell you in no uncertain terms... WOMEN DO NOT LIKE BEING CALLED BITCHES BY MEN. DO NOT CALL WOMEN BITCHES. IF YOU NEEDED TO BE TOLD THAT IS UNKIND, CONSIDER YOURSELF OFFICIALLY TOLD. NOW YOU HAVE NO EXCUSE TO NOT UNDERSTAND",

        "selftext": " Context: My sister (F27) and I (18F) lost our dad a year ago. He was my only parent, mom was never in mine or my sister's life. Dad left money (inheritance) for me and sister and she used her inhertance to get new cars and renovate her houseI live with my aunt right now cause my brother inlaw didn't let me stay with my sister. I'm planning on using my inhertance money to pay for college tuition (I've always wanted to be doctor but haven't decided which branch yet). My sister & I haven't been close, it started after she got married to her chronically ill husband who was allowed to make backhanded comments about dad and mock his llness and make a scene at his funeral.only because he's ill and shouldn't be held accountable for his behavior.I've distanced myself But my sister kept visiting alot lately venting about my brother inlaws condition. He's been in & out the hospital for heart problems and in need for a surgery. She brought up my inheritance money several times but I end up cutting the conversation. She then straight up asked if I could help pay for her husband's surgery and she'd pay back in less than a year. I felt uneasy cause if I give her money from my inhertance which is a large amount then there's no gurantee she'll pay back before It's time to apply for college. I'm taking a year gap but I know my sister can't pay back that much and I felt I was risking my future. I refused to help and she had a melt down at my aunt's house calling me heartless, cruel with no empathy. She said that her husband's health should be a priority and I needed to help because education is nothing compared to someone's health and asked if I'd be happy to see her as a widow and my nephew with no father.My aunt suggested others pay but most of them cut my sister and her husband off. I argued that her husband's poor health isn't my fault after she kept blaming and guiltriping me. She kept crying and although my aunt decided to stay out of it she said that I should be prepared for permenant damage in my relationship with my sister if I don't help her now.  She's been sending texts and pictures of her family telling me this is what I was saying no to, a happy healthy family with a healthy husband and father. I cried and felt like I was being selfish not good aunt and sister. I asked my friend and he said let them sell the cars and all the luxurious stuff they bought to afford the surgery and warned me if I give them money I'll never get it back and may not be able to go to medical school.",

        "selftext": " I F30 don't have the best relationship with my husband's mom. Since day one she tried to make remarks and compare me to her ??. She then tried to get on my good side and started overly praising everything I do and sometimes even copying me like that one time when she LITERALLY dyied her hair purple just like mine and when everyone pointed out how ridiculous she looked, she actually blamed me and accused me of trying to make a joke out of her.  So, Anyways! My husband and I took 2 weeks off work to go visit some places out of the country - tourism in other words. Thing is I was the one who saved up for and arranged for the trip (my husband was responsible for booking the tickets). My husband's mom wanted to come along and threw temper tantrums when I said no. She called, texted, sent people to talk to me into letting her come, even threatened to call the police and make some complaint up to get us to stay if she can't come. My husband said we should just take her but I told him he was wrong to tell her about the trip in the first place. He gave me an ultimatim. said he wouldn't go if she can't come and I told him I'd gladly call his bluff which made him take his words back and say FINE! I will tell her to stop it because we won't take her. Things got quieter, suspeciously quieter. the day of the trip came and we got to the airport at 2pm. My husband was walking ahead of me and was looking left and right like he was looking for someone. I asked him but he didn't respond. He lead me to the waiting area and first thing I saw was his mom standing there with her luggage . I froze in my spot, I felt a cold wave washing over me and I was fuming inside. She and my husband were hugging that's when I quietly turned around and started walking towards the exit. My husband followed me while shouting at me to stop. he tried to stop me but I told him off the harshest way possible. He tried to say I was overreacting and that his mom was there anyway and I should let it go and not mess the trip up for us. I told him he and his mom could still go and that I was going home. I went home and sobbed into my dog's fur for several minutes. turned out he booked her a ticket without me knowing. an hour later he came home yelling and raging about how pathetic and spiteful I was to walk out and go home and ruin the trip last minute. I told him he caused this to happen. he said that I was being so hard on his mom it's ridiculous. I refused to fight any more but he kept on berating me then called my family to tell them that the trip was cancelled and that it was because of me. My family said that I shouldn't have ruined it for myself and should've sucked it up and done my best to enjoy. Did I really overreact?",

        "selftext": "So, Ever since I had my son months ago, my husband has started making indirect comments about my body. He never says any hurtful words but I find his observations as he calls it hurtful. For example, he'd see me wearing an old top and say oh that top used to look good on you but not anymore though... or when he looks at my waist and says Wow, didn't know your waist could get this wide!. Basically passive stuff that I tried to ignore til it extended to friends and family. FYI this went on for months and months and months!!.  We went to christmas celebration at his family's home. My SIL complimented my floral maxi dress and my husband said I agree it looks nice on you...though I have to admit that your waist could get smaller than this!. Awkward silence took over. I was absolutely fuming and this was my last straw. So I got up from my chair in the middle of dinner and shouted at the top of my lungs SHUT THE FUCK UP ABOUT MY BODDDYYY!!!!. He was absolutely speechless as his family stared while some others tried to get me to calm down but situation got more tense and dinner ended up being cut short and my husband storming off to his friend's place to spend the night upon leaving a very nasty text saying I embarrassed him and made a scene over an observation he made. He called me childish and told me to get therapy for my insecurities instead of verbally abusing him and scaring his family.  Now I feel like an absolute idiot asshole and like I ruined christmas for him and everybody with my over sensitivity. AITA??",

        "selftext": "So my son had a long-distance gf recently for about two years. She was great, a really nice girl and we all loved her welcomed her with open arms. She was flying here constantly to visit him, like a weekend a month and he didn\u2019t lift a finger to go visit her.  I tried talking to him about it several times and told him he should really start looking into flying over to her instead of expecting her to do all the travelling. He said no. And my wife probably had something to do with it as she constantly told him she was afraid of him flying. I spoke to them both and said this girl is great for him, she was willing to move over to our country too, but said there was one condition and that was he\u2019d have to fly over to her country too. Which is fair enough.  He said no, he didn\u2019t want to fly or travel anywhere. My son was becoming lazier and lazier, eventually telling his gf and us that he was perfectly fine never travelling anywhere including holidays etc.  Last week, he told us she\u2019s dumped him. I went on her fb page as we\u2019re all still friends (she wrote us an apology letter about how she\u2019s upset it didn\u2019t work out but these things happen, so we\u2019re on good terms) and looks like she\u2019s with a new guy already. Me and my wife have no doubt she was seeing him whilst still in a relationship with my son.  I confessed to them both that I actually agree with her decision and he should have expected it. He did not treat her properly and I hope he learns lessons for the next one because he needs to make more of an effort. I said he deserves it for his lack of effort in the relationship and for essentially just allowing this girl to spend all her money and time coming here all the time.  Wife and son are very upset that I said this. Very very upset and my wife says I am being horrible.  AITA? I stand by what I said.",

        "selftext": "**TL;DR at bottom** For context: I've been married to my wife for ~10 years and we're a mixed-race couple (I'm Asian and she's Caucasian). I've gotten along with her family (MIL, BIL, SIL), but I always felt like her FIL and other SIL (Sarah) never liked me. I'm a professionally trained chef with 15+ years of experience and I work at a high-end Chinese restaurant (a spin-off of a popular one in Beijing) in a large US city. My crew and I have won several awards, and I've been explicitly told I'll be the next executive chef. Sarah is also a professionally trained chef and works at a popular upscale French restaurant in the city. She constantly brags about it and (no joke) compares herself out loud to Ramsay and Bourdain. Whenever I'm at my MIL and FIL's house and helping out in the kitchen, Sarah is *always* criticizing everything I do. Whether it's chopping, braising, marinating, etc., she always butts in with comments like Umm, I think you should actually do X like this.... I've been patient for my wife and side stepping those comments, saying things like Thanks, but I think I'll stick to the way I do it. Things came to a head two weeks ago when my wife, FIL, MIL, and I were in her parent's kitchen prepping dinner for my MIL's birthday. We were running a bit behind so things were heated (which I kind of like because it reminded me of work) and that's when Sarah walked in. She took one look at what I was doing, scoffed, and said something like Oh wow, okay, so that's not the right way of doing things. It hit a nerve and I pretty sternly told her to stop criticizing my cooking and that I'm also a chef like her. She laughed and said making Kung Pao chicken at some Chinese restaurant doesn't count. The kitchen went silent, FIL snorted/chuckled, and my MIL yelled SARAH WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU. I stopped what I was doing, swore at her and called her a racist piece of shit, apologized to my MIL for not being able to stay, and left for home with my wife. Apparently this caused a massive fight after we left, with my MIL/BIL/other SIL taking my side and my FIL/Sarah saying it was a joke but kind of true and that I was being too sensitive. The extended family somehow got wind of this and now everyone is arguing and taking sides, with my wife even getting texts from some her cousins apologizing for Sarah's behavior. Despite being on my side, my wife is begging me to apologize so that the fighting will stop but I refuse to because fuck Sarah and her blatant racism. AITA? **TL;DR:** I'm a chef working at upscale Chinese resto, my SIL is a chef at upscale French resto. She's critical of my cooking skills and has now called it making Kung Pao chicken at a Chinese restaurant. Family at war, wife begging me to apologize, what do? **EDIT:** My wife has also informed me that now Sarah may be in trouble at work and she's blaming me for it. Apparently one of her co-workers heard her rant about what happened and reported it to management. (Edit: To clarify Sarah is blaming me, though my wife is partly blaming me) **EDIT2/UPDATE:** So it looks like one of my wife's cousins found this post and put it on Sarah's Facebook wall going This is you right?.... Her FB friends are starting to comment with things like If this is you Sarah then I'm disappointed. I think Sarah's still at work - shit might be hitting the fan soon and now my wife is pissed too. Will try to update but might have to delete post if things go nuclear **EDIT3/UPDATE2:** Was considering removing but I just got a voicemail from my FIL that [my] presence was only being tolerated up until this point and threatened a world of hurt if I didn't delete this post. Officially going to keep this post up and if you're still reading this Doug - I'm very disappointed in you, you're better than this. Will also continue to update and thanks again for all your support folks **EDIT4/UPDATE3:**  *Lots of stuff just went down* 1. My wife got a call from SIL. (From wife's paraphrasing) Sarah started screaming/crying at her the moment my wife picked up and said that she just got demoted because of [her] {Asian slur} husband. Apparently some of her co-workers have her on FB and showed the post to management, which combined with her earlier rant, double whammied her back to being a line cook and now she might get fired. My wife told her to go fuck herself and is now solidly on my side after taking the verbal abuse from Sarah and reading some of the comments here. My wife is still the opposite of happy though...2. Wife called MIL and asked her WTF was going on with FIL. MIL was confused so my wife played back the voicemail I had on my phone and apparently my MIL literally just walked away from the phone without hanging up and started screaming at FIL.3. Facebook post has now devolved into a clusterfuck flame war with family and friends jumping in. Suffice to say, it has officialy gone nuclear [Me right now](https://i.imgur.com/8QnGdHK.gifv) I think I'm going to have to call this a day, will make an update post when the dust settles. Thanks again folks **EDIT5/UPDATE4:** Turns out I'm not allowed to post an update post for some reason:> No, you provided all your updates in the original post with your many, many edits. You can edit this in, but we will not be allowing a standalone update on this. *I'd like to clarify that I got my wife and MIL's permissions to post this update (out respect for them and their privacy)* Suffice to say, it's been kind of nuts this past week. My wife and I had to turn off social media for a bit because of the shitstorm caused by her cousin putting my last post on Sarah's Facebook page. Some people even tried to call the restaurant I work at to get me fired as retribution, but luckily everyone there is 100% on my side (or as my boss put it Fuck [Sarah], fuck those racists, fuck them so goddamn much). I guess it didn't help them that half the calls involved threats, screaming, and more racial slurs. We didn't hear any updates from her family, even though we assumed the shit met fan after MIL found out about FIL's threatening voicemail (*still disappointed in you Doug*). But that changed on Sunday night, when MIL suddenly showed up at our door with overnight bags. After we took a moment to help unpack and calm down, she spilled the beans on everything. **FIL (aka Doug)** Apparently my MIL and FIL were already having trouble in their marriage, and it was only made worse with a certain 2016 Presidential election (she's a Dem, and he had apparently gone more far-right since then). Seems that a line was crossed with the Kung Pao Incident and his voicemail. When he refused to apologize for anything (typical Doug), she asked for a divorce and he went beserk. She didn't feel safe there so that's when she came over (other BIL and SIL live out of town). **Extended Family (aka The Great FB War of 2021)** You may have been able to tell already, but the extended family was largely arguing/fighting/divided along political lines for a few years now and my cousin's FB post was likely just the light to set off the powder keg. According to my MIL, the fallout has allegedly already led to some break-ups, excommunication of some family members, and even an argument that ended with police involvement. Haven't verified this myself though. **Sarah / SIL** According to my MIL, Sarah came over to her place on Friday. The writing was on the wall and she was basically forced to quit. Despite her trying to start from scratch as a line cook, the entire staff turned against her. Nothing was coming back from the (dish) pit for her and she was getting the cold shoulder. She\u2019s a great chef (I will admit this is true), but they took no chances since it turns out (shit you not)... they're partly owned by a Chinese investment company. Found this hard to believe and didn't want to add this detail, but it turned out to be true after some research (won't say any further for privacy). Word also got around in the local industry, and Sarah is essentially blacklisted from high-end establishments. She's now considering selling her home and moving to find work. As much as I don't like her and found her behavior horrifying, I didn't intend for this to happen so I've reached out to some buds in other states to see if they had any openings. Whether or not she wants to take itis up to her (and no, she has not apologized for anything either - but I still want to be a decent person to her). It sure as hell doesn't feel like a happy ending. Perhaps bittersweet justice, but that's all I can give you. Thank you all for your support and for reading.  [Still me right now.](https://i.imgur.com/8QnGdHK.gifv)",

        "selftext": "I was raised by parents who believed (religiously and just culturally) in rigid gender roles. Dad should work, mom should stay home with the kids. I\u2019m the only girl and have 3 brothers.  Because of their expectation I\u2019d stay home with kids, they never valued my education, educational achievements or emphasized things beyond domestic skills. I\u2019m the second youngest. By the time I was in high school, my two older brothers had gone to the college of their choice, with my parents fully covering tuition, books, an off campus apartment and other living expenses. They eventually did the same for my younger brother. I was told I wasn\u2019t allowed to apply for college. I did so in secret and got accepted with a partial scholarship. I didn\u2019t tell them I was moving out until a week before I left, with essentially nothing but what a few friends gave to me that their parents bought \u201cthem\u201d for college. I took engineering, and had to work, take on debt and struggle. My parents and I have barely spoken for years. I\u2019m married now and expecting our first child, and they asked to meet up. We met at a park, and they said they were \u201csorry if they caused me pain\u201d but would like a relationship now. I asked them specifically what they were sorry for. They wouldn\u2019t elaborate and just said they wanted to move forward. I said that wasn\u2019t sufficient. In the end, I said they could prove they were sorry by forwarding me the $100k my degree and college expenses were, just like they did for my brothers. My mom burst into tears, my dad said I wasn\u2019t being serious and I just left. Since then, I\u2019ve been getting calls from my brothers telling me I\u2019m being immature and hurtful.

        "selftext": "New to reddit, please bare with.  So I (21, guy) live with my childhood best friend (22, also a guy) and have done for 2 years now. Up until last week, things were perfect between us.  However, he recently got a new girlfriend (23, lady) and she honestly seems absolutely great except for one thing; she seemingly has a complete aversion to knocking. She and I have quite a lot in common, and I actually like spending time with her. However it bugs the hell out of me when she just barges into my room without knocking first. Now, she's never walked in on me doing anything untoward; I'm usually just chilling on my bed or studying at my desk. However, on at least seven seperate occasions now she's done it first thing in the morning to ask if I want coffee. I sleep naked. Every time prior to the last one, I've been under the covers and she hasn't seen anything. I always point out that she *could* have and she just giggles and says but I didn't.  When she stayed over last week, in order to make my point, I intentionally slept on top of the covers. Sure enough, she barges in at 7AM, begins to ask if I want coffee and sees my you-know-what. She immediately backed out of the room and didn't speak to me for the rest of the day. My mate later pulled me aside and said I was bang out of order, accused me of deliberately exposing myself and pointed out that I'd threatened to do it before (I literally just said okay but what if I had no covers and you saw everything before). They're now framing this to others that I'm some sick creep who intentionally got naked and lay in wait of her because that's how I get my rocks off, and I'm kinda seeing how it came off that way. AITA for doing this?",

        "selftext": "The title makes me sound horrible but hear me out.  My sister is severely autistic. She requires attention almost 24/7 and cannot be left alone. She is non-verbal and cannot take care of herself at all. Despite the fact that she is only 12 she is extremely destructive and violent and destroys anything she gets her hands on.  I hate her. That should be wrong to say but it doesn't feel like it.  I was only 6 years old when she was born and since then i've never solely had my parents attention. Even since I can remember the world has revolved around her. I was moved out of my room into the basement at 7 because she needed to be in the room next to my parents. All of my toys as a child were destroyed by her and my parents simply ignored me when I complained. Even when I was 14 and she destroyed a mac my school gave me I was in the wrong.  Along with this I am expected to take care of her and drop everything I do for her. I can never make plans with friend because my parents expect me to be there if they need me to take care of her. Even when I do somehow get time to myself I am required to leave if they need me. If i do not then I am punished. The recent example of this is when I went to see the new spider man movie, and was grounded because i turned my phone off in the theater.  It seems as if I am nothing more than a slave to them and anything involving her simply overshadows me. This last week I was chosen to give a speech at a school event. I was so exited and my parents promised to be there, but they never showed and claimed it was because of my sister. Anytime anything like this happens for me they are to busy with her.  I've held this in for so long and it finally spilled out today. While talking about colleges with my father, he joked that I should get a degree that pays well so when their gone I can take care of my sister. I don't know why but this caused me to break down. I cried and screamed about how it always about her. I'm nothing more than a caretaker to them, that they always make it about her and that I'm expected to be her slave for the rest of my life.  I've locked myself in my room since then and my parents have not come to check on me. Am i the asshole here?  Edit/Update kinda: Wow, thank you for all the support and love that you guys have given me. I never expected this post to reach the popularity it did. Thank you all. After thinking about it for these past hours, you are right that I don't despise my sister. It's not her fault that she was born the way she is. My parents came to talk to me a while after my break down but I was unable to bring myself to talk to them and only cried and asked them to leave. They have made arrangements with my grandfather for me to stay with him for the time being and am getting ready to go to his house. My parents want to talk to me but we have decided it's best I leave for now to have some space and time to collect myself. we will be sitting down and talking later this week about this issue. Thank you all again for the love and support through this <3  I'll send an update your guy's way later this week if people are interested. ",

        "selftext": "Me and 2 other guys share an apartment together and we split all the bills. The only thing we don\u2019t split costs on is groceries. Everyone\u2019s in charge of buying their own food and we don\u2019t touch whatever doesn\u2019t belong to us in the fridge. We put our names on everything so no one gets mixed up.  This issue has been going on almost a year and I\u2019m sick of it.  One of my roommates, R, keeps stealing my food. I get home from work and containers with my leftovers are sometimes missing (they have my name written on it), or my stuff finishes too quick. My gallon of milk for example. I buy almond milk because I like the taste. But it seems to finish after a week even though I\u2019ve only drank once or twice.  I confronted R about this lots of times and that\u2019s caused a lot of arguments. He outright denies it and tells me I\u2019m crazy even though it\u2019s so obvious.  My other roommate and I carpool together because we both work the same early morning shifts around the same area so I know it\u2019s not him. It\u2019s always after we get back home and R\u2019s already left for work that I notice my food\u2019s gone. My roommate\u2019s also had a similar problem but not as often as I do. I\u2019m guessing cause R doesn\u2019t like what he buys. The funny thing is R buys a lot for himself and is even more stingy about his food. He will literally point out what\u2019s his when he comes back from grocery shopping and tells us not to touch it. Last week, my milk was nearly empty again and I got fed up. I went to the liquor store and bought regular dairy milk. I drank what was left of my almond milk and refilled the gallon with the one I bought. This was to catch/prove R is the one stealing since he\u2019s lactose intolerant.  The nxt day, Saturday, we get back from work and R is pissed. He yelled at me that he was stuck in the bathroom for 40 mins with diarrhea because of my milk; he was using it to make a shake. I only responded with \u201cSo then you\u2019re the one who\u2019s been stealing?\u201d  He freaking exploded. Yeah he admitted he was \u201csometimes\u201d drinking my milk and eating my food but he was more mad that I switched milks than the fact that he was caught. I told him I wouldn\u2019t have done that if he\u2019d just stopped taking my stuff from the fridge or at least told the truth instead of tryna make it seem like I was making it up. My roommate backed me up and thought it was kinda funny he got payback for stealing from us. It\u2019s a little tense rn and my roommate told me R is trying to convince him to agree to kick me out. Little does he know we\u2019re both looking to move somewhere else together cause we are sick of his shit.   I told some buddies what happened and a few think I was an asshole for that. I feel like I\u2019m not in the wrong here. He was taking my food and not even owning up to it and I wanted to prove it, does that make me TA?",

        "selftext": "I 23m was repeatedly stuck playing the part of helper and babysitter on family outings. I had to move out of my parents' house because I kept being forced to help watch my three nephews. Last year we took a family vacation in summer to the coast. I rode along with my parents, and they paid for my hotel room. Only, I had to share that room with three rowdy boys because my sister and her husband wanted a room to themselves. I was promised time to do my own things on the vacation. But instead I ended up having to help with these kids. I complained to everyone about it, and was reminded I was there for free. And then we pretty much just did only one thing I wanted to do. Which was tour an art gallery. I like doing this whenever I'm at the coast. But the kids find it boring. This year my parents have a beach trip planned for June. And they assumed I'd be riding along the same way as last year. But I refused. I said I'd be driving myself, and paying for my own hotel stay to have my own room. My parents were shocked, and tried to remind me of the cost. I said it was no worry. I've got a good job and a decent running car. I can more than afford it. That's when the Buts started. I stated the previously listed things as why I'll be driving myself and paying for myself. I want to be able to enjoy this vacation as an adult, and not be treated like a child like last year. My parents told my sister, and she called to blow up at me that I'll be ruining the vacation if I'm off doing my own thing while she has to wrangle her three boys. I ended up yelling at her that last year all she did was rope me into her mess. I didn't really get to do much of anything I wanted to do. And I was treated like the bad guy for wanting to just go to an art gallery. I'm a grown man. I deserve my own vacation too. Now my sister is not speaking to me, and my parents are still trying to convince me to just ride with them to keep the peace. I'm still refusing. But the pressure is getting to me. AITA for not giving in? I know they'll have a pretty hard time when they won't have another person there to help. Edit: It's barely been an hour since I posted. But my sister is apparently a reddit lurker in the mornings, and she saw my post. Not only is she furious with me. But she's also upset no one in the comments is siding with her. To make it short, she went on a big rant about how it's so hard to be a parent to triplets. And the least I could do is help because I'm young and single, and she needs a break. I stood my ground on my decision, and now she's calling our parents to get them involved. I'm expecting a call from them any minute. Update: Well I'm off work now, so I can tell more of what went down. I guess you could say it's over. My sister got our parents involved, they looked at my post, and were absolutely horrified by the continuous influx of commenters. Yes they're very angry with me that I posted here. But I told them that if they'd just listened to me to begin with, I'd have never needed to. I'm sick of the whole keep the peace mentality that sacrifices me to placate my sister. They in turn went off on my sister, and to make a long story short the whole vacation has been canceled. The hotel wasn't booked yet anyway. But my parents are arguing with my sister, my sister is blaming me, and my nephews are crying because they aren't going to the beach. My sister called me at lunch and basically implied I have no life, which is why I have time to help. I recorded that and told our parents, and that's currently what they're fighting about. Smol Update: I wasn't gonna update again. But here's a little more. Parents said that they won't ever push babysitting of my nephews on me again, and have agreed that what happened last year was unfair to me. Right now they're VERY angry with my sister for telling me I should help her because she thinks I have no life. My sister is playing the victim. And my brother in law is basically saying Nope! to the whole mess and spending most of his time at work.  Thank you to everyone who has commented. You made my day.",

        "selftext": "My (23F) wedding was back on Saturday December 31st and I'm still getting backlash from this, so I want to know if this was an AH move. In the country I live in it's currently winter, and we get a fair amount of snow so my wedding was a winter themed wedding. The color theme was forest green and gold. My dress was obviously white, and I chose the color of my bridesmaids dresses to be forest green as well. My MOHs dress was black, and everyone was to wear gold accessories.  I have this friend, we'll call her Kat, that I asked to be one of my bridesmaids. When we went dress shopping and I told them the color theme I was going for, Kat immediately expressed that she thought forest green was a bad choice. She said the thinks it's not a flattering color, and thought I should choose something different and more girly. I said no because my wedding was winter themed and I thought the color would go perfect with the theme. She suggested a pink, blue even a red. I said no, but thanks' for your opinion. She found out my MOHs dress was black and asked if she could wear black too? I said no, only my MOH is wearing black.  I paid for all the dresses.  Fast forward to wedding day, everyone's getting their hair and makeup done and Kat show's up 30 minutes late holding a bag that looked like it had a dress inside. I asked her what this was for? She told me it was for later on at the reception if she got uncomfortable and wanted to change after pictures. I was like ok cool. So fast forward we're all dressed and walking down the stairs because the ceremony is beginning in 30 mins and we were going to take some pictures before. Kat is the last person to come down and she's wearing a BLACK DRESS. At the time I was preoccupied taking pictures with my parents, but my MOH came over to me and made me aware of the situation.  I confronted Kat and asked her what was going on. She said she hates her bridesmaid dress, as the color is ugly and makes her look gross so she's wearing black. I told her please go back and change. She refused and started walking away from me. I said I'm going to ask her one more time, and if she doesn't oblige I'm calling security and kicking her out.  She began yelling at me to fuck off, so I called security and asked them to please escort her out. She started making a BIG scene yelling how I'm such a bitch, that I can't force her to wear anything and that I'm a horrible inconsiderate friend.  The wedding went on and it was truly amazing. Ever since the wedding Kat has been blowing up my phone with texts saying some really nasty thing's and asking for the money back she spent on the black dress, since it was a waste and she didn't get to wear it. I had to block her number. Some of my other bridesmaids have been giving me shit saying that it was a little harsh kicking her out and embarrassing her like that. And that maybe I should give her the money back. AITA for kicking her out?",

It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family.  My ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf.  She was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board.  Long story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?",

        "selftext": "My boyfriend had to go to the ER after a accident, and he got a truly ridiculous bill back. I offered to fight the bill for her because I've done it before, and he said sure.  I went all-out, because honestly if we were out 5 grand, after insurance, that would fuck up our holiday plans pretty bad.  So I... - had him call the hospital and authorize me to handle his bill and access his medical records.  - got an itemized bill and compared the prices for each code to the fair prices - called billing to dispute the bill, but was told that billing only collects bills, I'd need to contact admin to dispute - bounced around a call center for hours trying to get someone who was actually qualified for bill disputes, and getting nowhere  - google and linkedin searched for the hospital board of directors and upper management  - got 30 emails of the most influential people at the hospital, plus the hospital's investors - every day would send a few emails, working my way up the chain, and writing an (increasingly long) email describing how they billed my client at 7 times over the fair price for services rendered, and how their billing department, customer service department, and the growing list of management I'd emailed, had failed to address the issue.  - escalated the emails until I was writing the director-level staff with the entire board of directors and a number of outside investors CC'd, asking for a written statement regarding their justification for billing at a rate 7 times higher than the national average, for commensurate services to what is available at other hospitals. And sternly laying out the failures to appropriately respond, at every level of the company.  Well, once I'd done all that (which was honestly only like 15 minutes a day) they reduced the bill... From $5000 to $26. Yep, twenty-six fuckin dollars.  Well, I told my boyfriend the good news, and he was at first overjoyed and blown away, like literally jumping up and down and hugging me and saying I was literally a Christmas miracle.  But then when he asked how I did it, I said it wasn't too hard, I just had to send a couple emails each day. He was curious what I'd said, and I handed him my phone.  He started to get stressed, and flipping back through other emails. Which there were like 60 of. He told me I went way too far, he was expecting me to dispute through their billing department or something normal and reasonable like that, not internet stalk every single manager and board member and investor and harass them into dropping the bill.  I was frustrated because I'd just saved us 5 grand, actually made it possible for us to afford a nice Christmas and save some money, and he was mad at me because I'd been a bit of a hardass?  I was furious, and he was also mad at me, saying he authorized me to dispute a bill, not basically threaten and harass a whole damn hospital for weeks.

        "selftext": "One of my (29M)  best friends \u201cCarla\u201d (31f) is getting married soon. It\u2019s only meant to be a small backyard type of wedding but they\u2019ve been planning it for a few months now and originally it was supposed to be on my property. They wanted it because it\u2019s private, has lots of open space for the reception, a nice view and the house could be used for them to get ready and stuff. Of course I said yes, she and her fianc\u00e9 \u201cRick\u201d were very happy. Thing is Carla and I do have a history. We went out on & off in college but decided to stay friends. Then I met my wife, we got married, Carla met Rick and now here they are. Now my wife knows I went out with Carla back in college and she didn\u2019t care. Carla still went to our wedding and everything. I never knew if Rick was told or not, it\u2019s not my relationship therefore not my business to say anything so I never did. Rick found out recently and not in the best way. Not sure how but from what I heard from friends is that one mutual friend told him (no idea why) we used to date. Not only that but apparently Carla said a couple years ago she was still in love with me when she was already dating Rick. Don\u2019t have actual confirmation if that\u2019s exactly what he was told. All Carla\u2019s told me is that Rick was told about our past and he\u2019s angry at her for never saying anything.  It became quite a drama and didnt hear from her for over a month until now. She told me they\u2019re going to couples counseling and that the wedding is still on. But Rick requested that I not attend. It sucks but I totally get why he wouldn\u2019t be comfortable. Then I asked the obvious question, where are they going to hold the wedding then? To my surprise she said they still want it at our place.  Rick said so to and in my mind I\u2019m going \u201che doesn\u2019t want the guy who dated his fianc\u00e9e  years ago at the wedding, but still wants the wedding at his house.\u201d My wife and I are expected to just...not be at our home that weekend, And I told Carla no. They\u2019re going to have to find some place else since we\u2019re not going to simply leave our home to them for the weekend. Not only for safety reasons but it just doesn\u2019t make sense. Rick doesn\u2019t want me around because he\u2019s not comfortable but is comfortable enough to have their wedding at my house? They really want their wedding here though and because of that I\u2019ve been bugged by not only her but also Rick and some friends who think I\u2019m being a petty asshole for not letting them have the wedding here anymore. Honestly don\u2019t think that I am, it just doesn\u2019t make sense at all to have to leave our own place for a wedding we\u2019re no longer welcome to and leaving our home totally vulnerable. Still, being accused of sabotaging their wedding and Rick believes it\u2019s the least I can do after everything. AITA?",

        "selftext": "I (19f) study drama at uni, and my boyfriend is on the same course. My boyfriend is a really good-looking guy, but he doesn't seem to know it. He gets a lot of attention from girls and for the most part, doesn't seem to get that they're flirting with him. I'm not generally annoyed by this, and never really say anything. However, there's one girl in our class, let's call her Victoria, who is obsessed with my boyfriend. She goes out of her way to be paired with him in group activities (for example, if the professor picks groups by numbering us 1, 2, 3, she will move herself to be in the same number as him) and she recently stepped down from a main role in a play we're doing so she could be in a more minor one, simply because this character has a romance with my boyfriend. I know this is the case, because I've heard her say to her friends that she thinks he's hot and what not. I've never said anything to her about it, because she seems pretty insecure (always complaining about how she thinks she's ugly) and I don't see it as a big deal because my boyfriend doesn't care. However, we recently performed the play and had a small afterparty where she got slightly drunk and was bragging about how she 'definitely felt something' when they kissed in the play and she's 'going to ask him if he felt the same'. I rolled my eyes and again ignored it, until she actually went up to my boyfriend. She was a little bit drunk, and when she went up to him I was there too. Victoria started saying that she knows he must have felt a spark, he's a really good kisser, etc. I snapped, and sort of shouted at her that 'you sound incredibly desperate, going after somebody else's boyfriend. You're pathetic if you think a stage kiss means you should be together.' She looked super embarrassed and walked away, and I later heard she'd gone home crying. I feel like a dick because she's obviously insecure and whatnot, and her friends haven't stopped calling me a bitch since. AITA? Edit: She 100% knows that I am his girlfriend, I have heard her talking about me being his girlfriend before.",

        "selftext": "Some backstory: I had been dating my ex fianc\u00e9 Sarah for four years. We had been planning to get married in November 2020 but I found out at the start of this month that she cheated on me. She begged me to give her another chance but I broke it off.  The problem was that being cheated on is, in my mind, completely emasculating and humiliating. So I never told anyone that was the reason we broke up. For obvious reasons, Sarah also didn\u2019t tell people we broke up because she cheated. So people have \u201cblamed\u201d me for the breakup, including my mom. They just see that I dumped her out of the blue.  I\u2019ve gone very strict no contact with Sarah after I discovered she was cheating on me. Sarah has been talking with my mom and has convinced her that if we could talk one more time, we would be able to reconcile. My mom has been applying hard core pressure on me to talk with Sarah but I\u2019ve explained that there\u2019s no chance we will ever get back together.  So tonight I go over to my mom\u2019s place because she\u2019s hosting family for Christmas Eve. I\u2019m there for a bit talking with my aunts and uncles and cousins when the doorbell rings and I can see it\u2019s Sarah. I ask wtf is going on and my mom says she invited Sarah so we can work this out in the spirit of the holidays.  I\u2019m pissed now because the only way to explain my side of the story is to tell everyone I was cheated on. Complete humiliation in front of my whole family. So as my mom goes to the front door, I go into the bathroom. My mom starts knocking on the door saying that I need to come out and talk to my ex like an adult. I say fuck it, kick out the window screen and get in my car and go home.  My mom called a short while ago saying she\u2019s cutting ties with me over my behavior (she\u2019s really fixated on me jumping out of a window) and that Sarah will always be like a child to her. My sister called me after to ream me out for ruining Christmas. I broke down and told her that Sarah cheated on me which is why I dumped her and didn\u2019t want to see her under any circumstances. She called me a big asshole who was lying to cover for myself.  Am I really in the wrong?",

He's willing to miss the dr appointment over soccer or a drink or board game with friends. His response is always I'm not the one carrying the baby, why do I have to go see the dr with you?. Last week was my final straw. He was supposed to come with me for the baby's gender reveal appointment but he chose to not come last minute because his friend invited him to fish 'n' chips meal. I was pretty livid but didn't make a fuss about it. Mom went with me instead.  He texted asking me to tell him the results (boy or girl) but I refused to tell him. He kept spam calling me but I hung up each time. He came home fuming demanding I tell him the results but I refused and bluntly told him, since he refused to attend the appointment then he gets no results til after the baby's born and said I was wiling to die on this hill. He went off calling me spiteful and immature for doing this and punishing him. He said he's the father and has the right to know. He then called me dramatic since I wasn't alone and mom was with me. I said he gets no results period. He's been fuming about it and told his family and they're now pressuring me to stop playing mind games with him and tell him but I declined.  AITA? EDIT/UPDATE: Hi, so, first of all, wow!!! I did not expect this to blow up. Sorry, can't answer any comments because of feeling overwhelmed...um I just wanted to mention that my husband just attempted to contact my dr to get the results.

My brother 'Chris' (M) and his wife (F) have a 3 yro son who everyone calls miracle or rainbow baby. He came after several failed pregnancies that lasted for years.  When they found out that my nephew was included in the no children rule; they tried to convince me to make an exception for him. Chris told me his son is a miracle baby and his presence at the wedding will bring blessings for me and my fiancee. I refused and said no, the wedding is childfree. His wife kept sending my fiancee pics of my nephew when he was months old (what that mean??). I told them no, and to stop. My brother told me this might cause a rift in our relationship, I again said no and explained that the wedding is childfree. He asked again and pointed out how his baby is different since he's a rainbow, a miracle baby. I again said no and explained that the wedding is childfree. They brought it up when they visited at my home and I knew they weren't going to stop so I'd made flash cards in advance with the phrase the wedding is childfree, period and pulled them out and started slowly showing them the flash cards one by one in this order:  - The wedding (with a sticker of bride and groom).  - Is Child (with a sticker of a baby).  - FREEE (with a sticker of a \ud83d\udeab sign).  - PERIOD (with a huge, black dot sticker).  They both were stunned. I asked if they get it now and Chris had lost his shit. His wife had already grabbed her stuff and walked out. Chris called me an asshole for doing this and said that I disrespected him, his wife and their son who's my one and only nephew. He rushed out after we argued. My fiancee saw the whole thing and thought that it was funny but my parents and Chris are livid beyond measure.

        "selftext": "Ok this is the worst. I\u2019m losing sleep over this. I\u2019m getting married in a week to an awesome woman, and I cannot wait to be her husband, we are so excited. My brother is gay, but my family doesn\u2019t know, only me and my parents know. I come from a very old school traditional family, so the old part of the family, grandparents and some aunts/uncles still have last century\u2019s mind, and the younger portion, cousins/sibilings are open minded, and are living in the present. So my brother has been dating his bf for 6 months now, the dude is great, I\u2019m so happy my brother found a great guy. But it\u2019s kind of a secret, as he hasn\u2019t told my family he is gay. I\u2019ve been telling him for years that he should come out, cause I know it stresses him a lot, and I think it will make him feel better not to hide anymore, plus I bet a few family members already know anyway. But he disagrees cause he knows a part of the family won\u2019t accept it and it will be a lot of drama. I see the opposite, I see it as the sooner you know who the idiots are, the sooner we can cut them from our lives. I have no interest in having someone in my life that doesn\u2019t accept my brother being gay. Anyway, that\u2019s his decision not mine, so for now he won\u2019t say anything. Until a few weeks ago, when he said he wants to bring his bf to my wedding. I was not expecting that to be honest. So he went from 0 to 100 pretty fast. If it was any other occasion I would be supportive obviously, but I don\u2019t think my wedding day is the day to do that.  Imagine all the drama and gossip and bullshit that would happen. And I don\u2019t want to get the attention away from my fianc\u00e9e, that\u2019s her day. And I dont wanna have to worry about that on my wedding day, and I think it\u2019s a pretty good reason I asked him why my wedding day, he said it\u2019s because he wants to celebrate love with the 2 people he loves the most, me and his boyfriend. This is killing me. I would fight my whole family for my brother and never speak to them again if I had to, but my wedding day is supposed to be a celebration, not a family fight, and I can\u2019t do this to my wife, that might ruin our future.  I didn\u2019t even tell her, she is already stressed out, dont wanna make it even worse With a heavy heart, I asked him to please come alone to the wedding, and that I hope he understands me. He  started crying and left my house without saying anything. Next day I got a text and he said \u201c dont worry, going alone\u201d. I tried calling him but he didnt answer  me, and my parents don\u2019t seem to know what\u2019s happening because they didn\u2019t say anything. He eventually called me back a few days later, we spoke, he said he understands my side, but things are still weird between us This is the worst situation of my life, am I the asshole for handling it the way I did? PS 1: I wanna thank the redittor that sent me a private message and said they hope a mass shooter shows up at my wedding, so thoughtful!!! PS 2: Thanks for the gold and stuff! Update: spoke to fianc\u00e9e, couldn\u2019t keep this from her anymore, she agreed with me. Clarification: I know it won\u2019t be my brother that would cause trouble. The trouble would start with remarks and looks from some aunt/uncle. Doesn\u2019t matter, we are spending a lot of money on this wedding, planned it for a long time, my fiancee put her heart and soul into planning this wedding.I don\u2019t want to see my bride or mom crying, or some idiot uncle insulting my brother. Literally every other day of my life I will support my brother\u2019s decision to come out. Even at the wedding, I would obviously defend him. But the point is, NOT AT THE WEDDING. Also, MY BROTHER IS NOT THE ASSHOLE. Not at all.",

She lived with her father in London where she was educated. She went on to attend university and became a doctor  She married a British man, they moved to America and had a great life. She funded the education of as many of her neices and grand neices as she could.  When she passed away she left money for every girl relative she could.  My parents managed to access the accounts that were set up for my sister and I. They used it to pay for my brother's wedding. My sister didn't care because she got married two years out of high school and had no intention of going to college.  When I graduated I went to the bank to get money for school and it was almost all gone.  There was like $13,000 left.  I asked my parents about it and they said they had needed the money. I finally found out where the money went. I got furious. I got student loans and moved out. I am a great source of shame to them and I don't give two fucks.  I am currently suing them for the money that was left for me. My entire family is against me. They all think I am a complete asshole for airing private family business in public. And that I am putting money ahead of family. My friends are all on my side but they are all Americans and don't really get my culture.  Neither do I to be honest.  My brother called me up and offered to pay for my university if I drop the lawsuit. I agreed as long as we had a legally binding contract. He said I was being an asshole for not trusting him. I said he should not have accepted my money for his wedding. It is causing all kinds of embarrassment in our community.   I am somewhat ashamed to be doing this but I don't want to have this debt I should not have.",

        "selftext": "I (26f) recently moved into my first home. I am also 4 months pregnant with our first baby. The pregnancy has been very hard. I have horrible morning sickness. It reached a really bad point where I passed out hit my head and my Dr admitted me to the hospital for a week.  When I got home my husband allowed his brothers family to move into 2 of our 3 bedrooms. (They were evicted i dont know why). One room was My office was tossed into our room papers every where. The house was a complete wreck. Trash, dirty clothes, used diapers. I started to cry. It was like a light flipped my husband was no longer the same.  My husband told me it wasn't that bad. My reply was fine then you should have the house cleaned up before I wake up. Completly exhaustedI fell asleep for 4 hrs. I woke up and went to get a drink of water. I couldn't every glass we own is scattered around the house. They didnt clean a single thing. I passive aggressively started to pick up the dirty dishes and washed them. The following morning. I was trying my best to work when their kids were crying non stop. Banging on the walls so on. Their mom was in her room for hours ignoring them.   When my husband came home. He was upset with me over how I didn't make his brother's wife feel welcome in our home. By helping with their kids when she was tired. Then continued to complain how nothing was done while he was at work all day in the house. Yep the same one he didn't clean. That lead to a fight where I told him. I am too sick to have company and they need to leave.  To which he replied they are his family and he won't kick them out. I started to cry again.  I was beyond frustrated, exhausted, I physically couldnt do it anymore. I called my mom asking if I could come stay with her. Telling her the whole story infront of my husband. Who at this point was completely shocked, Angry, also I could tell he wasnt sure what to do. My mom came with my brother's (I have 3 older brothers). My mom super angry told my husband. Since your family can stay so can we. My mom quickly took charge. I was sent to bed. My brother's started cleaning complaining loudly at how disgusting my BIL family is. Along with what a horrible husband my husband is for putting me through this while I am sick. I got a text message from my MIL for calling me an A for not helping my husband clean up the house and putting my BIL in a uncomfortable position by having my mom boss him around. Edited to add update, when my MIL showed up she was super angry outside. I could hear shouting but, couldn't understand what was said. Once inside she was shocked. My house looked really bad. My BIL lied to her about what happened. My MIL quickly started to help my mom in the bossing mode.My house is not just cleaned but deep cleaned. My BIL and his kids are now staying with MIL. She didn't know about the eviction. My in-laws helped them financially a couple of months ago. My MIL was not happy about it. SIL refused to come out of the bedroom. She would scream through the door but that was about it until her family came to pick her up. Last little bit. I did talk to my husband. He seemed very remorseful. I asked for some space he is staying at a hotel. He asked to come by and talk to me tonight.  My mom and dad are here. Both mom's felt like I should have someone here since I am sick.Both moms have set up a meal plan. Where they trade off who will bring in dinner. It was my MIL idea. Thank you for all your advice. I truly appreciate it. Talk with husband: summed up since it lasted 4 hrs.  it was a hard talk.  He is remorseful.Bil was only supposed to stay for a couple of nights. Then leave originally he thought they would be gone before I got home. He said he is tired and emotionally upset himself. When I originally passed out. My husband left to help a friend move. He came home and found me. He said he has no idea how long I was on the floor hurt. He was originally scared I had died.Since then he has had nightmares. On top of dealing with his family drama. He admitted to dumping his frustration onto me. When it's not my fault. He begged me for another chance. The next steps. We are still separated. He plans on staying at my brother house in his casita. We are going to go to marriage counseling and Individual counseling. He asked if he could come when the home health nurse comes each night and to my Dr's appointments. I agreed to that. Update on BIL: his wife admitted to having and affair. She told him she got married too soon and doesn't want the responsibilities of being a mom anymore. I am not sure what will happen with him and his kids but, I am shocked that she feels this way especially with her kids.",

        "selftext": "My dad passed away 2 weeks ago. Me, my wife 'Candace' and my daughter (16) 'Shiloh' and her stepsisters (19) & (17) flew to my hometown to attend the funeral. After that we got 2 hotel rooms (one for me and Candace, one for the girls). While I was in the room, I got a call from Shiloh at 11pm crying and sounded like she was arguing with her stepsisters. I asked what the matter was and she told me that her stepsisters insisted that she sleep on the floor (there were one large bed in the room and there was enough space for all 3 girls to sleep on). I asked why and she said she didn't know. I went to see what the issue was and talked with my stepdaughters about it. They kept talking but didn't really explain why they told her to sleep on the floor. They just shrugged and said It's better this way...we're more comfortable this way... I told Shiloh to grab her things and when one of my stepdaughters asked where we were going, I told her I was booking her a hotel room. Both looked upset but didn't say anything but they must've called their mom because she was awake when I got back and started arguing with me about giving Shiloh an entire hotel room for herself. I explained why I did it but she said I wasted money and that Shiloh could've sucked it up for one night on the floor. I called her unreasonable for saying this but she told me I showed the girls that I'm playing favorites and made my stepdaughters share a room while I gave my daughter and entire room for herself. We went home and Candace is still bringing it up saying I mishandled this. She even pointed out how my stepdaughters are upset since they're not speaking to me. ETA It was Candace who got a room for the 3 girls as to not stir any drama and save money. She was in charge of hotel reservation since I was emotionaly distressed. Also. Candace did NOT expect Shiloh to sleep on the floor. She wanted all 3 girls to share the bed.  ETA#2 For those that are calling me an ah for giving my daughter her name. Her mom did that and she's deceased so please let's not focus on that. And also, I've known my stepdaughters since they were little. We're pretty much family and Candace is a sahm but I give her full access to my money since this stuff was already discussed before handed. Pretty much everything was.",

        "selftext": " I (M/37) have a 13 y.o son. I was a widower when I met my now wife. She has a 16 y.o daughter from another relationship. The family is often on pretty good terms. My son is the quiet one in the house, he keeps to himself a lot but not to the point of being concerning. My wife and stepdaughter are the complete opposit. They both encourage him to be outgoing and share activities and join gatherings with extended family. My son complained about having to be forced out of his comfort zone and having his need for space invalidated. I spoke to both my wife and stepdaughter and asked them to give him space and freedom to spend his time however he wanted. they apologized and promised to let him be. As mother's day was approaching I wanted to throw my wife a surprise mother's day celebration. It was no longer a surprise because my stepdaughter gave her the heads so she could prepare. Yesterday I got off work earlier than usual to get final arrangements done (we planned to celebrate at the restaurant and invited her family there) I had the key and while I was entering the house through the front door I overheard my wife and stepdaughter talking to my son. My wife was asking my son if he could convince me to let him stay home and not go with them to the restaurant to celebrate. I paused and decided to keep listening. My son said why and she told him that his introverted and socially inept attitude will make her family uncomfortable and will ruin the mood. He promised her that he'd be well behaved and would try to interact and socialize with everyone but she said that she wasn't buying it. He kept reassuring her but she snapped and told him that technically, she's not his mom so she didn't get why he wanted to celebrate mother's day with her so badly. My stepdaughter threw some (I don't remember) backhanded comment and then both of them were shocked to see me standing there. Both were staring without saying anything. I told my son and his stepsister to go to their rooms then told my wife that the celebration was off, cancelled. she tried to argue asking why repeatedly and I told her why. She tried to explain that she didn't mean it like that and that I only heard part of the conversation but not all of it. I told her I was done arguing and the decision was already made. She yelled asking what she was going to tell her family and said that I was making tremendous mistake towards her. I ignored her while she kept throwing tantrum after a tantrum. Early this morning she took my stepdaughter and went to stay with her folks. not a single call or text from her so far. Situation is full of tension. I'm upset still but more hurt to be honest. I mean yes I did say I was going to havw this celebration but I thought that what she said to my son was too harsh to ignore.",

        "selftext": "I've been married to my wife Beth for 5 years. I have a bio daughter named Jessica (she's 18). And I also have two stepdaughters named Monica and Leah. They're 25 & 28. Both are single moms and live with us currently. there's been issues about my stepdaughters asking my daughter to babysit the kids. Jessica didn't have a problem with it at first since this is what she does to earn money but since her stepsisters don't pay her much, she'd just refuse to babysit. We worked this out by having my wife take care of paying for the babysitting. I planned a family vacation for 3 days and everyone wanted to go. However, Both Monica & Leah suggested that Jessica stay home and watch the kids since Beth doesn't want her grandkids to come. They said it's because the kids are used to Jessica and hiring another babysitter would cause issues. And also said that Jessica isn't too fond of our destination but it was obvious that Jessica wanted to go. They insisted and Beth offered to pay her double and there was just..a lot of back and forth on this til I demanded they stop bringing it up. We were supposed to go last week but when everybody had bagged their bags and was time to go, Jessica found out that she didn't have her passport on her. We searched her bag then went home and searched there. Beth and my stepdaughters kept insisting that we go back to the airport or else we'd miss our flight. They insisted that Jessica stay at home with the kids. They even told the new babysitter to go home cause she was no longer needed. I refused to go and kept searching for the passport til Monica admitted that she helped Leah hide Jessica's passport to get her to stay home with the kids. I was livid I tried to get her to tell me where it was but she said Leah had it, Leah denied so I threatened to cancel the vacation that's when they gave it back. I decided to actually cancel the vacation and blew up at both of them and berated them. They stayed upstairs for a while and Beth refused to speak to me and said that I punished my stepdaughters for worrying about their kids and wanting them to stay with someone they know. I got told I overreacted and ruined the trip for everybody. Editing to mention that kicking my stepdaughters out isn't possible since my wife co-owns the house that we currently live in.",

        "selftext": "I wanna preface this by saying that I f34 married my husband m37 a year ago. His mom is snoopy and annoying af. She can't help it that is just how she is as my dear in laws say. My husband and I purchased a new house recently. My MIL kept pushing to get an emergency key, She promised that she only use it in an emergency but giving the fact that she had an emergency key to our old apartment and walked in on us being intimate twice (but my husband didn't think it was big deal) I just couldn't trust her so I just sent her a fake key (after she kept pushing) and she had a smug on her face after I hand delivered it to her. Days gone by and on Christmas dinner MIL angerily called me out on the fact I gave her a fake copy of the house key. She shamed me for doing this in front of everyone but in my defensive I asked her how she found out and she said days ago when she came over at 4 while my husband and were out. I reminded her didn't you promise you wouldn't use it unless there's an emergency? So You tried to get in when there was no emergency and you broke the promise you made to us! She looked red in the face and the other family started staring and some even laughed at her for the face she made. She suddenly got up from her seat and rushed into the kitchen where she had a huge meltdown so loud the next door neighbors must've heard - literally I've never heard a 60+ year old woman throw a tantrum like that. Needless to say dinner went awkward and my husband and his sister were giving me looks. My husband went off on me in the car and said I lied and manipulated and humiliated and exposed his mom and said he wouldn't have let me get away with it had he known. We had an argument and he is demanding I apologize to his mom for my childish behavior and for ruining Christmas dinner for the whole family. AITA? Eta so this went off unexpectedly and I thought I'd show my husband some pretty helpful comments I found here minutes ago but he got mad at me when he saw it and said I was nuts to talk about his family online. He demanded my phone so he could delete it but I refused and I went upstairs and into the bedroom. I never seen him so agitated and I didn't think he'd react like that honestly. But thank you guys for your support. It really means so much. I'll update if I can. Thanks again :)",

He\u2019s been with this girl for six months and throughout the time we have gotten close because we both like hair, makeup, and shopping. I never knew there was anything wrong with their relationship except when she texted me last week I saying she would love to hang out but thinks it\u2019ll be inappropriate because her and my brother broke up. I asked her why and she said she was sick and tired of \u201cauditioning\u201d to prove she was with him for the right reasons. She went on to say that my brother is paranoid she\u2019s after his money so he would test her like 1. Leaving out his bank statements on their bed and getting upset when she picked it up 2. Going out to eat at high end restaurants he requested and leaving his wallet on home at purpose to make her pay the bill and prove she\u2019s not going out with him for money 3. Never buying her gifts and questioning her when she asks why he doesn\u2019t.   I was shocked so I had to hear my brothers perspective. We spoke and he told me everything she said was true and that there\u2019s nothing wrong with making sure his girlfriend is with him for the right reasons. He said he left his bank statements on the bed and was peeking through the door to see if she would be curious and when he saw her pick up the papers he knew in his gut she was using him for his money, so he set up the restaurant idea to see if she would get upset at paying a 500$ bill which she was. I asked him if he thinks her being an elementary school teacher could\u2019ve contributed to her being upset at a 500$ bill at a restaurant he wanted to go to and he said no. He said the straw that broke was when she asked him why he hasn\u2019t bought her a single gift since they\u2019ve started dating when she bought him a gaming console and new rims for his car and he knew she was just discretely asking him to buy her an expensive gift.  He confronted her and said he thinks she\u2019s with him for his money so she said let me do us both a favor and dumped him and blocked him. He\u2019s upset about the \u201cgold digging bitch\u201d and when I laughed he called me an asshole. He said I would never understand what\u2019s it\u2019s like being a rich man and being used and I get that concern, but I told him if he thinks any woman will be okay with his tests and auditions he\u2019s delusional as hell. If he doesn\u2019t want to be used for his money he should start dating people as wealthy as him or leave lower income people alone if he\u2019s not going to be genuine in his relationships unless they pass his \u201ctest\u201d.",

She remarried when he was 14. I did when he was 16.  I had an RESP set up for him. That's a education fund in Canada. As long as he went for post secondary education he could use the money for anything.  I always told him that I was okay with him not going to university. That way I could use the money I had saved up for him to go to Belgium and buy some beer from monks that only allow you to buy one case. He knew I was joking and he always played along. He wouldn't let me get his goat.  When he got accepted to McGill it was the proudest moment of my life. I took him out for a beer to celebrate his achievement and mourn the loss of my trip to Europe.  My son was struck and killed by a drunk driver in March. I'm dealing with it. My ex is dealing with it. My wife has been nothing but my rock in this. She is holding me up.

I said I was going to do what I always said I would. I was going to Europe to drink beer. She asked if she could have it for her step son. I thought about it and said no. Her husband is a decent enough person but he made it clear that he wasn't responsible for any expenses for my son. Beyond food and shelter and stuff obviously. Like I said he is decent.  I said I was not going to do that. I was going to go drink beer in my son's honour.  She says I'm wasting thousands of dollars. And I guess I am. I have to give back the government portion of the fund. But I don't care.  My ex thinks I'm being stupid and irresponsible wasting my son's money like this.  I don't care.

I had written this on my lunch break and was completely blown away and brought to tears when I checked back in after work. Several people reached out with helpful resources, including a litigator on Reddit who put me in contact with a colleague who practices in my state. Apparently there is precedent and people have won against the state although it did take several years.  My intent was to answer more questions since I wasn't able to do that while at work. I was also going to post the website as that has been a popular request, however I've been told not to continue further discussions beyond what I have already posted if I wish to pursue a civil suit.  Just a couple things I want to address in my update here. Some people are saying I'm leaving out details. My original post was much longer but there's a 3000 character limit imposed. I had to delete a lot of things from my initial draft so I apologize if it looks like details have been left out. I did try to make sure everything that was relevant was kept. Lastly, my son is now back with me. There was a lot of paperwork and even a court hearing, but we're together now and that's what counts.  I'm sorry if I didn't respond to your comment or private message. I'm still going through my unread messages and still have quite a lot left to read. Truly, thank you from the bottom of my heart for your support, words of encouragement, and advice that you sent my way. I can't even begin to put into words how grateful I am. Again, thank you so much to all the kind strangers who went out of their way to help.  ---------------------------------------------  Back in November 2018 I was arrested at work in front of my boss and co-workers. It was the most humiliating thing I've ever experienced. I later learned at the police station that I was being charged with multiple felonies. This came as a huge surprise. Luckily I was able to keep my wits and lawyer up instead of speaking with the detective. For $13,000 which completely wiped my savings, I was able to retain a criminal defense attorney. However it cost me everything and I was unable to pay my bond. This resulted in me staying in jail for a total of 54 days. At a status hearing, my attorney presented video evidence of me gassing up my car 3 hours away from where the crimes took place and I ended up having all my charges dismissed. When I finally got out I learned that I had lost my job, was in the process of being evicted, and my son was in the state's care. His mother is a heroine addict and I haven't spoken to my own parents in nearly 15 years. They wouldn't let him go to my girlfriend because they didn't consider her family.  Since my release, I've learned that I can't sue the police and no one gives a shit that I was locked up for 54 days because the detective did poor investigation work. I've gone to the local press about this and was told that what happened to me happens quite a bit. They took down my info but never followed up. So what I did was create a website sharing my story. I also uploaded the police report and some other documents from the discovery. Literally the only reason why I was arrested was because an eye witness said they saw me. If the detective had done his job, he could have verified that I wasn't even in town on the day the crimes took place. This is what pisses me off the most. My life was ruined because of a lazy employee.  I'm writing this now because my website is now ranked #2 on the first page of search results when you type in my town's name. I live in a touristy town and we attract a lot of visitors over the summer. My web traffic has more than quadrupled, and apparently it's gotten someone high up's attention. I received a cease and desist letter recently, which I showed to my attorney. He said sharing my experience online isn't illegal and that everything I had stated was a fact or my own opinion, protecting me from a defamation lawsuit. Yesterday I received a visit from two officers and the detective who had arrested me. He apologized, stating mistakes can happen. They then talked to me about my website and asked if I could remove it. I said I would delete it on the condition that the detective leave his job and never do police work again. Suffice to say that isn't happening.  After the visit I received, I'm more pissed off that the only reason the detective apologized to me was to get me to take down my website. I don't plan to and the only one supporting this is my girlfriend. My friends think I'm being spiteful and have suggested that I just delete it. AITA for keeping my website up? Edit: Grammar",

        "selftext": "My wife and I bought a four bedroom house in PA that my son lives in.  Our son went to College in PA and wanted to stay in the area.  So we bought the house as a second home, we live in NJ and commute into Manhattan for work.  We figured that he would have a place to live and we could visit every so often and spend some quality time together.  We pay the taxes and services / maintenance on the house, our son pays for his groceries and the house utilities. All was going well for a few years, our son meets a girl and they get serious. We met her and she seems nice enough.  The announce their engagement and she moves into the house with our son.   Now for the problem: The wedding !!!  We hold a little get to know you BBQ at the PA house, my son and daughter are there, as are our sons fianc\u00e9 and her parents, and sisters.   We all seem to be getting along well, my wife, daughter and the fianc\u00e9 go into the house along with her mother an sisters and my son.  A few minutes later my wife and daughter come out and are really upset. The come over and tell me we're leaving and driving back to NJ.  I try to find out what happened.  Once we get back to NJ and they calmed down they tell me that our son and his fianc\u00e9 along with her family don't want us at the wedding.  According to what I was told We're not their kind of people.  I was livid, I called my son and asked him WTH this was about.  He tells me that her family feel that we are not good enough and will embarrass them at a family wedding and that we are all uninvited from the wedding.   I let a week go by to calm myself down and drive back to the PA house, the new future in-laws are in the house along with the fianc\u00e9.  It appears that they all moved into the house They ask me why I'm there, I tell them that since we aren't invited to the wedding, I was coming over to talk to my son.  They tell me to leave their house.  I lost it, and told them that they had 30 days to get out.  Tell my son I'm selling the house and he could find somewhere else to live with all of you.  I go to a realtor in town and list the house for sale.  They call my son at work and tell him what I said.  Apparently they thought that he owned the house. He calls me and asks why I'm selling his house, I tell him I paid for it along with the taxes on it and it is mine.  He was living there rent free, but since he doesn't want us in his new life, he has to get out.  I tell him the same as I told his future in-laws they have 30 days to get out then I'll get a lawyer and get them evicted.  Am I the AH for taking a hard stance on this.  He is my son but thein-laws seem to take over and we no longer count.",

My birth-mother got pregnant and had to tell her husband as he was overseas when I was conceived so there was no way I was his. A few months after I was born they decided not to divorce. I was given to my grandparents on my mothers side to raise with my birth father secretly paying child support without his wife's knowledge.\r\rBoth my parents had other children, my dad's side knows nothing about me but my siblings on my mum's side were told that I am adopted by my grandparents. Recently I decided that I wanted to know more about my dad's family and I sent a friend's request to one of my siblings and my dad so I could get to know him. Well he freaked out and contacted my birth mum and they asked to speak to me over Skype. They both told me that they couldnt risk staying in contact with me and told me that they were going no-contact and to please respect it and move on with my life. \r\rWell I did pretty much the opposite. I contacted my dad's wife and shared screen shots of our conversations and told her everything. She is now divorcing him while on my mother's side I told both my siblings who then went on to tell extended family including her husband's side so now they are seperated and my siblings hate my mother. \r\rCurrently my siblings on both sides lives have been upturned and after the satisfaction has worn off I feel like I unnecessarily hurt them through my parents.

        "selftext": "I (37M) have three girls; 8, 10, and 12. Their mother walked out on us for another man when our youngest was around 4. My ex still stays in contact, though, and pays child support. A few weeks ago while doing laundry, I saw red spots on my oldest's underwear. I asked her if she knew about it, and she cried and told me she tried to call her mom, but my ex didn't call back. She'd been stuffing toilet paper in her underwear, hoping that would work. I explained to her that periods are nothing to be ashamed of, and found some great resources online for us to review together. I took her to the store to pick out brands of feminine products she wanted to use (she picked Playtex Sport because she's a gymnast).  After we were done, I decided I should do the same thing with my other two. My 12yo volunteered to be part of preparing them, and we made a whole night of it; it was wonderful, and I learned a lot. I even learned what a menstrual cup is, and how they benefit the environment. The other day, my ex called back. I'll usually arrange a video chat and leave the room so they can have some alone time, and when they're done chatting, I'll come back in to talk boring co-parenting stuff like school, bills, etc. This last time, my ex was FURIOUS with me for talking about periods with the girls. She shouted at me that I was sick and perverted, why didn't I call her myself if I knew it was so urgent, I could've called one of their grandmas/aunts, but my mom has dementia, while her mom and sisters call me a loser because I teach kindergarten, so I'm not fond of them. My ex told me I was being immature and should have just toughed it out for the girls. This really pissed me off, so I shouted back that maybe if she wasn't such a deadbeat and answered her goddamned phone once in a while, she could have handled this. I brought up everything she does that hurts them; she hasn't been to a single soccer game, piano recital, or gymnastics meet in two years, every other weekend when they come home from her house, they go straight to their rooms, only to emerge hours later asking me why she loves her new husband more than them, and what did they do to make her leave. My ex responded by saying I should tell them it's not their fault I couldn't satisfy her, and I screamed fuck you, and she just smirked and pointed behind me, saying Look what you did When I turned around, my 8yo and 10yo were standing in the doorway crying. It broke my heart; I never shout, so I know I scared them. My 12yo stormed in and started screaming at her mom, and while I appreciate her sticking up for me, this is not a battle I want her fighting. My ex hung up before I could fully deescalate the situation, and let's just say the girls have been given free reign of the ice cream and limitless hours of video games, because I feel so bad. I even watched all the Twilight movies with them, so don't say I don't love them. But in this instance, AITA for shouting?",

        "selftext": "I'm not really a photographer, I'm a dog groomer. I take lots of photos of dogs all day to put on my Facebook and Instagram, it's my thing if that makes sense. A cut and a photo with every appointment. I very seldom shoot things other than dogs even if I have a nice set up. A friend got married a few days ago and wanting to save money, asked if I'd shoot it for them. I told him it's not really my forte but he convinced me by saying he didn't care if they were perfect: they were on a shoestring budget and I agreed to shoot it for $250, which is nothing for a 10 hour event.  On the day of, I'm driving around following the bride as she goes from appointment to appointment before the ceremony, taking photos along the way. I shoot the ceremony itself, and during the reception I'm shooting speeches and people mingling. I started around 11am and was due to finish around 7:30pm. Around 5pm, food is being served and I was told I cannot stop to eat because I need to be photographer; in fact, they didn't save me a spot at any table. I'm getting tired and at this point kinda regretting doing this for next to nothing. It's also unbelievably hot: the venue is in an old veteran's legion and it's like 110F and there's no AC. I told the groom I need to take off for 20min to get something to eat and drink. There's no open bar or anything, I can't even get water and my two water bottles are long empty. He tells me I need to either be photographer, or leave without pay. With the heat, being hungry, being generally annoyed at the circumstances, I asked if he was sure, and he said yes, so I deleted all the photos I took in front of him and took off saying I'm not his photographer anymore. If I was to be paid $250, honestly at that point I would have paid $250 just for a glass of cold water and somewhere to sit for 5min. Was I the asshole? They went right on their honeymoon and they've all been off of social media, but a lot of people have been posting on their wall asking about photos with zero responses.",

I've always been the type to have a side hustle I put a lot of my free time into; I get really bored sitting idle. My freelance hourly rates are $60 an hour, and at my full time job, my hourly pay works out to about $40 an hour. So that's how I value my time.  Anyway, over Christmas vacation, I was staying at my parents house. My cousin was also staying over with her three young kids from Christmas to new year's. I'd been planning on doing some work on my freelance projects when I had free time; in the mornings when my family had no plans. I wasn't in any rush; I was already ahead of schedule on them all, but I didn't really have anything else to do. It was in a really rural area and it's like an hour drive to the nearest anything Then my cousin and her husband asked if I could babysit all day for three days, so they could visit some friends in the area and hang out with just adults. I said I had planned on doing freelance work at the library, and she offered to pay me to babysit. I said I could if they got close to my freelance rates. She wanted a number, and although my freelance rates are $60 I didn't feel like that was right, it was high. But I didn't want to go too low; honestly babysitting 3 kids would be harder for me than the routine coding work I had for my freelance project. I don't know a lot about kids and I've never babysat for long, and I had a feeling it would be stressful and difficult. So I said $35, which is below what I make hourly at work, and what is the bare minimum I'd value my time for, if that time is spent doing difficult work.  And she went crazy at me, saying that's a ridiculous rate for babysitting, that I was entitled and being selfish, that I'm trying to take advantage of how she didn't have other options, etc. I said that's way below what I'd be making if I had the time to do my own work, and I'd be putting off my own work to babysit.  Her husband then got mad at me saying that I was a 24 year old girl, that I'm damn near a child myself, that my time is not worth that much and it's childish to say that it was. And that I was a stupid girl for not knowing that babysitting costs like 15 an hour, when I grew up and have kids of my own I will see how stupid I was being. I was kind of done with being called stupid so I just told them I hoped they could find someone else. My mom thinks that I asked for something offensive, and my cousin and her husband obviously did too. AITA for giving that number?",

After wanting to die for the next 48 hours she agreed I did the right thing and that it was funny Backstory: due to my dad's job we lived in Italy for 3 years when I was younger, so I speak Italian almost fluently (it's been awhile, so I've lost some of it)  Recently I started dating a girl. She's great and I love her so much. I met her family a few nights ago for dinner. She warned me that the male side of her family is very big into being macho, into testing the boys the women date and are VERY big on taking pride in their Italian ancestry. I think besides the grandfather, however, they were almost all born in Bergen County, NJ but whatever, its nice to take pride in ones heritage.  Long story short at dinner they kept making jokes at my expense (I honestly would not call it bullying, just things about my height, beard, shaved head). They tried making fun of my IT job too but stopped once I told them my income. It was overall not a bad experience, but a not so pleasant one. Anyways, her older brother kept pushing things, giving me exceptional amounts of shit for playing Lacrosse in HS (apparently its a sport for prissy rich kids and not manly like football or baseball). He ended his rant by saying hey, we're just a big Italian family, we're loud and tell it how we see it! Hahaha! and all the family except my girlfriend laughed. So I, for the next minute, responded to everything they said in Italian. My girlfriend buried her head in shame, the grandfather laughed and everyone else kept looking at each other confused before telling me they didn't speak Italian. I replied then don't use your Italian heritage as an excuse to behave poorly when you can't even speak the language. They got mad, but the grandfather told them all I was right and to be quiet.  My girlfriend isn't mad, just ashamed, I think the grandfather likes me, but word from my gf's sister is that all the men are furious, think I'm a smart ass and that I disrespected them and their masculinity in an unforgiveable way.

I was preparing on Thursday evening  for the kids to arrive when my dil rang me holding back tears saying they\u2019d won\u2019t be going because my sons friend came to town and he said he wanted to spend the weekend with his friends catching up.

I convinced her to drop me off the kids and bring a friend to the spa I even dipped into my savings to give her \u20ac500 to buy herself something nice. When she dropped me off the kids I begged her to tell me were son was after 5 minutes she told me the bar.

I\u2019m ashamed to have stooped to this, but I just wanted to show her how I felt for once, so I said, \u201cI\u2019d be less concerned with what I\u2019m eating if I were you, and more worried about your diet, since you\u2019re the one who needs to figure out how to brush her teeth in a trailer with no running water. Stop trying to get sent to a hospital when you can\u2019t afford healthcare.\u201d  Other students nearby told me I went too far because \u201cit wasn\u2019t her fault she was poor\u201d LIKE IT WAS MY FAULT I WAS ASIAN?!?! She literally fucking cried, like I didn\u2019t cry everytime she called me a fucking chink. She\u2019s left me alone ever since though, which doesn\u2019t matter since I plan on transferring anyways.",

        "selftext": "My (27F) older brother and SIL (both mid 30's) just welcomed their first child a year and a half ago, after YEARS of trying. After many failed attempts, SIL was told that she wouldn't be able to conceive due to a medical condition she has, they finally got pregnant.  Since having my niece, the baby has been the center of attention at EVERY family even we've had since she was born. Birthday's, wedding's, family get togethers, you name it. Now don't get me wrong I LOVE my niece, but it can get to be a little too much when my SIL goes on and on about how long they tried to conceive, complications they've had, miscarriages they've had etc. Like a little TOO much info. Many family members have commented on how it's a little bit excessive, but no one has said anything because they don't want to sound like an AH.  Anyway I'm getting married in the spring and my brother and SIL approached me last weekend about having my niece be the flower girl. Now my fianc\u00e9 (35M) has two children (10M and 6F) from his previous marriage. His son is one of his groomsmen while his daughter had asked to be our flower girl when we told them the news that we were getting married a year ago, as it's something she always wanted to do, so of course we said yes.  So I explained this to my SIL when she asked me about my niece. She asked if my step daughter can just carry my niece with her? I said I don't think she'd be comfortable with that considering she's 6. She then asked why I can't give that role to my niece, and allow herself to carry my niece down as the flower girl? I said no because I already promised my step  daughter. She then starting going off about how my lack of effort to incorporate my niece is disgusting to her. I should honor her in some way since I know how long and hard they tried for my niece.  Now I may sound like an AH for this but I kind of got fed up and snapped and said  Incorporate my niece how? By the time the wedding comes around she'll be 2 years old. The ENTIRE family already knows your story about how long and hard you guys tried for her. What more do you expect me to do to honor her? She started crying and said that clearly I don't love my one and only niece and I'm letting her down. I said of course I love my niece, and obviously she's going to be involved in pictures and stuff. But I'm not going to let my step daughter down by giving my niece a role she's too young to remember anyway.  Well now SIL and my brother are pissed off with me for not letting my niece be flower girl, and are running around telling the rest of the family I don't love my niece. My mom had been trying to stay neutral but thinks my step daughter would understand if I explained to her I need to give that role to my niece. I'm firm in my decision though, and my fianc\u00e9 is thankful that I didn't let his daughter down. AITA for not allowing my niece to be the flower girl?",

        "selftext": "So my friend 20f and I 19m have been friends for a few years and she recently got engaged. A week ago I got a dm from her for a small costume party she was hosting as a celebration for her getting engaged. I asked if there was a theme and she said there wasn\u2019t. I\u2019m a cosplayer so I had a lot of choices. I didn\u2019t want to rock up in an anime cosplay, so I thought it would be funny to go to an engagement party as the Corpse Bride. I arrived at her house yesterday and everything seemed normal. A few people complemented my costume and I was having a lot of fun. After ten minutes my friend\u2019s fianc\u00e9 walked out in a black tuxedo and announced this was actually their wedding. Apparently my friend saw a video of someone doing this and wanted to do the same. He asked us all to go to the back yard for the ceremony to begin. I went straight to him. I asked him if I should quickly go home and change my outfit and that I would get back before it started. He told me it was fine since I didn\u2019t know this was the wedding. I trusted him and followed everyone outside. They got married and everything seemed good. The reception was just in their house again so everyone just walked back inside and picked up where they left off. I tried talking to my friend and celebrating with her but she kept making excuses to not talk to me. I assumed it was just because she was tried from the big day and wanted some alone time. I didn\u2019t bother her after that and the party soon ended. I got home and half an hour passed when my phone started getting notifications. I checked and it was my friend texting me. She was cussing me out and telling me how I ruined her wedding. I was really confused and asked what I did. That only made her more angry. She told me it was basic knowledge not to wear a wedding dress to a wedding. I reminded her I had no idea it was a wedding and that I asked her now husband if I should change and he said it was fine. She didn\u2019t respond, but I got a text from her husband. He asked why I would tell her he said it was fine. I told him he said it was fine. Then he said how I should have changed anyways and it\u2019s my fault that the two are now fighting over this. I\u2019ve tried texting her that I wad sorry and if I had known I wouldn\u2019t have done it. I woke up today and saw her and her husband have blocked me on everything. So, AITA for not changing out of the wedding dress when I found out it was actually a wedding? Edit: I am a guy. I cosplayed the character Emily from The Corpse Bride and had blue paint all over. I\u2019m also Australian and I\u2019ve never heard a costume party meaning fancy.

        "selftext": "This happened just a few hours ago. I am a 19 year old man and the people calling me an asshole are 18 year old men and women.  On Thursday, a person I had a major crush on in high school (but who rejected me) messaged me out of the blue. She had never contacted me without my contacting her first, and at one point I realized she had had me blocked on social media, and so I found it odd that she was suddenly being friendly. After sending a couple of greetings/questions about how I've been, she said that she was going to have some people over and wanted to know if I would get the beer. The drinking age where we are is 19, and she and the people who were going to chill were all 18. The liquor stores in my area all card. I thought it was silly that my being a month older meant I could buy liquor and they couldn't, and so I said I would love to go. She said thanks, I'll pick you up at seven! 7 o'clock rolled around, and she texted me to say she was in front of my house. I went out dressed and ready to chill with some people, and she drove me to the liquor store. When we got there, I asked what beer she wanted me to get, and she told me to get Budweiser. I hid my disappointment as well as I could, but it was her party so I went in and bought two cases of 24.  I got back in the car and said let's party, and she was eerily quiet. I noticed that she wasn't driving towards her neighborhood, but rather back towards mine. I thought she had moved or something, but didn't want to press the issue. When she turned down my street I finally figured it out. She was being purposefully vague about the invitation because she wanted me to get the beer, but she wanted a way out when she told me I wasn't actually invited in the first place. She stopped in front of my house, leaned over, kissed me on the cheek, and said thanks! in her best voice. I deadpanned her and asked when she was going to tell me I wasn't invited. She feigned surprise and said that she never intended to invite me in the first place. I sat in silence for a long awkward minute, picked up the beer, and walked towards my front door. She got out of her car and frantically tried to reinvite me to the party, but I told her that what she did was the most humiliating thing that ever happened to me. I opened my front door, slammed it a bit too hard, and came back to my room. Now I'm sitting here drinking absolutely unpalatable piss water, and I have text messages from all of her friends and her asking me why I'm being such a dick. I don't think I'm the asshole for reacting the way I did, but if you haven't figured it out I'm not amazing socially so I'm not sure. Am I here?",

        "selftext": "This whole saga started because my husband took my last name. A couple weeks ago he got his workplace to change it, and his coworkers found out. About half of them think this is the funniest thing ever and about half are deeply offended. Brenda is in the offended half, and has made that clear.  He and I are in a group chat with his coworkers where we organize carpooling during the pandemic. It is very helpful to us, so we can't leave the chat. Since he changed his name, my husband and I have been dealing with a lot of dumb jokes in the chat, which we have been mostly ignoring.  Yesterday Brenda, his coworker and I got into a bit of a spat. I messaged the group asking if someone could take my husband home since I wouldn't be back from work until late and needed the car. One of his other coworkers agreed, and I thought that was that.  Brenda messages the group saying maybe if you spent less time at work and more time being a wife, your husband wouldn't come into work with dirty shirts I took this as a bad joke initially. My husband is a rural mail carrier, so his shirts look like shirts worn by someone in 90 degree heat on dusty roads. I do wash them, but there's only so much to be done.  Me: I could make cleaning those shirts my full-time job and it wouldn't do much lol Brenda: you won't be married very long if you keep trying to be the man in the relationship. I'd be embarrassed as a wife if I did so little for my husband Me: well I work more hours and pay the bills, so I think he can oxyclean his own shirts if it's so important Brenda: maybe you should learn to take proper care of your husband or you'll find yourself divorced.  Me: I'll let you know when I need relationship advice from someone who is 42 and single Now apparently Brenda is going around and saying that I mocked her for being single in her 40s. I don't care if someone is single in their 40s, but I think it's absolute bullshit that she can call me a bad wife but I can't point out she has no frame of reference.  AITA reddit? Edit: people keep asking why I need to help arrange rides in the first place. When my husband is out on deliveries he rarely has cell service, so if I find out late that I'm going to be home late I need to be able to reach his coworkers directly. Multiple spouses are in the chat for the same reasons. Edit 2: people are saying that I've hurt my husband's feelings by saying I pay the bills. After reading the exchange he sent me a text saying sometimes I forget you're a hard little bitch who takes no prisoners. I'm so proud lol.  He's fine, I asked him just now if my comment about the bills hurt him and he said oh yeah, it's so hard having a hot wife who makes good money. Really tough, pray for me.",

        "selftext": "I (40m) have a sister (30f) who is getting married in a week. The groom proposed to her a year ago at a family dinner that left everyone speechless, but very happy for them as they are longtime companions. During this dinner, my sister asked my son (17m) to make her wedding dress. My son has always loved design and fashion, he took technical courses in these areas and sewing, and even his friends keep asking for his clothes because they are so beautiful. He agreed, but said that he needed time and that he would need her opinion constantly.  At first my sister was very annoying. My son drew about 50 dress designs in a month and she only liked one, which he continued with. He sewed it with great quality fabric which I paid for as I wanted to get involved in a certain way. For five months he made several adjustments to suit her wishes, as she always complained about something. After a while, he arrived at the final model and it was just amazing. My mother cried seeing my sister in the dress and I confess that I almost got emotional too.  The problem was that last week my son came to talk to me about the wedding invitation that had not arrived for him, but for other family members. I thought maybe he didn't need one, but it still felt weird. I messaged my sister raising this issue and she replied that she didn't want any underage people at her wedding because there would be alcohol. I asked if she was going to make an exception for my son, but she cut me off and said no.  There are no children in our family, my son is the only minor, so I didn't see any sense in this rule for family members. And to make matters worse, my son was very sad and cried because he spent months on this dress and couldn't go to the wedding. I was very upset and told my sister that she should look for another dress as soon as possible, as she would no longer wear the one my son made.  She called and yelled at me, saying I was being unreasonable and that I couldn't do this. My mother called me saying I should deliver the dress and follow the rules, but I didn't and hung up on her. Because of this, the family is divided. Many agree with me and condemn my sister's action saying she could only make an exception, but another part says I'm unreasonable and I'm spoiling her big day.  I don't think I'm being wrong but just rational and paying her back in kind. So AITA? UPDATE:  first I would like to thank all the comments and suggestions, I really didn't expect my post to resonate so much.  I talked to my son about the suggestions you guys gave me and he agreed to sell the dress at market price. He calculated the price of everything and the value was quite high. We sent the proposal to my sister and she hated it. She said she couldn't afford it because it was too expensive and it should be a gift because she is family. I responded by saying that it was too easy to say she was family to get a free dress, but not enough to include my son. She cried on the call and begged me not to ruin her day, but I didn't call because that to me was bullshit.  At no point did she offer to just let my son go or apologize for it.  And for anyone who said that maybe she's homophobic, I'm not sure, but I think who could be influencing her is her fianc\u00e9 who is a Christian and has never been close to my son. However, I don't care if he's doing it or not. If she wants to exclude my son from this event then she will also be cutting ties with me.  And for those who are asking for a photo of the dress, I'm sorry to disappoint you, but my son didn't agree and unfortunately I won't post it because of that.  If anything else happens I'll let you know, until then, thank you all!",

Thankfully the offers of charity have stopped (here's hoping they were redirected to their communities) but a good deal of them asking whether or not I stopped being a grinch and started being a good husband and father again.  So, to get those people placated first, here you go:  I DECORATED.  Pics without our faces only, sorry.   [https://imgur.com/H4b2Cak](https://imgur.com/H4b2Cak) [https://imgur.com/QySEGOS](https://imgur.com/QySEGOS) [https://imgur.com/w074cpg](https://imgur.com/w074cpg)  I also spoke with a financial advisor, who is helping me set up a budget for 2020, and a counselor who helped me realize that I was worth more than the goods I could offer someone.  She recommended 2 separate therapists to me, and neither are taking new patients before the new year, so for now, my wife and I are working on our budget and cleaning out various corners of the house for things to sell.  So far, we've gotten rid of some unused basement furniture, a mini fridge that has been empty for 2 years, a bunch of wine racks and paraphernalia (we don't drink at home since the baby was born 2 years ago, so no need to keep it around) as well as some other things and made about $750, more than enough to pay all the overdue bills, put some money in savings, and groceries in the cupboard.  It's going to be a long road to pay off this cc debt, but we're finally addressing the issue head on and moving in the right direction. Since my last paycheck (that covered mortgage and utilities, no worries there, for those who asked if I was behind, thank you) I have also been offered (and taken) 3 DJ gigs for Holiday parties.  2 for personal friends/acquaintances businesses, 1 for a charity.  I refused payment for the children's charity gig, instead offering to give the money right back to the kids instead, which was gratefully accepted by the organizer.  The extra cash from the 2 paying gigs paid down some more debt, and was enough leftover to allow me to have bought some nice new books and a Moana doll for my little girl to open on Xmas morning, (to say nothing of the bags of presents from both sets of grandparents full of clothes and toys, so she'll be fine from a presents standpoint). Inspired by everyone's offers of charity, I volunteered again at Paul's Place in Baltimore, where this time I donned the hairnet and apron and served hot meals.  Cell phones are prohibited inside, plus taking photos of yourself doing charity work defeats the purpose of said work.  I also organized a food drive at my office to provide meal kits for Christmas for needy families, and we were able to donate 574 lbs of food to the MD Food Bank! Thank you to all who reached out and made me realize that I really was an asshole.  I let my personal shortcomings almost ruin a holiday for my wife and child.  It won't be as fancy as our last Christmases, but I have a feeling that this year will be very special to me, no matter how little is under my tree.  I realized that I have all the gifts I need, and I cannot thank the beautiful people who offered up so much charity to a grumpy stranger.  I didn't need to accept your gifts to accept your love, and the offers alone changed my life.  Happy Holiday's y'all.",

        "selftext": "I'm 19f, I have a 3 week old baby girl. I do still live with my parents, but since I pay rent equally, they say I can have just as much of a say in who comes and goes from the house as they do. I've never actually taken advantage of this rule until recently enough. I have a brother, who's 26 and his wife is 24. They're crunchy parents to a 8 month old. Basically what that is is fucking stupid, they use reusable wipes/nappies, think formula is the epitome of evil, babywearing, the list just goes on. I'm the complete opposite, pacifiers, supplementing with formula due to low supply, disposable wipes and nappies. They are completely against the products I use and often give me things like SiLs breastmilk in bags, disposable nappies their LO has grown out of, etc. I've used some but it's not really my cup of tea. On Monday night, my bother and SiL were minding my baby for me since it was my birthday and my babys father (not together, very close friends and co parents) took me to get some dinner in one of my favourite fast food places. It was great and really relaxing.  When I got home that evening, my SiL said that she did some cleaning and threw out anything I don't need. This immediately gave me red flags but they were in a hurry to get out the door and left almost immediately. When I went into the nursery, every disposable nappy and wipe pack was gone and replaced with some reusable cloth ones. Same with my formula, there was 8 tubs and all of it was gone, I'm not able to replace them at the moment and soley breastfeeding isn't sustainable for us. I was extremely angry and I just turned my phone off to avoid being mean to my SiL. She and my brother came over yesterday to collect something they forgot and that was when I confronted her. I told her she has to replace everything she dumped. When she said she can't afford to, I said fine, just get out and don't come back until I've been reimbursed or everything is replaced with the original items. My brother thinks I'm being a massive asshole and he's on his wifes side. Our parents think im being completely reasonable here but they think telling her essentially not to come back is taking it too far. AITA?",

        "selftext": "My son Aiden (23) moved back in with us upon graduating college as my husband wanted. My husband's original plan was to have Aiden live with us for free, but stay home and help with his disabled younger brother (16). Aident started complaining about needing money and wanted to find a job. My husband was against this and even offered to double his allowance but Aiden was growing tired of staying at home. So he began looking for jobs here and there for over a year but non of his job applications came through. He'd just apply and they never get back to him. We were confused by this til recently, I found out that my husband was behind all the job applications being cancelled. He'd wait tol Aiden applies then he proceeds to cancel the application by impersonating him and using his email. I blew up at him for this but his justification is that he's just trying to make sure that our younger son is cared for by Aiden and said that Aiden has been big help and him getting a job will affect his care for his brother. I went ahead and rented an apartment for Aiden and told him to stay there til he finds a job and starts paying for it himself. Aiden was hurt upon knowing what his dad did. My husband was livid when he found out. He called me unhinged and said that I was separating the boys and teaching Aiden to become selfish and care more about a job than family. He also said it was huge decision for me to rent an apartment without even running it with him. He's been giving me hell about it and is calling me a terrible mother for encouraging Aiden to be selfish and selfcentered. He said I needed to see and understand why he did what he did. [Edit] few things to mention: (1) My husband says that since he and I have health issues then we could use Aiden's help. (2) When I suggested outside help, my husband refused saying he won't ask anything from anybody and that his son is his problem and no body else's. (3) I used money from our joint account to pay for the rental apartment. My husband said it was wrong and that it was a major waste of money since we deal with medical bills consistenly.",

        "selftext": "I fucking hate wedding culture. It's bullshit. My fiance and I thought we would escape the bullshit and money by having a small thing. Well, family started trying to throw money at us to make it bigger and more spectacular. We were surprised, but it was a good surprise. Then the demands started coming out. They wanted this, they wanted that, they wanted this person to come, these colors, dresses can't do this, this person has to be flower girl, this person HAS to be a groomsman, etc etc. Suddenly it didn't feel like our wedding, but an excuse for our families to have a family reunion. We put our foot down and said: >Thank you all for your kindness and generosity when it comes to our wedding. Unfortunately, it looks like we may not have been on the same page as the rest of you. When we were offered money for this wedding, we did not realize it came with strings attached. With so many requests and so many demands from people we didn't expect would think they had a say in *our* wedding, we have decided to give everyone their money back.   >  >Our understanding of what a gift is must be very different.  >  >If you would like to give us money without strings attached or requests or demands, we will gracefully accept it. But if you believe a gift should come with stipulations, we must regretfully, and politely decline. This has caused an epic shitstorm. Such to the point where I have people saying they will never come to our wedding (honestly, not the worse thing in the world), that we are spoiled, we're assholes, etc etc etc. My parents are rather upset about it, but hers (who never made any demands and gave us a small cash gift) said we did the right thing.  We are halfway to canceling the whole party and just absconding into the wilderness to do the wedding the way we want.  AITA? (Are We?)",

        "selftext": " My F35 sister F27 started dating one of those brutally honest guys few months ago. He can be quite rude and make backhanded comments about me and the family sometimes which is bothersome but my sister says he's not malicious but is just the brutally honest time and we should get used to it. I visited my parents house to celebrate my sister's birthday and my husband couldn't come with me because he was busy, after the party we all sat down for dinner and my sister's boyfriend said it was weird that my husband and I don't have kids despite being married for 6 years now, I was shocked that he brought this up but I gave a short answer stating that it's because of infertility issues, he asked on which side and I didn't wanna answer but my sister said it's on my side. I got uncomfortable as he looked at me for a second and said that maybe not having kids now is a good thing because he thought women over 30 might produce defective babies due to age. I told him it was none of his business but he said that he was just giving his honest opinion and that's all. I, in return, told him while maintaining eye contact: trust me, if I wanted an asshole's opinion, I would've farted!. Literally everyone at the table bursted into laughter and my sister and her boyfriend were stunned. Few seconds later her boyfriend excused himself out and my sister followed then sent me a text after they left saying I was mean and disrespectful towards her boyfriend and insulted him maliciously just cause he stated his honest opinion, she also said I ruined her birthday by being petty and making her boyfriend the joke of the night infront of the family. I didn't respond but she demanded an apology via mail as soon as possible, mom agreed that I shouldn't have said what I said and should've just ignored him knowing how he is. I think AITA but I'm not sure.",

        "selftext": "I\u2019m 15 years old. I have a stepsister who is a couple years older than me and she is really seriously disabled. I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s wrong with her because no one ever wants to discuss it with me but she\u2019s non verbal, breaks her bones a lot, and has severe epilepsy and will have many fitting episodes. She also doesn\u2019t understand stuff. That\u2019s probably the easiest way to put it. She\u2019s just a human body with nothing inside.  She\u2019s my stepmoms daughter. My stepmom married my dad 3 years ago and they dated only for a year before that. I don\u2019t know my stepmom very well and I don\u2019t really get on with her. We are respectful to each other but I\u2019m basically living with strangers because she\u2019s so busy with her daughter and my dad. I am always on my own and I used to hate it but I\u2019m used to it now. Ever since they moved in to live with us life changed drastically for me because all the care now revolves around my stepsister. That\u2019s fine, I get it, but both my stepmom and my dad ask me to do things for my stepsister that I don\u2019t want to do and I resent doing. Stuff like staying home when I want to go to the mall with my friends, they\u2019re disappointed that I don\u2019t get her anything for her birthday with my very limited funds, etc.  My own mom passed away when I was small so I can\u2019t go and stay anywhere else and all in all I\u2019m just a lot more angry than I used to be because they seem really disappointed whenever I say I don\u2019t want to do anything for her. Even stuff like feeding her- like- I don\u2019t want to sit there feeding her banana pudding and wiping her drool. I didn\u2019t ask for this.  Anyway, she recently fell a few days ago and had a seizure for 8 minutes. She was taken to hospital and the doctors want to keep her in and look after her. I don\u2019t want to go and visit her. I remember seeing my mom in hospital before she died and I just hate hospitals and I sort of hate my stepsister and I just don\u2019t want to go and visit someone who doesn\u2019t even know I\u2019m there.  My stepmom is really upset with me and so is my dad. They haven\u2019t yelled at me or anything but they are both being super cold towards me because I don\u2019t want to visit. My grandma who lives in Canada called me up out the blue and told me it was okay and I don\u2019t need to force myself to go to the hospital so I\u2019m assuming my dad has told her I\u2019m refusing to go. He keeps pleading with me but I keep telling him I\u2019m not doing it. I told him hospitals remind me of mom and he got even more upset and said my stepsister might die and I need to stop being so selfish towards my stepmom.  I just want to know what Reddit thinks because half my friends think I should go and the other half think I\u2019m justified in saying no.",

        "selftext": "So here is the situation. Me: nurse. Working 50ish hours a week in paediatric ICU. Cry at least once a week because that shit is hard. My salary pays our bills. All of them.  Husband: 25M. Has a degree but isn't looking for a job. Works 2 days a week at the grocery store. Spends most of his time playing LoL.  Btw all events here are in accordance with Covid Legislation.  Today was supposed to be A Good Day. I had been begging my husband to swap his Saturday shift to literally anything else so that we could have days off together. We haven't had a weekend together since our wedding, 18mo ago.  Today was supposed to be our first Saturday off together. We were going to go to an animal sanctuary. He starts the day by going to breakfast. With his best mate. Leaving before I even wake up. I wake up around 9 and realise he is not home. Call. He says he's helping his mate set up some lights and that the weather is too rainy for the animal sanctuary anyway.  He gets home at 1ish. Lies around. Plays some video games, promising we would cook dinner together tonight. Leaves again at 5 to help the same mate with something else.  I go grocery shopping. I don't drive because of medical issues, but I walk there and back in the rain. I get home, realise I've left my keys inside. Call husband, knowing he's 5min away. He says he will leave in a minute. I sit in the rain and the cold (southern hemisphere). 45 min later, I call again. He hasn't left yet. He finally agrees to come and let me in the house, so he drives up, presses the clicker to let me in the garage and leaves again.  At 10, I I called to see where he is. His friend answers. Says he is driving out to do something an hour away.  It's 10.30. I am going to bed. I have sent him a txt that I am upset and don't want to speak to him tonight and would rather he left me alone.  As far as I am concerned, if he can't value me more than his best mate on the first day off he and I have shared in a year and a half, he can go sleep in his bed instead. (Btw, his friend doesn't work, so they hang out all the time when I am at work).  He is going to be upset. And he is gonna tell his mate and his mate is going to tell him I'm being a bitch.  AITA Adding some info: I am 26. We weren't always like this. I don't know what changed. I'm fairly confident he's not having an affair. And I fully intend on talking this through, but at a time that isn't 4am.  Also the crying: sick babies sometimes make me sad, and I love all my patients. That's why I cry. And I don't mean hours of sobbing. I mean stepping into a supply closet to take a moment before getting back to work.  Also thank you for your kindness. I was expecting maybe 5 replies. I am trying to respond as much as I can. But there are a lot of you.",

I usually wake her up for pretty much everything because she sleeps through her phone alarm no matter how long it buzzes or how many she sets.  She has joked that I\u2019m her butler before and within the context of a relationship it\u2019s ok so I didn\u2019t mind, obviously I want to love my partner and try make her life easy.  However last night she was chatting with her friends and she thought I couldn\u2019t hear. She was bragging that I\u2019m her little bitch and I do everything for her when she tells me to, etc. It really hurt my feelings because they were making comments like \u2018good, put him in his place\u2019 and she was agreeing.  She specifically said \u2018yeah I\u2019m not worried about tomorrow because the bitch will make sure I\u2019m up and he\u2019ll probably have breakfast ready for me too\u2019  I went to bed pretty hurt by it, and come morning I didn\u2019t bother to wake her up when her alarm started to go. She usually only gets up when someone physically shakes her, but I let her turn off her alarm and she slipped back into sleep and I turned around and went back to sleep too.  When she woke up she was yelling at me saying I\u2019m an asshole and I\u2019ve cost her her exam and I\u2019m a piece of shit for what I did. EDIT: sorry for not responding sooner I wrote this up on my break at work and now I have to get back to it (can\u2019t have my phone, work with food) I wasn\u2019t expecting this many replies so fast.  I think we\u2019re breaking up. I told her this morning after she called me a \u2018bitch\u2019 for being upset re being called a bitch, lol, but she says she\u2019s not done with me.  I\u2019m just trying to get through today\u2019s shift and then deal with stuff later. I\u2019ll try and get back as I can. We\u2019ve been together a year and it was my first real relationship but I\u2019m tired of her not acknowledging how shitty she made me feel and still calling me a bitch. That word is really making me feel shit and small.",

        "selftext": "Quick backstory, after graduating high school my son moved 3 states away for college. At 19 he married a girl he met, I tried convincing him to wait because I personally felt he was too immature. They both dropped out and moved back here to his home town. At 20 they had their first child, a beautiful little girl. 16 months later, my DIL gave birth to their second child, a little boy.  After the first baby, my wife and I noticed our DIL wasn\u2019t happy. We both thought it was PPD related. Just after the second arrived, my son and his wife separated. She would bring the kids over for a visit, it was then she began unloading on us. I know there\u2019s two sides to every story, but considering I know my son, I believed her. I sat my son down numerous times to speak with him regarding his marriage. He refused to take responsibility, blamed her for everything even when I directly pointed out where he was the sole problem.  They got into counseling, for a year things were \u2018ok\u2019 on the surface. Our DIL filed for divorce, my son 3 days later was on Facebook announcing his new girlfriend. A month later, they were engaged. My son had forced his then wife to become a permanent SAHM at the birth of their first child. She of course had no other family or friends here, she knew no one aside from us. She had nowhere to go with two small children. Unbeknownst to our son, my wife and I helped her financially and got her an apartment.  Before the divorce was even finalized, we received a wedding invitation. I made it clear to my son, I would not be attending and they would not have my blessing. His mother told him she would see to it that I would attend. I stayed consistent in my decision, I also asked him not to bring his fianc\u00e9e around our house out of respect for the mother of his children.  The wedding happened on Feb 11. The night before, my wife gave me the finial push. I did not attend. Our daughter, also did not attend for the same reasons. My wife picked up our grandkids, got them dressed and attended the wedding. My daughter and I decided to spend the evening with his ex. I couldn\u2019t imagine her sitting alone, while her kid\u2019s attended their father\u2019s wedding.  She was taken aback that I didn\u2019t end up attending his wedding. We took her out to distract her mind. I just wanted her to know, she\u2019ll always be considered family to us. My daughter also made a joke they can drop the in-law status and just be sisters now. She was very tearfully grateful, I realized just how badly she needed our support and specifically on that night.  The next morning, my son called to tell me how much of a horrible father I am for not attending his wedding. Few days later he caught wind that I spent the wedding evening with his ex. He said that was the ultimate form of betrayal, and further myself and his sister would have to earn an relationship with him on his terms only. *****ETA: First, I\u2019d like to sincerely thank each and everyone of you for your support, encouragement, and all the awards. I know without a doubt, I did the right thing. I even feel differently now, his mother should not have attended either. But we can\u2019t go back and undo that.  So, my son saw the post. I had sent my daughter the link yesterday so she could read the comments. This morning she texts me at work\u2026DAD YOU WENT VIRAL! Lol But anyways, he sent screenshots of the post and all my comments to his mom. He also told her\u2026\u201dHe\u2019s dead to me now.\u201d Time will tell if he means that. I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll see this update too. For that reason, I\u2019m positively certain the second he needs another cash loan I won\u2019t be dead anymore.  His mom told him, \u201cYour children have to be our number one priority.\u201d They\u2019re not just some disposable items you can leave behind when one chapter of your life closes. Maybe one day, he\u2019ll understand this.",

        "selftext": "Throwaway account. So me (26f) and my husband (28m), who I'll call Jake for this story, have been together for 5 years and married for 3. We have recently started trying for a baby as we both felt like that was the next step in our life together, and 3 weeks ago I got a positive test back.  We were really really happy and told our families, and now my mom and MIL want to throw a big baby shower for us, it was just super good news all around.  Well 2 nights ago me and Jake were getting ready for bed when he reminds me to go through the house and make sure all the lights are off. Now he can be a little lazy at times, and it has become a nightly routine for me to make sure all the lights are off that he leaves on before we go to bed. I wasn't feeling very well and asked if he could just do it since he wasn't doing anything and was literally standing by the door. He then tells me No, this is what is expected of you every night. I was a little hurt but I didn't want to fight with him so I just did it. When I came back Jake goes on this very long and unprovoked rant saying things like Just because you are pregnant does not mean anything will change and You are still expected to cook, clean, and do all the chores every day because how can you be expected to be a mother if you can't handle a little work. He wasn't yelling or anything, he was talking to me quietly like a was 2 inches tall.  I was shocked because I had never heard him say anything like this. The rant went on for about 30 minutes before I interjected and asked Well what do you plan on doing to help me with all of this. He then got extremely defensive saying he works his ass of at his job to provide for me and what is going to be our future children. (For context I don't work atm, my job was not paying enough to justify me going so I am a full time college student) He ended by saying that it doesn't matter how I feel physically or mentally, it is a mothers job to push through, and if he helped and babied me I wouldn't be a good mother. I got extremely upset and started yelling and I said that I wish I would've known this is how you felt before I got pregnant with your baby. There was a moment of silence before he started crying and he left for the night to stay at his mothers house. He hasn't been back yet and my MIL and SIL have called me berating me and saying I broke Jakes heart with what I said and I need to apologize immediately, and until I do he isn't coming home. I don't know how to feel.  So AITA for yelling at my husband after he said he isn't helping me with anything during the pregnancy because its a mothers job to deal with it? EDIT: First I want to thank you all for your responses. I'm sorry I haven't really responded to anyone specifically but I really do appreciate you guys. A few of you asked if I told my MIL and SIL what he said, which I did. They basically said I was being sensitive and all he meant was pregnancy isn't an excuse to be lazy, he meant no harm. ......ok. I am getting some things together and am going to be headed to my mom and dads house. My mom is furious with him and doesn't want me apologizing to him or talking to him without the situation either being recorded or having a witness. Regardless, I am ok and will be ok. I do appreciate all of you though, you have opened my eyes to many things I may have been ignoring or looking past over the years.",

He works at a more stable job doing programming at a large company.  He brought me to meet his friends at a party and they asked me about myself. His friends mostly work in tech too and talked about themselves in terms of their jobs. I told them I'm an hiker, I do archery, I love road trips and camping and riding dirtbikes, etc. Basically talking about my hobbies because work is just a way to get paid to do the shit I love. It's not how I define myself and it doesn't come to mind when someone wants me to tell them about myself.  One of his friends asked about work and I said Oh gosh, I don't wanna talk about work at a party! Spent my whole day sweating my ass off in 95 degree heat trying to replace this busted ass motor just to find the replacement part was also fucked. I wasn't lying or trying to downplay that I have a good job, that really is how I spent my day, and I wasn't in the mood to talk shop at a party!   Some other conversations came up casually that probably also made me seem poorer like me saying that car dealership repairs were a ripoff, and telling my boyfriend that my childhood neighbors trailer caught on fire and I was gonna visit and help her out I wasn't doing it on purpose, I was literally just talking about my life, but I guess I gave the impression I was poorer It got later in the night, everyone was getting drunker, and some of his friends (not close ones tho) were making jokes about me growing up in a trailer and being a gold digger. And being ready to jump to a richer guy. Really misogynistic shit honestly, since they don't even know me and seemed to just assume all girls are good diggers. He didn't say anything. He later said it was because he'd smoked weed and gets quiet and has trouble carrying on a quick conversation when he's high. But regardless I felt hurt he didn't say anything.  I got irritated with his friends and asked Now why the hell would you say that when I make twice what he does? His friends went quiet for a second and I continued saying There ain't no gold to dig here, not with him or anyone at this party. So do y'all think I'm cheap, or do y'all think I'm stupid?  My boyfriend wanted to leave the party shortly after and he was pretty upset with me for telling everyone I make twice what he does. I said I would have held my tongue if he'd checked his friends himself. But he didn't say anything so I wasn't about to let them talk to me like that. He said it was humiliating and now everyone thinks I'm a bitch, and I flippantly said at least they know I'm a rich bitch  He was angry I embarrassed him when I spoke up, I was angry I had to say anything at all because his friends were talking shit so it should be on him to check them. Stuff is still tense. AITA for explaining why I'm not a gold digger?",

We aren\u2019t too close to her since she lives pretty far away. She was over our house and she started complimenting my son (my son is 19). It starts off innocent but as time goes on it gets more and more crossing the line.  When we were out on my deck she starts telling my son to take his shirt off, 'whats the point of going to the gym if no one will see it.' My son is visibly uncomfortable and tries to shut her down. She repeatedly is asking and is getting more aggressive with it. I interject and I am like Hey Kathy, I think you are a bit too old and ugly for my son.  This got her upset really quickly, and she excuses herself to the bathroom and starts crying. My wife goes to comfort her, and then later she leaves.  At the end of it my wife is super angry with me for saying that, that I should have said hey Cathy looks like you had too much to drink or something else. I told my wife, that Kathy (btw this is not her real name) works a corporate job she has had training on this and that she knows better. And our son was uncomfortable. He is 18+ but he doesn't know how to deal with an adult-adult let alone someone saying that in our house.  I told my wife flat out that if I was to invite a guy friend and he was to ask to see our daughter in a bikini my wife would have called the police. She says its different. I tell her that I was way kinder to Kathy than I would have been had a guy said something like that to our daughter. And I told my wife that Kathy needs to apologize to my son before she can ever come into our house again.  Overall, I think I was fair. If Kathy just said it once and I said that I think I would be the asshole, but the fact she kept repeating it that's why I said it. And I wanted her to get the message that yes I am upset that's why I included the ugly part.",

        "selftext": "This issue is honestly making me frustrated. Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help. I am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19. I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway. But there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend. I was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.It all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted. She had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's, 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway. I was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi. She is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied. Edit: I am honestly really grateful for not only judging me(not in that way) but also giving me love and support. Each comment means the world to me. I am honestly crying reading some of the encouragement. No one besides my family has said these things to me. I know it might seem silly,but it geniunely means the world to me guys. From the bottom of my heart,thank you. Edit 2: Honestly the support is geniunely overwhelming. I promise to not let you down and to continue being a good person. Thank you for the gold.Thank you all so much for the private messages you have sent me too. I honestly have gone through as many as I can and I just feel really fortunate and grateful. I sincerely hope you all have an amazing life ahead. Thank you so so much, this has been one of the highlights of my year. Edit 3: I am sorry for boring you with all these edits. I geniunely can't thank you guys enough. I showed my parent's these posts and they had tears of joy too. I am so thankful to each and every one of you guys, loads of love. BUT, I have been noticing a worrying number of DMs saying me I could have used her body and had some fun after knowing the truth etc. I am not this kind of person and I hope nobody is. I have my own integrity. It's NOT right to just forcefully have sex with her, that's appalling. A couple of other DMs sent me links to secret webcams to expose her nudes etc. It's honestly horrifying. I am not that kind of person and shall never ever be one. I just want to make the world a better place and the people around me happy.  I thank these people for their support, but their way to go around it is very wrong. A lot of women ARE amazing. My mother is amazing, the person who sent the screenshots is amazing, my coworkers are amazing, and I am sure many women out there are amazing.  Please don't tell me to take 'the red pill' or anything of that sort. Because I am not going to do that, ever. Please don't say all women are manipulative etc.  This post isn't anti-women in anyway, it's me talking about the person I believe wronged me.",

If we go out to a restaurant I have to entertain them because my mom needs to talk to my sister and BIL.  You get the picture.  My parents decided that since this was my last summer before I became an adult we would be going to Disneyland to celebrate my graduation.  I asked who was going and they said it was just the three of us.  But when we got to the airport my sister and her family were there. Strangely enough they were also going to Disneyland.  I went into my backpack and grabbed my passport. I put it in my sock.  When we got to the international security I couldn't find it. We looked everywhere.  I had to Uber home and I missed my flight. Oh well. I get to stay home by myself for a week of peace and quiet.  My parents were very mad at me for losing my passport. The money they spent on my flight and entrance was wasted. Darn.  My mom and sister have both been posting about how hard it is to be at Disneyland with two little ones. They both posted that I ruined the vacation by being so thoughtless.  My dad says he knows why I did and he understands. But he says I should have let him know so he didn't waste money. He said he would have gone along with my ruse.  I feel bad about wasting money but I have been to Disneyland before. And I will go again later by myself or with friends.",

        "selftext": "The title sounds bad but hear me out.  Backstory: I (F28) have a friend (F28) who purchased a house late last year. It's an awesome 2 story town house and I've been over there plenty of times to help out with moving/decorating and for hanging out. As mentioned in the title, her parents purchased the house for her and her partner. I truly have no issue with this as the housing market is terrible for buyers so more power to them for being home owners. I recently, unfortunately inherited my parents house, which is 3 bedroom, out in the sticks.  The issue: We went appliance shopping because most of the the stuff in the house was 10-15 years old. We were standing with an employee who I had asked to recommend some smaller items like toasters and kettles when the employee asked if I was moving out as general chit chat. I told him I was moving, and he asked whether I bought or rented. I told him bought, because it was just easier and less awkward than telling him I inherited the house. He told me that was cool and began talking about the toasters again when my friend cut in that I had inherited my house, not purchased it. The employee went quiet and I gave her a what was that face. I was taken aback, she continued on saying Yeah, *I* purchased my house. I asked does it really matter? I'm here to buy some kitchen appliances not tell this guy my personal issues. She grinned and said it's just for the record which made me more confused and annoyed. (You can probably see where this is going) I replied Oh okay then if it's just for the record your parents purchased your house for you. The employee quickly retreated and she walked outside of the shop. I caught up with her and she said I was a massive asshole for pointing out she couldn't afford to own without her parents help. I returned with a very similar my parents also helped me with getting a house too, just in a really terrible way. My partner agrees with me, saying that she's the one that opened that door, but our other friends are split almost 50/50. Edit: Holy hell this blew up. Sorry I wasn't clear with my friends being 50/50, half think I'm NTA and the others think we're both assholes and I shouldn't have escalated the problem.",

We went to get drinks in pairs, Grace going with her boyfriend, meanwhile Nick and I stayed at the table and vice versa. So Nick and I had plenty of time to talk just the two of us.  Nick started the night by telling about his recent career change, he decided to quit his previous job, go to a coding bootcamp and he got a job as a developer one or two months ago. He was very proud of himself and his new salary and told me this multiple times.  He never asked me what I do for work, but talked about his new job quite a lot, occasionally saying sorry, you don't understand that, haha. During the entire evening, I never told him I has been working as a software engineer for the past 4 years, because he never asked and honestly, I found it a bit entertaining.  When it came to the drinks, he invited me to every single one. Don't worry about it, it's not a problem with my devoper salary. I told him multiple times he doesn't have to pay for me, but he insisted.  At the end of the night, when we were saying our goodbyes, he took out his phone to send me a friend request on Facebook. My job is listed in my profile, so that was when he realized that I'm software engineer.  He asked me if it's true that I'm a software engineer and I answered yes. He asked me why I haven't told him, why did I let him believe I was a cashier like Grace used to be (?? I never implied that), and why did I let him pay for everything when I probably earn more than him.  I told him that he never once asked and it was his fault he assumed. He could have simply asked me about my job, but he only wanted to brag about his. But if he wants me to, I can pay him back for the drinks.  He was a angry and said I made a fool out of him. I think he did that, not me. But now Grace and her boyfriend are on his side too, saying that it would've cost me nothing to tell him early in the evening and I only kept it for myself for my own entertainment.  Well, I did find it entertaining, but I don't really feel like I did anything wrong. AITA?",

        "selftext": "So, my MIL (I'm a gal btw lol) came to stay with us for few weeks til her home is renovated for christmas. The problem is that she has been randomly walking in on me while I'm in the bathroom. Thankfully not once has she seen me naked because I started picking up on her behavior after the second time in a week. She'd barge in, then turns and says oh sorry then close the door. I tried talking to my husband about it but he kept ignoring me then flatout said so what if she accidently seen you naked? She's faaaammmillly!!. He seriously said that!. We have a lock and I could've used it but I have past trauma from the idea of locking/being locked in a room after my brother locked me in the bathroom when I was 5. So I came up with this idea. I'd go inside the bathroom pretending to use it and wait for her to come (cause honestly? It's deliberate at the this point). When she accidently barges in she'd see me in a weird/awkward position. For example doing a ballet stand, standing on the toilet, or standing facing the wall with my hands up, (fully clothed of course). I could see how awkward and weird this would be for her because she'd stand there for few seconds trying to figure out what I was doing. It was halirious at first seeing her initial confusion but she told my husband about it claiming she's caught me practicing rituals in the bathroom. I cleared things up and revealed the reason why. My husband was livid. He called me childish and said that I made his mom feel terrified/weirded out by my behavior. He said I should've acted maturely and locked the damn door instead of playing mind games. Edit. Lol. Um what? I just came back on here and saw literally 1000s? of people? OMG now I feel embarrassed Glad I went anonymous Lol. But seriously...I'm looking at my screen and am like ....I'm famous? Seriously though...My husband and his mom are extremely upset with me. He still thinks it was ridiculous and is demanding an apology before she goes back to her home.  I'm not sure if I will apologize because yes while it was a me problem that I couldn't use the lock. It's still feels wrong what she did and maybe I'm wrong too but at least I got (so did you apparently lol) a bit of a chuckle out of it \ud83d\ude05\ud83e\udd23 also, I'm sure Thanksgiving dinner will hella awkward tomorrow.

        "selftext": "My (25F) father married my step-sister's (23F) mother when I was 4 and she was 3. We've lived together most of our lives and are a family. She and I were extremely close. She developed cancer when she was 14 and was sick for about 2 years. She's since made a full recovery. During that time, my parents became understandably over-protective. They also asked a lot of me. I quit my extracurriculars so I could get a job (the money went towards her medical bills) and so I could drive her to appointments. I didn't go to dances and any fun activities I did needed to include her. I did almost all of this willingly, the exception being having to quit my high school volleyball team - I did throw a bit of a tantrum about that, but was swiftly punished. And I think having one emotional breakdown was pretty chill given the circumstances. Anyhow, I go to college and meet my ex, we'll call him Ben, when I'm a junior. We fall in love, blah blah blah. He and I move in together when we graduate, so we've been living together for about 3 years. We were serious until July when I walked into my bedroom and saw him fucking my sister. I broke it off, tears were shed, he moved out, etc. My sister apologized at first but then backed off. I thought she was giving me space but last week she called and asked if we could meet up. She told me that she and Ben were in love and were just telling me as a courtesy before they started posting photos online. Distraught,  I left her in the restaurant by herself and did not pay my portion of the bill. She later venmo'ed me asking for the money. She told my parents who then called me to their house, telling me how disappointed in me they are for not supporting my sister's relationship with Ben. They brought up the fact that because she had cancer as a teenager, she never learned proper social etiquette, and has a hard time meeting people. I don't buy this, in part because I've seen her socialize just fine and since we spent a good chunk of the time she was sick together, that would also mean that I should have bad social skills as well, by that logic. They then told me that if I don't accept my sister and Ben's relationship, they may have to go no contact with me. I reminded them that I'm also their daughter and they should understand my point of view, but they are adamant that this is about me being jealous of her. For the record: I'm not jealous of her. I'm not upset that Ben picked her over me. I'm sad about the end of the relationship and do feel betrayed, but lord knows that I don't want to be with a cheater. What I'm upset about is the fact that my sister chose Ben over me. That she slept with Ben knowing he and I were in a long-term, committed relationship, and continues to be with him knowing how much it hurts me. Now no one in my immediate family is talking to me and I'm getting messages from aunts and uncles and cousins telling me that I'm an asshole and a selfish bitch.   Edit: Thank you everyone so much for your comments. This has gotten more attention than I expected and am having trouble keeping up, so if I don't say thank you, then thank you. I've been given a lot of food for thought. TBH, while I've had moments where I've been resentful or upset about my teenage years, I've always thought that I did the right thing for my sister and for my family. And that time wasn't all miserable; I was very close to my sister and we made things as fun as we could. But I didn't think of it as an abdication of my parent's responsibilities or that they were doing wrong by me, which many of you pointed out. I definitely have a lot to think about. Thank you again for making me feel less crazy about all of this!   UPDATE: Sometimes you can only laugh. Just got off of the phone with my cousin who saw this post and said he could explain a few things. I asked him why he was on Reddit instead of school, he asked me why I was on Reddit instead of work, and I said touch\u00e9. He told me that after my conversation with my mom, she went to his house and talked to my aunt. And here's the deal: Turns out my sister is not only in a relationship with Ben but **FOUR MONTHS PREGNANT**. Which means she and Ben were fucking for longer than I had even guessed. Apparently my parents are so adamant that I forgive her because I'm already ruining their experience of their first grandchild. That's right, I'm less important than my stepmom posting ultrasounds to Facebook. This is where we're at. Anyhow, I called out of work sick the rest of the day and am going to drink a lot of alcohol. Like, a lot of alcohol. And then start thinking about what the fuck I'm going to do.",

Peggy has recently been promoted to Manager, after 2 solid years of good work as a cashier. I really thought she could handle the responsibility.   So, I wake up, 3 hours after the place should be open, and I have 22 notifications on the store Facebook page. Customers have been trying to come shop, but the store is closed. Employees are showing up to work, but they're locked out.    I call Peggy, and get no response. I text her, same thing. So I go in and open the store. An hour before her shift was supposed to be **over**, she calls me back.   I ask her if she's ok, and she says she needed to take a mental health day and do some self-care. I'm still pretty pissed at this point, but I'm trying to be understanding, as I know how important mental health can be. So I ask her why she didn't call me as soon as she knew she needed the day off. Her response: I didn't have enough spoons in my drawer for that..   Frankly, IDK what that means. But it seems to me like she's saying she cannot be trusted to handle the responsibility of opening the store in the AM.   So I told her that she had two choices:   1) Go back to her old position, with her old pay.   2) I fire her completely.   She's calling me all sorts of -ist now, and says I'm discriminating against her due to her poor mental health and her gender.  None of this would have been a problem if she simply took 2 minutes to call out. I would have got up and opened the store on time. But this no-call/no-show shit is not the way to run a successful business.  I think I might be the AH here, because I **am** taking away her promotion over something she really had no control over.   But at the same time, she really could have called me.   So, reddit, I leave it to you: Am I the asshole? EDIT: I came back from making a sandwich and had 41 messages. I can't say I'm going to respond to every one of yall individually, but I am reading all of the comments. Anyone who asks a question I haven't already answered will get a response.",

Our dog is quite small, a mini poodle mix and almost 13 years old, she is still active but it is really unlike her to run away from us and I was suspicious but chose to believe my husband and me and my daughter were in grief but did not want to blame him. When we came back home, he seemed surprisingly ok unlike us. Ever since the pandemic, my husband started working from home and he has always been annoyed at how much attention we gave Ellie and hated how Ellie begged to sit on our laps and his while he worked. A few days later we got a call from an animal rescue in a neighboring state quite far from us that she had been found. I picked the phone and it was on our landline which we almost never use these days but was the contact on the microchip. I told my husband and he just said that is great, I am so happy but it felt kind of blunt and insincere. I said it is strange that she got so far and he responded that someone must have stolen her and then abandoned her. This made little sense to me as to why that would happen. When he was out drinking with his buddies, I copied the videos from his dashcam for the days I was away and saw that he had indeed taken Ellie far out of state, and clearly dropped her in front of his car thrown a frisbee like object into a field, yelled fetch and drove off without her. I was livid and confronted him and he just stupidly muttered how he dropped her there so she could find a farm and have a better life and then the next day got really angry at me for viewing his dashcam and called me an my daughter AHs.",

        "selftext": "My [27M] older sister [30F] and her fianc\u00e9 [31M] were planning for over a year for their wedding to be this month. Obviously, they can\u2019t have the wedding as planned, but they still would like to get married, so they decided on a \u201cZoom\u201d wedding where all of the family/friends would just call in to watch the officiant, my sister, and her fianc\u00e9.  My sister didn\u2019t want to be in charge of hosting the Zoom call because she thought it would stress her out, so she asked me to and I gladly accepted.  She and her fianc\u00e9 decided to invite everyone they originally wanted to, and it was a very big list. When we were going over the list, my sister mentioned to me that she wanted everyone else to be muted for the majority of the wedding as she was worried that others would talk over her and her fianc\u00e9 and quote \u201covershadow\u201d them on their big day \u201cthat was already scaled down\u201d. However, her and her fianc\u00e9 said that I should unmute everyone at one point so everyone could talk and have a nice time with each other.  Fast-forward to the day of the wedding\u2014everyone is muted during the ceremony which goes great, and so I then unmute everyone and ask to please raise a hand if they\u2019d like to talk so it doesn\u2019t get confusing. My cousin (around my age) starts waving his hand crazily, and he\u2019s with his longtime girlfriend (also similar age I guess). He\u2019s a very gregarious guy, so I was not surprised. Then, he says stuff like \u201c(my sister) and (her husband) are such an inspiration, it\u2019s given me the courage to do this....\u201d then turns to his girlfriend and pulls out a box that is the size of an engagement ring box?? I immediately saw this as him trying to steal the spotlight (something that he\u2019s done since we were kids, ex: he would secretly mess up my sister and I\u2019s drawings if the adults would praise ours) and booted him off of the call. Then I quickly announced that my cousin had technical difficulties and would not be joining again. Everyone else accepted this and went about talking, and my sister and her husband did too.  The rest of the wedding went smoothly\u2014except for the fact that my cousin kept texting me angrily saying that he finally wanted to propose as a surprise with family all around and I ruined it. My aunt and uncle texted me the same. AITA??",

        "selftext": "This all started back in March. My son's best friend turned thirteen. In his family, thirteenth birthday is a huge deal. In addition to a massive party (which all four of us were invited to) his parents also took him to Disney World. They invited my son to attend as well. My wife was hesitant to consent to this. She said it was unfair to allow our son to go when our nine year old daughter can't. Especially since she loves Disney and princesses. I said that our kids won't always have the exact same opportunities, and if we set a precedent here, we'll have to stick to it if and when our daughter gets a similar opportunity. So we'd just be punishing both our children needlessly. My wife reluctantly agreed that we should allow our son to go. I gave our son money to buy his sister souvenirs. He did, and his friend's parents even bought extra stuff for him to give to her. Still, when she saw him come back wearing a Star Wars shirt with the Mickey hat and trading pin lanyard, she burst into tears. My wife later said we made a huge mistake and never should have let him go. I (mistakenly) thought all of that was behind us. Now, we are not well off financially, but my BiL is, and he invited all of us to visit a beach house he rented for a summer send-off. My wife told me she wants to have our son stay with my dad and just take out daughter to even the score. I told my wife that isn't happening. We are their parents. We can't favor one child over the other. Not being invited to the birthday trip of a kid you barely know is in no way comparable to being left out of a *family vacation* and I'm shocked she would even suggest such a thing. I refuse to allow it. Now my wife is angry, but I don't care. I'm not punishing my son for being lucky. AITA?",

All the time she makes comments about my weight. She doesn't call me by name she calls me slim and I even heard her say one time go ask toothpick and she has said stuff like you need some meat on your bones & you need to eat. I have only worked there 8 days. I have asked her very nicely to stop. Yesterday I asked her to stop calling me slim again and she basically said it's her mouth and she can say what she wants.  Today when she said morning slim I replied morning chunky and she got upset and actually started crying. Everybody here at work, (only 6 of us total) is saying I'm wrong and I should apologize because being called fat is different than being called skinny because being called skinny is a compliment. I said as long as she calls me slim, I will call her chunky and now I'm the bad person. AITA if I don't apologize? The owner/manager has completely ignored the situation saying it's a high school issue and we should figure it out. EDIT FOR MORE INFO: We don't have HR. There's only 6 of us working here (cupcake shop). We are all regular employees. I went to the owner BEFORE I called her chunky and I asked him to talk to her because I felt she was harassing me. That's when he said we can handle it ourselves. That's why I called her chunky. I told her to stop calling me slim and I didn't like it and she continued to do it. She didn't stop doing it after I asked multiple times and I didn't know what to do besides what she was doing to me. She brought up my weight, I brought up her's.",

Recently my in laws were over, and we were all watching a movie together. It was a kids movie, and so my 15yo was bored out of her mind and tired, so she started to snuggle up to me and go to sleep. After the movie was over, we sent all the kids to bed/their rooms and got chatting for a bit longer. There was a fair bit of wine involved (I was sober though), and eventually after a short silence my FIL let it drop that he thought it was inappropriate I still cuddled with my 15yo. I don't really know why he brought it up suddenly, but I was prepared to laugh it off and just assumed it was the alcohol. To my surprise, my wife and MIL both agreed with him. I have a lot of respect for my in-laws, I get along with them great and I consider them closer than my own parents. Obviously I'm quite fond of my wife as well, but I outright told them to fuck off and go fuck themselves and then left them and went to bed. I've never spoken to any of them like that before, but it felt like the right thing to say in the moment. They all want me to apologize for being so rude to them. AITA?  Edit due to info request: We were not spooning, she was sitting next to me laying on my chest. Edit of my own free will: Idk if it's important info, but I didn't yell. Edit: I think I've read most everything now, thanks for all the messages of support and hate, I liked them all. Some people asked me to make an update post, I don't think I will, sorry. I've been speaking to them over the past few days and I know why they said what they said (although it's not relevant to me telling them to fuck off), but it's pretty personal and I don't feel like sharing. I wont be apologizing to any of them, especially now that I know their reasoning. I love my wife, but it hurts that she doesn't trust me.",

        "selftext": "When I (17 M) was 8, my parents bought me a piano and signed me up for lessons. I was super excited because I love music. Over time I kind of became known as the 'piano guy' at school. I play at school concerts, accompany the school jazz choir, and play once a week for the residents at a couple of retirement homes in our town. When I was 15, I started to talk about quitting lessons, and my parents quickly tried to guilt me out of it. I told them I wanted to try other things, and that between piano and studying, I didn't have much time left for other extra curriculars. My Dad proposed a deal. If I kept playing and taking lessons until I reached level 10 RCM (Royal Conservatory of Music), and continued to keep my grades up at school, he would buy me a new car of my choice. I jumped at it and we shook hands on the deal. I should explain that my family is well off financially. I have a very privileged life, but I wouldn't say I've been spoiled. If I ever want a luxury item like a new phone or game console, I have to buy it myself with money I've saved from summer and after school jobs. I should also explain that my Dad's big on loopholes.  When we compete, he always finds a way to win, and when I do it doesn't count because of some loophole. It drives me nuts, but he thinks it's hilarious.  Whenever I complain about him not playing fair, his answer is always the same: life isn't fair. So, because of our deal, I kept up with my lessons. I spent about 1-2 hours a day on piano, while keeping my grades up. Last summer, I took my level 9 RCM exams and passed, fulfilling my part of the deal. II told my Dad I'd chosen the BMW X5 plug-in hybrid SUV. A couple of months ago, on my birthday, I came downstairs for breakfast, and my Dad told me there was a surprise waiting for me in the garage. I ran out, and sitting in the middle of the floor was a 1/24 scale, toy BMW X5. My Dad burst out laughing and said, A deal's a deal, so as promised here is your brand new BMW! My heart absolutely broke. I asked if he was being serious, and he said I couldn't seriously have expected him to buy a 17 year old a real brand new BMW and that we could discuss getting me a reasonably priced used car. I said we had a deal and I fulfilled my end of it, he said he did too since I never said that the car had to be full size and drivable. I said he wasn't being fair. His response: life isn't fair. Ever since this happened, I've been distant with my Dad. I honestly feel like he betrayed my trust and that he deliberately made a fool out of me. He keeps bringing up the idea of a used car, but I told him I'm not interested, which I admit is kind of petty. I have enough money saved that I can buy a cheap used car myself, and I just feel like if I accept one from him now it's like saying that breaking his promise didn't matter and that he didn't do anything wrong.

        "selftext": "**UPDATE POSTED ON MY PAGE** This happened last night but my phone is still blowing up.  I F(26) dipped into my savings and got Mike, my boyfriend (27) a PS5 for his birthday yesterday.  He knew he was getting the PS5 because he told me that the PS5 is the only thing he wants. We\u2019ve been together for 4 years so the cost didn\u2019t matter. That is until, I found out what he thinks about me.  Some background: When I was 18, I was involved with Jake, a guy who I met online. We ended things after 3 months, and I moved on shortly after with Adam, a guy from work.  I found out a couple months later that Jake and Adam were actually really close friends but I didn\u2019t know Jake long enough to meet his friend group, so I had no idea.  After finding out, I took some time off dating and two years later, I met my current boyfriend Mike. I was upfront and honest with Mike about my past and the fact that I was unintentionally involved with friends. He said he understood and my past didn\u2019t bother him. Last night at his party, I showed up with the PS5 and him and his friends were screaming with joy. His best female friend Jessica laughed and said \u201cI wish I was a thot so I could afford a PS5 too.\u201d I looked at her with an \u201cexcuse me?\u201d Look on my face and she just said \u201cnevermind\u201d and walked away.  I confronted my boyfriend about it and he said and I quote \u201cshe\u2019s just messing with you. You can\u2019t take a joke?\u201d So I pushed further as to why this girl is even calling me names to begin with and he said \u201cwell, everyone knows you were a thot before you met me.\u201d  I asked him to explain how I was a thot before him and he said \u201cyou know\u2026messing with best friends?\u201d  He then pat me on the shoulder and said that it\u2019s okay because I\u2019m not who I was back then and if he could get over my \u201ccolourful past\u201d and \u201cthot mentalities\u201d to give me a chance, then I could get over Jessica\u2019s comments and give her another chance. I didn\u2019t say anything. I just got up. Took the PS5 from the gift table and left. He was PISSED. He literally called me like 20 times, but I didn\u2019t care. I was so hurt that I took the bow off and took it straight back to the store I got it from. They happily refunded it. I thought that was done but Mike and all his friends including Jessica are berating me for being petty and they\u2019re all saying I brought this on myself by making poor choices.  I responded to Mike and told him that he deserves better than me so find someone who wasn\u2019t a \u201cthot\u201d and get the PS5 from them because I returned it.  He started screaming how I\u2019m \u201cthe biggest AH\u201d for returning it and how I should be happy he ignored my \u201ccolourful past.\u201d  I\u2019m thinking maybe taking it back went too far.

        "selftext": "I sustained very bad injuries to my face this month. I'm in the stage of healing when the scar tissue has formed, but it's still very tender new skin. I'm going to have very obvious facial scarring for the rest of my life. The injury starts about an inch above my hairline, goes down over my brow so that on part, hair will not grow. It continues down my cheek where it is deepest; I'll always probably have an indentation in the fullest part of my cheek. Then it continues to my jawline.  In some ways it's OK. I'm happy it's just cosmetic damage. My friends are super reassuring, telling me how badass and sick it's gonna look. They say I'm still as hot as ever, now a little more sexy and mysterious lol. But in some ways it really sucks... I know that I'm always gonna be seen first as the girl with the scar and it feels especially bad when people look at me differently. This week, I had to fly home for a family thing; it was a plan I'd made long before my injury. I wasn't really looking forward to the pity or people making a big deal of it; I'd rather it not be acknowledged. I'd also met with my dermatologist who said that I was at the stage of scar tissue formation that I no longer should be dressing the wounds; the skin was healing and instead I needed to be applying topical cream and Vaseline to keep the site clean and moist.  It also looks a bit ugly; the building scar tissue is very red and tender, and with the Vaseline over it, looks slick and shiny. So I get on this flight; I have the window seat and I put on my headphones and drift off to sleep when the plane is still boarding. I wake up to this kid, maybe 4 years old, sat next to me, throwing a tantrum. I didn't catch the first part of it and I honestly couldn't understand what he was yelling about...  His father said to me, Can you cover that injury?  I said that my dermatologist recommends I don't, so no I don't think I will.  He started snapping at me saying there is no need to be so rude. That injury is graphic and it's scaring my little one. I said this is my face. The only damn face I've got. It sucks being told I'm so ugly I can't show my goddamn face in public. He started to backtrack saying just until it's healed and I said it'll always be with me. Maybe teach some fucking compassion and respect instead of telling a girl half your damn age what you think about her face. That's rude.  He actually got up after that and I think went to a stewardess about a seat change because a young couple came to sit next to me on a few minutes instead. I've gotta admit I felt so low that I put on my sunglasses and had a quiet cry for a few minutes. AITA for not covering my healing scar, and for being confrontational about it?",

Yes I did that. Yes he knows. Yes he doesn't care. It was 2 years ago (at that time), we got over it. After that there was a span of 3-4 months in were my MIL and some of my fianc\u00e9s aunts and cousin ''police'' their husband when I was around, it was really weird tbh because this dudes were like 40-60yo and I wasn't that desperate, so my fianc\u00e9 shut their bullshit hard and even when his family still gives me the side eye from time to time, we thought it was behind us. He proposed last year and five months ago we found out that I was pregnant, we were really happy about it and we told his family as soon as we knew. His sisters and young brother were happy for us, but his mom took me aside and *begged* me to be honest with her and asked if this was really my fianc\u00e9s child, I was taken aback but I just rolled my eyes and said yes, she gave me some shitty speech about how ''she only wanted to make sure'' and that ''she was happy to be a grandmother''. Well, last weekend we were at his parents with his family and some of his friendsand we were talking about the name, how he might look (small talk, we will love him regardless but there's always some ''*Oh I hope he gets your nose!*'' ''*mmh I like your eyes, I hope he gets them*'' comments) and my FIL said that he and his children have a birthmark in the inner tight and that even his grandchildren (one of my SIL's kids) got them, so our baby might too, and then he said ''But how can we know from who he got it? it may as well be from me, my boy or my brothers'' and he and his brothers began to laugh. My fianc\u00e9 got mad and before he could say anything I said ''I don't get it'' and my FIL was ''yeah because it runs in the family'' and I said again ''I don't get it, why would he get it from you?'' and he began to get nervous and said ''because you know... it's just a joke OP'' and I said ''but I don't get it and you all laughed, explain'' it got to the point that some of his friends said ''hey, it's not funny'' so he he excused himself and left.  Later my fianc\u00e9's BIL came to me and said that I was wrong for embarrassing him like that in his own house and that I knew what the joke was about and *because of my past*, I shouldn't be surprised. Now they're all demanding that I apologize to my FIL.",

I told her she has a few months to get her shit together and leave. I give her about $100 a week to keep my house clean so she has some cash. I gave my sister her $100 and she said I owed her more. I was confused. She said she did other work for me. I asked her what more did she do? She said she walks my dog in the afternoon. I walk my dog every morning and evening. But she takes him with her on her afternoon walks. She said the going rate for a dogwalker is $25 per walk. 5 X $25 = $125 on top of the $100. Then she mentions she put together a scrapbook of personal letters and papers. According to her and Etsy, that job was easily another $75.  I told her I never gave her permission to do those things. Her argument is that those jobs fell under the umbrella of keeping the house clean and I was ripping her off. So I threw her out.  The money isn't the issue. I have plenty of disposable income. I was disgusted how she came at me.",

        "selftext": "The past couple of months, my wife has been complaining about our cats. She\u2019s been claiming that the cats wake her up constantly and that she\u2019s frustrated every night that she \u201chas to get up and open the door for the cats\u201d or \u201cthe cats keep making noises\u201d or \u201cthe cats keep jumping on her.\u201d It got to the point where she started saying she wants me to get rid of them. I told her I\u2019ve never seen or heard any of this, but she claims I sleep through it all. She kept telling me she was getting less and less sleep and kept acting aggressive, blaming lack of sleep from the cats, and that if I didn\u2019t get rid of them, she\u2019d leave me. I legitimately started considering giving the cats to my sister, until I noticed something. One morning she claimed she had gotten up multiple times throughout the night to help the cats. She listed a bunch of times. I thought it was weird, because I had been up until 4am, and she claimed that she \u201cgot up at 1am to open the door for them, and a few times around 3am because they were meowing and jumping on her.\u201d I was in the bedroom the entire time while she slept, and I know none of that happened. Things weren\u2019t adding up, so I decided to run a test. I waited until she said she was going to bed, then I let the cats out of our bedroom, lowered my phone brightness, and faked going to sleep. I just laid there in bed for the entire night, bored, but I definately did not fall asleep. I made sure to make timestamps every 30 minutes on my phone through Discord just to be sure. I marked down every noise my cats made. One cat had jumped down from something and made a little sound at 3:18am, and one ate food relatively quietly by the bedroom door at 4:57am. Other than that, nothing happened. Sure enough, my wife slept from 11pm until 9am, and that morning she claimed she had woken up \u201cat least 7 times\u201d to open doors and from cat noises and cats jumping on her. At this point I was pissed because she was clearly lying to me. I was exhausted and fed up with the lies, so I just bluntly called her out on it. I told her, \u201cThat\u2019s funny. I stayed up all night to monitor the cats, and they weren\u2019t even in the room at all last night. I have timestamps and everything. So you\u2019ve been ***lying*** to me and trying to convince me to get rid of my cats? Why?\u201d She just sat there quitly shaking and looking pissed, then got up and left without answering. She came back hours later and ignored me whenever I talked, and when I asked her how **I\u2019m** the bad-guy in this situation, **she finally said that I was treating her like a child by lying about sleeping and staying up all night just to see if she was lying or not** and that making timestamps and everything as if I was an investigator was \u201cgoing too far\u201d and makes me an obsessive asshole. I did it because she was threatening to make me get rid of my cats or she\u2019d leave me, and her claims didn\u2019t add up. So, am I an \u201cobsessive asshole?\u201d **UPDATE:** My wife has been Baker Acted. She did not hurt herself, just said something concerning in public. I got a call from the hospital this morning, asking me to head over for some \u201cfamily therapy.\u201d Apparently she finally wanted to talk. I\u2019ll be honest, I\u2019m pretty pissed at the reason why she\u2019s been so hateful towards my cats. It\u2019s absolutely asinine. It\u2019s nothing that anyone had suggested. *She\u2019s not cheating. She\u2019s not sick physically or mentally. She\u2019s not bored of the relationship and looking for an \u201cout.\u201d* According to her, ***one of the cats stepped on her laptop and ruined a story she was writing.*** She\u2019s hated both cats ever since. I mean that sucks, but it\u2019s not worth trying to emotionally blackmail me into getting rid of them. I asked her why she didn\u2019t just tell me the truth and why she\u2019d been lying and refused to talk about it when I\u2019d asked. Her answer was \u201cBecause you wouldn\u2019t have gotten rid of them otherwise.\u201d and explained that when she saw I wasn\u2019t willing to abandon them for her, she took offense and made it a \u201cgoal\u201d to have me pick her over them. Sickening. Don\u2019t know why she actually admitted to it all. The woman with us asked me how I felt about all of it, and I just told the truth. I told her it was a nice run, but I\u2019m ***probably*** going to want a divorce. I was asked why, and I told them. I\u2019ve seen a new hateful, malicious side of her that I want nothing to do with. She was so set on getting rid of the cats over a *fanfiction* being ruined that she manipulated her husband. My wife started shouting at me that I\u2019ve betrayed her and that I\u2019m \u201cscum\u201d for choosing animals over her. At least cats don\u2019t give ultimatums like she gave. It sucks that she\u2019s been Baker Acted and all I guess, but it\u2019s for the best right now. She\u2019ll have time to process it all in a safe environment and hopefully come to terms with it. Bad husband, I know. I\u2019m almost sure I\u2019m going for divorce. I\u2019m very worried about having her in the same house as my cats. I want my cats safe. I don\u2019t want to worry about them being harmed or \u201cdisappearing.\u201d Screw that. I guess I\u2019ll do what almost all of you suggested: \u201cKeep the cats, rehome the wife.\u201d Not how I *wanted* it to end, but life isn\u2019t always nice. **If I may, I want to clear up some things from the original post:** ***I did not stare at her all night.*** We have a mute TV with subtitles playing every night. I subtly watched TV while paying attention to the cat sounds. ***I\u2019m not allowed to install cat doors, and she won\u2019t let me keep the doors open.*** Apartment rules. ***Why did I instantly assume she was lying?*** I\u2019m unfamiliar with mental health/diseases. I know about some diseases, but ones that make you think your dreams happened? Tumors that make you see/hear/remember nonexistent things? Sorry that I wasn\u2019t aware of those possibilities. So when someone tells me events happened when they literally didn\u2019t, I generally assume they\u2019re lying. Shame on me. ***If you want even more context/questions answered, simply go through my comment history.***",

He seems very nervous around my daughter and has admitted in a passing comment here and there to my wife and I that he can\u2019t believe she agreed to date him and he thinks she\u2019s way out of his league. He seems very respectful, just shy.   My wife is usually an independent, awesome woman and her ideals align closely with mine particularly in term of feminism and equality. We have both striven to raise our daughter to be as independent and capable as possible.  Since my daughter has been dating this kid my wife has changed considerably and has given our daughter advice that has left me with raised brows more than once.  Some of the advice I\u2019ve heard my wife give is \u2018oh it\u2019s cute for boys to pay for everything, especially in your first relationship!\u2019 Or \u2018oh honey don\u2019t worry about that, he can pay for you, if he really liked you he would\u2019 and similar.  I\u2019ve tried to balance this out by telling my daughter straight away \u2018two people in a partnership should be contributing equally\u2019 and my personal favorite \u2018if someone asks if they can *take you out* to dinner, it\u2019s reasonable to expect them to pay, but if someone asks you to grab dinner with them, it\u2019s reasonable to split the payment\u2019. I figured that would be an easy way for a young person to understand the difference.  However I\u2019ve noticed my daughter becoming more and more entitled with her boyfriends money. They haven\u2019t been anywhere obviously since we\u2019re home but the way she talks about him \u2018oh I\u2019ll just ask him to pay for x\u2019 etc leaves a bad taste in my mouth. She has also flippantly bragged/ mentioned that she gets him to buy gift cards for her etc by mentioning her mother\u2019s advice, i.e. \u2018if you really liked me you\u2019d pay for x\u2019  I spoke to my wife privately and told her my concerns, she insists it\u2019s a rite of passage for girls and it\u2019s cute that she should feel a guy is completely spoiling her. I told her that it\u2019s not cute for her to be thinking it\u2019s acceptable to view relationships as personal ATMS, and my wife became very angry with me and is now calling me an asshole with a lot of hostility.",

It happened to me that they gave me nasty looks and I felt extremely uncomfortable the whole flight.  So I sat down in the plane and put the armrest up so I would be really comfortable. Some couple came and they both sat next to me because they got separate seats and they noticed the seat next to me was empty. Exactly what I was afraid of happened. My side kept touching the guy next to me and he even pushed me a bit when he moved in the seat. I was feeling extremely uncomfortable and asked him if he could go to his seat because I bought this one for my comfort. He told me no, since the seat is empty and he wants to be with his girlfriend. Well, I told him I understand but I feel uncomfortable and I paid for the second seat so exactly this doesn't happen. He refused again and started to chat with his GF. I called the flight attendant and quietly told her what is happening. She asked the guy to leave my second seat and he and his GF gave me a nasty look.

        "selftext": "Hi all.  I gave birth four weeks ago, and we decided to have a ''baby ceremony'', where everyone gets to meet our lovely daughter Charlotte.  My cousin Alice and her parents were among the guests. The first thing I'll say about her is that she has expensive taste. She's the sort of person who has a *minimum* price range for how much she spends on clothing. She doesn't own anything that isn't designer and has some items of clothing that cost thousands. She is a banker and still lives with parents so can afford the lifestyle.  It was Alice's turn to hold the baby and she was happy to at first, but suddenly Charlotte vomited on her. Alice handed Charlotte back to me and ran off crying, and spent the rest of the event crying in the car. I went to see her to apologise but she didn't want to hear any of it. My mum gave her one of her shirts which was too big for her and she felt completely upset and humiliated. Today I got a call from my mum, saying that she'd been on the phone to her sister (Alice's mum) saying that they want me to reimburse the cost of the blouse (roughly \u00a31800) since it was completely ruined.  I have said no. At the end of the day we all know what babies can be like. She took a risk wearing something so expensive knowing a baby was nearby and unfortunately it backfired. I feel bad for her but it was not my fault.  Am I doing the right thing by refusing to pay up?",

I never expected ever in my life that I'd be a mother to triplets so when I first became pregnant it was definitely the last thing in my mind.  I'm home with my babies all day long and had to even transfer my education to online.  Sometimes I just need some fresh air especially when I can't get them to stop crying and I find myself getting super frustrated to the point of tears, it's honestly soo hard and the dad isn't here to help as he's ether at work or at school.My fiance's (24) parents rented us a main floor apartment so when I step outside I'm literally just sitting on the chair right beside the door plus I have a baby monitor step up in their room and it has a camera on it I can literally see them and hear them so if anything happened I'd be able to quickly get to them.  Being able to step outside for a few minutes to take a breather is really important to me because I start to have mini panic attacks when I can't get them to stop crying and I get really frustrated because I just feel super overwhelmed, Being able to go outside just gives me a chance to clam down.  My fiance came home to me sitting outside while the babies were crying and freaked out on me calling me a horrible mom and a bunch of other names that I'm not gonna list here. He thinks that I was being super neglectful and putting the babies in harm way and even told his parents and now everyone seem to be really against me.  I grow up in the system my fiance's family is the only family I have and ever known so it breaks my hurt that they are so upset with me but I really don't think I was doing anything wrong or putting my babies in harm way but they seems to think otherwise. So here I am wondering if I should apologize for my actions or if I am the A-hole in this situation. ~~~~~~~~~ Update ~~~~~~~~~ I decided to show my fiance this thread at first he was really upset with me for sharing our personal problems with strangers on the internet even though it's anonymous.  But in the end when he had a chance to clam down and hear me and all of you guys out he actually apologized and promised me he'd be more involved with parenting and even is willing to take parenting classes which I'll hold him to that.  I just wanna thank everyone for the support that you all give me it brought tears to my eyes (happy tears) seeing how supportive you all were to a stranger on the internet I don't think I ever received this much support before.  I can't believe how much attention this post even got plus the award again thank you so much.",

        "selftext": " My fiance (31 male) and I (25 female) are getting married soon. There wasn't much that disagreed on during the wedding planning except for food. Me and my family are vegans, and there so many reasons why we chose this lifestyle and one of them being that we have a history of health issues. My fiance and his family are the complete opposite. they're hardcore meat eaters which is fine by me obviously. However, When deciding on the wedding food menu, I wanted to add 4-5 vegan options. My fiance and his mom objected saying it was a waste of money over food that 'isn't real food'. They also argued that this would be offensive for 'their' guests and suggested my vegan options just be the good ol' salads & appetizers (his mom wanted cupcakes lol). I said no because for one it's me and my family who's paying. and two I want to make my guests feel welcome and not be treated as second class citizens by being served salad. my fiance made a face and said isn't that what vegans eat?. I refused to argue about it and said it was final. The other day, I found out that he had cancelled all the vegan options and took them off the menu completely and behind my back. I was seething. I called him at work but he kept hanging up on me. I went straight to his workplace and confronted him there and just flipped out on him. He was stunned to see me. He at first said it was his mom's idea then told me to go home because I was making a scene at the office. the fight continued at home and he defended himself by saying that I sort of made him resort to doing this after I kept brushing off his thoughs and input, and refusing to accommadate his family. but there were PLENTY of meat options why why can't I get 4-5 vegan options? when I'm paying for it?. He yelled that it was his wedding too not my family's. My family said it was fine and they'll figure it out and told me to let it go but I refused. AITA for putting my foot down on this? UPDATE: So his mom messaged me earlier to try to get me to listen to what she had to say after I kept ignoring her phonecalls. She spent long walls of text just to address what I did at her son's workplace, calling it all kinds of stuff from immature to unhinged. She then went to explain how she's noticed that me and my family kept acting dismissive of her son's input and contributations to the wedding. She said that she noticed my behavior towards him and her entire family and wanted to speak up earlier but didn't and tried to keep the peace. She then went on to address the food menu issue and denied her involvement in the cancellation of the vegan option but that didn't mean she doesn't support her son's decision. moreover, she thought it was soooo responsible of him to make that move because of my continual refusal to see how this stuff is waste of money. she also pointed out how I kept saying I paid for it and said that technically this isn't just my money, it's mine and *his* because we're getting married she suggested I wisen up and get rid of my money, I paid for it mentality. She finally mentioned how bad this whole situation is making me look, and said that she and her son had already offered a number of compromises that I chose to brush off and decided to make it my weird hill to die on. She said that not only her son is upset but she and the family are as well after hearing about it and suggested I just agrre on their compromise and be done with it. This pissed me off beyond belief I responded by letting her know that I'm still standing my ground on this even if I'll have to call the whole wedding off because of it because honestly? this is just ridiculous, it is!!! my mom and dad....they don't even know what to say anymore. Apparently, my fiance saw my response to her (he's with her) and is now trying to call me but right now I'm waiting on him to get home and see if he's still insisting on the stance he took. I'll update if there's anything worth adding after we talk.",

        "selftext": "So I have a cat named Raven who's 3 years old. My girlfriend of 2 years moved in with me a few weeks ago and it was clear she didn't like my cat. I didn't think it was really a big deal until one day I got home and he was just gone. He's not an outdoor cat and he never goes outside.  He was gone for hours and I was worried sick until my buddy came to my house and returned him, saying he found him 2 blocks from my house. I asked my girlfriend how my cat, who has never tried to go out before ended up that far from my house and she admitted to kicking him out. I was furious, saying she had no right to kick him out and told her that since she thought she had the power to kick my cat out, I wanted her out of my house by the end of the month. She cried that she had nowhere to go and that she would have to live on the streets. I said I didn't care and told her to leave by the end of the month. My friends think I'm being too harsh, but my cat could have died because of her and I don't want her trying anything else. AITA?",

        "selftext": "I (46M) live with my wife and my 17 year old son. My wife has been on a different continent for about a month taking care of her dying mother, so it has just been me and my son for that time. My son and I have a very close relationship where he tells me almost everything going on in his life. On Saturday, he told me that he was going to his first ever high school party this upcoming weekend. He was a bit nervous since he had never really drank before, but he knew that he was going to on that occasion. I'm not sure if this is relevant, but this is in Canada where the drinking age is 19 (in my province), and teenage drinking is very common. I asked my son if he wanted to have a few beers with me while we watched a sports game that night, as a test run of sorts. My logic was that if he goes into the party with zero awareness of his tolerance then it could end badly, and it would be best for him to find out his limit in the safety of his home with me. We had some beers over a few hours in the night, and I cut him off at 6 (he has had beer in the past, but never more than one at a time). He was pretty drunk but he was okay, and slept it off. We talked about it the next day, and we agreed that six was a bit much for him, and now he knows to have fewer than that at the party. I was actually pretty content with this whole situation, since he had his first experience drinking in a safe environment, and I feel much more comfortable with him going to a party now. However, in an effort to be transparent I told my wife about it the other day over the phone, and she was livid. She thinks it was reckless and irresponsible. AITA? INFO: I understandably am getting flack for not telling my wife beforehand, but I figured she had enough going on and I didn't need to bother her with something that seemed pretty trivial at the time EDIT: Thanks for all the comments, I am reading every single one! I appreciate the different perspectives",

        "selftext": "I am a hiring manager at a tech company and I was hiring for summer internships a little while ago. We had a guy, about 19 years old, applying for a summer internship between his freshman and sophomore years of college. It was a virtual interview over Zoom because of covid.  A minute or two in, when I was introducing myself, his mom came in and introduced herself and started talking about her son's work ethic. I thought it was a little strange. I said something polite about wanting to hear from him. She just didn't get the hint and kept coming into camera frame during the interview and interrupting her son to answer questions for him. I asked a few technical questions which he seemed to answer well and then cut the interview fairly short. I thought that was all over and done with until I'd gotten an email from a woman, a month later, asking about her son's application, she seemed offended he hadn't gotten an acceptance or rejection.  It bothered me, I felt bad for the kid honestly. Wayyy back when I was a teenager, my mom used to pull the same shit, but luckily she only did that when I was 15 and working for a day-camp, not when I was an adult applying for engineering jobs. But I felt like this poor kid was getting his chances ruined because his mom wasn't giving him the chance to apply on his own. I sent an email back saying I was not at liberty to send information about an application to anybody but the applicant. I also asked HR to send an email to the kid saying sorry but we were not making him an offer. (It is something we usually do, but his rejection email must have slipped through the cracks with all the Covid craziness.) Anyway, after we sent that, I got a phone call from his mom, she had a forwarded copy of the email, and she was demanding answers. I said that I could not comment on the guy's performance in the interview to her as she was not the applicant. If he wanted to reach out to me I was happy to give him some feedback.  However, I could say that regardless of his performance, her presence in the interview took him out of consideration for the position. We were looking for an independent and self-driven person for the position, and for that reason, it is important to see an applicant speak for themselves, follow-up themselves, etc. I also said that, as a piece of advice, every hiring manager I've met in my career who sees someone other than the applicant answering questions during an interview, following up on the applicant's behalf, etc... Would also put their resume in the do not hire pile. Since, while the applicant may be skilled and motivated, they need the ability to demonstrate those traits themselves.  She fucking blew up at me over that, kinda cussing me out to the point where I hung up. AITA for how I handled this? Maybe I should have kept my mouth shut way earlier",

        "selftext": "  I f32 gave birth to my son 5 weeks ago. My husband's mom has been camping in the living room ever since and inviting people over, making a mess in the house, etc. I said nothing because if I open my mouth, my husband would start scolding me saying his mom is there to help and I should be grateful. What I did was ignore her and focus on my son. I handle feeding, diaper change, cleaning, wiping. I only get a few hours sleep so my husband's mom isn't really helping with the baby. But I thought to myself well, at least she cooks for us!. Last night, I was in the bedroom breastfeeding my son. I knew I was late for dinner but I thought that my husband and his mom saved a plate for me. Once I got done with my son, I walked out the room and saw my husband and his mom sitting watching tv. I asked about dinner and my husband said it was probably on the stove. As I was walking towards the kitchen, his mom loudly said that she didn't save me any food. I was absolutely shocked I asked her why and she simply said Well, we didn't see you at dinner table so I thought you weren't hungry. I lost it and yelled that I was feeding my son OF COURSE I was hungry, I was actually starving!. She shrugged her shoulders and said it wasn't her fault I didn't show up for dinner but she knew damn well that I was with my son and hadn't eaten a thing in hours!. My husband asked me to not raise my voice at his mom but I told him that he saw what happened and didn't think about me being hungry and needing food. he lashed out asking what the fuck I wanted him to do and I said I don't know, maybe save some food for me? She defended him saying it was selfish of me to basically berate him for eating his dinner after working for long hours at the department. An argument ensued and I went inside the bedroom, packed a small bag for me and my son, called my brother to come take me to mom's house and my husband blew up at me as I was making my way out. We argued at the door and he told me that what I was doing was uncalled for and childish. I told him I couldn't take his mom anymore, he said I should be ashamed of myself for talking about her like that after she literally put her life on pause so she could help ME out. My brother came and I got into the car and left. He picked some food for me on the way and I ate like a hungry bear. My husband never stopped calling though. In his last text he called me nuts and demanded I return today but I said that I miss my mom, that I like it here in her clean home with her healthy food and would like to stay for a while. He's lost it and got his family involved accusing me of keeping his son away from him and punishing him over food.  **Edit...Ok, to those who are saying that I'm keeping my husband away from his son, I promise you that he has full access to him but chooses not to come over simply because he hats my mom and refuses to be with her in the same room. How long am I going to stay here??? There's no telling but at least I'm being pampered and treated like a princess by my mom, dad, brothers - heck, I couldn't get this treatment in my own home!. As for my husband, He can come over to mom's house if he wants to see his son so badly but I doubt he'll do it since he's a very prideful person and this might hurt his ego.** **one more question to answer cause a lot of people asked me to clarify. Yes, Department = Police Department. He's a police officer. I'm sorry if you got confused, but I thought it was clear.**    **Edit Ok, I felt sorry for him and decided to send him a couple of pictures that I took of our son sleeping and what was his respons? A long wall of text berating me left and right and claiming that I was rubbing it in his face that he can't come see his son because of you know what!!. He called me the b word which he never did til now and I'm shaken and so so mad right now because I really thought I was doing something nice and considerate after having sympathy for him. I've decided to get the rest of my stuff tomorrow because I need more time and space to be able to think about what he's done and said. I feel terrible right now but at least I got dinner for tonight, unlike when I was at my own home when his mom first came** **Edit. OH MY GOD, I can't even find a place to start with this. So he just sent me a picture of him and his mom cooking dinner in the kitchen (it's nearly 7 pm here) saying that he was repaying me for the pictures I sent earlier and that they were making dinner and they were not including me for real this time ?????? I just....Oh my God I'm literally laughing like, seriously, what is this? I'm truly speechless!. I haven't responded to this (yet) and I don't think I will because I'm so angry right now and may just regret the words that I say to him. I'm gonna put the phone on silent or something for now because I don't want them to ruin yet another night but tomorrow I'm going to collect more of mine and my son's stuff so I could stay longer at my mom's house. Thank God I went anonymous with this and I might update later if anything new happens. Goodnight!** **Edit. God I can't believe I'm back on here, but he just sent me a text saying he's only willing to come over IF I could get mom out of the house tomorrow, like literally have her leave her own house! He said it's just for 2 hours so he could see his son and also talk (he doesn't even know I'm coming over tomorrow to pick more stuff for me and the baby). I'm freaking out! Like absolutely no, not happening. I wouldn't dream of telling mom to leave her own house, that's crazy out of line request!!!. I'm not sure wether to respond or what I should say to him but I'll try to get some sleep then see how it goes in the morning!. I'm too tired to do anything but I Just wanted to put this here for those who just read my thread, I'll let you know what happens tomorrow. Aright!.**",

        "selftext": "I\u2019m going to be vague for privacy reasons, sorry.   I (33F) am the breadwinner of our household. I have multiple, highly specialized degrees for a niche industry. I make 200k+, with potential to get in the 600-M\u2019s range. My company has not been hit that badly by COVID, so most of us have kept our jobs, but we\u2019re held to strict standards.   My husband (36M) has a broad degree/work experience. He quit his job right before COVID hit, hoping for a better job in the meantime, and I was supportive. He spent a ton of time applying to various jobs, and finally landed an interview at Organization X.  This is his dream job, in almost every imaginable way (I can\u2019t be detailed). However, it\u2019s paying about 65k a year, which would be fine except this job directly puts my job stability at risk.  My company and this org. are adversarial, at best. My field is extremely secretive, and if clients discovered my spouse was working for a competitor, I would be permanently tainted. I wouldn\u2019t be able to get a job in the industry forever. I know this sounds like an exaggeration, but I promise you, it absolutely is not. It\u2019d be like if I worked in protecting the privacy of celebrities, and he worked for TMZ. If he tapped my car, got into my work devices, he could use that to advance his career, and any trust I have in this field will be gone. Even if I trusted my husband not to do that, my clients and company don\u2019t. Worse, b/c my background is so specialized, this is the only field I can work in.  I asked him to drop from consideration for this job, since if he got it, we\u2019d lose my income. 65k a year cannot support us in this city. Plus, he does not have to work for this organization. Even if the job market is awful right now, his background gives him access to a wide range of jobs, but I only have this one, niche field.  He was extremely angry, and said I was \u201cselfish and only cared about money.\u201d I told him that if he wanted to go back to school for an advanced degree or just be unemployed for a while, I would support him, but taking this job isn\u2019t possible.  He continued the process behind my back, and got the offer. He wants to accept it, b/c he says his career needs to take priority and that I wasn\u2019t being a supportive wife.  I feel so betrayed, and I\u2019ve contacted all relevant higher ups in my company to inform them. I notified them as soon as he got the interview, b/c it\u2019s better coming from my email than from a background check.  I told him he could decline the offer, w/me watching him physically decline it, or he could accept the offer and move out immediately. I would pay for him to stay two weeks at a hotel, and we would begin divorce proceedings. My company is willing to take care of all of my legal fees.  I feel fucking awful. I still love him. I moved decisively, b/c this was the best way to cut my losses, but it still hurts. He called me heartless and cold. It\u2019s true that I was prioritizing my career over his, but it felt like the only option at the time.",

        "selftext": "For some weird reason my MIL really wants to go into our bedroom whenever she comes over.  On one occasion I followed her as she went upstairs (i was going to get something for my child as the bedrooms are upstairs) and she walked past the bathroom on the main floor and up the stairs behind it.  She didn\u2019t hear me and I caught her walking straight into my room and rifling through bills on my dresser.  She denied snooping (even though I\u2019d just watched her do it) and said she was just going to use our bathroom because she couldn\u2019t find the other ones. She walked right past the one on the main floor and another one in the upstairs hallway to go into our bedroom. Since that happened, I installed an exterior doorknob that requires a key on our bedroom door and one on the door to our office/spare bedroom.  However, she\u2019s still always \u201cforgetting\u201d where the bathroom is and trying the bedroom and office door.  This really ticks me off.  My husband says that I just get annoyed at this because everything she does drives me crazy and since we\u2019ve put locks on the rooms we don\u2019t want her in, there isn\u2019t really a problem anymore.   Well over the holidays we had my in laws over for dinner and before they came I was searching for the bedroom keys. We hadn\u2019t used them in a while since we only lock the doors when MIL comes over.  My husband told me we didn\u2019t need to lock the doors since she wouldn\u2019t try to get into the rooms and I insisted that she would because she loves to snoop.  We went back and forth and decided to cover the doorknobs in super fine glitter to see if she tried them.   I did this once before when husband didn\u2019t believe me about the snooping to prove she\u2019d been in the rooms.  Last time she ignored the glitter and we didn\u2019t say anything about it but then my husband couldn\u2019t deny that she\u2019d tried to snoop.  So this time I covered the knobs in glitter and for the office went a touch further and rigged a little folder of glitter over the door to the office before the in laws came over.  I left it one side unlocked (French doors) and it was set so if you walked in the room you would get covered in glitter.  Husband goes out of his way to show his mom the main floor bathroom when they got here and specifically asks his parents and sister not to go upstairs.  There\u2019s a  baby gate so the kids can\u2019t get upstairs either.  Well guess who had to go to the bathroom and got covered in glitter and had it all over their hands and hair?  She completely lost it and started screaming at me so I yelled back and now my husband is saying I went too far and I\u2019m the asshole.  MIL also says I\u2019m the asshole but SIL says I didn\u2019t do anything wrong and MIL deserved it for snooping.  FIL is Switzerland.  Apparently her car is ruined now too because it\u2019s covered in glitter that she cant get cleaned up. So AITA? ETA: I can\u2019t believe this blew up and I wanted to say thank you for all the support and the awards!  My husband woke up and found this post and I think the comments have been an eye opener.  We are going to start couple\u2019s therapy in January so I think that will be great for us.   I will be ordering some cellulose glitter that is biodegradable and safer for future projects.   And if she comes over again I will set up a camera haha or at least print out some fun fake documents so if she snoops again she can at least find something interesting :)",

        "selftext": "I've worked at my office for 8 years. I'm on good terms with management and most of my co-workers.\u200b Five months ago, a new guy was hired on a 6-month probationary period. I'm not his supervisor, but I'm definitely a senior employee. I'll call the guy Ted Faro, because he's a dick. \u200b Supervisor was going around introducing Ted to people, and when he got to me said This is John and described my job. \u200b Ted: Hi, Jack. Me: It's John. \u200bTed: What?\u200b Me: My name's John, not Jack. Ted: It's close enough for me. Supervisor: His name's John, not Jack. Let's move on. \u200b This continued for a few months. Despite reminders from supervisors (when he referred to me when I wasn't present) and myself, he continued to use the name Jack. I finally told him You either use my name, or I ignore you completely, no matter what the situation is. \u200b His response was Sure thing, Jackie boy. \u200b Since I don't work directly with him, I figured screw it and that I'd ignore him. \u200b Recently he had a 2-day business trip that required car rental. I work late some nights, and Ted came to me and says Hey, Jack, I'll be dropping the rental car off at 7 when I get back. See you there for a lift back to the office! \u200b (they closed at 6 and there's a drop box) \u200b As promised, I ignored him. \u200b 7:15 rolls around on the night he's dropping off and I get a call. I recognize his number, so I ignored it. He called 7 more times, then starts e-mailing. The first one was along the lines of Jack I'm at Enterprise. Come pick me up. E-mails pour in every 5-10 minutes, addressing me as Jack, Jack-o, Jackie, and Jackie-boy. The emails also started being laced with profanity and a couple threats. \u200b I signed out and went home. It was raining hard. Next morning, I saw that Ted had sent a few more e-mails. I printed them off. At 10am, he storms up to my desk and  screams Where the [f-bomb] were you? I told you when to pick me up! I HAD TO TAKE A CAB! DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH THAT COST ME?! He goes on like that for a bit until his supervisor came and hauled him away and asked to speak to me. \u200b Supervisor: Ted tells me that you ignored his requests for a pickup when he dropped off the rental. He was caught out in the rain. \u200b I relayed what happened, and showed him the printed e-mails. I'd highlighted the threats. Supervisor: I can see why you wouldn't want to spend time around him. But it was still kind of inconsiderate to leave him stranded in the rain. That's not the greatest neighborhood and he could have been hurt. he sighed and said With the threats and him being on probation, he no longer works here. Just try not to be an a-hole in retaliation to your coworkers. \u200b A few people at the office have commented that I'm the jerk for ignoring Ted and getting him riled up, which got him fired. \u200b *AM* I the a-hole on this?",

        "selftext": "A few nights ago, I hosted a game night for a small group of friends (we had all been quarantining and following the proper guidelines in my county). It was only going to be 5 of us (including me), but one of my friends texted me last minute that she was going to bring a coworker from work (Matt-fake name). Fine with me. We started playing a card game where you answer questions about yourself; based on the level (Level 1, 2, 3), the question could be extremely surface level (ex. what's your favorite color?) to something deeper (ex. what characteristic of yourself do you not like about yourself?). Everyone was enjoying themselves, and I was happy with the way things were going. Cue a question I drew: What's the hardest thing you've ever had to go through? Some backstory: My sister passed away a few years ago when I was still in high school. I was pulled out of class and flew immediately to her college and watched her die in the ICU. Needless to say, this is probably the hardest thing I've been through. 3 of my friends in the group knew about this, the other 2 and Matt did not. I didn't want to bring the mood down, so I answered that the hardest thing I'd been through was transitioning going to a college in a different state where I knew no one. We were all ready to move on, but Matt immediately piped up and said, Wow, if that's the hardest thing you've ever been through, you live an extremely privileged life.  Everyone got quiet. Now, if he had said it jokingly, I probably would have let it go and moved on. However, the way he said it was in a very condescending and patronizing tone, and I will admit, it rubbed me the wrong way. Instead of letting it go, I said well, the hardest thing I've ever been through is seeing my sister die in the ICU and having to watch her being lowered into her grave when I was 17. I just didn't want to bring the mood down. If things were quiet before, they were dead silent now. Matt mumbled an apology but game night ended shortly after. After my friends all left, my friend who had brought Matt texted me and told me I was a jerk for making Matt look bad, and I could have just let his statement go. I do feel bad about what I said and being the cause of game night ending so soon, but I also feel like I was just making a justified statement. AITA?",

        "selftext": "I was raised mostly by my uncle and aunt.  My older sister developed a serious illness when I was 6 and my parents decided that they couldn\u2019t care for both of us I guess, so they kind of unceremoniously dumped me at my grandparents and my uncle took me in. Like, didn\u2019t even explain to me what was going on, just \u201cyou\u2019re going to go visit gran for awhile\u201d and never picked me back up.  My grandparents and uncle explained it later, and they were pretty livid at my parents. I\u2019ve seen my parents maybe 5 times since then and not at all for the last 9 years.  I decided to stop having contact with them when I was 12 and since I was the only one reaching out all communication broke down.  It turned out ok, I love my aunt and uncle and it turns out they can\u2019t have kids so they\u2019ve always said I\u2019m their miracle kid, I was just misrouted by the stork at first. I was formally adopted by them when I turned 18, I wish it had been earlier but there were some red tape things that would have made that really expensive and difficult. I\u2019m 21 now. My sister passed away between thanksgiving and Christmas and I made a trip back from school for the funeral, but I stayed in the back and left before my bio parents could talk to me.  They called my uncle to try to talk to me, but I said I didn\u2019t want to so he told them that I wasn\u2019t available at the moment. They finally caught up to me over Christmas when I went to midnight mass with my gran, and approached me and tried to give me a hug.  I did recognize them, but I pretended not to and just backed off and said \u201cSorry, do I know you?\u201d They said \u201cWe\u2019re your parents!\u201d and I said \u201cMy parents are at home.\u201d and went and sat down with my gran. They sat behind us and I could just feel the stare, and on the way out they were like \u201cYou really don\u2019t recognize us?\u201d And I said \u201cOh, are you my dad\u2019s brother? I think I remember you from when I was little.\u201d My gran thinks they deserved it trying to come back to me like nothing happened, but they wrote me a long letter about how hurt they are and how I should understand that they were trying to do the right thing and how they\u2019ll always be my parents and I can\u2019t change that. Other family members think I was too harsh as they\u2019re grieving, but I don\u2019t think they should get a pass just because they remembered me now that my sister is gone.",

        "selftext": "I [20 F] am an older sister to my little (biological) brother (17 M) who finished high school last year. My little brother and I are really close. He says I'm the best friend he has and he loves me more than anyone (of course this is not true, he has many friends of his own). My brother has been asking our step-dad/mother if he could get a new car for his grad party since last year, and he said he'd pay 50-75% with his own hard-earned money while they paid the rest. They said no. I have a car but I had been working for one, they helped me pay off for it. So my brother's arguments with our parents got heated after awhile (one time I told my brother that I'd help him pay off expenses for a good car once I got my own. He hugged me and said I didn't need to worry and that he owed me way more than I owed him). But he continued to press our parents all of last year until they gave in and said yes like they did for me. Note that our step-dad and my brother have a negative relationship for the most part. Our bio mother and step-dad got together soon after our bio dad and mom divorced when we were little. My brother thinks that step-dad and mother were seeing each other before our real parents divorced and tbh, I think that might be true. Not certain, though. Anyway, my step-dad, mother and brother compromised and said they'd get him the car in 2021 so that people don't gawk at him at the graduation party. June this year my brother and step-dad/mother are still on about the car, now the arguments getting loud and lasting hours until evening. My step-dad was getting into screaming matches with my brother over it but they reached a final compromise of the car being bought last week.  The fated morning comes and my brother wakes up to our step-dad and mom guiding him outside to... a car. But not his, our mother's. Step-dad used his and my brother's money on a dumb prank, bought a completely different model of car, and said it was for our mother. Our mom and step dad just laughed and kissed each other. My brother didn't lose it, he didn't even look angry. He just looked dead in our step-dad's eyes and said, and I'm not joking, verbatim: you might think I'm fucking stupid, you might think whatever. But I'm just better than you, bro. You know that, I know that, and our mom is a fucking idiot for staying with a prick like you. But I'll make you wish you'd never fucking met us. I promise you. You might be laughing now, but you'll be crying later. He then walked off, not even looking back at them as they stared horrified. They asked me what was that about and I, feeling terrible for my brother, said they had it coming and not to be surprised. So now they grounded both of us. I've had to explain the situation to my friends as I can't see them anymore but I feel so bad for my baby brother and they back me up on this and ask me to comfort him as much as possible. But our parents are so mad, and they can't see that my brother had his heart crushed. AITA?",

        "selftext": "My fiance M33, and I F28 are getting married in december. His mom is the intrusive type but she's nice overall and we....somewhat get along. I hate to admit that wedding planning has been an absolute nightmare. His mom wasn't willing to agree on most things, and my fiance said that since he's her only son then I should respect and appreciate this vision she has for the wedding and how it should be. She insisted to come along for wedding dress shopping. I took her with me and my mom and friends. I was so lucky to have found what I was looking for. but she picked a dress that she liked so much and said that she always pictured her son's bride in it mom and friends thought this line was creepy. I thought the dress was somewhat creepy and toooootally not my type. I apologized and thanked her for her vision but told her that I'd already decided on a dress that I had envisioned myself wearing at my wedding!. She got all pissy because of it apparently, then must've told my fiance because, he came home in the evening ranting about how I made his mom upset and turned down her help in choosing the wedding dress and excluded her from the process. I asked what process? duh it's just a wedding dress...my wedding dress so I really didn't get how she should get a say at all!. He got upset and said that this attitude of mine isn't working on him or his mom. He said that I should consider the dress his mom wanted me to buy especially knowing that both dresses weren't that much different anyway like she said but I told him yes they were different...like so much different. Anyways, We argued about it then we dropped it. Yesterday I came home and found out that he had returned my wedding dress and replaced it with the one his mom wanted. I called him and he was straightforward about what he did and why he did it. I lost it and started screaming at him. He asked me to calmn down and really give this dress a chance. I refused to even listen I screamed at him without giving him a chance to speak. He got home and we had an argument. I then went to stay with one of my friends and he kept calling and calling then texting saying that I overreacted and it's his wedding too so it wasn't cool how I screamed at him. He insisted I give this dress a chance. He went on and on about how his mom has a vision and good intentions and just wants what best for me as her future daughter inlaw. Mom is livid and has been wanting to go scream at him and his mom but my dad said that this isn't worth ruining my relationship with my inlaws. He suggested I wisen up and go with the flow but is it too much for me to be able to pick my own wedding dress without being guilted about it just to keep the peace?. AITA for my reaction? ETD Q & As I'm editing in some answers to frequent questions I get. A. The dress she picked wasn't all too crazy but just wasn't my type. B. This issue started during wedding planning and there were other things...like way too many things we didn't agree on. but this vision has been there for...quite a while. C. I AM paying for the dress obviously. D. My fiance's dad is deceased. also, his mom suffered from multiple health conditions. Has no daughters but one only son. E. He's still presisting...",

I have not eaten meat since I was roughly 3-4 years old when I found out where meat comes from (spoiler alert: there were a lot of tears). This is no secret and everyone in my life knows and respects this - or so I thought.  Four nights ago, I was at a party and I will admit, I got white girl wasted. My friends thought it would be funny to feed me chicken nuggets as a prank. I checked with them before chowing down are these vegan? To which my friends replied yeah, they're sunfed (a type of vegan chickenless chicken). They tasted off to me but I figured it was just because I was drunk. I was wrong.  I found out the next day when my sister sent me a message telling me to check my friends Snapchat story. The story was them showing the nugget packaging, and then showing them giving them to me (including the conversation where I asked if it was vegan). The and then later them mocking me and pretending to be me when I found out I ate meat (things like fake crying and yelling the CHICKENS!!!). I took a screen recording of the video and took it to the police, on the grounds of food tampering, and now 3 of my (ex) friends are facing charges.  They all think that I'm overreacting to a 'harmless' prank, so Reddit, AITA? In my view, they took advantage of my drunken state, tampered with my food, and publically humiliated me. In their view, it was just a prank.",

        "selftext": "My stepsister (20F) and I (24M) have never gotten along. Her mom and my dad got married when we were six and ten so we've known each other for a long time. In my stepmom's eyes, she could do no wrong and anything bad that happened was pinned on me. My dad is a complete pushover so he would always fall over to whatever my stepmom would say. When I was about 15, I started gaining weight. My gf broke up with me (woohoo high school romance), I started failing some of my classes, and I quit baseball. I started to stress-eat and ballooned up from 125 pounds to 162. I guess at that point she decided she was cooler than I was and started mocking me and making fun of me, calling me names like fatass and chubster. I would constantly go to my stepmom about it and she would tell me she's just teasing, she's so much younger, why are you getting upset? I got pissed off to the point where I just started avoiding her and locking myself upstairs in my room with a bag of chips. At 22 I hit 270 pounds and I knew I had gone too far. I was way past my weight limit and bordering on obese. So as a New Year's resolution, I decided to start losing weight. I cut out all junk food and started hitting the gym. Around this time my stepsister started to overeat too, I don't really know why but she gained over 30 pounds. She still was constantly belittling me about my weight (which admittedly, was way over hers). By the end of this year, I lost 120 lbs. It felt amazing. My stepsister now weighed more than me. Over Christmas dinner, all the aunts and uncles and cousins were complimenting me on my weight loss, telling me how I looked so much better. My stepsister just sat there smoldering. Every time someone said something she'd add, He's still pretty big, Well he didn't get rid of that face roundness, Maybe lose a little more around that gut. It was infuriating and I was getting angrier. Now here's where I might be TA. Finally, at her last little snide, Look, you know you'll just put it all back on. Why do you even bother? I flipped out. I yelled, Why can't you just be happy for me, instead of getting on me for every little thing?She said back to me, Defensive much?  Oh, I'm sorry. Did I hurt your 200-pound feelings? I asked her. I probably should have stopped there but I kept going. Calling me a fatass. Look at your plate! You've eaten half the table, fatty! She started crying and left the table. My stepmom screamed at me, saying just because I was insecure I can't take it out on everyone. I said, Oh, so *now* you're talking. Not in the past ten years of constant 'fatty' and 'lardass' and 'porker'!  But you're way older! she whined. I left the table too and went home. I woke up today to a thousand messages from my stepmom, my dad, and my stepsister. They were saying I wasn't welcome to their house until I apologized. I'm not going to. AITA? EDIT: Thank you so much everyone for your comments and the awards. I've never felt better about myself than now. And yes, I understand that 270 lbs was not bordering on obese. I'm 6'0 so I was pretty damn obese. I called myself bordering for a few years after getting fat, it made me feel better than classifying myself as morbidly obese.",

        "selftext": "Edit: Update. I want to thank you all for the kind words and comments. I knew after reading the comments that it was time to come to a resolution. I decided to drive home from work and talk with Erica. When I showed up Leah\u2019s car was parked in the drive. I went inside and they were watching tv. I told Leah immediately to get out, she tried to argue but I told her if she didn\u2019t then I\u2019m calling the police. Erica tried to get pissy that I kicked her friend out but I said I\u2019m done talking about Leah because at this point nothing is changing with that relationship. Sat Erica down and showed her this post. 20 minutes of reading later I asked her what she thought, she said \u201cthose people don\u2019t understand our relationship or Leah\u201d. I knew then that it was over. I asked her to hold out her hand and I took the ring off. She begged saying she is sorry and she\u2019ll cut Leah off etc. I told her I can\u2019t even trust her with the garage code, how am I supposed to trust her as my wife. She\u2019s locked herself in our room now. I\u2019m in the kitchen packing up her things. I called her dad/mom telling them about what has happened and they were furious. Leah is apparently banned from their house and has been since HS. I didn\u2019t know this but her parents said it\u2019s been like this since Hs. They are coming this weekend to get Erica and the stuff. I couldn\u2019t be any happier than I am right now. A huge weight feels lifted off my shoulders. I felt like if I never made this post I wouldn\u2019t have ever seen how messed up my life had become. Sincerely thank you everyone. Can\u2019t wait to take my clubs out and play a round now that I have more free time. Really excited to see what single life brings and can\u2019t thank you all enough again.   Me (29M) and Erica (27F) dated for 2 years and have been engaged the last 4 months. After we got engaged Erica moved into my house. I still pay the mortgage while she pays for utilities, Groceries and household items. After we get married the plan is to put her on the house so she gets equity as well. Her friend Leah (27F) and her have been best friend since high school. I don\u2019t particularly like Leah but have also been cordial as I know she\u2019s gonna be in my life. My issue is Leah thinks of my home as hers. Couple examples\u2026 She always brings her boyfriend over and he\u2019s a sketchball. She talks to me in a very disrespectful way in my own house, like I\u2019m a guest and she/Erica own it. One day I went out to my garage and some of my tools were missing. I checked my camera and Leah/BF were in my garage with Erica and took some tools with them. I asked Erica and she said they were just borrowing and would return them. I had to reach out multiple times for them to finally return the tools weeks later. I have a nice wine/liquor collection and I was working late one Friday. While working I heard some clanking of bottles together. Erica wasn\u2019t home so I went out to see what was up. Leah was behind my bar. I asked what she was doing and she said that Erica told her it was okay to borrow a bottle of wine for her party and that she would pay it back. I told her no that wasn\u2019t alright and to leave. I asked Erica about this and she said \u201cI don\u2019t remember telling Leah she could take a bottle but I might have I don\u2019t remember\u201d. I told her at this point I wasn\u2019t comfortable with Leah being in my house, Erica sorta understood but also blew me off.  Final straw came when I wanted to go hit some golf balls and my clubs were missing. I freaked out because i golf regularly and my clubs are my biggest investment. Went to check the camera again and Leah used my garage code and took the clubs. I blew up, called Erica and told her to get them back immediately. Erica said Leah had asked for the garage code to grab some clothes from her closet and not my clubs. I threatened to call the police but Erica stopped me. Leah kept telling us that her boyfriend needed them for a work thing. I got them back almost 4 days after they were taken and they were dirty. At this point I sat Erica down and told her that if I see Leah in my house again then I\u2019m calling the cops, no discussion. Erica got upset saying that it\u2019s her best friend and that wasn\u2019t fair to do to her in our house. I said it\u2019s a pattern and since Erica\u2019s stuff isn\u2019t affected she doesn\u2019t care. I said she can go over to Leah\u2019s if she wants to see her. She said she can\u2019t do this because Leah doesn\u2019t like her apartment and Leah\u2019s BF is always there which makes Erica uncomfortable. I\u2019m now getting the silent treatment and getting called an AH but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m doing anything wrong. AITA?",

She realized that she was gay, since I've been trying to hard to please myself from men. We broke up. The very next day, I get bombarded with text messages. My friends asked if this was true, and they linked me to a post. It was a Facebook (who uses Facebook) post (exposing me) about me cheating. She said that's why we broke up. Now I usually am not evil, but this pissed me off. She was destroying my reputation, for god knows why. I simply commented that the real reason that we broke up was because she is gay. People didn't believe me, until my ex literally screamed at me for outing her. Then a lot of people started to call her out for her lies. I know I'm probably a huge asshole. Though I feel like she deserves it. But alas, AITA? No. I did not cheat on her. Yes. I did have sex with someone the day that we broke up. But it was after.",

        "selftext": "So background: I (32f) have a brother, Dave (35m), who's married to Sarah (29f). They don't have children yet. I have a son who just turned four and a three-month-old daughter with my husband (39m). My husband and I live in Belgium most of the time, but we travel back to visit my family about once a month (in England). At home, we speak both English and French to our children (my husband is Belgian), and right now, my son is in this very sweet phase where he'll sometimes mix up the two languages and say a couple of words in English in a French sentence or vice-versa. This has never posed a problem to us, and even the staff at his nursery have reassured us that it's very common and they tend to grow out of it once they start at school. My sister-in-law has decided that this is a problem, so when we're visiting my parents and she notices my son doing this, she'll correct him, but she does so really rudely, whereas my husband and I will just gently correct him. Anyway, we're visiting at the moment and she's now decided that instead of correcting him, she's just going to start ignoring him when he does this. I sort of noticed her doing it when we arrived, and I thought it was odd, but assumed maybe she was just stressed (her job is quite intense), but it only really became an issue yesterday. My husband was talking to my dad outside and I was feeding my daughter in the other room, and I'd left Louis with Sarah and Dave. When I came back downstairs, Louis was crying, and I managed to understand that he'd tried to ask Sarah for a drink (he has a special cup he uses that he was holding, so it was obvious what he meant) but that she'd just ignored him. I asked her why and she explained that she wasn't going to reply to him unless he said the sentence correctly and that I shouldn't be ignoring my son's obvious speech issues. For context, it's not that she didn't know what he wanted. She told me that she understood exactly what he was asking for, but that she was deliberately refusing because he hadn't asked correctly. This really pissed me off, but luckily my husband came inside at that moment and pulled me away so we could calm down and settle Louis. That night at the dinner table, Sarah asked me to pass her something, but she said it in bad English (she IS English, I just mean that she asked for it in slang. Think, Pass *us* the peas, will you. I had a bit of an epiphany and I just decided to totally ignore her. She asked again, and I did the same thing. My brother asked why I was ignoring his wife and I said that I'm not able to reply if she can't speak English correctly and that it's wrong of him to ignore her obvious issues with grammar. Everyone's pretty pissed off with me and I admit it was incredibly childish, but she was needlessly being a dickhead to my baby. Should I just apologise? **Edit: WOW this really blew up. Thanks for all the comments and support, and thanks for all the ESH/YTA messages too. I'm not going to apologise to her, because, to be quite frank, I think she deserved it, but I will have a conversation with her and my brother before we leave to try and explain that, for one thing, it's completely normal, and, more importantly, that if she keeps correcting or ignoring my son, I'll be severely limiting their contact. Although I doubt if I'll ever leave him alone in a room with her again anyway.** **To answer a few of the most common questions: When I said everyone was mad at me, I meant my brother, his wife and my parents (although, my parents don't agree with what Sarah's doing either. They're more trying to keep the peace). My husband is entirely on my side, and when he realised what Sarah had done to Louis (he only saw the aftermath), he wanted to cut short the trip.** **Sarah (and the rest of my family), only speak English, which I suppose goes some way towards explaining why she doesn't understand it. I do think it's a monolingual reaction because we've never experienced anything similar in Belgium.** **One final thing - lots of questions about why we're in the UK so often. My husband has to be in London for his job about once a month/ once every six weeks, so we tag along. I freelance, and a few of my clients are UK based, so it's a good opportunity for me to fit in a few meetings too. It also gives us the chance to bring Louis and Misha over to see my parents before Louis starts school, and we have to cut down on the visits.**",

        "selftext": "My sisters car broke down 6 months ago because of her own stupidity. I won't go into it here but she ignored the advice of a mechanic and because of that her car broke. I decided to be nice and offer my sister my car until she could get hers fixed as i could bike to work while she needed to drive. She did not get her car fixed for some reason. She claimed to be saving money to do so but every time her paycheck came she spent it. My parents have even offered her a loan to fix her car but she refused. Along with all of this, she has been abusing my generosity and taking my car all day and night. I told her she could use it for work but is seems to her that is a free pass to use my car, not fill it with gas, and take it when I specifically tell her not to.  Recently I've been needed to get to work very early and I really don't feel like riding my bike 6 miles at 3 in the morning so I told my sister she had 30 days until I took the spare key from her and she is no longer allowed to use it. That was 32 days ago. Yesterday morning she woke up specifically before me to take my car (at 2:30 in the morning). I called her and demanded she bring it back but she just hung up on me. because of this I reported it stolen.  My sister was arrested 30 minutes later and my parents had to go bail her out. My sister is now facing charges for unauthorized use of a car and my parents and her are pissed. They claim I want way to far here but honestly, i feel justified. My parents are worried if she's found guilty she will loose her job but in my opinion, it's her own fault. Am i wrong here? Am i an asshole?",

        "selftext": " So, I'm getting married to my fiance soon. I bought my wedding dress weeks ago. His my (FMIL) kept pestering me about trying it on but I firmly refused. I finally shut it down after she offered me 100$ to let her try it on. Her reasoning for presisting so much? She says it's because of her love for wedding dresses and her obsession with them. Fast forward to yesterday, I came home from work early and I found my fiance at home. He freaked out after seeing me and tried to prevent me from going into my room while trying to text somebody on his phone. I opened the door and was shocked to see his mom standing there wearing my dress. I instantly pulled out my phone and took a photo of her in it. Sheand my fiance freaked out after I told her that she needed to pay me for a new dress in 3 days or else I'll show the whole family the photo. She started crying and then left and my fiance blew up at me saying I can't be serious and that I overreacted because his mom just wanted to try the dress on, no harm done. But I refused to listen to him because in my opinion, the dress should only be worn by the bride and the bride only. quite frankly, I felt disgusted looking at the dress again, I don't want it anymore. And so I think it's fair that she pays me after she ruined it for me. He yelled at me. and told me to wake up and stop treating his mom like that as if she was an enemy. We had a fight after he failed to get me to back down and he's been staying with his mom since then. I felt awful, but I spent 3k on this dress and worked hard .to get it, I can't stand looking at it but people in my family think I'm escalating things and risking my relationship with not only FMIL but my fiance as well. AITA? Update: Oh My God! This blew up, and so I thought I'd add some updates. My fiance called and offered to pay for the dress himself so we can end the conflict but he wants me to : * hand him my phone so he can delete the photo himself.* Swear that I don't have any copies to use against his mom later.* Apologize to his mom.* And lastly, He asked that I quit his family group chat and log out of facebook for at least a month. I haven't responded yet. P.s He called with this offer/conditions hours ago but I didn't want to include this in the post but now I did. Also, I'm not sure if I'll agree because I don't want him to pay for it, I want his mom, the one who wore it to pay for it. Not being vicious but trying to hold her accountable.",

        "selftext": "My husband and I live in the US northeast, where I am from. \u201cJohn\u201d moved here for work several years ago, from the deep south of the US where he grew up, raised with Christian holidays but never attending church. Coincidentally, shortly before everything hit, John\u2019s parents AND his childhood best friend \u201cDan\u201d and his wife decided to move here as well. This past weekend was the first that us three couples have gathered together since any of us moved here; we had a \u201cdistanced picnic\u201d at our house. John sat down 2-3 minutes after I did, as he was settling our kid into his pen in the yard with us. Dan and my FIL immediately started to \u201cjokingly\u201d rip on him for being \u201cwhipped\u201d and doing \u201cmy\u201d job of parenting our child while he was supposed to be \u201callowed\u201d to just catch up with the two other men. I was trying to politely deflect when it turned to how \u201cmean\u201d I was for not \u201cfixing him a plate\u201d and serving him  before serving myself. (If I thought a certain dish would run out before he got to it, or if he had asked me to, I of course would have!) Dan and FIL continued to brag about how their families do it right, where they handle the \u201coutside chores\u201d while their wives handle the \u201cinside chores\u201d (including the care of Dan and his wife\u2019s two children). I think it\u2019s important to note here that both currently live in rented condos that by their nature do not have \u201coutdoor chores\u201d, and **both their wives have always worked full time, as I do**. The whole day was kind of wrecked by that start, and I was frustrated when John left with Dan and FIL to \u201cgo for a walk\u201d and left me to do all the clean up alone while also looking after our kid. I expected John to apologize when he returned hours later, but instead HE got at ME for \u201cmaking [him] look bad\u201d in front of his friend and dad. He brought up how \u201ca traditional division of labor\u201d is \u201ca huge part of southern culture\u201d, and how I was being \u201cdisrespectful\u201d to his background by \u201cforcing northern culture\u201d onto him and his family. He said he\u2019s been building up a lot of \u201cresentment\u201d the past few months that I \u201cmake\u201d him do half the chores and childcare, since in his \u201cculture\u201d, women do the chores and hands-on childcare, and men do the fun parenting, the discipline, mow the grass, and bring in the cars for oil changes when needed. I was stunned but honest and told him southern culture is garbage. It's bigotry. I lived in John's home state for 8 years, and I saw how southern hospitality is reserved only for those in your in-group. Deviate from the norm--be queer, non-Christian, a POC, a liberal, a non-traditional woman--and they turn on you viciously. Does every single person act like that always? No. But it's the culture.  John is livid and says his culture is just as valid as that of other global regions, religions, and ethnic groups, so I am the bigot by not compromising with him here and incorporating aspects of his culture into our family life the way I would if his culture was Islamic or Asian or whatnot.",

It sucks because there's so much our there about us and it's what's gonna come up when I'm looking for a job, when I'm dating, when anyone looks up my name. I found a website that will print custom jackets, print all over the front and back and arms... And I ordered some hoodies that say a bunch of phrases all over them. No photos no videos i do not consent to be photographed no means no respect my privacy no cameras no profiting off my image It sounds silly but it looks pretty sick actually. I got one for me and one for my nine year old sister who's started to not always want photos. And I guess the idea is that my mom can't take good looking pictures, even candid ones, with us in the hoodies without them having a pretty strong message that we don't want to be in pictures. My mom was mad when they showed up, and really mad when I'm wearing mine. Like she says she just wants pictures to remember my young years by, she won't post ones without asking But I know that's a whole mess anyway; she always says that and then negotiates me into letting her post, like either by saying that's how she makes income so if I want money for something, to stop arguing about pictures. Or posting without asking and then saying I thought it would be ok because you're face wasn't visible / you're just in the background, etc. And I'm always like no you didn't THINK. if you thought at all you'd remember what I said I want. No new pictures of me or mentions of me online. Remove all pictures that include me that you've ever posted. and delete any writing that mentions me.  I am just so fed up, and upset that my mom is mad at me for wearing my new hoodie everyday. She's mad I won't take it off for any event and thinks it's inappropriate to wear to certian things. I know it's really weird looking but it feels like my only option. Edit to add a couple more things... She also says all the mentions of consent and no means no and this body is my own (sorry forgot to mention that one earlier) imply something more inappropriate and that it is really inappropriate to wear those words out in public. We've also fought about me wearing it to family events and school events with a generally dressier dress code, because it looks like a gangster hoody.

But as of now, he hasn't moved much stuff in, right now 95% of the stuff and furniture in the house is mine.  When his mom comes over, she's kind of a snoop. He was used to that, but when she comes to our house, it's so uncomfortable because she's just going through my shit.  When I am bothered, she's like I was just helping with chores etc. He says I should just let her because she has a lot of nervous energy  One thing she snooped on was actually embarrassing. In my home office, I had a little affirmation post it note on my monitor saying I am smart, I am skilled, I am deserving of great things It was a silly thing my therapist recommended to get me in a confident mindset before an interview.  Anyway, she made a comment to about my ego...  But as a joke, I decided to do it again. I had my best friend over and we got wine drunk and wrote a bunch of affirmations to hide. Some were: Medicine cabinet: My teeth will regrow! I am sharklike and powerful! Kitchen drawers: I know when to spoon, but I also know when to fork! I am sexy and self assured! Work desk: I will not just fuck my way to the top of the company, I will fuck my way to the top of the world!  Walk in closet: I am beautiful with clothes and without! Especially without! My boobs are legendary! There were a bunch more, and my friend and I had a hilarious time writing them.  Next time my MIL came over she saw a few. And she didn't acknowledge them to me even though she definitely started acting a little weird about me.  I went to run some errands and when I was out, she confronted Al about the notes and was trying to tell him that I seemed unstable, egotistical, and moving in was a bad idea. She showed him the notes and he didn't really know what to make of it.  He asked me and I said that they were just some silly private notes to boost my self confidence and make myself laugh; how had she gotten them? Had she been going through my things?  He said she was just tidying, and saw them. And they were real weird. I was like 'have you met me? You should know how weird I am. Anyway if you don't want your mom seeing my weird shit you've got to stop letting her go through my shit He asked if I left them on purpose to annoy her, and I admitted that was kinda the joke, but I also have other weird or private shit so what I said about her needing to stop snooping if she didn't want to find weird crap was still for real. He said I was making stuff hard for him, his mom was really protective and adjusting to him moving in with a girlfriend for the first time, and I was agitating her on purpose and making her think I wouldn't be a good partner, when he wanted her to have the opposite impression of me!

We got engaged when I was 20 and about 6 months after we found out we were expecting. Unfortunately I miscarried a couple days later. That was the worst moment of our lives.  We always dreamed about starting a family early so this was a major blow to us individually and to our relationship. I fell into deep depression and I admit I was wrong for only caring for the lost i felt and not my partner\u2019s. We argued a lot, he partially blamed me and I accused him of not knowing how it felt to lose a life you were growing inside you.  We were hurting each other and decided to separate for a while, that while turned into a year. We still kept in contact, I went to therapy and worked on healing myself, he even came to a few sessions with me.  We decided to get back together shortly after my 23rd birthday. However the relationship wasn\u2019t the same. He was somewhat withdrawn from me and I thought it was because he still blamed me. I was sick overthinking and worrying. It got to the point where i was going backwards in my process so i decided to snoop through his phone. I found out during the year we separated he had been confiding in my sister (27) and it turned to something intimate. He cut it off when we got back together but the damage was done. She was pregnant.  Turns out my parents knew about this and some of our friends. I kicked him out and cut off everybody who knew. Well a couple weeks ago I got an invite to the wedding. Something snapped inside of me, I got drunk and I took a cab to my parents house where they were throwing a party for them. Most of my family was there, I basically showed up and gave a whole fuck you speech to everybody. My sister ran upstairs in tears and my parents called me an a hole for ruining the prospect of their wedding. I said good because nobody apologized to me, everybody just kept saying we were separated, things happen people fall in love, i should be happy for them, the heart wants what i wants. The worst part is my sister told me maybe my baby died for a reason so she could get her happy ending.  I\u2019m regretting getting drunk now because i\u2019m not a confrontation person but i was so upset. Aita ? Hi everybody, thanks for all the support and encouraging words so far. I know this update is coming so soon but i\u2019ll like to tell you guys a joke. My sister called from an unknown number a couple minutes after i posted this lol (I\u2019ve blocked everyone). She asked well more demanded that I return the ring fianc\u00e9 bought since it would be disrespectful to keep anything for him knowing they\u2019re starting a family. She said how immature of me for basically not sucking it up and being happy for her. She even intended to make me her MoH. I apologized to her for ruining her party and told her I\u2019d mail the ring but as for me and her, we\u2019re done and to tell my parents the same. I\u2019m here balling my eyes out waiting on my therapist to finish with another patient so i don\u2019t turn to a bottle again and go off again.",

I\u2019ve been able to have a good relationship with my daughter and I enjoy my time with her, but there\u2019s one thing about her that would give many people pause - she is a diagnosed sociopath. She exhibited odd, disturbing behavior at a young age, and after a serious incident of abuse towards her younger sister, I realized she needed professional help. Throughout her elementary years she struggled heavily, getting in lots of trouble in school for lying, cruelty and all other types of misbehaviors. With an enormous amount of therapy & support, her bad behavior was minimized as she grew older. She received an ASPD diagnosis at 18, and I had suspected it for long prior. After her aggressive behavior was tamed, her following years were much more fruitful. She\u2019s law-abiding; has a decent job and a good education; and has many good friendships and admirers. Especially male admirers; she is very, very charming and adept at attracting guys and maintaining their interest. She uses that old dating guide \u201cThe Rules\u201d like a Bible. She currently has a boyfriend of about a year and a half who\u2019s crazy about her, and who I have a very strong relationship with (we live in the same area and spend time together regularly). He is a **great** guy, very kind, funny and intelligent. But I doubt she loves him. We\u2019ve had some very honest, in-depth discussions about her mental health since her diagnosis, and she\u2019s been open with me that she doesn\u2019t feel love or empathy towards anyone, even family. When she acted very sad and broken up over the death of one of her closest friends at the funeral, she confessed to me privately that it was all a put-on, and that she felt \u201cpretty neutral\u201d about the whole thing. She has also stated she has never once felt guilty about anything she\u2019s ever done, and doesn\u2019t know what guilt feels like. While she enjoys being around her boyfriend and is sexually attracted to him, I highly doubt she feels much of anything towards him love-wise. Her boyfriend (who might propose soon) **has** **no idea** about her diagnosis, and she\u2019s been very upfront with me that she has no plans to ever tell him, thinking it\u2019ll scare him away. I\u2019ve made it clear to her that she needs to tell him the truth before they marry; that he has the right to know and consider it; **or I will**; to which she always responds, \u201cI know you wouldn\u2019t dare.\u201d I actually would - I really like and respect this young man, and would feel awful keeping this \u201csecret\u201d from him, and letting him walk into a marriage without this piece of knowledge. I\u2019m not trying to sabotage my daughter\u2019s future. **Maybe** her boyfriend\u2019s love of her personality and other aspects is enough that it won\u2019t end the relationship. It\u2019s his decision to make; but he deserves all the facts. Someday he\u2019s bound to find out she\u2019s a bit \u201coff\u201d; it can\u2019t be kept a secret forever. AITA?",

        "selftext": "My (39M) son (17M) Bryce dated our neighbor Lana (17F) for a year, they broke up mid Jan for reasons I don't know. I won't sugarcoat this, I never liked Lana, she always seem a little unhinged, controlling and aggressive, she's always demanding Bryce's attention and there were quite a few times when she showed up on our house our of nowhere (whether it was 7am or 11pm) because Bryce wasn't answering his phone, screaming and calling him a cheater when it wasn't like that. The thought of our son getting abused by his gf made us worried so much. My wife and I tried to talk him out of that relationship, we said how that it wasn't normal nor healthy, we didn't want to force the break up because we feared Lana would lash out to him so we tried to do it in an sneaky way, we don't know if it worked but they ended up breaking up.  He said that after he broke up with her Lana didn't contacted him which was weird because he expected her to go nuts but I told him that if fate didn't gave him shit he better not tease it. Now the problem is that we bought my son a car for Christmas, nothing fancy but enough to get him to school, his job and eventually college, he parks it in our driveway outside our home. Ever since the month began we had been founding scratches all over the car, we know Lana was doing it but since it was minimal my son decided to not do anything even if we could prove that it was her (we've CCTV). Still, something smell bad for me so I decided to switch one of the cameras facing his car directly just in case.  Well, two weeks ago we got up and we found my son's car covered in a lot of shit: paint, glue, feathers, confetti, the door handles were wrecked, flat tires, paint all over the windows, you get the picture, Bryce and my wife were so distraught. We called the police and I handled them the CCTV that showed Lana and her brother (23M) destroying my son's car. We pressed charges and needles to say, Lana's brother went straight to jail, but since she's still a minor her parents want to make a deal but I refused. I don't think she should get a way out, before the police was here she was laughing her ass off and she tried to play it cool, if she thought this was funny then she's old enough to face the consequences. My wife and I want to stand our ground, they said they'll buy my son a better car and put Lana on therapy but is not enough. AITA?",

        "selftext": "I 23 am the oldest of five siblings and I am a full time student. I also have a part time job in my field but when I complete my after degree  my employer will take me on full time.  I make enough from part time to pay for school and put money aside. My siblings range from 20-10.   Both of our parents work full time. I have taken on a lot of the responsibilities for keeping everything running in the house.  I do the grocery shopping, the laundry as well as making suppers and doing meal prep so everyone has lunches ready to take every day. I also get all my siblings to do their part with regards to household chores.  For example my youngest brother is responsible for feeding and walking the dogs.  So I make sure that there is dog food in the storage and poop bags on the leash.   My dad works very long hours and my mom works 9-5 at a hard job.   Over Christmas I had a chance to buy a PS5 for myself so I did.  The rest of my family is still using a shared PS4.  I keep mine in my room and I do not share.   My parents started fielding complaints from my oldest brother about how I made so much money and I don't share the things I buy for myself.  Totally true.  So they had a talk with me where they brought this up.  I pointed out how much of the household work I did and they said it wasn't fair that o was earning so much money without contributing. They told me how much they expected from me.   I went to my room and did the math.  If I gave them what they wanted I would have about $800 a month left over.  If I dropped a couple of classes next semester I could go to almost full time hours with my employer and and it would only be one more year until I graduated with my second degree.  But I could afford my own place and I would have way more free time and disposable income.   I packed up and moved out. Everything I owned fit in my car.  I stayed at an Airbnb for two weeks until I could get everything sorted with an apartment, school, and work.  It was great.   I'm not going to lie I may have gone a little overboard on Tinder.  I couldn't have women over to my parents house.   I just moved into my own apartment.  I'm staying part time until I finish this semester.  I will work full time over the summer and go to a lighter class load/higher work hours in the fall.   My oldest brother has been tasked by my parents to do everything I used to do.  His chores have been split up with the other three.  They are all pissed at me for moving out.   My parents are upset that I left them in the lurch.  My siblings are mad that they all have more chores.  My oldest brother is especially salty because he has no free time to see his girlfriend and she isn't allowed in the house when my parents aren't home.   I'm enjoying my free time.  I bought myself a plant from IKEA.     I feel bad for screwing them all over but it didn't make sense for me to do all that work and pay rent on top. #EDIT All the chores were split fairly.  I wasn't doing any more than anyone else.  I thought it was fair until I was asked to out in money as well.",

        "selftext": "(No names in this story are real.) For some context before the story, I (38f) cook asian foods regularly for dinner and for my daughter, Lily\u2019s (7f) lunches at school. This is because my family enjoys these foods, I like to cook these foods, and my mom cooked a bunch of these foods growing up since she\u2019s half Japanese. Often times I\u2019ll either give my daughter some leftovers from last nights dinner, plus a fruit/veggie and a snack, or I\u2019ll make her a quick little bento box or some other thing really quick. So, after school one day, my daughter wanted to play on the playground for a bit before we went home. I said she could play for a few minutes, and she ran off to play. I was waiting next to this other parent, who we\u2019ll call Debra. While I was waiting, Debra came up to me. Debra: Are you Lily\u2019s mother? Me: Oh, yeah, I am, why? Debra: Well, your daughter\u2019s lunches have been bothering my son, and I would like to ask you to pack something else. Me: What? How are they bothering him? She then proceeded to start talking about how her son was complaining about my daughters lunches smelling terrible, and that he thought it was disgusting. She also said her son didn\u2019t eat most of his lunch because he was so grossed out. Me: Okay\u2026I understand your son doesn\u2019t like the smell, but can\u2019t he just sit somewhere else? Debra: Are you kidding me? My son shouldn\u2019t have to put up with whatever crap you make your daughter bring to this school. It\u2019s disgusting! And she started making more vaguely racist complaints, but I was fed up at this point. Me: Listen, I understand your son might not like my daughters food, but he can very easily just not sit next to her. I\u2019m not changing what\u2019s in my daughters lunches because you and your kid don\u2019t want to exist near Asian food. Fuck off. She angrily stomped off with her kid then, and my daughter finished playing soon after, so we went home. I talked to my husband about it, and he said that maybe I shouldn\u2019t have told her to fuck off, to avoid her bothering us in the future. AITA?",

I married his step mom who is a mother of two boys 'Connor',20 (deceased) and 'Derek',12. I've never had the pleasure to meet Connor who tragically passed away from a motorcycle accident. Derek was so devastated by this loss and although it's been years he's still pretty much grieving.  I've seen tons of pictures and videos of Connor and made efforts to get to know who he was as a way to share Derek's grief and be there for him to lend an ear and a comforting shoulder. It's safe to say that Derek and I grew a strong bond in no time. But my son Leo isn't close to Derek. Understandable because not all siblings and step siblings are the same. Leo and Derek are different in everything which isn't a bad thing but Leo calls himself the brutally honest type and makes insensitive comments about Derek most of the time. they tend to be under the guise of 'Advice'. Derek never complained so I had to step in and tell Leo to stop being insensitive towards his stepbrother especially, with everything regarding Conner and his memory. Leo would say OK I get it and I won't do it again. Days ago, Leo wanted to hang out with friends and asked Derek if he wanted to join. Derek agreed and put on Connor's hoodie before going out. Leo commented on the hoodie and called it ugly and asked him to put on something else but Derek insisted on wearing it or not go. Leo dropped it. Hours later Derek came home crying with his hoodie in hand. He said Leo and friends cut it into pieces while he was in the bathroom after they convinced him to take it off. I was furious I asked Leo and he said it was his friend's idea then said he had to do it since Derek wears it everywhere and it looked old and embarrassing. I reminded him who this hoodie belonged to and he said so what, maybe this will help him move on in life. I told him his birthday was cancelled and his friends aren't welcome anymore.He pitched a fit saying his birthday was a right not a privilege and I can't cancel it. He had my ex criticize my decision and wanted to host his birthday party but I refused because he's grounded so no party anywhere. She and her family called me awful and ridiculous and asked me to think how Leo will hate me for this but I insisted he needed punishment for putting his stepbrother through this. Note: the hoodie belonged to Conner when he was younger and Derek kept it.",

I used and used until I was basically in poverty and my older sister helped bail me out more than once.  She\u2019s my best friend and I know it hurt her a lot to see me like that.  She also met her fianc\u00e9 two years ago and he really only knew me as the junkie brother then. He\u2019s not my biggest fan to say the least considering how much I put my sister through.  Despite this she still invited me to her wedding last week because I am her brother and she wanted me to be there.  When I get to the reception, my brother in law is greeting people as they walk in.  When I walk by he pulls me to the side and in front of everyone starts patting me down and says that he needs to check me to make sure I \u201cdidn\u2019t bring anything in\u201d.  I instinctively pull away, because why wouldn\u2019t I, and I tell him not to touch me.  He tells me to \u201ccalm down\u201d and that if I want to be here then he needs to do this. I tell him he\u2019s being ridiculous and I try to push past him. He stops me and tells me that he doesn\u2019t want to throw me out but he \u201cwill if he has to.\u201d I told him that he\u2019s trying to look tough but it\u2019s just making him look stupid.

        "selftext": "My graduation ceremony is being held next week. My dad had given me some money in advance to pay for the party. I live mostly with my mom but they were supposed to be hosting the event together. Dad and I have a rocky relationship. After my parents divorced when I was 4 they split custody of me and he was able to stay a good dad. When I was 10 he met Jane. Jane had three kids, twins and a single kid. They got married when I was 12 but I would say even before that I felt like he prioritized her kids over me a lot. He would cancel plans with me if they wanted to do something and would either do the thing with them or force me to go and say it was even better than our plans, when for me it wasn't. Think going for a hike with me vs taking them to an indoor play area. Or seeing a movie with me vs the kiddie park. One more example is when I was given a ticket for a concert my dad and I both love. He was supposed to buy a ticket to come with me for some father/son time, but actually spent it on his youngest stepkid who wanted their room painted. He told me at the last minute and it hurt. There are other times stuff like this happened. He didn't show up at the hospital when I broke my arm because one stepkid was getting their tonsils out and wanted both him and his wife there. He told my mom over the phone to tell me he was proud of me for being brave and understanding, even though I never said that shit. When I would bring this stuff up to him he'd tell me it was natural to feel jealous of sharing his attention. That was all he would say. In 2019 he told my mom he would split the cost of a trip I wanted to go on with one of my clubs, because she didn't have the money all by herself. Mom had her half saved. We told my dad he needed to pay. He said bills were tight and it was the twins birthdays and the money needed to go on something for them. He told me we could do something as a family when the trip happened instead. I told him to forget it. That he was making it clear who was more important and I was going to stay with my mom where I actually mattered. Mom borrowed money to cover the other half of the trip. Dad told me he regretted making me feel less important and we were working on things and then the graduation money was given about a month ago. Then a week ago he called and told me how one of the stepkids was being bullied, how bad of a time they're having it, and with that money they could help cheer them up for their birthday. I was pissed. I hung up. Then two days later I showed up at his doorstep, gave him the money and told him I didn't want to see him or his new family at my graduation, and that he had chosen who was more important so he better stay out of my life. His stepkids and two younger bio kids were there.  I didn't stick around. He called and told me we needed to talk it out like adults, and that I had hurt the kids feelings. His wife freaked out on me so I blocked her. AITA?",

I got a lot of nice replies and awards and i am very thankful for all of the support i have been getting. I'm having my daughter come home from school with her grandma instead of the daycare. I emailed the owner of the daycare franchise (not the manager) and they are very furious and have decided to let go the people who were participating in this. I am not going to report them yet unless they do this again and i am in a group chat with the parents and i told them to all tell me if they do this to their kids again and i am afraid that reporting the place could make a lot of the people who didn't know about this lose their jobs. Turns out the manager and her friends were just power tripping. I am not very confrontational and my husband also said reporting would not be a good idea since if they close down other parents would lose childcare.** A while ago my daughter[8f] was complaining about her daycare because they were not giving her sunscreen. she asked for sunscreen but they said that black people do not need sunscreen but they actually do. before covid they went on a field trip and they made all the black kids sit in the sun and made the white kids sit in the shade because it would damage their skin or some bs. i talked to the ladies at the daycare and they said that it was justified but said if we brought in a doctors note they would give her sunscreen. i made my daughter take it to school and let her share it with other kids but then the teacher took it saying she was not allowed to do that without permission. The other day she came home with a bad sunburn and her skin was peeling and i had enough and wrote that they were racist and segregating kids and that she could get skin cancer because they are forcing her in the sun without sunscreen. i sent the lady in charge articles about cancer and that black people can get sunburned and sent her names of the workers who enforced this. she said that they were under her orders and that she was right because we have more protection against this and said that i was blowing this out of proportion and asked me to take my review down. I am seriously thinking of contacting a news channel about this. my friend said i am being a karen for complaining publicly and that black people have melanin so that gives them lots of protection that other kids dont have EDIT: we live in the deep south",

She no longer meets friends nor welcomes them at our home nor even meet family on person. It's been bad to say the least but her stepbrother (18) Ben has been making it worse with his nagging comments and jokes about her looks. He tried taking and posting pics of her secretly to share but I shut that down even though my husband thought it was just harmless teasing. My husband's sister's wedding was last week. The family wanted Megan yo go but she didn't want to. I spent so much time trying to help her and convince her to start socializing again and see family. She agreed under the condition that I let her wear a wig which I agreed, not only that but I took her shopping to pick her own wig and she looked beautifully stunning in her pixie hairstyle wig. My husband and Ben laughed when they saw it. I don't know why.  We went to the wedding and everything was going well til this happened. We were all sitting and we started talking about Meghan look, suddenly Ben reached out and pulled her wig and exposed her head. I was shocked I froze but Megan yelled then took her wig and ran. Ben, his cousins and some guests started laughing. I was upset especially when looked over my shoulder and saw my husband sitting next to his mom and laughing. I lost it on Ben and berated him infront of everyone then took my stuff, got Megan and got into the car and went home. Ben and my husband didn't have a ride home and my husband kept calling me but I didn't respond. He came home asking about me leaving mid wedding and upsetting his sister and then leaving him and Ben with no rude home. I argued with him about how Ben embarrassed Megan and humiliated her publicly which must've ruined what's left of her self esteem. He said that it was just kids teasing each other and that I overreacted and Ben had no malicious intent he was just messing with her. I said I was sick of it but he said that this is their way of bonding as stepsiblings and I was getting inthe way of it and being overprotective and unreasonable. We didn't talk after that and Ben is refusing to apologize and his dad is backing him up.",

        "selftext": "This year I went to my fianc\u00e9\u2019s house for Christmas. It was my first time going, as we would typically go to my family\u2019s house instead.  I got a (rather pricey) gift for my fianc\u00e9 \u201cDan\u201d related to his hobbies, I got nice gifts for \u201cDan\u2019s\u201d parents based off of things I\u2019d talked about with them before, and I got a small pack of chocolates for each of Dan\u2019s other relatives (I didn\u2019t know them that well).  I wasn\u2019t expecting many gifts from Dan\u2019s relative\u2019s because I didn\u2019t know many of them that well, but I was certainly expecting more than I got.  At first, I was excited when I saw that there was a big pile of gifts for me. However, once I opened the first one it was just a piece of coal. Everyone laughed, and I just kind of laughed along thinking it was a gag gift and that the other gifts would be different. But every single one turned out to be coal. All 18 of them.  I started to get upset, so I cried and lashed out at Dan. But he calmly explained apparently this is a longstanding tradition in his family where they gift coal to newcomers who are celebrating Christmas with them for the first time. He explained that it\u2019s just easier that way since all the relatives who might not know the newcomer well don\u2019t have to stress over finding a gift, and it\u2019s a fun experience for the newcomer as well.  I told Dan I couldn\u2019t believe I skipped my own family\u2019s celebration for this and left. But now Dan and some of his family are blowing up my phone saying I embarrassed him in front of his relatives and that I made it awkward for everyone. So aita?",

According to my son, the other day my 4-year-old granddaughter (his niece) pulled down the TV and broke it. My son told us that he took the TV to the dump as it was shattered and useless. My daughter and son-in-law (my 4yo granddaughters parents) felt very bad for what had happened and paid the cost of the TV that day. My husband was watching our security cameras and our son's story doesn't hold up. We never see our granddaughter breaking the TV. All that we see is our son taking away the TV that is not shattered. We asked our son about this and he said that the security camera must have cut out the part that shows our granddaughter breaking the TV. Eventually I got a call from my son's girlfriend that lives with him. She said that she knew what was going on and felt guilty. She basically told us that our son had made up the story about the TV breaking and stole it and took it to their house to watch.  I filed a police report and his girlfriend let the police into their house to get us our TV back. We do plan on pressing charges against him. He stole our TV and made my daughter pay for it. That is messed up on so many levels. AITA for pressing charges?",

        "selftext": "My dad practically gave me up to his sister from the moment I (27M) was born. My mom died when she was giving birth to me. And my aunt told me he never recovered from that because he blamed me for her dying.  It hurt a lot as a kid that at family events he would ignore my existence. When I was a little older he got more vocal about me \u201ckilling\u201d her and he can\u2019t stand to look at my face.  You can imagine the amount of therapy that put me in. I used to go to church crying because I was scared about going to hell for doing that to my mom. That\u2019s how much his words fucked me up. But the shitty part was that I never stopped trying to be accepted by him. After my highschool graduation he told me to never bother him again since he legally has no obligation to me anymore (since he was sending my aunt money to take care of me). Around that time is when I finally started accepting that reality so from there we moved on with our lives.  My aunt doesn\u2019t talk to me about him. Sometimes my grandparents do and that\u2019s how I found out he got married. They were mad he didn\u2019t invite me to their wedding but to me it didn\u2019t matter because we\u2019re not close. But it was his wife who wanted to meet me. It\u2019s the first time ever that he wants to make contact and it was to pretty much say she wants me on their life. She doesn\u2019t know the real reason about why we\u2019re estranged, he asked me to please not say anything and maybe this could be a way to reconcile after all.  But he was only doing it for her. That much was clear when we talked. I never said I would be he still insisted on us meeting at their place because she really wanted to meet me. All she thinks is we were estranged for not getting along in my teenager years, going to college and losing touch because of \u201clife stuff.\u201d It pissed me off that he played it off as us just not talking for petty reasons meanwhile the actually reason damaged me for years.  I told her the truth. Everything he said to me. That he was never a parent to me, that was all my aunt. It was definitely a shock for her. The outcome was a disaster. Everyone has heard about this now. My grandma\u2019s in particular told me she understands my anger. But this was his chance finding someone since losing my mom and now it\u2019s been put in jeopardy.  My dad is devastated. They think it was going too far to ruin his marriage that way when he was willing to include me in their lives which could have been the start of our relationship. And they say not only did I ruin that but also possibly wrecked his marriage. She just doesn\u2019t agree at all with what he did and it could\u2019ve been avoided if I didn\u2019t say anything.  For me it was hard not to tell the truth after the lies made it seem like it was nothing serious. I couldn\u2019t ignore what happened after what it did. Idk if it was the right call since it put their whole marriage at risk after all.",

        "selftext": "Okay this is a doozy, so please strap in and bear with me. For context here, my sister is 30, I am 22.  Ten years ago, my sister had a miscarriage. Obviously, it was devastating for her and the whole family and it took her a couple of years to fully heal from it. We're still not 100% sure why it happened, but it was a one off and she's since had three very healthy, beautiful children, including a set of twins.  So here's the thing. My sister and I don't really get on. She resented me as a kid because she had to share mum's attention and because she thought mum left her dad to be with mine. Never really grew out of that resentment and she was pretty much my biggest bully throughout childhood and my teenage years. One thing she absolutely cannot stand is when  mum and I do things without her, or when mum pays more attention to me than to her. When this happens she calls mum and says she's feeling really upset about the miscarriage and without fail mum goes running. This includes a trip to Paris I took mum on for her birthday earlier this year, which she cut short because sister said she needed her. Also includes when I had a manic episode so bad I was hospitalised and sister managed to need mum every time she was planning to visit me and so she never did. Note, these times when mum is spending more time with me than her are the only times sister brings up what happened and certainly the only times she still gets so upset about it.  So recently I was sick. Like, don't leave the bathroom for days, can only keep water down sick. Didn't manage to get the doctor, but I think it was norovirus. It lasted about a week Mum was popping in daily on her way home from work to check on me and stuff. On the last day of being seriously unwell, when I felt I could eat again, Mum offered to make me some soup while she was there, which I accepted. She was halfway through making it when sister called her saying she was upset about the miscarriage and she told me I'd have to finish it myself because she had to go. I didn't say anything to Mum and I finished making the soup, but I sent my sister a text saying she really needs to stop bringing it up for attention because she can't bear me getting some instead. I guess she told mum and her dad because I'm hearing from all sides what a horrible, insensitive, selfish bastard I am and how dare I say that to her. I understand she may still be traumatised, I just think it's really weird how that trauma solely manifests whenever I'm getting attention and she isn't. AITA?",

        "selftext": "UPDATED!  Throwaway account because she uses reddit. My (M25) girlfriend (F30) Nat has a very particular sense of style. Picture Harley Finkle from wizards of waverly place, you will get the idea. Don\u2019t get me wrong, i never had a problem with that! In fact, i love the way she dresses because she loves to do so, and i am happy if she is happy. The thing is, sometimes she likes to incorporate memes into her clothes. No problem. It\u2019s cute. But now she wants to wear a dress inspired on the meme \u201cgay rat wedding\u201d. To my friend\u2019s wedding. He and his fianc\u00e9 are gay. I told her, maybe that is not really appropriated? The dress in question would be full of little stuffed rats, pride flags and a big \u201cI SUPPORT GAY RATS\u201d on the front. My friend is not a big fan of the way my GF dresses and i think this dress may cause an certain uproar in the wedding. Now, nat is upset with me and claiming that i am \u201cthrowing water in her flame of creativity\u201d. The wedding is next month, so she has plenty of time to think about another thing to wear. Should i just let her go with the dress? Am i the asshole in this situation?   UPDATE: well guys, as many of you pointed out in the comments, me getting a throwaway account didn\u2019t help. She found the post. Guess i was too specific after all. I will update soon  FINAL UPDATE: Hello everyone! I would like to thank you all for your judgment, advices and opinions on my post, it was greatly appreciated! So\u2026 the conversation did not go well. She was livid with me for exposing her in this way, and although i showed her the comments (most important, the ones from the LGBTQIA community) she refused to admit that her dress was a poor choice, but in fact, her way to \u201cappreciate the gays\u201d. That did not sit well with me. Love can move mountains, but can NOT maintain a relationship with a homophobic. So, now i am going to the wedding a single, rat-free-dress, man! I did reach out to my friend and send him this post. He thought the situation to be hilarious, but if she did show up in the dress, he would def kick us to the curb. I guess this is all! Ps: i am deeply sorry for misspelling harpey\u2019s name, won\u2019t happen again lol",

        "selftext": "I'm 29F. When I was about 10, my mom married my step father. I have an older brother Luke who was 15. My step father had Amy and Ada who were 12 and 11. We didn't come from a privileged background, my mum was a min wage worker and my dad was absent. Our step father had a very good income. Their deal was that they wouldn't combine finances, and they would each contribute equally to the household, and then each takes care of their children with their spare money. So my mum never had anything for us, and my step father was spending big on his kids. This included holidays which Luke and I were excluded from (step father would pay for mum, but not us). Luke and I also shared a room even though Amy and Ada had their own rooms and we had a guest room, because step father insisted that he was paying more towards the house so my mum's share would only get her one room for the kids. Luke and I were constantly teased for this situation by the three of them as we grew up. My mum always said that we should be thankful because if it wasn't for our step father we would not be living in a nice home in a good neighborhood.  Anyway, Luke and I became determined to be able to take care of ourselves so that we wouldn't need to take nonsense from anyone. We have both done quite well with our careers and finances and we are in a very good place. Since turning 18 and moving out my relationship with the three of them has been very limited. I wouldn't call us friends, but we can exist peacefully if we are in the same place. I visited my mum recently and my step father mentioned that Amy wants to buy a house now that she's pregnant. He asked me if I'm able to help out a little with the deposit. The house is \u00a3500k and she needs a \u00a3150k deposit. She has \u00a3100k so far. \u00a325k on her own, \u00a325k from her mum and \u00a350k from step father. He was asking if Luke and I can help cover the extra \u00a350k and he said he'd pay us back as part of the inheritance eventually. I said no. He insisted that Luke and I both own our houses outright and with our incomes so we should be able to help. I said whether I can or not is irrelevant, my answer is no. He reminded me that Luke and I each gave \u00a310k to our cousin for buying a house as a gift, Amy is my sister and he's offering to pay us back. I said that was our choice then, this is my choice now. He insisted that we should be willing to help out our family if we're able to, I replied back like how you helped me and Luke when we were kids? Everyone just went quiet when I said this. After a while, he said if we went back in time he'd have done things differently, treated all four of us equally. I said that's good of you but doesn't make you entitled to my money now. He said he knows he's not entitled, that's why he's asking and promising to pay it back, I said the answer still is no, not entitled to a loan either. My mum later told me I could have turned him down without being an asshole or bringing up childhood which he already feels guilty about. AITA?",

        "selftext": "I'm a single mom in my 50s with one daughter. I got very lucky in that I bought a home in the Bay Area nearly 30 years ago for around $230K before the tech boom and now the house is worth about $1M.  I have a 23 year old daughter Camila who grew up in that house and she moved out last year to go live with her boyfriend. I've never explicitly told my daughter the house will be yours nor has she asked anything about it, but just sort of common sense - that's my daughter. Who else would I give it to? One important note - There are 2 homes in the neighborhood that are owned by lower middle class people (me and a neighbor who's been here as long as I have). Otherwise, our neighbors are engineers and software developers. The Bay Area is simply un-affordable if you're not in tech. My daughter is a hair stylist. My fiance Steven and I have been together for 2 years. He has 2 young children (elementary school) he has joint custody of who I adore and I'm excited to help raise them. Steven and I don't have a ton in the bank so a pre-nup seemed silly if it weren't for the house. I told him that I'm ready to combine finances and plan long term with him, but I wanted a pre-nup agreement just for the house. It's a non-negotiable for me that my daughter inherits the house. He wasn't happy with this. He said that $1M split 3 ways is enough for all 3 kids to get a headstart in life. I disagree, I paid 80% of the mortgage by myself and Camila is my only child. She can have her dream life (working as a hair stylist, living in the Bay Area) with this house but will be unhappy (have to move out to a less desirable area) if it's split.  I spoke to Camila about this and she agrees that she should get the house and said she always planned on inheriting it, just like I always planned on giving it to her.",

        "selftext": "My sister and I have always had a strained relationship. I usually just let things go and try to keep the piece. We both have sons who are around the same age. My nephew is 13 and my son just turned 11. For my sons birthday I bought him the new gaming system he has been wanting. He was absolutely thrilled and he plays nonstop.  My sister is bad with money. I usually have to lend her money for bills and stuff for my nephew. I know my nephew doesn\u2019t always get the best Christmas gifts so this year I went a little crazy and I purchased the same gaming system for him for Christmas. I already had it ready and wrapped under my tree. Yesterday my sisters family came to visit. My son asked me if they could go play video games. I said yes and reminded them to be careful. About 30 minutes later my son comes running to me crying. I asked him what was wrong and he led me to the front hall. When we get to the stairs I see the new system smashed on the floor. Someone had thrown it from the upstairs and it was now smashed to pieces. I asked my son what happened and he sobbed and pointed at his cousin. I asked my nephew if he did this and he started to laugh. He said that it was a \u201cstupid baby toy\u201d and that he saw people break them online.  My sister came in and I told her what happened. I explained that this was an expensive system and that her son needs to be disaplined for what he did. I told her I wanted her to pay for what her son broke. She laughed and said no. She says I shouldn\u2019t have let them play unsupervised. That it was my fault and that I am a bad parent. She said my son will get over it and that it was not important.  Seeing my son sitting on the ground next to his broken system trying to put the pieces back together tore my heart out. I walked over to the Christmas tree and grabbed the system that was meant for my nephew. I pulled the gift wrap off and it gave it to son and told him to go upstairs and set it up. My sister asked me why I was making such a big deal when I had another one already. I than laughed and told her that was her sons Christmas gift. That since it wasn\u2019t important and it was just a stupid baby toy than they obviously won\u2019t miss it. I than told them to leave. My nephew realized what happened and began to cry that my son had stole his system. I said no his was the one that he smashed. My sister was livid and told me that I will never see them again. I just said okay and slammed the door. Other family members have now been calling me nonstop and saying I am an asshole and that I ruined my nephews Christmas. I don\u2019t think so though. My nephew is 13. He is not a stupid kid and he knew what he was doing. I don\u2019t care that it was over jealousy, he is old enough to know better. My sister was not going to make the situation right so I just did what I had to do. They all think I should buy another new system for him but I don\u2019t have that kind of money. I\u2019m starting to feel bad about this and I am wondering AITA?",

We got married in the fall of 2018, so it\u2019s been almost 4 years. We now live in Vermont. My whole family is from a small town in Texas, a super conservative Catholic area. I was raised there, but dad got a job in NYC when I was 15. The culture shock was difficult. We went from living in rural Texas to living in an apartment in Manhattan. My parents didn\u2019t sell our house in TX, they allowed our aunt & uncle who just had their 3rd child to move in while charging them a small rent. In college when I came out as bi, my brother and dad were very supportive. My mom needed some time to accept. The rest of my family reacted poorly at first but came around.  During visits we stayed with my aunt and uncle at my old house, but because we weren\u2019t married we weren\u2019t allowed to share a bed. We didn\u2019t argue, we both would rather make peace. Visiting since, instead of staying with my aunt & uncle we would rent a motel room. During Covid we did not visit them. But this summer, my parents and bro decided to go visit my hometown again for 2 weeks, & invited my husband and I. I wanted a motel again but my aunt & uncle insisted my brother, husband and I stay with them. The 1st night sleeping situation was being discussed after my cousins went to bed. My aunt & uncle wanted me and bro to take the spare bedroom, husband on couch. All 3 of us took issue with that.  They snapped that we were not really married because we were gay, & that they had children in the house. They said that it would be a bad influence on their kids. This hurt my husband\u2019s feelings and he started crying & ran out of the room. When my husband ran out, my uncle had the audacity to start laughing. That\u2019s when I saw red.  I started cussing them out so loudly that my young cousins came to investigate. I told them that if they didn\u2019t go apologize to my husband immediately then I was going to tell my dad what just happened, and I was going to make sure to have them kicked out of the house \u2014 that was still in my parents\u2019 name. My bro seconded everything that I was saying. They started backtracking and saying that we were still welcome in \u201ctheir\u201d house but that we had to follow their rules, I responded that it wasn\u2019t really THEIR house. I told them they were going to be homeless if I had my way. The kids started crying cause they heard me say they were all going to be homeless, so we left. My husband was on the porch crying, I promised him that I would never subject him to that again. I told dad what happened. To say that my dad was angry would be an understatement. He served them a notice of eviction for 60 days. I have been getting calls and texts and Facebook messages from my family calling me AH. I want to know AITA for allowing my young cousins to end up homeless? Is it fair that they have to pay for what my aunt and uncle said to me and my husband?",

        "selftext": "I was asked to be a member of the wedding party. Despite this, I was THE ONLY person, not only in the wedding party, but also at the ceremony, who wasn't allowed to have a +1. This was an outdoor wedding with unlimited seating and these people don't give a shit about COVID so it wasn't about that.    I was told it was because my relationship wasn't serious enough despite us being together for a year. That only engaged or married couples were invited. And that they didn't want some random guy in their wedding pictures who I might not even be with later in the future. They don't want to have to look at some random guy in their pictures even though he wouldn't have been in any of the posed pictures at all. Maybe just in the background of crowd shots.   There have been NO conflicts between them and my boyfriend and he's a nice and mild-mannered guy who gets along with everyone so I don't think it was about him personally.    I get to the ceremony and find out that literally everyone else has a +1, not just married couples, but there are couples there who have been dating for less time than me.    This is when I started feeling surly. I smiled and played my part during the ceremony but inside I was very surly and angry.    We then got to the reception which had way more people than the ceremony. This is where all the more distant friends were invited. AND EVERYONE THERE had a +1. I was literally placed at a table as the one single person and everyone else at the table was a couple. Some at the table were other members of the wedding party, but others were random distant acquaintances. People started asking me where my boyfriend was and I said I was told he wasn't invited. They asked why and I said I had no idea why. This is when I started letting my surliness show and started acting rude and mean, because I was humiliated.    AND THEN, I was brought into conversation with the couple's male friend, Dean. I was previously told that Dean has a crush on me and I made it clear I wouldn't be interested even if I were single. Even after that he kept trying to message me and I ignored him. But now the people who brought me into conversation with Dean were like standing around staring at us and giggling behind their hands. Like they thought they were Cupid matchmakers. Dean was absolutely a participant in this   I was meaner to Dean than I've ever been to anyone in my entire life. I was as fully rude as I've ever wanted to be when being the target of someone's romantic interest unwantedly. It's true I don't really know if I was being set up but I was already furious before that happened. Everyone was silent and awkward.   I went back and finished my meal, and as soon as I was done, picked up my purse and left and went straight to my boyfriend's house, skipping most of the reception, cake cutting, speeches, and everything.    I'm now being told by the couple that they're hurt and confused why I left so early. I haven't replied.",

        "selftext": "I (32f) am getting married to my fianc\u00b4\u00e9 (41m) next year. After we got engaged, I suggested it might be nice if I asked my fianc\u00e9's niece (who's 15) if she wanted to be a bridesmaid too. I've only met her a couple of times, so we're not close, but she seemed like a cool kid and I thought it might be a nice way for us to bond/ get to know each other/ involve her in the wedding. (Side note - she's the only niece/ nephew on either side of the family). Anyway, cut to a few weeks ago and we're in my fianc\u00e9's hometown to visit his family and discuss wedding-related stuff. His brother, sister-in-law and their daughter came over and I noticed this time that she was dressed a lot more androgynous than I remembered. The topic moved to wedding dresses and bridesmaid's dresses and I could see she was immediately uncomfortable. Her parents (her mum really) and grandma were making comments about how she'd need to be more feminine/ brush her hair etc, and how nice it would be to see her like that. I'll be honest and say this hit a nerve with me, as I was very much a tomboy as a teenager (even though I'm not anymore) and it absolutely broke me whenever my relatives would say things like that. Eventually, her mother made a comment along the lines of, It'll be nice to see you dressed like a girl for once. and she looked really sad/ embarrassed/ upset. In response, because that *really* hit a nerve, I immediately told her that my maid of honour would be wearing a trouser suit for the wedding and not a dress and that I'd given all the bridesmaids the option of wearing anything they want as long as it's in the wedding colour, to make things easier. I pulled out my phone and started showing her photos of the ideas my friend had sent me (a jumpsuit, culottes, a trouser suit, a tailored tux etc) and let her know that she could pick anything at all she wanted - she could even wear jeans and trainers if that made her comfortable \u2013 and that it's a wedding, not a fashion show. My niece perked up a bit when I said that but her mum looked really pissed off. She's since asked my fianc\u00e9 to pressure me into getting all the bridesmaids dresses so their daughter will have to wear one (which, lol, no). My husband doesn't give a shit what she wears, but obviously also doesn't want his family and me to be arguing on the wedding day. I don't want to back down because I know what it feels like to be pressured into wearing something that makes you uncomfortable, but on the other hand, I know it's only for a day and it'd make the family happy.  AITA for trying to overrule her parents?",

        "selftext": "My daughter is 12, I'm trying to teach her ways of creating and respecting her boundaries that are age appropriate. Teaching her that it's ok to say No to things she feels uncomfortable with. There is a boy in her class who keeps bothering her and her female friends at recess. I've encouraged her to go to me or her teacher when this happens. My daughter told me a few days ago that in class, the teacher had asked the kids to form groups of about four or five. She had formed a group of five with some other girls, then the boy who had been giving her trouble at recess came over and said he was joining their group. Another girl said that they already have five, and he should work with a group who only have two or three people.  He said no because the teacher had said about four or five. My daughter then said that they didn't want to work with him, and he should find another group. A few of the other girls agreed with her. He said that you can't exclude me like that, it's against class rules and she said she didn't care.  I heard about this from my daughter first, and the way she talked about it, she had been firm but not unkind. But then I got an email from her teacher saying she wanted to call. She said there had been an incident at school where my daughter had excluded another child, and that wasn't allowed in her class, and she wanted me to have a talk with her about it. Her telling of events was the same as my daughter's. I felt proud of my daughter for her honesty.  I sent her an email saying.. Dear Mrs. (Teacher) I'm sorry, but that is not a lesson I feel comfortable teaching my daughter.  She's at the age where she is already having to deal with unwanted attention, and I'm making a point to teach her that she does not have to be around anyone who makes her uncomfortable. And that a young lady is able to choose to spend time with people who make her feel respected. I understand you already are aware (Boy) has been behaving in ways that she feels uncomfortable with at recess, from our prior conversations. I think it is a very dangerous lesson to teach a girl she has to include and be kind to everyone, instead of teaching her to be aware of when someone is not respecting her No and stepping out of the situation. I hope I don't have to explain in too much detail why I find this important... But to put it briefly, I was brought up with the Include everyone mindset. No exceptions. It taught me to ignore my own comfort level, and as I became a young adult I became the victim of men who used my inability to say No to their advantage. It's a dangerous lesson, and no longer appropriate at that age.  Thank you, OP She emailed me back asking for a meeting in person with the principal. I'm preparing for that but wondering if my email was too harsh AITA for my response to my daughter's teacher? //// Edit to update... I reached out to the parents of the other four girls in the class who were involved, and we all coordinated to go speak to the school administration together. They had similar views, thinking it was inappropriate for the school to expect the girls work with someone who they're not comfortable with, and frustrated the teacher didn't do more to deal with the issues during recess that made the girls uncomfortable to start with.  I ended up asking the school if we could reschedule the meeting to a time all the involved families could make, and we ended up meeting this afternoon along with my husband, another couple, two mothers, and a father. Along with the teacher and principal.  We all presented a united front asking for the following... The school does training for the teachers on trauma-informed teaching methods and the dangers of expecting young women to go against their best judgement of their own boundaries to be nice. Instead of Include everyone the kids should be allowed to respectfully set boundaries and taught to respect each other's boundaries. The school addresses harassment in class or at recess and doesn't enable it to continue.  We went to talk, and I think it went a lot better having all the parents join instead of if I'd gone alone. The teacher and principal apologized and the principal agreed to look for resources on how to better navigate the balance between being inclusive and not forcing kids into including someone who is crossing a line with them. Thanks a lot for all the amazing advice in the comments, I cannot believe how much this blew up and I'm so grateful to everyone who replied with advice and support. And honestly was getting pretty emotional hearing how the lessons I'm trying to teach my little one resonated with other women, whether they're moms too, or have been through some of the same struggles I have.",

It\u2019s just cloth.  Anyway the worst instance possible was with this girl named Megan (also 15f). When we were sitting together at lunch she came up to Aysha and I and told Aysha she dared her to take her hijab off, taunting her saying she would look so pretty without it. (This was with malicious intent because I told her one time thinking she was just clueless and wanted to educate her) Then she forcibly tried to remove her hijab. I moved her hand away and we went to the principal. Instead of getting a punishment, Megan made up a sob story about how it would harm her position on some prestigious soccer club she was in.  Fast forward to a few days ago. She makes a TikTok that said \u201cwhen you get called to the principals office for telling the Muslim girl to take off her durag\u201d.  I was so livid for her. Aysha is very shy and didn\u2019t want to seem like a buzzkill, so she asked me personally to email the soccer organization. Well, I did, and she was immediately kicked off and other organizations in the area were notified of her behavior.

        "selftext": "Last week a new colleague Cathy (33f) started at my (25f) work place. She instantly stood out in the team, because she seems like someone who is very... loud and assertive? Two of my colleagues, me and Cathy were having coffee in the break room (we were the only ones in there and we were sitting far apart), when the subject of travel was brought up. My colleague said she wasn't booking trips anymore because it'll probably get cancelled because of covid anyway. Cathy, immediately cut in about how sad she is because she travels so often and she goes on these far exotic trips to Europe as her hobby. When I think exotic I think the Bahamas or something instead of Europe but. Cool. Cathy then jokes about how all this no travel business is making her fear that she'll lose some of her foreign language skills. I asked what languages she spoke. She claimed to be fluent in 3 European languages, among which were French and Dutch. Cathy said she was at a native speaker level and went on about how people in Europe were always surprised when they found out she wasn't from there. I was excited, because I never get to speak Dutch over here. I was raised in Belgium, which has three national languages: French and Dutch (which are my mother tongues and the most commonly spoken there) and German. It's quite common to be pretty fluent in at least two out of the three languages in Belgium, because you're required to learn them at school (along with English) from a young age. I told Cathy oh leuk, dan hebben we iets gemeenschappelijk! (oh fun, we have something in common then!) She immediately pulled this sour face and asked me if that was supposed to be Dutch. I said yes. She laughed awkwardly and said she couldn't understand because I have a terrible accent and must not be that good at speaking it. Now see, I don't have an accent. I speak Dutch more fluently than I speak English. I told Cathy that I grew up speaking Dutch and speak it to my family all the time. She got miffed and asked what languages I speak and where I'm from. I told her I'm from Belgium, so I also speak French and I added which you just said you speak as well, cool! We can speak French instead! I acknowledge that I was a bit of a dick here, because by that point I knew she probably lied about speaking French as well. She then shoved her chair back and angrily got up, said whatever and stomped off. It was awkward. My other colleagues just kinda shrugged and said she shouldn't have lied. However, she later approached me and told me I embarrassed her by acting superior about my European heritage. I told her there was no way for me to know she'd lied about speaking those languages. She rolled her eyes and told me I was immature. A colleague told me that Cathy had called me a little b-word who enjoys bullying new colleagues behind my back later. I don't think I was a bully at all, but I don't want this to turn into a huge thing. Do I just apologize to keep the peace? AITA? ________________________________________________________________________ Edit1: I'm not sure about escalating this to HR, which a lot of people have told me I have to do. I feel like this might make me look immature to the rest of my colleagues (of which I am the youngest) and it might not need to go that far... It depends on if Cathy is willing to put this behind her and be professional. If all else fails I do have witnesses who would be honest about what happened, so I think I might be in the clear if she tries to twist the story.  Edit2: Some people have taken offense to me giving the Bahamas as an example of an exotic place and are trying to make this into a race issue. I didn't know exotic was an offensive term in the US. Do I think of The Netherlands, Belgium, England, Norway, which were countries she was describing as being faraway exotic destinations, as my idea of an exotic trip? No. Not because there's a lot of white people there, but because when I think of exotic I think of a place with nice sunny weather, white sand beaches and a blue ocean. Maybe it's because I'm from Belgium, but I don't really feel like being in my home country where it's dark and rainy all the time is quite that experience.  Edit3: Some people think she might not have understood me because she is fluent in Dutch, but learned it in the Netherlands, which has different accents. While it is true that The Netherlands and Flandres have different accents, I didn't speak a very specific dialect like West-Flemish or something. I spoke the general Dutch you'd see in the news in Flandres. I didn't speak quickly to try and make it incomprehensible to set her up. I genuinely believed she spoke Dutch because that's what she was saying, so I talked to her in normal, conversational Dutch. The same kind of Dutch I'd use in a work environment back in my home country, the same kind of Dutch I use with friends from The Netherlands. (But with a soft g lol.) ",

The baby is health (Thank God) but I'm exhausted, haven't fixed my hair, barely able to shower and can not sleep. My husband's family had been pressuring us to visit to meet the baby. I tried to hold them off as much as I could but yesterday, I was surprised to find them standing on the porch. turns out hubby invited them for dinner. I was embarrassed and felt like I wasn't ready for visitors (judgemental ones at that \ud83d\ude09) cause the house was a M.E.S.S y'all. Anyways, my husband sat with them while I fed my son then later I asked my husband if we should order take out for dinner. He said NO because his parents would find this rude and unwelcoming. He suggested that I go inside the kitchen and prepare something, anything long as it's homemade. I said fine then went and made some Mac N cheese. The reason I prepared this meal is because of how easy it is. Once I served the family, My husband's mom looked at me and was appalled. I noticed something was wrong. She asked if I really found it appropriate to serve her and the family Mac N cheese. I asked why not and she went on a rant about how disrespectful this was and that I clearly have no experience in what is right and wrong when it comes to hosting. I said excuse me? Who said I signed up to host an expected visit from them and she took it as in I didn't want them there. her husband said they were just there to finally see the baby that I kept them from seeing for an entire month. that's a whole month of his life they missed out on. We had an argument and they decided to go home. My husband said that deciding to serve his family Mac N cheese was more offensive then serving them nothing at all. I told him I was too exhausted to cook their traditional feasts that I was forced to learn from his mom. He took offense and said that I was being mean and disrespectful towards not only his family but his culture. I went inside the bedroom to stay with my son. My husband stayed on the phone with his family for an hour then kept giving me the cold shoulder and refused to eat what I cook in support of his family. I understand how some guests might find it offensive especially his family. but I was just trying to make a quick homemade meal like my husband wanted. What's wrong with Mac N cheese? EDIT* Ok, So I'm seeing commenters here offering to come over for some Mac N cheese. It's amazing to hear that some people here would aporeciate this kind of meal. It kinda makes me feel relieved and reassures me that I didn't mess this up entirely. Come on in Y'all! I'll be more than happy to serve you some mac n cheese, some of y'all even offered to bring mashed potatoes and pizza. LOL would love to have y'all over some time.",

He's a quant PM and makes like 10x what I make (and I make a good salary haha!). As we've grown wealthier, I've learned that people become nosier. Friends, acquaintances, relatives, you name it. In the beginning I would entertain the nosy questions, but since I turned 30, I've adopted a take no shit attitude. When people ask me how much he makes, I no longer say anything. I've learned the hard way that giving an exact number can have bad consequences. My co-worker, 25, is new and she already has quite the reputation. Very chatty, catty, gossipy, you get the gist. You can just tell she craves wealth and status. She wears a bunch of flashy designer items and is always asking the ladies around the office which of the men are single. Last Friday, our office hosted an afternoon happy hour. She approached me and asked how me and my husband's recent vacation to Europe went. I told her it went well and briefly summarized what we did. Then the conversation went something like this: Her: So what does your husband do? Me: He works in finance. Her: Oh wow, he must make a ton then to be taking you on all these lavish vacations! I hope you don't mind me asking, but how much does he make in a year?? Me: Yes, we're very lucky that he makes a good salary. *Polite smile* Her: Oh c'monnn I won't tell anyone. How much does he rake in a year? Millions?? Me: *Awkward chuckle* I'd rather not say, but it's up there! Her: What, he doesn't allow you to give an exact number or something?? Me: *Visibly annoyed* No, I just prefer not to say. Her: *Laughs in my face* You'd think the stuck-up one would be the one with money, not the one without! Me: You should learn how to take 'no' for an answer and when to quit being a nosy bitch. It's a valuable lesson. Then I smiled at her and walked away. Later on, I had a few co-workers reach out to me and say that she was crying and left early and that I should apologize for calling her a rude name. I refused. I told my mom and she said I was too rude to the new girl and that she's young and might not fully understand salary talk. I think she's old enough. Husband is fully on my side but said maybe I should fake apologize for the sake of office politics, which I somewhat agree with. But still, AITA?",

Not like laughing gas that wears off really fast, but actual IV medicine so I was pretty much unconscious during the whole thing. They told me to have a responsible adult drive me to the appointment and back because the meds they gave me would make it dangerous to drive. My mom was on a work trip and couldn\u2019t take me, so I asked my sister in law Bri (24, not her real name) if she could do it as the whole thing would only take an hour or two. I even offered gas money because the dental office is about 45 minutes away. I would have asked my brother but he works during the day while bri is a stay at home mom to their 2yo daughter who I think was at bri's mom's house that day. Bri agreed to take me to my appointment and the surgery went fine, bri waited in the lobby for me to be done. When I came out of anesthesia I was very disoriented and nauseous, which I guess is normal. I had gauze shoved in my mouth to stop any bleeding and bri took me to her car after I was let go. I don\u2019t really remember much of the drive but it felt like not enough time passed before bri got out of the car and told me to come with her. I was really out of it and just followed her because the alternative was staying in the hot car. long story short, we were at a pool?? I was really confused but once we were through the gate bri basically parked me at one of those little table-benches said she'd be back in a while. I was still trying not to puke and was really dizzy from the heat (90+ degrees) and the drugs, so I asked her to take me home but she wouldn't. I guess since it was her day off and she didn\u2019t have my niece she was meeting friends at the pool. I was starting to feel really sick and on the verge of passing out or having a panic attack, so I called my brother. I don\u2019t think he could understand me between the meds and the stuff in my mouth because he hung up and I guess called bri because she came stomping back over, cussing and yelling at me, and took me back to the car. I passed out on the drive home, but when we arrived my brother had left work and met us in the driveway. He was screaming at bri and she was crying. I was still pretty disoriented but my brother took me back home and stayed with me until the meds wore off. That's when he told me he's divorcing bri because of what she did plus some other things he didn\u2019t go into detail about. It's been a few days since then and bri has been blowing up my phone telling me what a bitch I am and how me tattling destroyed her family. Part of me feels bad because of my niece and I wonder if I should've jjst dealt with it and waited for her to be done at the pool instead of calling my bro and causing problems. AITA??",

        "selftext": "I'm at a loss here guys. Realistically, I know I'm in the clear. Legally, I'm in the clear. But I'm being vilified by my coworkers, and I'm genuinely considering quitting my job because of this mess. So I work a pretty standard day job, and at night I help my friend at her restaurant, which serves an assortment of Thai cuisine. Tbh I'm insanely picky, but I fell in love with this peanut sauce the main chef makes, and he showed me how to make it, so about once a week I take it on either noodles or stir fry to my day job for lunch. People know this and a handful have tried it. It smells nutty, it tastes nutty. It's white girl pad Thai, basically. Lately my lunches have been disappearing, or I'll open my lunchbox to find half of my food missing. I've tried addressing it, but nothing has been changing, and I was pretty sure it was one of the new hires that was doing it, but had no proof. Until now.  Thursday I took my noodles, and my entire tupperware was missing, which hasn't happened before. I'm pissed, but what can I do? A coworker shared her pizza with me and that was that, until today. My boss confronted me and accused me of poisoning my noodles because his daughter (one of the new girls) borrowed my lunch and had to be hospitalized. Turns out she's severely allergic to nuts, ate some and boom. Anaphylaxis.  She used an epi pen, had to be hospitalized and now her dad is trying to hold me accountable for her bills and condition, but I don't see it. Why should I pay? I don't mark my food as an allergen because I'm not allergic to it, she was just dumb enough to steal from me and eat something she can't have.  But he's being hateful, and some of my older coworkers are icing me out because I warned him I'd report any harassment to HR if he tried anything funny. Brown nosers, I guess. My friend is aware and offered me a full time job, but I just can't help but feel it's unfair. At the same time, I could have killed his daughter tho... So, AITA?  Edit: holy shitballs this blew up!  I *did* email the HR rep and let her know of the situation. She's been on vacation and gets back tomorrow, so I don't know if she's aware of what's been going on since last week. I should note that I work weekends most weeks, not quite a 8-5 M-F job, but yeah.   My coworkers mostly chilled out by the end of my shift, thankfully, after I explained to the (nosiest) friendlier person that I always bring a peanut sauce dish. I guess the general assumption was that I somehow found out who has been stealing lunches and decided to poison them?  To answer a common question: this was the first time my pad thai was stolen, and no I'm not the only victim of the lunch thief. I usually take a late lunch, and I'm not the only one, so I'm guessing the lady who was stealing food decided what was left is a free for all. F her. My boss said it was an HR issue when I'd tried talking to him about lunches disappearing, and HR always said they'd look into it (or further into it) and nothing ever happened. We're 100% not allowed to eat at our desks, unless you have a medical reason for it, so that wasn't an option either.  I'm assuming she's fine, but I don't know the severity of her allergy or how much she ate before she had her reaction. I'm not privy to her medical information, sorry guys.  Suing.... Sounds like a great revenge, but probably not worth the cost of a lawyer. My friend let me take tonight off to just bitch about everything, and I'm probably going to take her job offer. One commenter was right; even if everything settles down, I don't want to deal with a potentially hostile or reactive workplace like this anymore. It's not a  career with much room for upward mobility, and I didn't feel welcome in our group meeting today. And for the people calling this fake, okay? It's not, but even if it were, why are you getting mad about it? Karma doesn't give me anything, monetarily or status. I can't exactly give out a bunch of details unless I want to dox myself, and the post seems rushed because I wrote it out of frustration during my lunch. Short time+word limit= rushed. Sorry it didn't meet your writing standards.  Anyway, I'll keep reading comments and responding occasionally, but this is it for me unless I get something worth updating. Thanks for everyone's opinions! (And the information about Caesar dressing and Worcestershire [thanks Google] having anchovies. That's crazy!)   Edit: the recipe  2 tbsp red curry paste 3/4 cup smooth natural peanut butter1/4 cup sugar2 tsp dark soy sauce2 tbsp cider vinegar3/4 cup of water12 oz of coconut milk I cook it on med-low heat and add more water if it seems too thick. And use regular coconut milk!! The low fat isn't as good imo  I had to find one for home that seemed similar to the restaurant's since I'm not making enough for an army! I like this one, but I'm also lazy and want it done in 15 minutes. I hope everyone likes it! If not... Well, you tried something new And the natural pb is important! Nuttier, stronger and far less sugar",

        "selftext": "I have big boobs. I\u2019m currently at 52kg and there\u2019s nothing I can do to change the size of these things unless I have surgery. I\u2019m also extremely shy and from a very conservative family so my resentment and shame towards my bust is an ongoing issue.  My friend *Sarah is one of those unfiltered free thinkers who says whatever is on her mind. She\u2019s also slim and her chest is very much in proportion to the rest of her body. We work together and I\u2019m always secretly jealous of how great shirts and tops look on her whereas I feel I look very sloppy and unprofessional with oversized, ill fitting clothes.  Sarah has this way of always bringing up my boobs in conversation, starting off complimentary but often ending with an subtle insult. She knows they\u2019re a physical feature I\u2019m uncomfortable with but doesn\u2019t let up. Examples of things she\u2019ll say is how my boobs look good now but give it a few years, and they\u2019ll be down to my knees, hahaha! Or she\u2019ll show me comments on reddit where people are discussing chest size preferences and most are commenting how they much prefer a smaller bust over large. Or just a general reminder of how work or men will never take me seriously because of my \u2018cartoon boobs\u2019. I know she\u2019s trying to have lighthearted fun but it gets to me and I\u2019ve told her a few times to drop it before.  Now we\u2019re working from home, we all have daily video calls and meetings. Uniform is not necessary and can wear what we like. A few days ago, it was extremely hot and I was wearing a lighter, more revealing top than my usual baggy coverups. During this video call, in front of 6 other colleagues, Sarah starts vocalising her thoughts on my appearance: *\u2018Holy shit! Put those away! You look like you\u2019re in a porno. We don\u2019t need to see that first thing in the morning, hahaha.\u2019* I was mortified. One other colleague laughed along but the rest looked uncomfortable. I felt close to tears, made an excuse and left the meeting. Sarah called me up half an hour later asking me what was wrong and I went off on her. Told her to go fuck herself and was sick of her constant jabs about my appearance. I went on a 10 minute tirade and hung up. Sarah has been off sick since that day and we haven\u2019t spoken again. I\u2019m wondering if I was too harsh and maybe should call and apologise for my outburst? Was I TA?  **Edit:** I\u2019m fuming. I just spoke with a colleague, *John, (who was part of the video call that day) and he told me that Sarah\u2019s been telling everyone that it\u2019s ME that\u2019s been bullying her and making her feel insecure about her appearance. When she made those comments during the meeting, it was in retaliation to how I\u2019ve made her feel. Apparently, I said she looks like a boy and called her flat chested and ugly several times in the past. I have NEVER and would never say this! I don\u2019t even understand the stupid \u2018boy body\u2019 insult because a small bust has always looked very beautiful and classy in my eyes. Anyway, John knows she\u2019s full of shit and has suggested we speak with HR. The others will also back me up. I know most people here suggested I do this and I wasn\u2019t sure at first but fuck it, I\u2019m reporting her. I don\u2019t know why I ever considered her a friend, she\u2019s fucking mental and annoying. **Edit 2:** I now feel stupid for even asking the question AITA. I thought I may have been at one point because the video call was amongst mostly work mates rather than clients and I wasn\u2019t sure if my sensitivity towards my body image made me overreact to a joke that could have been innocent (I now realise it wasn\u2019t). I\u2019ve also spoken to another coworker who is closer to Sarah and she thinks Sarah may have  already reported me to HR. She said the phone conversation we had after the meeting was filled with abusive bullying language and physical threats. It wasn\u2019t a pleasant phone call but the worst thing I said was she go fuck herself and that I don\u2019t want to speak to her again. The rest of the conversation was just rehashing all the comments she made about my body and how it made me feel. She also claimed that I have been making inappropriate jokes about her appearance and work ethic(?) through the years and this confrontation was a long time coming. She also suggested that I\u2019ve convinced the guys in the office to take my side by being a flirt and a tease (did I mention that I\u2019m stupidly shy?) My head is swimming and I think I may be dealing with an actual psycho. I don\u2019t know how it\u2019s come to this ridiculous level of craziness. All I wanted to do was get on with my fucking work in peace and get through this crappy time but now I have to deal with this bullshit. **Update:** Just to answer a few questions I\u2019ve seen: - I\u2019ve contacted HR with my complaint. I have a lot of old text messages and emails with comments and memes Sarah has sent making fun of my chest size. John and other colleagues are fully supporting me as well as my manager. It will take a while for them to get back to me but I\u2019m confident that things will be sorted and Sarah will be dealt with. - My breasts alone aren\u2019t 52kg (114lbs). My overall weight is 52kg. I mentioned this because my chest seems much larger on my small frame making clothes that others wear and look nice in, look completely gaudy and cheap on me. I can\u2019t lose anymore weight to make a difference on my bust size. I won\u2019t get surgery but I have been working on my body image issues which my shyness and upbringing did a number on. People\u2019s comments don\u2019t usually devastate me as they once did but Sarah obviously tried her best to break me down. - Thank you to all for clothing suggestions. I will definitely look into tailoring some tops and have spent some time checking out Bravissimo which looks great. - In hindsight, I should have confronted Sarah more sternly in the past but I guess I was trying to avoid conflict. Others have suggested I may have allowed her to gaslight me which may be true. I just want to move on at this point. **Update 2:** The coworker (*Lucy), who keeps in contact with Sarah and told me earlier that Sarah may have reported me to HR, has just phoned to tell me that Sarah has suffered a serious panic attack. Lucy does not want to take sides but has suggested I reconsider taking drastic action. Sarah is too unwell to talk to me herself but has asked I drop my complaint and she will drop hers, citing the whole thing as a misunderstanding and stress-induced disagreement.  I have had panic attacks before in my life and I seriously felt like I was going to die. It\u2019s a horrible feeling and if Sarah has honestly just had one herself, I don\u2019t want to push her too far. I still want to address her comments over the video call but I\u2019m wondering if I should just drop the other complaints. Sarah has asked to move teams so we don\u2019t directly work with one another but it doesn\u2019t seem she wants to apologise yet. And just to clarify to people who assume I was wearing a bikini top or boob tube during the meeting, I wasn\u2019t. It was a short sleeved plain tshirt which hugged my breasts more than my usual baggy tops.  I don\u2019t like to hold grudges and I think getting her fired during a time like this may be a shitty thing to do. I feel she has already punished herself by displaying this fucked up behaviour to others and losing a lot of respect from coworkers. If we don\u2019t ever have to interact with one another, I\u2019m up for that. I have a suspicion that Sarah may have found this post and read it which I thought I would feel bad about but I really don\u2019t care. **Last Update:** I\u2019m not dropping any of the complaints. Sarah (fuck you Michelle) and I have spoken, and although it started off promising, she is mentally unhinged and without a conscience. I did not realise how deep her hatred runs. Not only did she mock all those things I had told her in confidence about the way my family treated me growing up, she accused me of fucking every guy from work to get ahead. Now I know where some of those fake office rumours about me came from. I\u2019ve been such a naive idiot and allowed my shyness and aversion to conflict to stop me from fighting people who manipulate and walk all over me. I don\u2019t need this misery in my life. If she\u2019s reading this, get professional help immediately. I know you desperately fancy John and, as you said, despise the way he looks at me. I know it bothers you that he took my side and has been a great support. Maybe I will go for drinks with him when lockdown ends.  If I don\u2019t make any new updates, just assume that the right person was reprimanded and faced the consequences of their words and actions.",

        "selftext": "My son was born when I was only 15 years old, and I\u2019ve been a single dad since I was 18. It was hard living for a long time money-wise but I always tried to do best by my son. Today I own my own gym and my son is now 22 and going to college and works at my gym full-time. He came out to me when he was 14 years old and I\u2019ve always been supportive of him and his identity.  I\u2019ve been with my fianc\u00e9 now for about 2 years and while she does come from a very deep religious and conservative family, she has never had any issue with my son \u2013 at least nothing she has ever expressed to me. My son has been dating his boyfriend since he was 18 and I\u2019ve gotten to know him really well. However my fianc\u00e9 told me recently that she does not want my son\u2019s boyfriend to come to the wedding nor does she want her parents to even get the inclination that my son is gay. That if they found out, they would have a complete fit. This really bothered me because I refuse to ask my son to go back in the closet. What is going to happen in the future? When my son gets married himself? Will they want him and his husband barred from other family events? He\u2019s my son and will be the best man and it would be unfair to deny him a plus one because her family has an issue with gay people. When I told her this, she got very angry with me and told me that I was being selfish and over-dramatic \u2013 that it would just be for this one day, that she wants the perfect wedding. I told her that this was unacceptable and that I was not going to ask my son not to bring his boyfriend. It\u2019s my wedding too and I was his boyfriend there.  After that I got the silent treatment for a day and since then it hasn\u2019t been discussed again. However, it has left an extremely bad taste in my mouth and has me contemplating calling the wedding off. I do not want to marry into a family that would potentially discriminate against my son. I love my fiance very much but my son will always come first. I told my brother and he said that I was being the asshole here \u2013 that it would just be for one day and that since my son is an adult, it\u2019s unlikely that he would have that much interaction with his \u201cstep grandparents\u201d in the future anyway. I still don\u2019t feel comfortable about the entire situation and am really thinking about calling the wedding off. Would I be the asshole if I did this? Am I being unreasonable here?",

This year, my husband told me I could go with him and his friend since they were visiting a new destination. He paid for my ticket and everything else since I'm a sahm and have no job. the kids were left with my mom. However. When I found out that he had booked 1st class for himself and his friend while I got economy. I just couldn't hold my tongue. I confronted him about it and he at first refused to discuss then when the argument got heated he yelled I PAID FOR YOUR TICKET FFS!!! ISN'T THAT ENOUGH??? then kept on about how I should stop acting like I was royalty and that if I come to think about it, even economy is fine for me since I technically don't work anyway. I cried because of what he said but decided to just not go altogether. He changed his tone and started begging me to just go with what he planned but I declined. I went to pick the kids from my mom's house and he came back 3 hrs later huffing and buffing about what happened. His friend sent me a text calling me entitled, and said this was the reason why he didn't want my husband to take me with them and I just proved his point. I did not respond but I blocked him since he's gotten increasingly rude over the past few months. He (my husband) said I keep crying about being excluded and this is what happens when he finally decides to include me. amitheasshole for not settling for economy? by the way he's perfectly capable of financing the trip.",

        "selftext": "This is a shitty situation but here we go.  Me and my daughter, Anya, are from India. Our native language is Hindi. She 11 years old now. Her father died when she was 5 and I immigrated to states because everyone was trying to get me remarried to a 60 year old sleazebag because oh no. How ever will a woman live or raise a child alone.  I stated dating my now-husband when Anya was 6. He had a 5 year old son, Ben (50% custody). Me, Anya, Ben, Husband and Ben's mum get along really well. The kids were very well adjusted and they were genuinely happy when we got married. Whenever tensions arose, we dealt with them patiently. Let's just say after walking through the minefield of Indian family/drama, diffusing these toy bombs were very easy.  Anya has a habit of talking in Hindi when she gets really excited. Sometimes, while talking to me, she starts talking in Hindi without even realising it. This wasn't a problem. If she does that while others are around, I would remind her and she would revert back to English.  Few months ago, Ben's mum passed away and he came to live with us full time. He has a room already and we put Ben into therapy immediately.  A week ago, Ben walked in when me and Anya were cooking and we were talking in Hindi and he started crying. He told me he is feeling bad that he can't understand what we are saying. I hugged him and consoled him and assured him that we didn't do it to exclude him purposefully. And then Anya started crying and apologised. The whole thing was just heartbreaking.  Since then, Anya has been making concious efforts to talk only in English and I can tell that it puts Ben at ease. Yesterday, however, she was frustrated and started lamenting about school work in Hindi to me. Me and Anya were in the living room and Ben and husband were in the kitchen and they heard it.  Later that night, my husband told me how he thinks we must start thinking about giving punishments whenever she speaks in Hindi unconsciously until Ben starts feeling better.  I was horrified at this suggession. I have never pulled the She is my daughter, not yours card. But this is the hill I am willing to die on and use that card if necessary.  Whether he likes it or not, it's her first language. Expecting her to always converse in her second language, even when she is feeling some extreme emotions is just cruel. Especially after she is genuinely making an effort to make Ben feel more comfortable. It's almost like punishing for her heritage or for her being Indian.  Of course, this is a huge point of conflict between me and my husband. I think it's unfair to do this to Anya, even temporarily. He thinks me and Anya are unnecessarily making feel Ben bad while he is mourning his mother, while we can try and prevent it.  Both of us are conflicted here. Who is the asshole here?",

        "selftext": " Hello!  I f23 have been married to my husband m26 for a year. I'm in my last year of university and been so so busy for the last two weeks, with many projects and finals looming. My husband complains from seeing me studying and not doing activities together or hanging out with friends anymore. I've told him it's not gonna last forever and that I need to focus because this is my last year and it's been the hardest.  The day before the exam he wanted me to go with him to a friend's birthday party. I refused because I was busy preparing for my exam. he pleaded with me saying it's just one hour and talked about how his friends will be upset if I'm not there. I said no and shut down any further discussions. He got upset and called me selfish and inconsiderate but then dropped it. Before I went to bed, I set my alarm clock like I always do since I'm a heavy sleeper+I stayed up late studying. The next morning I woke up at 9am. I literally freaked out and checked my alarm and found that it was set to go off at 9:30 am. I had no idea how this happened til my husband told me he did this to repay me for refusing to take one, one hour to attend the party so he took this hour from my time. I couldn't believe it I absolutely blew up at him just yelling and screaming at him left and right. He just stood there shocked from my reaction and my rage. I got dressed quickly and rushed to the university.  They didn't let me into the exam hall. I got into a lot of hassle to get them to re-schedule the exam especially since I had no legit reason as to why I was late. It was awful is all I can say. I went home and my husband and I stopped speaking to each other. He kept acting as if I hurt his feelings and traumatized him by yelling. And that I deserve what he did since he was frustrated with my continual refusal to attend all events for the past 2 weeks. I might be wrong for not considering it but I think that my exams should be a priority and his way of teaching me a lesson was not right.",

        "selftext": "Yeah I know this sounds insane but I\u2019m living in it.  So my sister is getting married next February, destination wedding no less. I have doubts whether this wedding is actually going to happen with the pandemic and everything but she is totally set on moving forward. Anyways because of the pandemic, her original venue has made her cut down on guests because they\u2019re cutting capacity by half. As a result she\u2019s sending out \u201cre-invites\u201d that asks everyone to RSVP again. But in order to figure out who to invite and who to cut, she\u2019s asking all confirmed guests to submit two 250-word \u201cessays\u201d to two questions. The gist is that they\u2019ll use these essays to choose who can come or not, based on people\u2019s enthusiasm. People who don\u2019t write the essays at all will be automatically disqualified. I just feel really insulted by all of this. The questions aren\u2019t even pandemic-related, its broad topics like \u201dwhy do you still want to celebrate this day with us?\u201d And \u201cwhat will attending our wedding mean to you specifically?\u201d So she\u2019s blatantly looking for people to kiss ass and tell her why they REALLY want to go.  Anyways I told her in advance I\u2019m not writing 500 words on why I NEED to attend her wedding, spend my own money on plane tickets/hotels, and buy her a present. This has really rubbed her and my parents the wrong way. She\u2019s said that to keep things fair if I don\u2019t fill out the RSVP correctly I won\u2019t be saved a spot. I said fine with me. Then my parents said if I don\u2019t show up I\u2019m going to be in big fucking trouble with all our relatives so just write the essays.  AITA if I stay stubborn on this? I\u2019m already annoyed at the thought of spending thousands and coming home to quarantine. But I will not belt out 500 words on how this is totally my choice. AITA? Edit: I\u2019m 27F. I don\u2019t live with family but she is my only sister. Edit2: Sister has framed these essays as \u201csurveys\u201d but there\u2019s a word limit requirement so if you don\u2019t reach it on the google forms you can\u2019t even submit. Parents think this is perfectly reasonable, nice even, because sister is letting everyone have the chance to attend.",

        "selftext": "My husbands girl best friend (we'll call her Madison) has never liked me, for reasons I guess I will never know. Anyways my fiance (we'll call him Michael) and I were having a hangout with a little bit of the friends that we shared. It was nearing the end of the night and Madison was the only friend left when Madison came out crying with Michael looking angry, (I was around nine months pregnant at the time). The thing that really caught my attention is when Michael called me a raging b**** and a c**t. Myself being a hormonal pregnant women started crying at the name calling. I asked through my tears what was going on and he then proceeds to tell me about a text message I sent to Madison. In the message I told her to f*** off and about how Michael and I would not allow her near our child. I will admit that I did send this, but it was taken completely out of context, I only sent this text after the many racist text messages that she sent me talking about my child and I. I am biracial. Instead of hearing me out Michael kicked me out of the house that we shared (his name was on the lease). Without arguing I decided to leave not wanting to start anything else, as I was walking out the door I felt a cramp in my lower abdomen. I thought nothing of this because I was not due for another three weeks, when I flinched from the pain Michael told me to stop faking. On the way to my moms house I felt a gush of water and immediately turned the car around so that I would make it to the hospital. While driving I took out my phone to call Michael but my call was quickly declined. At this point I was in to much pain to call anyone else and arrived at the hospital. I pushed for two hours without an epidural and gave birth to a beautiful baby girl named Grace Noel. Giving birth without my fiance by my side was the final straw for me, I decided to do something and post all the hurtful messages Madison sent me on facebook. Maybe 45 min-1 hour later Michael calls me asking me if we could talk, I inform him about my whereabouts and he shows up about  42 minutes later. He has tried to apologize multiple times, But I dont think I can forgive him. I went through the pain of pushing out an 8 pound baby by myself all because he chose to believe his best friend without listening to his fiance. AITA for not wanting to forgive him??",

        "selftext": "  I (28F) do babysitting on the weekends to make some babysitting on the weekends to make extra cash. There is one family I definitely should've fazed out by now but the kids are cute and if I don't have another job, it's easy money. My issue is, the mom is never home on time. She used to not give me return times but finally I started asking as it made it impossible to get anything done on the weekends. I'd go babysit so she could go to brunch but she'd be gone from 11 AM to 7 PM. My whole day was gone. After that, she'd start giving me times but never stick to them. She wouldn't even call to tell me, she'd just stay out. On Saturday, I got to her house at 6 and she was supposed to be home by 9. I told her she needed to be on time because I had plans to go out with friends. I was even getting ready at their house after I put the kids to be. She promised. Of course, 9:00 rolls around and she's not home. I call her, no response. Text, no response. Another hour. Nothing. Still calling and texting. Finally, it is midnight. By this point, my plans are long ruined but I'm pissed and exhausted. I call her and leave a voicemail saying if she's not home in the next hour, I'm considering the kids abandoned and calling the cops. I also text her this. I try calling her 30 minutes later and it goes to voicemail on the second ring, I text her again and she leaves me on read. If she had reached out saying Hey, I'm staying out until x time, I would've stayed. I don't know any of her family nor the father of the kids so I can't call them. I gave her a grace period of 15 minutes and tried calling again, finally called the cops (non-emergency line). They showed up and I showed our agreement in text from earlier in the week confirming that she'd be home by 9. They try contacting her, didn't answer. I was dismissed and they took the children to the police station. I go home and go to bed. I am awoken at 3 AM by a frantic call. It's her. Where are the kids? Why am I not here? I tell her I followed through on my threat, check the police station. She cursed me out, I hung up and went to bed. The next day, she sends me an essay saying the kids' father was called and there's a DCF investigation launched against her. She called me every name under the sun but I didn't think I was wrong until I spoke to a friend with kids. She said I should've just waited it out and refuse to ever sit for her again. She asked if her potentially losing her kids was worth me being petty.",

She was a single mom of three kids when we started dating, she had two daughters (now 10 & 12) and a son (now 16). I\u2019ve watched these kids grow up, I\u2019ve read the bedtime stories, done bath time, the first days of school, pta meetings, all of it. I very much consider them to be my kids, and they\u2019ve been calling me mom for almost 6 years now. My brother Ivan (28m) just had a baby girl with his fianc\u00e9 Sara (27f). I love my niece, and my kids adore their cousin. My kids have been the only grandchildren on my side of the family since Ava and I got together, and there\u2019s never been a moment where the kids and my wife were treated like they didn\u2019t belong.My brother is their uncle, my mom and dad are their nana and pop\u2014 the kids see my family as their family and I always thought that my family felt the same way about them. The kids and I were over at my brother's house just hanging out, and my parents ended up dropping by with gifts for my niece.Ivan laughed when he saw the toys and told our mom and dad that they were going to end up spoiling her rotten. My mom said since my niece is their first grandchild of course they have to spoil her. My kids were sitting in the living room with all of us and my youngest daughter looked hurt when she realized what my mother said. My son and my 12yo didn\u2019t fully react to it, but I could tell it bothered the both of them too. Sara spoke up and said \u201coh you mean first grandbaby, not first grandchild.\u201d My dad shook his head and replied that my niece was their first grandchild. I didn\u2019t want my kids to keep sitting there and listening to that so I handed my son my keys and told him to wait in the car with his sisters. When they were gone, I asked my parents why the hell they\u2019d say that my kids weren\u2019t their grandchildren, and my mom said they couldn\u2019t be their grandchildren because they weren\u2019t really my children. My wife and I were going to be hosting thanksgiving at our house this year, but I told my parents that if they didn\u2019t view my kids as their family, then they could just host a meal at their own house with their \u201creal\u201d family while I spent the holiday with mine. I left before they could say anything else to me, and my wife and I have reiterated to the children that they will always be my kids and I will always be their other mom, regardless of our DNA. My brother is pissed at me now because he thinks I reacted too harshly, and that I should try to see where my parents are coming from. My mom texted saying that she and my dad love the kids, but they still aren\u2019t their grandchildren, and she hopes that we can come to understand that because she doesn\u2019t want this to ruin my niece\u2019s first thanksgiving. I haven\u2019t replied back. I meant what I said, but I\u2019m worried that maybe I\u2019m reacting too harshly. ETA INFO: I adopted all three of the kids about 4 years ago, so they aren't just my parents step grandchildren. Even if I hadn't legally adopted them, they'd still be my kids in my eyes. Edit no.2: - My wife's parents don't have a relationship with the kids. When my wife came out, they pretty much stopped speaking with her entirely.- Their bio dad is not involved and neither is his family. He lost his rights to the children before Ava and I started dating. The 10yo has never met him, the 12yo doesn't remember him, and the 16yo wants nothing to do with him.- My parents wanted the kids to call them Nana and Pop. I didn't make the kids start calling them that.",

        "selftext": "I work at a petting zoo here, and this weekend we had two teenager (around 16, boyfriend and girlfriend) who were antagonizing a llama. I told them you might want to cut that out! Llamas spit in self-defense. But they kind of laughed my warning off. Now, I knew that llama spit was a whole lot worse than they probably thought it was. But I decided not to tell them about that. I figured if they persisted, I'd trust the llama to teach them a lesson. The llama was being patient. At one point it gave them a warning spit (just saliva) and they went eww and laughed about it and brushed it off, and then kept going at it. Finally, the llama had enough...and unleashed its green, defensive spit that llamas are known for. It got the girl square in the face. She dropped to her knees and started retching, and eventually threw up. Her boyfriend was gagging and ran away, towards the building that I was in. To make things worse for them, I didn't even let them come in to wash up in the petting zoo's only bathroom! It was a slow day, so I just locked the doors. I told them I didn't want that smell inside, and made them leave the farm without washing up. AITA? The girl's parents called me the next day and yelled at me saying that was too harsh. Maybe it was...I knew that if you don't wash out llama spit right away the smell sinks into your skin and becomes extremely hard to remove, but I wanted the lesson to sink in as well.",

So today I was at my parent's house to celebrate Christmas Eve with my side of the family (as this year I will be spending Christmas with my girlfriend's this year). Anyways, we opened presents up early this morning. Something I should note about my sister is that she LOVES her children. Which is great and I do love my nephews, but every year she gets me magnets, pictures, blankets and pretty much anything she can plaster her kids on.  While it's nice, I don't have a shrine at my house dedicated to them and I know this might sound selfish, but I don't really want them as I don't know what to do with them. They end up in a drawer or something, cause one year she got me a large tapestry thing with her kids on it, and it was HUGE. Obviously I didn't want to hang it up as it quite literally covered the entire wall. I never say anything to her as I don't want to offend her and ruin Christmas. So that's when I had the genius idea of doing the same thing but with my dog. I put him in a little tie, took his picture and put it in a frame. I love my dog as my child, so I figured I'd gift it to my sister. (I also got her a $25 Starbucks card as she's obsessed with them and I wasn't trying to be petty). Anyways, she opens it up and her face drops. Then she goes to me and says, what the fuck am I supposed to do with this? Without a thought I said, same thing I do with yours, it'll look good on your coffee table.  Long story short, she got mad, my family is pretty much on my side expect for a couple of people who thought it was funny but in the end dogs aren't comparable to humans. Which I don't necessarily agree with and wasn't the point of the gift, but whatever, I thought it was funny, but I need unbiased opinons, AITA?",

I have a variety of plants like Lily, aloe vera, also flowers and they all require care and attention. It's a hobby of mine and because I don't own enough space I just stick to indoor planting. I have a 16 year old stepson Sean who loves to pull all kinds of pranks and has been trying some weird-prankes on me lately. I don't mind it as long as he's happy and also because nothing is too serious just hiding my farming tools/replacing them with damaged ones and so on. He just keeps messing around like any other kid. days ago he posted a FB video of him spraying cold water on me when I was sleeping. It was embarrassing since he shared it with family. I got mad at him and had him delete it despite him begging me to let him keep it. He kept sulking afterwards and had his mom try to convince me to let him repost the video but I thought that was crazy request. Sean suddenly became friendly and asked if he could water my plants, I was glad he asked and gave him the watering can and told him to start with the plants in the kitchen. He was gone for few minutes then he got back and started watering all the plants in the house. Later in the evening I was cleaning my tools and there was a weird smell coming from the watering can. It smelled like bleach. I freaked out and checked my plants and the same smell was coming from them . I confronted Sean and asked what he watered the plants with. He acted dumb and said nothing but I found a bottle of bleach in his room which made me lose my temper. He admitted watering my plants with bleach to get back at me for making him remove the video. I was mortified I immediately canceled the weekend trip to the national park that he was looking forward to. he started crying saying it was too much and he made a mistake in moment of clouded judgement. I refused to discuss it, My wife feels bad Sean hasn't been eating well since I canceled the trip but he damaged my plants and caused me hurt and pain. She thinks an apology was enough, he is a kid and made a mistake. She wanted me to let it go but I said canceling the trip is his official punishment, Period I got called unreasonable and stubborn for this and that I don't respect her as a parent too and said taking away the only thing he cares about the most and look forward the most reeks of ab%$&se. Sean has this mentally that if he admits doing something wrong then he'll be forgiven. This isn't how it should be but his mother thinks admitting to it and apologizing should be the end of it.",

On top of that, some of her friends (some were bridesmaids) said that I was a asshole for breaking up what would've been a healthy marriage. But its my daughter's happiness that matters. AITA?",

Recently I\u2019ve moved back home during the stay at home orders to look after my parents. My brother still lives with them. I find out he\u2019s been trying to date in recent months and confessed it\u2019s been pretty unsuccessful for him. He even got to go on a first date but his date literally got up and left after about a half hour.  I know exactly the reason why and it\u2019s not flattering. For one thing my parents coddled him since he was a kid because he was on the spectrum and was the only boy in our family. My mom in particular always told him he was smarter and more advanced than everyone else who\u2019s neurotypical. This has led to his belief today that he genuinely is smarter than everyone else, especially women who he thinks are inherently irrational, illogical people.  So I know how he interacts with women like me or his other sisters. He tends to say very hurtful things first and when we get upset, he will then say things like \u201cyou are being irrational/hysterical/illogical, I\u2019m just being honest and you can\u2019t accept it.\u201d This is like his catch phrase over the years and drives us absolutely INSANE.  Anyways when he asked me I basically said, \u201clisten the truth is your way of talking to women can come across as extremely demeaning and borderline sexist.\u201d I told him he acts like he can read every woman perfectly when he\u2019s pretty much always wrong. This struck the wrong nerve with him and he later complained to my parents that I attacked him over things he can\u2019t control.  Now I\u2019m in hot water for \u201cruining his confidence\u201d and I feel both bad and kinda relieved at the same time. This was the first time in my life I told him how annoying his behavior is because growing up our mom always blamed us whenever he got upset. But maybe I was too harsh?

Or cut all the roses off her bushes because they were too cheap to buy from the florist I guess. Anyway my dash cam of my car which I park in the driveway near the garden bed caught most all of them close up and as a way to help my mom not have her plants stolen I printed all their pictures out and made a poster that said  Oh Hay there! Don't be a Daffy-dil and steal, or else you might end up doing hard Thyme! We hope Thistle be a lesson to Yew!  And I put the pictures of everyone stealing from the garden around the border. Also gave each person a funny fake name : mr potato head dill-a-tante pothead prick 'Succ-er  i peony in my pants frond-less 'dirt-bag' 'in-fertile and root boy  . I thought it was funny and cutesy, like how can you be offended with dumb plant puns... My mom thought it was hilarious and wanted me to hang it up because she was sick of seeing stuff stolen  But I got a couple complains, one neighbor said I needed to take it down because I had a picture of his son a minor who did something dumb yes but was just trying to bring his sick girlfriend flowers. And that is was disproportionate and rude to publicly shame him. I told him that it wasn't that big of a deal and he told me that I was being petty. I called his kid a little Birch which pissed him off and honestly might of been petty. Another guy came to the house and returned a cutting his wife apparently tookbto propogate thinking it would be no big deal... But yeah it damaged the plant because she cut like a quarter off. And he asked if we'd take down the sign because she was on the board of directors or something from the town and whatever. My mom had answered the door and told him to make like a bee and buzz off.  Anyway I guess they both know each other and now both these familys are annoyed.  AITA for making a petty sign about people stealing from my mom's garden? Hoping to get them to stop?",

        "selftext": "I M39 lost my late wife 6 years ago. I have a16 year old son 'Daniel' and I recently got engaged to my fiancee of 2 years.Her mom and I aren't on good terms because of how she behaves. She's a controlling, self-centered, Dolly parton wanna be. I learn to ignore her crap but she's been annoying Daniel and criticizing his personality regularly (he's a private kid and still hasn't gotten used to the new family dynamic but he's in therapy and is doing fine) she keeps diagnosing him left and right calling him anti-social, autistic and other crap. Fact is, Daniel is a shy, well manared kid but people confuse that with being anti-social.MIL tried several time to force Daniel to open up by embarrassing him with personal questions on family dinners and test his personality type. I've realized the effect her behavior had on Daniel so I gave him the choice to no longer be in the same room/house as MIL and he appreciated this alot. MIL didn't like that Daniel kept his distance and no longer visits and kept bitching about how spoiled he will become for her daughter to deal with. I told her to stop bringing it up but she cried I'm just doing this for Daaannny; Last week she visited unexpectedly wanting to say hi to Daniel. After Daniel greeted her he went into the bathroom and she went into the livingroom with my fiancee.I was in my bedroom when Daniel came and said his journal was gone. We looked for it but didn't find it. I asked my fiancee who was alone in the kitchen but didn't see it. I paused for a second to ask where MIL was, My fiancee said in the living room but I saw her coming down the stairs. I asked where she was, she said the bathroom. I saw her purse in hand so I bluntly asked if she took Daniel's journal. She looked offended and called for my fiancee when I insisted to see inside her purse. She wanted to leave but I didn't let her. Fiancee told me to stop it but I insisted and the journal was there. MIL tried to explain this was her only chance to get to know Daniel better because she cares about him. I blew up at her and berated her for stealing from my son and told her she's banned from my house for the stunt she pulled. she argued with me then left.My fiancee apologized for her but said banning her from the house was over the top.It backlashed and and FIL argued and hoped his daughter realizes how f///ing ab///ve I am and call off the wedding for refusing to apologize to MIL. Fiancee said her family won't come to the wedding til I reconcile with her mom and cancel the ban but I won't let my son be disrespected in his own house and asked my fiancee to understand. I'm refusing to reconcile but am aware this could ruin my relationship with all my inlaws not just MIL and my fiancee thinks I'm selfish to cause drama.",

        "selftext": "I am 100% being petty here but curious if I am actually wrong. Most of my husbands family think I am being childish and need to let the past go, as my SIL can't afford this but her behavior toward us in the past makes me feel this is warranted. 2 years ago my house burnt to the ground after being struck by lightening. Thankfully it was during the day so our 3 kids were at school and my husband and I were at work. We lost everything but we were safe. It took almost 11 months for the insurance to pay out. The insurance covered 1 month worth of hotel stays but after that we were made to fend for ourselves and the only option we had was to move in with my SIL. She tells us we can have her spare room and her office space, since she used neither of the rooms and her stipulations was we needed to purchase all of our own food and pay her $100 a week. By week 3 all of that changed. She then decides we need to pay her $250 a week and we can only use one room. So all 5 of us were crammed in to the smallest room she had, which was the size of a glorified closet space and didn't even fit a twin bed and a small dresser (so we lived out of trash bags and slept on the floor) for close to $1000 a month some months and still had to purchase all of our own food, despite her claiming my children on her foodstamps. She also had no bills outside of her land tax ($450 a year), electric and heating oil (which she hardly ever filled). So we were essentially paying her so she could do leisure activities. It was the worst 8 months of my life.  3 months ago my grandmother decided that she wanted to go to assisted living after a fall and transferred the deed of her house to me and basically said it was mine now. It is a 5 bedroom farmhouse. My boys insist on sharing a room so we have 2 extra bedrooms. Well, my SIL lost her house last month due to not paying her land tax for several years and asked if her and her step daughter could stay with us until they get enough money to move down south. I said sure, 1 bedroom, $800 a month and you have to buy and cook all your food separately because my daughter is vegan. She looked at me like I had 10 heads and said that she and her step daughter should not be made to share a room when there are 2 extra rooms and stated she cannot afford a rent of $800 while purchasing all of her own food on top of it. I said neither could we but we managed to cram 5 people in to a glorified closet space while you were getting $1000 and foodstamps. Take it or leave it. She decided to leave. Again, I am being told I am childish. AITA?",

        "selftext": "This has been causing a conflict with my entire family. And they think that I'm being selfish and unreasonable. Let me explain first. I M39 lost my son in 2019 due to a chronic heart condition. He was 15 years old. It was devastating and I just couldn't take it especially when my family did little to nothing to support me during these difficult times. They didn't bring my son meals when he was at the hospital. They didn't let me go home and rest even for a few hours. They didn't take care of other things while I had a lot to deal with I wasn't offered any help just words. They'd just talk but do nothing. Despite the struggle. I've created an account for my son's college fund and kept putting whatever I could get at the time and me and my son would talk about that a lot. He was depressed but always believed that he was going to get better and continue his education and attend college. I started saving money To keep him motivated and to make him feel like he could be like any other kid with hopes for a good future. He had a very close friend that's about the same age as him. They were friends for 5 years, and I can't express how his presence in my son's life helped him through the worst days, sometimes his friend would spend the night with us and try to get my son to do activities and lighten up his mood all the time. To be frank his friend was closer to him than his own family. He never stopped visiting and asking how I'm doing after my son's death. He'd show me handmade projects he made for my son and as a way to remember him and we'd sometimes just sit and talk together or cry together.  Last week. While I was with my family my sister asked me what I was going to do with my son's college money. I didn't wanna mention this but since she asked I told her that I will be giving the money to my son's friend. She barely even recognized his friend and was confused and said that my nephew deserves this money since he's family. My mom agreed that I wasn't thinking straight and that I should help the people close to me-family and that my nephew has a right to go to college and I was wrong for giving this opportunity away to someone else. I didn't know what to say they kept pointing out that I was making a mistake and how my nephew will resent me if he finds out. Thing is my nephew wasn't close to my son I don't even know why he'd be bothered. My sister went on about not being able to afford my nephew's college I told her this was my decision and I felt more comfortable that way. She started lashing out, constantly texting me constantly wanting to talk to me and ending up arguing. When I snapped she had my mom calling me basically guilttripping me and telling me I'm wrong and that I needed to think about this. It's just too much pressure and I'm feeling lost and unable to figure out how to deal with this.",

        "selftext": "I know I likely am, but the extend of which I'm unsure about.  My son is almost 17. This Christmas we bought him an expensive computer gaming chair, as he plays a lot of online multiplayer shooters. My son has some anger issues, which he's currently in therapy for, and these shooters tend to bring out his temper more than normal. However, for the past few months he's been keeping it together well, so I figured the chair might be a fair present.  I was wrong, because the day after Christmas he was gaming, started to have bad luck and apparently people in-game were fucking with him because he was losing his patience. This culminated in him screaming insults and then picking up his chair and slamming it into the ground, breaking the back of it. After talking him down, we had a very serious conversation about him no longer being allowed to play multiplayer games while under my roof until his therapist feels comfortable with his progress, talked about coping mechanisms, etc. However, I made it very clear this was unacceptable and he would be grounded. We've had these heart-to-hearts many times, so it's not like every time he has an outburst I'm making light of it. It's a serious issue and treated like such. However, when he came to me later that day and told me he'd like me to replace the chair because it was a gift, he really liked it and it would only be fair, the frustration, disbelief and disappointment in his behavior boiled over and I started laughing hysterically. As in a full laughing fit, barely able to breathe or talk. The more he'd plead his case, the harder I'd laugh, repeatedly asking him how it was fair in his mind to have me replace a gift I paid for that he broke in anger. This obviously pissed him off more, which led to him getting emotional, but I just couldn't seem to stop myself. I tried walking out of the room and asking him to drop it but every time he'd say but I need a chair! or What am I supposed to do now I'd laugh again. I tried explaining that I'm not laughing at his feelings, I'm laughing at how absurd it is for him as a teenager to expect me to replace shit he can't be bothered to treat with respect and then whine about it when he broke it. He's still pissed about it, and feels slighted. I feel bad for laughing, and honestly wonder if I had some sort of mini-stress break myself, because it's never happened before and I couldn't seem to stop. But at the same time, I stand by the fact that his request *was* ridiculous enough to make most people *want* to laugh. How badly did I fuck up?",

        "selftext": "I have a small group of close friends (all males around the age of 25) that I hang out with almost every day. We've all known each other almost all our lives and recently (~1.5 years) got a new addition to our group, John.  I never really liked John. He was rude, obnoxious, and would always talk like he knows everything. He was also incredibly pretentious. A friend of mine said Einstein once and John interrupted him to say, I have no idea who you are talking about. Do you mean the reknown scientist Albert EinSHTein?. I once put up a snapchat story saying, I love college football!, and he replied to my story with It's called gridiron you moron.  I don't understand how but my friends readily accepted him into our friends circle.  On one night about 5-6 months ago, we had a little get-together and were just drinking and having fun. John was kind of tipsy. We had some new girls show up so I was kinda working my charm on them. They asked me what I did and I went I'm a Biomed Engineer. I don't know why that triggered John so much, but he went on this hour long tirade about how I'm just a drone in a rat race. He kept telling me about how I'm just like every other person and lacked creativity. He later passed out, but his little tirade became a running joke in our group. Every time I mention work or anything, John would start roasting me. He nicknamed me 'drone' and kept calling me that even though I expressed multiple times that I dont like to be called a drone. He would keep telling me about how easy engineering is (he watched some intro to engineering courses online) and that any monkey with a brain can do what I do. That really pissed me off. Once I told him to shut the fuck up but he was like, What are you going to do, fight me? I dare you to swing. I didn't want to fight him so now I started getting referred to as a 'pussy'.  Over the last few months or so I kinda went frontpage a couple of times on Reddit and everyone was like, damn M0shka you famous now (as a joke). That triggered him even more. He'd say stuff like His posts suck. They're not even funny. Reddit is now just filled with stupid facebookers who upvote stupid clickbait shit and downvote meaningful talent.  At this point it is relevant to bring up what John does. He's a 'photographer' who works as a barista at Starbucks. How good is he? Honestly, he started off as an annoying kid with a DSLR, no talent, and a facebook page where he uploaded 3/10 pictures. Over the years he got slightly better but it's still terrible. I'd say he's more of a 5/10 now. 2 weeks ago, he got rejected from his dream job and made an Instagram post about how National Georgraphy discriminated him because of his skin color (brown).  Last week, we had a surprise birthday party at his place with his family (he lives with his parents) and friends. At the party, I apologized to him (I hadn't met him since the post) and said, I'm sorry you didn't get Nat Geo. To which he got angry again and said, I'd rather eat my own shit than be a drone like you. What I'm doing is making real art and it's something your robot brain won't ever understand now or in the future, so I actually feel sorry for you. He said stuff like this in front of a girl I was with who got so enraged that she left and told me to tell them that shes sick or something.  That's it. I fucking lost it. We were handing out mics to talk about our favorite memory with John and I took that opportunity to say, Well John, your pictures fucking suck, no wonder Nat Geo rejected you. You're a 27 year old barista with no college degree, mooching off your parents, and taking worse pictures than any jackass with an iPhone camera. You're not going to amount to anything in life so just --- *I get cut off here*  His dad grabbed the mic and shoved me. John came charging at me but everyone just held him back. The rest of the guys were like get him out of here, and I got kicked out. No one has talked to me since the incident and John blocked me from all social media. Our group chat has been pretty silent too. John also apparently made a roast post about me. Idk if I should apologize to him or not. Sorry for the long post. I know John is an asshole, but AITA? ",

We went out for about a year and it was alright but they were so emotionally invested in their channel that they constantly neglected me and made me feel like I wasn't a priority. Not really important why we broke up, but we broke up. Then I get a bunch of messages from friends about 3 months later telling me to go to their channel. I'm pretty much done with them but I do and I realise they made a video about me where they claim I was emotionally abusive. I continued to get messages from strangers telling me how awful a person I was and how they hoped I died through various means. So I sued my ex. It ruined them. I knew they were financially in a bad spot and they likely couldn't afford court fees but the case dragged. They made a video about not being able to afford court costs and such and how it was going to ruin them. After which a bunch of friends started telling me to just let it go and move on but I had sunk money into the case as well. It wasn't cheap for me either so I didn't just let it go. Eventually the judge ruled in my favor and I received a total of nothing from my ex...... But it meant I could link to the result in the comments section of every video she tried to frame me as the bad guy because in our state, court proceedings are public record. Suddenly her viewership dropped and she blamed me for ruining her life. A bunch of my friends said I went too far and should've just taken the court win and left her alone. Was I the asshole?",

        "selftext": "I\u2019m an author of mild success. I\u2019m not incredibly popular, but my books sell enough. About 3 months ago, someone from my old high school reached out to see if a student could interview me. I responded that my time at the school wasn\u2019t the happiest, but I would give the student responses relating to my career. We had a great chat. She started asking questions about my time at the school, but I redirected. She caught on to what I was doing and asked \u201cI\u2019m sensing that you\u2019re hesitant to talk about your time at (school). Is that true?\u201d I said let\u2019s focus on the story, and she was like \u201cActually this could be a better story.\u201d So I said y\u2019know what, sure. Whatever. I don\u2019t owe the school anything, I\u2019m not being paid, and even though it\u2019s been a long time and I\u2019ve grown from what happened, it\u2019s still worth talking about. I mentioned a few names in specific, and how I\u2019d tried to ask for help and was blown off by everyone. Teachers at my school very strongly favored the girls in sports teams, and would often be buddy buddy with them and their parents. I mentioned a teacher who openly mocked the way I dressed, my lack of athleticism, etc. I brought up the time that a group of girls followed me around the school mooing at me and when I broke down crying because they wouldn\u2019t stop and tried to tell a teacher, the teacher called me \u201cMoolly\u201d for the rest of the year and when I yelled \u201cMY NAME IS MOLLY. *MOLLY\u201d* she had me suspended for a week. She ended up publishing the whole interview. Nothing exactly went \u201cviral\u201d but there were posts on FB with a ton of comments and it caused some commotion in that community. A few weeks later, I was contacted by a school official who chastised me for bringing up old wounds and trying to paint veteran teachers as bad people when they were going through difficult times already. The teacher responsible for the \u201cMoolly\u201d incident had a local lifetime teaching award taken away from her after it all came out, so was it really worth it, and maybe did I remember things wrong? Finally, a handful of my old classmates (many of them stuck around town) found me and I was barraged with a ton of messages telling me that I\u2019m ruining the reputation of the school and of several prominent community members, it was X years ago so why can\u2019t I just get over it, etc. Some of them obviously haven\u2019t changed. It was a long time ago, yes. I don\u2019t know how I really feel about how this all went down though. I know times are tough for teachers right now. I didn\u2019t set out to hurt anyone, I was just telling my truth. AITA? **Edited:** So... I didn't expect this to be so overwhelmingly in favor of NTA. I wasn't looking for validation, but wow. Some of you are sending me heartbreaking stories of bullying and being ignored or gaslit, and I am so sorry. Thank you all for the responses. If the Mods want to take this down because of validation or whatever, please do. I have my answer. ",

I wanted to give them up but my parents told me not to.  For the first seven years of my boys\u2019 lives, I didn\u2019t act like a father and was more like a big brother (They knew I was their father though, but we never bonded like father-sons)  When I was ready to move out, I wanted to do it without them but my dad let me know it was my responsibility so I had to take them (I didn\u2019t want it at first but I\u2019m glad it happened) We started bonding as father-sons, I started loving them and their love for me increased I remember the three of us would seat on the couch to watch movies, one would sit on my left and one on my right while I wrapped my arms around them, they\u2019d put their heads on my chest and I often kissed their forehead. We\u2019ve been doing this since they were seven. I met my current wife, 5 years ago, (my kids were 15) we married 3 years ago after we welcomed our daughter (4F), she saw me doing this with my kids when we watched movies and she never said anything.  My kids are no longer living with us because they left for college, but they come to see me every now and then. My boys are 20 now but they still like to put their heads on my chest while I wrap my arms around them, they do it every time they visit and I\u2019m watching TV. My son, Liam visited me 2 weeks ago, he came out to me as gay and introduced me to his bf. I don\u2019t care how my kids live their sexuality or who they love, I love them no matter what, I just want them to be happy and I don\u2019t feel any different, and it doesn\u2019t make me feel uncomfortable to hug him or kiss his forehead, but it seems that my wife is a little uncomfortable.  My son visited me again last Wednesday (Since he was here 2 weeks ago, so the first time \u201cofficially out\u201d) I was watching \u201cRed\u201d with my daughter (she was on my left) then my son Liam arrived, he was tired and sat on my right, put his head on my shoulder while I wrap my arm around him, then I kissed his forehead and said, \u201cGood to have you back buddy\u201d.  We went to sleep and the next day my wife told me that It made her feel uncomfortable (me hugging and kissing my son) and asked me not to do it again while she doesn\u2019t mind me doing it with Lucas (my other son, straight) she doesn\u2019t want me to do it with Liam. I told her that she has no business being in my relationship with my sons, I also called her homophobic. She accused me of not treating her like an equal parent, (to my sons) thus I said that's  ok because you are not  My brother says I should understand because this is a big \u201cchange\u201d for her (a son coming out) but seriously think there is nothing to get \u201cused to\u201d this isn\u2019t neither her nor my problem who my son loves.

I knew my mom disliked weed so I warned her before she moved in that I would be smoking weed daily and would not stop for her. She agreed, and only asked that I smoke outside. Which I thought was a relatively reasonable request; weed has a strong smell and many people don't like it. At first this worked out fine at first.

As if I were still\u00a0 a child she could issue orders to. I refused and told her that she can move out if she doesn't like it. She started crying and saying that I don't love her, I have a problem, ect.\u00a0 The next day, I come home from work to find her waiting for me. She explained that she had flushed my weed (a little less than an ounce) for my own good. And then demanded that I go to treatment.\u00a0 Well, predictably, I was furious. And not even really about not having the weed anymore. It is pretty cheap (I usually buy ounces for $125) and I can easily get more. It was about her total lack of respect for me. I'm an adult, own my own house, have a good job, and have approval from the state to legally purchase and possess marijuana.\u00a0 So someone I'm doing a huge favor for demanding that I stop and throwing out my stuff when I refused is extremely outrageous to me. No matter if she pushed me out of her vagina 30 years ago. Anyway, we argued about this for a while and it became clear to me that she was not sorry at all and that she would probably do it again. So I told her she can't live with me anymore. I gave a month, but she has already packed all her shit and drove to my brothers house a couple hours away.\u00a0 She obviously thinks I'm a huge asshole. So does my brother. But I think that's mostly because she is his problem now.",

        "selftext": "Throwaway account, English is not my first language, I\u2019m on mobile - I apologise.  I (27F) have been married with my husband (M32) for three years and haven been dating for a little over 5. My husband has this friend (F31) \u2018Mary\u2019. They\u2019ve known each other since they were in high school and she\u2019s considered \u2018one of the boys\u2019, if you may. That basically means she\u2019s always invited to all the fishing trips and stuff, which I don\u2019t mind at all, I trust my husband.  Well, my problems with Mary started when she first found out I\u2019m half Romanian. It started kinda innocently, with her asking me to say certain words, teach her some insults etc which didn\u2019t necessarily bother me, but it usually put me on the spot whenever we were out with my husband\u2019s group of friends. It only escalated to her googling stuff about Romania and asking me \u2018are you a vampire? do you bite your husband by the neck?\u2019 to \u2018are you a gypsy? I bet you\u2019ve got some of that gypsy blood in you\u2019 (which is just blatantly racist) Last week, me and my husband organised a mini BBQ with our friends and Mary was invited by my husband despite me telling him she makes me uncomfortable. He said he had talked to her about her remarks and she\u2019s been understanding so it\u2019s unlikely she\u2019ll say something this time. It was midnight and there were about 4 of us left and I accidentally spilled some red wine on Mary\u2019s jeans when I tripped over a carpet. All hell broke loose. Mary started saying that I\u2019m a witch and I\u2019m trying to ruin her life and this whole thing is part of my ritual and I\u2019m just a \u2018immigrant gypsy trying to ruin my husband\u2019s life\u2019 and I\u2019ve poisoned my husband against her. I started crying and profusely apologising. When she wouldn\u2019t drop it, I kicked her out and banned her from ever coming to my house again.  AITA for doing this? My husband insists that Mary was just drunk and talking nonsense and he would talk to her. He also told me I\u2019m way too sensitive about my heritage and I\u2019m an a-hole for banning her. Mary has since given me a half hearted apology but I\u2019m still not ok with her. EDIT: I guess this is the update some of you wanted. Sorry I\u2019m still a mess and idk how coherent I am. We\u2019ve talked. He admitted to being in and out of an affair with Mary in the first 2y of our relationship and she wanted to win him back I guess. I called my mom to come help me pack some stuff and im out. Thats it. Mary can have him I\u2019ve been gaslit for years and it took a reddit post to realise. Oh the irony. thank you reddit. EDIT2 and probably the last one for a period of time:   A lot of people seemed suspicious of Mary and my husband\u2019s friendship/relationship etc and have asked if I ever suspected anything. No, I didn\u2019t. Me and my husband had (or I thought we had) a very strong relationship, based on communication and honesty (guess it only applied to me). Also, Mary is very close with all the boys in the said friendship group. The other wives raised concerns in the past but they\u2019ve all been shut down by the boys in the group or by Mary herself. I guess I always respected their friendship group because they were very close for so long and it felt unfair to change that because of me. As far as I\u2019m aware, the other wives feel the same - plus Mary has been in a LD relationship for about 2 years and always claimed she\u2019s focusing on her career, she\u2019s too busy etc so none of us ever saw her as a potential threat.   But now it just makes me think there could be more to this story. But I\u2019m tired, as of right now, I am just exhausted. My Romanian witch blood won\u2019t let me live until I find out the whole truth but I need time.  Thank you to everyone who took the time to reply to my post, message me (even the ones that insulted me further - it was semi-funny) and thank you for the awards! I\u2019m sending virtual hugs to all of you! Ave\u021bi grij\u0103 de voi!",

        "selftext": "For some reason my 14 year old son cannot wipe properly.  This was never a concern to me as his mom did the laundry.   Unfortunately she is sick right now so I have taken over the household chores that she used to handle.  My son is still responsible for his and I do mine as well as hers.   First day I did laundry I gagged and almost puked from his underwear.  If he were three and not fully potty trained I might understand how they end up like this.  But he is a healthy young man.  He should not be leaving his ass this unwiped.   I talked to him about it and he said he would make an effort to do a better job.  Nope. No change in the situation.  So I went to the hardware store and installed a wand bidet in the bathroom he uses.  We already have one in ours.  I told him that he has a choice of either using the bidet or washing his own underwear.  He doesn't know how to use the washing machine and he refuses to do them by hand.  He started going commando.  Which just meant the problem was his jeans now.   So I said that we might need to take him to the doctor to see what is wrong with him.  If it's physical or psychological.  I also said that the next time his friends were over I was going to ask them is they left their underwear in the same condition.  I WOULD NEVER ACTUALLY EMBARRASS HIM LIKE THAT. He said I was being an asshole and he called his mom to tell her what I was doing.  She said that he was just like that and I could deal with it until she was better.   I don't think that's a great plan.  If this kid never learns to wipe his ass he will be bereft of a sexual partner without a poop fetish.  I'm not kinkshaming him if that's his thing.   He has started using the bidet but he says that it is gross and weird.  I said it was grosser and weirder for a 14 year old to crap his pants every day.  We are both stressed about his mom but this situation isn't because of her. I asked her.",

        "selftext": "I (21f) have a brother (28) who came out as gay last month. He has been married to my best friend's big sister (24) for four years, they have 2yo twin daughters together. I'm really close with her, so I've been trying to stay neutral in what has become a messy separation.  My brother told his wife he's gay by sitting her down, and saying he had been sleeping with two different men for about six months. He said he is now sure that he feels romantic feelings for men, and also told her he has been sleeping with random men from Grindr for over a year behind her back. She obviously freaked out, asked him how he could do this, why didn't he tell her when he started having the feelings, etc. He said that he's always thought he was gay but he didn't want to come out because it might affect his career. She asked him what about the effect on her life? She is now a single mother to two toddlers. He was essentially very angry that she wasn't supportive of this, so he kicked her out of the house, with the kids. After she eventually found a place to stay, my brother moved in one of the men he has been having an affair with.  Since then, he has had very little contact with the kids, as in speaking to them on the phone once a week maybe. He has expressed that he still doesn't want to be public about coming out, so he posted on Facebook that he has separated from his wife because they aren't in love anymore and hinted SHE was the unfaithful one (posting things like 'yeah, seems like someone in this relationship wasn't satisfied with just one man') and is basically being a dick. I told him a couple weeks ago that he's a fucking asshole and I don't want to be involved with him anymore because I think it's disgusting that he's treated his wife like this. I told him I get that you have to come out in your own time, but you don't need to kick her out, ignore your kids and berate her, and you don't need to make comments that people will assume mean she was being unfaithful (he said this was a joke about him having two partners now? still fucked up). He said I'm being a homophobic asshole, and that I don't know how hard it is to come out. He said that if I don't accept him, I'm a bigot. He made mistakes and what not. I said maybe I will forgive him if he improves his behaviour to his wife, and he said he resents her for keeping him from sleeping with men for years. I gave up at this point. My sisters (17&24) both think I'm being homophobic, my mom agrees with me. AITA?",

        "selftext": "Okay, throwaway because my boyfriend knows my other account.  I (23f) moved in with my boyfriend (24m) of two years a couple months ago. We haven\u2019t had any problems before this argument. Things had been going pretty well.  Anyways, a couple days ago, I got my period. It came early and I had ran out of pads. I couldn\u2019t leave to buy some because I bleed pretty heavily and I would\u2019ve bled through my pants. So I asked my boyfriend if he could buy pads for me from the drugstore, because it was late. He immediately said no. I was shocked because I wasn\u2019t really expecting that.  I asked him why. He said that he didn\u2019t want the cashier to see him buying pads. At this point I started laughing because that was hilarious. He wasn\u2019t joking though. He just glared at me. I told him that the cashier would obviously know it wasn\u2019t for him. Plus, the cashier would definitely not care what he was buying. He still refused. I told him that he could go to the self checkout machine if he was so insecure, but he said that he didn\u2019t want anyone to see him with the pads because they\u2019d think he was a \u201ctr***y\u201d. I told him that he was childish, and that his masculinity was really fragile if he couldn\u2019t even buy pads for his own girlfriend. He got mad and went out. I had to bunch up toilet paper as a makeshift pad, wear black pants and a long cardigan and go buy the pads myself. My boyfriend has been ignoring me ever since. I\u2019ve been thinking that maybe I might\u2019ve pushed it too far. So AITA for telling my boyfriend that his masculinity was fragile after he refused to buy pads for me? *Edit*: *Wow, thank you for all your replies! I\u2019m definitely going to have a serious talk with my boyfriend in the morning about this and we\u2019ll see how it goes* **UPDATE**: First off, thank you for all your awards, replies and stories, they all mean so much to me. I confronted my boyfriend an hour ago. We sat down together and I told him that I didn\u2019t like how he acted about buying pads for me. He said that he didn\u2019t feel like he had to, and that I could\u2019ve \u201cheld it in\u201d and drove to the drugstore to get the pads myself. I told him that you can\u2019t \u201chold in\u201d menstrual blood, but he insisted that I could\u2019ve done it for a few minutes and that it wouldn\u2019t be a big deal. We went back and forth over this so I just dropped it.  I asked him (like most of you mentioned) what would happen when we have kids and he\u2019d have to take care of me and buy me nipple cream, take me to the washroom, etc. He said that I would not need those things because I should be able to do them on my own after giving birth. He said that there wasn\u2019t anything hard about using the bathroom and the only reason I\u2019d need help is if I was a \u201ccripple\u201d. Then I asked him about the tr***y comment. He said that he didn\u2019t understand why people would want to change the gender they were born in. That basically cemented everything for me. I felt completely betrayed and humiliated.  I can\u2019t believe I spent two years of my life with a guy who holds these views, and I can\u2019t believe I was too oblivious to it. I just feel so dumb. I told him that we need to break up. He cussed at me and told me that I was exaggerating and that I was being a bitch. I told him that I would send him my half of this month\u2019s rent (we live together but it was his appartement so we would split the bill). Then I packed my bags and drove to my parents house without saying another word. I\u2019m gonna be staying with my parents until I sort myself out. I\u2019m feeling really down right now, because I really did love him, but I also feel relieved. Again, thank you all for helping me out, and sending me encouraging messages. I appreciate it all.",

I have always struggled with my hair and was adopted into a family of people with straight hair who couldnt care for my hair properly leading to huge knots and regularly get my hair massacred by scissors to make it short to be easier to deal with. When i went to uni i met my best friend who is black and has a similar hair type to me and when noticing my struggle helped me out. She showed me hair products from brands intended for black people that really helped with my hair quality and even took me to the salon she went to that catered for black hair types. My hair has been amazing ever since, theyve been the only people to understand how to care for my hair and make it look nice.  Well onto the actual argument, me and some friends from work went out for dinner and we were talking about our hair and i commented that i go to a salon that specialises in black haircare. One of the women ( also white) commented that it was inappropriate for me as a white woman to take advantage of black products and services that should only be used by black people. When i asked why she said that its kind of cultural appropriation. The others there agreed with her and i felt uncomfortable ever since. I dont know if she is right and if i am in the wrong, i dont even know what id do if it was wrong as i dont want to go back to the salons that butchered my hair before.",

She was in class and suddenly felt like she was going to vomit so she tried to run to the bathroom. She didn\u2019t make it and vomited in the hallway. However she was sent to the office for running out of class without permission. The principal called me about this and I had to come in. He told me that she was being punished and was losing her privileges to go on the field trip the next week. I told him that was insane considering she did it because she was trying to keep from making a mess and she\u2019s 7! She made a snap judgement that I think most people would make. On top of that, they sent her to the principal instead of the nurse. He refused to change the decision so I took my daughter out of school for the last 2 days of the week. Since she was missing the field trip I wanted her to have as much fun as possible so we went to an amusement park, the movies, and to paint pottery. She told her father about this during his visitation time and he got very angry at me for undermining the principal. AITA?",

        "selftext": "That\u2019s the actual quote. I\u2019m still pissed as hell but maybe I went too far here.  My brother and I are both late 30s. We get along fine most of the time, but my brother doesn\u2019t do well in a lot of social situations. He says things that are inappropriate, gets overly opinionated, yells a lot etc.  He just doesn\u2019t seem to understand tact or when to let things go in a casual conversation.  Our wives are best friends. They talk almost everyday on FaceTime.  My wife is an ex model/actress (local) and very good with makeup.  She\u2019s in her mid 30\u2019s, we have 3 kids and she doesn\u2019t wear much makeup anymore - but she got some as a gift for Christmas and decided she wanted to get more. Apparently she\u2019s been buying cheap stuff and she wanted to splurge on some good shit.  Anyway, she\u2019s been testing it all out over the last month, buying more here and there and doing these crazy eyeshadow things - honestly I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m talking about. She looks great all the time. She\u2019s gorgeous without makeup. She\u2019s really talented with it though and she\u2019s having a lot of fun. I tease her a little since she works from home and she\u2019s wearing pajamas but her makeup looks like she\u2019s at a nightclub. I think it\u2019s cute and funny.  My brother thinks she\u2019s doing it because she\u2019s cheating or she wants to cheat. He called me this morning to say he\u2019s concerned because he\u2019s seen her on FaceTime and he\u2019s decided she must be posting pictures or sending pics to some dude or multiple dudes. I tried to blow it off and explain that it wasn\u2019t that way, but he got more aggressive about it so I ended up yelling at him and shouting the insecure testicle man baby thing.  He\u2019s being ridiculous and needs to mind his own business. But I think I might be the asshole for blowing up and name calling when he\u2019s probably well intentioned.  I want to add too (my mom and brother both asked, maybe other people will):  No, I haven\u2019t asked my wife why she\u2019s recently starting wearing more makeup and I\u2019m not going to because I think asking is fucking rude.  She\u2019s spending her money on stuff for her face and it\u2019s a creative hobby. I\u2019m not going to be the dick that ruins someone\u2019s creative outlet by asking them to justify it or by insinuating there\u2019s a sinister motive behind it.

        "selftext": "So I'm an engineer and I'm working on a team with 7 decently chill guys and one guy with anger issues. Like he can't just have a respectful disagreement, he'll raise his voice and yell and get up close to your face. I hate it. So I started by just complaining to my boss about it. And he brushed it under the rug saying he is just like that. And if I thought he was bad now I should of seen him 10 years ago before he mellowed out  It makes me wonder what he was like 10 years ago because he sure ain't mellow now.  It's also a small enough company that there's no HR, only the corporate management. Which didn't help.  So I took a different approach. I stopped calling him angry, or calling what he was doing arguing or yelling. I just swapped in the words emotional or throwing a tantrum or having a fit I was kinda hoping if I could shift his reputation from domineering (big man vibes) to emotional and tantrumming (weak sad baby vibes)  So I started just making subtle comments. Like if I had a meeting with him and he got a temper, I'd mention to the other people Wow, it's crazy how emotional Jay got. I dunno how he has the energy to throw a hissy fit at 9 am, I'm barely awake  Or when my boss asked me to recap a meeting he missed, I told him Dan, Jack, and James had some really great feedback on my report for (this client). Jay kinda had trouble managing his emotions and had a temper tantrum again, but you know how he gets.  Or when a coworker asked why he was yelling I'd say Honestly I don't even know, he was getting so emotional about it he wasn't speaking rationally.  I tried to drop it in subtly and some of my coworkers started picking it up. I don't think consciously, just saying stuff like Oh, another of Jay's fits or something. I got gutsy enough to even start saying to his face Hey, I can hardly understand what you're trying to explain when you're so emotional And again my coworkers started picking up on it and I even caught several of them telling him to get a hold of himself. After a while, he started to get a reputation as emotional and irrational. Which I could tell pissed him off. But he stopped yelling at me as much.  Anyway, he slipped once this week and I just said I really can't talk to you when you're being this emotional and he blew up at me asking why I was always calling him that. I shrugged and said dude you look like you're on the verge of tears, go look in the mirror before you ask me and he got really angry I suggested he might start crying. (That was a kinda flippant comment, he was red faced angry not tearful angry, and I could tell.)  I feel like a bit of a dick for being petty and trying to gaslight this guy into thinking everyone around him sees him like a crybaby.

        "selftext": "I go to college in New York state. I am Muslim. I was very young when 9/11 happened, as were the rest of the people in my year. There's a girl in one of my classes who's father was in the World Trade Center. He died. Of course, this is very sad, and I pity the man, but not her. She's extremely racist. She hates everyone who isn't white or east asian. But she especially hates Muslims due to her father's passing. So of course, we don't talk. But today, September 11, was the day she exploded. I was wearing a hijab. She told me I should take it off out of respect for the victims and that it was the equivalent of a hat. I said no.  She said that you Muslims did this, you need to take off the hijab to show respect.  I obviously told her no. Then she went on a very long Islamophobic rant that I can't entirely recall because this was hours ago. But I remember she concluded by saying that Islam took away her father, so she wants to take away Islam. (I'm still confused as to what she meant.) She made a few comments towards me, and I went on my phone to de escalate. She made more comments, I kept ignoring her. But then she said Yeah, you're not responding because you know I'm right. I don't know why that set me off, but it did.  I told her No, I'm just busy texting my DAD. She left the room in tears. My classmates are saying that she was in the wrong, but what I said was unnecessarily cruel. Now, I don't think I'm TA, bc she started it, all I did was finish it. So, reddit, AITA?? Yes, I am aware I have spelling mistakes. I speak Arabic at home. EDIT: For everyone wondering, the professor was out of the room. He'd already given us our lecture.",

I felt like I was going crazy because my husband is the only one who has access to the bedroom and he doesn't usually touch nor come near my things. I figured it must be his mom walking in and snooping on my personal things. I told my husband and he said his mom would never...I had a huge hunch but couldn't instal a cam in the bedroom to catch her in act. So, I got me one of those fake postive pregnancy tests and threw it in the bedroom's trashcan. note the trashcan was placed in the corner near the closet.  Literally the next day after I got to work, I got tons of calls and texts from my inlaws congratulating me for my pregnancy. My husband came over to my workplace and was all worked up about it asking since when I was pregnant, and why I didn't tell him. I asked how he found out and he said his mom found the positive test in the trashcan in the bedroom. I asked if his answer just confirmed that she's been snooping in the bedroom all along. He had a realization moment but demanded we stick to the bigger issue, I said there was no bigger issue because the positive test was fake and this whole thing was done to expose my MIL's snooping. he was not convinced. he had me take an actual test right infront of him and he was livid asking how could I lie about such thing and break his mom's heart since I know...very well that she longs for kids. I got a lot of shit because of this from him, his mom and family now calling me a liar and manipulator. AITA? important info: nothing gets takes or goes missing from the bedroom. just to be clear.",

        "selftext": "I (20m) has two younger siblings, Joe and Jill. They're twins, both 18 and graduating high school this year. Jill is my parent's favorite, because they've always wanted a daughter, while Joe is their scapegoat, because I guess he's the bonus baby they never actually asked for. I'm mostly better off than Joe, as I'm the oldest grandson from both sides of my family, almost all of whom are just as blantant as my parents are about their favoritism. I felt really bad for Joe, so I did what I could to make him feel less alone. Like when Jill got to go shopping with mommy and daddy, I took Joe skating with my friends. When our parents were too busy watching Jill's kiddie pageant, I dragged my best bud to sit through Joe's elementary school musical. Small things like that. It all started as pity moves, but soon my friends pretty much like Joe better than me, while Jill's princess syndrome got in her head, so now I spend more time with Joe because I simply like him better than Jill. Never said it out loud, but I don't make it a secret either that I prefer not to spend my time with entitled brats. Anyway, like I said they're graduating soon. They both already had their choice of college, accomodations, etc. Jill's going to a uni in SF, fully funded by our parents, unsurprisingly. Joe's going to the same Uni as mine in Seattle, but different campus just 20ish minutes away. He got a full ride, which apparently makes him ineligible to get any financial help from his own parents. This is also hardly surprising, so I made some calls to ask around, see if anyone is hiring next fall. I did this while on facetime with Joe. I was reassuring him that we'll find him a job that don't suck and pays enough, that he's better off without dad's money anyway because we both know it comes with strings attached, that this way, mom and dad wouldn't be able to stick their noses into his purchases. I got him to feel better about the whole thing and logged off. I guess Jill overheard, because the next day she sent me texts after texts demanding I help her find jobs as well because she doesn't want dad nagging her. When I told her, politely btw, that I don't know anyone in SF, and that she'd get more help from mom and dad, she blew up, saying all these things about me favoring Joe over her, which, yeah. It's true. I love both of my siblings, but I don't particularly like Jill. It's not like she's making herself likeable, though, so AITA?",

The stipulations were continuing good grades, good attitude, she could only bring one friend with her somewhere (to begin with), we had to know where she was, and the obvious two: don't drink & drive, and don't text and drive.  We made it clear that **we** were buying the car, but it was for her to use. We got the car, a 2012 Honda Civic. She has a summer job right now, it's summer break so she's out doing stuff with her friends, etc. In a few months she will be off to college. Everything was going swimmingly. Until someone on that NextDoor app started posting pictures and videos of bad drivers in the area. And lo and behold, my daughter was posted with her face down as she texted and rolled through a stop sign. Once with her face down in her phone at a stoplight. I was livid. My wife was the one who showed it to me. We found out there were more instances (from her Instagram Stories) and we decided... no. Wife and I up and sold the car. We didn't lose very much in the process, except of course our daughter completely came unraveled. It's so unfair, I didn't hurt anyone, everyone's doing it, how am I supposed to get to work, what about when I go to college? Well, we said no, it's not unfair, you hurt us by being a shitty, irresponsible driver, no, not everyone's doing it, you can walk, ride your bike, or take the bus, and as for college, you don't need the car to get to and from classes, and again, ride your bike or walk. She tried to play the how can you send your daughter to college without her safety in mind? card and I said Well, well, well, now you're concerned about safety? and she just up and screamed.  This has everyone in our life up in arms and divided. Her grandparents think we're being over the top and awful, that grounding her would have sufficed. They've threatened that THEY will buy her a car again if we try to send her to college without one.  The car is already sold, so there's no going back. I think what we did was absolutely correct, that actions have consequences and we would be in the wrong to pull back from that. In terms of her going to college? Well, she made that choice. She had a car, it came with certain stipulations, she disobeyed us, and now she pays the price.  So AITA?",

But turns out they also invited her husband\u2019s side of the family.  When it was time to get in the pool, I changed into my swim trunks and removed my shirt. But my sister stopped me before I came out their house and asked to keep my shirt on because of my scars. She was referring to the scars from when I had my top (chest) surgery. I\u2019m a trans guy. Had started transitioning 8 yrs ago and my surgery was 4 years ago. My scars have already faded and they\u2019re pretty well hidden under my pecs. You\u2019d have to look really close to even notice.  I\u2019ve been to their pool many times and she\u2019s never said anything before so I was surprised. Every other guy including my dad were all shirtless in the pool.  When I asked what the prob was with my scars she said she was uncomfortable with her in laws knowing I\u2019m trans. My feelings were hurt but I was mainly pissed. She said she didn\u2019t want her in laws to look at her differently if they found out about me.  She told me not to make a big deal and to go with it.  When she left, I went back inside to change because i wasn\u2019t gonna go in the pool with a shirt on. I only had the one I came wearing because I didn\u2019t expect her to ask me this.  My mood was soured after that and I didn\u2019t wanna be around her so I decided to leave. When I said bye to everyone they were all confused since I was only there less than an hour. My dad pulled me aside and asked why I was leaving early.  I told him to ask my sister and left. An hour later my sister called me upset because she and my dad got into a fight.  My parents were furious about what she told me and they ended up leaving early too. Now she\u2019s angry at me for ruining the bbq and said I didn\u2019t have to cause all this drama if I only did what she asked. What she said hurt me and I was no longer in a mood to be around her or anyone else, but I didn\u2019t mean for all that to happen.

My ex husband's girlfriend tried to get involved in my parenting several times, she even commented on my son's name implying that we should agree on a name we all want not just what I wanted, and tried to dictate what he should and shouldn't have. As a result she started throwing stuff of his that I paid for myself. Honestly it's frustrating because I'm barely getting by with the money I have and can not afford to buy replacement for all the stuff she throws put but my ex husband says it's her house and she gets to decide what can and can't enter. I made a crochet blanket for my son with his name on it. This blanket is special to me, and the tools I used to be able to make it cost me money. Not to mention the time and effort it took to get it down. I sent my son to stay with his dad days ago, and he wanted to take the blanket with him to sleep with it. I don't know exactly what happened, but when I came to pick him up he told me his dad's girlfriend took it away from him and threw it out leaving him with no blanket to sleep with at night as punishment for him for not accepting the one she offered. I was furious. I called his dad but he hung up on me, I sent him a text explaining the situation, but he texted back telling me that I should stop the drama and go look for a job if I have so much free time on my hand instead of picking on his girlfriend. I felt frustrated I visited his family who are good to me and told them about what their son's girlfriend did, now it's worth mentioning that she's been working hard for their approval and to get on their good side. They were shocked to know about what she did they all flipped out on her and started calling her out. My SIL took it further by putting this on social media which made other family members see what she did. My ex husband called me yelling about my pathetic attempt to turn his family against his girlfriend. I could hear her freaking out in the background while he was lashing out at me saying I ruined every chance she had to have a good relationship with her future inlaws. I hung up and felt absolutely horrible, even though I was just venting to his family about what happened and felt frustrated. Maybe I shouldn't have told them?

        "selftext": "My biological family is dead. I was raised in foster care, and so my friends are my family. I met my late husband in college. He was just raised by his mother, who had abandoned him and later died (no adoptive family). As an adult, I've looked into both trees and our biological ancestors are, to put it mildly, really dangerous people and/or dead. My late husband and older son died in a car crash. My daughter is in kindergarten and she, more accurately me, was supposed to do a family tree project for school. I tried speaking to her teacher that this was not going to be a Pollyanna report, but she is one of those people that can't comprehend that sometimes family is a dark subject, and insisted that it needed to be biological. So, I did it. Some of them, like her father and my son, I have actual information for aside from that they're dead. But for most of my family and her paternal family, I literally only have birth date, death date, when they would have had their kids, and cemetery information, unless they were cremated. It was supposed to have 10 pictures, but most of the pictures I have of any ancestors are just headstones. I made a trip when my husband and I first married to take pictures of the headstones, so I included those in there. I only have 3 pictures total of my biological family, and most of them are group shots where I could only label maybe 3 people. I don't have any pictures of my late husband's family from before me and my kids, but I put some of the old ones in there too. So while the other kids had long family trees, my daughter was basically introducing the concept of death to her kindergarten class. Now I'm getting slammed with calls from other parents, the teacher, and the principal. They're appalled that I allowed such a morbid report and are saying I traumatized their children. I don't think I did anything wrong. They wanted a report on her biological ancestors, I gave it, and kept it G-rated. I just didn't lie that people were alive when they weren't. I don't raise her to think that death is taboo or something to be ashamed of anyway. Death is part of life. Most of her/my family is dead, so talking about family just means talking about death, and it's just something you have to accept. AITA?",

        "selftext": "About two months ago, my husband and I got \u201cmarried\u201d in a beautiful ceremony. It was SO MUCH FUN. We went on a honeymoon after. The price tag makes me wheeze, but my parents were insistent on paying for 95% of it, saying it\u2019s their only daughter\u2019s wedding. As a result, the wedding was way more fancy than something my husband or I could afford! My husband and I paid the rest \u2014 his family did not contribute (which is fine!).  The wedding was lovely, but missing one piece - the marriage license. About a year and a half ago, I was going through some serious health issues (the issues are resolved now, thankfully!). I had recently graduated from school and didn\u2019t have health insurance. My husband and I decided to get married so I could join his health insurance. It was a quick Justice of the Peace ceremony. We were always planning to have a ceremony at some point in the future. A few months after that, he \u201cproposed\u201d (something I didn\u2019t see coming!), the wedding occurred, and here we are today, planning for kids.  Very few people knew we got legally married about a year and a half ago. We weren\u2019t trying to be deceptive. However, part of it was that I wasn\u2019t comfortable revealing my health issues. My husband respected this. My parents knew about our legal marriage, but his mother did not. His mom (I\u2019ll call her Carol) and I aren\u2019t close. She\u2019s fine enough in low doses, but... We\u2019re currently in the process of moving. This past weekend, his mother came to help us pack up things. As we were packing files (birth certificate, social security cards, etc.), somehow our marriage license must\u2019ve slipped out. Carol picked it up and kept insisting we need to frame it. And then she noticed the date.  Carol lost it. She insisted we lied to everyone. She said our wedding ceremony was just a \u201cgift grab\u201d (our wedding website stated that someone\u2019s presence was gift enough\u2014 we still got many generous gifts and we are forever grateful). Carol went and called her twin sister, my husband\u2019s aunt, and the sister called and lashed out at us. She said we were sneaky and deceptive. She is saying she may want her gift back\u2014something we are fine with giving her.  For me and my husband, the legal wedding was just so I could get insurance. A means to an end. Our wedding date is what we will celebrate. Are we assholes for not being more upfront? I\u2019ve been really upset and confused and waffle back and forth. My husband insists we are not assholes.",

        "selftext": "Throwaway because I don't want my family tracking this back to my main. My sister got knocked up by her boyfriend right out of highschool, got married the next year, then proceeded to pop out another baby every year or two, so she has four now at 24. She's a stay at home mom even though she was brilliant and could have gotten a free ride to a great University. Since hers are the only grandkids, our parents fawn over her like she's the next coming of Christ. They gush over over every new tooth or haircut like it's some huge achievement. Problem is, her husband's business wasn't great even even before COVID, and is barely limping along now. Sister doesn't work, and my parents have limited income. So guess who's constantly being told to lend them money for shit like school fees, car seat, car payment, new  stroller, etc. They don't even ask! My mom just texts me your sister needs $X.XX for the kids and I'm supposed to cough up. If I complain, they accuse me of being  jealous because I don't have a husband and family even though I'm older (I'm only 26!) So over Easter I notice my sister isn't drinking and I think oh god, here we go again. Sure enough, she stands up and announces that she's been inseminated with yet another precious miracle.  Everyone's gushing and I just try to stay quiet and out of the way.  Later she asks me if everything's alright and I try to play it off but she pushes so I asked her if she and her husband could really afford another baby. She very snippily replies God will provide like he has so far, which really pissed me off. I yelled that no, actually god didn't provide for her babies, **I** did, and I wasn't going to giving them any more handouts. It devolved into a big argument with everyone shouting at me, and basically I've been banned from my family unless I apologize. I haven't apologized.  It's been radio silence except for one text from my mom saying that if my sister miscarries it's my fault for stressing her out. I asked if my sister was showing any symptoms but no one will answer or tell me. IDK. I don't think I'm TA but I don't want to be the reason she miscarries. Also, I think I might be TA because secretly I think it would be better if she did even though I wouldn't say that to her.",

        "selftext": " My biological (12yo) daughter ~ Susan likes to collect and read old children's books. She's become incredible reader. She had problems with reading and learning before and we were advised to encourage her to read and eversince she started reading (which she does regularly) her skills improved. she also reads to her 2yo sister everynight. I have a (16yo), stepson ~ Levi who can be a hothead sometimes. We don't have a son~dad relationship but I respect him and he respects me though he can act quite mean and selfish towards me and his sisters. He'd throw away stuff that belongs to us over small arguments and teases Susan for spending a lot of time to read calling her grandma. My wife and I discussed his behavior and had conversations and agreed on punishments but Levi'd go to his dad's place whenever he causes troubles then have his dad yell at me for wanting to discuss a suitable punishment. Then Levi comes home days later expecting me to let go of what he did everytime, it's frustrating. I got a call at work from Susan saying Levi took her entire book collection and threw them in the pool after she refused to lend him and his friends her camera for his trip. My wife helped get them out but they were wet and some were torn. It was horrific because some of those books are hard to get and meant a lot to Susan as a part of her life.I was so mad at Levi I came home to have a conversation with my wife to decide on a punishment but he already packed a small bag and went to his dad's, I asked my wife how could she let him basically run after doing this and she said he called his dad and he came to pick him up after Susan said that I was coming home to deal with the problem. I went to his dad's house and he refused to let me see him. I told him how Levi was hiding from consequences and his dad tried to justify why Levi was acting out by blaming me for how me and Susan treat him. He even said he'd get CPS involved if I ever try to punish him because I'm not his dad, I have no right. Adding what Levi did was a reaction to my daughter being mean to him. He told me to leave because Levi won't come home til I promise not to do anything about what he did and put it in writing. I told him Levi should stay there with him then. He's not to come back til ~he~ get proper punishment.His dad argued it's his mom's house too and called my wife and she asked to let this go and we'll figure out some way to resolve it but I don't think it's fair for Susan to have her books ruined and Levi getting away with it. They're asking me to let it go but this will only encourage Levi to do worse if I don't deal with it now.It's been 2 weeks and my in-laws say I was out of line for banning Levi from coming home and are telling me to step back but I refused. EDIT ~ Levi's dad thinks that because I'm not his bio dad then I have no right to punish him for whatever he does in the house. In the past his dad caused issues when I used to take Levi's electronics (that his dad bought) as punishment. Then I got talked out of punishing him everytime he did something unacceptable wether to me or his sisters. I've arranged for family therapy but Levi's dad refused to let him go. EDIT ~ I'd like to mention that my inlaws said that Levi is willing to apologize to Susan and so this should be enough to get this over with but I kept saying no and for that I'm being considered at fault.",

This acc is just for privacy reasons -I always had good grades in high-school, was home on time, cleaned the house etc. I never had problems with my parents before this.  -I went to med school, still living with parents when I was 20, I dated someone who was 23 -Dad was against this because be does not believe in dating people far older than you (so like don't date far from your own age)  and says I cannot date J.  -Argument breaks out, Dad says it's his house so either I agree or I move out. I say it's not fair as J has a job, goes to college, has future plans etc. Dad kicks me out. Mom agrees with his decision. Little bro was only 14 at the time.  -I moved with J, his family was supportive, helped me with my college (I went to another college due to financial reasons), finished my required years but still kept in touch with my lil bro -Years later, me and J (with the help of his parents) got a small house. (Like really small but I'm happy with it). I ended up giving birth to a sweet baby girl. I let my lil bro know that he could come see her when he was able to.  He came a few times.  -Today, bro came to see the baby, and asked when I was going to let mom and dad see her since they wanted to reconnect. I said never and that I wasn't going to forgive them. Bro says I'm being unreasonable as they were just strict and trying to protect me, I say that's bullshit because Dad shouldn't have kicked me out over age. Bro says I should at least let Mom come because she didn't want to agree with it. I say Mom was able to do something but didn't,but that Bro's situation was different because he was only 15. Bro is upset because he says Mom and Dad regret their decision and just want to reconnect and that I am dragging this entire situation. I told him that if he thinks I'm 'dragging it out' then he can stay out of my life too. He's angry and says that I need to move on and that I shouldn't be withholding them from seeing THEIR grandchild. I say that THEY disowned me and so have no grandchild from a daughter that doesn't exist.  AITA? I don't hate my bro and I (kinda)  get what he is saying, but I just have a resentment for my parents. It's not like I had a baby just to put it against them,  but my lil bro thinks I'm going go die on a hill with them for something done several years ago and it's petty. I'm curious on what reddit thinks. I want a relationship with my bro, just not my mom and dad",

        "selftext": "I am in college and my roommate from last year, Meg, who's family is really rich, said she could bring a friend on vacation. It was kinda awkward, I was her third choice but her family vetoed the first two because they didn't want her bringing a boy or this other female friend of hers they disliked. Her parents bought my plane ticket and booked the resort which I was very grateful for and I saved a lot of money up so I could make sure I buy my own food and activities when I'm there, and treat her family to a dinner as a thank you for the ticket. But when the trip started, it was just bad. It was her, me, her mother, her father, two of her father's friends, and her three brothers going.  On the flight, they all got first class and got me a economy seat. But I didn't say anything because why argue about a free ticket? The first night they went to a grocery, it turns out they wanted to cook at the resort kitchen for the whole trip  And by they wanted to cook it actually turned out that they wanted me and Meg to cook. I wasn't warned about this but it turns out Meg's family is sooo traditional that they see cooking as a women's job. And her mom had just had hand surgery. So it was me and Meg cooking every meal for six men and her mom. And I can't cook well. I know a couple staple meals to feed myself but since I rarely eat meat I don't know how to cook it. I'm also ok at cooking for 1 or 2 but have no practice cooking for a group of 9 I screwed it up, undercooked chicken, and overcooked some steak and her dad was angry with me. I got short with him and told him that if he knew how to do better he could pitch in instead of standing around criticizing. But he got furious and said he was on his vacation. I said that I was trying to have a vacation too, or did they invite me to be an unpaid domestic servant?  Meg's parents and dad's friends got angry I said that and started yelling at me. The argument escalated, I sarcastically called myself the help His dad snapped at me and told me to get out of their suite and go home. Didn't say shit about how he expected me to do that. I left and called the airline with my ticket, and asked them if they could do anything to prevent anyone else from modifying or cancelling my ticket. They let me set a passcode, and no changes could be made to the flight without it.   Then I went to the resort desk to ask about rooms, saying I was stranded unexpectedly. They actually did have some affordable rooms available because of a weekday discount. So I got housing and still had money left over for touristy stuff.  I went sightseeing and relaxed on the beach for three days, until Meg's parents ran into me. They were taking a sunset walk and did a double take seeing me on the beach. They said they thought I was going home, and I said I decided to stay. They were angry because they saw me staying and using the return flight as having deceived them into thinking I couldn't afford a vacation, and using them for flights when I could actually afford things.  AITA for staying on that vacation and using the flight home? ,,,,",

        "selftext": "When I was 25, we found out that my father had been cheating on my mother for years and he had a 7 year old daughter with his mistress. In one split second, the happy family I knew was gone, and I went through the darkest time in my life. My parents divorced and per their prenup, my mother walked away with most of their assets (since she also contributed more to the family income). She never forgave my dad for what he did and never talked to him again, though she grudgingly allowed me to have whatever relationship I wanted to have with him. I eventually forgave my dad mostly because I was tired of carrying so much anger and hurt in my heart. I talk to him but I want nothing to do with his mistress or my half sister. My mother died last year and left me everything - her money, her real estate assets, and her business, which I now own and operate. I am in a relatively comfortable financial position, while my dad is... getting by. He was never a good businessman on his own and lost a lot of his money on businesses that later went belly up. This year my half sister was diagnosed with a life threatening sickness, and she has been in the hospital for the last four months. The bills are mounting and my dad came to me for help because they are now in a situation where they are finding it difficult to come up with money for my half sister's treatment. The thing is, I don't want to use my mother's money to pay for the treatment of the child her husband had with his other woman. Though it's not my half sister's fault, it feels so unfair when I think that the money my mother worked hard all her life for will go to a child that neither my mother and I have any responsibility towards, and the very same child of the man and the woman who hurt her so much at that. I'd really rather use it to grow her company and let my dad and my half sister's mother figure out how to get money for her treatment. They are her parents after all. The only thing tying me to her is my father saying She is your sister and If she dies because she didn't get the treatment she needs, would you be able to sleep at night? AITA?",

Ngl most of my mom\u2019s family is high key racist and is been problems sometimes growing up. My grandma on my mom\u2019s side never liked my dad and was happy after they divorced when I was 7. My names Emiliano and my grandma always complained how hard she tried to change my parents minds and it\u2019s a shame I got stuck with it. I\u2019m actually proud of it. My dad told me about the revolutionary I was named after and their history. But literally my entire life my grandma refuses to say it. She says it\u2019s \u201ctoo many syllables\u201d (i got a cousin named Alexandria and they say the whole name) and always came up with her own names. She says Leo or once tried to get everyone to call me \u201cElliot\u201d as a nickname for a while. Obvious my moms family was for it but my dad refused that cause it\u2019s not my name.  Is always the same thing when I see them. She\u2019ll call me Leo or whatever. Even when I correct her she says it\u2019s not a big deal an keeps calling wrong name. I told my mom I don\u2019t like it but she always say I\u2019m just not gonna change her mind and no point in fighting it. So I decided if she not gonna wanna call me by my actual name in not gonna call her grandma or say her right name. Is stupid I know but it\u2019s bothering me more that she don\u2019t care and all my other cousins she says their names fine, no nicknames.  Her name is Susan so I decided to call her Sandy.   Tbh I was scared to say it but that look on her face was worth it lmao. It wasn\u2019t surprise Pikachu face but it was close. She said that is not how I address her and it\u2019s \u201cgrandma\u201d. I told her nah I\u2019mma call her sandy from now until she says my actual name. It got awkward. My mom was serious and my gma got super red in the face. She started ranting about me being a fucking disrespectful child and this is all my dad influencing me again. My mom told me I need to apologize immediately but idk what gave me the balls to not do it. We ended up leaving there house early and my mom didn\u2019t talk to me until we got home.  She say what I did was outta line and I don\u2019t disrespect my elders ever. She wants me to apologize and I\u2019m grounded until I do. Haven\u2019t talked to my dad yet about this since it just happened but I wanted to ask if it was being an asshole or was it okay for this situation to \u201cinsult my grandmother\u201d ?",

At first I thought their dad was just keeping a few outfits there for them. However, my 8 yr. old got upset when she was packing. I asked her what was wrong. She told me her dad takes her clothes and sells them on line. That she doesn\u2019t want to take her favorite shirt over there. I immediately called my ex. I asked him to return our daughters clothes. Not wanting to throw my daughter under the bus. I blamed it on them not having enough for school. He played dumb. He said he got rid of the clothes that were too small. I pointed out that the jeans our (7 yr.) had were brand new. He then said that it was only fair he got some cash because he owned the trailer and land. If it wasn\u2019t for him I wouldn\u2019t be doing this good. I was pissed. I took my daughters down to the dollar store and bought cheap shirts.To a thrift store and bought cheap shorts.We had a \u201cgirls\u201d tie dye night. Hot pink every thing. Each made 5 shirts and 5 bottoms. I let our girls design and decorate them. My girls loved it.  The following week Ex sends the girls home. I could tell he is mad but, he didn\u2019t say anything. The clothes were not returned. No fear I knew this would be a issue. We made extras. When the girls went back they were wearing tie dye. They were with their dad for a hour before he called and demanded different clothes. I kindly told him that our daughters love those clothes (they really really love tie dye). Ex get even angrier and said his parents have a major family party and the girls can\u2019t wear pink tie dye. I told him that he should go buy other clothes if he didn\u2019t want them to wear it. He called me an A for being petty.AITA?Edited to add. Thank you so much for all the comments. Here are some things to clarify.1) AP stands for Affair partner 2) owned is past tense. My ex is not on the land deed or the title to my trailer.3) sadly this is a true story. I am sorry for those who don\u2019t believe it. At the same time my heart goes out to those who shared your similar stories. Thank you for the love and support",

        "selftext": " I M37 have been with my fiancee F37 for 2 years. We're getting married soon, I've only met her family a couple of times. My daughter Judy F16 has never met them til very recently where they hosted dinner to celebrate 4th of july and that's when they met her for the first time. Judy has a visible burnscar on her forehead. It was due to an accident she was in when she was 9. She used tk be incredibly insecure about it. To the point where I was forced to home school her and it was hard trying to deal with and navigate through this rough time. Now she's doing a lot better though some comments can really cause her to become stressed out and anxious. My fiancee knows all that and respects it. Before we went to her parents house I asked her to tell them about Judy and her struggle and get to try and not say anything negative about it or possibly mention it. She said she would guarentee no one will say anything. We got to the event and they talked to Judy and she slowly warmed up to them. Everything was going well til I was dinner time. My FMIL looked at Judy while she was eating and pointed at her scar. Basically asking questions about it which made Judy lose her appetite and start to get uncomfortable. I kept sending my fiancee and her mom signs to knock it off but to no avail. Finally, FMIL then brought up the wedding and asked my fiancee if it'd be possible to photoshop the scar out of any wedding photos that will have Judy in them just in case they distract viewers. I was dumbfounded, fiancee said nothing just stared casually while nodding. I looked at Judy and it was clear this got to her. I leaned closer and asked if she was feeling uncomfortable and that we could leave if the answer was yes. She took her time then nodded and said yes, I'm feeling uncomfortable right now.I got up and told her to get ready cause we were leaving. My fiancee, her mom and the family started insisting we finish dinner and stay but I refused. I took Judy and got in the car and left before even talking to my fiance. Obviously, she was pissed. She called an was angry talking about how I disrespected her parents by taking Judy and leaving in the middle of dinnerand not even saying goodbye, i told her that Judy was feeling uncomfortable with FMILs comments and questions. She said Judy overreacted and is in need to go back to therapy if a simply mention of her scar caused her to react that way. I got tired of arguing and asked her to give us some time but she went on me and said that I have no respect for her and her family and that what I did was irrational and now she won't speak to me til I clear things up with her family after ruining their celebratory dinner.",

        "selftext": " Hi. I'm a new mom, had my son 5 weeks ago. my husband's parents have been staying with us and things have been super overwhelming. MIL has a habit of taking the baby and refusing to give him back to me. She'd say I'm deliberately ruining her time with him. My son needs feeding every 2hrs and she basically makes me beg her to hand him over to me so I could feed. last night at 10PM. MIL had my son in her arms while sitting on the couch with my husband and his dad. I was exhausted, the baby started crying. I told my MIL to hand him over to me so I could feed him. She refused and I kept asking. my husband starts talking about what a whinny little girl I was to complain that our son is receiving love and cuddles and how I'm using feeding as an excuse to keep the baby away from his mom. I ignored him and told his mom to hand over the baby. she refused and said I needed to wait a little longer. I got angry at this point, My husband said I could take the baby after I ask his mom nicely. This had me seething I meanly told his mom to stop being annoying and overbearing and hand him over to me. She looked at me shocked and hurt. She handed the baby over and ran into the guest room and my husband gave me a look than followed her and stayed inside to comfort her. He came into the room while I was feeding my son and started yelling about how disrespectful I was to speak to his mom this way and treat her poorly when all she's doing is showing our son more love than I do. I told him about how she's been taking the baby for hours and preventing me from feeding him properly. he said that 1, our son isn't an object for me to act like I own him and 2, his mom was doing nothing wrong and 3, I should've asked nicely instead of being a bi$ch to his mom and making her cry. I started crying and yelled that I'd go to my mom's place if his parents stay any longer and he yelled back saying shut the fuck up, you're only acting up cause you don't want my parents around! fuck's wrong with you? then walked out. I felt terrible thinking maybe I was rude to his mom but I also think that I'd hit my limits here.AITA for not asking her nicely like my husband wanted?

        "selftext": "This might seem silly. I (24F) like wearing cheerful socks, since my uniform is all white (currently working as an phlebotomist), it usually cheers up the patients too.  I've spent a few years collecting strange socks, ones with sushi, pizza, corgis, cats, Nick Cage, etc. I think I had about 30 pairs. My boyfriend (29M) has always hated them, and thinks they're childish. So I agreed to only wear them to work, and never on dates or around his friends/family. I thought that was fair.  On boxing day his parents came over for coffee and gifts (just the 4 of us, which is allowed where I live, and keeping a solid 3 meters apart). I accidentally put on a pair of 'childish' socks, and his mother made a comment about it. I explained that I wear them to work to cheer people up, and she liked that. My boyfriend didn't.  The next day all my socks were gone, and the drawer was filled with plain black socks. I asked my boyfriend, and he told me he threw them away and purchased some more 'appropriate' socks, so I won't embarrass him in front of his parents again.  I told him that that's insane, they were mine and he had no right to throw them away. Not to mention that I spend quite some time collecting them.  So I made a list of the ones I remembered I had, and told him that I expect the same ones as a replacement. He told me that's completely unreasonable, and that it would take a lot of time/effort/money for him to find those specific pairs. I haven't changed my mind yet, they cost me a lot of time and effort to find too.  I think he's being controlling, he thinks I'm being unreasonable and demanding.  AITA? I think I might be an asshole for asking for the exact same pairs, I know that'll take a lot of effort to find. Edit: Thanks everyone for replying, I've realised that this might not be a 'normal' fight and am evaluating the relationship.",

I also have two stepbrothers who are younger and who I don't really interact with. My dad has a four bedroom house. So all the kids have a bedroom. When I went to visit last month, I was surprised with a renovated room. And by renovated I mean it was converted to an office with a couch that pulls out to a bed. It did look nice I suppose. Apparently my stepmother works from home and needed an office. I didn't cry or throw a tantrum. I slept in the room that weekend and have refused to stay the night since. I was really hurt and felt like I didn't matter. My mom tried to convince me to go back but gave up after I told her I was old enough to decide. My dad is stressing out and has apologized and said he'll change the room back but honestly, I'm done. This was the final thing that sealed the deal for me. I told him that as well. I told him I'll come for day visits and we can have dinners but I won't be staying overnight anymore. Was I the asshole? He did cry and I feel really shitty about it.

        "selftext": "My 7 year old daughter\u2019s doing virtual school in our living room recently. I heard her teacher address a girl named Kelly a few times, which stuck out to me because my daughter\u2019s class is only about 15 kids and I know them all by this point in the year.  A couple times more and I realized she was calling my daughter Kelly. My daughter\u2019s name is Keeley, pronounced Kee-Lee.  So after school was over I asked her if that had been happening all year in this teacher\u2019s class and she said it had and it really annoyed her. I asked her why she hadn\u2019t corrected the teacher if it annoyed her so much and she said she had repeatedly at the beginning of the year but the teacher kept calling her Kelly, so eventually she gave up on reminding her.  I sent the teacher a quick email explaining the misunderstanding but got no response. This teacher teaches a special subject (think music, gym, art, or language), not just one grade level, so my daughter will be in her classes for the next several years, so we couldn\u2019t just wait it out. And how moments like these are handled now will set the stage for how my kid deals with similar situations on her own in the working world.  I encouraged my daughter to come to class early or stay late her again, thinking maybe she hadn\u2019t heard or understood her last time, so a quiet one on one would be better. She got to the class early and she told her very politely that her name was \u201cKeeley like really, instead of Kelly like jelly\u201d and that people often get it confused so she just wanted to clarify. So class starts and sure enough she gets called Kelly again almost immediately. So there\u2019s only so much self advocation a seven year old can be expected to do. I just walked over and said \u201cHi, this is *Keeley\u2019s* Dad. Her\u2019s name not Kelly. It\u2019s Keeley. Hard E. Sorry for any confusion.\u201d  A few hours later I had an email in my inbox \u201cinviting\u201d my wife and I to a parent teacher conference with the vice principle.  The long and short of the meeting ended up being the school feels that while the teacher probably should\u2019ve learned her name, that the real problem is she feels I challenged her authority by correcting her in class and that the names were \u201csimilar enough\u201d for it to \u201cnot have warranted such drastic action.\u201d That surprised me. I couldn\u2019t believe a meeting was necessary, let alone that it cast blame on us.  I can\u2019t tell if I\u2019m being that annoying \u201cmy kid matters most\u201d parent that my grandmother the schoolteacher always complained about or if the teacher should just learn her damn name because that\u2019s a basic part of her job.

        "selftext": "My (29f) parents have always been in financial trouble, something that I have never been able to understand because they both have a really generous salary (more than three times my own). Because of these financial troubles, my auns, uncles, and grandma have had over the years to lend them money, we were evicted a couple of times (that I know), we have had the water, the electricity and the internet cut... Many things that over the years I admit have affected my emotional and mental health. All of this has made my relationship with my parents very difficult over the years, more when they would take advantage of me making me pay for many things with the money that I earned working during holidays to pay for college or making me call my grandma to ask her for money, all of it while my mum used to spend money whenever she could in purses or jewellery . In the moment I became an adult because they started to sign on the bills under my name without my permission mostly because their credit was so bad that the companies wouldn't allow them to sign with their own names. When I figured it out I asked them to stop but they just lied about it and I just let it go because I couldn't deal with it. Fast forward to the present, because of the 'rona situation, I was looking forward the money from my income tax return, because my salary has gone down so this money would have helped a lot. Instead of it, I received a letter from a courthouse saying that the money has been confiscated. I immediately phoned my mum and she said that she didn't know anything about it but she will fix it. Since I don't trust her at all I called the court myself and then they explained me that during the last year there has been a proccess against me by a company I owe money from unpaid bills. All the papers had been sent to my parents and they had sign and take them. The debt was not paid with the money from the tax income so part of my salary from now on will be confiscated too until is fully paid. So my parents stole my identity to contract a bill under my name, didn't pay for it and when the company claim that debt through lawyers and a judge they kept all the papers from me (which is also illegal) apparently waiting for all of it to be fixed by itself. My mother said that it was her right to put it under my name because I am her daughter and it is my duty to help with the family burdens. Since then, and after really nasty words from her side and my sister's (who says that I am ungrateful and selfish) I haven't spoken to them and I am in the middle of a global pandemic with my salary already low, paying for a debt that it is not mine. My friends and boyfriend say that I should talk with the police and stop all of this because otherwise they will keep doing it and I am afraid they will. So, WIBTA if I speak with the court even if it means that my parents (70 and 63) could go to jail?

        "selftext": "My older brother (OB) is... a bit of a bum. It's mean to say but it's true. He can never hang onto a job for longer than a couple years max and when he inevitably loses whatever job he had he starts mooching off family and friends until he can find another job months later. This entails him freeloading at their place, eating their food, using their stuff, etc. He's lost friends because of how long he bummed off of them and I don't blame them for cutting him off. Well this last time he lost his job he went to our parents but they didn't have room because they were letting our eldest brother's (EB) family stay with them after he and SIL lost their jobs out of nowhere within the same month (EB's entire crew was laid off with zero warning and SIL's work burned down) and they couldn't afford the home they were renting anymore. So OB was pretty much SOL. So our parents, aunt, and uncle all started calling me asking if I'd take him in just long enough so he could get on his feet again. I (stupidly) let myself feel bad for him and said okay, but he only had a few months to get another job or he was out on the street. They all said of course, of course and so he came to stay with me. And it was a nightmare. He's a slob. He NEVER washes dishes, never washes his clothes, and eats pretty much whatever he wants. I guess since I'm his little sister he figured he could ignore me saying to get his shit together. Well after 6 months I told him he had to go. And gave him a couple weeks to find somewhere else. Well it seems he called our parents and cried about me kicking him out and they told him he knew he couldn't stay forever but they also ofc called my aunts/uncle and told them all about it. And my busybody aunt called me and scolded me for being cruel to my brother and abandoning family when they need help. I let her talk and finally said she was right, helping family was important and I'm glad she showed me that. She seemed glad I understood the right thing to do before hanging up. So I followed her advice and packed my bro up and drove him to her house. I couldn't take care of him anymore (he was running all my bills up) but my aunt made a good point, family should help each other. So I dropped him off there (she has room since all her kids moved out) and then left. But I wasn't even halfway home before I was getting multiple calls from my parents and aunt. Parents were demanding to know why our aunt was blowing up their phones and aunt was leaving voicemails shouting at me to come back and get my brother. I explained to my parents and they said it was a good idea since aunt sounded like she wanted to help but my aunt called me an asshole and said she didn't want my brother there. And when I told her family helps each other she called me a cunt. Last I checked he's still living with her. AITA? - Sorry for my lack of replies! I answered what ones I could before I left for work and when I got back I had far too many to answer. Lots of people have been asking similar questions so I thought answering them here once would be helpful. 1. My brother doesn't work menial jobs, he's not just hopping from one minimum wage job to another. He's working Very Good paying jobs. Like electronic repair, automotive maintenance, etc. He's very skilled but lazy.2. No my aunt hasn't spoken to me since she called me a cunt then hung up on me.3. My brother has only been with her about 3-ish weeks. He stayed with me for 6-7 months.4. My brother was upset I was kicking him out initially but in a better mood when he realized I had another place lined up for him to stay. Not sure how they're doing together since I haven't talked to either since after I dropped him off.5. No my aunt isn't married anymore, her and my uncle got divorced and he lives with his new wife (but I heard from dad that he thought this all was hilarious). - Edit 2 - To everyone who has been hounding me through PM and in the comments, my brother isn't (last time we checked) neurodivergent nor does he have ADD or ADHD. Our mom took him to the doctor more than once around when he was 15-17 when his behavior was at its worst.  According to our mom the doctors all said he was perfectly healthy and fine, though they (the doctors) suggested he wasn't being mentally stimulated enough (aka he was bored?). Mom wanted to take him to see other doctors but by then he'd turned 18 and refused to go and she couldn't force him. Also its been suggested he maybe see a doctor now but my OB doesn't seem at all interested. He's never had the highest respect for doctors or mental illness. He treats it like it's fake. When our baby sister was diagnosed with an ED when she was 19 he just cracked a joke about her just wanting a doctor's note so she could eat more...",

        "selftext": "For context, this year was the first time we would try the elf on the shelf with our kids. We have 3 kids, Lucas (9M), Andy (8M), and Claire (5F). Where Lucas and Andy are from our past relationships. However, Miles (my husband M37) has accepted Andy as his, and so did I (F35) with Lucas. Every Christmas is special for Andy, his bd is on Dec/24.  His dad started a tradition where Santa would've consideration with him for being a kid of Christmas. So he feels magical and special. I always try to give him that. Last year, i left Santa Claus footsteps, ate a carrot and grass he left for Rudolf. Stuff like that. My husband doesn't think it's a good idea i do all that for him, and I'm showing favoritism. So, we should shut it down, because of my ex's decision to create a tradition without considering my other kid's feelings. I disagree since i do consider the 3 of them. But he asked if we could so smth else, like the Elf on the shelf. I had no problem with it, but I didn't know how that works. He explained me quickly, and since he was the one who offered, i let him do it. We bought the cute Elf. My kids named it Bob. Later my husband explained them they should behave, and never touch/hold Bob if they don't want it to be naughty. At first, it was cute to see them spy on Bob, try to see it fly each night. Andy was the most excited of all, i found him one night talking with it, asking it if Santa still remembered him. But my husband took seriously the Behave or Bob would be naughty part. Lucas was his first victim after he didn't do his chores. The next day, his face was drawn with sharpie markers. Then Claire, who touched Bob and her fave onesie was destroyed. Apparently, Bob had cut some pieces of it, while she was sleeping. Miles was having fun, but i could see my kids weren't. I talked to him about how we should lower the pranks, he agreed but wanted to catch Andy since he hadn't break any rules. I told him that Bob's supposed to tell Santa instead of being naughty. We argued but he finally agreed. Fast forward, it's Christmas Eve and in the afternoon we had some of Andy's friends to celebrate his bd. So the kids were playing in backyard. But my husband looked sus. I decided to look for Bob. It was supposed to be in the kitchen but it wasn't there, I asked Miles where it was and he told me no idea. I started getting paranoid, but Andy asked me if we could cut the cake already. I put my best face on and went for it. The cake was in a box, and when Andy opened the box. He starts crying. I take a look and it's ruined. Bob was covered in all of it, appearing he had been eating the cake. Half of the cake wasn't there anymore. Miles starts laughing and so did some of the other parents. My blood is boiling and i grab Bob and throw it in the trash, Then i grabbed Miles. We have a terrible argument, calls me an AH for what i did to Bob, that I've ruined it, how are we supposed to keep the magic with our kids if i wasn't supposed to touch Bob. Edit: Hi everyone, so the response has been really overwhelming. I'm sorry if it took me some time to answer i was kinda avoiding the post, since i was conflicted by the possible outcome. I'm going through all your comments, so i can answer some of your questions. I'd also explain things you all have doubts in common. 1.-Andy's dad is from Canada, he visit's Andy every spring, summer and on Christmas break. This year he stayed for his job, so he isn't an absent parent. 2.-After Andy's bd i told Miles to get out of the house, and so he did, he spent Christmas with my in laws. I stayed with the kids, and all of them slept in Andy's room. My kids didn't want to leave his brother alone. The next morning we opened the gifts and i made sure that Andy could feel special after what happened on his bd, so i wrote a note from Bob. Saying that he is sorry if scared him and his siblings, he didn't do his job correctly so now he would be flying to the NP with Santa. And when he asked if Santa still remembered the kid of Xmas, he did. Santa was really happy to see him. 3.-My kids and i, are ok, we are sleeping at my parent's house. And we would celebrate NYE here too. 4.-Yes, Claire was usign the onesie while she was sleeping. My husband took the idea out of Tik Tok. And no, Andy, did nothing to even be attacked by Bob.",

        "selftext": "I moved from Georgia to the Pacific Northwest last year for a dream job after I graduated college. It was a little bit of a culture shock, because I went from being one of many black people around at any given time to often being the only non-white person in a room, let alone black person. There hasn't been a lot of overt racism, but there's been a lot of strange borderline situations that are amusing and race-related but not necessarily racist. For example, every white woman I meet mentions Beyonce to me within the first five minutes. When I was sitting for my driver's license photo the woman taking my picture opened with, 'So... Beyonce.' So the problem in the post title is that I am the only black woman at my office, and I am constantly, constantly being called the wrong name at work, and I'm coming up on my one-year anniversary. My name is Tina, short for Christina. Pronounced just like it looks, very easy name. For some reason, a handful of people at work call me Tiana, Tiara, or Tia, I think assuming that my name has to be more 'black sounding' than it is. I am most often called Tiana, especially by one of the guys on our development team and by the 'big boss' for another team, which I think then confuses their team members back into calling me the wrong name again. The other thing is that apparently another black woman (elderly, not in the same position I'm in) used to work there and I get called her name (Mary) sometimes too. Sometimes people will look at my name plate and ask me, How do you pronounce that? It's Tina! I have tried politely correcting this and I correct it immediately every time. From polite, Just for the record, my name is Tina! to lighthearted, Tina, like Tina Belcher! In e-mails from me that say Tina in a million places, including my e-mail address, I still get, Thanks Tiana! Sooo... I'm considering doing the Twitter approach, where I just respond to coworkers who call me the wrong name with the wrong name. Like: Chuck: Thanks, Tiana Tina: No problem, Chad! Jessica: Hi Tiara! Tina: Good morning, Jennifer! Would I be the asshole if I did this? I know it's passive aggressive, but every form of polite correction hasn't worked, and I feel really disrespected by this, so I may as well have some fun with it. EDIT: I am pretty overwhelmed by the responses so I just want to add a couple of things: A lot of people have suggested that I gently and firmly remind people of my name. That's what I've been doing, and was my first line of defense! A lot of people have suggested I go to HR. This is the kind of nebulous thing HR doesn't really help with, and it isn't as serious as it could be. A lot of people who identify themselves as white have informed me that this isn't race-related. It is. I have been black for 25 years, and I have a lot of firsthand experience with racism, and I can identify it in my own life. It isn't overt racism, like a slur or an assault, but it is still race-related. I feel like a few people are ALMOST getting it. A lot of people are referencing that Key and Peele sketch with the substitute teacher, which is literally a joke about how white people do this to black people, turned on its head! And finally, a few people have asked why I don't use Tina Turner as an example, since she's also a black Tina. First, I thought young-ish white people would be more familiar with Tina Belcher, but I used 'Tina Turner' as an example for our Dean and he then 'affectionately' nicknamed me Tina Turner, which took deprogramming from his EA to get over. EDIT #2: No, I don't have a southern accent. I'm from Atlanta, and black people from Atlanta don't really have an indecipherable country twang. Plus, my 'working in an office' voice is pretty practiced/neutral. More to the point, no accent makes the name 'Tina' sound like 'Tiana' or Tiara No, the people I work with aren't just 'idiots.' As annoying as this is, they are not stupid people. No, I can't wear a 'Hi, my name is' sticker or a nametag. We have a business professional dress code! Yes, I correct them every time. No, it's not because I'm not 'memorable' or a bad employee! Responding to this post saying, 'Okay Shaniqua' or some other racist caricature of a name truly misses the point, as this is already what my coworkers are doing ('Tiana' being the 'Shaniqua' in this instance). Several people have alarmingly said, 'Okay, Trayvon' and invoking the name of a dead black child at the idea of me calling a white guy 'Chad' is VERY WEIRD!",

        "selftext": "Heyo,I'm a schizophrenic.  Started when I was 22, and will last till I die. I'm active in schizophrenic communities, go to groups,  the works but I am fairly private about it to most people to include friends. It's fairly common for people to think I'm eccentric (comes with the turf) due to some of my habits. Those habits include not going to parties or other places with lots of people, suddenly deciding not to do something (I have to be protective not to do or go to certain things if I think a delusion might be coming on), saying the occasional odd quip, normal schizophrenic stuff. Some friends thought it would be funny to make it seem like  I might be going crazy as a group. They would individually wear something silly like a wizard hat or dinosaur costume (TRex blow up costume) to a group event or say something totally out of the ordinary and pretend like it was normal (Police like to track people like you, covid is just a way to microchip you, etc). These are very real scary thoughts to me. I would ask members of the group if they had heard concerns about these conspiracies or weird garb from the other members, but they all acted like they had hung out with that particular member that day and I hadn't been involved. I was really, really scared that this could have been a massive delusion morphing into a full psychosis so I preemptively checked myself into a hospital to stop myself from potentially hurting myself or diving further into the rabbit hole(common in schizophrenic community). I was so scared my medications stopped working. No one heard from me for a few days while I was in the hospital, and when I checked out I confided in one of them about what had happened. I got a really long apology explaining what had happened and I blew up at them.  I have ignored attempts from the others trying to apologize and have no desire to talk with them again. AITA for not previously stating that I am schizophrenic? Edit- People have been asking saying to post the length of the prank. Around 3 weeks. Edit 2- Thank you for the awards and stuff, but I really want to highlight some of the messages I have gotten. I'm at around 150 messages and counting and am trying to respond to the ones where I can hopefully offer insight. Resources that I find helpful- r/schizophrenia  For groups just google schizophrenia support groups in my area, something will pop up and when you actually get there someone will have a further list.  You get what you put into groups. You don't have to talk your first couple of times. But no one will look at you with the batshit look if you say Reality check- is there a bird in the room or something in that regard. That did happen once and the audible sigh of relief from 8 other people and the laughter that followed was hysterical.  Medication helps so much. It's the difference between being able to go for a walk with my dog and staying in bed all day. But it takes time. So many people have asked what drug and dosage a loved on should go on. I cannot answer that. There are so many drugs out there and different dosages. I can tell you that you (probably) will not have a noticable difference in behavior in two weeks after trying a medication. You start small, and work your way up to a therapeutic effect (when it actually helps). It might take some time to actually get to feeling human again. Not every medication is meant for every person, but don't give up!",

        "selftext": "I (35M) am a single father of 3 boys (10M, 7M and 3M). Their mother died last year due to ovarian cancer. It has been a rough year to say the least. My sister got divorced 6 months ago and temporarily moved in with me and the boys. She has a son, my nephew (9M) who stays with us most of the time. My nephew and my 10yro are not the best of friends, but so far they got along fine apart from some teasing from both sides. A few weeks ago my 10yro started telling me that his cousin was bullying him and being mean to him. He called him names, pushed him around, took his video games etc. I talked to my sister many times and told her to talk to her son, we talked to the boys together and things settled down. Yesterday was my 3yro's birthday, so my whole family was here and my late wife's family as well. It was extremely emotional for everyone, because it was the first birthday since my wife's been gone. The boys (10yro and 9yro) started fighting again and I asked them both to calm down and behave. My son started crying and told me his cousin teased him about him not having a mom. I choked up and asked my nephew if that was true, and he said yes, but that he's sorry. I figured I'd have a proper talk with him and my sister after the party, so I just told him what he said was really awful and he cannot say it again. I comforted my son and we went back to the party. Before we cut the cake, my sister came yelling at me, saying I had no bussineaa disciplining her child. I told her to drop it and we'll talk later, instead she said besides, he's right, kids need a mom. I had tears in my eyes by that time and she just said see, it's even turning you into a pu**y. My in-laws were crying, I was tearing up, the kids were upset, just awful. I told her to stop it and just leave me and the kids and the family to cut the cake and we will talk in the evening. She said listen we both lost our spouses, but at least I'm still a normal person. She stormed off. After the party I told her she has 2 days to pack her shit and leave. She is begging me not to throw her out, because she and her kid will be homeless. Aita for throwing her out? UPDATE: my mom agreed to take my sister in temporarily, and my nephew is still going to his dad's because now his dad is saying that there's no way he's letting my sister ruin their kid. I want to thank you all for your kind words and all the love and support. Also, to everyone who also shared about losing a loved one, I am so so sorry for your loss. My nephew is supposed to leave tomorrow morning, my mom is picking my sister up right around that time, and my inlaws are bringing my boys back in the evening. We'll have a little post-birhday thing for my little one when they come, just me, the boys and my inlaws. Just some ice cream (he said he prefers it over cake) and a few cartoons. One day at a time.",

        "selftext": "My brother Tom (36m) and I (26f) have never had a really solid relationship, due to our age gap we didn't spend much time and by the time I was old enough to develop a personality he was moved out of the house.  For the last two years my brother and his fiance Sarah (32f) have been planning their wedding. And it's coming up in September. I was asked to be a bridesmaid. I figured i was only asked as a courtesy since I'm her soon to be sister in law but I still took it seriously. I have been a bridesmaid for the last two years. Just a few weeks ago I managed to save up to buy the 800 dollar bridesmaid dress. Over all in the last two years between group outings to parties, dinners,  lunches, clothes, etc\u2026 I spent thousands of dollars. Eventually all the girls in the wedding and I became extremely close and I started to get hyped for the wedding.  Sarah recently got close with her brother's wife Becky (30f). Last week she dropped the ball on me that she no longer wants me to be a bridesmaid and she would prefer if Becky would take my place.  It broke my heart a little but it's her wedding and it's not my place to tell her how to run it so I said it was fine. Yesterday I went to my brother's house to pick up the bridesmaid's dress, and was going to see if I could return it since it was within the time frame.  Sarah was completely appalled and said that Becky was going to wear it since she and I are the same size.  I said that would be fine, but they would have to pay me the 800 for it. Sarah said that Becky couldn't afford and I should just be nice and let her use it and said that I could keep it after the wedding.  I explained that I'm not just giving away the dress, and I'm not ever going to usei after the wedding. After some bickering back and forth I just ended up taking it and leaving.   My brother and Sarah tried to compromise with me, and say I could be the assistant flower girl and I felt offended at the offer. After I said no, they then said that Becky could give me 250 bucks for it. Again no and I returned the dress and got a full refund.   I told them I understand that it's their wedding but they are being extremely disrespectful to me and I don't need to deal with it and I'm not going to the wedding. Today my coworker says she has an extra round trip plane ticket to go to Miami that she'll sell to me for half price plus I would have to pay for half the hotel and I can go hang out with her in Florida. The only downside is that I'll be in Florida for the week of my brother's wedding.  So will I be the asshole if I just go party in miami instead of going to my brother's wedding?",

        "selftext": "My husband and I have been married for 6 years. Still don't have kids (we want them but it still not happening). Friends and family are causing us constant stress about having a baby soon but it's obviously something we can't control. We only wished that they'd stop but to no avail. So what I did was come up with idea (stupid I know) and that is have an empty jar and call it Pregnancy Jar. I carry it with me in my bag whenever I'm with friends and family and everytime someone asks about when my husband and I are gonna have a baby, I pull my Jar out and ask them to drop a dollar in there for asking. I'd get puzzled looks but they reach out for their pockets/wallets/purses and pull out a dollar and out it inside the jar. It actually worked because most of thrm stopped asking after 4 months. Last week we had dinner at my parents house, My brother came back from his business trip that lasted a month and while we were eating he asked when me and my husband were going to have a kid. My husband paused, I got up from the chair and made my way to where my brother was sitting with my jar in my hand and asked him to drop a dollar for the question he asked, he stared at me then laughed nervously asking if I was being serious.  Everyone was looking at us. He said no, he didn't have to pay me but I told him he didn't have to ask either so here we are!. I could tell he felt embarrassed he immediately reached out to his pocket, pulled out his wallet and put a dollar in my jar. I made my way back to my seat and sat down and resumed eating like nothing happened. It got awkward afterward. Mom pulled me into the kitchen later to tell me that I embarrassed my brother infront of his wife and family and said I should quit acting childish by running around with a jar demanding others to put money in it, I told her they should quit asking then. She went on about how they're just worried for us since we are in mid 30s and don't have much time left if we want at least one healthy baby. I got upset and she started arguing. My husband and I left and we haven't seen them in days, except I got a call from my sister basically siding with mom and the others saying I'm being childish. So AITA for this?  [Edit - Q&As... ] (1) this has been going on for years but in the past year it has gotten worse.  (2) I already told them about how I feel regarding this question, my husband doesn't care much and says I should let it go too. (3) Yes they pay everytime because it's just a dollar, it won't make me any richer or them any poorer. (4) My husband and I spend the money on snacks to eat every night when watching tv or some toys for the dogs. One more thing... I realize that this could actually be expanded into wedding jar/Cake jar (for weight loss)/work jar/house jar/ and so no and so on. Depending on the the type of truggle because these are the things we struggle and get frustrated with often but.. with the fact that people will just keep asking then we might become millionaires one day. Lol. Also, someone suggested I up the price to 5$. It will mostly depend on the prices of gas, lol, so we'll see.",

        "selftext": "I have a younger sister who looks exactly like me. I am 19 and she is 16, but people have been mistakening us as twins for some time because of how close we resemble each other. We have same height, same skin tone, similar voice even.  She also has a habit of being a copycat, from way of dressing to hobbies, even piercings. I know, its cute if you look it from the outside, sisters dressing and looking so alike that they are spitting images of each other. Honestly though, it's annoying and creeps me out sometimes, like yeah, we are quite close too but why does she always happen to pick up everything I pick up?? I have been asking her to stop that, but she always insist that she really just finds it suiting her liking that she just had to try it herself by getting similar, if not identical things that I have. One afternoon I was tidying up some costumes in my college showroom and found a rather cute brown and pink wig, looks like mushroom. I put it on, think it looks rather funny so I snapped a picture of it and posted in my Instagram.  I received a text from my sister asking if I really cut my hair(I did not mention it was a wig). The AH part is - while I somewhat have a feeling that she MIGHT copy that too, I lied and replied yes, I want a change of style. I went home when weekends came and lo and behold - my sister emerged with the same silly brown and pink bob cut, except this one is her permanent hair.  She was very surprised that I arrived with my hair still long, then realized that I lied to her. She was furious that she had to cut that silly hairstyle because she thought I had it, but truth be told, I never asked her to. She should have seen it in my picture that that hairstyle look super silly and yet she still tried to cut her hair that way. Our parents think that it was a really bad joke and wanted me to cut my hair too to make it up to her(I wonder why did they not stop her in the first place). While I feel sorry for her, I am somewhat glad that at least she won't be able to copy my hairstyle now with her hair so short so I am keeping my hair long.",

        "selftext": "My (31M) sister Anne (34F) got married on Saturday. My husband of 7 years, Mark (32M), was there with me and up until one point, is was an amazing evening. After the ceremony, Anne wanted a picture with all of our siblings (there\u2019s five of us) and their respective partners so we started lining up. When Anne saw that my husband was standing next to me, she shook her head and said something about him ruining the aesthetic.Apparently, her plan was to put one man and one woman next to each other alternately.  My youngest sister (18F), who doesn\u2019t have a partner and was standing on the very side, offered to stand between the two of us, so we could be close and Anne\u2019s wish would still be respected. I thought that was a great solution, but Anne disagreed and told Mark to get out of the picture.He\u2019s quite introverted and tries to avoid confrontation under all circumstances, so he simply complied and told me not to get angry, but it was obvious that he was hurt and disappointed by being left out. Obviously, it didn\u2019t stop me from getting angry and I walked away with him. I can understand that Anne wants her wedding pictures to look exactly how she imagined them, but I think that the idea my younger sister proposed was very reasonable. I congratulated Anne and her husband one last time, but then I said my goodbyes. When I was asked why we were leaving early (especially before taking the pictures), I said that I didn\u2019t feel like our presence was wanted. We left before dinner was served and I took Mark out to his favorite restaurant to cheer him up a little. Anne has texted me since saying that I was being overdramatic and making a fuss over nothing. Our parents have tried to remain neutral, but expect for my youngest sister, the rest of the family supports Anne and thinks that leaving early was going too far and that I should\u2019ve sucked it up instead of ruining her big day. EDIT: typos EDIT 2 because there was some confusion: My husband is able bodied and white (so is most of my family), but we are indeed a gay couple.",

        "selftext": "To start, my ex and I were 19 when she got pregnant. We had recently broke up and she found out a couple weeks later that she was pregnant. She said she planned to get an abortion but only wanted her sister there. So I was always under the belief that she had aborted. She only contacted me once saying it was done and we didn\u2019t speak again.  Fast forward 19 yrs later, I found out a month ago that was a lie. My ex passed away 3 years ago and my daughter Kara has been living with her uncle.  He was the one to reach out to give me a heads up after she expressed an interest in wanting us to connect. He and I spoke at length because I was feeling some pretty strong emotions like rage for never being told about her.  My ex had backed out of the abortion but didn\u2019t want me involved because we were broken up so decided just not to tell me. But he told me that Kara doesn\u2019t know about that. Apparently I wasn\u2019t ready for fatherhood because we were both young so I bailed.  I couldn\u2019t believe it. Rob (her uncle) told me he knows his sister was wrong for that but promised Kara doesn\u2019t have any negative feelings towards me and my ex never painted me as some villain, just a young guy who knew he couldn\u2019t properly care for her.  He asked me not to tell Kara this when we talk if she asks and because it could hurt the way she saw her mom. I never actually confirmed I would. Kara messaged me and we\u2019ve been talking. I\u2019ve met her twice and it\u2019s been crazy emotional. Looking at this girl who looks just like me and hurting that we\u2019re just barely getting to know each other So far our conversations have only been about what her life was like, how my life is, what her wants/future goals are, and getting to know each other. We met again Tuesday and she finally decided to ask the obvious questions about what made me not be involved. How did I feel, what went through my mind, did I ever think about her,etc. I had been thinking about what to do but in that moment I just didn\u2019t have it in me to lie so I was honest. That I was told about the abortion, had no idea she even existed until now, but that I still really want to be in her life and have the chance to be her father if she wants that. Kara was a bit emotional, we talked some more, and said she still wants me involved. That night my messages were blowing up. Not just from rob but her grandparents as well. They\u2019re all outraged for telling Kara about her mom because she yelled at all of them and is refusing to even take their calls.  Yes, the lie was terrible but I just ruined the image she had of her late mother for my own benefit. Rob called me a selfish dick for not taking into consideration how this would affect Kara finding out about this. So right now I feel like shit. I get \u201chonesty is the best policy\u201d but in this case I don\u2019t know if I was an asshole for doing it.

Me and my sister (37f)are  not as close as we used to be because of some messed up stuff that happened years ago. I had my son Jesse (9) pretty young. Months after that to my surprise my ex was pregnant again. Only I knew it wasn\u2019t me because having an infant to take care of and provide for left me with zero interest in sex. And we found out it was my sister\u2019s fianc\u00e9 -ex now -that she was seeing behind our backs. It hurt. Worst pain ever but for my son\u2019s sake I tried to get past it. I come from a family of half sibs too so I wanted my son to be close to his half brother (Keith).  Surprise, not only were they (my ex and my sister\u2019s ex) horrible lying cheaters, but also terrible parents. Both got hooked on drugs, only escalated from there. He got locked up when Keith was 3. This particular issue with my sister happened a couple years ago: My ex got sick, she was scared of Keith ending up in foster care like her and I didn\u2019t want that for him either. I legally adopted him before she passed when he was 6. Not everyone in my family was on board at first but he\u2019s the kind of kid that is hard *not* to love so they warmed up to him. My sister never did. She hated that I brought the son of her ex fianc\u00e9 into my family. And I understood why it was painful but Keith\u2019s and Jesse\u2019s best interest were my main priority. That\u2019s how we drifted apart. Last weekend was my birthday and had a small barbecue at my place. My parents have tried hard to mend things between us so they convinced me to let her come too so we can chat. I thought that meant she was cool with Keith because obviously the 3 of us are a package deal.  I asked my parents how would she feel about Keith, they said not to worry about it. Again I took it as she came around. Only she wasn\u2019t told he would also be present. But how could he not be? He lives there. My sister got there and she was mad when she saw him . She very specifically said \u201cI thought this was family only what\u2019s he doing here.\u201d Loud enough where he could\u2019ve easily heard but thankfully he was playing with his brother.  My sister was pissed because my parents told her Keith wouldn\u2019t be around. And I got pissed when she told me she didn\u2019t want him here expecting me to do something about it. So I just told her to leave, and she\u2019s not welcome here then. There was some back and forth from her and my parents. I didn\u2019t want that kind of talk around my sons so still made her leave. My mom seems to think I was a huge asshole for kicking her out of my party instead of trying to work things out.  Like they take Keith somewhere out of site while me and her talk. But to me, what\u2019s the point of us working it out if that\u2019s how she still feels toward my son? Well this is still causing some conflict since I \u201cescalated\u201d the feud by making her leave instead of actually talking to her . AITA?",

        "selftext": "Okay, hear me out. I live in a complex that is built in a circle so its like a track. A lot of people use it to run, walk, etc. I've always used it to run/walk as well. I live in Florida so I usually wear leggings and a sports bra or a tank top. I literally only wear it because it's insanely hot here. This woman always gave me dirty looks when I'd walk by her apartment (she'd be sitting on her porch.) There are a few maintenance guys (not sure if that is the correct title for them - but that is what everyone calls them) that walk and ride around on golf carts throughout the day. I soon realized that the dirty look woman is married to one of the maintenance workers. I am always polite to them, but have never talked to them by any means. So, yesterday I was working out on the tennis court which is near their apartment. Her and her husband were sitting on the porch. She is giving me the dirtiest looks and is making me pretty uncomfortable but I try to ignore it. Before I leave she says, Do you like get off on having the maintenance men check you out all day? To which I replied, Actually yes it makes me super wet. They are what keeps my sex drive high. She looked shocked and her husband started laughing and then she smacked him on the arm.  I came back and told my mom this story and she said I should be more sensitive and obviously the woman is insecure. Now I kinda feel bad. AITA?",

        "selftext": "So pretty much the title, I don't think I am the A but I've been getting some flack for it so I really want to clear this up. So I started a new job recently I work in small studio, there are several others in the building, think open plan office with sections assigned to each studio. The person I had an altercation with doesn't work for my studio just FYI.  I eat lunch at 1ish and most people eat at 12. I came down ealry to eat at 12, I made coffee and while at the counter noticed my tuppaware in the sink, empty.  Imagine my surprise when I turned around and saw a man I didn't know sitting down at the table with my food on his plate. He had just stuck it in the microwave. Acting rashly since I was mad, I sat down next to him and said 'hey that looks good, mind if I try it?' Then before waiting for an answer I yanked the plate away from him and snatched his fork out his hand, he just blinked in shock as did the other people there as I started eating. He then, quite loudly, asked what I thought I was doing and I replied 'huh you know this was actually much better when I first cooked it, it probably lost some flavor in the fridge.' he caught on quickly that it was it was my food and went a lil red. I then asked him where he got the gall to steal someone else's lunch and then ask them what they were doing when they took it back. He stuttered out some nonsense about not knowing it was mine and I replied well you knew it wasn't yours right? He just mumbled something like an apology and I said that's no problem it was nice he'd warmed it up for me at least, in an admittedly b*tchy tone, and then he just got up and left and the people there just stared in silence. 2 of the silent watchers, maybe his mates idk, told me that I was rude to him and that there had been nicer ways to go about it. I told them to think how they'd feel if someone ate their food before saying they should focus on their lunch and I'll focus on mine. Well it's been a little awkward at lunch since and I have the impression a few people are talking shite about me at work now, maybe I could've been nicer sure. I still don't think I was wrong but tell me reddit AITA Tldr lunchthief tried to eat my food in front of me I took it back and embarrassed him in front of his colleagues. Edit: Okay this blew up, just wanted to drop an edit on here to say thank you so much for all the comments, support and awards it's great to know I wasn't completely overreacting. Maybe I shoudl chat tp some people and see if the food thief has struck before will update then if yall are interested.  Otherwise additional info, I saw some comments saying I should go to hr but my studio doesn't have hr and the perp doesn't work for the same place, we do have a defacto office manager but I don't want to take it any further since I'm still new here and on probation/think my reaction might have been enough.  Update: So not sure if anyone wanted an update but I finally found out from a a new friend at work that yes the lunch thief has struck before! Apparently everyone wrote their names on their lunch to combat this, and the thief then targeted unmarked lunch or lunch items, guess no one told me ha.  People apparently starting being petty and standoff-ish to the thief since and he blames me for that lol. Also according to my new friend most were actually very pleased that the thief was finally identified/dealt with. I was assured that besides the thief in question and his cronies no one thought I was being a b*tch. However, not knowing much about me, assumed I was a very serious or clique-y person from my reaction, which I mean fair, I dress very professionally when most of the office dresses quite casual which probably added to that (think high heels, blouse and skirt VS shorts, graphic tee and slops). I've started to come down to lunch earlier to chat to some people and the office seems to be warming up to me. So not a drama filled update but I'm very happy things turned out so well and my reputation with my colleagues is off to a good start, thanks again for all of the comments and support think this will be final edit slash update too, thanks reddit :)",

        "selftext": "I F(25) have been renting a house since I was 18 (7 years). When I moved in, the backyard was a large piece of dirt, no lawn or anything, just a decently big backyard with a fence all around. It was a cheap but not great house, but I signed because I wanted the backyard space.  Over the past few years I erected a small garden shed, greenhouse and pizza oven (transportables), planted lots of veggie gardens in big transportable garden beds, and put down some nice pavers, an aquaponics set up, and generally made the backyard a really green and beautiful place to be. It became the green oasis all my friends gathered at.  A few months ago, my landlords let me know they were planning to sell, and my final move out day was a week ago. When I left, I brought my garden with me to my new place - nothing in my last backyard was directly planed into the ground, and nothing permanent. I dismantled the sheds and greenhouse, loaded up all the pots and garden beds onto a truck and cleared the backyard in three days with lots of help.  My former landlords are furious over this, and demand that I return the backyard to the former state - apparently they\u2019d listed the house for sale with pictures of the backyard and potential buyers were walking away from the house when they saw the barren backyard. They\u2019re accusing me of stealing their plants, and wrecking the backyard. Legally I\u2019m fine - my contract said I could garden, and I have photos from the first real estate walkthrough before I moved in that show that the backyard was in the same state as I first found it (although with more fertile soil now probably). The same real estate agent signed off my final inspection, and I got my deposit back.  I\u2019ve received mixed responses though, because I saw the landlords taking pictures of my backyard before I left but didn\u2019t make the connection because imho when pictures of a house has furniture in it, you don\u2019t expect to also get free furniture. Some of my coworkers suggested that IATA because the house valuation certainly has fallen dramatically because I didn\u2019t tell them I was taking my garden with me, so they couldn\u2019t plan to landscape before lockdown hit. Tl;dr AITA for moving my garden that I build from my former rental house into my new house, upsetting my former landlords who didn\u2019t expect me to take it with me?",

        "selftext": "Over the weekend, I (23F) went to dinner with some of my dad\u2019s relatives who I don\u2019t see very often.  My dad has never gotten along with my uncle (his brother) and I haven\u2019t either. He\u2019s rude, condescending, and we don\u2019t agree with him on a lot of things.  Normally I just try to ignore him. However, at dinner, my uncle asked me about my car I had shown up in and my new job.  I started my job a little over a year ago after graduating college and I worked hard for it. I make a lot of money and I\u2019m proud of that. (Software engineer.) I recently bought myself my dream car I\u2019ve always wanted.  Uncle asked \u201cHow much are they paying you anyway?\u201d in a condescending tone, and I just point blank told him how much I make.  I guess I was supposed to laugh and say something like \u201cOh, enough\u201d but I told him the number.  He started going off on a rant about how no 23-year-old should make that much money and how stupid my company is for paying me that much.  I got pissed and said \u201cI deserve every penny I make. I work hard and most people can\u2019t do what I do.\u201d  Well, I guess this really made my uncle angry, because after dinner I received a text from my cousin saying I had been really rude at dinner and insulted my uncle\u2019s intelligence. My dad sided with me (since he hates my uncle anyway) but my sister agreed with my cousin and said I shouldn\u2019t have said how much money I make or talked to my uncle the way I did because it was impolite.  AITA? EDIT: Wow, I didn\u2019t expect for this to blow up! Thanks for the responses everyone. I feel justified in how I reacted now. For more info on my uncle - he\u2019s a retired airline pilot, so I don\u2019t think he\u2019s even jealous/bitter about how much I make, he\u2019s just a jerk.",

        "selftext": " I (F35) am infertile. My ex husband and I tried everything to have kids but it just never happened. He divorced me, went and married someone younger who was able to give him a kid and from what I gather, they're expecting a 2nd child together. It hurts like hell seeing someone else have what I couldn't. I get frustrated with myself sometimes and with family blaming me for basically everything. I turn to my friends for support, Especially Alessia, she's in the same infertility boat as me but she and her husband are currently trying IVF hoping it'd work. Alessia asked me for help to pay for her upcoming IVF cycle. I agreed to write her a check of $12,000, I really wanted to help her and the money came with no strings attached. I wrote the check and gave it to her last week. She was very appreciative of it. The very next day, I got a sudden message from a mutual friend Carol with a screenshot of the conversation she had with Alessia. Turns out she and Alessia were talking about the next IVF cycle, and Alessia said she hoped the cycle would work because she didn't wanna end up divorced, and having her husband go marry someone younger and have a baby with them and another one on the way! While she's alone and without a family at 35! (She's 32). I was stunned and...hurt, I knew she meant me here. But I did not confront her I simply contacted my bank and cancelled the check. In the evening, Alessia called to ask why I cancelled the check and I told her. She went batshit saying she didn't mean it that way and that she thought that this was somewhat an inside joke between desperate infertile women. She came over with her husband the next day begging I write another check but I refused. An argument ensued and her husband thought I wasn't being supportive of her like when she supported me throughtout my struggles. She left crying and we haven't talked since then. Her husband keeps reminding me (while repeatedly calling Carol a toxic snake) of the date of the next cycle saying they can't have it after I took the money that was supposed to pay for it back!. Some friends thinks I'm being oversensitive. Carol's on my side telling me to tell them to go to hell but I feel so bad about it. what I've done might just damage our 15 years of friendship. Maybe I shouldn't have cancelled it but I just felt so offended by what she said about me and how she basically mocked my unfortunate circumstances. so reddit, AITA? Hello again! And Wow thank you so so much for all this support and compassion that you've shown me. I could feel it through my screen (LOL \ud83d\ude05\ud83e\udd23) I have decided I'm going to put some distance between me andAlessia. Things have been rough lately and I think that distance is what I need right now especially for my mental health. After reading some comments here I now feel less heavy and more relieved. Doesn't change the fact that I'm still feel completely and utterly shocked by Alessia's behavior. It's a shame having to come to the realization that even those who are supportive of you the most, could cause as much harm. Oh and by the way, I sent Carol a link for this thread to see what her thoughts were and she just laughed. She was kind of angry I used her real name but relieved that I used a throwaway LOL.",

She doesn\u2019t live with me, she stays over really often tho, so she has the house keys. 2 days ago, she came over without warning me. Me and my brother were asleep on couch, he wasn\u2019t wearing a shirt because it was hot, and he was laying on top of me. She woke us up and made a scene in front of him. She said that our relationship was weird and disgusting and it\u2019s extremely concerning that he\u2019s so affectionate towards me. My brother was in tears and he even apologized to her. I brought him to his room and calmed him down.  I went back to living room, she was sitting on couch, watching tv and acting like nothing happened. I told her to get the fuck out. She got defensive again and said that she was just stating her opinion without hurting anyone. I grabbed her wrist and brought her to door. I didn\u2019t hurt her, she was following me, I didn\u2019t use any force. She left, she called me few times but I didn\u2019t answer. Update: thanks for all the comments.

        "selftext": "My brother lost his job along with all his savings several months ago, and soon after he asked me if it would be okay if he (28M) and his wife (30F) stayed with me until they could afford their own place again. I hesitated at first, considering I only have a 1 bedroom apartment, but according to them they had 'no other options' so of course I invited them over and bought a blow-up mattress for the living room. For the first month things were manageable, although admittedly cramped. Then my brother told me that sleeping on the mattress was giving him back pains, so he asked if he could buy a small double bed for the living room. The living room is by far the biggest room I have, so I told him that would be fine as long as there was still room for my couch/TV/bookshelves.  The living room is also connected to my kitchen in an open plan style, so I reminded my brother to leave walking space around the bed. It's now been 2+ months and things have gotten a lot worse. When they first moved in, I would still use the living room every day to unwind on the couch after work. Now whenever I go in, there's a strange vibe like I'm intruding. My brother and his wife are often sitting in bed together when I go in (I always knock) and stare at me pointedly until I leave. Sometimes when I sit down they will directly ask me for some 'alone time' and say they would like the room to themselves. This came to a head yesterday when my sister-in-law messaged me with a 'timetable' she'd made of when it would be 'a good time' for me to use the living room. The timetable basically says that they will allow me into the room for an hour each evening, plus 20 minutes around mealtimes. I basically shut her down instantly and told her there was no WAY I'd be following the timetable since in the end it's my apartment. She sent me back a HUGE message with a dozen paragraphs about how my constant presence was 'ruining' her marriage with my brother and they feel like they have no privacy.  I tried to talk this over with my brother that night, but when I got home neither my brother/SIL were talking to me, so he's clearly just as pissed. Today an Amazon parcel arrived for my brother with a lock for the living room door, which I told him there's 'absolutely no way' I will allow him to install. My brother says I'm 'creepy' for wanting constant access to where they sleep and he's insisting on installing the lock anyway. AITA for not giving my brother and his wife their privacy?",

When I returned I found chaos in the office. Apparently one of my colleagues had needed files for a particularly important client of ours and had not been able to find them in my office and I never responded to calls or emails, as I warned I wouldn't do. This coworker knew they'd be handling this client and had 8 days and 12 hours a day to ask me for all pertinent files and appears to have not. In any case, I was blamed because the client is technically mine and I am supervisor of this coworker. I contend that I am blameless because this coworker had 8 days to collect all their files like their other coworkers did and they neglected to do so. No one seems to care about that. AITA here?",

        "selftext": "UPDATE  My account was suspended due to some reddit error. Probably because I made a new throwaway and received a lot of attention I messaged reddit and the issue was quickly resolved. So that is why the last post was removed(it's back now). I'm not sure what the rules on updates are here\r  \r  \r  \r  \r  \r  A lot of people wanted an update I wanted to see my roommate in a more positive light. I tend to try to see the best in people but reading the replies and his recent actions have opened my eyes. I never took him too seriously because he's a pretty harmless little guy in my perspective. There is a big difference in how he lashes out at me compared to his gf. He's gotten big tough with me in text form but only mildly upset when I see him in person. I have taken a step back and looked at anything I could have done to provoke him(not excusing his behavior) And while I don't believe I am in the wrong for being hospital and hosting a guest. If a 75 year old man we're staying with us. I would treat him the same as I have treated his gf.\r  \r  \r  \r  \r  \r  I do realize that he is not from the south. I was told by others in school that women outside the south don't enjoy being called ma'am. however, I've never seen a lady get angry if I did call her ma'am up here. I call women of all ages dear or darling and I could see how that could be seen as flirtatious even though it's just part of how I speak. Now that he knows I have seen him in his true form he doesn't even try to act the way he did before. I sent his gf screenshots of the texts he's sent and told her the things he's said. I'm not sure if she is leaving or staying but I've let her know and told her to let me know if she needs any help. I don't plan on moving any time soon as I enjoy having room for a grill and smoker and a garage. He told me he's looking for new places to live and will potentially go back to his parents. I make enough working at a restaurant to afford the rent alone. I would like more going into savings but I'm not worried financially for the time being.\r  \r  \r  \r  \r  \r  \r  \r  I am flattered and overwhelmed by all the positive replies. Bout a hundred of you told me to thank my mom so I sure will. I grew up working in hospitality with my mom and siblings. My dad is the one that instilled respect into me. He never felt emasculated even when my mom's business ended up making more than he does. They just save their money from their jobs and go on vacation a lot. Thank you for all the kindness and offers for adoption/jobs/relationships/friendships lol. A lot of people wanting gumbo & chicken recipes. Too much to type out but I use curry powder in a lot of things to give it some good flavor(that's how my mom does it). White pepper is essential for that good good fried chicken flavor     (original post) I(21m) am from the south. I grew up in New Orleans and Texas. My mom runs a catering business and the majority of clients were either at home in Louisiana or in Texas. I add this to say that I grew up cooking and helping my mom cook for the business. I was frying chicken and catfish when I could reach the stove and making gumbo and buttermilk biscuits at a very young. I'm currently in culinary school right now.   I've lived in a rented house on the east coast with my roommate(22m) for a year and a half. He's not a friend or anything. We just linked up because we both needed roommates in the area. He's good to live with and we watch shows and movies together. We hang out and go out for drinks sometimes. I always make friends easy because of being from the south and doing customer service related things since I was a kid. I know how to talk and charm and listen to folk despite being naturally more in the introverted spectrum. My roommate has been seeing his girlfriend(20m) for like 6 months. I've met her before and seen her in passing. Roommate and his gf had a 2 week break from school things. She still lives at her parents so she decided to stay here the whole two weeks.  I was just doing things as I would normally do. It got weird at first when I was about to go mow the lawn and the roommate stopped me and said he wanted to mow(I usually always mow.) A couple of days later I was outside washing my car. I asked both of them if they wanted me to do theirs. She looked like she was going to agree but he looked at her angrily so they declined.   I cook pretty frequently at home as well and usually let my roommate have some. So any time I'd make some I would say that they could have some and this would get him pissed. Weeks prior when she was here and we were all talking. She mentioned this specific kind of cheesecake that she really likes. So I made and sent out a group text that everyone could have it. My roommate got upset. I don't see anything as overstepping a boundary as this is how I treat him and all guests. The other day he told me how annoying it was to hear his gf talk about how good your roommate can fresh baked bread is. I'm not trying to make him look bad or anything. This is simply how i was raised. If I bake two loaves of bread I'm gonna leave it out for the house to eat.  EDIT- The cheesecake is just common courtesy type thing to me. When his parents come over i make pound cake because they like it. If a guest is coming you get/make what they like. Nothing odd about picking up their favorite chips or making some tea when guests arrive. Just how I was raised  EDIT- Wow this has blown up. Just want to say we generally have a good roommate relationship. We're not best friends but it's friendly enough. The only change has been when his gf is here. So lol no I am not looking to for new roommates/to be adopted/or to move but thanks. Here is some more things that upset him.  I went to the grocery store and asked if anyone needed anything  I was frying chicken and offered the first/best pieces out the oil to them  I changed the oil to my own car  I used a smoker in the backyard to make brisket  I grill and smoke in the backyard and needed a piece of wood cut into a certain way to hold something up. I cut and nailed some wood together in the garage.  Feels like I can't even exist while she is here  FINAL EDIT- I tend to see the good and best in people. So I was not seeing him as being very insecure and was trying to look at this in a more positive light. But he just texted me and said that I  greet his gf in too kind of a way and it's annoying that I say be safe when she leaves the house(I say this to him and everyone when they they tell me they are going somewhere). He sent me a long text detailing it's bad that I look her in the eyes when she is talking to me??? Maybe it is time for a new roommate  ",

        "selftext": "To start, my fiance is willing and happy to take my last name-- he grew up with a horrible father. He has no attachment to his last name and no siblings. I have a very unique last name and a strong attachment to it.  I brought this up to my father and he said wasn't so sure about it, given my brother is the only male in the family who would carry on the name. My brother found out before I could bring it up to him and called me, saying I was being inconsiderate and couldn't believe he hadn't been asked. This got me irritated, because in my opinion, I have just a right to share my name as he did with his wife. He and his wife have been married for over a year and I think they feel possessive about the fact they were the only ones supposed to carry on our name. I think the fact that this is an issue at all is rather sexist. It's my last name too and if I want to give my future husband--who has never had the privilege of feeling like he belongs to a family-- my name, no one should take issue. I have three sisters who aren't yet married, but they shouldn't have to feel bad about giving their name either. I don't feel like I'm being selfish here, but AITA for breaking tradition? *UPDATE*  Did not expect this to blow up! My father and brother are amazing people and husbands\u2014I think they were caught off guard by my thinking more than anything else. I\u2019ve let it go for now, but will bring it up again simply to explain my thinking and I believe they will understand. They are rational, empathetic human beings, if a little old school sometimes :)  As for my fianc\u00e9\u2014 he is absolutely amazing and all my family approves . When I originally brought up keeping my last name, he was the one who suggested taking mine as well. He\u2019s perfectly secure in his masculinity for all those wondering lmao. Thank you for all the encouragement! My fianc\u00e9 and I will be rocking our kickass last name soon enough.",

        "selftext": "Throwaway account  I (24f) gave birth to my daughter six months ago and it should've been the happiest moment in my life. When my daughter was born her skin was very dark and looked like she could have two biological parents who were of African descendent. My husband Jim (26m), fake name, was furious and accused me of cheating and left right then and there. He told everyone on both sides of the family what happened, made posts on social media and wanted a divorce. His family and a lot of our friend all called to say how upset they were at me and called me really nasty names. My mother was by my side the entire time and I kept professing my innocence. Jim refused to pick me up from the hospital, threw my stuff out on the lawn and changed the locks, so I had to stay with my parents. When my sister called to ask for the baby stuff Jim texted me pictures of the bare nursery room and said he got rid of everything. He even destroyed my Art studio, I like to paint, and the art I made and told me my work would be too awful to sell. I was distraught and tried to focus on my baby. Weeks went by and Jim refused to speak to me directly and has never once asked about our child. Eventually he agreed to do a paternity and he was 100% the father. No one could believe the results and it was done again, Jim's the dad. Around that same time one of Jim's cousins did the Ancestry thing and there was around 30% of African ancestry in the family. This combined with the test Jim paternal great-grandmother admitted to having an affair around the time Jim's grandfather was born and was because he could pass she just assumed her husband was the father. Since then Jim has been reaching out and everyone has come to apologize, and while it did feel good to feel vindicated the damage has been done. I can't un-hear or unsee all the horrible things that was said and done. Not just to me but to my child as well. Jim made some very racist remarks. Things that I thought he'd never say and he did it so easily. Regardless of what our daughter looks like I don't want her to be around that. What else will Jim and his family say or do the next time they get mad? How are they going to treat our daughter when she does something that upsets them? Jim has been begging for forgiveness. I said I needed time, he asked to see the baby and I let him but I'm too afraid to physically hand her to him. He's repairing the the nursery and keeps asking me what I would like and I cry every time saying we already had what I liked and some of the items that we had can't be replaced. He asked me if I still loved him and I admitted that he showed me his worst self and I don't know if I could live with that image. I didn't mean to be hurtful but it's how I feel. My sister suggested Couple's Therapy but I don't feel like I should have to work to fix something that I didn't break. I've never cheated and have been 100% innocent in all of this the whole. AITA for not wanting to give Jim a second chance? Update 1: I stepped away for a few hours and couldn't believe what I came back to. I am truly amazed by all the wonderful comments of support as well as the private messages. I also understand why some people may think this is fake and all I can say is that you are free to believe what you want in this. I also see some questions and I think I should clarify a few things just in case your judgement may change. 1. All of this initially happened at the near February and I was already settled at my parents' house before the pandemic hit.2. One of the reasons Jim wouldn't pick me up from the hospital was because I wouldn't admit to cheating or give him any details, because there weren't any which made him angrier.3. Based on the pictures Jim sent me he didn't take a sledgehammer to the crib or anything. He just took stuff down to either return it for the money or gave it away. While deeply hurtful I wouldn't call it violent, but maybe it is.4. Online he announced that I pushed out a dark skinned baby and was going to he was divorce me. His family started with the racial comments and eventually he started doing it too but only through my family, he refused to speak to me directly.5. Once the truth came out everything he and his family posts were all taken down but I, and a few friends, still have the screenshots. Jim never wrote down his racial remarks.6. While he didn't say any of the racist words he did make comments about our daughter being a Welfare Princess, and how I was going to be just another baby mama.7. Just to clarify. Jim is white and I am at least half white. One of my parents is adopted and with everything that's happened they decided to do the Ancestry thing too and we should be getting the results any day now. Update 2: Spelling Errors   Update 3:    Mod denied separate post so it's here as an edit. Thank you so for all your words of encouragement a couple months back, both in posts and the DMs. A lot of things have happened since my initial post and I just needed time to process it and be in a place where I can write about on social media. So here it goes.... First, my parent who was adopted did the Ancestry/23 thing and it turns out that Jim wasn't the only one who had African ancestry. My parent had at least 45%, which means I have at least 20%. I am legally separated from my husband with primary custody, and I'm living with my parents until further notice. He still keeps apologizing and wants me to come back to the house, he even offered to leave so I could stay with our daughter but I don't want to and really like having the support of my parents. My dad is retired so he does a lot of the babysitting while my mother and I work remotely. I do go to the house every so often so Jim can see his daughter and for Couple's Counseling via telecom. In one of the sessions Jim confessed something really hurtful and some of you guessed right, he cheated. It was while we were dating, before he proposed, and his treatment towards me was a projection. It was with an ex-girlfriend who had cheated on him and he hooked up with her as an ego boost. He started to feel guilty but was too scared that I would walk away to ever confess. Jim also admitted that he was scared when I got pregnant (our baby wasn't planned), was very anxious about being a father, but just pretended to be excited because he didn't want to look like an A. My husband was so willing to believe that our daughter wasn't his because he thought he had an out. Now that he knows that our child is his and has spent time with her Jim regrets everything and just wants his family back and is willing to spend the rest of his life making it up to us. This was all deeply hurtful and I've cried about it more than once. Jim has been lying to me and my ability to trust him hasn't improved at all. When the holidays came around Jim's parents asked about seeing their grandchild and I didn't want to. They told me that it was selfish of me to keep her away and I reminded them of their past. They said that they've already apologized and tried to minimize the situation. They said that I can't be angry forever and that I need to learn to forgive them. I'm so ashamed of ever loving and marrying into this family and wonder why I didn't see this before. I've decided to contact a lawyer and will be filing for divorce after my daughter's first Birthday.",

        "selftext": "My daughter had a spelling test which included some holiday words for extra credit. One of the words was Chanukah. My daughter spelled it the way I just did, but the teacher marked it wrong and corrected it to Hanukkah. She said to my daughter you're Jewish and you don't know how to spell Hanukkah? I think she meant it jokingly but my daughter was annoyed. My daughter told the teacher that Chanukah is correct, but the teacher didn't believe her. I told the teacher that Chanukah was also correct and that my daughter should get the point, and the teacher argued with me, saying that Hanukkah is more correct because it's more commonly used than Chanukah. I said if any spelling is more correct it would be Chanukah because the Ch represents the sound from the back of the throat you're supposed to make. The teacher agreed to correct the test but seemed really sour about it and said she was just trying to be inclusive. I said I appreciate that but she should keep in mind that if the word isn't in English that there might be multiple acceptable spellings for it and that they should all be given credit. My husband says I overreacted. Honestly I probably wouldn't have bothered so much if the word was something else, but I resented the teacher, who isn't Jewish, arguing with me and my daughter about how to spell our own holiday.",

We're all in our early 20s and have had our fair share of romance in life. The topic of sex popped up and we start talking about some of our past experiences. One guy joked about how having sex only made his dick bigger and bigger. We all laughed and he said that he wished that's how it works. My female friend (let's call her Sarah) piped up and said Yeah, for women, it's the complete opposite. The more sex you have, the bigger your labia gets and the looser you become. There were some chuckles, but then I asked her if she was serious. She said she was. Now, this is a big myth. I was surprised a woman who has had some experience actually believes that. I basically told her this, and then she started getting annoyed, asking how me and my dick knows about that. I said the same way I know anything about female anatomy- I've read up on it. The whole women get looser thing is something sexist dudes made up to slut-shame women. My other friends were silent on this. She then just said: Whatever, I'm not in the mood for your mansplaining. So I'm at a loss here. AITA for explaining something that I feel like people should just know about?",

She remarried when he was 14. I did when he was 16.  I had an RESP set up for him. That's a education fund in Canada. As long as he went for post secondary education he could use the money for anything.  I always told him that I was okay with him not going to university. That way I could use the money I had saved up for him to go to Belgium and buy some beer from monks that only allow you to buy one case. He knew I was joking and he always played along. He wouldn't let me get his goat.  When he got accepted to McGill it was the proudest moment of my life.

Her husband is a decent enough person but he made it clear that he wasn't responsible for any expenses for my son. Beyond food and shelter and stuff obviously. Like I said he is decent.  I said I was not going to do that. I was going to go drink beer in my son's honour.  She says I'm wasting thousands of dollars. And I guess I am.

        "selftext": "My wife was a corporate lawyer and mediator. She had some very nice work clothes. She was diagnosed with ovarian cancer and was gone in two years. The last six months of her life were hell.  My sister Sarah didn't do jack shit for us of us during that time. My wife never liked her. I do not like her. She is a selfish cow. At my wife\u2019s wake, she started asking about my wife\u2019s clothes, and I brushed her off. She wanted to pick out a few pieces to \u201cremember my wife by,\u201d and I ignored her.  It's been six months, and I've attended my mom\u2019s birthday, but I\u2019m still not in the mood to deal with people. Then Sarah comes, asking about my wife\u2019s clothes.  I told her my wife wanted me to donate them to this women's shelter, and she often helped. It will help women in need with their own court cases, court appointments, and job interviews.  My sister Sarah said my wife was even selfish in death. I asked her what the fuck did she mean? And she started going off on how my wife always thought she was better than her, and it's not far that the clothes are going to charity and not to family.  I told my sister I would rather see my wife\u2019s clothes lit on fire than on her back. My sister started crying, and my mom came over to see what was wrong. My mom told me to be easy on my sister because she was talking about my wife\u2019s death hard.  The fucking insanity of that coming out of my mom\u2019s mount made me grab my gift and leave. My mom acts like I had to ruin her birthday by being melodramatic, but I cannot believe their emotional blackmail towards me over fucking clothes that they have no right to. ",

His 2 daughters thought the same thing, but he's broke as a joke and I've got a trust fund, so actually no.    He's broke because his late wife got cancer. 3 times. He ran up 6 credit cards, 2^(nd) mortgage on the house, cashed out his retirement, everything and anything to get her the treatment she needed and then to get treatment enough to see both daughters married.    His daughters live 6hrs drive away.    We drove to them for Xmas last year and the year before. They ignored me, dragged Tim away when he tried to include me and prevented their husbands from making even small talk with me by talking over me.    Year 1 Tim chastised them, they apologized (to him, not me) They blamed the pain of seeing their Dad with a woman who wasn't their Mum.  Year 2, they did it again.    This year I told Tim not again.  He could go, I would never ask him not to see his daughters for Xmas but I'll stay here.    Tim didn't love the idea because me going with him means we can share the responsibility of driving when his back starts to bother him. (He hates to fly)  His 2010 deathtrap is starting to go anyway, so I leased him a comfy luxury ride (my brother has a dealership)    He called the girls, super excited that he'd be able to see them more often without having to worry about his back,, who then blew up and accused him of spending their Mothers money on a \u201cbull**** house and car to impress some bimbo bartender and didn't offer them a dime for their weddings\u201d    In the ensuing argument it came out that they assumed there had been a life insurance policy, nor did they have any idea about the credit card debt or the 2^(nd) mortgage that the house was underwater on or that Tim was looking at foreclosure and bankruptcy until he moved in with me.    They did not realize it was my house, that he pays no bills save the water bill (man takes excessive showers) and shared groceries.    Now the girls want my number. They are sorry I \u201cfelt lonely\u201d at Xmas. They want to come visit and stay with us next year! Conveniently in summer, I live near a beach.    I've told Tim absolutely not about giving out my number. I'm happy to be polite if they come to visit Tim but, we're not going to be friends. If they had talked to me for even 2 seconds they'd have understood. I am not shy about admitting the only thing I have ever contributed to my blessed financial state is \u201cnot developing a crippling coke addiction\u201d like my cousin Danny did.   Tim thinks I'm being too unforgiving. They would have warmed up to me eventually but knowing how generous I am being with their Father has made them warm up quicker.    I maintain I don't care about now or later, they had their chance to not be catty brats over incorrect assumptions that I was taking advantage of him.",

        "selftext": "I'm (18m) graduating high school at the end of this month. My dad dropped the bomb on me two nights ago that his stepdaughter (14f) has an award ceremony for some competition she entered and won in another state on that same day and that she really wants him to be there. He told me he couldn't possibly make it to both and since his wife and their children together will be going, he needs to be there too. He told me he would make it up to me and we could celebrate another time. I still live with him (not for much longer). My mom died when I was 7 and my dad got married again when I was 11 or 12. It's been a few years anyway. His stepdaughter never knew her bio dad, so my dad has accepted her as his own. And he has prioritized her a lot in the last 5/6 years. It doesn't always show in the most obvious ways but it can be felt. Father/son time was put on an indefinite hiatus and instead dad told me we needed to include her in our time together but he also spent time with just her for father/daughter time. I brought it up to my dad and he told me I wasn't exactly making an effort to be closer to her so he wanted us all to bond and didn't want me to just focus on my relationship with him. He has attended her dance things instead of my basketball games if they're on at the same time. It doesn't matter if mine was known about first, he will still skip my stuff to go to hers. He will take us on family days and whenever he and his wife say kids can choose he picks her choices over mine. He claims it's because they will be the most fun for everyone but really, he even says it afterward, anything his little princess wants. Our refrigerator and our shower broke at the same time. His stepdaughter's birthday was coming up so he took money from my birthday fund to pay for that stuff and so his stepdaughter would definitely get what she wanted (this barbie house thing and a whole fashion set and they were I think dad said $250). He didn't get all the money back by the time my birthday came around so instead he bought me a $30 gift card for Steam when he had promised me a new monitor and keyboard for my computer (that was a gift from my grandparents). When my dad told me he wouldn't be at my graduation to go and support her, I told him there is no making up for that and he can forget about being included in my life going forward. He told me he would make it up to me and I told him I will always come second to his little princess and I'm not going to be okay with that. I told him he's discarded me for the last time. Dad begged me to be reasonable but I walked away. Then I invited both sets of grandparents who agreed to come. His wife told me I could have come with them and I don't need to attend the ceremony but could support my sister. I said her daughter's not my sister and I do not want to support their family anymore and I will be out of their hair soon. She called me selfish and told me I can't deny her daughter a dad.  AITA?",

I have over 400 bottles at this point, I take great pride in my collection, and I use it. I\u2019m also happy to give people decants (samples) of most of my bottles, let them sample a spray or two, give some bottles as gifts, etc.  What I have a HUGE fucking issue with is my 17 year old niece coming into my home under the guise of walking my dog, decanting bottles on her own and SELLING THE SAMPLES to her little friends. She thinks that because I have so many bottles, I wouldn\u2019t notice some missing or getting massive dents in them. Well little miss entrepreneur failed to realize that her \u201cprivate\u201d Instagram wasn\u2019t \u201cfriends only\u201d or whatever and I saw each and every fucking story with each price and sample she had. I tallied that shit up and got a pretty good estimate based on cost per ounce. Thankfully she mostly picked the \u201cTiktok famous\u201d perfumes like Bianco Latte and Escapade Gourmand and didn\u2019t go for the most rare, niche perfumes. She did snatch an entire 2.5 oz bottle of Baccarat Rouge, though, which runs $300+ at most retailers, as well as full bottles of perfumes you can get at Sephora. Like Marc Jacobs Daisy, Burberry Her Elixir, Flowerbomb, etc.  Petty or not, I printed out the entire list of what she\u2019d taken, price estimate, and handed it off to my sister (her mom). I said that I expect to be paid back, in full. And of course her fucking sneaky little ass is never allowed in my home again. My sister got super pissy with me going on about how my niece is just a kid, kids make mistakes, etc. I said yes, kids make mistakes, and this is a GREAT way for my niece to learn from hers. Their argument is that now the money she was going to use for a car has to go towards paying me back. I don\u2019t care. She is lucky that I have no interest in involving the police, small claims, or any of that. But AITA, because she IS a teenager?",

        "selftext": "Throwaway.  So my husband comes from a 'traditional' family. Mum's a SAHM, father was sole provider. I come from the opposite - my mother pretty much forbade from ever being financially dependent on a man and drilled that into me early on.  My husband worked hard to unlearn the values he saw replicated at home. He (often more than) pulled his weight at home, was an engaged and present father and a genuine partner. The one thing that grinds my gears is how much weight he puts on the opinions of his family. I get that we all want our parents to be proud of us, but this is too much. My ILs are staying with us for 2 weeks. Our usual MO is, I prep breakfast, we all eat lunch at work/school, and my husband makes dinner. We have a cleaner, but she's on holiday so in the meantime we're DIYing the cleaning where it's down to everyone to keep their space clean and common spaces we all clean. This is how we've always done it, and it works.  My ILs hate that I'm 'one of those modern women'. They hate that I work, they hate that I don't find my purpose in being a wife and mother and they hate that my husband pulls his weight at home. We spoke pretty frankly early on, where I established my boundaries and told them I won't be chastised about how I live my life in my home. When I am a guest in their home, I accommodate their ways and play the DIL they wish I was. They have for the most part respected this.  I got home yesterday after work tired and starving. I typically get home 1815/30 and we eat at 1900. I said quick hellos and ran up for a pre-dinner shower. When I came down, I went to the kitchen to help set up for dinner and found nothing ready. I asked my husband about it but he wouldn't look at me and his mother answered that he hadn't cooked anything. She told me I needed to do my duty as a wife and cook for my family. My coward of a husband still wasn't looking at me. I just walked away and ordered takeaway. I dished up for me and my kids and we sat at the table to eat. My husband and his parents served themselves and joined us.  My MIL was still going on about what was wrong with me and why I was a failure. I asked my husband if he had anything to say. He said his mother had a point and it wouldn't hurt if I acted 'more like a proper woman' and 'took better care of my home and children'. He said tradition was tradition for a reason and it was kind of insulting that I thought I was too good for how he was raised.  This is where I might be the asshole. I told him tradition won't allow a man on 35k to support a family of 5 and he was too broke to be so sexist. He looked hurt and I saw tears welling in his eyes. He excused himself from the table. I regret saying this in front of our children, but him saying that to me after I'm busting my ass to clean up his mess on top of having to deal with his parents was too much for me. AITA.  ",

        "selftext": "My husband Peter (29 m) and I (27 f) have been married for about three years. We have one child together and I was pregnant with our second. I\u2019m western Canadian while he is from Germany. We lived in Canada for a long time, but because of inflation moving back to Germany seemed like a better option for us. We bought a nice house in Hannover where Peter is from.\u00a0 The day after our flights to Germany we all visited Peter\u2019s family. This was the second time I have seen them (the first was at our wedding). They greeted us and brought us inside of the house, fussing over my son. We had dinner, and soon we left the house, wanting to settle into our new home. We visited Peter\u2019s family often for the next few months. But I had started to realize that they would sometimes speak about me in German. They would make rude comments on my hair and makeup, question my fashion choices, and overall were just very unkind to me. They also said mean things about my pregnant belly which I was already insecure about. I ended up talking to my husband about this. I told him that I didn\u2019t like the way that they were treating me. I said that I hated how my every choice was judged. He told me that he would talk to his family.\u00a0 The next time that we went to his parents house, there were no more mean comments. For about three months it was like nothing ever happened. I gave birth to a perfect baby girl that we named Lilith. Peter\u2019s family was very upset when they heard the name. If you didn\u2019t know, Lilith means \u201cghost\u201d or \u201cof the night.\u201d We didn\u2019t pick this name because of its meaning, but because it is a name that every girl in my family has had for many years. My middle name is Lilith, along with my moms, my grandma\u2019s, and even my great grandma's.\u00a0 For a while I didn\u2019t visit my in-laws. I didn\u2019t want to hear them talk about how I shouldn\u2019t have named my daughter Lilith. But yesterday we saw them again. It was my mother-in-law\u2019s birthday. As soon as we showed up things started to go badly. Everybody wanted to hold Lilith which made my MIL upset because people weren\u2019t paying attention to her and made me overwhelmed. I didn\u2019t want people holding her. I was going through a pretty bad postpartum depression and it was still pretty early to see people. I let people look at her, but declined when anyone asked to hold her. During dinner I heard my SIL talking to my MIL in German. I heard her complaining about how she couldn\u2019t hold my baby. My SIL even had the audacity to call me, and I quote, \u201ca fat ugly hokey addict.\u201d I turned to my SIL and MIL and told them off in German. I basically said that I have always known what they have said about me, but calling me names was the last straw. I also mentioned how I have known German for almost my whole life. The table instantly blew up. People were yelling at me because apparently this was all my fault. I left with Peter and we haven\u2019t talked to them since. So AITH? ",

Last year I (17f) officially changed my first name from Evelyn to Indie (which was a nickname form of my original middle name). My parents gave in after realizing how serious I was about being Indie and how I was not warming up to or growing into Evelyn.  My brother and Hailey want an older/vintage name for their baby and Hailey asked me about 5 months ago why I disliked Evelyn enough to change the name. At the time she brought up how popular the name has become and how vintage is back. I told her I didn't like vintage names and to me it sounded really old fashioned. I told her the popularity didn't influence my decision. She wanted to know my reason for disliking older names and why I liked something like Indie instead. I didn't mind her asking this first time. She brought it up again a week later and she asked the same question and pressed more for why. She asked a third and a fourth time. I gave her the same answer and asked her why she kept asking me. I told her my answer wasn't going to change. By the seventh time she asked she admitted she was worried her baby would hate having an older name and wanted to figure out what she could do to prevent what happened with me happening to her. She also said she'd like me to rethink my name because she thought Evelyn was beautiful and she was sad I had chosen something like Indie over it. I asked her to stop so many times already and I even asked my brother to stop her. He told me I needed to understand it was the hormones. I can easily say she has asked me this more than 25 times by now. I'm not exaggerating that number either. Two weeks ago when she brought it up again she felt like I had made a mistake changing my name and how 30 year old me wouldn't be so against Evelyn. I told her 30 year old me can deal with it if that happens. She told me I didn't really have a good reason to like the name and Indie seemed like the kind of name someone young likes but not someone older. Then yesterday happened and I kinda lost my temper. She started out asking the same stuff and the baby is almost ready to be born so I know it's coming to an end but she asked me to really think about why and help her because she couldn't figure out what she'd do differently than my parents did. Then she said they really shouldn't have let me change my name so young. I snapped and I told her to stop asking me the same question because my answer won't change and her comments are not changing my mind because I don't like old fashioned names. I told her I think they're awful and I'm sick and tired of hearing about how much better they are and having her try to make me find a reason she finds acceptable. I told her just like she hates Indie, I hate Evelyn and she needs to let it fucking go already. She burst into tears and my brother got so mad at me. My parents were also like why did I have to speak to her so harshly. AITA? ",

Last weekend, Dan, one of the people from the group, told me about a casual dinner . I told him how if Susan or Greg were there I wouldn't be able to come. He tells me that they would be there but I should just put my opinions aside and come just once. This is kind of where I might be an AH. I agreed with him and told him I would be there. I show up and we all get to talking. Everyone began putting in their orders, most of them spent about $40. There were only about 6 people there. When it gets to Susan and Greg, they both order expensive dishes, around $200. When it was my turn to order, everyone looked at me, but I just pick up the menu and point to the $4 Miller Lite and sent the waiter away. Dan asked why I hadn't ordered anything and all I said was that I lost my appetite. The other 2 friends got up as well to cancel their orders and just have drinks. After the main courses came out, I saw Susan and Greg picking at their food. The waiter then brings over the check. Greg then grabs the waiter and asks him to split the check 6 ways. I stand up and correct him saying the check was to be split 3 ways. Greg looks at me confused and asks why since we always split the bill. I reminded him that 3 of us had not eaten any food so we would just be paying for our drinks.  So basically at the end of the night, Dan, who probably only ate around $50 worth of food, was stuck with a $146.98 check at the end. (Yes, I remember the exact number.) I swear I saw his jaw drop when he picked that receipt up. I slid a $10 towards the check, said goodbye everyone, and walked out. The next morning, I found my phone full of texts from Greg and Susan telling me I was an AH for not ordering any food and forcing them to pay  more than they had accounted for. I honestly laughed because the steaks alone were more than what they had paid  but to each their own right? I also got a lot of messages from Dan saying that I could have just not came instead of pulling that stunt and getting him stuck with an outrageous bill. Edit: At this restaurant, the bar is separate so drinks are on a separate bill if that makes sense. And if anyone is concerned about leaving a tip, I live in Australia. Edit 2: Hey guys just wanted to clarify some things: 1. 90% of restaurants where I live they don't do separate checks and might separate the bill for you if you're lucky. BTW. This post is in AUD, so if you want the amounts in USD, you have to convert it.2. Dan could have easily asked Greg and Susan to transfer him the money if he wanted but he's always been about helping them through their financial hardship even though they're just using him and keeps dragging me into it. I admit what I did was immature but I'm tired of being forced to play along. It's his money and if he wants to spend it on them, that's fine, but I'm not paying for them.3. Also Dan's a really good friend of mine, albeit blind AF. I was just trying to get him to see what kind of people he was helping. I will admit it was a tad bit petty.4. Thank you for the gold.",

        "selftext": "So there's this new Target commercial going around where a little girl dresses as a hot dog, and it came on while my family was watching a scary movie. I (20F) am home from college for the weekend and brought my boyfriend, and my mother (57F) decided it would be hilarious to mention that she'd made me a hot dog costume as a kid, except the way she told the story, it was my request. She said that all the girls wanted to be Disney princesses, but I had asked to be a hot dog, and so she'd gone out of her way to make me that costume.  This is not what happened, and I said as much. What actually happened is that I wanted to be Snow White, and had told everyone, including the teachers, that I was going to be Snow White. I was obsessed with that movie as a kid, to the point where I would actually get invested in doing chores because I was cleaning up just like Snow White. My dad and I would watch that movie all the time, and I was very excited to be Snow White for Halloween, especially because my ballet studio was doing a special princess dance, for Halloween and we'd all signed up for special princess slots, and I'd shown up early with my dad the week before so I could get to be Snow White.  My mother decided that she wanted to be quirky and that Snow White was a bad role model after I got in trouble for trying to cook dinner for my family. I was about eight, and I tried to make hot dogs, like how she made food for the dwarves in the movie, and I made a mess. My mom surprised me on the day of with this crappy hot dog suit, and told me if I didn't wear it she'd never let me watch Snow White again. She took a million pictures, the other girls teased me for months, and it was one of the most humiliating moments of my childhood.  I told the real story, and mentioned that I got through the day by pretending that she was the evil queen making me dress in rags, but the rags happened to be a garbage meat costume. She got really quiet after that, and after we left, my brother says she was crying and looking at the pictures from that Halloween. I didn't want to make my mom cry, but it's a shitty memory for me and it felt like she was trying to humiliate me all over again in front of my boyfriend.  TL;DR: I called my mom out for forcing me to be a hot dog for Halloween and humiliating me as a child after she brought up the story pretending I'd wanted to be. AITA?",

We usually stay at all inclusive resorts but I have always wanted to go on a cruise.  I told my parents it was different and that if we went on excursions we had to follow the schedule no matter what.  Well it was a week-long cruise and they would not head back to the ship when I said it was time to go. They were busy shopping and bargaining with the locals. I finally said that I was heading back to the ship. My mom waved me off.  The missed the departure. By a lot. Like 45 minutes. They got ahold of me through WhatsApp. They wanted to know why I didn't get the boat to wait for them.   I wanted to scream that they were not going to inconvenience 3,998 people because two could not understand what a schedule was.  They ended up having to fly to the next port from there and it was expensive. They are pissed at me for leaving them behind.  I don't know what I was supposed to do. They literally told me that they knew what they were doing.  I wish I had never asked for this.  They are making me miserable because I left without them. ",

        "selftext": "I bought a house in a community without an HOA I wanted my home to be MY home, and that includes making it look the way that I want. I also chose a neighborhood that already has fun, colorful houses instead of just plain earth tones. I finally got to the point where I could repaint my house. I picked a soft peachy color with sage, blue, and soft and dark pink accents. Fun and colorful without being too out there. I think if you google \u201ccoolors blue sage peach\u201d you\u2019ll see a similar palette. My neighbor Paul fucking hates it and has been complaining since we started the project. He also made his opinion known that he hates our front lawn (lots of wildflowers and sunflowers, fun garden flags, a Little Free Library, etc).  Each and every time, I\u2019ve told him that I don\u2019t care. Truly, I don\u2019t. And I\u2019ve suggested a few times that maybe he\u2019d be happier in a HOA community that has control over everything and forces people into having earth toned homes. Paul got angry when I suggested that and said he\u2019s lived in his home for 15 years and shouldn\u2019t have to move. I told him okay, well you\u2019ll have to learn to live with a little color. Last weekend I was putting in pavers that my niece and I had painted together. They\u2019re all things like ladybugs, turtles, birds, etc in fun colors. I adore them and my niece is so excited she gets to be a part of my home. Paul came over to complain yet again, saying it was all an eyesore and my niece was here, so I just told him \u201cIt\u2019s time for you to grow up and get the fuck over what I\u2019m doing with my house.\u201d He got even pissier and told me that I have no right to talk to him this way, do I know who I\u2019m talking to, etc. I told him to just go away and get a fucking life. If he has so much free time to bitch and moan about a colorful house, maybe he should get a hobby. He stormed off, calling me a nasty piece of work. My niece was cracking up on the side. For the record, no one in my family is uptight, we really don\u2019t care about cursing. I know some people still clutch their pearls over it around kids (she\u2019s 15) but I\u2019m sure she says worse.  Anyway one of the other neighbors came to tell me that he\u2019s been flapping his yap about how disrespectful I am to talk to him like that. She told me that she knows he\u2019s a pain, but that he has been in the neighborhood forever and it\u2019s worth being nice to him. I don\u2019t know. Is telling him to get a life that big of a deal? AITA?",

        "selftext": "I don't normally post on reddit so please forgive me if I do this wrong.  I (33f) work in a very small, technical, specific, male dominated field. I won't give too much information on it as I think you could easily find my identity if I did, but let's just say it's a sub category of law.  I graduated 9 years ago (for anyone wondering, the system in my country is different than in the US so I only studied for 5 years), and am now a lawyer as well as a researcher. I published some work here and there but nothing too major, and no one outside of that field knows my work.  Yesterday I went to a bar with a couple of friends who introduced me to one of their friends who works in the same field as me. I was pretty excited to meet him because it's rare to meet people who work in that field. He doesn't exactly do the same thing as I do, he's not a lawyer but a legal advisor, but we work on the same topics. So naturally we started talking about our work.  At one point we were discussing a point on which we had different opinions, so I explained mine to him and he replied by saying that my opinion was based on nothing while his was based on the work of a professional (you guessed it, me). He basically started explaining my work to me, but in a completely wrong way and missed all of my points. I asked him if he was sure that that was what the author meant and he said that he was because it was pretty simple actually. For another good 20 minutes he explained all of it to me in details, like I was a first year law student. I didn't say anything because it was pretty funny to watch him say things that were completely wrong with so much confidence.  After that the topic changed and the night went on, but at the end of the night right before leaving I decided to tell him that I was actually the person that wrote the work he had quoted, and that he hadn't really understood it. He reacted very badly and got angry, and he told me that I had manipulated him to humiliate him. He yelled at me for not saying it was my work at the beginning. I simply replied that he had embarrassed himself and left.  I woke up this morning to texts from my friends saying I was wrong for causing drama and tension and that I could've been nicer to their friend. I'm not sure if I'm in the wrong there. I mean yes, I could've told him right away, but is it that big of a deal that I didn't? I'm not exactly sure. AITA?  Edit: I forgot to make this clear and maybe it's a bit of a misunderstanding, but both conversations happened only between the two of us. We were the only ones talking about our work and our friends also weren't really there when I told him that I was the author. So it's not like I publicly humiliated him. The only thing embarrassing for him here is that a woman seemed smarter than him, and I think that's what ge had an issue with. Edit 2: I've seen some comments claiming that this post was fake because that just doesn't happen, i've seen many other stories where the same thing happens, that's not realistic. I'm not trying to justify anything because I don't really care, but I just find it funny to see lots of comments from women sharing similar stories and then lots of comments from men saying it doesn't happen.

I didn\u2019t have any other projects on my to do list so I was happy to make it for her. I had most of the colors already too so it worked out. When I gave it to her she was excited and she started to look it over, I figured it was to see how it was put together, since she doesn\u2019t crochet. After a little bit she said that she loved the blanket, BUT she couldn\u2019t help but notice some of the little mistakes I\u2019d made along the way.

I told her that it was finished. She looked down at it and said that it wasn\u2019t done until it was perfect, and I\u2019d made several mistakes that I could easily go back to correct. I was honestly dumbfounded by this. I hate the way perfectionists try to force their quirk onto others. I made this blanket for her for free out of my own free time because I love her. I told her that. She said she knows and she loves me for it but that she wouldn\u2019t be able to use it because she wouldn\u2019t be able to focus on anything but the mistakes.

I typically spend most of my time at friends houses. I don't have extended family to rely on, they disowned my parents for having me so young, so friends houses were a positive in my life that made me feel more comfortable than being at home with my parents. My parents never did the typical parent stuff like helping with homework or showing up to support me at school. I don't think they ever attended a parents conference for me. They ignored a lot of stuff I needed to get signed and I'd have to get right in their face on the last day to get signatures. My birthday and Christmas have never been a big deal or celebration. They do celebrate their wedding anniversary but that's a them thing.

It started of with just name calling but has gotten worse over the past few weeks. Context: She\u2019s adopted, which is something we\u2019ve always been open about and celebrated as part of her story. Recently, some kids found out about her adoption and started saying horrible things \u2013 telling her stuff like her birth mother didn\u2019t want her. They tell her that she\u2019s unwanted tell her she a reject. ( which is not the case her mother loved her very much to the point she literally gave her life so she could be here)  If this wasn't bad enough  A few days ago, she came home in tears with her hair butchered  they\u2019d cut off 2 inch of her ponytail well in class all while taunting her names and laughing at her reaction.  They will follow her through the halls to make fun of her on a regular basis now. Both my husband and I have been in touch with the school about the bullying more times than I can count. I emailed, called, even showed up in person to speak with teachers and the principal, but all I got were empty promises that they\u2019d \u201clook into it.\u201d Nothing changed, and my daughter\u2019s mental health has taken a hit  she\u2019s anxious, struggling to sleep, and now begs us not to send her to school. Finally, out of frustration and feeling like no one was taking this seriously, we reached out to a lawyer to explore legal action against both the school and the bully\u2019s family. Only when the school and her parents learned we were considering a legal action did they start to act. Suddenly, the school calls me to say they\u2019re moving the bully out of my daughter\u2019s class and claim they \u201chad a talk\u201d with her. The girl\u2019s parents reached out too, saying they\u2019d \u201ctalk to their daughter\u201d and promised it would stop. But honestly, I don\u2019t believe them. It feels like they're all saying this just to get me to back off and avoid the legal consequences. I worry that once the dust settles, things will go right back to how they were, and my daughter will still be dealing with this. My family thinks I should give the school and parents a chance now that they\u2019re finally taking action, but I feel like it\u2019s all for show. So, AITA for moving forward with legal action even though the school and the bully\u2019s parents now claim they\u2019re handling it? ",

The person in the next seat had been upgraded and they asked if I could switch seat with their wife as they had just gotten married and were on their honeymoon.  I congratulated him on his nuptials and asked where his wife was sitting. He pointed towards the back of the plane. In economy.  I declined to switch seats. He asked if there was any way to convince me. I offered to switch if he paid the difference between the seats. It is a goodly amount. I had been lucky to get mine at a decent price. It would only have cost him $1,000 AU$.  He said  that they were on a budget for their honeymoon. I congratulated once again and put in my earbuds. He muttered that I was an asshole. I said he was a prick for taking the upgrade instead of either sitting with his wife or giving it to her.  I told my wife about the incident and she thinks I should have done the nice thing.  For the record she hates flying in economy so I know she would not have switched. ",

He has 2 kids 28-Madison and 26-Brett. Note I am not calling them my stepkids because they explicitly told me I am not their stepmom, just their dad's wife. I didnt play a part in raising them so Im ok with that. Its always been a tense between us, Ive tried my best to be kind to them and have been generous when I can be, but they are very cold with me. Being a child of divorce, I can partially relate to a parent moving on so I try not to force anything.\u00a0 Madison recently got engaged and we are excited about it. Everyone was over recently and she asked about a wedding budget from us and Rob told her he was able to contribute 10k. She has bigger hopes for her wedding than this so she was upset and kept asking for more. Rob however is still working hard on building his savings back up. Before his late wife died, he basically wiped out his cash savings, had to cash out his 401k, and even took a small mortgage on his house to cover medical costs as well as life expenses since he had to cut back on working. Eventually he had to drop that job for a more flexible but lower paying one, so this 10k is actually really generous from him. Rob went to run an errand and it was just me and his kids. Madison then asked me if Im going to give any in addition to what her dad is giving. I told her were a marital unit and thats what we discussed together as a reasonable amount to contribute. She then said I should have known, obviously you married an older man for what he had, not for what you could give. I knew she didnt like me but this is the most flat out rude thing she ever said. I kinda lost it and said excuse me, who do you think has been paying the second mortgage your dad took out to pay his debts?\u00a0 Truth of the matter is I make more than her father by a large margin, I have no debt, and have been paying 70% of the household bills the whole time we've been married. The 10k were giving her, is available because Ive been able to subsidize her father's living expenses the last few years. I made it clear that not only am I not a golddigger, Im literally wealthier than my older husband. She called me stuck up after this and stormed out. Then she called her dad later and said that I told her that I blamed her mother for being sick for her not having a better wedding budget. I told him what happened and he was mad at her but also said I shouldnt have shared his financial details with his kids.",

Recently, my mom (65F) came over to visit, and she noticed how stressed I was about the money situation. She offered some advice on how we could save money\u2014things like cutting down on takeout, meal prepping to avoid buying groceries multiple times a week, and switching to cheaper brands. My mom has always been frugal, especially when she was raising me and my siblings on a tight budget. I thought it made sense, especially since we\u2019re really trying to save wherever we can. I asked if she was willing to go through our spending and show where we could cut down. My wife agreed with this. She made a whole spreadsheet about our spending, and we are spending wayyyyy to much on fun stuff. We don\u2019t need Starbucks everyday and so on. It also became apparent that most of the fun spending was my wifes Tbh my wife didn\u2019t take the breakdown well and started arguing with my mom that her spreadsheet was wrong. She said that my mom\u2019s way of doing things is \u201coutdated\u201d and doesn\u2019t work for us. She doesn\u2019t want to give up buying organic produce, and she likes having variety in what we eat each week. I tried to explain that we need to make some sacrifices if we want to get out of this financial hole, but she kept insisting that things weren\u2019t as bad as I was making them out to be and that we just needed to \u201cride it out.\u201d My mom left at this point and we were still arguing, and she told me she can\u2019t give up her takeout . She also went on about my mom being wrong. That\u2019s when I lost my patience and said, \u201cYou\u2019re f***ing wrong. My mom is right. She managed to raise three kids on one income, and we can\u2019t even cut back on groceries for a few months? .\u201d My wife got really upset, saying I am being a huge jerk for winding with my mom and that my mom is outdated. She\u2019s barely spoken to me since, and now I\u2019m wondering if I went too far.

B have 3 (12M, 7M, 2F), the oldest and middle have the same disabilities as my older sister's children, and the younger have down syndrome. They are both SAHM, all the children are in the disability programs my country offers but there is not much money left, after all the medical bills of therapy and meds they need. Their husband's have ok jobs, but with the severity of the children's disabilities it is hard to go by.  On the other hand, I am single, child-free by choice, went to university, totally debt free, have a masters, and work from home in my dream field. Last month I bought my first house. I invited my family and friends for a house warming this Saturday. I paid for two caretakers to care for their children so they could come. Everything was fine and fun. Until the end of the night, my friends had already gone home, and it was the three of us. They started to talk about me setting down, marrying, and having kids, since I bought a house. I remembered that I didn't want kids. This talk circulated several times. Until they asked me why foi the tenth time. I told them, besides really not wanting to have a child, I love my freedom, I love the life that I already have. Thinking about our family DNA, that is a high chance of having a disabled child, that means more work and sacrificing, I don't want to sacrifice myself. I want to have money for hobbies, to take care of myself, for expensive clothes and hairdressers, to travel, to live and not just survive. I love them, they're great mom's but I don't want to make the sacrifices to be the same, I would be an awful and spiteful mom, and no one deserves that. From everything I said, the only thing they listened to was about not wanting a disabled child. They went on a spiral about how much of a blessing their kids are, how I am an egotistical bitch, and so much more. They blocked me on social media, and aren't answering me in the family group chat. My mom called to give me a speech about how my disabled brother (36M)was a blessing in her life, how he is a gift from God, and uninvited me from christmas because my sisters won't come if I come. I called my brother (39), his two children are adopted. He admitted a long time ago this was due to the high chance of disability in our family. He told me my delivery is rude, but they also suck, they should know not everyone wants kids. He encouraged me to apologize because I know how they are. ",

Jenna inserted herself right here and asked Ian if he was going to be out the next day and he said yes. She started panicking and saying that he couldn\u2019t and she wasn\u2019t ready to spend an evening alone. I was going to tell her that she could still hang out here while we gone and she looked at me and said \u201cdon\u2019t you have any fucking friends you can go with?\u201d And I just blew tf up\u2026. \u201cdon\u2019t *you* have any other fucking friends you can go bother?\u201d and so on; she called me selfish for \u201cmonopolizing *my husband*\u201d and I had enough and told her to get the fuck out of my house and not to come back, ever.  Ian had been trying to calm things down between us but it spiraled out of control fast and he ended up escorting Jenna out and telling her that he\u2019d come visit her in a few days but he would be backing my decision because of how she spoke to me. I was happy for his support and still am but it\u2019s been a few days and I just feel bad all around about it. I should\u2019ve been more understanding of her but I also feel like she should treat me more respectfully and I\u2019m not really sure if I overreacted ",

        "selftext": "I was taking pictures at a family wedding as a favor. I was being paid about half of what I normally charge and I was fine with it. The bride is my favorite cousin and her husband is amazing.  During the formals the wedding party was great and I got lots of great shots.  When it came time to take pictures of different family groups with the couple people were assholes. They wouldn't stop talking or looking away from the camera. I tried politely reminding everyone that the camera was the big black thing on the tripod and that it took still images not video. I was repeatedly told to shut up and stop being a smartass and that they knew what a camera was.  I asked my wife to record video of the responses for me.  My cousin was delighted with the pictures from the ceremony, the formals, and the reception. She laughed her ass off at the family pictures. In about half of them people are looking off in all directions instead of at the camera. In most of those there are also people with their mouths open.  She thought they were hilarious and her husband agreed.  I started getting shit on social media from my family about the terrible pictures. I replied that I had tried to explain to them that the camera was the big black thing on the tripod and that it only took still pictures. They said I should have waited for them to be ready. So I started posting the short video clips of people being jackasses towards me.  My mom said that I went to far and that they won't ask me to take pictures for them again. A did a fake cry and said boo hoo. She called me a smart Alec.  Please let me state that I DO NOT THINK I AM THE ASSHOLE IN THIS SITUATION. But many people do. They are upset because they don't often dress up and get together and they didn't get good pictures. ",

        "selftext": "I have two friends: Gaby and Shelly. All of us are 23, if that matters. We were roommates in college and stayed in the same city after graduation. While the three of us are close, I\u2019ve always known that Gaby and Shelly are the closest. They have a really sweet friendship. Shelly is getting married. Gaby is the maid of honor and I\u2019m one of the bridesmaids. Over the weekend, I went with Shelly so she could look at wedding dresses. Gaby was supposed to come with us but got called into work last minute. I helped Shelly pick out some dresses then she went with the consultant to try them on. Shelly asked that I take pictures and videos on her phone to send to her mom and Gaby. I was getting the camera ready when a text from Gaby came through. I didn\u2019t mean to click on it and was instantly going to click back out when I saw one of my Instagram pictures in their private chat from earlier that morning. Both were making fun of me for the face I was making and my outfit choice. It didn\u2019t appear to be very good nature. I admit, curiosity got the best of me so I searched my name in the chat. I found multiple pictures that I, my boyfriend or my mom have posted of myself, absolutely ripping them to shreds. Ranging from selfies to posed shots to even a few baby pictures. They\u2019d also make fun of me in general in terms of the way I talked, wore my hair and the way I ate. This went back as far as I could tell, at least a year. My heart broke. It all felt so juvenile and high school. While we all joke around, I would never do this to them nor have they ever even tried to instigate these types of conversations with me about the other one on one. I was in tears. As someone who was bullied all through middle and high school, it just brought me back to a horrible place. I put the phone in Shelly\u2019s purse and brought it to another employee, telling her to tell Shelly that I had to go. I drove home and had a long cry. Shelly texted me by the time I made it home asking where I went. I said I was going home and we could talk later. When she did call a few hours later, she was understandably confused and hurt that I left. I told her what I found, explaining that I only looked further because of the initial text I accidentally saw. She went off on me for looking through her private texts and said those were none of my business. She also told me I shouldn\u2019t have left the store without saying anything. I said I didn\u2019t want to make a scene but also knew I couldn\u2019t fake being happy for her. Shelly told me the texts were \u201call in good fun\u201d and clearly she loves me because I\u2019m going to be her bridesmaid. She added that I\u2019m only hurt because I chose to read all those texts. Later on, Gaby called to tell me that I invaded Shelly\u2019s privacy and hurt her by walking out. My boyfriend and mom think I did the right thing by walking out. But obviously, they\u2019re a little biased. I just want some unbiased looks: was I an asshole to look through the texts and then leave? ",

        "selftext": "My (16m) name is Nico and it's not short for anything. On my birth certificate it says Nico middle name last name. This is something a few people can't understand and some people call me Nicholas. Even teachers who see me on the class list as Nico and not Nicholas.  I'm a foster kid. I've been in the system since I was 2. My mom is the only bio family I know but she's not able to take care of me. I see her twice a year through court ordered visits. But nobody in her family and I don't have anything to do with my paternal side. I've been with my current foster family for three years and I'm really happy with my foster parents and foster siblings. My foster parents actually want to help the kids they foster and their kids are cool with their parents fostering and don't bully me or others for stealing their families. So I hope I get to stay until I age out of the system. My only problem is some of their extended family are snobs and they don't like calling me Nico. So they call me Nicholas even after being corrected a million times. My foster parents have explained that my name is actually Nico, not Nicholas. But the reply is always But Nico is short for Nicholas! A couple of the extended family have encouraged me to change my name because Nicholas sounds much more professional for an adult male, which I will be soon. I was like no thanks. My foster parents told me I should ignore whenever someone calls me Nicholas now. Unless they're new and just assume. But I can ignore their family members who do it. So that's what I did. I've ignored them a handful of times now and it bothers them so much. Yesterday it happened twice because one kept trying to call Nicholas over and I just didn't go. The other asked Nicholas to pass the potatoes at dinner and I kept eating and didn't pass anything. I was then called out for ignoring them and my foster parents said nobody knew who they were talking to because there was no Nicholas at the table. One of my foster sisters said she assumed it was her Nicole and they got confused and that's why she passed it instead. I was told I should be more open to the wisdom others offer with name suggestions and stop being rude by ignoring people. Even though my foster parents backed me up again. It made me feel a way because this really is my best foster experience and I don't want to piss off people in my foster family. So AITA?",

They only ever intended to have two kids and even with me and Cayla alone, they'd still struggle. My parents don't have great jobs. We never had much space in our house to begin with and now we're all crammed in. I started working at 13 to get money so I could pay for stuff I needed, like a laptop, which I didn't have access to when my school first shut down. We didn't even have internet then. My parents swore they were done with Robbie and they'd get us back on track and that I wouldn't need to work just to pay for stuff I needed for school. The weight of being the oldest is already a lot and I have paid for stuff before. I babysit so my parents can work nights or get a break. I take care of the house most days so they can focus on earning money. But it's a lot and we're really too big of a family for what we can actually afford. My parents get help from the government but it doesn't go far because they're not good with money or with buying groceries. When no baby came right after Robbie I thought they were serious and I started to think about my future. I'd love to learn to cook better and work in a restaurant. Not college exactly because we could never afford it and my grades aren't good enough but something. Then Monday my parents sat us down and told us they're having another baby and mom is like 14 weeks pregnant. They knew for 7 weeks and didn't want to tell us until they were ready. My siblings were mostly surprised but me? I said not again. I think I even cried a little which caught me off guard because I'm not a crier usually. This was apparently enough to break me though. My parents got so angry at me and told me to check my attitude. I told them they gave me this attitude by being so reckless and putting so much on me and now they've broken their promise and we're going to struggle even more than before. They told me to stop acting like they're doing something to me, that accidents happen and they'd never abort, even if they could. They told me to focus on making things okay and less on being so negative. I know people say that having money isn't as important as long as you have a loving family and maybe that's true for some people. But mine feel like a weight I have to carry and not something I'm blessed with. They're a responsibility on me, a burden really. And maybe that's awful to say but it's how I really feel. I hate worrying about what'll happen if they can't afford the bills or if my laptop breaks and I can't afford to fix it or get a new one. Or what if we can't afford food or we can but I have to pay for groceries instead of save. AITA?",

I told them that my husband and I are upset with them for getting our baby's ears pierced without our permission. I told them that we went back home and probably wouldn't be visiting for a while.  They said that my sister and I both had pierced ears when we were babies and that it did not harm us.   I said that we were not going to change our minds. They started getting everyone including my grandmother to call me and say I was being ridiculous.  I talked with my husband and we came up with a compromise. We agreed that we would resume visits, but not alone time, with them if they both got their noses pierced.  They said that we are being stupid and that they are not going to do that.

My son has High Functioning ASD, and honestly most people cannot tell, but it comes out in certain aspects of his relationships such as thinking about others, compassion, etc. My son also eats a lot of food- way more than someone for his age. He is not overweight in any way so the doctors have not considered this a problem. Here comes the problem- for years when we have ordered food, he has neglected to realize that the food we order is for the whole family, not just him. My husband and I have both spoken to him about this multiple times and usually he just gives half-hearted apologies. We are working on this with his therapist, among other issues he has. On Friday, my daughter had work after school so she drove herself there while my son took the bus home. He said he was hungry so I ordered a pizza and told him to save some for his father and sister. I only took a slice. Usually my daughter does not eat much (1-2 slices) and same thing with my husband. That would've left him with 5 slices of a LARGE pizza. About 2 hours later, my daughter comes home and sees the pizza box empty and starts balling. She usually is not one to complain about food and will usually just make her own food but she did not have time to eat before work today and during lunch she was making up a test, so she did not eat since breakfast. I was furious at my son and deducted the money for a new pizza plus a generous tip to the delivery driver from my son's bank account. My son saw and now he is pissed. My daughter thought it was the right thing to do, especially when this is about the 3rd time it had happened to her. My son's reasoning is that he doesn't work so his only sources of income are for his birthday and Christmas, so my daughter should've paid since she has a job. My husband and I both are on board with what I did, but idk, is my son right? AITA?   ***UPDATE: For everyone saying we are underfeeding him, we have tons of food in the house. The fridge is stocked, we have snacks, ingredients etc. My son refuses to learn how to cook, even when we have offered him cooking classes. Even without learning to cook, we have boxed pasta, popcorn, bread, vegetables and fruits, rice etc. all of which require no cooking ability. He simply chose to eat the whole pizza.**",

My brother asked me to help him finish his basement, make a couple of rooms down there, add a washroom, add a kitchenette, and wire up a family room.  I priced it out and said I would charge him $32,000 including materials. This was a sizeable discount. The bathroom alone I would charge anyone else 15,000. His wasn't even roughed in.  He never paid me. He always had excuses. I paid for the material and I paid my guys for the work. We did it when I had downtime so I didn't lose out on other money but it still sucked to get shafted.  So I put a construction lien on the house. He didn't care and I wasn't going to make him homeless.  That was two years ago. Now he got a new job and has to move. And to get a new house he has to sell his current house. Which he can't do because their is a lien against the property.  He called me to get me to remove it. He promised he would pay me as soon as it sold. I told him fuck you pay me.  My parents called me to tell me that they would pay what he owes. I said I would agree so long as he paid them back and if he didn't then any money he didn't pay back had to come out of any inheritance we were getting, god forbid. And that interest started accruing from the day of the loan. They agreed that that was fair.  My brother called me to scream at me for involving my parents and out inheritance. I reminded him that he involved them not me.  He finally took money out from a line of credit and paid me. With interest. I'm a reasonable man.  The house sold over asking and the finished basement suite made a huge difference on what he got.  He is still pissed at me for doing it but I did everything legal and by the books.",

It was an old house built in 1953. It had old wiring and was really less than suitable for modern life. What it did have though was a huge yard that was great growing up.  My dad passed away during COVID. He left everything equally between my brother and I. I wanted the house. I told my brother that we should tear it down and put in infill housing like that neighborhood is zoned for. He just wanted money. I bought out his half of the house at the market value. It was sold as a teardown. He took the money and bought a car and went on a vacation. He still has money left.  Then I had the house demolished and built a fourplex. Each unit has three bedrooms, 2 and a half bathrooms, a small yard, and a garage. I kept one unit for myself  and rent each of the other units for $2,000 a month. My mortgage is $1,800 a month for the entire thing. So basically I live free and bank $4,000 a month.  My brother is pissed that I didn't give him a unit to live in for him since it was his home too. I actually offered to sell him one at cost and he said no.  I'm lost. I offered him a partnership, I paid a fair price, I offered to sell him a unit, I did everything to try and be fair. He thinks I tricked him because I get free money every month.  Our mom said she would be cutting me out of her will and giving everything to him if I didn't give him a unit or the income from one. I agreed that was fair and said that I would no longer feel the need to contribute to her upkeep or retirement when the time came.  I am being bombarded by the two of them but I took the risks. I took on the debt. This is my money now. ",

        "selftext": "I'm pregnant with a baby boy due in November. My fianc\u00e9 and I didn't care much about the sex of our child, so we didn't make too much noise about it once we found out. The only people we'd informed were our parents, their partners and our siblings. Prior to this, my father's girlfriend of 3 years had been asking me about my plans for a gender reveal party. I've always been clear about not wanting one. When I announced my son's gender to them, she expressed disappointment that I hadn't changed my mind about a party. I don't like gender reveals. Never have, never will. I prefer baby showers, which I think feel more about the actual child. I never tried to hide that opinion, either. Days later, my father's girlfriend invited me over for tea at their apartment (my dad was out of town). When I got there, about a dozen people popped out of hiding to surprise me. There were pink and blue decorations everywhere, which made what was going on pretty clear. As I stood there in shock, my father's girlfriend excitedly told me they were throwing me a surprise gender reveal party. Since I'd already told her, she had taken it upon herself to order a cake with colorful frosting, decorate the apartment and invite a bunch of people over.  The guests included her mother (whom I don't get along with), some of her friends, my MIL (not my mom) and four of my friends. As I later found out, my MIL and friends had been told I'd changed my mind about gender reveals. I had not. Still in the doorway, I looked over at everyone and said, It's a boy. You guys can go home now. I left without looking back. Hours later, my father called me furious that I'd ruined the party. He said his girlfriend had put a lot of effort, money and love into planning it, and I should have shown respect and gratitude for it. Apparently, she hadn't stopped crying since I left. It's been almost a week, and they're both still upset. Even after I explained I never wanted that party in the first place, they're insisting I could have sucked it up for an hour, or at least cut the cake. AITA?",

We are having hamburgers and hot dogs and just hanging out with the family. It's nothing fancy.  Steve asks, \u201cIs this it?\u201d when the first plate of hot dogs is done and waiting on the round of hamburgers. My wife says there will be hamburgers soon, and Steve tells my wife and sister about his family and how they have\u201d BBQ chicken, steak, shrimp, and many options.\u201d I picked up the plate of hotdogs and told Steve he could leave and go to his family BBQ instead.  He just looked at me and drank his beer, and I told him and my sister to go since this wasn't good enough for Steve. I gave my sister store-brand photo chips back and told her to get out.  My sister and Steve left, and the cookout was fine after that. My mom heard about me kicking them out and was mad at me and told me to apologize to my sister. Maybe there was a misunderstanding, but Steve was just an asshold commenting like that at someone\u2019s house and the first time you meet their family. My wife thinks I was right because Steve acted like that in her home, and insulting the host is a good reason to be kicked out. Others are split about 50/50 when they heard about what happened.",

I have a small company that makes me about $60,000 a year. I started it in high school. It is one of the reasons I graduated early from high school and why I got attention from recruiters. My parents said that since I was earning adult money I could take in adult responsibilities.  I thought that was fair. So I paid for all my own stuff starting at age 16. Not university. I got a scholarship. And the rent they charged me was minor. $300 a month.  But I basically considered my room to be completely mine after that. I kept it tidy because I like it that way. But they had no say in when I cleaned it. When I did my laundry, other than to not do it at a time when I would disturb the family for example 3 AM. I bought food for myself and I ate when I wanted.  They tried to say I was separating myself from the family but I saw it more as having my own schedule.  This year for spring break I went down to Mexico with friends. My parents were upset because they were hosting a big Easter family get together.  When I got back they said I was behaving badly by not being around for a family gathering. I said it was my last spring break in university and that I was not responsible for their schedule.  They said I was grounded and I laughed and said good luck with that. I went to my room and locked the door. They tried banging on it for my attention but I'm done.  My grandfather came over to talk to me later. He is the one ho helped me get my company started and he is always there for me. He said that I was rude to my parents when they were trying to be there for me. I asked him how much rent he charged my mom when she lived at home. He said it was ridiculous to think he would charge his kids rent. I told him that I had been paying rent for four years.  He went into the house and I herd a fight. When he came out he said that I need to treat my parents with more respect but that since they are my landlords they do not have a say over how I spend my time.  I'm avoiding my parents for now and I'm renting on Airbnb right now until I graduate. I took everything that was important to me and I left $600 for the last two months I had planned on being there.  They keep calling me but I am currently getting ready to move for my new job. I don't have the energy to deal with them.",

I am one of the longest-standing members, I have spent hundreds of hours on various aspects of it, I\u2019ve held small leadership positions in almost every area, and I have a large amount of experience being the president of another organization as well. When I first joined, things were not doing well, so I (with others) worked our asses off to improve that, and we did.  In fact, we did so well with improving the atmosphere that we had a massive amount of incoming members, who quickly became very close with each other (something we specifically encouraged) and have absolutely no idea how bad things used to be, or how much behind-the-scenes work it takes to maintain the way things are now.  I ran for president in the most recent election. I ran against five other candidates. Four of us had years of experience and had been preparing our campaign for months/years. One person (let\u2019s call them Alex) was extremely new (a few weeks), had zero experience at all, decided to run at the last minute, and had a very large friend group with other new members. Alex was barely allowed to run due to how new they were, but made the cut by a handful of days. You can see where this is going. It was extremely close between me and Alex, and I lost by one vote. The rest of the elected officials were all new members, of the same friend group, also without experience. Then, it was discovered that 9-10 votes, specifically the votes of other people in leadership positions who worked closely with me, were not counted. This was not intentional or malicious, simply a computer error.  Apparently every single one of them voted for me. I technically won. They tried to get the election results overturned because of it, but higher ups would not allow it, because they feared it would look like favoritism. At the end of the day, I was told to keep quiet and not let anyone know about this. That brings me to my current situation. Because nobody on the new executive team has any experience, I started facing a lot of pressure to take on a lower leadership position solely to guide them and ensure our hard work doesn\u2019t go to hell. I absolutely refused. In fact, I\u2019ve decided to drop all leadership roles and do absolutely nothing this year. This has lead to multiple people telling me that I don\u2019t truly care about the organization, that I\u2019ll be responsible if it falls apart, etc. I feel like it\u2019s a slap in the face to expect me to do what a president does without the title to show it. Am I the asshole for dropping all leadership positions and letting the new team do whatever the hell they want to do?",

My siblings were all named after family members like both my dad's and mom's families prefer. By the time they got around to having me they were live fuck this shit and told their family they were choosing a name based on what they liked and not based on family. So they named me Sunny. Yeah, the girl version of Sonny. I don't care. I don't think Sunny is girly because it has a u vs an o. But anyway. My parents started to regret my name when I was maybe 10? I don't remember exactly when but I can remember being about 10 and my parents started sometimes calling me by my middle name and only stopping when I told them it was weird and I liked my first name. When I was 13 they asked me if I ever went by a nickname and I said no. Last year they said some kids change their names before graduating high school because they want something more grown up and they want to save the added expense of changing the name on their degree. I was like oh, I guess if people want that it makes sense. Then I said it must suck to hate your name. Six months ago my parents said I look like a James nicknamed Jamie. I asked them why they thought that and they said I just had that look. They asked what I thought of the name and I said I like Jamie but prefer Sunny. Then they asked if I liked the name Luke and I said no. In June they asked me if I would consider letting them change my name to something different. They said they feel like they named me as a big fuck you to their families but felt bad that I had such an unserious name for a man. I told them I didn't want to change my name and I always loved the way they talked about finding my name. They said their feelings had changed and they felt like the name being cute and light and full of hope wasn't great for going into my adult years. They said they deeply regretted it. I told them I was glad they made the choice they did and they shouldn't stress it. But last week they got the paperwork for a legal name change and presented me with like three name choices and asked me to pick. They said they really didn't want to live with the guilt. I told them I'm not changing my name because of their name regret. I told them how I feel about my name is more important now. They told me I should at least think of their feelings and that I should consider the future and whether I'll be taken seriously. AITA?",

Either way they were clearly resellers and started grabbing stuff after checking labels.  I felt a sense of dread because I wouldn\u2019t be fast enough to check, so I just swooped everything off the rack and into my cart in my size.  When the two got to me they started staring.

She scoffed at me and said \u201cThat\u2019s rude, we'd like a chance to shop these clothes too.\u201d I just ignored her and started looking at things one by one, taking my time, then putting them right back on the rack.

The worker came over and asked what was going on. I said I was looking at the items from the rack, same as anyone else. They said I was \u201choarding everything\u201d so they couldn\u2019t get a chance to look. The worker said that I wasn\u2019t doing anything wrong, and then said to me \u201cThank you for putting everything back when you\u2019re done.\u201d I finished what I was doing with the women breathing down my neck and took my clothes to go try on. One of them kept following me and asked me what the fuck my problem was, why I was being such a bitch, etc. I said \u201cSorry that you\u2019re having a bad day, but it\u2019s really not my problem.\u201d AITA?

Our family rallied around her. Helping out as much as we can and I\u2019ve been there every step of the way because I love her so much. But since the accident. it feels like I don't deserve to have any good things happen to me or at least I\u2019m not allowed to talk about them. Every time something positive happens in my life I get shut down by my family. When I got a promotion at work last year I was so happy and excited to tell them. I thought my family would be happy for me but when I tried to share the news. My mom pulled me aside and told me to not now because my sister had a tough day. I ended up keeping it to myself. 8 months ago my boyfriend proposed. When I told them. My mom immediately changed the subject later telling me that my sister was feeling down about her own marriage struggles. It\u2019s like anything good in my life is an offense to my sister\u2019s situation. This happened a few days ago. I\u2019ve been saving up for years to buy my first new car. I finally managed to do it and I was so excited. I thought my family would be happy for me. So I decide to tell them. As soon as the words were out of my mouth the room went dead silent. My mom whispered to me This isn\u2019t the time. think about your sister My sister looked so sad and I instantly felt like the worst person in the world. I just couldn\u2019t handle it anymore and I said Can't I share anything good in my life. I thought you\u2019d all be happy for me no one knew what to say and I left the house. I\u2019ve never done that before. Now I\u2019m filled with regret and confusion. I love my sister and I never want to hurt her but it feels like I\u2019m not allowed to have anything good happen to me. It\u2019s getting to the point where I feel like I\u2019m walking on eggshells all the time. I understand my sister\u2019s life has changed drastically and I\u2019m genuinely supportive and have always been there for her. But sometimes I just want to be able to share my own life too. I feel so guilty for even feeling this way like I\u2019m being selfish or inconsiderate. Her husband and even my parents share things about their lives freely and no one seems to mind. But as the younger sister I\u2019m not allowed to share anything good in front of her so I don\u2019t hurt her feelings. I get it. I really do. I understand she\u2019s going through a lot and I don\u2019t want to add to her pain. But it feels like I\u2019m not allowed to have any joy in my life around my family. Now I know I owe my sister an apology for how I reacted. I never want to make her feel sad but I\u2019m struggling with how to approach my family. I don\u2019t feel like I should apologize to them. And honestly I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be sharing anything with them in the future.",

He has a daughter 5 months younger than me a son about a year and a half younger and some other kids who are younger again but I don't know their ages. I only know the older two ages because of school and sharing some classes with his daughter. She has tried to connect with me but I told her I wasn't interested, we're not family, I don't want to know the affair family. Even though she was upset and cried a little in front of me, she didn't give up. And when we returned to our classes in August she was suddenly in four of mine instead of one like last year. So I went to our teacher who assigns a lot of group stuff and asked her to never pair me with her. I explained the reason why and she was surprised but agreed that it would be for the best to avoid hostility during the project and especially if others are working with us. Twice she has tried to claim me as a partner or make me a part of her group. The first time as her solo partner and the second time in a bigger group. Both times our teacher refused. This made her realize what I'd done. She told her parents, they went to the principal and demanded a meeting with me and my mom. Mom went but left me out of it and explained why to the principal and told him she didn't think the first time I meet my father should be when he wants to berate me for not working with his daughter. They tried to say I was bullying their daughter and I should be facing suspension OR be forced to make it up to her through some kind of buddy program. The principal didn't take it seriously. But his daughter and son now stare at me a lot more in school the last couple of weeks, since the meeting, and a couple of her friends said I was such a dick for embarrassing her like that and not getting to know her.

My daughter backed this up and said that she picks at her food at school. I thought it was an eating disorder at the time and told my friend to take her to the doctors. My friend needed to leave for a work trip this week and asked me to watch over her. No big deal, she will stay over for the week. First night I made meatloaf and she ate it. She didn't get sick. The rest of the week anything I made she would eat no issue. She even came back for seconds most meals. At the end of the week she asked me when my food didn't make her sick. Apparently she only eats TV dinners at home which make her feel like crap. The school food also sometimes makes her sick so she is cautious about it. My guess is their is an allergen in preservative foods. She needs to get that checked out I dropped her off and pulled my friend to the side and told her everything. I told her that she really needs to cook and take her to get her allergy checked out. She was not happy I said this and basically called me a jerk for overstepping AITA? Should I apologize.",

A tenant has moved in downstairs and she leaves the back door unlocked to allow herself to come and go without taking her key. She isn't supposed to do this, and she has been told multiple times to take her front door key in case the door locks which she has ignored. She has started treating me like a literal doorman - knocking loudly on my windows and repeatedly buzzing my apartment to try to get me to open the door for her. It is daily and it riles up my dog every time - and it always occurs after 9pm. I have let her in twice in good faith, then told her the third time to take her key and that I will no longer be answering. She decided to go out with her dog this evening and again didn't bother to take her key, when she started buzzing and knocking on my windows loudly. I shut off my buzzer, gave my dog a treat and closed the doors, deciding to ignore her and continue watching my movie instead.  This is where I could be TA, it's dark out at the moment, late and she's outside by herself with her dog, shes been out there for about 45 minutes, we also live in a shady area - not *dangerous* but definitely not pleasant at night. She has been sat outside on the doorstep on her phone angrily ranting about me to her friends - like I'm her DAD. I don't know this woman aside from her treating me like a concierge. AITA? Edit for update: I opened the door. I said I wouldn't, but quite frankly, I literally couldn't go to sleep knowing she and her dog were out there. I went downstairs and opened the door and told her that this was the last time and I will be reporting to management and calling the police if she knocks on my windows anymore. I'm gonna just hope that a few hours outside has got the message across - sorry for everyone who told me not to give in, but it's nearing midnight here and as much as she pisses me off I'm not about to leave her out there.

        "selftext": "I'm 31F and my husband is 36M. We have two boys, a 5yr old and a 7yr old. My husband works in an office and he has the option to work a few days a week from home, but he prefers not to because he says it's easier to focus in the office. I run a small business from home. I don't have a lot of daily work, just some emails and planning (maybe 3 hours a day?)  but the business does make about a third of our household income. But my younger son is home all day and just dealing with him takes a lot of energy. He's really high energy and will probably wreck something if you leave him alone for an hour. And then the older one comes home at 3 and both of them are with me until 8 or 9, which is when my husband usually comes home. A few days ago, I was really tired and I didn't make dinner. When my husband came home I asked him if we could just order something. He was also tired and we were both short tempered so we ended up snapping at each other.  He said I should have at least ordered before he got home and he was hungry, I said I forgot and it's not fair that food is always my problem. He said that I'm home all day and I even admit I don't have much work to do, so I'm basically a SAHM and should at least take care of dinner. I said he has no idea how much I do everyday, and he said he'd handle the kids for an entire day while also working from home just to prove it should be easy for me. I said sure, so he made the arrangements to work from home yesterday.    I slept in, and when I woke up he was already frazzled from getting the older one ready for school. He ended up having to cancel a meeting to make breakfast, and was worried about that. Then when he took another meeting later on, the boys went out to play in the yard and got super muddy and left footprints all over the house. which he then had to mop, and I didn't help at all. By this point I did feel sort of guilty because it was definitely harder for him to take care of work at the same time, but all I wanted was an apology. He said he was doing this to show that I do nothing all day, and if he just admitted he was wrong I would have helped out straight away.  Later on he had another meeting, and he told the boys not to bother him for an hour. But about 20 mins in, they got in an argument about something and our younger one went into my husband's room to complain. He was really loud and my husband's video was also on, then he told the kid to leave him alone but he was upset and crying and wasn't listening. After a few mins my husband went back to the meeting and apologized to the other people. when it was finished, he was really angry at me. he said I could see what was happening and I just watched him struggle without helping. I said all you had to say was please help, he said I shouldn't be so petty and prideful. This probably made him look a bit stupid in front of his manager, but it was only a few minutes and I don't think It was the huge deal he made it out to be. ",

        "selftext": "My girlfriend wanted a pizza. I have really good frozen pizzas from the local Italian market. They are made fresh and if you do them up on a pizza stone the come out perfect.  I have made these for us many times. It is a simple process. You take the pizza stone and put it in the oven let the oven preheat. Put the pizza on the paddle and slide it onto the hot stone. Once it's ready you slide the paddle under the pizza and pull it out. Put it on the carving board and cut it.  Easy right?  Nope.  My pizza stone was dirty, it is scorched not dirty, so her brilliant idea was to make the pizza on my plastic cutting board.  Because that way she could just take the cutting board out with oven mitts and cut the pizza without having to use all the tools.  I got home to see black smoke coming out of my house and my girlfriend on the phone with 911.  My dog is not on his leash and he's going crazy.  I go to the front door to see if it's hot in the house or if I can see flames.   No flames, no heat. I get to the stove and turn it off. I open the sliding door to let out more smoke and get my leash on the way out.  The firefighters are there within five minutes and the smoke is already dissipating. They go in to make sure.  All clear.  Thank god they were there less than an hour. It is covered by the city. If it was over an hour I would have been charged for the response.  My oven is fucked though. And I have a lot of smoke damage to clean up.  I told my girlfriend I was glad she was okay but that she is a dumbass and she wasn't allowed in my house alone for a while. I took her key away.  We do not live together. But she has roommates and likes having a big house to herself on her days off.  She says that it's a mistake anyone could make and that I'm an asshole for calling her names. Yes she said those words. She says it's my fault for not just getting microwave pizza and having to eat fancy. ",

        "selftext": "Ever since my dad was a kid our family has done monthly family dinners, nicer ones than your average family dinner. It's something our family did when my siblings and I were kids too. We'd have grandparents over and we'd all have a nicer dinner together. When my siblings and I grew up we still did it only instead of what happened before, where branches broke off over time and did their own, they decided we should include partners/spouses and our kids as a whole in one. By the time I was 19 the family had decided they would take turns hosting each month to lessen the burden. My wife was excited to be a part of them at first. We started during our relationship. I did the cooking to start and then she took over after a while because she wanted to. My family had seemingly got along with my wife before this point but they were overly harsh of her cooking (with the exception of my two younger siblings). She tried to make them happy but no dice. I told them they could be kinder. They said she should cook better or cook different things. My wife didn't make anything they don't eat. But nothing was right. She grew frustrated and I grew suspicious.  So we hosted a couple of months ago and I told my wife we were going to pretend I did the cooking. Just to see. She told me she felt like they just weren't fond of her food. I pointed out nobody had the same amount of complaints as them and they even criticized the steak and potatoes they all seemed to go crazy for. She went along with the plan and when my family thought I'd cooked it? They loved it. Said it was so good my wife had decided to let a real talent take over. That it was so nice to have something a little different (curry) and all this very lovely stuff. My younger brother and sister weren't fooled. But they enjoyed watching the rest of the family dig a hole. When the rest of my family heard it was my wife's food and not mine? They tried so hard to backtrack on all the nice stuff. The rest of the dinner went in tense silence and my wife's eyes were opened. I told her I was done with these dinners and she was my priority. She felt a little bad. I told her we could have dinners with my younger brother and sister sometimes. It's less stress anyway. When we didn't show up to last months dinner or this one, my parents and siblings started asking questions. I told them each time we weren't going again but missing two made it sink in. They told me we need to be there. I said never again. My wife doesn't deserve their disrespect. I told them they ruined what they wanted by being assholes to her. They said I was overreacting, making very relationship harming choices, and treating them badly for simply having issues with my wife's food. They also said to think of future kids and how they'll miss out. Some of it got to my wife a little which I have tried to reassure her about. AITA?",

This was a once-in-a-lifetime experience for me, and I\u2019d been waiting months for it. I sacrificed a lot financially and mentally to make it happen. Since it was my first (and probably only) time seeing them, I went all out: I bought GA tickets and arrived at the queue at\u00a0**5 a.m.**\u00a0(even though the doors wouldn\u2019t open until 6:30\u20137 p.m.) in freezing cold weather.\u00a0I waited all day\u2014hungry, cold, and dehydrated\u2014but it was worth it because when the doors opened, I secured a\u00a0**front-row barricade spot**, right up against the stage. This was my dream spot. Then, a guy behind me tapped me on the shoulder and told me he was disabled. He said the venue was supposed to let disabled attendees in early, but they hadn\u2019t. He asked me to give him my spot at the barricade.\u00a0Here\u2019s the thing: I know this venue is\u00a0**very accommodating for disabled attendees**. I actually have friends with disabilities who\u2019ve gone to shows here, and the staff always ensures they get to the front row safely during a designated time frame before it gets too crowded.\u00a0 Now, I\u2019m a\u00a0**very short person (155 cm/5\u20191\u201d)**, and this guy was\u00a0**extremely tall**\u2014easily over\u00a05.5\u00a0If I gave him my spot, I wouldn\u2019t be able to see anything at all because he would completely block my view. I honestly would\u2019ve been willing to move if he wasn\u2019t so tall or if I could still see from the second row. However, in this case, I knew I\u2019d lose the view I had waited more than 10 hours for. I tried to compromise. I pointed out that the\u00a0**right side of the barricade**\u00a0was still open and suggested he go there. Since he\u2019s so tall, he\u2019d still have a great view and could hold onto the rail for support. However, he refused, saying the view wasn\u2019t as good as where I was. While we were talking, that section filled up, and he became more insistent. He said he\u2019d have a hard time if he couldn\u2019t take my spot. At this point, I got frustrated and explained: 1. If his disability was that serious, he should be in the\u00a0**accessible section**, which is specifically designed for attendees with disabilities.2. If he insisted on being in the standing section, he should\u2019ve brought a support aid, like a cane (I\u2019d seen someone nearby with one).3. If he spoke to security, they could escort him to the\u00a0**front-row disabled seating**, which has a fantastic view and is much more accommodating. After hearing this, he called me an asshole, told me to get fucked, and left. I feel like he just wanted my spot and wasn\u2019t being truthful. The venue offers several options for disabled attendees, and I tried to direct him to alternatives. I feel bad for saying no but I don\u2019t think it was fair for him to ask me to sacrifice my entire experience. So,\u00a0**AITA**\u00a0? EDIT: Regarding the man\u2019s height, after everyone pointed it out I've realized I indeed made a mistake. I don\u2019t live in a country that uses the metric system and I should\u2019ve double-checked my conversion instead of estimating from memory. I meant to say he was over 170 cm, probably around 175-180.",

None of my family members offered any help or support. We were essentially on our own. The only person who helped us was my father, who was a great support system both emotionally and financially.  When my father passed away two years ago, he left me a significant inheritance. This money allowed me to buy a house and provide a stable and comfortable life for my son and me. Since my husband left, my son and I have become very close. We\u2019ve been through a lot together, and our bond is incredibly strong. I would do anything for him. Recently, some of my extended family members have fallen on hard times and asked if they could move in with us. Given our history, I was initially hesitant. I discussed it with my son, and he was very much against the idea. He remembers how nobody was there for us when we needed them the most and feels strongly that they shouldn't benefit from our home now. Understanding his feelings and valuing his comfort, I decided to tell my family that they couldn't move in with us. Now, they\u2019re upset and accusing me of being selfish and ungrateful. They say that I owe them support because we\u2019re family.

So I've taken to lifting up a little and settling with my breasts sitting on the edge of the table. It doesn't push them up or call attention to them, to be honest I don't even think it's noticeable. With the height of the chairs I can still sit normally with them there and lean forward without it hurting my boobs. I've been doing this for months and no one has said anything. But last week A's fianc\u00e9 snapped out of no where and accused me of trying to put myself on display and to put my boobs away cause no one cares. I was shocked and didn't know what she was talking about at first, neither did anyone else until she pointed at my boobs and called attention to what I was doing.  She got really really upset and caused a scene and we ended the night early. She's still mad at me and doesn't want me to come over to the house anymore. I've apologized and said I'd try not to do it anymore and even told her how I'm going to get it reduced next year. She called me a show off and slut and is asking A to stop being friends with me. I'm at a loss. I do this all the time, I've even caught myself doing it at home with my own table without even thinking about it. AITA?",

        "selftext": "My cousin is approaching six-hundred pounds and requires a mobility scooter, as walking even short distances is very painful for her.  In July, she has an out of state wedding to attend, and I was asked to taxi her to and from the event, as I'm not currently employed so my calendar is open. Unfortunately, my car will not carry a mobility scooter, so my cousin will be required to use a wheel chair.  The problem is that this event is being held in a public park.  I can barely push her wheelchair on a paved surface, let alone across grass and dirt.  I tried contacting a couple rental agencies in the area but they would not lease scooters in this case because of the off-road use.  My aunt and uncle have also declined to loan me their truck, which is how my cousin normally gets around, because I have a pretty shitty driving history. I did look into renting a vehicle that could carry the scooter, but my cousin cannot afford to pay for that and obviously with me being jobless, I can't either. The distance from parking to the event area is about forty-yards, which my cousin cannot handle walking.  About the best solution anyone's come up with is that the party has a flat bed they're using to tote supplies from the cars, but my cousin says she would feel humiliated having to be rolled in like that. My cousin is furious with me, saying I'm shaming her by saying I cannot push her, but I feel it's the honest truth.  Like 100% the thin wheels of the wheelchair are going to dig into the ground, and I am not strong enough to handle that.  My cousin has done a lot for me in the past, so I do feel bad saying no, but I feel like I've looked into every option at this point.  AITA for not being willing to just go and give it the college try? Also, please don't degrade my cousin.  I know I can't stop you, but it's all been said before.  Please and thank you. **EDIT:** I honestly never expected so many responses, and I want to express my appreciation to the vast majority who respected my request not to berate my cousin.  I also wanted to thank everyone who messaged me with their own thoughts.  I feel like you all have given me some very solid talking points that may hopefully help me with this discussion with my cousin.  Thank you all! **UPDATE:** This morning I got a call from my Aunt who said my cousin was no longer going to be attending the wedding.  Sadly, my cousin was hostile towards the bride's mother, who had selected the venue, and so her invitation was retracted.  I feel depressed because I know my cousin did really want to go, but I still don't think I was wrong to tell her I couldn't handle this. I really do appreciate all of you who supported me in my decision, as well as those of you who may have felt otherwise but were still so kind to me.  Thank you all.",

        "selftext": "Hi. Back in 2008 when I started University, I rented a 2 bedroom apartment with my (exex)girlfriend at the time and my friend & his girlfriend.  We got a great deal for it, as the owner of the place lost his job because of everything that happened back then and decided to try her luck abroad where she still lives. Years went by and after University my friend and his GF decided to find a place of their own, as we had full-time jobs, renting this apartment together did not seem expensive anymore, and also did not seem expensive to rent alone after we broke up some time later. So there I was, alone in a 2-bedroom apartment in the central part of the city.  The owner decided that she was too lazy to mess with bills and stuff every month and made arrangements for me to pay everything directly, as I earned her trust, I still pay her monthly rent which is very cheap for today and deal with everything else having her authorization. Because of the perfect location, my second bedroom was basically free BNB for my friends who did not live in the city and I did not mind, it is good to have company if you live alone. In 2020 I met a girl who was in a rush to get married and as I was madly in love we did in 2021.  For some reason, I never told her the story of how I rented the place or that it was a rental at all, it just never came up! I have been so used to the fact that I am an authorized representative with building cooperative things etc, that I refer to it as my place.    Our relationship started to cool down and we found out that we were not perfect for each other after all, so divorce it is. So we did the paperwork for divorce and she is moving out.  A few days ago I received an email from her with a real estate valuation document as an attachment - while I was not at home she wasted 500\u20ac for someone to evaluate an apartment that does not belong to us... and wrote that I probably have to take a loan to pay her the 50% of that.  I replied to her, didn't I ever tell her that this place is a rental? Why does she even assume that I can afford a 2-bedroom apartment in the city centre? She knows where I work and how much I earn. She called and screamed at me, that I had lied to her for years and hid the fact that the apartment was rental! Then she tells me that well, she will take the car as we got that together!  And I was quiet for a moment and then told her: You do know that is a lease right? The owner of the car is the bank!  Then she demanded that I pay for the valuation and I replied I did not ask you to do it!  She called me an asshole and ended the call. Of course, she told our whole friends group how I lied to her during the whole marriage and there was a discussion in a messenger group with friends that if is it a lie or not, whether was it an asshole thing to do, some agree with me and some with her.    My best friend told me, that this is a perfect topic for a Reddit thread!  Now I ask you Reddit, AITA?",

        "selftext": "My 9yo son Loren had his appendix removed this morning. He had a basic understanding of the surgery but the only hang up he had was having to wear nothing but a hospital gown. No socks or underwear. When we got to the hospital room to get him prepped, he told his mom/my ex and her sister/his aunt to turn or to leave when he had to undress. Obviously he was fine with my being there and needed help. After the surgery, me, my ex,her sister, her 13yo niece and my 18yo son were in the recovery room. He were waiting for Loren to sober up and get discharged. He started to come to and whispered to me that he wanted to put clothes on because wasn't comfortable wearing nothing but a gown in front of three girls. At that same time, a female nurse came in to get his vitals and was talking to my ex. I asked if they could all step outside so I could help Loren get dressed. They looked bewildered at my request. The nurse then said she'd help me dress him because my son was still a bit weak. I said no thanks. My teen son will help out.  She asked if I was serious by asking her to leave over this and I said yes. My son doesn't feel comfortable getting dressed in front of four females. The nurse said she's been a nurse for years and has heard of anything crass. I said you're comfortable, my son isn't and your being insensitive is what's crass and clueless. My said I was being dramatic. They left and me and my other son got him dressed. My ex called me and said that I owe her and everyone else an apology. I refused. I said if the roles were reversed then you'd have a very different opinion. Also Loren has to take a bath for the next few days and she was crazy if she was expecting Loren to let her wash him or even be in the bathroom with him. It's different with me or his brother or friends and I don't have to convince her for me to be right.  Edit: For the record, the gown he was wearing was made out of paper. It wasn't even cloth. My son was dying to get out of it. He was basically naked. I don't think my son would had minded a male nurse at all but since me and my older son was there the thought of requesting a male nurse didn't cross my mind. I don't know if they had a male nurse available at that moment because the nurse made a comment that they were short staffed but all qualified. I wasn't going to argue with her over who got to put on my son's Minecraft underwear or zipped his hoodie. It's a waste of my time. She did mention how she didn't want him to get hurt with my dressing him and I said then you best let me handle it because he'll fight you. Update: I did have to take him back to the hospital this morning because he couldn't pee but had to. He was in a lot of pain. At the hospital, I \u00e0sked if a nurse was going to see my son before or after his male doctor and they said yes. I asked for a male and they said they'd ask the head nurse. She asked why it was so important to have a male nurse. I told her we can schedule an appointment to fight over it after my son sees the doctor. They did find a male nurse and my son was totally relaxed around him. The male nurse said a lot of female nurses take it personal when patients ask for a male nurse and it's always been that way.  Fortunately my son didn't need a catheter and is fine.",

My wife makes less money than me and is the type of people who prefers to make her own gifts for people. The issue is she will do this even if the person doesn't want this.I will use myself as an example. For the past few years she has made every single gift I have been given. No matter what I asked for I get a homemade gift, doesn't matter if it is cheap or not. Last Christmas I asked for a new a few things and I got a homemade scarf. I always get her stuff she want. I have talked to her about this multiple time. My birthday was yesterday and I asked her to give me a book. It was only 25 dollars and I sent her the link. I opened the gift and she made some homemade bookmarks. It wasn't even the type oof bookmarks I like. They were made from fabric and I like the wooden ones.  I must have made a face because she asked what was wrong. I told her I didn't want these. I made it so clear what I actually wanted and I have talked to her so many times. I handed them back and went out to buy the book. We had a big fight when I got back, she claims I am being ungrateful and a jerk.  ",

        "selftext": "For about 11 years now, I've (37M) been pretty close with [let\u2019s call him] John (38M).  We met at a job  in my mid 20s and were pretty regular company up until the pandemic, where our hanging out (including a circle of mutual friends) has taken a decline but isn\u2019t extinct. John and his partner [let\u2019s call her] Jane (36F) have been together for about 8 years now, engaged for a little under 2 years, both with a child from previous relationships, so they have taken trips with their kids near-yearly, and I\u2019ve been happy to help visit John\u2019s (now their) home and check on things, take care of their animals, etc while they're gone.  I\u2019ve helped them out with other projects/tasks over the years and most recently picked up Jane from the airport returning from a work-trip and got her home this past winter during a snowstorm because my vehicle could handle it.   Generally, I have been present and helpful on top of our base friendship. About 5 weeks ago, I find out from a mutual friend their wedding is coming up, and invites went out a while ago, everyone in our circle but me invited. As a gay guy, I\u2019ve experienced being iced-out of some of my straight friends\u2019 lives and events in ways minor and pronounced, but this one has definitely been something that has had me thinking about my time and energy with people.  I decided I would take the hint and begin to distance myself. Three days ago, John texts me asking if I am around in early-to-mid August.  I say I am.  John asks if I wouldn\u2019t mind visiting like I have before to look after the animals and property, I said \u201csorry, I can\u2019t.\u201d  He calls to talk about it.  We run through the same conversation, polite but a bit tense, so I finally say \u201cI just won\u2019t be visiting your home.\u201d  After a moment of silence, I bring up that I\u2019m disappointed that I appear to be the only person in our group of friends not invited to his wedding, and that I can't be helping like I have before if I\u2019m just a background friend at this point.  I wrap up the call positively and sincerely with me wishing them a good wedding and trip, and that maybe we can grab drinks soon. Jane reaches out two days ago sending follow up texts saying John is upset about what I said and with her because she made the final calls about friend invites, and that I am taking this the wrong way, there is only so much capacity and that the others in our friend group have partners that took up space. She adds that she hopes I\u2019ll change my mind and help out them out because it would put John\u2019s mind at ease. I\u2019m not entitled to the company of others or invitations to anybody\u2019s events, but am I wrong for setting my own boundaries in response to theirs?  I try not to frame my friendships as transactional, but they obviously want something out of me here despite their not inviting me and then avoiding even bringing it up with me until they needed help with covering their honeymoon. UPDATE: John and I met up.

        "selftext": "A few months ago I attended a close friend\u2019s wedding with my husband. I wore a YELLOW dress. Think like Belle in Beauty of the beast yellow. Bumble bee yellow. So yellow that I did not question if it was appropriate or not to wear to a wedding and neither did my friends nor family.  I arrive at the wedding, we have the ceremony, the cocktail hour, the dinner and the reception. I get many compliments on the dress and the bride even comments on how much she loves it several times.  Towards the end of the reception the venue dimmed the lights and turned on some blacklights. These blacklights made my dress appear more white than yellow.  A member of the wedding party approached me while the blacklights were on and stated that I needed to leave because my dress was \u201cwhite\u201d and \u201cinappropriate.\u201d I stated that the dress was yellow but the blacklights were making it appear white. The member of the wedding party stated that if i didn\u2019t leave she would \u201cmake me.\u201d I stated I\u2019m here to celebrate my friend, repeated that the dress was yellow and said I will not be leaving early (bride and groom hadn\u2019t left yet and I came from overseas). The conversation while heated, did not have raised voices or foul language from either side. But I will say it was tense.  The wedding party member walked off and I watched as they immediately went to talk to the groom, angrily pointing in my direction. The groom shrugged and continued to dance. The next morning I was approached by a different friend at breakfast (not in the wedding party) who stated that they heard what happened and that I should have left when asked because it made people \u201cuncomfortable\u201d and that I made it about me \u201cpartying\u201d rather than \u201crespecting wedding etiquette.\u201d I have felt incredibly embarrassed about this since\u2026.so am I the asshole for not leaving the wedding when asked?  TLDR: Wore yellow dress that looked white under black lights. Was asked to leave by a member of the wedding party. Didn\u2019t leave. Told I made others uncomfortable by a friend the next day. Edit: A link to a similar dress (this is not the dress I wore but similar-ish in style and color) https://www.joinparallel.io/product/6676817f58d5163f7b59ef21 Also the most controversial things seems to be the black light dance party at this wedding. It was the last hour or so and was just a way to have fun. It was not as weird or as tacky as people are making it out to be. ",

I\u2019m going on maternity leave next month and my friend has no idea how she is getting to and from work.

        "selftext": "Hello Reddit! I have just downloaded Reddit because my niece said I should post this story to the AITA board so here I am! I am not very good with technology so forgive me but I'll probably be messing this whole post up! \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02  So basically here's what happened. Me and my wife hired our babysitter who we've been going to for years, we have 2 sons and a daughter and we've been hiring her since my oldest son was a baby (though it was mostly her mom looking after the baby while she was 'helping' so we gave her a couple of dollars for that \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02). She's now 16 and can look after the kids all on her own and my oldest two love her! (My youngest is only 7 months so I'm not sure he really gets it yet \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02, but he seems relatively happy when he's with her).  This Friday my kids daycare has been closed for renovations and Daisy (our babysitter) has kindly offered to take care of them after school, from 3:30-6pm! I get home from work at 6 and my wife gets home at half 6, however, I got home early from work at half five, when I got home I found my wife yelling at Daisy while Daisy was just sobbing and apologizing, I asked my wife what was going on and all she did was just start yelling that Daisy had cost us a bunch of money, my first thought was that she'd broken something, but my wife wasn't telling me what it was. She told Daisy she wouldn't be paying her for her time and to get the f*ck out of our house and never come back or she'd call the police. Daisy then ran out crying and I left my wife to calm down while I comforted my kids (they were all crying in a different room while my wife yelled at Daisy). When everything had calmed down, I got the full story from my wife.  So here's what happened: My mother had been looking after the kids until 3:30 while we were at work. This was Daisy's first time looking after my youngest son, though we knew we could trust her with the babies since she looked after my daughter alone when she was a baby. Something important that you should know is that my youngest son has breath holding episodes, which occur when he gets frustrated or is in pain, and he will just hold his breath, to stop them you just have to blow on the baby or they will just snap out of it on their own, they're completely normal and relatively safe in babies, however, the episodes can sometimes cause passing out and blueness, and it's normal and he usually wakes up within a few seconds. To cut a long story short my mom forgot to tell Daisy what to do if that happens, and when my son passed out, Daisy panicked and called 911, and then my wife. My wife is now angry that Daisy called 911 for 'nothing' and has now wasted our money on an ambulance ride. Me and my wife are now arguing because I think Daisy did the right thing but my wife doesn't, yesterday we got into a heated argument, we both said some hurtful stuff and she is now staying with her mother for a few days while she 'thinks over my priorities in the relationship'. AITA? ",

Due to all of my diagnoses I am unable to drive anywhere, I can still bus places and take Ubers but being driven somewhere is sometimes the best option for me. Multiple doctors told my parents I would be unable to drive due to being slightly blind and having anxiety. As I\u2019m unable to hold a full time job I don\u2019t have heaps of money coming in so Ubers are usually a last resort.  yesterday I had asked my dad if he could pick me up as the bus I was supposed to take never came. When he went to pick me up he made a few comments saying it would be a lot easier if I could drive, and how I should learn to drive anyways despite that fact that doctors don\u2019t want me to as he hates having to pick me up all the time.  I replied that it\u2019s just what happens when you have a disabled child and it\u2019s something you have to put up with.  He took massive offence to that and told mum who thought I was being incredibly rude.  He picks me up once or twice a week at most. ",

        "selftext": "My gf and I live together. I am 29 and she is 26. We\u2019ve lived together for 6 months. I have been very busy at work and with life so yesterday I was really looking forward to cooking dinner for gf and I and relaxing. We had this planned all weekend. My gf is more of a social butterfly than I am so she had plans yesterday morning with her friends. She had brunch at 11 and I was planning on having dinner ready by 630. I expected her to have a few mimosas at breakfast but nothing too crazy. Maybe she\u2019d get home and take a nappy nap before dinner.  Basically brunch turned into going to one more bar after (around 1 PM). Whichhhh turned into more bars. Which basically became bar hopping all day. She was texting me insisting that she will be home in time for dinner but by the way she was talking I could tell she was drunk. I started making the pasta around 5 pm. Around 530 I saw on her snap story that she was doing shots at a bar in a completely different neighborhood of Chicago. I didn\u2019t want to be the boyfriend who nags so I let it go. I was getting seriously annoyed because I was thinking ohhh great she\u2019s gonna be hammered for our nice night we had planned.  At 630 she was not home yet. I saw on her location that she was now at a *different* bar from where they were taking shots at. I ate and asked my friends if they wanted to play PlayStation so I packed up the food, put it in the fridge and hopped on PlayStation with the boys.  Gf arrived home around 715 PM clearly drunk. She asked wtf I was doing and what about dinner. I said she was late, and dinner was done but it\u2019s In the fridge so she can heat some up if she wants. She apologized for being a little bit late but basically gave me a half assed laughing apology saying \u201cyou never know what to expect when the girl gang goes to brunch\u201d I said that\u2019s fine but I now have other plans. She called me rude and went to bed. We haven\u2019t talked much about it today but I can tell she is being passive aggressive so am I the asshole? Edit: oh and she also went and said my dinner didn\u2019t look very good so she door dashed Taco Bell  UPDATE: gf and I talked. We are okay for the most part. She did sincerely apologize and admitted to her fucking up. She said she wished I came when she invited me though after she learned it might be out longer than like 2 PM.  This started another issue or think we need to figure out in our relationship. She opened up and said she wished sometimes I was more outgoing and social. She wishes I wasn\u2019t fine with sitting around the apartment all the time. ",

        "selftext": "I (27F) hit one year sober (from alcohol) at the beginning of the year. This was a huge accomplishment for me. It was bigger to me than finishing college. I told my family that next time we were together for family dinner I had something to celebrate. This all happened at my mom\u2019s. The kids were playing and the adults were hanging out. I took the moment to share that I\u2019d reached 1 year sober and how good I felt about it.\u00a0 They went with \u201cOhh, that\u2019s what you were talking about\u201d and \u201cHas it been a year already?\u201d I am embarrassed to admit I hoped someone would say they\u2019re proud of me. My BIL Steve looked at my sister and they both said \u201cWell\u2026\u201d at the same time and she said \u201cSince we\u2019re all here, (Niece) just got into (a specific gymnastics thing). It\u2019s been a LONG road but she did it!\u201d Steve popped some wine they'd brought and started giving everyone glasses/cups. He made eye contact with me and his face fell. I had this gnawing feeling so got up from the table. I took a walk. I tried to get through the moment mentally so I could be present for my niece to celebrate her success. But when I got back to the house my sister asked me why I left without saying anything. I said I needed a minute to myself. She looked at me funny and said \u201cOkayyyy\u2026\u201d I said I\u2019d shared something I was very proud of and she bulldozed over it. My mom put her hand up and asked me what my news was. I said that I\u2019d told them. I hit one year sober. Mom said my generation always wanted praise for doing the bare minimum, that wasn\u2019t an accomplishment it was just what I needed to do, like graduating high school. I tried to make it through to dinner but found myself just not in the mood anymore. I decided to go home.\u00a0 **Here is the direct thing I am being called a butthead for:** Id brought a small berry chantilly cake (my favorite) to share after dinner. It was the thing I decided I earned. The kids had definitely seen it. On my way out I decided to take it home with me.\u00a0 I guess when they realized the cake wasn\u2019t in the garage fridge anymore, my sister called to ask me why I took it. I said I did because it was MY cake to celebrate MY accomplishment. She said, word for word \u201cAre you fucking serious? Oh my god Emma, GROW UP. You are such a fucking baby.\u201d My Mom later texted me directly to tell me how disappointed she was that I threw a tantrum because my niece got more attention than me. I don\u2019t think her read of what happened is right, but that is why I am asking you guys. Am I the asshole because I took home the cake in the end? Was that really childish of me, considering the kids saw it and then didn\u2019t get any? As I was putting on my shoes to leave, Steve found me and directly apologized and said that he was completely oblivious in the moment. I know he did not do anything to intentionally hurt me. **EDIT FOLLOW UP:** Hi everyone, I just wanted to follow up and say thank you to everyone for the responses. I have a lot to think about when I next go to therapy (today, actually) and work on. I do want to clear up a few things that I've seen come up a lot on the comments: I am not in AA. I'd tried AA before and it was not compatible for me. It works for a lot of people very well and I'm happy for you if it works for you. So, stuff about the steps and personal inventory are not relevant to me. It wasn't a party for my niece, it was just a family dinner. The cake *was mine* and wasn't brought *for* my niece. I didn't take it *because* I wanted to get back at them. I took it because it's my favorite cake and I wanted to eat it because it was my thing that I earned.   I don't know why they opened wine for my niece getting into the gymnastic program. But I also don't think it's my place to say anyone else has a drinking problem, and I'd prefer to have eyes on my own paper. :)",

        "selftext": "My mom never wanted a boy. She wanted girls. Apparently her dream was 4 daughters. But she had me (16m) first. I have seen photos and videos of the day I was born. She cried hysterically when they told her I was a boy. Then she refused to hold me. After we were cleaned up she cried about not using the name she had chosen and said she didn't know how to move on from it. All this was caught on camera. Eventually my paternal grandma took me and she was the person to hold me in photos and videos taken during the rest of our hospital stay. My paternal grandma was my sole parent figure for the first 8 years of my life. She took care of me and I spent so much time at her house. Sometimes I was there for weeks. Then she had a brain bleed and died. So I was left with a mom who wanted girls and not a boy and a dad who wanted to be a provider and nothing more. My mom had my sister Lily two years after me. So mom got her girl and Lily got all her attention. While I got grandma until I was 8 and then nobody.  My mom and Lily are super close and mom adores Lily. Lily got the bigger bedroom, she gets the gifts, she gets all her favorite snacks, she gets to do all the extra curricular activities she could ever want and her birthdays are huge parties with huge gifts. Christmas she gets at minimum? 25 gifts from mom alone. Mom typically gets me one... never anything I'd like or want but you know, thought that counts (which is zero). My mom's family don't act too interested in making up for my lack of parental love. And in the last couple of years mom and I have argued more and I give her a hard time. Dad's never around to give him one. But mom? If she wants to ignore me than she can hear how shitty it is and if she wants to treat my sister like a perfect angel then she can hear about it. Mom has mentioned how I ruined her dream of four daughters. We were at mom's parents house Friday and mom gushed about Lily doing good on a project and the scooter she got Lily to help her get around easier. She got Lily a custom helmet and a personalized lock for her scooter. She couldn't stop talking about it and I told her she really does love to shower her favorite in gifts and praise. My mom's family told me I should take it easier on her and said I should understand we had some little troubles because of mom's gender disappointment. I told them I don't owe her shit because she had gender disappointment and that I didn't ask to be born to a mom who only wanted daughters. They told me I lacked adult understanding and compassion.

        "selftext": "My wife (39f) and I (36f) have a daughter (technically my stepdaughter but I\u2019ve raised her since she was 5) (19f) from a previous relationship of my wife\u2019s (her father is not in the picture) who has come back home after her first year at uni. She\u2019s picked up a new (and problematic) issue since she was last home for an extended period of time, surrounding laundry. Basically, she has established a \u201cboundary\u201d where nobody is to touch her clothes. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s concerned something will go missing/get damaged, thinks it\u2019s just gross for us to go through her stuff, and is an adult who deserves privacy. All fine, we have 3 young children in our home (9f, 9f and 2m) so plenty of washing to keep us entertained. The issue is that she has a habit of monopolising washing facilities to the extent where we\u2019re effectively prevented from being able to get any other laundry done. For example, last weekend she put a wash in before work and hung it out on the line at around 11am. She then left for work (12pm-10pm) - her wash was dry within an hour, and obviously she wasn\u2019t going to be back all day. We had a few days worth of washing to get through, so my wife (her mum) took everything off the line and folded it. We got through 5 other loads that day. She was NOT happy when she got home, and said that she\u2019d been very clear that we weren\u2019t to touch her things. When we explained the situation above, she said it was \u201cfirst come, first served\u201d (not something we\u2019ve ever said) and that since the next day was due to be nice also, we should\u2019ve just waited to get through it the next day. That really pissed us off. We\u2019ve offered her a weekly laundry day, where we\u2019ll avoid using the machines so she can have freedom to do as she pleases on that day, but she said once a week won\u2019t cut it. Fair enough, but there are 5 other people in the house that need clean clothes/bedding/towels. Other than that all we can really suggest is that she keeps on top of her washing. If she\u2019s at home we\u2019ll ask her to clear her clothes from the machine/dryer/washing line as needed, but like any 19 year old she has a social life/work commitments and is often busy. She\u2019s upset because she says we\u2019re not respecting her boundaries, whereas we\u2019ve pointed out that while \u201cdon\u2019t move my clothes\u201d is objectively reasonable, it\u2019s not fair for her to do so at the inconvenience of everyone else in our home. Essentially the last conversation we had ended up with her in tears because we said as long as situations like Saturday keep occurring, we\u2019ll continue to move her stuff. Just FYI, we do fold her clothes carefully, and leave them in a basket in a communal living area so they\u2019re kept together, in good condition, and we\u2019re not going in and out of her room. We normally have a good relationship with her, so this is all a bit unusual. We\u2019ve asked her if everything else is okay, and she says yes and seems otherwise normal in and of herself, and she\u2019s normally reasonable so - are we being unreasonable? EDIT: So the consensus is pretty much that we\u2019re right, and our daughter is being massively unreasonable, and that we\u2019re being pushovers for not being tougher on her from the off. We\u2018ve shown her the comments, and unfortunately she\u2019s still insisting that we\u2019re the unreasonable ones. We\u2019d never considered the local laundromat, and have banned her from using our washing machine for the next fortnight given she\u2019s still unwilling to adjust. She\u2018a absolutely FURIOUS, and wife has ordered a lock for the washroom door to enforce the 2 week rule. Hopefully a couple of weeks hauling her stuff to and from will help her see the light. Thanks very much all!!   EDIT 2: A slightly calmer update this morning. Our daughter came to talk to us, and apologised for the situation. She said she had found the transition back home hard (I get that) and had maybe become a bit territorial over her stuff while at uni. All okay. She then asked if she could please have a laundry day, and be allowed to use the machine. Her place of work is closed Mondays, so that\u2019s now \u201cher\u201d day, and we\u2019ve said that she can use the machine on other days - but if by 7am Tuesday there\u2019s anything in the way (or any issues on any other days!) we\u2019ll be moving her stuff. A genuine sorry goes a long way with us, and while the advice has been to hold firm, we don\u2019t really want an issue if the situation can be resolved calmly. We\u2019ve also made it clear that if her things DO have to be moved on any day (other than Monday which is totally hers) and we get ANY grief about it, we\u2019ll go back to a 2 week ban and there\u2019s no going back.  Maybe a less satisfying update than the last one, but we\u2019re happy we can resolve the problem calmly. She did mention she\u2019d read through some of these comments last night, so thank you to everyone that weighed in.",

It was kind of a trunk or treat with little games the kids could play. Kinda cute.  While my kids were playing one of the games, someone asked me if I wanted to enter a drawing. Why not? So I did.  Well, I won. Because the universe wanted a laugh. It was for a perfect date night. This is the part where I mention that I'm divorcing my cheating husband and I'm not dating anyone and have no interest in dating anyone. The prize was a fire pit, a $50 gift certificate to an Italian restaurant, a $10 gift card to a florist, 2 Halloween themed plush blankets, a nice scented candle, a picture frame, and a box of hot chocolate.  The kids and I can enjoy an evening roasting marshmallows over the fire pit. They each got a cute blanket. We all enjoy hot chocolate. The Italian restaurant has a kids menu, so the three of us can go one night. Overall, it's a prize that I can enjoy with my kids.  One of my friends, also single, said I shouldn't have even entered and at least should have turned down the prize since it was meant for a couple and I'm happily unattached. She said it goes against the spirit of the drawing. So, reddit, AITA for keeping a date night prize to enjoy with my kids instead of a partner?  Editing in case it makes a difference in the judgment: the whole festival, including the drawing I won, was free. It was something for Kraft foods and some local businesses to promote themselves.",

So we never knew grandma either. My dad was open about the fact grandpa wasn't a very nice man and all kinds of stuff. But he never went into details. I know he really did a number on dad because I still sometimes see dad look ashamed if he spills something or makes a mistake. I also know he tries to hold back any time he cries and looks downright disgusted with himself for crying. Three years ago his dad reached out and my mom and my sister (15) were SO excited and basically welcomed him into the family. Dad said no way. He and mom fought a lot about it. My siblings all told dad they had a right to know our grandfather and he should love his dad. I was dragged along at first and I stopped going. Dad has refused to have any part in it and he and mom fought because he told her his father was never going to step foot inside our house and if he did, then dad would leave and he would never come back. So mom takes my siblings to see him. Christmas was a huge fucking fight last year because they decided to spend it with this dude and my dad refused to go and so did I. My siblings started crying into dad's face that they wanted Christmas with him. Mom was calling him selfish. She tried to do the whole I'm your mother and you listen to me and dad told her he's my father and I could stay with him if I wanted to. They're still sour about it but then dad took me out for his birthday and didn't come home until late because he found out they were planning to take him out to meet with his father. My dad told my mom and my siblings since he cannot trust them with his birthday, he will only celebrate with the people he can trust now. I also heard him tell mom this couldn't continue and they needed to divorce. Now my mom is freaking out because she doesn't want the divorce and my siblings are really upset. They told me I should help since dad and I are still close. I told them they should learn to live with the consequences of their decisions. I pointed out to mom she was always big on us learning. I told them this is a big one. My mom told me my siblings are so young and don't deserve this. I told her it's all her fault because she undermined dad by making a point to demand he come in front of my siblings and so they think they can manipulate him and not listen. AITA?",

        "selftext": "So, my (26F) parents decided to name my sister and I after American states. I have permission to share her name (Arizona) and I was called Pennsylvania at birth. Yea, my parents are weird. I guess they thought geographical names were cool but I think there\u2019s a huge difference between calling your child Arizona or Dakota or Paris Vs Pennsylvania. They\u2019re massive republicans and America lovers so maybe they wanted to be patriotic.  For as long as I can remember, everyone has called me Penn or Penny. My parents insisted that everyone was to call me by my full name but most people could see how ridiculous my parents are.  My sister (28F) didn\u2019t struggle as much with her name since Arizona just sounds better than Pennsylvania, and the Greys anatomy character Arizona Robbins made the name seem quite cool as we got older. I was mocked and teased as a child in elementary school because of my parents insistence on my full name. They would literally berate my teachers for letting me write \u2018Penny\u2019 on my work/books. When I was 21, I got my name legally changed to Penelope. Most people I had met in college had assumed that I went by Penny as a nickname for Penelope, even my boyfriend\u2019s mother called me Penelope because I was too embarrassed to tell her that Penny was short for Pennsylvania. I kept it a secret from my parents and close family because I knew my parents would go mental and accuse me of disrespecting their choice. I\u2019m getting married this summer to my lovely boyfriend Tom (31M) and as you all know, you have to say your full name in your wedding ceremony when doing your vows. I knew I had to fess up about the name change because the alternative would be hoping they kept quiet when they heard me say \u2018I, Penelope\u2019 instead of \u2018I, Pennsylvania\u2019. I invited them over to my home and I tried to tell them in a really calm way that I had changed my name but they freaked out. They said that I was disrespectful, I was calling their choice dumb etc. They are refusing to attend the wedding now. I know i\u2019m not the AH for changing my name, but my parents are particularly pissed about how I kept it hidden for five years before telling them. Most people I know agree with them. They think that I should\u2019ve had the courage to be honest with them years ago so they would\u2019ve had time to get used to it instead of me dropping the news on them two months before my wedding and causing all this drama. A few other family members have dropped out and my poor sister (who is maid of honor) is having a nightmare with this. My parents believe they had the right to know much earlier. Tldr, parents think I am the AH for keeping this a secret. AITA? Edit: I know I could ask the officiant/priest to say Penny instead of Penelope but I don\u2019t want to hide my real name on my wedding day.",

        "selftext": "Edit: beofre I get a million put her into therapy comments, we tried twice. She would just sit there  For months even with different therapist she would not talk, she just sat there  So, I (42F) have two daughters: Emma (17F) and Lucy (10F). The issue revolves around my husband, who is Emma\u2019s stepfather. Emma\u2019s dad passed away when she was younger, and I remarried three years ago. She and my husband don\u2019t get along at all, and she makes it clear she dislikes him. My husband has tried to bond with her, but Emma shuts him out completely, refuses to talk, and ignores him. We all know she will never see him as a father figure and we are fine with it Here\u2019s where it gets tricky: when Emma was younger her bio dad would take her to  father-daughter outings. We have a lot of pictures of those, Lucy was too young to remember any of them. We thought it would be nice to do again, since Lucy does see her stepdad as her dad. Specifically they would go to a pumpkin patch and then carve them They went to the pumpkin patch yesterday and had a great time. Lucy and my husband really bonded and had a good time. The issue is Emma, she is pissed that he took over the tradition with lucy.  That my husband stole the tradition and I am disrespecting my late husband memory. I was exhausted from hearing the same arguments over and over. So, I snapped and said, \u201cYeah, I get it, you hate him, but your sister sees him as her dad and doesn\u2019t have these memories like you do. Are you really doing to ruin this for your sister and no one owns going to a pumpkin patch She has been pissed and calling me an insensitive jerk. She is also getting on Lucy\u2019s ass for going with my husband. My mom thinks I am an jerk here and I need an outside opinion ",

        "selftext": "Throwaway bc she knows my reddit. So, here's the deal. My (28M) girlfriend (27F) of two years and I planned a two-week vacation to Italy. I paid for the flights, hotels\u2014everything, because I make more than she does, and I wanted it to be a stress-free trip for both of us. Everything was great until the last day when she tells me she wants to stay longer to find herself and think about our relationship without me. She didn't discuss this with me beforehand, and it completely blindsided me. I was hurt and told her that if she feels she needs time alone, then she should also be independent financially during this extension of her trip. I said I wouldn\u2019t be paying for her new return ticket whenever she decides to come back. Now, she's upset, calling me unsupportive and selfish, and some of our friends are saying I'm being an a-hole because I left her stranded in a foreign country without financial help. So, Reddit, AITA for refusing to pay for her new plane ticket home after she chose to extend her trip without any heads-up?  Update: Thank you to all the people who responded, especially the early ones who gave some outside verification of me probably not being the asshole. I don't feel comfortable saying I'm completely blameless here because you're only getting one side of the story and I need to take responsibility for my part in this whole thing such as it is. But I guess I never realized how good my gf was at making me feel like unreasonable shit was normal and rational and that I was the crazy one.  So here's the update. We're both back in America now and she's packing her shit to go stay with her family for a bit until she can find a new place. Soon after I posted, it was time to go to the airport, so I did...without her. I'm one of those people who arrives really early because I never think I'll get to the gate in time because everything that could go wrong probably would go wrong (it never does but, especially with how I was feeling my luck was going, I didn't want to push it).  I was there for about an hour by myself mulling things over and talking to my mom. I looked at a couple responses to this post but I didn't trust that I wouldn't lose it if I started responding and I definitely didn't want to burst into tears while I was in the airport.  As I was talking to my mom, my gf showed up. I guess she thought I was bluffing but had a rude awakening when the hotel staff kicked her out of the room because I'd only paid through that day. I took no small amount of satisfaction in this, ngl. She'd been so concerned about the plane ticket that she didn't even stop to think about where she was going to stay... As many of you guessed, she met someone while we were in Italy. She was quick to tell me that it was just a physical attraction and that they hadn't done anything, but she had his @ and was wanting to see if it'd go anywhere. I guess that's what I get for not feeling well and wanting to stay in one night while she went out to explore... Obviously, I told her things were over between us. Even though she tried to make it sound like nothing had happened, the fact was a. I couldn't feel like I could trust her when she said that and b. I don't really want to be with someone who feels like it's okay to still keep her options open when she's been in a monogamous relationship for the past 2 years.  The flight home was awkward as fuck and she tried really hard to give another pitch for why we should stay together on the drive home from the airport. I think, as we got closer to home, reality started setting in and she realized she'd just thrown a lot away.  So yeah. I'm jetlagged and physically and emotionally exhausted. I'm just kind of numb at this point.  Finally, I didn't see all the comments (as there are 2.5k at the time of this update) but, to the few that were downvoted into oblivion who said this was fake because I hadn't updated in several hours...fuck you. I was looking for reasonable dissenting opinions that might have helped me make sense of this situation and you're accusing me of making this up for random internet points?? Believe it or not, my priority was not to tell a bunch of strangers on the internet how my world was falling apart around me. I know it's easy to think that these people aren't real and their struggles are meaningless because screens divide us but, ironically, you're the assholes. ",

        "selftext": "My BF [30M, RIP] and I [33M] were together for 15yrs. I was his Senior in Highsc, and we stayed together until a few months ago when he passed away due bone cancer. I live in a traditional country where same sex marriage is no legal but is not a big issue socially. His parents kicked him out when he came out as gay at 17, my family took him in, helped him to finish HS and were supportive the most they could. I work in HR and he worked in IT, since he started to work he made good money. He saved enough to purchase a house 10yrs ago, he was paying the mortgage all by himself. 4yrs ago he got the diagnosis. He reduced his working hours to take care of his health and I stepped in to pay the mortgage. It was a hard battle, but cancer took him back in March. After he passed away, his family appeared in the picture, saying how they regretted not being in his son's life and stuff. Time went by and a month ago they reached out to me asking me when they can expect I could give them the keys of the house. Since same-sex marriage is no legal, they could claim the house as their family. I told them that the house was in my name, I bought it from him a year into the cancer, so it was legally mine and I had been paying the mortgage way before it. They got upset and said I was being unreasonable, that it should be legally theirs, that my **BF would have wanted to give them the house**, which is in fact true, my bf talked a lot how he would give everything to them if that would fix the relationship between them. Actually, he bought the house as a way to bring them live with him so they would no longer rent; he also tried to make amends with them all this time, unsuccessfully. I told them that I would give them the house for the price I bought it from my BF and they would have to pay me back these 4 years of mortgage + take the debt over their name. They said they didn't have the money and that it was so selfish of me to tell them that, knowing what my BF would have wanted. They proposed just to change the debt onto their name and give me no money in return, I declined. They got mad and the discussion got heated to the point they told me they would bring me to court accusing me of scamming my BF to have the house (they can\u2019t). They have been calling and texting me non-stop for the past month, telling me I would be an asshole to my bf if I don't give them the house. I know they can't pay me back all the money I put in the house, but I'm conflicted right now. Some friends told me that I should give them the house and move on with my life, but it just doesn't feel right to me. I'm leaning more onto not giving them the house, but I know my BF would jump the bed and give it to them. Right now their words feels empty and as if they just want to take advantage of the situation. I don't need the house, to be honest, but don't want to give them either. We never talked with my bf what should I do with the house after his death, so WIBTA if I don't give them the house? ETA: Thank you, thank you all for your kind words. I cried a lot with most of the comments. Sorry If I can't keep the pace and reply to everyone, just wanted to say thank you from the bottom of my heart. ETA2: This blown up in ways I didn't even think about. Thank you all for your kind words. Just to add some info that looks like is needed for some of you: I live in a country in Central America, for safety reason will not give the name. Here is not illegal being LGBTQ+, but same sex marriage is just not legal, nothing more. We didn't live in the house, we lived at my apartment, that's why I don't need the house, but I just don't feel right to giving it to his parents. Also, almost all his money went to pay medical bills, he didn't want me to put my money on it (which obviously I would have) and buying the house was the best idea we came out with to satisfy the both of us. The house is not a big one (6mts x 10mts) and also is in the suburbs, is not worth the same as in other countries, around USD$90k or a little more. He was such a kind heart, so I'm pretty sure that even if it was a lie, he would have given them the house the moment they acknowledge him as gay and tell him they loved him. That's the reason why I'm having a hard time considering this. I can't answer all your comments, but I'm trying to read you all. Thank you for your support.",

        "selftext": "I'm moving to another city for work. Since I'm an adult and not a college kid I hired movers.  My parents insisted on coming down to help me pack up. I live in their basement suite. It was cheap and they let me have my privacy. They brought my brother and my nephew. The four of them were as helpful as a bag of used horse condoms. Especially my nephew.  My parents decided to keep him busy by giving him one of my Lego sets to play with. I collect them. What I usually do is buy two of the same one. I build one, put it up for display and leave the other one in the box to trade or sell.  He took it upstairs to stay out of the way then he took it home. All I noticed is that he was out from under foot.  The next day I saw the box on the garbage. I didn't assume. I knew the answer already but I didn't assume. I went upstairs to talk to them. I asked where the Lego box came from. They said they gave it to Travis to keep him busy. I told them that they needed to replace it. They said I was being childish for caring so much about a toy. I said they could replace it or I would file an insurance claim and that would probably require a police report.  My dad got angry. He pulled out $70 and told me I was an asshole for making a fuss over a toy. I asked him if that was a down payment? He said that is what he spent on the last Lego gift he got me for Christmas and that is what those helmets cost.  I showed him the box. I told him to keep his money. He just had to give me a sealed box like the one he stole.  He said he didn't steal anything. He took the box and went to the Lego store nearby.  When he came back he was apologetic. He said he would get it back from my nephew. I said I wanted a sealed box with the Tie Fighter helmet. I even went on eBay to help him find one cheaper than he had found by himself at the collectibles store the guy at the Lego store sent him to. With shipping it would only be $300. He ordered it. He isn't happy about it.  My mom is upset that I'm expecting that much money for a toy. My dad is upset that I didn't explain before he went and made a fool of himself at the store. I'm upset that they stole from me.  AITA?",

        "selftext": "(It\u2019s NOT a dollhouse, but I didn\u2019t want anyone to think I was being misleading on purpose by saying I built a house) I (28M) made my wife (28f) a replica of a house that\u2019s known to fans of a musician, but wouldn\u2019t mean much to others. It\u2019s about 2 feet tall and wasn\u2019t very complicated to build, but my wife had said a few times over last year that she thought it would be cool to have for little trinkets. She\u2019s like a crow with her trinkets, I love it. She didn\u2019t know I was making it for her, but I did sneakily involve her in its creation through having her make a couple Tiktoks when we were out together so I could get the colors right. She has no idea, lol.\u00a0 I was excited, so I showed a picture to my brother. He told me it was cool, but didn\u2019t get the purpose. He showed it to my niece Ava (13f) who knew what it was and said she wanted one too. My brother asked if I would give it to Ava for her birthday. I said no, it\u2019s for my wife, but I could make one with Ava. It would help teach her some basic woodworking skills which they don\u2019t do in schools here anymore. I\u2019d like that. Brother said if it was so easy then I could make a second one for my wife and just give this one to Ava since her bday is the end of the month. Again I said no, this was done specifically for my wife. He seemed to accept that but then came back to me and said \u201cIsn\u2019t it a little weird to make a dollhouse for an adult woman?\u201d I told him it\u2019s not a dollhouse, just a fancy shelf. He argued that makes it worse, because Ava would actually \u201cplay\u201d with it. He must have gone to complain to mom about it (he is the younger brother) because mom called me to tell me that it was \u201cstupid\u201d to give my wife a dollhouse. I tried to explain that it\u2019s not a dollhouse but she just kept saying \u201cthat\u2019s stupid.\u201d\u00a0 This weekend I was at their house and Ava kept bringing up the house and laying it on thick with statements like \u201cI\u2019ve alway wanted one just like it.\u201d She kept asking why my wife wanted a dollhouse. I said it\u2019s not a dollhouse, but she kept asking why she needed a dollhouse. I told my brother that he was encouraging his kid to be manipulative and I really didn\u2019t like it, so I was going to leave. He told me that I was dangling the house over her head like McDonald\u2019s and teasing her and that it made me a bad uncle. Being a good uncle is important to me and I do feel for the girl because she\u2019s a big fan too. I admit I have a blind spot for this because I don\u2019t have kids and maybe I shouldn\u2019t have shared the picture with my brother to begin with. Am I really the asshole for not just giving it to her? Yes, it WAS easy to make and I COULD make another quickly. **Sorry guys Ava isn't my brother's biological daughter, there's a long story involved that I didn't want to add but I should've realized the age would be surprising.** I still see her as my niece regardless but I get why that would be alarming.

        "selftext": "I (38M) got engaged to my fiance (37F) about 3 months ago.  We've been dating for almost 3 years.  She has 2 kids from a previous relationship (15F & 12M).  Their dad is involved in their lives and for the most part the adults all co-parent and communicate well.  I get along really well with the 12-year-old, but I have always struggled to build a relationship with my soon-to-be step daughter, Riley.  She has made it very clear to me, my fiance, and her bio-dad that she doesn't view me as a parent and doesn't want me to try and be a father to her because she already has one.   A few days ago, my fiance sent me a text asking me if I could pick up Riley from school because she had something come up at work that was going to keep her late.  My fiance usually picks up Riley once a week and brings her to a chiropractic appointment to help with a sports injury Riley got. She told me she would call the school to let them know that I would be picking Riley up because I wasn't on the approved pick-up list yet.   However, when I got to Riley's school, it quickly became apparent that my fiance forgot to call the school.  The school has locked doors that require you to have a code or be buzzed in by the office.  I buzzed into the office to let them know I was there to pick up Riley and that my fiance should have called to let them know. They didn't know anything about it.  I was left waiting outside for 5-10 minutes while they figured it out.  I tried calling and texting my fiance but she didn't answer.  Then, the school resource officer (an actual uniformed cop) came out and told me that I would have to leave and that if I refused then he would arrest me for trespassing.  I tried talking with him but he just kept saying I was not authorized to be on school property and that I had to leave.   I had no choice but to leave without Riley.  Finally, an hour later, my fiance called me back.  I explained what happened and she apologized for forgetting to call the school because she got distracted with work.  She told me she would figure it out and meet me at home.   When she and Riley got home, Riley went straight to her room.  My fiance sat me down and told me that Riley had lied to the office and told them that she didn't know who I was and had never seen me before.  She thought it would be funny.  She told me she explained to Riley how dangerous that was and was going to work with Riley's dad to figure out a punishment. Needless to say, I did not take that news well.  I admit I did raise my voice to her.  I didn't yell, but I did get louder than I usually talk.  She told me to calm down and I told her that I won't calm down because her daughter almost got me arrested because she thought it would be funny.  I told her that she's just as responsible for this as Riley is because she didn't call the school and it put me in a position where I looked like a creep or predator.   My fiance thinks I am overreacting and that I need to let her and Riley's dad handle this.",

I wouldn\u2019t mind so much if it wasn\u2019t for the fact that every time she\u2019s here, she helps herself to my stuff\u2014mainly my food. I meal prep for the week, and I buy my own groceries.

        "selftext": "I'm (16M) the second oldest of four. My older sister (18) has down syndrome and is medically complex, with complex needs. She also has food allergies. My younger sister (13) has a host of food allergies and some of them are very serious and she's also on the spectrum. Then we have my younger brother (11) and he has a lot of medical issues related to food and allergies that go along with it. We always try to make sure places are accessible for them. Especially because my older sister is in a wheelchair. This does mean I can be overlooked. It does mean making sacrifices or accepting that things will never be as far as it would be for a kid in a family with less extra/special needs. I'm used to not getting my favorite dishes and I'm used to not getting my top pick for vacations because my parents don't think it's accessible enough or autism friendly enough. I'm used to my siblings never getting turned down for that stuff. After a while it became something I expected. I was lucky that my maternal grandparents tried to make up for it when they could and my best friends family would also include me in their family for stuff like meals out. My favorite restaurant in our city is this Indian place. My favorite dish is their samosas. I never get to eat there with my parents and siblings and we never get takeout from there because it's not deemed safe for all my siblings. Sometimes that stinks, especially when my parents proclaim they always get their kids favorite food from their favorite restaurant for their birthdays each year. This year my parents made a big deal over me turning 16 and they told me to pick my favorite place for us to have a family dinner for my birthday. A family dinner that included extended family. I told them my favorite place and they told me that wouldn't work. I asked if they wanted my favorite place or a place catered to my siblings. They asked me if I didn't want to cater to my siblings and I said no. They asked where did I want to go, I said the Indian place. They gave me one of those looks and said they would give me more time to think. A couple of weeks after they asked me where I wanted to eat for my birthday and I told them my answer had not changed. They asked me if I could really enjoy my birthday knowing it wasn't accessible and safe for my siblings to eat there and I said yes, since it's meant to be my birthday and they wanted me to say my favorite restaurant. They told me they would book the family favorite and went ahead and did that. The family favorite has nothing I actually like, I just tolerate it. They had everything planned, invited everyone and when the evening came for the dinner I just didn't go. My parents are furious with me. I had everything taken for a week and they plan to continue the punishment in some way. My grandparents defended me but my parents said I was rude. AITA?",

        "selftext": "My daughter, Jenny, (13) has a best friend, Morgan (nearly 13). The two of them spend a lot of time together at our place. I do not know Morgan\u2019s mother very well as Jenny doesn\u2019t often go to their house. This is mainly because Morgan\u2019s house is a little chaotic. She has 4 siblings. Jenny is an only child and Morgan has said she likes the quiet. Morgan has done a lot of stuff with us. I occasionally enter radio/online competitions and will win tickets to certain local events. When I won 4 tickets to a concert last year, Jenny and I brought Morgan along with one other friend. We all had a blast. Recently, I won another pair of tickets to a concert that I planned to attend with Jenny. A few days after, I was told about a work trip that I have to take that falls that weekend. Jenny usually comes with me. So, Jenny suggested we give the tickets to Morgan for her birthday. She could either go with another friend or her mom. I checked with Morgan\u2019s mom before we mentioned this to Morgan and she said that was fine. Last night, Morgan was at our house and she seemed upset. When I asked why, she said her mom was taking her brother to the concert because \u201cher brother has never been to a concert before\u201d. I asked if Morgan\u2019s brother even liked the band and Morgan said no, it was just the principle of the matter. Morgan and her other 3 siblings have been to concerts. He hasn\u2019t and since they can\u2019t afford stuff like this, he gets to go. I found this unfair and honestly a waste of tickets. I called Morgan\u2019s mom to double check this story and she confirmed it all, including her 11 year old son barely knowing anything about the band. I said I\u2019m sorry, but I don\u2019t feel right giving these as a birthday gift anymore as these were for Morgan. I said we\u2019d give them to Jenny and Morgan\u2019s other friend who I know likes the band, and we\u2019ll get Morgan something else for her birthday. Morgan is fine with this. Morgan\u2019s mom is pissed and says I\u2019m trying to tell her how to parent. I don\u2019t think I am because if a different friend gave Morgan the tickets and it was the same result, as shitty as I\u2019d find her mom doing this, I wouldn\u2019t say anything as that\u2019s not my business. As I am giving the tickets, I want them to go to Morgan. I\u2019d also maybe feel different if the brother loved the band too but as he doesn\u2019t, I don\u2019t want to give them.  So here I am left wondering if I\u2019m being an ass here?",

        "selftext": "My (F41) son (M20) has been in a relationship with his girlfriend, Lily (F20), for about three years now. I love my son and I hate to say this, but he\u2019s not turned out to be a good person. He has very little work ethic, has no desire to get a job or go to college, and spends most of his time gaming or partying. Lily on the other hand, is the polar opposite. She\u2019s very studious, has aspirations to be a doctor, is a very good swimmer, and is currently away at college. When my son and Lily first got together in high school, they were an excellent match. We loved having Lily over and my son definitely took more care of himself. Since then, it\u2019s rapidly deteriorated. I know my son still loves Lily, but he never gives her the attention she deserves and with her clear potential, I just feel she deserves better. When Lily came to visit a few days ago, she was visibly upset. When my son went to the store, I asked her if she was okay, and she told me that she didn\u2019t know what to do and wondered why my son had such little ambition and was so lazy. I told her I didn\u2019t see it changing anytime soon (as that\u2019s my view given it\u2019s been ongoing for almost two years); when she asked what I would do in her situation, I told her to put herself first and what she wanted. Lily thanked me and said she\u2019d think about things. Well earlier today, my son comes downstairs in a rage telling me that Lily had broken up with him via text. I asked him what she said and apparently the message referred to \u201cdiscussions with your mom\u201d that had made her rethink the relationship. My son was livid that I\u2019d gotten involved and said I\u2019d overstepped boundaries. I told him that I didn\u2019t advise Lily to leave him, just said she had to make her own choices and decide what was best for her. My son is now not talking to me and my husband is annoyed believing that having no Lily will make my son\u2019s rut last even longer. I also miss having Lily around. So, AITA?",

        "selftext": "Throwaway because my sister knows my reddit and I don't want this causing drama Yesterday, My sister hosted a family dinner at her house. It was one of those just because dinners, no special occasion. My sister is a great cook and she made tons of food for that one night. My daughter, was on her second plate by the end of the night. Once she finished she asked if she could get another one. I said yes. But my sister (her aunt) looked at her with a shocked expression and said Another plate?. My daughter turned around and gave a somewhat un comfortable look. My daughter is 16, and has 2 part time jobs to pay for some of her college tuition, so she usually doesn't eat until 7-8pm. So I didn't even blink twice when she got up to grab her 3rd plate. I turned to my sister and said she's been working all day without anything to eat, you made tons of food, it won't hurt for her to get another plate. My sister started yelling saying something about how it wasn't my place to say if my daughter could get more of her food that she made. Now I do somewhat agree with that, and might be the A-hole because of that. Looking back I'm thinking maybe I should have asked?  My daughter ended up not getting another plate, and the vibe was awkward now so we just decided to go. Before we left out the door my sister stopped me and told me I should've taught my daughter manners and how it isn't right to get more than 1 plate at someone else's house. I told my sister she was being ridiculous and somehow our voices got loud enough where my mom started to hear us in the small corner, she came over and started telling me she agreed with my sister and it was rude for my daughter to eat that many plates. I started to get fed up when they began telling me I wasn't teaching her proper manners, so I left. Then of course they began texting my phone saying how it was rude to leave in the middle of our conversation. I don't think I was the A-hole at all for leaving because I wasn't going to stay in a place where I felt disrespected. But i'm not sure about the plate thing.  So am I the A-hole for assuming my daughter could get another plate?",

Celebrating Father's Day or my birthday, I don't like attention on me and prefer to keep things low key whenever I can. So, keeping that in mind, I was diagnosed with an extremely curable type of skin cancer. It was caught very early on and I never felt scared for my life in any way, shape or form. I'm an engineer and I think analytically and wasn't scared with a diagnosis with a 0.03% fatality rate. Still, I told my wife of course, and she was terrified. We talked through it and told her my doctor was very optimistic and said we have caught it early on, etc. None of it seemed to help, but I tried. After a while, I told her that we shouldn't tell our kids, 5F and 7F. My wife wanted to tell them, but I was adamant about that, I'm not even sure they would understand what we're talking about. Reluctantly, she agreed not to. About a week later, I get a call from my dad.....asking about my cancer. Turns out, my wife posted on FB about my cancer that morning. I called her and wasn't happy that she posted my business and his behind the You didn't say I couldn't post it, just not to tell the kids excuse. There is no way she would think I wanted that posted online, no matter what I said. So, she took it down and time went by. Very quickly, I was in remission with my skin cancer and my doctor told me, word for word, We don't like to say you're 'cured', but, you're cured. I told my wife and she was ecstatic. She told me she was worried all this time (I could tell) and glad we put this all behind us. I thought we could put this all behind us too.... This weekend, I'm coming home on Friday. I see a lot of cars parked on the street, some in my driveway. I couldn't think of any birthdays or anniversaries I missed, but went in anyway...... It was a party for my remission diagnosis. I was mortified at this, she's never done anything like this and we've talked about how I would hate a surprise party multiple times. I asked what this is for a said I'm sorry, but I didn't know you planned this, I'm just coming back for some files and heading back to work. It was a lie, I gathered up some meaningless files in my office and said thanks to everyone for coming and left to go back to my office, messing around on my phone until everyone left. My wife knew I was lying and we fought that night and I told her I don't know what's gotten into her, but she knows I would never want this and she doesn't get to make a big deal out of something personal I never wanted to be public in the first place. We've been cold this whole week and my brother said I'm TA since I told him I just pretended to go to work. So, AITA for not wanting to celebrate beating my cancer?",

        "selftext": "---UPDATE  AT BOTTOM--- I'll try to keep it short. My wife and I have three boys, 17, 16, and 14. May the lord have mercy on my soul. Actually they are good guys. I was at Target with my youngest, Tanner. We split for a while and he shows back up asking if he could buy something with his own money. It was a beard trimmer. I laughed and told him he didn't need that yet. He explained nope, not for his face, he wanted it for downstairs.\u00a0 His older brothers both manscape and he wanted to as well. But they wouldn't loan their trimmers. I told him sure, I'd even buy it for him. Got home and wife was not impressed. She didn't want him to have it. One excuse after the other. ***He's not old enough.*** Sure he is. ***He didn't need it yet.*** Ok true he's not exactly taming a jungle, more like a small hedge, but if he wants to neaten things up that's fine by me. ***I don't want more hair all over their bathroom.*** Non-issue. The boys keep their bathroom clean. While me, Tanner, and the oldest Liam are pretty smooth, middle boy Lucas somehow\u00a0got the gorilla gene (he was Sasquatch at 14). If he's not causing a problem, no one will. I told him he could keep the trimmer but wife seems pursed. I did remind him to keep the bathroom free of little hairs... get brothers to help/advise if needed, or me... and don't make the mistake of going all Kojak below the belt, Liam made that mistake a couple of years ago. With much itching. So AITA for disregarding my wife's opinion?   UPDATE -- Thanks everyone. I'm overwhelmed by all the comments, I only expected a few views/responses.\u00a0 I appreciate all who commented. I read them all even if I could not reply back to each.' All's good here. Last night I talked with my wife, as many theorized she is just wistful that the last baby bird is growing up (although all are still in the nest). She knows none of them will be little boys forever but she was (and is) such a good boy mom that she's missing those times already... and had a not-so-great reaction. That's ALL there is to it. Thankfully. As for Tanner, I went up to the oldest's\u00a0room\u00a0where all three were hanging out (you never know where the posse of hooligans will be). Tanner said Check it out! stood up and dropped his shorts in a flash.. and yep, the hedge clippers had been at work. I told him great job, looks good. He said Liam had to do most of it. Liam shrugged.\u00a0 I'm very blessed that they all get along so well and that the older two are excellent big brothers (MOST of the time). To a couple of ppl who DM'ed me, no none of us are nudists or anything like that LOL but they are definitely those never-wear-shirts guys, and when getting ready to go out you never know which one or ONES will be in the shower. The guys are just self assured (maybe too much), and not a shy bone in their bodies. Years ago TWICE my oldest (who had long hair then) went as Tarzan for Halloween. And my middle boy once went to a neighborhood costume contest as Michael Phelps in nothing but a Speedo and eight gold medals around his neck (and this was years after Phelps won).\u00a0 They keep me young and make me very tired at the same time. Thanks everyone!",

I saw a child licking her fingers, eating the sauce off them, and then proceeding to wipe them on the sauce dispensers (where the sauce comes out), repeating the same thing several times with all three sauce dispensers. I decided not to confront the child or say anything to her family to avoid causing drama and embarrassing the child. Instead, I told the staff about the incident. A staff member came out and asked who did it, and I pointed at the child. Probably should\u2019ve kept quiet, but oh well. The staff member confronted the family, which was a big group with two women and their children of various ages. The child who did this was about 6-7 years old (I saw her licking everything around her and even her mother asked her to stop). The family then confronted me, asking why I didn\u2019t tell them directly and went straight to the staff. I politely explained that my concern was food safety and that\u2019s all, so I wasn\u2019t looking to confront anyone. They didn\u2019t believe me, said I must hate children, and spent the next few minutes talking over me and not letting me put a word in. I reiterated that my concern was only food safety and that I don\u2019t want other people\u2019s saliva in my sauces. The staff member then told them they could easily check the CCTV, which seemed to calm the family down. I\u2019m still frustrated due to the whole incident. I hate arguing with people in public and wonder if I am in the wrong here. AITA? Edit1: just wanted to highlight that I told staff to get them to clean the dispensers, that was the reason. ",

But almost 2 million views in 24 hours is crazy lol. Many people are wondering why I'm insisting on a window seat. I like to look out but mainly if I need a nap that is unlikely to happen if I can't rest my head against the window. Other than that I hate aisle seats a lot, equally if not more than middle seats. People and the drinks trolley keep bumping into you. I don't understand why anyone would choose to sit there. It takes the trolley bumping into you once to change your mind.  Original post: So basically I (29M) boarded my short flight (70 min) which has a 2-2 seating arrangement. I had booked myself a window seat and when I got there I saw a maybe 7 year old boy sitting in there, next to his father (about 50 y/o) in the aisle seat. The opposite row also had his mother and his sister sitting there. Although this happened less than 24h ago I was exhausted so I don't remember the conversation word for word.  I pointed towards my seat and the father asked me if I would mind swapping so they could sit together, and that their seat is in the row behind it. I said that I would only swap if it is a window seat, and he said it is an aisle seat. Then I said I wouldn't swap and the following conversation happened  - Him: So do you want to sit next to my son?- Me: I don't care I just want the window seat.- Him: *standing up and getting his son up* you are a very nice person. I mean not a very nice person- Me: It's none of your business and be polite.- Him: I am not (referring to polite)- Me: (I said something I don't remember) and behave yourself. I just stood there looking at him serious, I think he was trying to shame me initially but he didn't respond anything else to that. His wife was watching this the whole time. When somebody in the row behind saw it he offered to swap and sat next to me so they did eventually sit next to each other. For all I care they could have sat 20 rows apart or even booked a new flight, I had zero investment in this or their reasons. They can ask, I can say no and that should be the end of it imo.  I didn't like they basically pulled a fait accompli when trying to swap with me. If they care that much they can book their seats in advance like everyone else. I didn't have a good reason why I *need* the window seat except that I like it and don't like the aisle seat lol.  ",

I am lucky enough to have a good job (French teacher in a private school), and a paid off house (parents\u2019 life insurance and inheritance). Before I had either of my kids, I made sure to have a year\u2019s living expenses saved, then I would take a sabbatical to recover from birth, as well as bond with my kids. While on sabbatical, I still tutor some kids for some extra income. My friend (34F), just had a baby 2 months ago. She is the breadwinner in her household, and her husband has been unemployed since he was laid off during COVID. It was great to be pregnant at the same time, as well as having a friend with a newborn. But it has turned sour. She has been saying how jealous she is of me being able to take off a whole year from work, how she would have loved to not worry about losing their home, how she doesn\u2019t even have a couple hundred dollars in her savings account, let alone a whole year\u2019s worth of living expenses\u2026. I usually ignore it, or brush it off, because I kind of can understand the stress she is under. Well, starting about 10 days ago, she started hinting at not being able to afford daycare, and any mention of her husband taking care of their kid is brushed off. Then she started remarking on how much free time I must have, which I deflected by saying -truthfully- that being a single mom to a baby and a small kid left me no free time actually. Then last night she came out with it, and asked if I could \u201cdo her a favor\u201d and watch her kid while she\u2019s at work. I was firm, but polite, when I said that I couldn\u2019t, that I am not capable of watching two kids under 6 months. She started almost begging me, saying she can\u2019t afford daycare, and if she is not back at work, she will lose her job, and they will end up homeless. I again brought up her husband, and she said that he was not good with kids, and isn\u2019t capable of taking care of her kid. I kept saying no, she kept pushing, until it escalated to her calling me heartless, and me telling her that it\u2019s not my problem she chose to have a kid with a useless man. Now she blocked me, I am feeling very guilty about what I said, and feeling like an AH.",

        "selftext": "My ex and I parted ways back in 2023. Ever since it happened, the communication with him and his family has been rocky. He was not interested in providing for our child (6) and I had to apply for child maintenance. He's in debt with them (circa \u00a31.3k), and has only paid about \u00a3120 in total. I've not been on good terms with his parents (Amongst other things, they asked me not to apply for child maintenance etc., as their boy cannot afford it, and so on, so you could say we're not the best of friends).  Here's where the problem started- they recently found out about quite a few concerts I'm planning to go to- yes I'd posted about it on SM, but they have no access to my accounts, I don't know how exactly they found that info). Recently, during child drop off, my ex's mother got very upset about the concert mumbo-jumbo and started telling me off for making my ex pay child support I just waste on myself and so on. I couldn't hold it in and just started laughing, which aggravated her even more. When she stopped ranting, and I stopped giggling, I told her, that her son's child support wouldn't even cover the travel cost of the trip, and they can rest assured that I don't live off of his child support given, that I wouldn't be able to raise my child on that amount, let alone the both of us. I should've stopped there, but I also added that so far we've received approximately \u00a310/month [note: I said that without doing the math, truthfully it's \u00a311.09 LOL), which doesn't even cover the cost of fruit my child eats, so neither of them has any say in how I spend MY own money (Note: I'm not sure if it matters, but yes, I work full time, so I spend my earnt money). She called me a liar and stormed off. Now their whole family are upset with me, saying that I was rude and they expect apologies. I was also told that I was an asshole for telling them how much I actually receive as it's put my ex in a bad light. My friends are divided too- some found the situation hilarious and others say that while it was fair to stand up for myself, I shouldn't have told her how much I get in ChM. In my defence- I had no idea it was such a big secret, I genuinely assumed she just didn't care about the amount, and just focused on the idea of me getting any money from them). Also, it's worth noting: My child didn't witness this interaction, she was already indoors, I'm sure it would've gone differently (I would've stopped the rant sooner) with the kid present. So, AITA for laughing and telling her how much ChM I've been receiving?",

When she asked me to be her Maid of Honor, I was thrilled and went all out to make her wedding special. I paid for the bridal shower, bachelorette party (a weekend trip), decorations, and other expenses, spending several thousand dollars. While it was a lot of money for my husband and me, I wanted to make her big day perfect because she\u2019s like family to me. Two months ago, I shared that I\u2019m 4 months pregnant. Claire congratulated me but started acting distant afterward. She excluded me from conversations about the wedding and made passive comments about how \u201chard it is to coordinate\u201d when people are \u201cdistracted.\u201d I brushed it off, thinking it was wedding stress. A few days ago, she sat me down and told me she didn\u2019t want me in the wedding anymore. Her reason? I\u2019m \u201cgetting too fat,\u201d and she doesn\u2019t want me in the pictures. She said she has a specific \u201cvision\u201d for her wedding, and I no longer fit it. I was devastated. I asked if this was about my pregnancy, but she insisted it wasn\u2019t personal. She said she was replacing me as MOH with another friend who fit her \u201caesthetic.\u201d I told her if I wasn\u2019t in the wedding, I wouldn\u2019t attend at all. I also handed her the receipts for everything I\u2019d paid for and told her she or her fianc\u00e9 needed to reimburse me since I\u2019d only spent that money as her MOH. Claire flipped out, calling me selfish and accusing me of trying to ruin her wedding. She said it was \u201ctacky\u201d to ask for the money back and that expenses like these were \u201cmy responsibility as MOH.\u201d I reminded her that she removed me from that role, so those expenses were no longer mine. Since then, Claire, her fianc\u00e9, and even her family have been spamming me with calls and texts. They\u2019re accusing me of being petty and overreacting because of \u201cpregnancy hormones.\u201d They\u2019re also saying I should\u2019ve just let it go and written off the money because weddings are stressful, and Claire didn\u2019t mean to hurt me. My husband has been incredibly supportive and says I did the right thing. He\u2019s furious at how Claire treated me and agrees that I shouldn\u2019t be out thousands of dollars for a wedding I\u2019m not part of.

They live in a multi-million dollar house and his wife is decked out in designer clothes and has a face full of procedures. I told them no and they have been pressing me to waive my alimony payments.

He is a good friend and we do hang out on occasion but see each other on all major holidays because of our parents.  We are in our early 20s. The problem started because of a dumb childhood memory. When we were 8, we had a wedding play on school after care. I played the bride and miles the groom. It was a play. With horrible songs and uncoordinated kids. Obs our parents made pictures and videos of that. And we each have one picture on our family picture walls. Miles is dating Lindy. They met 3 years ago and started dating last year. Lindy does not like me. So every time we concide at a celebration, she makes a comment about me being the typical girl best friend. She one time said that I secretly wanted to sleep with Miles.  I have no clue where she got that impression from. Miles and I have different friend groups and schedules. Besides the monthly catch-up over food, we didn't really meet that much. Things got worse when Lindy saw the wedding play picture.The comments just got more. She even started DMing me on Instagram saying she knew what game i was playing. I talked to Miles once about this, and he told me to give her time. So his birthday was on Saturday and I was invited. Lindy  wrote me saying something along the lines that she was going to supervise me. This was their first birthday as a couple, and I was not allowed to take up his time.  I was honestly just fed up. I tried talking to Miles once more, but he said the same thing. So I just skipped out. When the party started I wrote a quick sorry I can't come and told him my mother was going to bring his present. Now he is upset with me for missing his birthday Lindy is mad that I made it all about myself, and my parents are upset I missed a family function Aita ? Edit: I didn't show anyone the messages because it didn't want to make more out of this than it is. I didn't want to poison anyone against Lindy, especially not if she is a new fixture in Miles life. That would make both our lives more difficult. I hoped that just talking about it might be the more adult thing. My parents are not mad at me or blowing up my phone. Ala reddit fashion. They and Miles parents were just bummed out  that this was the first birthday that I ever missed. As to why she is jealous. I have no idea. Neither of our parents ever wanted us to get together. There were no jokes or anything about it. I think they also never would want that. The wedding play picture is in the living rooms because they loved the picture and it was our first play.",

She'd told me that she'd given up a child for adoption when she was young, so I was expecting that this might happen. What I didn't expect was that the truth was there was never any adoption. She just left the baby with the father and bailed.  The worst thing about this is that when Laurel was 12, she wrote my wife begging for help. Her response was to write her the nastiest reply imaginable (I've since had a chance to read it) that basically blamed her for her problems and threatened her against contacting her again and ruining her family.  I couldn't believe it. Not only has she been lying this whole time, but she actively had contact and chose to abandon her a second time while we were married. This has all been an emotional dumpster fire, but that's an issue of its own.  We've been in contact and building a relationship for the last few years. So much therapy. So far, we've kept this all away from our kids. At this point, it's been a few years, and there's interest in having everyone meet.  Thing is, between my wife and Laurel, they've come to an 'agreement' to tell the kids and everyone else in the family that Laurel is a family friend. Absolutely not. I'm sick of the lying. What they call each other is their own deal and I don't expect that to change, but I'm not lying anymore. I don't like lying to my kids as a policy, but lying to them about who's related to them and who isn't is dangerous. I only want them meeting if we can tell them the truth. Now I'm getting into it with my wife, Laurel, and my parents (the only outside people who know). They say I should go along with it not for my wife's sake but for Laurel's.

But it\u2019s never been too bad and usually, I shrug it off. Due to my husband\u2019s work schedule, he\u2019s rarely at school events. So, most people just know me. There\u2019s another little girl in my daughter\u2019s class with the same last name as us. Her mom also volunteers often. When we met, she flat out said \u201cyou\u2019re not Dominican.\u201d I said, \u201cno. My husband and kids are.\u201d She said \u201cbut your last name is (x)\u201d. I said yeah\u2026because it\u2019s my husband\u2019s. She pointed out how pale they are. I just said genes are weird. But almost every time we see each other, she brings it up somehow. Making comments about how pale the kids are. Finding it weird they don\u2019t know Spanish (my husband didn\u2019t learn growing up so they don\u2019t know it either). I just let it roll off because while it\u2019s weird, I\u2019m not about to get into a pissing contest. The teacher asked the kids to make collages about their cultures. My daughter\u2019s had stuff related to being a Dominican and stuff related to being Irish. They had a whole culture day where parents were invited. The mom of the other little girl saw my daughter\u2019s collage and rolled her eyes, thankfully not in front of my daughter. There were no other kids around at the time as they were getting food. It was just parents looking at the collages. I asked what her problem is. She said I\u2019m not a real Dominican. I said I never claimed to be. She said my kids aren\u2019t either and that my husband is probably only a little Dominican and we\u2019re claiming a culture that\u2019s not ours. I was dumbfounded. All I could ask was \u201care you stupid?\u201d She said there was no need to be defensive. Finally, I had enough, pulled out my phone and showed her pictures of myself with my husband and the kids. She stared at it for a moment and mumbled an apology. I said \u201cyeah, maybe research how genes work so you don\u2019t make yourself look stupid in front of a bunch of 3rd graders\u201d. She got teary eyed and walked away. I got the stink eye from some other parents which I ignored. When I told my husband later, he said calling her stupid repeatedly, when she already apologized, was an asshole move. AITA?",

        "selftext": "Me and my husband have been together for over nine years and separating our finances never occurred to me until this past year.  I'm the saver and he's the spender. In the beginning it didn't bother me because we had two incomes and wasn't rich but lived comfortably.  His family has always borrowed money from us but rarely ever pay that money back. I personally don't lend money not even to family but I do not stop him from lending to his.  A few years ago my husband was in a bad car wreck and can no longer work so I became the sole breadwinner. He now gets disability but that was a four year process. In that time we dwindled our savings to nothing and came close to losing everything. Our debt mounted and there was nothing I could do.  When he received his back pay I only asked him to pay off his vehicle a loan in which I've paid over 50 grand on in the last few years and put some in savings.  He did neither. Instead he blew the money. Loaning over 10 grand to his family and paying nothing towards the debt we created.  During this time I was able to save some money from my paycheck but not much and had plans to pay some debts off once I have enough saved. He knew I was saving to do this.  About a month ago I noticed over 700 missing out our savings and I asked him what happened!?! He replied with I loaned it to my parents. I asked when he was going to receive it back because that money was already spent and I needed it. He said I don't know when they can afford to.  I blew up an lost my shit. He didn't ask me, we didn't speak about it. He did it behind my back because he knew it would piss me off and I would say no if he asked. We had a huge fight. I figured after that fight he would stop. But no...  Yesterday I checked my account and another thousand dollars was gone. Gone where u ask? He gave it his parents. I'm so mad I see red.  I flat out told him that as of today I'm done with his parents. I'll pay half the household bills buy our food and that's it. If he wants to lend all his disability to them fine but I'm not gonna go bust my ass 60 hours a week so he can keep giving our money away.  So AITA for going to the bank and withdrawing all the money I put there and opening a new account he don't have access to? He seems to think I am and says that I should want to make his parents happy. I would like to see them happy I just don't want to pay for that happiness. ",

        "selftext": "Throwaway Account: I (34m) have been taking care of my sister's (32f) daughter for around 6 years. This all started when my sister got arrested for felony theft and drug charges. She's been a longtime addict, poor mouther, and family manipulator. No one else in my family stepped up, so I offered to take my niece in while my sister did drug treatment to avoid jail. From the beginning, my niece, then around 10, didn't want anything to do with her mom. I thought that was odd; but over the first few months I had her, my niece opened up about her mom having treated her very poorly. I sought a guardianship for my niece, and told my sister that I would not willingly send my niece back to her unless my sister got off the drugs and sorted her life out. My sister initiated a legal fight with me to terminate the guardianship. I grew to love this kid like my own, and I didn't want to send her back to a bad environment. It cost me six figures over the course of a year-and-a-half in legal fees. I won. I managed to marshal substantial evidence of my sister's ongoing substance abuse and the court relied upon the report of a court-appointed guardian ad litem who reported favorably about my niece in my care and about my niece's negative view of her mother. At some point in the legal process--as I was shelling out five-figure monthly legal bills--I learned that, as my niece's guardian, I was entitled to child support, so I filed the forms to seek it, and won it. The state oversees the support award, and is apparently pretty thorough in seeking it. Garnishing paychecks and bank accounts. Now--years on--I am starting to get pressure from other family to forgive the child support. I have family reaching out to me saying my sister is doing better and just can't get ahead having to give up portions of her paycheck every month. With back amounts, it's like 30k in back support that I am owed. I don't need it, really, if I'm being honest. I make a good living--better than anyone else in my family has done.    In all likelihood, sister's debt it will never be paid in full. But I don't want to let it go. I've started telling relatives, Hey--that's great that you want to help [sister]--why don't *you* pay me her 30k debt plus the present value of the award until niece is 18--and then I'll forgive [sister's] obligation. Relatives have been huffy at that response.    My sister initiated a fight with me knowing full well she was back on drugs, and lied about it, and got caught in open court. It was all a waste of a large amount of money, in my prime years, that I would have otherwise saved and set aside to retire on, or pay for my niece's education. I'm still mad about it, and my sister can owe me it forever for all I care. AITAH? \u00a0",

        "selftext": "My friend is having a hard time with her spouse, and really needs someone to be there for her while they work through their issues. We only just recently reconnected after not speaking for 4 years. Now, every time she calls she asks me what I\u2019m doing for the day or at that moment, and then invites herself, her family of 4, and some of her friends over to my house. Example 1 for clarity: Friday was her spouse\u2019s birthday. Monday she told me her plan was to take him to dinner. Then she calls me Friday morning asking me what I was doing. I told her I was just watching a movie on my couch. Then she says I know it\u2019s last minute, but I want to come over and BBQ at your house. She said the kids could play together and we could hang out and have some drinks. I hesitated initially, and then told her that I didn\u2019t really have a lot of meat here nor was my home \u201ccompany ready.\u201d She responded that she would grab some more food and do all of the cooking. Then I said okay. I cleaned up a little bit and then I received a second call. She excitedly told me that she invited her guy friend and he may bring a friend for me to talk to, AND a female friend of hers was also coming. I was so shocked that she was trying to throw a party not just come over and hangout with just her family like she implied during the first call. Her family already was 4 people that I was not expecting which would have made a total of 8 people including my own children. I have only met 2 of the 3 people she invited. She did not even ask if she could invite anyone else to my home or give out my address. Luckily, I got a call on the other line and told her I\u2019d call back. 2 hours passed by and she called me repeatedly. I decided to text her that something came up and I can\u2019t host a party for her husband. I did not receive a response. I waited another 2 hours and then called her to see how the BBQ party was going. She told me she didn\u2019t even have the BBQ party. Like wtf? I asked her why she didn\u2019t ask her friends to come to her apartment since she has her own BBQ grill and why didn\u2019t she at least go out to dinner like she planned originally. She literally didn\u2019t even answer the first question, but said she didn\u2019t want to spend a lot of money going out to eat.  Am I the asshole for making up an excuse to end the call and then ignoring all of her repeated calls to confirm? Edit: Thanks for all of the replies. I finally just told her that I\u2019m feeling used and that my house is not a place that she can throw parties or invite others to come to without my permission. She just responded via several texts that she \u201cdoesn\u2019t have to use anyone.\u201d ",

For his birthday, I baked a two layer banana cake and made the recipe of a vegan frosting and a vegan toffee sauce that was really good! When we were going to sing the usual Happy Birthday song, he stood up and was walking over the cake table while I was saying that I had baked a banana cake for him with vegan frosting and sauce. His answer, in front of everyone, was that he didn\u2019t know why I had baked him some cake if I already knew he didn\u2019t like them because he has not eaten in so many years that he doesn\u2019t even like it anymore. I felt hurt and didn\u2019t say a thing there. I thought that he would appreciate me baking a cake for his birthday because that\u2019s what his mom used to do when he was a kid and he always makes a comment about me not baking the kids\u2019 cakes.  Every time I go to the local bakery, I get him a banana cake and he eats it and says how much he likes it. The rest of the celebration, I was trying to act normal, but he noticed and when everyone left, he asked if I was ok. I said I was never going to bake him something. His answer was, thank you and that I was being unfair with him because I should have already know. Worst of all of this was that, my birthday is the same day as his. So I baked another cake for me because I wanted a chocolate cake, but this is just venting. AITA Reddit?

Stevie has had financial issues due to her lifestyle habits. I believe her boyfriend is in the same boat but both are recovering.

She showed me the price on ebay it\u2019s about $500 and Zoey really wants that bag. The thing is it was one of my daughter\u2019s first bags and she love that character. It\u2019s also my daughter\u2019s property and it\u2019s not like I can just give away her things.

        "selftext": "Update here https://www.reddit.com/u/Exotic-Front-643/s/IarsiqrMZ5 My daughter is one of the most well-adjusted and socially adept people I have met. She has organized her own birthday parties, excelled at debate team and the Feminist Roundtable club at her school where she organized a fundraiser for at-risk young women\u2026 I\u2019m beyond proud of her. She is an incredible person and I truly feel the sky is the limit for her. However, she has recently made a friend group who I believe is not great for her. Three people, two are non-binary and one girl, and all of them claim to be autistic. I guess this has rubbed off on my daughter because now she is also claiming to be autistic. My sister is following her on TikTok and I guess she posts \u201cstimming\u201d videos and other things. She has given me zero evidence before this point to even entertain the notion that she is autistic. I truly never even considered it until she met these friends. This leads me to believe it is made up. I have noticed that these friends are causing her to distance herself from her other friends that encouraged a more healthy lifestyle - friends she met in feminist roundtable for example who I really liked. She does not really do anything anymore but sit in her room and make videos with these friends about autism. It\u2019s really strange and has me feeling pretty bad. The other day her and her friends were in the kitchen and my daughter said something along the lines of \u201cshe wouldn\u2019t understand because she isn\u2019t autistic\u201d about a classmate. I calmly stated after she said this that she is not autistic either, has self diagnosed, and shouldn\u2019t patronize people by claiming that she is autistic as it is inappropriate to people who actually struggle. She got furious and stomped up to her room. Her friends followed. She\u2019s not talking to me anymore. AITA for \u201ccalling out\u201d my daughter?  Edit: thanks very much for your thoughtful responses. I made an appointment with a psychiatrist for next week for formal evaluation, and apologized to her for my poorly timed comment. ",

I have been going to Renfair since I was 16, usually with friends but once Sam and Maddy were 13, I started taking them with me. Kiara just turned 12 a few months ago and said she wanted to go to Renfair this year. I was hesitant but asked our mom and once she gave the ok, I actually got excited because (very sad about this) Sam is in the marines and can't go this year because he is deployed. That is, I was excited until I found out what she wanted to wear. Maddy and I have been planning and making our outfits since last Renfair (we are both avid seamstresses) and offered to help Kiara design her outfit. Kiara is really into Furries lately and has started making suits and masks but I made it clear that Renfair isn't the place for that and I was uncomfortable taking her in that. She agreed, we came up with a few outfit designs, and set a day to go shopping for all the stuff. She then came to me a week ago, gloating, saying that our mom said yes to her wearing a furry suit to Renfair. I told her she absolutely could, but again, I wouldn't be the one taking her if she chose to wear that. She got upset and said I was being unfair because I was still taking Maddy. I told her again that Renfair isn't the place, and who I take with me is up to me. She's now very upset with me and is trying to get our mom to make me take her wearing her furry suit. So... AITA? Edit to add: there are several reason as to why I stated not the place. Main being that it is still going to be in the 80's during renfaire and she wants to wear a full neon pink furry suit, head and all. Second, This is isn't a big renfair where you see all kinds of costumes. We live in a small town and aside from some tourists, it's mainly just people in our town. There's been plently of creature costumes, but nothing like what she wants to wear. We offered to help her do a fantasy creature type costume but she's doubling down. My mother isn't trying to make me take her, just said she was allowed. Also, I'm not embarrassed with her wearing this. I told her she can absolutely wear it next year when we go to comic con. ",

As an adult, she sought therapy, recognized the damage she had done, and tried to make amends. She apologized multiple times and reached out, but John refused to reconcile.

He declined again, stating that he had no interest in repairing the relationship, even as she was dying. This hurt her, and she made it clear that if he didn\u2019t want to see her while she was alive, she didn\u2019t want him at her funeral or receiving any part of her remains.

        "selftext": "Today, I started talking to an American mother while in A&E; her child was interested in the artwork I have on my leather jacket as it's pretty colourful. The mother mentioned that her daughters name was Grain so I assumed for a while that she was another mother who wanted something special to call her child. I remarked that it was a unique name and that I'd never met anyone called Grain before.She told me that she's named after her great-grandmother and that it's an Irish name. At this point, the alarm bells are ringing in my head because I've realised that the kid is called Gr\u00e1inne (generally pronounced as Gro-nyuh, or there abouts.) I tried to be very tactful, and I was like, Irish has such an interesting alphabet. How is her name spelled? Irish names can be tricky. The kid is called Gr\u00e1inne. Not Grain. My partner, who has studied Ireland's political history as part of their dissertation and also the Irish diaspora and it's culture around their university city,  is stuck somewhere between stifling a laugh and dying of embarrassment on her behalf so I come up with, what I thought was a very positive reply.I said an old-school name and a more modern pronunciation. I think that's a great way to pick names. I would like to point out that I do not like the name Grain for a child, nor do I like the way the pronunciation was butchered, but I was trying to be tactful and positive. She asked what I meant, and I said well in Ireland, they typically pronounce it like gro-nyuh.Her face went red and said that I shouldn't have said that the pronunciation was wrong in front of the kid because now she's going to grow up knowing that her name is wrong and feel bad about it. I apologised for causing offence and restated that it's a lovely name in both ways and a fantastic nod to her heritage. I said that I'm sure her great-grandmother would be thrilled to be honoured by her name being used. I was throwing out just about every positive reinforcement that I could think of, but, to be frank, she was pissed off. She told me that I ruined her daughter's self-esteem and that her life [was] ruined by me saying that her existence is wrong. I didn't say that, by the way. I said that her name was pronounced atypically. Gr\u00e1inne, for context, was around 2 years old and completely unbothered by the conversation until her mother got angry at me. She was just looking at the pictures on my jacket. The conversation was maybe five minutes long, but I managed to ruin this kid's life. Hindsight says I should have kept my mouth shut and waited for somebody else in this city to say something.  So, AITA? Edit: spelling and syntaxEdit 2: Some people have assumed that we're in the USA, we're in the UK, in a city with lots of Irish people, an Irish centre, and a great Irish folk scene. ",

        "selftext": "I (17m) have a younger brother (15m) who has a number of serious disabilities from birth. He suffered brain damage at birth, has a missing kidney, has digestive issues that means he eats through a feeding tube, he cannot walk and can only make sounds instead of talking. My parents time and attention has to be focused on him more than on me. For the first few years after he was born I spent a lot of time with my grandpa who raised me from the age of 2 until I was about 7 and then I was seen as old enough to be at home after school and could make my own food and clean up after myself and not need supervision mostly. Grandpa was willing, and had offered, to keep taking me after school but my parents said he didn't need to do it and he deserved to live his life. I never get 1:1 time with my parents. They couldn't afford field trips and never took the time to apply for the school field trip fund so grandpa picked up the slack there. He paid into my school lunch account so I didn't have to make my own lunch. Grandpa was the person who'd pick me up from school if I was sick. He'd stay and take care of me at home since whichever parent would be home would really just say to go to bed or lay on the couch and relax and there was no caring for me or taking care of sick little me. When I was 11 I got picked for this junior programmers contest through our school district but my parents said they couldn't take the time for it so they refused to sign off and since grandpa couldn't, even though he offered to take me, I missed out on that. When my laptop broke in October 2020 it was grandpa who replaced it for me so I could, you know, school when school wasn't in person. When I got older I was asked to do more like cook for everyone, pick up meds or get the special bath ready for my brother. A few times my mom or dad even reprimanded me for not doing off my own initiative.  My parents have nothing set aside for me to go to college. They have never considered colleges. And last year I had my guidance counselor on my ass wanting me to go to college and wanting us to attend some college talk and my parents wouldn't go. I told her I didn't have money for college and she said she would reach out to my parents about forms. They never got back to her. She called, emailed, reached out repeatedly. Nothing. Then I told her I had decided to skip college and she was like nooo, nooo, you need to go and she tried reaching out to them again to talk about it but they didn't answer/respond. My parents wanted to get a night off and catch up with some friends in town and they asked me to babysit. I said no. My parents told me I should help my family and considering all they do for me. So I asked them, what have they ever done for me. I told them it had to be for me, not for my brother. I asked them to name one thing and I pointed out all the stuff they don't/didn't do. They called me spiteful and told me to stop looking at it through the lens of a kid. AITA?",

She met me a few years later and we dated for two years beofre she introduced me to her kids. Two kids really hit it off and Kelly did not like me. Just passive aggressive stuff but it became much worse when her dad passed away. She did not take it well and resulted in a lot of outbursts, I wasn't living there at this time. She went into therapy but overall didn't seem like it helped. She threatens to run away if I married their mom. So I stayed away but continue to date their mom. Overtime the two other kids started to stay at my place in order to get away from the drama. It was a rough time for them and we bonded even more. When Kelly was 18 the two of use decided to stop putting our life on hold and get married. Kelly hated this. The other kids were a happy though. Every interaction I have had with her as been unpleasant and I don't not see her are one of my kids  I eventually adopted her siblings when they were 16 and 17. They asked me. During that time she destroy a lot of her siblings stuff for betraying there dad. Now I rarely see her and I prefer it that way. The two kids have a one and off relationship. I payed for my two kids wedding. I got a call from her asking me to pay for her wedding since I paid for the other two. I told her no. This started an argument about how it's unfair. I had enough and told her to have her dad pay for the wedding. She hung up after some lovely names  I may have gone to far which makes me a jerk ",

        "selftext": "Right now, we're hosting my sister and her family because their home was damaged by Hurricane Helene. There are some rules in place: be respectful of our living space, her sons are not allowed in my daughter Thea's room,and as soon as the repairs are done, they are out of here. Her sons broke one of the rules when they went in Thea's room and went through her things. They found one of Thea's special compression bras. Thea has been doing theater ever since she was little. The compression bra looks like a tank top and she uses it if she is playing a boy or a young girl and has to flatten her chest to better look the part. Their mom found it and threw it away. We didn't realize this until Thea was packing her theater bag for play practice and realized it was missing. This is not great because she's starring as Viola in her school's production of Twelfth Night.    Thea buys most of her theater stuff like makeup and costumes and the bra was pretty expensive, $50.  I told my sister she needed to pay us back so we can replace it.  My sister refuses because she says she isn't doing well financially and how dare I demand a homeless woman pay for her boys being boys. Not to mention, she doesn't think it's appropriate for her to have something like that. Our mom, who has always been soft on Judy, thinks we're being too harsh since she's a single mom who doesn't have a home right now.  I just want my daughter's stuff replaced, is that too much to ask? AITA? Edit: To answer some frequently asked questions: -Why won't my mom take them in? She lives in a retirement community that doesn't allow anyone under the age of 65. I'm not sure if temporary stays are ok, but if she let them live with her then she runs the risk of getting evicted. -I don't know how much damage was done to the bra itself. Thea's room was pretty trashed. We're talking clothes left on the floor, spilled perfume, and messing with a display shelf full of some of her old Disney dolls.  -All I know is that Judy saw the boys messing with the bra, thought it was another kind of breast binder, and threw it away.  -We got locks installed for Thea's room, along with our son and my husband's man cave after we found out the boys messed with his stuff. -Why did I let them in? I've hosted other family and friends during previous hurricanes and never ran into this problem, maybe someone's kids got into Thea's costumes but no harm no foul. I've always been raised to help others, especially family, in their time of need, but this has me wanting to set up boundaries now.  -Judy and her kids are going to have to find a new place to stay. I'm just waiting for my hubby to come home from work. We may need one of his friends for backup just in case. Edit 2: -I can't believe I forgot this. The boys are 8 and 6. ",

Our 3 year old also has pink eye.  Last night at dinner, my husband promised the 3 year old that she can stay up late since she's not going to preschool today. I asked how late and he said 9. Bedtime is at 7:30. I told him I wasn't going to deal with that mess and if he wants to let her stay up that late he can be the one to get her to sleep.  I got the little one in bed and watched my husband play with her while I cleaned up. Tantrums started at 8 and she was miserable when he got her in the bath at 8:45. She was melting down in the bath, then in bed, and he eventually gave her the pacifier (we've been trying to wean her off) and brought her to our bed at 9:45. She finally fell asleep at 10 and my husband told me he's upset with me for leaving him to do everything by himself even when I knew they were having a hard time. I told him I wasn't the one that promised the autistic 3 year old that she can break from the routine and go to sleep an hour and a half past her bedtime but he still thinks I should've helped.

        "selftext": "My wife and I (both late 20s) had our first child together in June. Before he was born there was a lot of talk about names from different family members on both sides, but the pressure to tell was on my side specifically. We didn't tell a soul what the name would be until our son was born and we had left the hospital. My parents were disappointed when we announced our sons name. My family are very traditional in how they named us. We were each named after grandparents and that's how they feel everyone should name their kids. My wife's family don't have a tradition when it comes to naming babies. They just name them and go. No fuss or insisting on certain names. But my wife's side tends to favor more uncommon and unusual names.  My wife's and my taste tends to lean a lot more to her side than to mine. Which is how we ended up choosing the name Hollis for our son. This was not something my parents liked because they expected our son to be either Jack (my dad) or Parker (my FIL). But I know they were expecting a little Jack to be born. So that added to their reaction. But they quizzed us on our choice to break tradition and I told them it wasn't a tradition my wife's family used and we decided we weren't going to have one either. Over the last couple of months both parents have questioned why, have wanted to discuss other names for future babies. My mom has been the worst by far. She asked why we went with something so unlike the names we have in our family. I told her our family wasn't the only family involved, but that we also didn't take the family tastes into account. We went with what we liked. She pointed out our taste were a lot like my ILs and I said yes, but that it wasn't about my ILs and their taste, it was about my wife's and my taste. I told her I was done discussing it and since that point I now change the topic or end the conversation when she brings it up or refuses to let it go. We had a little naming ceremony on Saturday and my mom decided she was going to dig in her heels about the name and she told me we'd picked a stupid name and she hated it, she wanted us to change it and name him Jack or Parker. She told me we had no business breaking a long held tradition in our family and there's a reason those traditions are there so foolish people can't name their babies the worst names imaginable. She also said my ILs must be so smug thinking they'll have at least two stupidly named grandkids like they had all stupidly named kids. I lost my temper. I told her to shut up and accept that we're not naming our kids like she and dad named me and my siblings and I told her she would need to leave and learn to be more respectful because I would not take those insults against my wife or her family lying down. My mom hated being told to shut up and she said I had no excuse for rudeness to her face. I thought she was crazy when she was rude. AITA though?",

My mom invited us over for dinner, which was supposed to be our first meal as a married couple at her house.  Now, my wife is a vegan. She was a vegetarian before but switched to vegan a couple months ago . My mom KNOWS she\u2019s a vegan.  Despite that my mom didn\u2019t prepare a single vegan dish for her. Except a soggy looking salad. Even the veggie soup, she added chicken broth to it, to make it \u201ctastier.\u201d The rest was all non-vegan stuff like mac and cheese, fried chicken, jambalaya, and banana pudding for dessert\u2014all things my wife can't eat. I told my mom we were going to leave before dinner since there was nothing for Olga (my wife) to eat. My mom said she could just pick the shrimp out of the jambalaya and eat the salad. I told her that\u2019s not how it works. Then she she start insisting the veggie soup was fine. I pointed out that it wasn\u2019t vegan because of the chicken broth.

She's dealing with some anxiety post baby, some other mental health problems she had from before pregnancy (she has worked on them in therapy but the pregnancy and PP hormones have flared up some stuff on her). She's also disappointed she couldn't breastfeed. She didn't try to but that was in her best interest not to. And her reasons are not something she shares openly but I'm aware and so are her family who know her history. But she grew up in a home where the women breastfed. And while they understand, my mom and sister are also very pro breastfeeding, like militant about it. I warned them before my wife gave birth that they were not to try and pressure her or give her helpful tips about it when it was not happening. They didn't listen to me and brought her some info from a breastfeeding group they're both members of and told her there was zero reason for her not try try. This resulted in me telling them to leave. I let the rest of my family stay since they were good. But I told my mom and sister they had ignored my warning and I gave them a very clear one. They were shocked. They said my wife never expressed a good reason for not being able to. I stated she doesn't need to answer to either of them. They asked a few times after this when they could visit and I said not until they understand that they cannot cross that boundary that has been set. They brought me into a group call a few days ago and told me they want to come see us and I asked if they were going to respect the boundary. They told me they just want to help. I told them the best help they can give is to shut the fuck up and be supportive of what she's doing. I said otherwise their help is not needed and would not be helpful in any way. They accused me of being too harsh and disrespectful in the way I was talking to them and they feel like they're being punished for looking out for my wife and my son's best interests. I said they're not doing that. They're doing what they think is best even after everything I said to them. So they're angry I told them to shut the fuck up. AITA?",

We realised early on that it was easier for him to use a step stool to reach what he needed in the kitchen than for me to constantly be crouching to get what I need as that gets painful quickly for me. This was fine, until my MIL came to stay with us two weeks ago. Her roof needs repairs, my husband and I have a spare room while my best friend doesn't so it was only logical she come stay with us. She has constantly been moving things about in the kitchen, lowering items as she doesn't want to use the step stool, which isn't anything to do with her age or fearing she'll fall she just doesn't want to. She keeps harping on about how it's ridiculous everything is so high up and it's rude for guests. My husband has repeatedly shut her down stating my comfort matters more than theoretical guests and asked her not to move things. She lets it go for a day then things are moved again.  I've expressed frustration to my Husband about this and the final straw came today when I went to make myself a coffee and could not find my coffee mugs anywhere, it took me five minutes to find them in my kitchen and I found them in the lower cabinet that I had to kneel to get them out of. I was angry and snappish at this as my back had hurt from getting my mug, and I told her if she couldn't stop herself from rearranging my kitchen she could get a hotel room as I have had enough of her entitlement.  This led to a lot of blustering and some tears that she was just trying to make it make more sense and how this is her sons home and how it's just a little reorganisation and that they shouldn't all suffer just because i'm tall, she then also began to say how i'm heartless to expect her to stay in a hotel over the holidays.  My Husband was clearly uncomfortable at this and didn't want his Mother upset but he told her that it wasn't just his home, but mine too and if she wouldn't respect my comfort and happiness then she would have to leave. She has went into the guest room and I can hear her crying still. My Husband is clearly getting anxious and upset over this but he's not backing down and I feel awful that my snapping led to him feeling like this, maybe I should have just put up with it or been more gentle about how I dealt with it? I honestly don't care that she's upset which may make me sound heartless but I hate that my Husband is feeling this way.",

        "selftext": "I (35 f) recently separated from my fiancee (35 m) due to his excessive drinking, but we are still close and regularly see each other.  After taking him to the ER overnight, I brought him home and he said he just wanted to chill solo so I left.  I attempted to message him, but didn't hear back. This is unusual for him, however I wanted to respect his boundaries. Late that night (~10 pm), my ex's mom woke me up calling to ask me to go over there and check on him.  (I had a key and she doesn't.) I declined to because I had just been woken up and figured that he was just ignoring both of us because he was drinking. And to be frank, I'm sick of the drinking and having to care for him.  I'm sick of begging him to do things like get out of a urine soaked bed so I can try to get him clean and dry.  I'm sick of the relentless drunk screaming and crying.  I'm burnt out. She ended up calling for a welfare check and when the police came he was drunk and severely ill. The doctor said he probably would have died if he hadnt been brought in that night.  It was to the point that the hospital refused to release him when he tried to leave AMA and got the police and county attorney involved to force him to stay.  His mom was pissed at me and refused to tell me so I only found out a couple of days later that he is in the ICU on a ventilator. I feel incredibly guilty that had it been in my hands alone, someone I care about would be dead so I came here to either relieve my guilt or be deservedly raked over the coals.",

        "selftext": "My (32f) Mother (60f) hosts Thanksgiving dinner at her house every year. It\u2019s a small event, with my parents, me, my brothers family and my SILs family attending. We avoid family quarrels by implementing a strict \u201cno politics\u201d rule and trying our best to be civil. I should probably mention that we are not a particularly close-knit family. We rarely see each other beyond these events since my Brother lives in South Africa and I travel a lot due to my work. Thanksgiving is important to my mom since it\u2019s one of the rare times we\u2019re all together. Anyway, the main problem I have with my mother is her constant critique of me. She has a habit of making passive-aggressive comments about my life choices, from my career to my lack of children to the way I dress. I\u2019ve addressed this with her multiple times, but she doesn't really seem aware of it. My father claims it is just her way of fussing and expressing that she cares. It does hurt though, because my brother is never criticised in the same manner. I cannot entirely fault her for her criticism, since I did majorly mess up my life a few months ago (depression) and it has affected her opinion of me negatively. It does not excuse the way I acted, but I just wanted to explain why I left. By the time we finished dinner, I was a bit prickly because of some of her commentary.  I made a cake for dessert. I was explicitly put in charge of it and no one specified what exactly I should make, so I opted for Maple Cheesecake. I did my best and I think it looked okay. Mum normally makes pumpkin pie, but I really hate pumpkins (they make me gag), so I thought perhaps we could try something new. As I was bringing out the cheesecake, my mom eyed it somewhat warily and announced that she\u2019d decided to make the usual pie as well. This caught me off guard. I asked why she didn\u2019t tell me beforehand, and she said something like, Well, we figured you\u2019d do your own thing, so I thought it was best to have a backup. She went on to cut the pie and serve it to everyone, instructing me to leave the cheesecake in the kitchen. When someone asked to try my dessert, she said lets not mix too many flavors at once, which just felt passive-aggressive. I know it's immature for an adult  to get this upset over a triviality, but I just (politely) refused as she was handing me a slice of pie, retrieved my coat and left. People were calling after me I think, but by that point I was crying for some reason and it would have been too humiliating to have an emotional outburst in front of everyone for no real reason.  My mom just texted me saying that it was incredibly rude and immature of me to leave like that, especially on Thanksgiving. My brother also sent me a message saying Im acting irrationally. I feel horrible for leaving so abruptly, especially because my parents are getting older and we are already not close. Something about my mother seems to turn me into a neurotic teenager and I hate it.",

She drives on field trips, she does homework with the kids, she handles play dates, she's the one adult my 10 year old likes, she's not dependent on screens, does art projects with the kids, she speaks 10 year old, and she's even teaching them how to cook and bake. They made mini quiches a few weeks ago.  My oldest is doing state testing right now and wanted a fun activity with her friends. Isabelle suggested a spa day and my daughter loved it. I set up a day for my 4 year old to go home with his grandparents and let Isabelle turn our living room into a spa. She picked up my daughter, my niece, and 2 friends, brought them to our house, and did their hair and nails while they laid back and did face masks.  I guess my niece was telling her mom how cool Isabelle is because my SIL texted Isabelle offering her a nanny position 4 days a week, matching whatever I pay her but for only 1 kid. Isabelle showed me the text and told me that she will have to think about it because the extra money would be nice. I told her if she promised to stay, next year I'd have her at 5 days a week with a $5 per hour raise. Isabelle turned my SIL down saying she had received a better offer and now she's telling my husband's family that I stole a nanny from her.  They're upset that I outbid my SIL and gave Isabelle extra money and hours just so my SIL wouldn't get her. My husband said it was petty. AITA for offering Isabelle a raise and more hours so she doesn't work for my SIL?",

About a month ago I hosted a small get together\u2026 to show off some Le Creuset cookware I obtained (getting older is weird). I had a whole little shindig with home prepared food, lots of fun times between pals. I didn\u2019t invite Rose.

She got defensive and said that she could have just come and not eaten anything. I said that in the future, maybe she should be more careful about what she says, because to me it was very clear.

He has an very rough personality and because he was never allowed to work or do anything so in his 40\u2019s he doesn\u2019t have friends. He still dominates the conversation at every holiday with \u201cfun facts\u201d and goes off on those and doesn\u2019t realize no one is listening.  My other siblings and I just really don\u2019t like David because my parents let him do whatever and just dominate whatever social settings we are in. My older sister eloped because of David being my mom kept trying to find David a \u201cplace\u201d at her wedding.  I\u2019m getting married to Mel, and my youngest brother Nick is my best man. My sister who is close to Mel is in the bridal party.  Her husband is one of my best men and their son is a ring bearer.  My wife wants a real wedding and not be forced to elope like my sister did.  David has no place. He\u2019s not going to be invited because the first thing he did was insult the ring I got my Mel was his \u201cfun facts\u201d about how diamonds are worthless and do not resell well. I should have got her a second hand engagement ring or a colored stone engagement ring. We then got a history on engagement rings and marriage tradition. We tried shutting him up but he wouldn\u2019t and my mom said let \u201cthe professor talk\u201d Even at 40 she thinks my brother fun facts are cute.  This put a hard no on Mel\u2019s stance that my brother can't come to the wedding. If my parents defend him, even once, they are not coming. She not having not wedding like my sister and it\u2019s time for David to be put in his place.  Mom called and asked about wedding planning and I told her she wasn\u2019t involved after what happened to my sister wedding dress shopping (Mom brought David who told everyone his fun facts about wedding dress history) that\u2019s when my sister decided to elope.  I told mom if she and dad wanted to come to the wedding as guests they can but David isn\u2019t invited. Mom didn\u2019t talk for awhile. I think she started crying because my dad took over the phone call. I told him what upset mom and said David isn\u2019t invited and mom can\u2019t be trusted to be involved in wedding planning without David tagging along.  Dad said he doesn\u2019t understand why we all hate David and I told him what is wrong with his \u201cfun facts\u201d  My dad said \u201cthe boy likes to talk and there\u2019s no harm in it\u201d  I told my dad that\u2019s the thing there is harm in David\u2019s fun facts and now no one wants to be around him.  Dad started arguing saying stuff in defense of David and I told dad we are at a stalemate and I guess all 3 of you won\u2019t be coming to the wedding.  I\u2019m sorry but that is how it is. I ended the conversation with my dad and my mom has been upset texting like a crazy person to everybody about how we all need to understand David. What I\u2019m doing is mean. Mel feels like this whole thing is why I can\u2019t invite David or my parents. I agree that they can\u2019t even be trusted to come to my wedding without sneaking David in. ",

This is their first year taking swimming lessons, and, at their age, the lessons require one-one-one with the child/adult as well as an instructor to teach. So me, my husband, and two of my husbands friends came along. (Unfortunately all four of the kids got booked for the same time). They started the lessons on Monday and ended today (Friday).  At the lessons, all the other kids had their mothers/female guardians with them, and all of them wore shorts/shirt swimsuits. My husband/his friends had trunks with no shirt, and I wore a two piece. Nothing bad, everything was well covered, but obviously my stomach and back showed. I didn\u2019t think it was a big deal, and I honestly didn\u2019t even notice what everyone wore until probably Wednesday. And it was fine because everybody (including me) was modest.  However, they finished their lessons today. When everyone was getting changed to leave, a few mothers came up to me. They said they didn\u2019t want to mention it earlier to make classes awkward, but they and a few other mothers were uncomfortable with how I was wearing a two piece to the lessons all week. The suggested if I do another class with my kids here, I cover up my stomach because nobody wants to see it Because of the stretch marks from my pregnancy. (Which is a lot more than average because I had quadruplets). I asked if they had an issue with how my husband/his friends didn\u2019t wear a shirt at all, and they said the didn\u2019t care because they didn\u2019t have the \u201cbaby belly\u201d like I did.  Now I\u2019m back home, and I can\u2019t decide if they were being rude or just were honest. They made sure to tell me it wasn\u2019t about the modesty, it was just my stomach. I never thought about it, so maybe it\u2019s my fault for being careless and not thinking of everyone else. My husband says I was fine, but all the mothers there apparently don\u2019t think so. AITA? Edit: I did not expect this to blow up so much! I\u2019m so thankful to all the kind comments, I\u2019ve spent 20 minutes reading and upvoting there\u2019s just so many Lol. This has made me feel much better about the situation. Fortunately (or unfortunately) this isn\u2019t our usual pool and we\u2019re done lessons until next year so I won\u2019t have the chance to say anything you suggested to those people \ud83d\ude02.",

When I got my new job I did my budget and saw that I could send home roughly $1,300 a month without it affecting my personal comfort. I would still be able to save for my future and my mom and dad could retire.  So when I was home I set up a joint account for us. That way I could see is they needed more and make sure that they were not getting scammed or anything.  After about a year and a half I started noticing that there was a $200 transfer every month. I asked them about it and they said he was having difficulties with his budget so they were helping him out.  My brother doesn't need help. He is a scholarship student. He actually receives a stipend from my home government to study abroad. What he wants is money to party.  So I reduced the amount I give them by $200. Obviously they do not need it if they can afford to give it away every month.  My mom called me when she noticed and was yelling at me for being a crappy daughter and sister. I asked her to tell me exactly how much money they contributed to my party fund when I was away for school. Just so you know the answer is $0.00. They also tried to talk me out of attending  university in Canada. I'm not sure how common the idea of filial piety is in other cultures but it's a big deal in mine. She went off about it.  I told her that they didn't need the money and I had better ways to spend $200 than to gift it to my brother so he could get drunk with his friends more.  She said that I am treating them like children by restricting how they spend their money. I replied that I was not going to subsidize my brother through them. And that from now on the amount they got from me would be $1,100. And that if they sent him money again I would know and reduce their money by that amount going forward.  My brother called me to bitch me out about cutting off his money from our parents. I said that I hadn't. He was welcome to tell our parents to go back to backbreaking jobs at their age to pay for his partying in London. Then they would have my money to live off of and their wages to pay for his drinking.  My boyfriend is on my side. As are many of my friends. Most of my family and people from my culture think I am being an asshole. However for the last two months my parents have only been spending on themselves.",

I love my job and I love my friends so it has always been an easy choice for  me. However I am currently 26 weeks pregnant with my first child and trying to lessen my workload as I prepare for my maternity leave and pass larger projects over to my employees.  My friend informed me last night that she is getting married, I was of course so happy for her and congratulated her, she asked if i'd be making her dress for her and I told her of course, to just let me know when they had a date and I was told they already had a date, January 19th. That was fine, a year and five months, perfect, plenty of time to do the designs and make it and I expressed as much to her but she corrected me, it wasn't January 19 2026 like i assumed, but January 19, 2025. I was a bit shocked at this and told her that if that's the date she'd picked i'd have to take back my promise as there is no way I can make her dress in that time frame as i'll not be too long post partum.  I asked her to reconsider the date if she wanted  me to make a dress  pointing out how five months wasn't much to plan a wedding anyway but she insisted that was when she wanted it, I didn't push as it was up to her but I made it clear I will not be able to make her dress for her then.  She didn't understand this at all pointing out how i'll be taking time off work soon anyway and can't I just use that time to make her dress. I admit in hindsight I got a bit snappish here and she likely didn't realise just how much work goes into a wedding dress but I asked her if she'd hit her head and why she'd think  it's ok to ask me to put stress on my pregnancy for her wedding dress?  She has been putting messages in the group chat calling me out for it and saying how it's easy to tell who my favourites are and it's clear her feelings are hurt. I'm annoyed but also feeling a bit regretful about this, I can't trust my employees to make a wedding dress without me as their skill level isn't up to that but maybe I could have a rehearsal dinner dress made for her or even a reception dress to soothe the hurt of her not getting the custom dress she wants",

        "selftext": "My wife (38F) and I (39M) have been married for 8 years and have a 4-year-old son.  My wife's younger brother (Joe) and his GF are moving into an apartment together at the beginning of June.  But GF's lease is up at the end of April so she needed to move out of her place.  But Joe currently lives in a studio apartment so he doesn't have room for all her stuff.  So they were going to move all of GF's stuff into a storage unit for a month until they get their new place together. A little over a month ago Joe had asked my wife if we would be able to help them move GF's stuff and she agreed.  My MIL was supposed to watch our son so we could both help, but she fell ill and had to cancel.  My wife suggested trying to get a babysitter for that day but I didn't want to spend hundreds on a babysitter to help someone move, that's dumb.  And bringing a 4-year-old with us would not be helpful to anyone.   This turned into an argument between us because she said I should help them move while she watches our son since I'm stronger than she is and I know how to drive our truck with a trailer.  I told her that she should help them and have them rent a U-Haul for the day.  We compromised by telling Joe that I would help them but they need to get a U-Haul instead of using our truck and trailer.  Then, the morning of the move (this past Saturday), my wife told me that a friend of hers got suite tickets through work to a hockey game for that day and invited them.  Yes, suite tickets to a playoff hockey game.  She said she would be bringing our son since her friend was bringing her kids too.   Great, so not only do I get stuck helping someone move, but my wife and son get to go have an amazing experience together that I miss out on.  And yes, this was my son's first major sporting event and I was missing it.   And wouldn't you know it, Joe never got a U-Haul.  And his GF wasn't even close to packed up and ready when I got there.  I spent 7-8 hours and multiple trips back and forth helping them move.  All the while my wife is sending pictures to our family group chat of how much fun they're having at the hockey game.   When everyone was home that night, my wife was surprised that I wasn't in a good mood.  She said that I acted like I barely cared when our son was telling us about the hockey game and how much fun it was.  I asked her if she was seriously confused about why I was upset and she told me to tell her.   So, I started railing off all the reasons I had to be pissed off.  She volunteered me to help, she got to spend the day doing something very special with our son that I missed out on, her brother and his GF were not prepared, and I had spent the entire day doing manual labor.  I ended my little rant by telling her that she is never going to volunteer me to help her family ever again.   She told me I was overreacting and I can't hold it against her that her friend invited them to the game. She also said I'm not being fair by blaming her for Joe and his GF.  ",

        "selftext": "I (M30) started seeing June (F29) about 3 years ago. My mother has never really liked June for a couple reasons, the main one being the fact that June didn't let my mom push her around. She kept firm boundaries which I really admired and she even helped me do the same. My mom hated this, calling June controlling and wishing I hadn't broken up with my previous girlfriend Margo, who my mom loved. I was with Margo for 5 years and it was horrible. Margo was very controlling and manipulative and always guilted me into things I wasn't comfortable with. But thanks to support from friends and my sister, I was able to leave her. It was hard, but I had help and my life has improved since. My mom was very upset with this but relationships didn't last so she eventually let it go until I started dating June about a year later. When June and I announced our engagement my mom didn't freak out, which was weird considering my mom hates June. She was very calm but I just took it as she was finally accepting this and so I didn't think much of it. Everything was fine and smooth up until the wedding. I gave both my parents plus one\u2019s to the wedding since they both remarried after I graduated college. So I\u2019m not close to their spouses but gave them the option of inviting them.\u00a0 We had a very small ceremony. Just immediate family and a few close friends. After the ceremony, me and June went to take pictures and then met back with everyone we invited to the reception which was pretty big. When we got there, My sister and June\u2019s best friend/maid of honor ran up to us in a panic. Before they even said anything I spotted it. My mom was at the table with my dad, my dad's wife, and Margo. I wanted to freak but June kept me calm. I walked over, pulled them both aside, and simply told them to leave. My mom tried to explain Margo and I are soulmates and June is just in the way of true love but I wasn't hearing it. I didn't care. Just got my best friends to escort them out and I returned to the party where luckily, after a few moments, I was able to relax and enjoy it. I really didn't think this would all turn into something huge but me and June just got back from our honeymoon where we didn't have our phones, and seeing mine I saw hundreds of texts from multiple family members. They all think I was an asshole for kicking my mom out of her only son's wedding. For the record, she was there for the ceremony but apparently was really upset she was kicked from the reception. Here's a summary of my family's thoughts. Some think I could have just ignored Margo and didn't have to \u201cfreak out.\u201d A few others, including my dad, think I should have just kicked Margo and let my mom stay but after the stunt my mom pulled, I didn't want her there either. I\u2019m starting to second-guess myself since everyone is really mad. June and my sister are on my side but I fear my dad may be right and I should have just let my mom stay and made Margo leave. So I\u2019ve come to Reddit, AITA?",

        "selftext": "I(17f) have had a rocky relationship with my dad. My parents married after I was born, hoping to provide a stable family for me, but they divorced when I was 11 after my dad went to rehab, & things only worsened from there. During rehab, he met his current fianc\u00e9e, and they later had a kid(6F). Since then, my dad has been mostly absent from my life\u2014whenever I have important events, he either has an excuse or doesn\u2019t show. I\u2019d estimate he\u2019s been present for less than half of my events since their divorce. A few years ago, I was diagnosed with scoliosis, & initially, surgery wasn\u2019t needed. However, my condition got worse, & I was finally scheduled for surgery on 11/20 of this year. I told my dad about it months ago, expressing how much I needed his support this time, & he promised he\u2019d be there. But later, he texted to say he\u2019d planned a vacation that would keep him away until mid-December, just as my recovery period would be ending. It broke my heart, but I accepted it. Then, 2 hurricanes hit his vacation spot, & he told me he\u2019d make my surgery. I felt a glimmer of hope. But then, just a week before my surgery, he texted again saying his fianc\u00e9e\u2019s lung cancer surgery had been scheduled for the same day, a few hours before mine, at a hospital 30 minutes away. He said he \u201cmight not\u201d make it to my surgery, but with him, \u201cmight not\u201d usually means \u201cwon\u2019t.\u201d He added that this wasn\u2019t about who he loved more. That message shattered me. I realized that no matter how much I hoped, he might never give me the attention & support I needed. I broke down on my kitchen floor that day. After sitting with my feelings, I texted him to tell him how deeply his actions hurt me. I said it wasn\u2019t only about love but about showing care, & that he\u2019d given me hope only to let me down again. I questioned if his fianc\u00e9e\u2019s surgery had really been scheduled last minute, or if he had known earlier but hadn\u2019t told me. I asked him to show he was my dad through his actions, not just his words. He responded, insisting the surgery was only scheduled the day he\u2019d told me. But because he\u2019s lied in the past to save face, I reached out to someone who might know the truth. I then sent a follow-up message, clarifying that my frustration wasn\u2019t with his fianc\u00e9e; it was with his ongoing absence & lack of support. I said that even if his reasons were genuine, he could have at least shown some empathy. I told him I hoped he\u2019d be a better father for my half-sister than he has been for me. In a final message, I made it clear that I was done putting in all the effort to maintain our relationship on my own. I told him that if he wanted to be my dad, I would gladly be his daughter, but if he chose not to, I would be fine with that too. He hasn\u2019t responded, & honestly, I\u2019d prefer he sit with what I\u2019ve said. For once, I hope he really thinks about his actions & the impact they\u2019ve had on me. So, AITA?",

This was apparently the wrong thing to do since it led to my wife deciding that since I was never home she should bang other dudes.  When I work out of town I earn about $240,000 a year. Where I live child support for two kids is about $3,300 monthly. With that salary.  Since my divorce I went to 50/50 custody and I work in town so I only earn $100,000 yearly. So my child support is actually only $800 a month.  My ex is going nuts because she isn't getting what she thought she would. My lawyer has tried explaining that child support is based on income and since I am not working crazy hours to make lots of money for vacations and a huge house I don't need I do not earn as much.  She is telling everyone what an asshole I am for cutting back on my work to deprive my kids. That is bullshit. I have my kids half the time. And since I cannot be out of town I earn less. My kids have everything they need.  AITA?",

        "selftext": "I (F38) just got back from a vacation with two of my longtime friends, Kate (F40) and Mary (F38). I've known them both since university, and we've always been close. The three of us had been planning this Bali trip for a few months, along with our husbands and their kids (they both have children under 5, while my husband Jake (M45) and I are childfree). We agreed to split the cost of a four-bedroom villa three ways, and everything seemed fine at first. Jake and I arrived in Bali earlier than the rest of the group because we had different flights. Once we got to the villa, we waited to choose rooms with our friends and didn\u2019t mind when they both chose the ones with ensuites. We had a great time during the trip\u2014Jake and I did some couples activities (massages, hiking, dinners), but we also spent time with Kate and Mary and their families whenever it worked for everyone. To be nice, I even surprised them with massages to give them a break. The only thing that made me uncomfortable was that whenever I ordered a drink (a cocktail before dinner, or a glass of wine with meals), I'd get comments like Oh, you're drinking again? For context, I\u2019m a social drinker and don't drink often, but we were on vacation, and I didn\u2019t think it was a big deal, especially since our husbands were drinking too. I just ignored the comments so I could enjoy the trip. On the last night, Jake and I made plans with the guys to go out, and Kate and Mary said they were staying in to pack. Jake convinced me to join him, and since it was the last night of our vacation, I didn\u2019t want to stay in either. We went out and had a great time. We got home at 1am and I passed out straight after. The next morning was a bit chaotic with everyone packing and checking out, but we all made it back home without issue. We had booked business class seats back so we were separated during the flight and said quick goodbyes at the airport. A week after returning home, I got a long text from Kate saying that both she and Mary wanted to reduce contact with me because I had ruined their vacation. They mentioned several things, like me drinking every night, that I wasn\u2019t acting like a \u201cgirls\u2019 girl,\u201d that I booked different flights, didn't hang out with them enough, and that I was selfish for not helping with their kids. She even said I was just focused on partying and not acting my age.This message really hurt me.  I cried after reading it, and I honestly don\u2019t know what to think. I thought I was just enjoying my vacation, but clearly, they had a very different view. I haven\u2019t responded yet, and my husband has been asking what\u2019s bothering me, but I don\u2019t know what to say. AITA for how I acted during the trip? --- **Edit:** Thank you, Reddit, for all your kind words and support. Reading through the responses and seeing how many of you are upset on my behalf has made me reflect on how I initially planned to handle things. I was going to apologize, thinking it might be the easiest way to keep the peace, but now I realize that might not be the right approach after all. I have also showed my husband, Jake, this post and the text message, and he told me to thank you for looking out for me. He\u2019s actually pretty angry on my behalf about the text message. I showed him some of the comments that gave me insight on how my friends may have been feeling which has given us both a lot to think about. He asked me what I wanted to do next and if I wanted him to respond to my friends for me. While I appreciated the offer, I told him I\u2019m still thinking it over. He reassured me that he\u2019s here for me no matter what, and if I decide I want him to step in, he\u2019d be ready to say something on my behalf. For now, I\u2019m going to sleep on it and take some time before I respond or don't respond to the text message. If I do, I'll post an update. Again, thank you all for helping me see things a bit more clearly. I feel less alone in this now.",

This morning my mom texted me to say \u201cRent starts up again, $150 a week\u201d.  I just told her I will move out. I already pay for my own meals, I only have my small bedroom to call my own in their house. I can rent a studio apartment 3 or 4 times the size of my room for a few hundred more, or could rent a room with friends for less than my mom is trying to charge me. It would be one thing if they cooked and cleaned for me every day and I was raking up their bills but I do my own thing, pay my own bills, I never really even cross paths with my parents besides when I am getting off work.  My moms definitely pissed that I said that, I can tell. But I'm also upset the person who birthed me is trying to get me to pay what I would pay a landlord for rent just to sleep in her house.  Even 100 a week I would have been more inclined to be okay with, but 600 a month just to be able to sleep at my parents house seems a little high. If I am paying $600 a month I think I would deserve my own spaces around the house also as I would with a landlord, it seems having a landlord would be a better deal for me in this case. ",

The money was supposed to be for my future and nobody was supposed to touch it unless I really needed it and it was pretty specific. I read through it 5 months ago when shit went down. My dad got married again when I was 10 and he has an 8 year old stepdaughter and now a 4 year old daughter with his wife Louise. My half sister was diagnosed with a rare condition when she was 2. It was always clear something was wrong but they had a really hard time figuring out what it was. Doctors would say she'd be fine when she was older. This condition isn't life threatening, like she won't die from it, but it could potentially leave her permanently disabled in a bad way. A few months ago they found out about this hard to get into treatment for it. But it was expensive. There was/is ways to get help paying for it but that takes longer. So my dad decided he would use the inheritance mom left me to pay for it. He tried asking me but he was going to do it anyway and when I said no he told me as much. Then he shamed me for saying no, for putting college before the health of my half sister. Louise was in the room with us but she wasn't talking before I said no. She asked me how I could look at my half sister at the life she will have if we don't do something and say no. I told my dad I would never forgive him if he took the money. After I read her will (grandparents had a copy) I brought up the fact it was only for my needs it could be spent before. He told me mom was dead and he hoped she'd understand. I told him I never would. He told me I'd understand when I'm older. I told him I hated him and I told Louise she better never speak to me again because I found it disgusting she'd encourage stealing from me and taking my mom's money. I told my grandparents what dad did. They're my mom's parents but had stayed friendly with dad and there were times they would help him. They shared stuff with him all the time and grandpa would look at dad's car for free if anything was wrong. That all stopped when I told them. Dad couldn't figure out why until he confronted them about it last week. They told him he had some nerve stealing from me, taking their daughter's money and spending it on *his* child. My dad was mad they didn't understand and support his decision. He confronted me about it and complained about what I did. I laughed and told him I had warned him I would never forgive him for it. He asked how I got to be so heartless and selfish. I told him I would never forget what he did. AITA?",

        "selftext": "I (20f) have had three close friends in college, Grace (21f), Matt (21m), and Laura (21f). Laura really likes using mental health terminology. She explores a lot of labels from those therapist influencers online. She's was told that she has an anxiety disorder and depression but that's the only diagnosis she's been given so far. Recently she's been exploring autism and ADHD. Matt wanted to propose to Grace. They've been dating for a while. He's been planning the proposal for a couple of weeks and while the proposal was very intimate between the two of them I was very involved in scheduling the after-proposal event at a restaurant. The specifics of that are irrelevant to the story but it was lovely and Grace and Matt seemed really happy. Laura told us that she didn't want to be involved in planning the proposal because it reminded her of her parents' divorce. She said that she might come to the post-engagement party. Well come the day of the engagement and both Matt and I forget to check in on Laura. I don't think it's Matt's fault at all because he was occupied with far more important things but I feel a bit guilty about not reminding her. She ended up not coming to the party. The next day she starts posting online some dramatic (for lack of a better word) things about how it was traumatizing to see how little her friends cared about her, and that she'll be updating her followers on her trauma therapy journey. She posts that she's now in a really dark place and she thinks she has PTSD. For context, I'm pretty sensitive to mentions of trauma and PTSD because I was diagnosed with PTSD by a psychologist in my last year of high school after something that happened in my first. I've felt a lot of guilt and shame around this because I spent a lot of time feeling that the thing that happened wasn't bad enough to count. I sometimes still get nightmares and flashbacks but it's gotten better after therapy. I know that I have my own issues wrapped up regarding the word and it bothers me a lot when people seem to throw the terms around without understanding their weight but I also acknowledge that I can't stop the internet from doing its thing. I haven't told any of my college friends about this, so Laura doesn't know. At one point she called me and starting explaining how traumatized she is and I finally snapped and said, You're not traumatized, stop being dramatic, you just got exactly what you asked for. Now I feel guilty because I feel like I was a little harsh, and she's posting online (without my name at least) that one friend that she thought she could rely on to support her is abusive and doesn't understand how being traumatized works. However, I feel like honestly, Laura's being very dramatic about an event that's not about her. I called my mom to see what her opinion is and she told me that I could've reminded Laura about the party and while my point is not necessarily wrong, I could've been more sensitive, so now I'm not sure how wrong I am.",

        "selftext": "I kind of know I am the asshole, but I need to know how bad it was. My brother is 29 and has been with Lia for about 2 years. We all like her; she is super nice. I am getting married next April and sent an invite to my brother's apartment. We decided to send invites to households and not individuals. For example, our aunt received an invite for her family and not for each individual. Last Thursday, we met at my parents' place. It was just the core family because of some tax reasons, lol. While there, I asked my brother about Lia's dietary restrictions. I know that she is a vegetarian for health reasons and that she cannot have certain raw vegetables. He said that she wasn't going to come and that he was taking his girl best friend, Amanda, instead. Now, their relationship is weird af. Amanda has always been stringing my brother along, in my opinion. He always denies having feelings for her, but let's be real here. Amanda would date other guys, blow off my brother, then when things were on the decline with her partners, she would be attached to him again. Her last boyfriend broke up with her right around the time my brother, his then ex-girlfriend, Amanda, and her ex were supposed to travel to Spain. What did my idiot brother do? Go with Amanda alone because Amanda was uncomfortable with his ex-girlfriend. Obviously, he acted blindsided when his girlfriend broke up with him. I didn't even say anything anymore because it's all so weird. So, when he said that, I asked if Lia already had other plans. But my brother said that Amanda had asked if she could come because it would be an opportunity to finally see the old gang (we were in the same friend group in high school). I told him that I would have invited Amanda if I wanted her there. Amanda is mean and cold. She always makes disparaging comments about other girls. At every event, around one hour in, she will make some sort of scene that either has her running away crying or sitting mad at a table telling everyone to leave her alone and then making a cryptic comment about something hurting her. I told my brother I was revoking his plus one and Amanda was NOT coming to our wedding. He accused me of being misogynistic and bigoted because I don't understand opposite-sex friendships. Which is BS. My husband has a female childhood friend who is his best woman. I love her too and she has been amazing. AND SHE RESPECTS FUCKING BOUNDARIES. She always includes me and made a huge effort when I started dating my fianc\u00e9 to integrate me into the friend group. Anyway, I said my decision was final. He could take it or leave it, but I would be inviting Lia myself because I like her. He screamed at me and told me to keep out of his business. I said to get rid of his weird fucking feelings for Amanda.He is mad at me. My dad said is none of our deal. My mom is furious with my brother. So Aita? Edit: to answer some questions  The invite was addressed to the smith's. Funnily enough, Lia had the same last name as us. Granted, we have one of the most common last names. Yes, they live together. The tax thing is nothing huge. My parents have a small buisness but are really bad at keeping track of all their receipts. So every month we go and help them. We digitalis the receipts and put them in a bookkeeping software for the accountant *Amanda is in the comments. Say hi!*",

We actually own 2 parcels, and I offered her to sell one parcel to her siblings for market value, but she declined. The house will be paid by me. I told her if her family want, I can do an ADU, but they will pay market value for their rent, per room. So, about 900 each. She declined.

        "selftext": "Apologies in advance as I had a hard time writing the situation in a single sentence. My brother has been trying to push me to get closer to his girlfriend Mary (together 3 months). I've done my best to get to know her (initiating dinners, trying her hobbies with her, etc.) but we honestly don't really get along.  I personally think she's a snob (she complimented my designer bag, but took the compliment back when she found out it was thrifted. As in literally said yike, I take that back) while she thinks I lack culture and sophistication (also something she's mentioned when trying to convince me to do a makeover with her).  The issue is that I'm getting married this year, and my brother has been REALLY trying to get her involved. I put my foot down with the bridal party since they've only been dating for 3 months and I don't know her, but he insisted that I invite her to the bachelorette. It was originally supposed to be super lowkey and local. Mary tried to push for something more extravagant, but it really wasn't in my budget. When I wouldn't budge, she told us something came up that weekend and she couldn't go.  I was later surprised by my friends who had come together to organize a lavish weekend through favors and points (i.e. one of my friend's aunts works for a spa, so she was able to get discounted packages, another used her travel points to book a suite, etc.). I was not told about this, and was truly and happily surprised.  The issue is that Mary found out when we posted pictures and she was PISSED. My brother is now saying that I deliberately left her out, but she told me she was busy! Mary said that if she had known what the weekend was like though, she would have rearranged her schedule. I feel conflicted because I suspect that my friends didn't tell Mary on purpose, but they're claiming they made these plans after Mary bowed out and didn't reach back out since she was busy.  My brother still says I should have double checked and made more of an effort to let Mary know my plants, so I figured I'd ask the internet for their thoughts!",

        "selftext": "Hello AITA-- We are at the beginning of my dad's retirement family trip. He is paying for all of us to meet as a family in Hawaii for a week since he is retiring after working at the same company for 42 years. There are six of us but my brother and I live in the same part of the country.  I guess it's relevant to say I am 5'1 and my brother is 6'6. I fly all the time for work and have quite a bit of status with the airline for which my dad bought our tickets.  This is what happened way earlier today. We were all boarded and ready to go when a flight attendant came up to me and whispered that they had a first class passenger not show up and they needed the coach seat to accommodate a standby passenger. She said I had by far the most status of anyone on the plane so they were willing to move me to first class for free. I was like oh yeah--and I took it in a heartbeat. I told my brother I'd see him in 12 hours and let me know if he wanted any food or drink and I grabbed my stuff and moved. Needless to say I had a nice flight.  When we landed and were waiting for our shuttle my brother was so pissy but wouldn't tell me what was going on. He didn't speak to me the whole shuttle ride. We had a nice hello with the rest of the family but after I got down from my shower my mom took me aside and said what I did was awful. I asked her what she was talking about and she said that I should have given my brother the seat. I thought that would be the end of it but all 5 of my siblings and my parents are upset with me and the vacation is off to a very rough start.  I was trying to play with my niece and nephew in the lobby waiting for lunch and my sister said no they only like to play with people who give a shit about their family--what were you thinking? I asked her if this was about the first class thing and she said what do you think its about? I said that he never asked me to switch with him, she said an asshole makes people beg, family members don't. I've been by myself since brunch and not having much fun. AITA? Edit: wow this totally blew up, thank you for commenting everyone. I only saw my family for a little but yesterday and they were still made at me to varying degrees. I have a really good friend that lives here in the military so she hung out with and we met some really fun and cute guys at a dive bar. So my vacation will be great no matter what. But reading your comments really gave me to confidence to not give a crap (or try to at least!) thank you.",

        "selftext": "So I (16M) still live with my family, obviously. I have chores just like my siblings. But something I do for fun and because I love and have a passion for it is cooking. I started cooking for myself 3 years ago. I had cooked before but nothing like the last three years. I enjoy making my own breakfast and dinner and even lunch if I have no school. My parents saw I was cooking more and they added that to my list of chores because mom said they didn't want to waste food and dad said it was rude to cook for only one person. And I didn't mind cooking for everyone. But they were so fucking ungrateful. My siblings and parents alike. Complaints I got were: Too spicy, wanted potatoes instead of rice, wanted rice instead of noodles, wanted beef instead of chicken, wanted something plain instead of spicy, wanted no veggies, wanted a more veggie focused meal, wanted lasagna instead of pasta bake, didn't want soup, didn't like the flavor of soup, didn't want something sweet, wanted something sweet, changed mind and wanted meat well done, wanted more kinds of potatoes and the list goes on. None of this was constructive either. It was whining and complaining and I did start out asking what I should do but everyone wanted something different and I'm still in school!! I can't spend 6 hours cooking dinner on a school night so my siblings can have pizza, fries, nuggets, tacos and my parents can have steak and potatoes and gravy and all the trimmings or none of the trimmings but five different kinds of potatoes. I even made a weekly meal plan for a while and they wouldn't complain until after they ate it. I spoke to my family about the way they were behaving and my mom told me that's the reality of cooking for a family. She said my siblings and dad had always been like that with her. I pointed out I hadn't been and she just said that and she said yeah but it's part of life. I told her so she decided to treat me worse than I treated her and she told me I was being difficult and I told her no, she was taking everyone else's behavior out on me. A few times my dad or one of my siblings would say I wasn't a very good cook and they hated eating my food. So I said I wouldn't cook anymore and dad and mom would get pissed and my siblings would call me lame. So I stopped cooking for them. I cook just for me again and my parents are furious. They all come home hungry and I have nothing ready for them. Not even my siblings. My parents told me it's disrespectful and I cannot continue and I said they were all the disrespectful and ungrateful ones shitting all over what I made for them. They told me I shouldn't be okay with letting them go hungry and I said they all deserve to go hungry. My parents said it was a disgusting attitude and they grounded me for two weeks. AITA?",

The family members ( mostly women) will go  over and do all those chores. So cooking, cleaning, shopping etc. She explained this to me and it happens for a few weeks after the birth.   She is not close to her family and it was asked of me to come up for a few weeks and do this. My son will be back on call a week and a half after she gives birth.  She is suppose to give birth in about a month and I was talking about logistics of the whole thing. I asked were I would sleep  and she informed me that I will need to get a hotel. This shocked me since they own a nice home.  I thought it over and decided I do not want to do this. I was already going to be doing them a huge favor by being a live in maid. I was going to use all my PTO for this and now I will have to also live in a hotel. This isn\u2019t even a culture I am a part of.  I informed her that I will not be able to come up for the time she wanted if I have to stay in a hotel. I am willing to come up for a weekend at most if I can not stay in their home.

        "selftext": "This post is about my son and Amy (my DIL) they have been married for about ten years and have two kids. They are 10 and 6. At the beginning I really tried to get along with her but she made it difficult. She is not very sociable, and always put her own mom over seeing her husbands side of the family. This is really apparent with holidays and the kids. She always choses to go to her moms for holiday even if I do it on an early day or late day. If I offer to babysit she always tells me she asked her mom or she would get back to me. The time I do babysit or get to hang out with the grandkids she is criticizing everything I do. Usually saying that not how her mom or how she does it. At the beginning my son was trying to fix this but gave up. We see him separately from his wife and kids. I truly don\u2019t understand it and I have asked if I did anything wrong but no answer on that. I gave up trying when my other son had kids. It is so much better and I have a great relationship with my other DIL and the kids. The kids are 9 (Ava my step-grandaughter) and 4 (grandson) I gave my Ava a family necklaces, that was my mothers. She loves it and has been wearing it everywhere according to my son. That also includes school which started this issue. My DIL called me up and asked why Ava got a family necklace but her daughter (10) didn\u2019t get one. I told her I just wanted to give it to Ava.  She got angry and told me I was playing favorite and that her daughter is older so she should have gotten the necklace. I told her that yes I am playing favorites and  it is due to her. I pointed out that I do not know her daughter because of her. That her kids will not be getting any of my family stuff because of her.  This was a huge argument and she called some a jerk and wanted me to give her kid a necklace. I am doubting myself on this ",

        "selftext": "My son \u201cGeorge\u201d just turned 13 this month.  George is very bright, projected to get 8s or 9s in his GCSEs, and regularly achieves these grades in his mock exams and assessments. But he struggles socially and has been bullied badly in the past. Things are better now, but he isn\u2019t popular.  As part of his PD class, he had to create a children\u2019s toy and give a sales pitch to the class. Last Friday was the presentation day, and George was really excited. He\u2019d put a lot of effort into his toy and the presentation. But I got a notification saying George had been given a C3 (after-school detention), something he\u2019s never received before. As he\u2019d refused to participate in class and didn\u2019t do his presentation. When I picked him up, I could tell immediately that he was upset. I asked him what happened and why he didn\u2019t do the presentation. He said he didn\u2019t refuse the presentation; when it was his turn, he asked to go later. His teacher said no, and that he had to do it then or get a C3. George said he \u201ccouldn\u2019t do it now,\u201d but didn\u2019t explain further when asked, so he was given the C3. I kept pressing him, worried that maybe he was being bullied again. Eventually, he told me the real reason: he had a random erection just before his turn and, no matter what, it \u201cwouldn\u2019t go down\u201d. With that info, I think George\u2019s request was perfectly reasonable. He didn\u2019t refuse to do the presentation\u2014he simply asked to do it a little later. Obviously, he didn\u2019t want to explain the reason in front of the whole class when the teacher asked him. His mum was really angry with him for getting the C3. I explained what happened and said I didn\u2019t think George was wrong. I said I\u2019m not supporting the detention and would pick him up at the normal time. When I told his mum what happened, she looked disgusted and said something like, \u201cWhy did he even have one in class to begin with?\u201d I explained that random erections happen, especially in early puberty, and they don\u2019t always relate to sexual thoughts, which is what she was assuming. She replied, \u201cWell, I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s true,\u201d dismissing what I said. So I told her, \u201cYou might not be sure, but I am.\u201d She insisted we needed to present a united front, along with the school, and that by going against her, I was sending George the wrong message. I asked why her way of handling it was automatically right and why I should be the one to concede. It escalated into a big argument, which we haven\u2019t had in years.  She\u2019s saying she is going to punish him for refusing when it\u2019s her week with him next week and that I am being an AH for \u201cgoing against her\u201d. Her mother text me saying I was setting a bad example for George by letting him get away with being disrespectful to his teacher. Which he wasn\u2019t even, just asked to do his presentation later. I respectfully told her she should mind her own business, and that George was my son.  But now I\u2019m worrying whether I\u2019ve done the right thing, and I need some outside perspectives. ",

        "selftext": "I (17m) might be TA and I might be a big one but I wanted to get people's insight. So my dad left my mom when I was 14 to be with his wife/the woman he was cheating on my mom with. My dad didn't want me to think badly of him but I did. He knew I did and he knew he couldn't change my mind easily. We always knew my parents would end up with shared custody until I was 17 at least (from experience the judges in family court will only stop enforcing shared custody when a kid turns 17 and speaks out, any younger and they insist on 50/50). I also knew mom would struggle on her own because while she did work, she never made as much as my dad. She also wouldn't get child support because of the 50/50 and it wasn't ordered even with the difference in income. So when dad pleaded with me to give him a chance to show he could still be a good dad and he said he would do anything for me, I told him to keep supporting mom and make sure she wasn't going to end up struggling while he got off easy. I told him she deserved that at least, after what he did, and that I deserved to see my mom doing well. My dad agreed and he paid it as child support instead of spousal support or whatever it's called. It really helped mom and she actually went back to school so she could get a better job. Dad is still paying that money. He knows I appreciate him doing it and he also knows it's one of the only reasons I didn't just decide to say fuck him and never want a relationship again. My mom is also less stressed. She has mixed feelings about my dad giving her money when legally he doesn't need to. But she also knows this is the only way for me not to feel the need to help support her. Where my dad's wife comes into it is this. She never liked that my dad paid this child support. She never liked that I insisted on it for my dad and I to have a relationship. But now my dad's house is struggling a bit and some changes needed to be made. His wife's son and daughter were in dance, football, softball, karate, music lessons and an art class as paid extra curricular's. My dad and his wife also have a baby together. The wife's kids had to cut two activities because they can't afford it anymore. It pisses his wife off because if dad wasn't paying the money they could still afford those things. She told me I should stop obligating my dad to support mom because they need it more and my mom isn't their problem. I told her she and her kids are not my problem. She told me they're my family while mom is not her or her kids' family or my dad's anymore. I told her she and her kids are dad's family but not mine. She told me they need all of dad's money right now before more things need to be cut back on. I shrugged in response. She told me I was so callously flippant and it wasn't a good look to care so little about my siblings lives (only one of her kids, the baby, is technically my half sibling). AITA?",

        "selftext": "I rent my basement suite out to my mom's best friend's daughter, Sally. I knew her growing up and I used to babysit her.  The basement has two means of escape other than going into my area. It is fully up to code as an in-law suite. There is no reason for anyone to go through it into my space. I went on vacation and I left my door to the basement deadbolted. Three days into my vacation I get an alert on my phone that there is an unauthorized event at my house. I look at the video. It's my mom opening the door for Sally's mom. They freak out when the alarm goes off. Usually if I need my mom to get into my apartment I will give her a temporary code. It is always the same one because she gets confused by tech. But I have to activate it beforehand. I cannot do it retroactively. The only choice would be to call her and give her my personal code.  I checked the cameras in the house and strangely enough my house is not on fire. I didn't leave the faucet running. There is no emergency.  This is where I might be the asshole. Once I saw they were just fucking with my area for no good reason I put my phone on airplane mode and went back to the party.  Maybe 90 minutes later a concierge at the resort came and said I was urgently needed on the phone. My dad has written down my whereabouts and they called the front desk for me. I excused myself and went for the call.  I asked my mom what the emergency was, why was she getting me out of my friend's wedding reception, was my house okay, was my dad okay. She very brusquely told me to shut up and talk to the cops and the security patrol.  I talked to them and apologized for wasting their time. I asked them what the emergency was that brought my mother into my house. They handed her back the phone and let her tell me that her friend did not want to sit in the basement while she was visiting her daughter. So my mom agreed to come let them use my area and it would be a secret.  I asked the security company to please lock my house back up and take my key back from my mother. She started to protest but I hung up.  I enjoyed the rest of my trip and my dad has agreed to pay any fines or penalties that come from the false alarm.  Sally's mom wants her to move out. That's fine by me I don't need a tenant and was only doing it as a favor. Sally is almost apoplectic begging me not to kick her out. She said that she didn't even know what our moms were up to until the alarm went off.  My mom is pissed that I wasn't available immediately to get them out of trouble and she is furious that I won't give her back my key. She thinks I did it on purpose. I'm not sure how she thinks I forced her to break into my home without permission.  So am I the asshole for making them sweat until they got ahold of me? And taking my key back since I can't trust her now.",

I\u2019ve got a couple of years at best estimate to get everything in order before I won\u2019t have the cognitive ability to do so anymore. I\u2019ve been working with a lawyer and an end of life care social worker to make sure everything will go as smoothly as possible and my wishes will be respected. I also have a complicated family situation.  My parents were never married and my dad died when I was 12 of the same condition I now have. He never married so all his assets were put in a trust for me by my grandparents. My mom married after they broke up and had my half-brother (26M).  He is severely mentally disabled. He\u2019s a 7 year old in a grown man\u2019s body and even with all the resources they can get, he\u2019s very difficult to care for and my mom and step-dad barely get by most of the time.  They tried really hard to get legal control of my trust when I was living with them, but couldn\u2019t. I help out some when things are really hard, but I feel like my mom treats me like an emergency fund rather than her daughter and my step-dad has been bitter about the financial stuff (my dad was very successful and his family is well off) since even before my dad died. I don\u2019t talk to either of them about my life because they always get passive aggressive and guilt-trippy. I\u2019ve been trying to talk more with my mom now that I know I\u2019m on borrowed time. We\u2019ve never had a great relationship, but I wanted to try and resolve some of it. She\u2019s been much nicer to me and more concerned since the diagnosis, so I thought it was ok to open up a bit.  I didn\u2019t want her to be blind-sided or feel like she has to take on anything since I\u2019ve appointed another family member to be my medical and financial POA, so I talked to her recently about my plans. I told her that I know my half-brother is a full time job so I\u2019m having other people take care of my care so she won\u2019t be burdened. She was thankful for that, but then brought up how she always hoped that I would be the one to make sure my brother was taken care of when she was gone and that in a way I still would be. She would put whatever I leave behind into his care fund and would make sure he knows it\u2019s from his big sister. This is where I might be the AH.  I\u2019m not leaving anything to my mom or brother. I don\u2019t have kids, but I have been the favorite \u201cauntie\u201d to my best friend\u2019s two children for their entire lives. They are the light of my life and I spend a lot of time with them.  My BFF and I have been through a lot together. She and her husband have been the ones going with me to appointments and letting me crash in their spare room when I was too sick from meds to be home alone.  Whatever is left over after I\u2019m gone is going to the kids for college. I know it\u2019s money that could secure better care for my half-brother and take some of the load off my mom, but I feel like I want to help someone else now. Edit - Thank you for the best wishes. To answer a couple of questions: (a) I am not at all close to my half-brother, I didn\u2019t really meet him until my dad passed and the 6 years I spent around him were painful and frightening. I haven\u2019t seen him in person in 15 years. It\u2019s not clear that he even understands that he has a sister or what that means and I would be really surprised if he remembered me at all. So, it\u2019s not that I don\u2019t care - I care to the same extent that I would about the welfare of any random mentally disabled stranger - I just don\u2019t have any special interest or warm family feelings about him because we share DNA. I\u2019ve also already put a lot of money into helping my mom stay solvent to care for him, so there\u2019s an argument to be made that he\u2019s already received a reasonable share of benefit in life. As much as my mom refuses to believe it, I would never have accepted legal responsibility for him after her death. His dad has family that could step in if they were willing. (b) I am working with a good team already to get things in order. My estate lawyer is very good at his job and he and my financial advisor are prepared to firmly lock down everything once I\u2019ve made the final decisions about where my assets should go. I trust my executor. So, that side of things and the medical and logistics planning is being well taken care of, don\u2019t worry. I just have to make a few hard decisions that I didn\u2019t expect to ever have to make. Thinking about some things people have said in this thread, it may be just be time to end the sentence on my relationship with my mom and her family and move on. I\u2019ve always held out hope that she cared in her own way and that things could be better, but I\u2019m really tired and I\u2019m not sure I want to spend what\u2019s left of my time chasing it and trying to figure out whether she can even be trusted to manage any money I could leave to them. The SW offered to set up a few family sessions with a counselor that specializes in terminal family member issues, so I might let that be the weathervane.",

        "selftext": "Both me (33F) and my sister (27F) are caucasian latinas. However, she's always been more tan than me, a fact she's always been very proud of. For reference, my skin tone is close to Aubrey Plaza's, while hers is closer to Gina Rodriguez's. When we were younger, she would constantly talk about how European I looked compared to her, how my hair looked more blonde than brown (which no one ever agreed with), and how certain colors I liked looked awful on me due to my skin tone. I almost never said anything because I was six years older and had better things to do. Also, while I did have many insecurities, I never doubted I was beautiful. Fast forward to now, we both have kids. My husband is a little more tan than me, and both our children (8M and 3F) have the same skin tone as their father. My sister's ex (and baby daddy), however, was a very pale Swiss guy. My niece (5F) is a fair-skinned girl with dark blonde hair, while my daughter is more tan and has dark brown hair. Everyone agrees that both girls are beautiful, but their skin tones have always bugged my sister. She insists that both girls are equally tan, that her daughter's hair is light brown, and that my daughter spends too much time in the sun. Last weekend, we all had dinner at my father's place. My son brought his notebook and drew pictures of everyone at the table. He colored my daughter's skin a darker shade than my niece **(edit: orange for my daughter, light pink for my niece)**. He also gave my niece yellow hair and colored my daughter's hair black (he lost his brown pencil). When we showed us the drawings, my sister frowned. She said he was exaggerating his cousin's features, and that he could at least make her hair darker. When my niece said she loved the drawing, my sister told her it looked nothing like her, and insisted my son was doing this on purpose. Before the kids could get upset, I pulled my sister aside and told her she was being ridiculous. We had a (very small) fight in the next room. Near its end, I said something along the lines of, Listen to me. Your daughter is white. We're all white. You need to accept that and stop comparing the girls if you don't want (niece's name) to become insecure. We left shortly afterwards and none of the kids have brought anything up again. My sister is pissed at me. She told both our (divorced) parents about our fight. Our father thinks I shouldn't have commented on my niece's appearance, and wants me to apologize to my sister. Our mom thinks this is dumb (I agree), but says my sister is overreacting. AITA?",

Not just a couple of minutes late, usually 20-30 mins or more and they don't ever tell us they are going to be late.  On Halloween they were supposed to be here at 6:30 to go trick-or-treating, my kids are teens so they already had plans but cancelled to spend time with them instead. At 7:15 we called and they said they were '5 mins away'.  22 minutes later, they arrived without any concerns.  This inspired a new rule for me, I called it the 5 min rule. Basically, if you tell me you're gonna be somewhere at a time and aren't, after 5 mins I will leave. If we are meeting to eat or something, and you're late, we will order and eat without you, we will leave when we finish even if they are just getting there.  Tonight they had plans to take my kids out for dinner, they said they'd be here at 7. We talked at 2p and I reminded them of the new rule. At 7:05 they weren't here and had not called or anything, so I called them. They said they were 10 mins away. I told them to not bother with it, they tried to ask me to give them another chance  since they live an hour away, and I said no way and stuck to it.  I feel like they are disrespectful by doing this and that they aren't valuing my time. AITA?",

When it comes to gifts my daughter (Maddie 7) get things from the dollar store while my nephews get whole Lego sets, iPads and even Disney trips. If my sister needs babysitting they will drop everything for her last minute. If I need it I have to give them a two week\u2019s heads up as well as proper payment.  Because of this clear favoritism my daughter doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with them. If you as her about her grandparents her mind automatically goes to my husband\u2019s parents because she forgets that she has two pairs.  Earlier today we having a rare meet up with my parents. My daughter asked if she can go on the trampoline outside. My dad said no because it\u2019s for my nephews. My daughter begged but dad still said no. Maddie then stomps away and said this is why I like other grandma and grandpa more. My parents looked at me expectantly but I didn\u2019t do anything. I recently got off a call with my mom saying I should have told Maddie that was wrong to say. I told her what do you expect she thinks y\u2019all hate her and y\u2019all do nothing to dispel those thoughts. She just got quiet for a bit then said I still shouldn\u2019t let her say something like that to family and hung up.  My husband is on my side but he also isn\u2019t a fan of my family so I need an outside opinion AITA?  Edit: to make some of you feel better we don\u2019t bring her around them often she only sees them on holidays with the rest of our extended family.  We were only visiting today to get something I was left in a will. As for babysitting I have only asked twice in extreme emergencies and they said no. I have talked to them about this but they say it\u2019s not favoritism she just needs less help because we are better off.  Update: just got off the phone with my uncle. Apparently dad called him ranting about how disrespectful we are.  Apparently this all stems from me going to college. Dad said since I had to be all hoity toity and go to college I shouldn\u2019t need his help and I should be living the easy life. He also said I\u2019m selfish for trying to take help away from those who need it. Not sure what to think about all that he\u2019s never brought up having a problem with that before. I\u2019m going to discuss this with the rest of the family because with the holidays approaching I don\u2019t want to cut everybody else out to avoid them so I\u2019m going to ask how they feel about all this.",

Although they had the same upbringing, Jake sadly surrounding himself with the wrong people during his late teenage years and made some bad life decisions. Since he was around 17, he's suffered with substance abuse issues and alcohol dependency. He's been through counselling on more than one occasion, and I've lost count of the amount of times that either my wife or I have had to make personal sacrifices to go and tend to him. He's currently living in a Recovery Housing Program, where we hoped he would see improvements. This has caused understandable issues for Jess. I've missed hockey games and choir performances because I had to go tend to Jake, as has my wife. We try and make it up to her at the time, but I don't think missing important milestones really makes up for it; it's heartbreaking for me personally.  Jake has been doing better lately, and he hasn't had any relapses or issues for the past few months. Jess' graduation was the other day, and my wife and I had tickets and couldn't wait. She's off to college, graduating with a great GPA and we're really proud of her.  However, only a couple of hours before the graduation, we received a call from the staff at Jake's Housing Program, who said that he had a relapse incident and was in a really bad way. My wife was hysterical and immediately started telling me we had to go there and help. I refused. I said that we'd missed enough events in Jess' life, and I wasn't missing her graduation. Although my wife told me how sad she was to miss it, Jake's health and wellbeing would take priority. I wasn't changing my stance. She got increasingly agitated and said she'd go herself, called a cab, and went. I took the car and watched Jess' graduation. It was one of the proudest days of my life, but when I saw Jess at the end, I could tell she was visibly upset that her mom wasn't there. I explained and you could tell her frustration. My wife made it to our celebratory dinner later, and she apologized, but the mood was sour. The incident with Jake was serious, but not a life threatening emergency, and he has been admitted into treatment.  My wife gave me the cold shoulder later saying how we should have been on the same page, been there for support, and that I'd been selfish. I disagreed, saying she'd been selfish in this scenario, and she tainted Jess' moment. This went on for a while, and I ended up sleeping on the couch.  I still feel I made the right decision, but I know I hurt my wife, and Jake's recovery is obviously of paramount importance as well. AITA?",

        "selftext": "Hey Reddit, I (26F) need some serious perspective. I\u2019m starting to think I might be the asshole, but I still feel like I\u2019m in the right lol. Every New Year\u2019s Eve, my family has a big party at my aunt and uncle\u2019s house and every year, without fail, I end up being the DD. Don\u2019t get me wrong I love my family, but it\u2019s starting to bug me. It\u2019s been like this since I was 19, even before I was legally allowed to drink. I don\u2019t drink much\u2014maybe a glass of wine or a beer, but I don\u2019t get plastered. I\u2019m fine with driving people home if they need it, but for the past few years, everyone expects me to not drink so I can drive them back. Every year, it\u2019s the same: \u201cOh, can you drive? You\u2019re not drinking anyway!\u201d I always say yes because I don\u2019t want to let anyone down. Fast forward to this year\u2019s New Year\u2019s Eve. I told my family ahead of time I wasn\u2019t going to be the DD anymore. I just wanted to enjoy the night, have a couple of drinks, and not be responsible for getting everyone home. I even told my cousin who usually gets really sloshed that I wasn\u2019t driving this year, and she was fine with it. When I got to the party, it was the usual chaos. People were drinking, laughing, and having a good time. I was enjoying myself, but around 11, my cousin came over and asked if I was ready to drive everyone home. I reminded her I\u2019m not driving tonight, I\u2019m here to enjoy the party. She looked at me like I was crazy and said, \u201cCome on, you always drive! Don\u2019t be a bitch.\u201d Which like, wtf? I tried to explain calmly that I wasn\u2019t being a bitch, just that I wasn\u2019t going to be the chauffeur anymore. Then, my aunt overheard and pulled me aside. She lectured me, saying, \u201cWe all agreed last year you\u2019d be driving. You know how much we rely on you. Everyone else is too tipsy, and Ubering is so unsafe. Just drive this one time, for the family.\u201d I felt a ton of pressure but refused I told her I\u2019m not their chaufeur and wasn\u2019t going to do it again just because no one else could figure out their own ride. My aunt got upset, saying I was being selfish and that we\u2019re family. She said I\u2019m the only one who doesn\u2019t get \u2018too drunk,\u2019 so it makes sense for me to help out. I told her I had already had three beers, so I wasn\u2019t even legally supposed to drive myself. That\u2019s when I snapped. I told them it\u2019s not my job to be their DD every year just because I\u2019m the only one who doesn\u2019t get blackout drunk. They needed to figure out their own rides this time. Then I got up and left. I felt bad walking out, but I didn\u2019t want to be a doormat anymore. I spent the rest of New Year\u2019s Eve at home, watching Netflix and eating leftover pasta with my boyfriend. My family texted me, calling me dramatic, selfish, and saying I ruined the night. They said I was being \u201csuper sensitive\u201d and that everyone was \u201cdisapointed\u201d in me. Everyone's demanding an apology out of me even now. And by the way, I got home perfectly safe by Uber. But anyways, Reddit, AITA?",

Things have been going well and one of the great things is that Felix is a builder and so everything with the nursery went pretty smoothly pretty fast! We agreed at the start what kind of vibe we wanted to go with it and it's pretty much already done. Figured that we'd get it sorted as soon as possible so it wasn't another thing to worry about later. My MIL has always been a bit of a nightmare but has been better since the news that I'm pregnant (though not without issue - for example, she told me that I should lose some weight and that it wasn't heathy for me or the baby. She knows that I used to struggle with anorexia and I'm not any sort of unhealthy weight). In the past I've kept my mouth shut and let Felix deal with her. As the nursery has almost been completed, she's suddenly decided to invite herself around more - I work from home currently, she comes in on the regular, asks me when I'm going to have lunch and oh could you just pop me something in too! and then will wander into the nursery and start rearranging things. I know this sounds stupid but once she literally bought an IKEA bag full of stuff that she put in there. It doesn't match. But I've never said anything really beyond, Oh, thanks so much for the thought etc. Yesterday when she came around uninvited, she looked me up and down and said Really? Joggers? Thank god Felix isn't here and then walked into the nursery and started asking me where the pillow she'd put in the crib had gone, why I'd taken out the fairylights hanging on the wall right by it, etc. I explained that they were potential safety hazards to the future baby and that I'd taken them out. She started with, Oh, well, *I've* had three children and I really think you should take more of my advice and then looked me in the eyes and said You're really not going to be a good mother at this rate. I don't know if it was the pregnancy hormones but I just stared at her for a moment and then told her to get out of the house. I'd been up all night and had loads of work and wasn't in the mood. She got very uptight about it and then left. Felix says he's going to talk to her and tell her that she shouldn't be reorganising anything without our permission, but I don't know if it was just the hormones and I'm being unreasonable. AITA?

She constantly lays on the \u201csouthern charm\u201d thing thick. She calls everyone \u201choney\u201d and \u201csweetie\u201d and all of that. She also tends to chit chat with people instead of just letting them eat after bringing them their food or drinks. It\u2019s also kind of obvious that a lot of them don\u2019t want to really talk to her, they give one word answers and she just barrels forward and talks at them.  (Management has told her off more than once for this)  About two weeks ago she was upset because a customer yelled at her and said \u201cDon\u2019t call me that!\u201d when she called her \u201choney\u201d and she complains that she\u2019s not getting as many tips as the other servers. She says it\u2019s because she has a southern accent and customers think she\u2019s stupid, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case.  She asked me for advice, and I said it\u2019s because she takes so long to bring things out and wastes time trying to make small talk. I also said that the excessive pet names sound kind of condescending, and they aren\u2019t really something you would call a stranger here.  She told me that she wasn\u2019t going to start being rude to customers because she would make even less money. I told her it\u2019s not being rude, it\u2019s just how things work here, and it\u2019s rude to other customers she\u2019s supposed to be serving when she spends all her time trying to make small talk instead of doing her job and calling them weird things.

        "selftext": " 2 y (ish)* ago, my brother, my nephew and my mother were in a car accident. My mother died instantly, my brother and nephew passed away the next day. My family was small, me, my husband, daughter, parents, brother, wife and  2 nephewsv(edited) . Their loss was devastating for my life and for everyone, even worse for my father and my SIL.  1 year ago, my daughter, Betty (25F) was proposed by her fianc\u00e9 and preparations began. During this process, they chose the date based on the day they met (added:7y ago ) and that day is exactly 2 years since the death of my brother and nephew. I tried to talk to her about moving, because it is still a very difficult date for our family and even for myself, but she insisted saying that the venue had that date available and it would be perfect, because all the other available dates aren't so good and wouldn't be so important. I respected her decision.  Recently, she sent the invitations to everyone and, as I predicted, my SIL, my nephew (24M) and my father responded that they would not attend and despite not telling her, my father and SIL told me that the date choice was sound an offense to them. I decided to remain neutral at some point, I confirmed my presence and my husband.  Today my daughter called me unhappy that no one but us confirmed (my husband doesn't have family on his side) and her family part was empty and she expected everyone to go on that date, even more so after she explained the reason to them abou the date, but they still refused.  I tried to be supportive, but I said Love, this date is difficult even for me, but I will go to your wedding, but you have to understand that this choice of date had this consequence and you would have to deal with the consequences of your choices.  She exploded at me, saying that everyone was against her, it's not her fault the dates coincided and everyone could make an effort to go a few hours for her, but they decided to just not go and I was basically saying I told you so.  She hung up without me answering and we still haven't spoken.  My husband said he understands me, but I should have stayed away from it  AITA?",

        "selftext": "Growing up, my dad stayed at home while my mom worked. While my mom financially provided for my sister and myself, she was emotionally hands off. She came to a ballet recital here and there but didn\u2019t want to help with homework, didn\u2019t want to listen when we needed advice, etc. Our dad did 95% of the emotional labor. I later found out from my mom that my dad was the one who wanted kids. She loved her career and didn\u2019t mind providing financially but she did not want to do any of the stuff related to raising us outside of that. I am very grateful she provided for us financially, but I do admit it hurts that she wasn\u2019t there when we needed her. She was physically present but not emotionally present. EDIT: as this has come up, to be clear, the arrangement was my mother\u2019s idea, not my father\u2019s. That being said, I do agree that my father was equally as selfish for making this arrangement.  My dad always did grand gestures for her. Mother\u2019s Day was always a big deal with a huge brunch, flowers, gifts. She was spoiled. She did nothing for him on Father\u2019s Day. He had to do everything for himself until my sister and I were old enough to do stuff for him. I get that was the arrangement they had but I know it made my dad sad. I once asked why he didn\u2019t get the same hoopla our mom got and he just sadly said \u201cfather\u2019s day isn\u2019t as important as Mother\u2019s Day.\u201d As adults, my sister and I have tried to rectify it. We do Father\u2019s Day up big and our dad loves it. We grill for him just how he taught us and throw a huge BBQ with some other family members. However, we\u2019ve turned Mother\u2019s Day very lowkey. We still celebrate our mom but she usually gets a quiet lunch at a restaurant of her choice and a few gifts. After my mom ended up skipping my sister\u2019s baby shower this year because \u201cshe didn\u2019t see the big deal with someone having a baby\u201d, my sister wanted to do nothing for her. We sent gifts but spent Mother\u2019s Day with each other, our husbands and our own kids.  My mom told us after Father\u2019s Day that she was hurt we didn\u2019t do more for her in recent years. I said that since she put in almost no emotional labor into raising us, we are putting none into her. She said that our father and I had an agreement. I pointed out that yes, but we never agreed to it and it want fair that we grew up with an emotionally absent mother who didn\u2019t want us.  And to be fair, we have had this conversation with our dad as well and he admits it wasn\u2019t fair to us either. I also said if she didn\u2019t want kids, then why should she be celebrated as a mom? My mom is upset with both of us and called us ungrateful brats. My dad feels bad for her but supports our choice. AITA?  EDIT: To those asking how I\u2019d feel if my dad were the one that acted like this/how I feel about dads who do this in general: they suck just as much and it\u2019s not fair to the kids, regardless of whatever agreement spouses come to. This is not gender specific. While some people may have a gender bias, I do not. ",

        "selftext": "My mom, her husband and I (16f) are in group therapy with each other. We started therapy a few weeks after Father's Day, because that was the final straw for them to insist we all needed therapy to work on why I won't let us be the family they want. We started at the end of July and by the end of August my mom accused me of lying, called me a liar and laid out this really big sob story about how much it hurt to have me lie to her and do everything in my power to destroy her marriage. It pissed me off so bad. I didn't lie at any point of this. I said as much in the follow up session and the therapist asked me to outline my side and how I felt having mom call me a liar. My mom kept trying to interrupt me, she told the therapist the shut up and she accused me of being a vicious liar then. To give some explanation about the situation. My mom and her husband got married 3 years ago. They moved in together 2 months before. Before moving in they sat me down and asked me if I was okay with us moving in together and making a family of three again. Mom brought up how we'd have a man around the house again (my dad died) and how good it would be for her to have a husband and for me to have a dad and he said he couldn't wait to be my dad and he always wanted to be a dad. He said he already had plans for us for Father's Day. This was February of three years ago. I told them I wasn't okay with that stuff. That I didn't want another dad, wouldn't let him be my dad, and was not about to spend Father's Day celebrating someone who isn't dad. They started laughing and proceeded as normal but Father's Day became a struggle because I have not spent the day with him the last three years and he has tried, so has my mom. I meant what I said. I never called him dad or let him fill the role in my life. This year he snapped and he had a temper tantrum and said I was supposed to be with him on Father's Day and not spending the day alone and he didn't sign up to be nothing to me. My mom called me a liar because she said I promised to develop a close relationship with her husband and that I said yes to wanting what they asked. She said I had said I would give him Father's Day and I lied and I have not followed through on any of it. She said I made them think I would be a willing participant and I wanted us to be a family. It pisses me off because I never said what she claims and I even repeated what I had said back then.  The therapist couldn't get mom to apologize and she has no control over the sessions where my mom and her husband dominate. So I'm totally silent and I zone out. They only realized this two weeks ago. They called me on it and I spoke up again after more than a month of no talking in therapy, to confirm I wasn't listening and it came up last week and I said I was done engaging because I was owed an apology for being called a liar. My mom and her husband are pissed that I'm wasting everyone's time letting therapy happen.  AITA?",

I also don't allow eating in the car, so we stop at places to eat. We had to go out and do some errands. I told her to grab something to eat before hand but she said she wasn't hungry. We go on our errands and halfway through she wants to stop by Wendy's. I pull in and tell her to go order I will get a seat. She comes back a few minutes later and tells me she can't order. She doesn't want to talk to the cashier at the front of the store. I told her she needs to order and we will head out. She asked me to order and I told her no. We sit for about 10 minutes when I tell her it's time to go. She in short is pissed and my wife is also upset I didn't order for her.

        "selftext": "My parents have four kids already. Me (17M), my younger sister (13F), younger brother (12M) and youngest sister (10F). My parents have relied on me heavily to take care of my siblings. Started when I was still too young to do much but they'd put them in my room if a nightmare happened and after each sibling was 6 months old they started sharing a room with me until they were 3. Then it was getting me to prepare something to eat for my younger siblings. It was also staying home with them while mom went shopping and over time it evolved. I help with homework, I make sure they're awake for school, I walk them to school since I don't have a car, I feed them and most of the time I'm the one they come to if they need help with something. My parents will drop them off at birthday parties or to friends houses. They'll take us out for family experiences but admittedly expect me to keep an eye on my siblings. My parents provide the food and house and clothes. I provide the emotional stuff. I don't love doing it but I got so used to it that it became second nature. I'm still the person my youngest sister comes to if she has a nightmare or is afraid of anything during the night. My parents learned they were pregnant again in February. They told me and my siblings last month. It was very much talked about like I will have the baby with me, in my room, for the jump and should learn how to independently change diapers and stuff. I made it clear from the jump that I wasn't raising their next kid for them. I told them I had more responsibility to my three siblings than I should've ever had. But I wasn't going to skip my own life to raise an infant from the start. My parents were shocked. They tried to get one of my younger siblings on board but they said no way, they didn't want to be responsible like me. My parents returned to me with the topic and asked what the fuck they're meant to do and they never expected me to reject a sibling like this. I said I reject child raising another one of *their* kids. Not a sibling. But also, I'll be out of the house in 7 months. I won't be around the new sibling as much and the relationship might not be the same. I told them I don't want the same relationship either. I don't want to be a parent to another sibling. They made it pretty clear they don't want to do the actual child raising and they're living a nightmare over this. When the topic came up during the last week I told them they need to place the baby for adoption since they won't have a good childhood with nobody wanting to raise them. I told my parents it would be the kindest thing to do if they refuse to raise the baby themselves. My parents accused me of treating adoption flippantly and they were sorta outraged I would rather they place the baby for adoption than for me to step up and raise this one too. AITA?",

        "selftext": "I 25F am an electrician. I started my apprenticeship at 17 and was hired immediately by my sponsor after I received my license. The reason I chose a trade was that I grew up in a trailer with my mom and sister, and I have wanted to own a house since I can remember, and being in the trades gave me access to a stable job and access to more money sooner. My partner, 29F, Thea, is a plumber, and we have scrounged and saved. In the end we bought land and built a tiny house in the uptown area of our city. It has two bedrooms and one bathroom, one of the bedrooms is our reptile room, as I keep snakes and Thea keeps bearded dragons. We are child-free and happy in our home. My Sister Lucy 34F, is a waitress and has three kids (M4, M3, M2). Her husband just left her for a woman my age and she is left without his income to raise all three kids on her own. Her husband bought out her half of the house during the divorce and that left her and the kids living with my mom in the trailer. I can admit I didn't grow up in the safest of areas and was carrying a knife when I was a teenager because of the danger. Because of the safety issue, Lucy came to Thea and I and begged us to let her and her sons move in. She said we would have to get rid of our reptiles or keep them in our room, her sons could have the other bedroom, and she would sleep in our kitchen on an air mattress. She said nothing about paying us rent or helping around the house. I told her no, because two toddlers and a little kid who is about to start kindergarten aren't suitable to be in our home and we don't want too many people in our house. She said that we live in a better part of town with better schools and that she needed the help. I told her we didn't have the room and that I was sorry, but I could hook her up with some journeymen I know and she could get started on an apprenticeship that pays better than her current job if she needed extra money. She called my job and Thea's job Dirty blue collar trash and left our home. She posted about how we wouldn't let her stay online, and now my relatives are messaging me about, How could I let a single mother and 3 kids be homeless, How they're your blood, and You owe your sister better than that. I feel like a complete asshole even though Thea told me I have every right not to want them in our house. AITA?   AFTER DINNER WITH MY XBIL EDIT: Thea and I went to dinner with my XBIL tonight. He brought his laptop and showed us all of the documentation.  1.) Lucy used her proceeds from the house to pay for her attorney, even though my XBIL offered to pay (timestamped e-mails to prove it)  2.) The woman living with him is his niece, not his AP, as Lucy claimed. (She came to the meeting; they have pictures and phone records showing that she is my XBIL's older sister's daughter.)  3.) LUCY CHEATED: ALL 3 BOYS AREN'T HIS. And DNA tests show that they all have different dads. So Lucy has been having multiple affairs.   4.) The 300 he is sending each month is a good will payment for allowing him to be a dad for a few years.   5.) Lucy isn't waitressing, she is working for Amway and another company called Sentsy in direct sales.  6.) Lucy won't do an apprenticeship because it doesn't fall under traditional gender roles (posts on a second social media account)  7.) Lucy has made homophobic posts on social media about me and my wife, and blocked us so we didn't see them. In the end... IDK what to think. ",

My ex and I were married for 12 years, and have been divorced for 5 years, we have three kids together who are now teenagers. My ex and I got divorced because we were young when we met and got married and we grew apart as people. It was a mutual decision, and we agreed our kids came first and have always coparented very well. This has been the case up until the last year when his girlfriend moved in with him. Previously we would do holidays and kids birthdays together, now when she is present they won\u2019t even sit near me at our kids sporting events. I have always been nice to this women, despite my kids expressing they do not like her and they feel their dad acts differently when she is around. My ex told me early on she wasn\u2019t a fan of me and felt I intimidated her. When I asked him for examples of how intimidated her, he said it\u2019s my fave, that I have resting bitch face and it makes her uncomfortable. My ex and her got engaged over Christmas and my kids were less than thrilled, my daughter especially. She feels her dad made a major life decision without even talking to them about it first. My ex called me yesterday saying he is giving me a heads up that I have a year to change my last name back to my maiden name as his finance is expressing her distaste and concern for her and I to have the same last name when they get married. I told him we agreed in our divorce that I could keep his last name until I felt the need to change it, and that is what is listed in our paperwork. I also told him I don\u2019t want to have a different last name than our kids. He said I\u2019m being unreasonable and refusing to see how this would make his finance uncomfortable. I told him I can\u2019t see it from her side because I am a grown up, and not an immature child like she is. He told me I could ask anyone about this situation, and everyone would agree with her. So, AITAH for refusing to change my last name to make her happy? ",

        "selftext": "My (33F) daughter \u201cCleo\u201d (5yo) hates pink. She has disliked the color and almost everything to do with it since she was about three or so. She has one pink shirt she likes and one pink stuffed animal, and that\u2019s it. My father\u2019s partner, \u201cPrue,\u201d refuses to accept that Cleo doesn\u2019t like pink. Over the years, she\u2019s made several attempts to push the color onto her (pretty much every gift she\u2019s ever given her was some shade of pink), no matter how many times I tell her to stop. She has tried to give me dozens of different reasons why I should encourage my daughter to \u201ctry different shades.\u201d It clearly upsets Cleo, but Prue keeps doing it. About a week ago, my father invited me, my husband and our children for dinner at his place. He said he and Prue had a surprise for the kids. Right before we left home, my younger sister (who still lives with our father) texted me. She warned me that the \u201csurprise\u201d was actually a small birthday party Prue had planned for Cleo. That alone threw me off, because my daughter\u2019s birthday was in November. My father did miss her actual birthday party due to work, but still. Also, my son turns 9 in March, so I had figured his would be the next party we\u2019d have. Then she sent me photos of how the place was decorated, and it very clearly wasn\u2019t actually meant for Cleo. Literally every piece of decor was pink. The table, the tableware, the balloons, everything. She had gotten pink banners and glued pink foil fringe curtains on the doors. Even the cake was pink. I showed everything to my husband, and we agreed not to take the kids there. I texted my father the following: \u201cHey, (sister) told me everything. We\u2019re not coming. We\u2019re taking the kids to McDonalds and telling them that was your surprise. You and Prue can come if you want, we\u2019re paying.\u201d We did exactly that. My father did show up (without Prue), but he was cold with us and left 20 minutes after arriving. Both him and Prue are pissed. My father is angry that my husband and I dismissed his partner\u2019s \u201cheartfelt gesture\u201d towards our daughter. Prue also told me that I\u2019m the reason Cleo is \u201crestrictive\u201d (I also don\u2019t like pink), and I\u2019m raising her to be an ungrateful, spoiled brat who is unwilling to compromise. To be honest, I get how I could be in the wrong here. But at the same time, this just felt like Prue trying to push something Cleo doesn\u2019t like onto her yet again. My sister and one of my brothers are on my side (though my sister did say I had been rude). My other brother is on the fence. AITA? EDIT: My daughter doesn't know I dislike pink, nor would I care if she did like it. EDIT: I have written an update, as well as a separate post to sum up the comments I left here.",

        "selftext": "I (35F) met my husband Vince (36M) after he saved me from drowning at a pool party when I was 18. I took him out for lunch the following week to thank him for saving me, and we soon fell in love and began dating.  At the time, Vince worked a blue collar job while I was studying in university. We ended up getting married and Vince supported me throughout my entire education up until I got my PhD.  Vince always told me that he wanted to study in university but had learning disabilities that made it difficult for him to study in a classroom. At times he was embarrassed by the fact that he had to work twice as hard compared to people around him, but I always found that to be admirable about him.  When I finished my studies and got a well paying job I convinced Vince to give his dream of studying another go.  Last year he was finally accepted into a nursing program at our local university. He is working hard to achieve him dream and I\u2019m incredibly proud of him. Last week my friend Alba (36F) came to visit with her son so our children could play together. Alba was my roommate during my first year in university, she began dating her husband Leo around the same time I started dating Vince.  Leo was an obnoxious law student who later on became an even more obnoxious attorney. He was a know it all who prided himself on his intelligence, which for some reason attracted Alba.  At the time Alba would sometimes tease me that I could do better than Vince, and would offer to set me up with one of Leo\u2019s law school buddies, but I would always refuse and she eventually dropped the subject.  Alba and Leo are currently going through a nasty divorce that stems from him cheating on her, quite frankly he is dragging her through the mud and is using connections to try and leave her as penniless as possible.  As we were chatting and catching up Alba began to express concern over the fact that my eldest son (7M) was recently diagnosed with dyslexia, Alba began telling me how she is worried that my son will be academically challenged like his father and what that could entail for his future. Before I could respond she told me how I should have married someone smart while I had the chance so I would have kids like hers. (Albas son is an incredibly bright boy and a straight A student). I told Alba her advice was unnecessary and reminded her where marrying for intelligence got her, I then proceeded to tell her that I would rather have my son grow up to be an honest, hardworking person like his father than an academically gifted jerk who wasn\u2019t smart enough to know sleeping with his secretary could have consequences on his marriage like her husband.  Alba was deeply hurt by what I\u2019ve said and stormed out with her son. Some mutual friends are now chiming in and are telling me thatI was too harsh on Alba for using her failing marriage to prove my point and should apologize.  ___________ Small update: first of all I want to thank you all for your replies :)  I wanted to address a couple of things, many of you asked why Alba and I remained friends despite her previous remarks. Alba and I grew apart during our third year in university, we only remained friends by association since we have a lot of shared mutual friends.  We became close again after our sons started playing basketball together at the local community center and became friends. I figured that becoming a mother made her more mature and she didn\u2019t give me any reason to suspect otherwise.  I\u2019ve decided to send her a message saying that the way she spoke about my husband and son was unacceptable and therefore she is no longer welcomed in my home, however, I don\u2019t want our sons to lose their friendship and therefore I\u2019m willing to remain civil around the kids and still organize play dates. She didn\u2019t reply to me just yet, but I truly hope she loves her son enough to put her ego aside and remain civil for the sake of our kids. I\u2019ve yet to notify Vince about this entire situation since he is vigorously studying for an important quiz that\u2019s coming up next week, and I know that if he heard what Alba said about him and our boy it would make him upset and he won\u2019t be able to continue studying properly. Unless something crazy happens in the meantime I\u2019ll probably update him next week after he\u2019s done with the quiz. ",

The areas school district has a Facebook account that parents are a part of. I introduced myself on there a while ago. We put katty on the cross country team and she has been making friends over the summer. I got a message from a parent last week, asking to met up and let the kids met. They would be in the same grade and I thought it would be a good opportunity.  We went yesterday at the local pool. I met Melanie and she wouldn\u2019t make eye contact, was very soft spoken and overall didn\u2019t seem to be paying attention. The kids were playing while I talked to the mom. She has always been in the area and was excited her kid was getting a friend.  Katty came up to me asking to leave since she wasn\u2019t feeling well. We left early and in the car she admitted to just wanting to get away from Melanie. She explained that    Melanie freaked her out. She was very touchy, kept pushing her in the water, was whispering ( saying things under her breath), would stare at people and make comments (comparing people to bugs? I am still confused on what that means) Katty told me she was uncomfortable and doesn\u2019t want to hang out with her again. The parent messaged me, and asked when they could do it again. I told her the girls didn\u2019t mesh well and that we will have to decline. She then called me asking what I meant. I told her that katty wasn\u2019t interested in hanging out since they don\u2019t mesh together. I was trying to be polite about it. This went on for a while and she told me that they kids just needed to be around eachother more. I told her no to that. It\u2019s went on for a while, she asked to talk to my husband which is when I snapped. I told her, no and that I was trying to be polite but your kid is weird. Melanie makes my kid uncomfortable and I don\u2019t know what the hell is up with her but we will not have another play date. She went on Facebook and it going around about how the new family are jerks. It seems to not be going anywhere, but I am wondering if I was a dick",

She thinks we should offer some other options to her kid because he has a disability.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s fair and I told her it\u2019s extremely rude to ask people who are giving out free stuff for Halloween to change things for just one kid and I told her I\u2019m not doing it.  When her child comes and knocks on my door he gets chips like everyone else.  I let the kids pick the types of chips from the bowl that they like and I feel like that\u2019s more than generous.  Debbie said other neighbors are accommodating, her child disability for Halloween and I should think of others.  I\u2019m older so I think a child should be grateful for whatever they get for free on Halloween and not expect special treatment for a disability when getting free items.  Edit: My wife and I decided we don't want to deal with it anymore and will be donating the chips to the local school and churches for their Halloween party. Lights off at our house. ",

Back when I was in my twenties our great grandmother ended up with an illness which required someone to take care of her. This ended up being me as everyone else was busy with their lives and I have only recently graduated from uni back then. Due to this when she passed away I have inherited the house she lived in, which is a small 2 bedroom. I have lived there until I got married and me and my husband ended up moving to a bigger property. About a year later my brother asked if I'm willing to rent it out to him, which I agreed to do, but have warned him I will need it back when Caroline turns 18 (She was 3 at the time) since it is very close to universities and city center. Legal agreement was drafted for the rent (significantly below market value) so everything was followed by the book. About a year ago I have informed my brother about needing the house back as my daughter is going to be 18 and I would like to have some repairs done before she moves in. My brother ignored me, so I have issued him notice to vacate, which was also ignored. As he continued to ignore me, I had no choice but apply for a court order to evict them, with hearing taking place last month. Last week him and his family were officially evicted. Upon getting into the house I have noticed it wad in horrible condition and it would take a few months just to make it somewhat habitable, let alone do redecorating or repairs. I have raised this with my brother since he was meant to look after the house and let me know of any repairs, but this talk ended up in an argument where I was called an asshole for evicting him and his family so my spoiled daughter can live by herself and not giving them enough notice (they had just over a year to find something suitable). He also said I have inherited the house by cheating. My parents are on his side since Adam and his family live with them.",

When we were discharged, the hospital sent us home with a \u201cbaby box.\u201d It was a cute little box that can double as a bed and came with a mattress, some baby clothes and other essentials. This caught me off guard because I live in the US. I thought this was only a thing in Finland. Turns out, the county I live in works with a charity that provides these boxes for all expecting moms.  I was pretty stoked about this, so I made a post on Instagram showing it off.  My stepmom messaged me and told me I should take down the post a few days later. She said it was in bad taste because a lot of new moms don\u2019t get this perk. She pointed out that her daughter, my stepsister, has been very upset by this. My stepsister did reach out, but her response was something like, \u201cwow, I had my son, all the hospital sent me was some maxi pads and a bill. :angryfaceemoji:\u201d I didn\u2019t down the post because I want to highlight the work that charity was doing. Especially for women in my area who may not be aware of the baby boxes and could really need it. My stepsister sent me a DM telling me to take the post down. She said it\u2019s unfair she has to struggle with a special needs baby while the other moms can gloat about how being a new mom is awesome. She said that she never got a free box or clothes or perfume like my cousin and everyone stopped caring one she had her son while me, my cousin and all our other relatives \u201cget all the attention.\u201d  Right now, I\u2019m leaning towards keeping the post up.

Two years after that we met, fell in love, got married, and had a kid. Unfortunately for me our son's birth was a catalyst for a regression for her.  He could do no wrong. If I tried to punish or even just correct him she would get upset and start crying or fight with me.  If he found something difficult and I wanted him to work through it or try harder she would step in and tell me to back off or actually just do it for him.  This lead to our divorce a I wanted to be a father and not a spectator. She fought so I wouldn't get custody. I ended up with visitation. My kid wouldn't do anything though. He wouldn't bring his homework over and all he wanted to do was play video games. If I didn't let him he had tantrums. It was exhausting. And she would always back him up. It was always my fault.  I remarried to my wife Diane. We have two children and are doing our best to raise them right. My son stopped coming over when he was 14. I still invite him but he rarely responds.  My child support just stopped. His mom has been giving it to him to do whatever he wanted for the last three years. Not my problem.  He called me to see if I could help him with money. I asked what for. He said that his mom can't give him the allowance he is used to. I asked if he was going to be attending some sort of post secondary school. He said no.  I told him to get a job.  His mom has lost her shit. She said she will take me back to court so her poor baby can live his life his way. I wished for the odds to be ever in her favor and hung up. Now that he is an adult I never have to talk to her again. It's too bad because I loved her very much. Not any more.  My son asked me to help him find a job. I said I would. I told him to send me his resume. I've been waiting three weeks for it. He called me yesterday to see if I had made any progress on finding him a job. I said he never sent me his resume. He got upset that I hadn't reminded him. It was one thing.  I told him that I was not going to motivate him to do anything, that I would be here if he needed help but that it would never be money again.  I let him come over and helped him with a resume. I also talked to him about the trades or a community college. He is beginning to understand how fucked his future is now that his mom cannot do everything for him. He is upset with his mother now because he doesn't have life skills.  She is mad at me for showing him the truth.  ",

I can\u2019t drive so I ran up the lane to call 999 it took forever to get signal and then it took forever for the ambulance to get to the house. I almost had to deliver the baby for fucks sake, she ended up giving birth in huge back of an ambulance. This whole time my brother had just disappeared. He finally turned up at the hospital about 8 bf hours after he disappeared. Apparently he\u2019d gone to our dad\u2019s house until our found out my sil gave birth and made my brother go see her.  I yelled at him outside the hospital for being so fucking stupid. He told me that he just got scared and didn\u2019t  know what to do. I told him that he\u2019s going to a shit dad if he keeps reacting like this. What\u2019s he gonna do when the kid gets injured and it\u2019s his responsibility to take him to A&E? Is he just gonna dump the kid and run off to dads again? He\u2019s such an idiot fucking hell. He started crying and called me a twat for being so mean to him. I just lost it with him, he was acting like a child when he should be comforting is fucking wife and apologising to her for being a dick. He called me a cunt and told me that I don\u2019t understand what he\u2019s feeling. I get that he was scared but he seriously needs to get a grip and help his wife. AITA?",

My husband and I are still working and will probably retire in 10-15 years. Around 70. My DIL and I got along much better before the kids came into the picture. They live 30 minutes away and she is always trying to drop them off. I thought my son was in on this but no. I sat them down and he had no idea this was happening. I showed the many texts asking for me to babysit and he was under the impression that I have only babysat twice this month not 16 times. Apparently she has been dropping them off with me to hangout with people and my son wa sunder the impression she was taking them with her I started to communicate in a group chat with them so everyone was on the same page. I only respond to her in the group chat and if she starts to spam me with texts about it I throw a screenshot in the group chat and have my son deal with it. We have talked and it comes down with her wanting her kids to have the same relationship she had with her grandparents. In short I explained that I am still working and I will not have that relationship. That I can\u2019t have the kids every other day just like she had growing up. We agreed to every two week to have a grandma day. All good for about a year, my son is now traveling for work and she is at it again. The time difference makes it hard to have him shut it down when I happens I was home for about an hour when she showed up at my home. She wanted me to babysit when she went shopping. I had enough at this point I told her for fucks sake I have my own life, that I will not be the cookie cutter grandma she wants and if she tries to leave the kids with me from now on without my agreement that I will call the police for abandonment. She called me a jerk and stormed off. My son called trying to smooth it over and saying I may have gone to far. Edit: for everyone going on about how he couldn't know, doesn't he talk to his kids The kids were 4 months and 1 3/4 years old when she kept dropping them off. They weren't really talking, the oldest sure could move but not a big talker  It really hit off when she was pregnant and got even worse when the second one was born ",

It takes about 20 minutes to drive to the restaurant so I planned to leave the house at 6:30pm to build in time for traffic and picking up my father. My husband (43 M) had decided to do a bit of work on his car about half an hour before we needed to leave. At 6:30 when the kids and I were waiting by the door, he was still doing it. He hadn't changed and hadn't showered. I told him to quickly get ready, but it got to 6:50 and he still wasn't ready yet so I decided to just leave without him. He has a habit of always running late when we go out and he is always the last one to be ready. Normally I can tolerate it since it only sets things back by ten minutes at the most, but my birthday dinner was important to me and I had been looking forward to it for weeks. Making us wait for 20 minutes was taking the mick, so I yelled out that we were leaving and left, because I didn't want to lose the table, since we would have arrived about 7:20. I called the restaurant to let them know we would be late and we luckily still had our table, but my husband didn't show up at the restaurant and when we got home he was mad at me. I told him that I was tired of him not respecting my time and always making people wait for him, and that he could have made his own way to the restaurant. My father agreed with my decision to leave without him, but my kids were a little upset that he wasn't there to have dinner with us. So, AITA?",

        "selftext": "So, my husband (38M) and I (36F) are expecting our first child, a bouncing baby girl due in a few months. We were both over the moon when we found out the gender, but now things have gotten . . . complicated, to say the least. See, when we first started talking about names, the \u201cboy name\u201d was immediately decided: Stuart Jr., after my husband. No problem there, it\u2019s a classic name and carries family meaning. But, for a girl, things got murky. My husband suggested Stuarta. No, you\u2019re not having a stroke. Apparently, his logic is that since Stuart ends in \u201ct,\u201d we can just add an \u201ca\u201d to make it feminine. I tried explaining why that doesn\u2019t quite work, how it sounds more like a furniture brand than a human name, how she\u2019d be endlessly correcting people and explaining its origin. He\u2019s adamant though, says it \u201chonors\u201d him while giving our daughter a unique name. I\u2019ve suggested alternatives: feminine names that maybe share a similar sound or meaning to Stuart, names he\u2019s mentioned liking in the past, even just going back to the drawing board entirely. But he\u2019s fixated on Stuarta. Now, I love my husband dearly, and I understand wanting to honor family. But I can\u2019t imagine subjecting our daughter to a lifetime of awkward stares and endless questions about her \u201cunusual\u201d name. I also worry about potential bullying and the impact it could have on her self-esteem. So, Reddit, am I the jerk for refusing to budge on Stuarta? Is there any compromise I haven\u2019t considered? Help a soon-to-be mama out! TL;DR: Husband wants to name our daughter after himself; in a really, really bad way. I think it\u2019s terrible and will set her up for a lifetime of awkwardness. AITA? Looking forward to your thoughts and (hopefully) some sanity checks! Edit: Please, no suggestions for other \u201c-ta\u201d names. The man clearly has a theme, and I need to gently steer him away from it, not fuel the fire!",

        "selftext": "I'm a single mom with a 4 year old daughter, Anna. Anna and I live with my mom. We both work and Anna goes to daycare full time. Daycare would be about half my income so I get a subsidy that covers $1400 out of her $2000 tuition. The only condition of the subsidy is that she actually has to show up. If she misses too many days I lose the subsidy. I go to work at 7:30 and daycare opens at 8 so my mom would be the one to take Anna to daycare.  Anna's main teacher is a 20/21 year old girl. When I've talked to her she's always been very animated and energetic. She's great with the kids. Anna always comes home saying this teacher brought stickers, she brought juice, she brought bubbles, she did face painting, etc. and always has fun crafts that she did with her teacher. This teacher is her favorite person in the world right now and Anna often runs away from my mom to jump on this teacher in the mornings and hides when my mom picks her up because she doesn't want to leave this teacher. My mom started to get jealous that Anna likes the teacher better than her so she started keeping her home from daycare on her days off/when she only has 1-2 easy clients (she cleans houses).  I found out Anna missed 5 days over the past 3 weeks. I asked my mom about it and she told me she wanted Anna to spend more time with family instead of with teachers I told my mom Anna needs to be in daycare unless she's sick or I would lose the subsidy. She was arguing that if Anna needs to be in daycare, she should be in one with more family values and not some rich white girl trying to save the poor kids (the teacher is a girl from a well off family marrying into a well off family and the daycare isn't in the most well off neighborhood.) She has bins full of clothes for the kids, gave everyone a water bottle with their name on it, has a much nicer classroom than the other teachers, and drives a car worth more than my mom and I combined could make in a year. She's setting up a field trip to the local airport so her fiance can talk to the kids about flying planes and so they can look at his jet. I told her I wouldn't. This is the best daycare that takes this subsidy and I won't be moving her just because she's jealous.  She was still insisting on Anna either being with family or being in a more family based daycare so I got her a babysitter. I drop her off to my neighbor at 7:30 when I leave for work and she drops Anna off at 8:15 on her way to take her kids to school. She only charges me $10 a day. I don't love the breakfasts that she gives Anna but I know she's going to daycare and I won't lose the subsidy.  Now my mom is pissed that I'm keeping Anna away from her.

Luke knows I\u2019ve been vegan since my 20s and it\u2019s never been an issue before. When I asked where he made reservations he said a local BBQ place that is famous here for having a menu that mocks people who don\u2019t eat meat, like literally has a section that says \u201cVegetarian options: don\u2019t let the door hit you on your way out\u201d. I asked what he expected me to eat, and he got huffy and said well it\u2019s his birthday so it shouldn\u2019t matter, I should eat before getting there and just order drinks while everyone else eats dinner and still enjoy everyone\u2019s company etc.  This sounds miserable to me. I had zero expectations of Luke picking somewhere vegan friendly, hell I expected him to pick a steak house and I would\u2019ve been fine with a salad and some sides, I didn\u2019t expect him to choose somewhere that prides themselves on meat being in every single dish on the menu.

I REALLY love their cheesecake (this becomes important later) Well everything was going fine and we were having a good time until an elderly man at the next table scooted his chair out just as our server was approaching, causing him to stumble and spill hot coffee on me( down my back). It was obviously burning and startled me so I instinctively screamed and pulled my shirt up.  I\u2019m pretty small chested so I don\u2019t typically wear a bra and obviously I wasn\u2019t thinking about that when something hot was running down my back burning me so I basically flashed all those at the tables around us. Yes I was embarrassed but at the same time it\u2019s just boobs. I pulled my shirt back down right after realizing what happened but it was up for about 15 seconds. The server apologized over and over but it wasn\u2019t their fault it was all just an accident.  Well anyway after this my bf wanted to leave, like immediately leave. He said that I was being overdramatic for the way I reacted in the situation and maybe I was but it did startle me really bad and it did burn. He told me I had put on a show for everyone in the restaurant especially since I screamed when it happened and that we need to leave.  I told him it\u2019s not that big a deal and that I really want to stay to get cheesecake because it\u2019s my favorite, I eventually even offered to try to get some to go and he was dead set that we need to leave and didn\u2019t understand why I wasn\u2019t mortified.  We ended up staying but for the rest of the date he kept saying that the men at tables near us were staring at me and probably thinking about me inappropriately but I said it wasn\u2019t my problem if they\u2019re being gross.  When we got in the car he told me i ruined our anniversary for making him sit through that and we should have just left and that he can\u2019t believe I would choose a piece of cheesecake over his comfortability.

        "selftext": "My older brother Jamie died 7 months ago. He was 20. Before he died he wrote a letter for me and another for our dad. His letter to me was him apologizing for leaving, saying he loved me, he wanted me to have a good life and things like that. Dad's letter was different. Jamie told dad we always knew he cheated on our mom, that he was disgusted to be his son, that he didn't tell him he was sick because he didn't want dad to fake grieve him like he did our mom, he didn't want dad's tears or anguish, that he felt like dad not getting the chance to say goodbye was justice for his affair, his affair child and for the hell he put the two of us through when we were so young and losing our mom. I only know the content of dad's letter because he told me about it and wanted to know if I felt similar in any way and I told him I did. My dad had other kids with his wife, the affair partner (or one of them?). My half sisters are 11 and 10 and my half brother is 8. I'm 17M because I know I didn't mention that. And the timeline was mom was sick for like a year. She died when I was 5 and my brother was 8. Dad was a dad again only 6 months after she died and his wife was living with us before that point. Dad never explained it to us. He relied on us being young, and boys, and not knowing enough about pregnancy to realize. My brother always kept his distance from our half siblings and he wanted no part of being their brother. I feel similarly but I'll try to be nice because we live in the same house. But now that Jamie's gone I feel like I lost my only sibling and I don't love or care about my half siblings or think of them as real siblings. Which might be why I'm resisting here but anyway. Dad knows I have a letter from Jamie. But Jamie didn't write anything to our half siblings. So dad wants to make a copy of the letter and make it look like it's to all of us (so edit it). He said ever since the girls found out I got one, they've been upset and they grieve for Jamie too and they don't deserve the weight of being unloved by their brother and knowing they'll never get to have a kind message from Jamie. He said Jamie never said I love you to them or hugged them or gave them any of his heart. And it's not their fault. But some of the pain can be eased if they think he thought of them. He said we'll just say I was being possessive of the letter and it was never just mine. I didn't agree to share the letter and I told dad I don't want him to edit it. He got really mad at me and asked me how I can have such a small age gap between me and my half sister, how I could live with them for 11 years and not want to save them from this. He asked me if I had become such a monster. AITA?",

She said it was all under the table and that she needed money.  This was when I said that I would be taking the keys to my area back from my parents and I was also going to change the locks. I said that I agreed to let my parents live with me to help them out. They agreed to let her move in because she is an irresponsible wench that can't understand birth control. I never agreed to let her use my house as a day home. I know I do not want three kids here along with four adults. Well three adults and a pregnant dumbass. (I thought this but did not say it)  My mom is mad that I am going to lock them out of my area but my dad understands. The thing is I would let him keep a key but my mom would get it from him and she would give it to my sister. I said I would leave the garage lock the same and that was good enough for him.  My mom and my sister are upset and giving me the silent treatment. My mom got my dad to ask me if they paid for the insurance if my sister could watch her friend's kid. I agreed but I did say that they should get my sister to pay it. ",

        "selftext": "I rent out my house through a service that includes insurance when it is in use. The insurance does not cover when I lend my house out to friends and family since they are not paying. I have regular homeowners insurance for that.  My brother was using my house with his family just after New Year's. It's a slow time and I wasn't going to lose out on much income.  My nephew stayed up late one night and didn't go out for breakfast with his family. So he decided to make himself some food.  He started a kitchen fire. And he freaked out and called 911 instead of using the fire extinguisher in the kitchen. He is 14 so I can't blame him too much.  The smoke damage will cost about $8,700 to fix. I told my brother he could take his time paying me back. He said he wasn't going to pay for an innocent mistake.  I needed the house in order so I just fixed everything. I didn't go through insurance since I do not want my rates going up.  I was obviously upset so I posted about the fire and how pissed I was at my brother. Pretty much all my friends and family took the side of the innocent angel. They said it was unfair for me to expect that much money from him when he could have rented a hotel for 1/4 the price.  So I agreed. I said that from now on my house was off limits unless they rented it out or I was there and they came as my guests. Since I only use the house with my family that means they can rent it all or use the only empty bedroom. It has a twin bed and a crib.  Now the howling started that I'm being unfair to them for something that wasn't their fault. I offered to take up a collection from them to cover the repairs or the increased insurance premiums and most of them shut up.  I directed them all to my brother. He got quite angry at me for blaming him for the situation. I said I wasn't about to send a mob after my nephew.  I bought the house after I got a settlement from a worksite accident. I use the income to supplement the difference in what I used to earn at my old job and what I do now.  So I guess my question is am I the asshole for telling everyone who has a problem with me charging rent or stuffing a family into a room meant for two small children to talk to my brother about it.",

        "selftext": "There is a whole lot of unnecessary back story I will leave out.   I rented my parent's house after they retired and moved south. I paid slightly below market rate. The plan was for me to save up and eventually buy the house at a great price. They would then give that money to my brother as his part of their estate. My share was the subsidized rent and the very subsidized purchase agreement.  Everyone thought this was fair. Until my brother's wife started running up debts they couldn't cover.  This lead to them losing their home and needing help. I love my brother and my nephews so when my mom asked me if they could move in I talked to my husband and we agreed. We are in the process of adopting two siblings but we are still not there. It was only going to be temporary so why not.  Half off the rent for a few months would totally help us with the down payment and expenses. They moved in in February. When March rolled around I sent transferred half my usual rent to my parents. My mom called to ask me where the rest was. I said I assumed that Brad was paying the other half. Nope. I had to pay all the rent. I asked why I had to pay for them to stay in my house. My mom said it wasn't my house yet and that I was being mouthy.  I saw the writing on the wall. I paid the rent and started looking. We had a good amount saved up and we didn't need a big old house with lots of maintenance issues we had been handling.  We paid the full rent in April as well. But we moved out and into the house we closed on. It was ready for immediate possession. With my husband and I having decent income and 25% down it went smoothly. The only downside is the much smaller yard. But it is a block away from a public park so we aren't losing much.  I did tell my parents we were leaving. May first I got another call from my mom. She wanted the rent. I said I wasn't living there any more. She said I was breaking our deal. I said that our deal never included me paying for my brother's living expenses. She said  that they couldn't afford to cover the mortgage without my rent. I told her to get money from my brother. He was still working. She said he was trying to pay his debts. I said that his wife should get a job.  I could write a much longer post just on this discussion.  Long story short she said I was being cheap and viscous to my brother and to my parents.  We are settling in to our newish house and just ignoring them for a while. But I'm wondering about if maybe I'm wrong.  AITA?",

        "selftext": "I'm (16m) currently in family therapy with my dad, his wife, my sister (14) and stepsiblings (10, 9 and 7). This blended family thing is pretty new still with my dad being remarried for 2 years. My mom died so I only have one home. And I'll be honest I was never excited or really into the whole blended family thing. But I know that's not my decision. All three of my stepsiblings have food allergies, two have bad ones. So the way we eat changed a lot. This included places we eat at that were a part of traditions. For most of my life we'd eat at this local noodle bar in town for the end of the school year and whenever we had a school thing (play, graduation, report card, etc) and we're not allowed to go there anymore because of the allergies. Even just with dad it's a no go. We can't bring ice cream into the house anymore because my stepsiblings can't eat it. Only my dad and his wife can prepare food so no more making a sandwich for myself either. Birthdays have changed. My sister and I can no longer eat at our preferred restaurant of choice because of my stepsiblings and we can't bring my favorite dish into the house either. So now it's a place that my stepsiblings love and is acceptable for their allergies. For two years dad has talked about how glad we are to make all these changes and how family is worth it. About four months ago his wife noticed my sister and I weren't engaged with the family in the way she thought we'd be. We didn't want to talk to her. She also noticed my sister had cut me and her out of some photos of all of us and used just me and her for her room's art wall. So she and dad decided we needed some family therapy. Since we started about two months ago officially there has been a lot of what's the problem, why are we there, explain the problem. And my dad has also talked about all the good from a blended family and changes were mentioned and he talks about how happy we all are to make them. Well, last week I got so sick of it and the therapist asked me if I was truly okay with them. And I went off. I said no I'm not. That I hate the changes. That it's unfair. That I never said I wanted my stepsiblings to celebrate my birthday more than I wanted my favorite foods. That these things were decided for me. I said I never would have made that decision because celebrating with them isn't important to me. I'd rather have a good time with the people I love and enjoy food that I love instead. And that I hate not being able to make a sandwich or buy snacks after school. I basically went off for the whole session between a rant and answering questions the therapist put to me. My dad is so mad at me for doing it and his wife was really upset because her kids heard it. But she was also upset because she accepted on some level I didn't want this ever. She's also kinda mad that I took up a whole session with my rant. AITA?",

        "selftext": "My mom died when I (17m) was 5. My dad remarried when I was 8 and made a blended family with his wife and her two kids. Then they had two kids together so I have step and half siblings. My mom's family were a big part of my life for the first 6 years and then my dad and them fought because my dad had met his wife by then and he didn't like their reaction to the news. Essentially he wanted to invite them over for my grandparents yearly family BBQ and my grandparents didn't want to include them. They told him they couldn't accept my mom's replacement. He got mad at them for feeling that's what he was doing and he told them they could forget about seeing either of us again. He tried to keep me from them but they filed for grandparents rights and dad's lawyer said they'd win so he said I could see them once every three months for 4 hours. It was way less than I was used to but it didn't stop me being close to them. He invited them to his wedding and they didn't come. It pissed him off more and then he got super weird about it and he suddenly started demanding invites again for his wife's kids when I was invited and then when my half siblings were born, he was including them in the attempt to force my family's hands. But they never invited them. They did ask me if I wanted them there and I said not really. So they didn't change their mind. My dad always bitched about them whenever my visits would come around. He really hated that I went and my step and half siblings couldn't. He tried to tell me I should advocate for them all to be included. I never replied to him because it was easier not to. Once I turned 14 he got worse with that stuff and he'd complain that I was calling and texting them and that I kept in touch more than the once every three months. He'd tell me they hate my siblings, that he didn't want us to have our family. I told him that didn't upset me or make me mad and it didn't change that I wanted to see them. The day I went back to school (senior year) my dad told me since I was graduating in May and I'd be 18, he needed to make it clear that I will need to choose. Because I can't keep spending time with people who refuse to include most of my family and he told me I'll have to choose my family or them. I told him the them were my family and I'd choose them. He didn't expect the answer. He got pissed and told me I should always choose siblings over extended family. Then he acted like I hadn't given my answer because he told me when he and his wife throw me the graduation party that I won't be allowed to invite my mom's side. I told him he didn't need to throw me one because they would and I'd made it clear my choice will be them. Dad told me that isn't how it works. I told him it is because he gave the ultimatum and he needs to live with the consequences. He accused me of twisting his words and disrespecting him by throwing that in his face. AITA?",

        "selftext": "So I (21F) have been friends with Loreen (22F) for 17 years now and we\u2019re really close. She recently gave birth to her daughter and her and her husband recently told us the name. They decided to name their daughter Ghiuliyette (pronounced Juliet) and her middle name is Mahriya. I thought the spelling was a joke, until she told me they are serious. I told her, that with that spelling of a simple but beautiful name is just going to ruin that little girls life. She got mad and told me to stop \u201eruining\u201c her mood and that I\u2019m being mean. I\u2019m completely honest. The spelling is just bad. Nothing else can explain it. Why ruin such a beautiful name by including letters that don\u2019t belong there?  I texted her yesterday and told her that the little girl will try to change her name or at least go by her middle name since it\u2019s normal. She told me to stop texting her, that I\u2019m a bad friend and that I\u2019m being the asshole for making fun of the name. I don\u2019t think I am. When I told her that the spelling is just bad, she went crazy. She told me that I\u2019m the worst friend ever and that I would never be able to see her daughter again. After that, her husband sent me an email, telling me to stop being so disrespectful. He thinks the spelling is cute and it just makes her unique. Unique-yes. But that\u2019s just going to make that little girl suffer and she will probably be bullied for that spelling. I haven\u2019t replied and honestly I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the asshole here, but I thought I\u2019d ask Reddit since y\u2019all are the best to judge. So, am i the asshole for telling my friend that the name she gave her daughter is bad and will ruin her life? Update: Alright, I get it. I\u2019m an asshole for going after the Name more than once. Sorry for that lmao. I just send her an apology text for doing it, yet I did write how she should try to look at it from another perspective. I also send a few screenshots of the comments just for her to see what other people think of it.FYI I\u2019m supposed to be the godmother, which is why I was extra worried lmao my bad Update 2: Hello again. I\u2019ve been asked if there are any updates and yes there are!So I\u2019ve been talking with Loreen a lot (over text) and she\u2019s slowly starting to notice her \u201emistake\u201c. I apologized again and we are good again. We talked about the name and she told me that she won\u2019t change it and really loves it, but is slowly understanding why it\u2019s weird for others, especially me. Her husband on the other hand is still pretty mad at me. He thinks that I took it too far and that my apologies aren\u2019t from the heart\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. I\u2019ve been asked if I\u2019m still the godmother and yes I am. There were thoughts of changing it, but now that we get along again, I\u2019m back in the role.  Back to the husband: he actually blocked me everywhere and is telling Loreen to do so too because he thinks that I\u2019m manipulating and that I\u2019m lying just so we can get close again. Doesn\u2019t  make sense. Idk. Well either way, it\u2019s getting better with the relationship, just not with the name. ",

        "selftext": "My ex-husband (40M) and I (35F) have two children together (12,11M). We divorced about 10 years ago now because I feel like he regressed as a husband and a father during my second pregnancy and he was even worse when our younger son was born. He was acting like a high school or college kid or a single 20 something with no kids. He spent more time with friends than with us. His friends were also treating me more like his mom and expecting me to pick him up from their houses when they needed to get on with stuff. He fought for 50% custody of our kids which he wasn't given and for the first two or three years he had every other weekend and a two week period during the summer with them as well as alternating holidays. He started being more involved and eventually he did get 50% custody. It was at that time I found out he got some woman pregnant and he realized with three kids he needed to get his act together. He ended up with full custody of his third child. Then he met his wife. They have two more children together now. There are two kids in her life, but I don't believe they're her biological children anyway, who she is also partially supporting. Those two kids don't live with them but apparently she/they pay for stuff for this child. Ex and I started getting along better but then his marriage was rocky. As his marriage worsened he started treating me like a co-parent to all his kids. He'd bring his other children to custody exchanges and expecting interactions between me and his other children. Then it was requests to babysit for him and his wife, which I never did. Then it was comments about our boys old clothes at my house being sent to his house for his other kids and how *we* needed to make sure they had adequate clothing. I told him there was no we in that and he said of course there is, we're co-parents. I said of our two sure, but not his other kids. It was requests for me to have his children in my home or to take them out to eat with me and our kids. And finally it has turned into back to school craziness. I bought supplies for the boys and he told me I hadn't bought nearly enough *for everyone*. I was like hold up, what's that supposed to mean and he pointed out that what I bought wouldn't be possible to share evenly between all five children. I told him we don't have five children, we have two, the two I bought those for. I told him I am responsible for our children not his three others. I told him he has a wife, they share two of those children, the other is in their home, so it's up to them. He told me that I know they don't have a lot of money and I cut him off and told him that still didn't make his children my problem. He said I can't possibly take care of just two of them, not when we're co-parenting and all five kids live together 50% of the time. He said I should be a part of the community to help raise these kids and keeping my distance like I do is *so dang cold.* AITA?",

        "selftext": "My (18f) cousin's (22f) wedding was this weekend. I'll call her Mary. Growing up, we were pretty close, as me and my siblings (20f and 23m) often went to Mary's house. Lately, we haven't seen each other much, because all of them moved away for college, but it's still nice to see each other at family events. A year and a half ago, she met her now husband. He was invited to Christmas, Easter, and every family event since then. When he was there, I noticed that Mary was a lot more distant than usually and barely talked to me but talked with my siblings all night. I figured it was probably just because of our age difference. A few weeks/months ago, we got an invitation to their wedding in the mail. Or at least my parents did. My name wasn't mentioned on the invitation, which was addressed to The *ourlastname*s, but since I still live with my parents, and my brother and sister both got one, I assumed I was included, and so did my parents. But Mary's face dropped when she saw me. She pretended to smile but I could see something was bothering her. The wedding went on, but during the cocktail Mary came up to me and asked me why I came, since she didn't send me an invitation. I was taken aback a bit, but told her that we assumed I was included, and  asked her why she didn't invite me. She avoided the question, but after insisting a bit she told me that she wanted her husband's family to have a good impression of her family, and didn't want them to know that her cousin was a lesbian, because she wanted to have a normal family. For context, our family is pretty open minded, and all of them accept me, but her husband and his family are a lot more traditional and conservative. What I don't understand is, I don't look gay (whatever that means), and they would've never known unless someone told them. I was so shocked. I told her that she was sick for caring about impressing a bunch of bigots more than her own cousin. She got mad at me and we both got a bit loud, which attracted attention. People came to find out what was happening. When they found out, my parents said that she was being mean and shouldn't have made a big deal about this. A bunch of other people said that it was wrong of me to come when I wasn't invited. Mary started telling me to leave, so I stormed off. Since, I have been receiving texts from her and her parents saying that I was a bitch for coming, making a scene, and ruining her big day. I understand that it's her wedding and she can invite whoever she wants, but her words were so hurtful... And I genuinely thought I was invited. But I know it's wrong that I caused such a scene on her wedding day. Maybe I should've just left and not said anything? AITA?",

        "selftext": "I (16m) make my own lunch for school. I started making them when I was 11 and my mom was sick with cancer and now I make all my lunches. My dad refuses to give me lunch money for school, said no way in hell to making them (mom made his and now he pays for lunch every day) and doesn't want to give me permission to eat outside school (which is an option with parents consent) because he'd need pay for that. So I make them. I work part time and so I started paying for the ingredients I use in my lunches. My dad got married 2ish years ago. His wife has three kids who are 5, 7 and 8 now. For about a year there's been this issue where my dad and his wife want me to make all four lunches. They said if I'm making my own I should make my siblings (and I say siblings because they're not my sibling) lunches too to save their mom time and to streamline everything. I was like no and my dad's wife was shocked. She called me out for making stuff only for myself. She said it's crazy that I would look at my siblings and not want to make a few things for them too. It escalated to where they said I shouldn't get to eat their dinners if I won't participate in taking care of the family. So I buy my own dinner stuff now and make my own. Now they're calling me out for doing that. They said I could make dinner for all four of us and then we could eat dinner earlier and my dad and his wife could do something else. My dad's wife didn't make lunches for her kids on several occasions to try and make me relent. Their teachers ended up feeding them and writing to her about it. She was super pissed and asked me if I was ashamed. I told her they're her kids and her problem, not mine. I also suggested she take it up with my dad if she's unhappy and wants help feeding her kids because it's not my job. She said if dad won't feed me, he won't feed her kids. I shrugged her off. Monday was a big day in all of this. I was home for hours alone and made a nice dinner. I was eating when my dad's wife came home with her kids, who were hungry and she exploded on me and asked if I'd made the kids dinner. I said no. She demanded to make it up to them I make them lunch for Tuesday (yesterday) and I said no. She called me a bunch of names and told me she fucking hates me because I'm supposed to be a decent kid and yet I won't help feed her kids and it's not how you treat family. I told her because it's not my job and we're not a family. I pointed out she married a guy who isn't a good dad to his own kid, and how her only interactions with said kid were attempting to dump responsibility onto him (me) so she really has no reason to think I owe her anything. Which of course let her to calling me all kinds of things, including an ass. AITA?",

        "selftext": "My wife and I agreed before we got married on a lot of the big things. Where we would live. How we would deal with our families. How we would raise our kids. Stuff like that. Deal breakers.  One of our decisions was that as long as our kids were full time students then they would not have to contribute monetarily to the household budget. Obviously they would still have chores and such. If they weren't full time students then they would get a six month grace period after which they had to pay rent and buy their own food. Rent would be equal to 1/4 of full time minimum wage work.  We agreed on this in 1998.  Our eldest did not want to go to university and used the six months after graduation to work, save money, and plan a trip around the world. When he got back he started an apprenticeship and is now a welder. Our middle kid went to university and is now a nurse. Our youngest did one semester of college and decided it wasn't for him. He also decided that he didn't want to work. After six months I told him that he was now responsible for his rent and food budget. He went crying to his mom saying that he couldn't afford that. She said he didn't have to pay. She didn't discuss it with me first. It was a unilateral decision on her part.  She pays all our bills. I give her a set amount every month to pay for everything. The money she earns she either spends however she wants or it goes into our vacation fund.  So I decided to cut my contribution to our budget by the cost of rent and 1/3 of our grocery bill.  She asked me why I did that and I said that we had an agree that she chose to ignore so I did the same.  She has been paying the difference out of the money that would normally go into our vacation account and she cut back on her personal spending. But she is pissed that I am doing this. She says I'm an asshole for being financially manipulative.  I think she needs to either accept it or get her poor baby to grow up.  She tried getting our older kids on her side but they agree with me.  AITA? ",

        "selftext": "My 17 year old son was diagnosed recently with a wheat allergy. He had been battling gut issues for a few months and we finally found that he can't have wheat. I immediately went into research mode. I read labels learned all names for wheat bought hundreds of dollars of food/snacks for him to try. I took him to whole foods and organic markets for hundreds more. I bought wheat alternative flours and began cooking gluten free. He still had digestive issues. So back to dr. Only issue wheat. Come to find out he's spending his pay check at school on biscuits and gluten filled snacks. He goes to a friend's house and bam eats McDonald's and wheat filled junk. The doc and I warned him that this is only mild-moderate but it can get worse. He actually came home with urticaria and hives last weekend. He ate cake and pizza at a friend's.  He's not 10 he's 17. I can't be  with him everywhere and police every single thing he eats.He knows what wheat is and what to look for we literally learned together. The school said they won't cut him off even with a dr note cause he's old enough to police himself. Tgey provide alternatives but he won't eat them. He's stubborn. Tonight we went out to a gluten friendly restaurant and I got him a gluten free meal 26 dollars (ours average 15-18). I made sure he was good with the selction. He didn't eat it but instead snuck off others plates and snuck bread. My MIL is an enabler(just a bit won't bother him 10 bites later) He stunk up the car on the way home and tried to deny that he ate whest but the guy won't lie. He is wanting to stay home due to gut pain but I'm getting peeved cause he's causing it. Am I an awful mom that If he's going to eat what he wants that I am just over making the effort and spending way extra money when he's not even following the diet (I have been begging, trying ,and cooking GF for over 9 mos and have spent thousands trying to find what even I feel taste pretty good alternative). I don't want to be a uncaring person but I feel like I'm wasting time and money that we don't really have when it makes no difference. AITA?",

I started college two years ago, and he just graduated with a Bachelor of Biomedical Science. My husband has a girl best friend (23f), who i'll call Sam, who he met in College, both of them grew up Baptist, and while he's left the church, they had a very similar childhood and bonded quite quickly. Despite what you may be thinking her and I got along really well. She and I liked the same music and we were both studying in relatively the same fields so she became a friend of mine as well. Since I found out I was pregnant though, some issues have started to arise. We announced our pregnancy on social media after we told our parents. Sam texted my husband a congrats text and then told him to pass on her well wishes to me. She's been texting him nonstop with baby advice and what she likes to call advice for mama which includes sometimes relatively targeted jabs at what I should eat. Honestly i kept brushing the texts off, but it got a point where the conversations were less about the baby and more about me which I was getting increasingly uncomfortable with because she wasn't texting me she was texting my husband. My husband acknowledged this and has just started to show them to me and ask what I want him to do. I just told him to ignore them. When i announced I was having a baby shower and sent out the invites, I recieved a text from Sam. She said something along the lines of wanting to host my baby shower and set it up. I told her politely that my mom was planning on hosting it with the help of my sister and that it was a special moment for them and I wouldn't want to take that away. Well Sam ignored that message, because the next day, she came over and insisted we start working out arrangements for the venue. I told her once again, my mom and sister were hosting it and she told me that she should take her advice and let her plan it because she'd ensure that the baby shower would be better if she planned it particularly because she'd be working on the menu. Whether it was pregnancy hormones or just bottled up rage, i told her that the jabs she'd been making at me behind my back about my diet during this pregnancy to my husband are really annoying at that no she cannot host this shower and from now on her unsolicited advice was not appreciated especially if she can't say it to my face. That night my husband's phone blew up with messages from Sam saying that he had no right to show her those messages and they were just supposed to just be health tips because Sam was studying nutritional science and only wanted to help her best friend and ensure a happy baby and life. I know she had somewhat good intentions and she's been a good friend to my husband and to me so AITA? ***UPDATES IN COMMENTS***",

I also work out of town. I started doing that once the kids were old enough to take care of themselves with their dad at home. So when my youngest was in middle school and the oldest was a junior in high school.  It is great. Our retirement savings are piling up and we have been able to splurge on the kids. And ourselves.  My husband is upset however because I decided to pay for a cleaning lady. He and I discussed it and we agreed that him and the kids didn't do a great job keeping the house clean and tidy while I was away. I hated coming home to a mess. It caused a few fights because it was like they expected me to come home and clean up after them.  Having her is fantastic. I come home to a clean house and I am happier. My kids have more time to study and do extracurriculars. They still have chores and they are still expected to clean up after themselves.  My husband came to me last time I was home and said we should cut back on the service when I'm home. That I should be doing more housework. He thinks that we are wasting money. I said that I work 14 days in a row and that those are 13 hour days. Yes it is mostly paperwork but his job as a teacher isn't much more physically challenging. I said that I could offer him two options. If he wanted we could completely get rid of the service and him and the kids could make sure the house was in good shape when I got home. Or he could pay me my hourly rate to do extra housework when I am on my days off.  He is upset with me and sys that I'm being financially manipulative. I think if he and the kids actually did what they are supposed to do when I'm away bone of this would be an issue.",

        "selftext": "So this is a bit of a weird one. I (41M) was at a friend's birthday party on the weekend just past. There were 9 of us at the party including the birthday boy (which is surprisingly relevant). All fake names from here on out. Amy (30ish F), one of the guests, baked a cake for the birthday boy. After the relevant party traditions of singing the birthday song, and the hip-hip-hooraying that happens after the birthday song here in Australia, I went back to talking to one of my friends when Amy came up to me and the other friend with 2 plates of cake and offered them to my friend and I. We both said yes, thanked her, and then she made a really odd face and walked away. My friend and I both said it was weird, and went back to chatting. I ate some of the cake and it had desiccated coconut inside it, which I don't particularly like, so after a couple of bites, I ignored it and then chucked it out when the party ended about an hour or so later. About 45 minutes ago, Steven (30ish M), Amy's partner, sent me a series of angry texts (8am on a Monday morning is really not the best time to receive angry texts) saying how Amy spent last night crying about how she didn't get to eat any of her cake and that I took a slice of it only to throw it away and deprive her of her own cake, and that she only cut 8 slices since she knows I don't like coconut, but I took her slice and threw it away to spite her. I replied, Why did she even offer me any cake if she knew there was coconut inside? Steven said that she did it to be polite and not leave me out, and that I was an asshole for taking her slice and throwing it away. I forwarded the message to my other friends that were there, and most of them have left me on read so far, except one who responded with a thumbs down emoji, and another who hasn't seen it yet (as of this writing). The fact that no one's responding to me is making me worry that I might have been the asshole here.",

        "selftext": "The mother of my two children (10m and 9f) cheated on me during our marriage and became pregnant with another man's child. I learned this when I caught her with the man in question and after quizzing her, she admitted there was a strong chance he was the father of the baby she was pregnant with. I ended our marriage right there and took a DNA test when her youngest was born and she was not mine. So in the divorce custody and support was only factored in for our two kids. I paid some child support because I made more than her but we had 50-50 custody time with the kids and I remained an involved dad. My ex lived with her youngest's father October of last year when he took off without a word and dipped from their lives. She has been in pursuit of child support ever since but he cannot be found and he quit the last known job he had, so she has been unsuccessful so far. This has led to her struggling and I buy more for the kids we share so they don't suffer because of the failed relationship with the affair partner. Last month my ex told me she was struggling to keep up with the expenses for her youngest and she asked me if I would maybe buy some stuff that included her too. I said no, that I was responsible for my kids and I would not become financially responsible in any way for the child she made while cheating on me. She begged and told me they will have different lives if I don't help at least for now and I told her that was not my problem and maybe she'll think about that in the future before she starts an ongoing affair. She told our kids about asking me and encouraged them to ask me for them. The kids were confused because they have always known their half sister is not my child but they started to doubt because of how their mom talked (saying good men take care of all their children and loving a child who is part of your family should never be that hard). The kids approached me and asked me about it and told me their mom wanted them to ask me for stuff for their half sister. So I explained to them that she is not my child or part of my family but she is still part of theirs. They asked why since my oldest has some memories of his mom and I being together while she was pregnant. I said their mom got pregnant with their half sister while we were together but DNA proved she was not mine and I did not raise her for that reason. I told them I am still their dad and nothing has changed but I was never really their half sister's dad and don't want to buy her stuff like I do for them. They understood and when they went back to their mom's she called and cussed me out for telling the kids more details than she wanted them to know. I said they had always been aware they had a different dad to her other child and that needed to remain clear because I was not claiming her now that her father has abandoned her. She called me a cruel dick. AITA?",

The entire time they\u2019ve been married, she\u2019s been a housewife and now she\u2019s a stay at home mom with no plans to return to work. I think that\u2019s fine and have been supportive. I also know she and her husband both have sizeable life insurance policies so if god forbid, one dies, they\u2019ll be okay. However, she also signed a prenup. Which again, I think is smart. But according to my daughter, she\u2019d get a very small settlement. And even with child support, there\u2019s a good chance she\u2019d have to return to work. And after being out of the workforce for a bit, who knows if that\u2019ll be a challenge. My main worry is my niece fell into this scenario and even with child support, she struggled. So, my husband (her father) and I set up a \u201cjust in case\u201d account. If she and her husband divorce, she\u2019ll have money to fall back on just in case. If they remain married past the time my husband and I die, it\u2019ll just be added to what she\u2019ll inherit.  I didn\u2019t intend on telling her about it unless it happened but my husband pointed out that if she was ever in a situation where she wanted to leave but worried she financially couldn\u2019t, it\u2019d be good for her to know she has a Plan B. So, we told her and she was a little surprised. She said she appreciated it but felt we were \u201crooting against her\u201d. I said we love her husband and hope they have a long, healthy marriage. We have always been supportive. But this is similar to the prenup. A just in case. A last resort.  Well, she told her husband and he\u2019s pissed at us as well, saying that we don\u2019t trust him. I said it\u2019s looking out for our daughter and really is no different from the prenup. I added that just as he\u2019ll always want to protect his daughter, we\u2019ll always want to protect ours.

I agreed because I love my nieces and nephew, but I made it clear that I needed at least two weeks\u2019 notice because I work long hours, and I\u2019d have to rearrange my schedule. Fast forward to this past week. I asked my boss for time off, cleared my weekend, and stocked my house with everything the kids would need. Friday afternoon rolls around, and I\u2019m waiting for her to drop them off. Suddenly, I get a text from her saying they\u2019re not coming. She decided last minute that they were going to a family-friendly resort instead and didn\u2019t need me to watch them anymore. No apology, just, \u201cWe\u2019ll do it another time.\u201d I was frustrated because I had completely cleared my weekend, turned down plans with friends, and rearranged my work schedule for this. I responded by telling her it wasn\u2019t cool to cancel on me last minute like that, especially when I went out of my way to help. Then, two days later, she called me again asking if I could watch the kids the following weekend. Apparently, something came up with her original plan, and she needed someone to watch them after all. I told her no, I wasn\u2019t available. She got upset and said I was being selfish and punishing her kids for something that wasn\u2019t their fault. Now she\u2019s mad at me, and my parents are saying I should be more understanding because \u201cthings come up when you\u2019re a parent.\u201d I don\u2019t have kids, but I feel like it\u2019s just basic respect to not cancel on someone last minute and then expect them to be available whenever you want. So, AITA for refusing to watch my sister's kids after she canceled on me last minute? Edit: Wow, I didn\u2019t expect so many NTA responses! Thanks, everyone. I was starting to feel guilty about standing my ground, but it\u2019s good to hear that others agree it\u2019s important to set boundaries, even with family. I love my nieces and nephew, but my time is valuable too, and I\u2019m glad I\u2019m not being unreasonable here. Thanks again for all the support!",

Obviously as it was very small and I was possibly a second round invitee I didn't get a plus one. Fine with me. I ultimately decided to go. When I went to book the hotel room for my stay I found they only had large rooms available (multiple beds or king beds etc) as it's a popular wedding destination and is a bit fancy. So, I thought, why not invite my boyfriend (26M)? That way we could trade off on the long drive there and back and share the big room I would have to pay for anyways. The idea was that night we arrived we could get dinner together somewhere new and have a nice breakfast before heading back home. While I was at the wedding events he could just hang out in the hotel room or the pool or whatever. The wedding went great, but then after it wrapped up, the maid of honor (who I'm closer to than the bride) was chatting with me as I walked back to my room and I knocked on the door instead of digging through my bag for the keycard. When my boyfriend opened the door for me the MoH just greeted him and walked off. I didn't think it was a big deal or anything. A few days later the MoH reached out and said it was awkward and uncomfortable for me to have invited him to the hotel and it made 'everyone' feel bad and weird that he was there waiting for the wedding to end when they hadn't invited him.  We were both a bit surprised! No one even knew he was there because it didn\u2019t come up at all during the wedding. It definitely wasn\u2019t a secret, and honestly, we wouldn\u2019t have thought it was a big deal if people did know. AND he had only met the bride and groom like six times and had zero issues with not being invited to such an intimate wedding. Also if it matters I was far from the only guest who didn't get a plus one and I never asked to be given a plus one for him.  I have no clue if the MoH told the bride and if the bride also thinks this was inappropriate. If she hasn't I really don't want to contact her during her honeymoon to start drama. I didn't check or anything beforehand (that's my bad, I guess) so was inviting him really a big deal?",

The big issue right now is that they eloped, which they are allowed to do obviously. He told everyone last night at diner. It was a big shock to everyone since for the longest time they didn't want to marry. When he told the news, our mother told him congratulations but it was clear that she wasn't very happy about it. She didn't say anything but her congratulations where forced and she looked close to crying. I asked if she was fine when cleaning up. Mom was sad that she didn't get to see him get married but overall she would be fine. My brother gave me a call later that night and he had an issue with her response. He wasn't happy at all that she wasn't very excited. That him and his wife found it disrespectful. I asked if mom said anything  to him and heconfirmed she didn't. I told him that mom isn't a fucking robot and she is allowed to be sad. That she didn't get to see her kid get married and being sad isn't an odd emotion to have about it.  This started an arguement and he thinks I am being a jerk for defending her. ",

The mom was really upset that I would suggest she couldn't take care of her daughter properly and that I was overstepping boundaries. I told her that my grandma-in-law just wanted to help her to help her daughter. She told me I was being rude and undermining her parenting. She also told me I wasn't the first person to bring this up. I'm worried now because I really didn't think she would react like that. I'm worried I've ruined my daughter's new friendship. I understand why she's upset at thinking I'm trying to suggests she's not looking after her daughter properly. On the other hand, it's 2024.

        "selftext": "Throwaway account because my main has personal info.   My (34F) mother (59F) has not worked for the last ~30 years. When we were little, dad worked and she was a SAHM. She refused to work even when we were older, I remember my parents fighting about it. After their divorce mom remarried almost instantly and relied on her (much older) husband, who died last year leaving everything for his adult kids and almost nothing for her.   After the death of her second husband, mom moved in with my brother and his wife. She was supposed to look after their kids while they work. This didn't work out and they are kicking her out, which is totally my mom's fault, I told her multiple times this would happen if she continued to act like she did. She was extremely mean to SIL, tried to run their household, acted like the queen, refused to watch the kids full time,which was their original agreement (she only watched them like half day twice a week and when she did she neglected them like not changing a poopy diaper for god knows how long because she was hoping SIL would be back soon and do it, which resulted in baby getting a very nasty rash, etc etc).   Now she wants to move in with me. She's claiming she'd help with the kid (I have a 2yo). I told her no, I saw what happened to my brother and SIL, you caused major issues in their marriage and I will not risk it. After all, you always told us adult children should never live with their parents (yes, we were both kicked out at 18 right after we finished school). She started crying and saying she doesn't have anywhere to go (she has until the end of the month to leave my brother's house). I told her neither did I when she kicked me out at 18 and I went to live on my friends couch but I worked and eventually rented a room so I guess that's what she should do - that's what everyone else does. She asked me to at least pay her rent until she gets back on her feet, I said no, you're a healthy working age person, you should not be freeloading (that's exactly what she told me when I was 18). We had a very big fight but I refused to let her move in or give her money. I'm sure she should still have some from her inheritance and I know for a fact my brother gave her money so I didn't feel guilty at all.   Now, multiple relatives are texting me, basically saying me and SIL are horrible people. Mom's dead husbands son called to scold me, telling me my mom is my responsibility and not theirs so I should do what's right. I do not feel guilty but perhaps that's what makes me the AH? Am I? I do feel bad about people claiming I'm a bad daughter. Mainly because my mother was never a model mom herself, she never put her kids first and was generally disinterested in us unless she needed something. I mean, if she were nice, I'd be happy to have her near ",

        "selftext": "My mom died when I (16M) was 5. I remember her, just not amazingly well. When I was 7 my dad started dating again and met Mara. At first I was upset about Mara and my dad dating and didn't want to meet her and gave her a hard time. I told her I didn't want her replacing my mom. She gave me space to let out all my feelings at her and then she reassured me she was not here to take mom's place. She told me she really liked my dad and wanted to really like me too but she didn't have to be my mom for us to like each other. At first I wasn't sure if I believed her. But she won me over and we got along really well. She even lived with us for a year. But when I was 10 dad broke up with Mara and said she wasn't trying hard enough to fill the role of mom for me and I needed a mom. I told him I didn't want another mom and I loved Mara. That she was the best. Mara was blindsided by it because things had been so good and I don't think my dad had said it would be a dealbreaker. Within a few months he met his wife, Stacey. Stacey was a single mom with a 2 year old daughter. I was 11 by then. Stacey was very on board to be my new mom and I was not. I said it so many times I didn't want a new mom, I wouldn't call someone else mom, I missed Mara and wouldn't give Stacey a chance if she tried to take over mom's place. I was ignored and dad and Stacey got married when I was 12. After my 16th birthday, which was June, my dad kinda realized I was serious about not wanting a mom and not giving Stacey a chance to be my mom. She has tried so hard too. She has tried to make me love her and her daughter. But I'm not here to get a new mom. I'm not open to it, something dad now knows. It's caused a lot of strain with him and Stacey because Stacey found out I had DMd Mara recently and apologized for dad and thanked her for being awesome and saying I miss her. Stacey said she can't even get me to say I like her. I told her it's because I don't. That I don't like people who don't listen or who think they can make me do things like let them be my new mom. Stacey said she was expecting/promised a family for her daughter. Not this. Dad pulled me aside a few nights ago and told me he now realizes I was serious about the things I said and he realizes I loved Mara. But that he really wanted the best for me and someone who wouldn't even try to be my mom wasn't it. He told me Stacey would be such a good second mom to me and I could have a sister, if I give this a chance. He said his marriage could end if we can't pull together as a family. I told him he made a dumb decision and I wouldn't fix it for him. I said it was fine if Mara just wasn't the one for him or if their relationship changed. But I loved her because she wasn't my mom. She was someone I could trust and love as Mara. And that my dislike of Stacey wasn't changing and neither was my unwillingness to get a new mom. Dad told me I don't get to speak to him like that. That I was out of line. AITA?",

This already makes me feel very awkward but now she has asked if I can stop wearing makeup and wear baggy clothes around him. We went out for dinner last night at a reasonably expensive restaurant with a few others (7 of us in total) and she text me when I got home saying she was angry at me for \u2018looking hot\u2019 after she asked me to not wear makeup. She\u2019s my friend and I want to do the right thing but there\u2019s nothing I could wear that is baggy that would have suited the restaurant we were in (Michelin star). My style is very conservative and I was wearing a very average dress with heels. I\u2019ve written out several responses ranging from an apology to being quite rude but wanted to sense check my thoughts here before I go back to her. I don\u2019t want to make life difficult for her but what she\u2019s asking for feels unreasonable. AITA?  Edit 1: thank you so much for all of your responses. It\u2019s 4.21am here in the UK so I will write out and send a response tomorrow and will update you all on here. Sorry I can\u2019t respond to everyone; I didn\u2019t expect so many responses.  Edit 2: While I was reading your responses, he just liked an old Instagram pic from way back (bikini pic!). He is now blocked.  FINAL UPDATE - Edit 3: I responded with the following: \u201cSorry it\u2019s taken me a while to reply but I wanted to consider this properly and not react emotively. I\u2019m sorry you feel that way but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair or reasonable to ask me to change how I look because of your husband. My advice is to speak to (husband\u2019s name) and work on your relationship because projecting your issues onto me isn\u2019t going to help you, but it will damage our friendship. You have nothing to be insecure about; you\u2019re the most beautiful person inside and out I\u2019ve ever met. I\u2019m here for you if you want to talk through it but ultimately I can\u2019t help it if I\u2019m smoking hot (just kidding).

She told me they were having problems and it was wrong of her to take it out on me. we\u2019ve had a long chat and I\u2019m going to be there to support my friend. Thank you all for your input; you all helped so much!! ADDITIONAL INFO: I\u2019ve had a lot of people message me asking if they can post my story elsewhere and a couple of reporters etc. I really don\u2019t want to exploit my friend\u2019s marriage so I don\u2019t mind if you use it but please keep me anonymous.

        "selftext": "let's get straight to the point, I (22F) am a full-time baker for a small business and college student. I moved back up to my home state in September of 2023, mostly to get away from my toxic family and for better opportunities. Also to add why this is even an issue in the first place, My brother Jay(25M) and I are the black sheep of the family, mostly due to the fact we were born and mostly raised outside of marriage. The teasing and neglect only grew worse after our mother(44F) married Jerkfish(54M) and had our half siblings; (20F), (17M), (16M), and (11M). Now, here's the dilemma. My half-sister who we will call Jojo(20F) is getting married to Rhitt(22M) in July. My mom and grandma asked that I make them a wedding cake, which I would've happily agreed to if I was invited to the wedding. The thing is, they wanted me to make a cake fit for 200 people, get a hotel near them (They hate that I'm not a Christian, so they think I'll bring evil into their house), work for 3 days, and get a flight there and back. I'd have to pay for all of it, they think it'd be a nice gift to my sister. I just laughed and sent them my price sheet, they. flipped. out. I was bombarded with texts from them about how selfish I am, how I am truly vile, how I am toxic for expecting my family to pay for my cake when they could just go to Walmart to get one, etc.. Jojo even messaged me on discord a week after I had sent the price sheet and asked why I would charge her when I made my best friend a free wedding cake. I simply told her to f off as not only was I invited to her wedding, but I was the MOH and in a way it was a returning the favor for being a genuinely good friend and helping me out when I was going through a lot. Jay and his wife had said I'm not wrong for it and they'd do the same thing, and my boyfriend is on my side. However, a few people in my life are saying I should've just said a simple no instead of sending the sheet and that my response to my sister was harsh. So, I need an outside perspective, hopefully other bakers on here too. AITA?   Update #1: I found out the exact reason for my brother's family and I not getting invited. Three months after my sister and her soon-to-be husband got engaged, my grandmother requested my sister not invite the sinners. It was more along the lines of: If you don't invite your siblings you'll get a hefty portion of my will.. Don't really know what the proper term for that is, but I digress.  So, my sister is catering to the needs of my racist grandmother over her own sisters. I also found out another reason(out of the many) why my brother and I where black sheep in the family. So, you see. my mother is whiter than paper. My brother and i's biological father is Lakota/Sioux native American.  We were told he just left us because that's how the savages act. when in reality, our dad died from a terminal raspatory illness that he had since he was a toddler. Some cyst type of deal? Not too sure. The hatred from them only grew further when my brother married a black woman and had my 3 nieces together. (Fourth on the way). I told jojo how hurt I was by picking money over family but I kinda expected it. She tried to offer me $50 to make the cake she wanted and I just declined. i shared this post with my brother and he is rolling while reading the comments. Also, to the people who dm'ed me to tell me that they hope i go out of business (My boss says hi btw) and that I deserved getting abused as child because I'm a snot now... F off. :) Stay awesome and brutal as ever reddit. Thank you for all of the support.",

        "selftext": "A few months ago me (28f) and my sister \u201cEva\u201d (33f) realized that we were both pregnant (I\u2019d say she was about 6 weeks further than I was). She\u2019s been struggling with infertility, so we were all happy for her. I have an older son (2m) with my husband (32m).  Sadly, a couple weeks ago I lost my baby. We told my family. They were all supportive, but I did sort of pull away from them. They would\u2019ve tried to avoid discussing Eva\u2019s baby around me, but I didn\u2019t want to overshadow her, especially since she\u2019s wanted this for a long time. I also didn\u2019t want to be reminded of my own loss whenever I saw her. So I haven\u2019t been to my parents\u2019 place for Sunday dinner since or really spent time with Eva, which we had been doing a lot before. I replied vaguely to any messages about my absence, wasn\u2019t the best communication from me. Yesterday my parents were hosting family dinner for my dad\u2019s birthday. I\u2019d been thinking about going because I missed my family, and while of course the pain of losing my child has not faded, I\u2019m at a point where I can at least put it a little to the side to be there for my sister and my new niece (when she is born).  So I let my family know that we would be coming. However, we had to get a gift for my dad and then my son had a bit of a tantrum, so we got to my parents\u2019 place about an hour late. I wished my dad and then went to the kitchen, where my mom, Eva, and my SILs were. But before I went in, I heard them say my name so I stopped. My mom was saying something like \u201cWell I guess [OP]\u2019s not coming\u201d and Eva said \u201cWhat did you expect, she probably changed her mind and is just staying home again. Honestly, I\u2019m sorry for her but you would think she was the first woman to ever lose a kid. And it\u2019s not even her first kid.\u201d They then kept talking about other things, but I just wanted to leave.  I went and got my husband, who was with my BIL, dad, and brothers in the living room. I told my dad I was really sorry but we needed to go. They all protested, but my husband could see how upset I was so he didn\u2019t. We got my son and left.  When we got home, I just kind of cried for a while. My husband asked me what happened and I told him. He was angry that she said that, but thought we shouldn\u2019t have abruptly left because my dad had been looking forward to seeing us, and my son missed his cousins. After this, I was feeling conflicted. Later my brother texted me saying my dad had been really upset about us leaving and brought it up at dinner, which caused a whole fight because mom and Eva realized that I must\u2019ve heard them talking, and my dad was mad about it. My brother said that it was pretty bad and he wished I had just stayed so none of it would\u2019ve happened, obviously Eva didn\u2019t mean for me to hear that, they were all just frustrated that I\u2019d been AWOL for so long.  Now I feel bad, because I didn\u2019t mean to ruin dinner. Obviously what Eva said was hurtful, but I can see how my actions might have led to her saying something out of anger, and I could\u2019ve talked to her about it later instead of just leaving. Idk, AITA? ETA for additional context: - My family is the type to just drop by at each other\u2019s places and see one other multiple times throughout the week besides just Sunday dinner. Lately I\u2019ve been kind of fielding off any requests for people to visit. I just want to I guess emphasize how close my family is and how abnormal it is for me to not be seeing them regularly even for a little bit. I haven\u2019t been ghosting them, but I just text them saying \u201cI\u2019m not feeling up to it\u201d for dinner and kind of leave it there. - My sister and my mom have always been closer to each other, as have me and my dad. Additionally, my brothers are closer to her since they\u2019re all closer in age. - I mentioned this in a comment, but we didn\u2019t text anyone saying we were going to be late since my family is usually pretty lax about time (me and my husband usually show up early though so it\u2019s unusual for us to be late and might\u2019ve been why they thought we weren\u2019t coming). Also my son was continuing to be a handful all the way there so that kept us busy and we kind of didn\u2019t think about notifying anyone. - I\u2019ve started looking into grief counseling, now that I feel like I can at least talk about it. - As far as she\u2019s told us, my sister hasn\u2019t had a miscarriage before, she just had trouble getting pregnant to begin with. - From what my brother told me, my sister and mom didn\u2019t admit to saying anything, they just kind of looked at each other once my dad mentioned me leaving, and he noticed and asked about it. Then one of my SILs who was also in the kitchen (my other brother\u2019s wife) mentioned what they said and my dad got mad. My other brother was also apparently angry with them and it just turned into my mom and sister trying to defend themselves, my dad and other brother yelling, and my brother (who texted me) trying to stay out of it.

        "selftext": "I (56F) divorced my husband two years ago after 26 years of marriage. We have four kids, and the split was amicable. He came out as gay, and we mutually agreed to part ways. Changing my name wasn\u2019t a priority\u2014updating IDs, legal documents, and bank accounts would be a huge hassle. I still use his last name on official documents but go by my maiden name socially. Recently, he got engaged to a wonderful guy. I\u2019ve been supportive of their relationship, but during my grandson\u2019s birthday party, my ex suddenly asked if I\u2019d consider dropping his last name. His fianc\u00e9 chimed in, saying it makes him uncomfortable that I still use it. I was caught off guard and awkwardly joked that unless they want to spend hours in lines at various government offices, I wasn\u2019t going to change it. My ex didn\u2019t laugh. He insisted it\u2019s about starting a new chapter and wants me to \u201cmove on.\u201d The whole situation felt bizarre. For two years, it\u2019s never been an issue, and now they\u2019re ganging up on me? After the party, my ex called and argued that keeping his name makes it hard for his fianc\u00e9 to feel like they\u2019re starting a fresh life. I countered that our kids still use the same name, and it would feel strange for me to be the odd one out. What really hurt was learning from my youngest son that his fianc\u00e9 feels threatened by my name, assuming I\u2019m clinging to some claim on my ex. I\u2019ve made it clear I have zero interest in rekindling anything, but it feels like I\u2019m being pressured to erase a part of my identity. My ex admitted his fianc\u00e9 is uncomfortable because he sees me keeping the name as a \u201cpower play.\u201d I feel like I\u2019m caught between trying to keep peace and being forced into something just because his fianc\u00e9 is insecure. They want me to go through the hassle of changing everything for their comfort. I told my ex that I\u2019ll consider it later\u2014maybe after they\u2019re married and settled. But now, he\u2019s furious, saying I\u2019m being petty and selfish. My friends think I should stand my ground, but my kids are divided\u2014one thinks I should just give in to keep the peace, while the other agrees that it\u2019s ridiculous to change it just because his fianc\u00e9 feels insecure. I\u2019m frustrated. I don\u2019t see why a name on some legal documents is such a big deal, but they\u2019re making me feel like the villain. So, AITA for refusing to drop my ex-husband\u2019s last name even though he\u2019s getting remarried?",

        "selftext": "Back when Eras tour tickets were released, my friend Sadie said she would grab us tickets and I\u2019d pay her back. We made concrete plans and I was excited. I\u2019ve been a Swiftie for years but haven't seen her live. I had to sell my Rep stadium tour tickets back in the 2010s because my mom was dying and I needed the money to help pay medical bills. I booked the hotel. This past weekend I was having a little get together for a bunch of friends and Sadie was of course invited. At some point she pulled me aside and told me that she had news, she is leaving in September. I was heartbroken! We\u2019ve been friends for years and I love spending time with her. I got weepy and hugged her a bunch and said that we needed to get all our thrifting trips in over the summer and hang out as much as we could. Then she broke the news that as a way to bond with her sister before she left, she was going to be taking her to the Eras tour instead. I didn\u2019t know how to react. She stood in front of me and Venmo\u2019d my payment back. She was like \u201cI know you understand.\u201d I said that this was a sneaky move and honestly really shitty of her, and I don\u2019t understand how or why she would do that to me. She got defensive and said that they were under her name and that she didn\u2019t \u201cowe me\u201d anything. I was like yes, they are your tickets. Legally, you can do whatever you want. But this is still a really shitty and sneaky thing to do to your friend, knowing that there is no way I will be able to get my own tickets at this point. She just kind of shrugged and said \u201cSorry, but I figured you\u2019d understand.\u201d I asked her to leave, and told her to please not come back for the 4th of July party next week. I said I needed to process this and that I\u2019m really disappointed with her and how she\u2019s treated me. This is a girl who I consoled through breakups, job losses, pet losses, etc. She looked shocked and asked if I was serious. She ended up stomping off and leaving and texted me later to tell me that she\u2019s \u201caround\u201d if I want to apologize for making HER feel bad about taking her sister on a \u201cbonding\u201d trip. I\u2019m honestly heartbroken that I\u2019m going to be watching \u201cmy\u201d show on a grainy livestream instead of being there in the stadium with everyone. I was looking forward to this so much. I checked the resale sites and had a sad little cry about it. I am wondering if I am completely wrong to have just uninvited her. Is that too far? If it was in, say, a month or two, I don\u2019t think I would have. I just need time? **Hi everyone and thank you for the responses so far. I just wanted to follow this up by saying that I appreciate the sentiment, but I'm not going to sue her over this. I don't really think that is a normal reaction or something that I would enjoy doing. Please don't hate me.**",

This way, no one is constantly hosting, and it makes it fair for everyone. This post is about my middle daughter, Clara. Clara has always been skipping her host duties, when it gets to her she has an excuse why she can't host. It ranges but usually goes along the lines of stress or she is too busy.  This results in other family members to pick up her holiday. It is frustrating and multiple people have talked to her about this. She bailed on hosting Easter but promised me that she would do Thanksgiving we swapped holidays. At the time I made it very clear she needed to stay true to her word and if she dumped it on someone else she wouldn't be going to Thanksgiving. It usually gets dumped on me. Anyway, I called her asking if she wanted me to bring a dessert board for Thanksgiving. She told me that she could not host because she had just moved into her home (she moved in July), and it was too messy to host. I told her she could clean since it was a few weeks away. She told me she can't.  I know the other kids can't host it, (well one could but she is doing Christmas and its not fair at all for her). I informed everyone it would beat my place this year. I also informed everyone that Clara is not invited this year to Thanksgiving. Clara was pissed when I told her that and we got into a huge argument. She thinks I am a big jerk. My other kids are split, two of them are happy since they are tired of picking up her slack when this happens while others things this is too far.    So outside opinion",

        "selftext": "Final Update: They have decided that a child free wedding isn't feasible. They will also be setting up a children's play area.  My cousin is getting married at the end of August in California at a vineyard. No one in the family is in California so to go I need to get a hotel. Me, my mom, and brother found an AirBNB that relatively close. Also I should mention my husband is posted abroad and won't be coming, I was going to fly to the US for this.  The invite came out only three weeks ago and we had to scramble to find a place.  The issue now is that I have a 4 month old baby who only breastfeeds and won't take a bottle. She had to drink from an open cup one time because I needed to take a driving exam and that is the longest she has ever been away from me.  They just let us know that no children under 12 are allowed. So I told them that logistically I can't come. They suggested that me and my mother go back and forth to the AirBNB to watch the baby and I said it's just too big of a deal. To fly all the way there, pay for an AirBNB and then go back and forth during the wedding. It just doesn't seem worth it, its a lot of effort to do all of that by myself with a small baby. The airbnb and plane are still refundable at this point.  My cousin is mad that I'm cancelling as they paid per head and can't reduce the amount at this point. I said they can try and find someone else to invite. I said it's his fault that they didn't write the child rule on the invitation. He said I should not be stingy and get a babysitter, I don't know anyone in that area of California and honestly paying for a babysitter on top of an AirBNB and flight is ridiculous to me. He says it standard to not bring children to weddings... So AITA for cancelling close to the date because I can't bring my baby with me.  Edits for clarity: Short notice is because bride is pregnant. I live with my husband in Germany where he is posted. Baby already has passport because she is only US citizen.Because of the shotgun nature the wedding, the invite consisted of a graphic image without particular guest names emailed to the guests. The RSVP system also let me choose up to three people(so I thought that was me, my baby, and my husband).  Update: Apparently about 30 people have cancelled because of this and that's why they are complaining so much about the costs ",

It took me a while to warm up to the group and to connect with people I actually had anything in common with. I had to wade through a lot of botox parties and boozy brunches to find things I was interested in. But I did, and I started coming to group events fairly often. I hang out most often with the women who like to read, do crafty things, bake, skywatch, etc. Among these women is one, I\u2019ll call her Andea, who has made several comments about how she\u2019s a total klepto. I think that she makes these comments to seem \u201ccool\u201d to the other people in the group. I reached out to some of the women I see regularly at these events and invited them over to my place to watch a TV show we\u2019d been talking about and do crafty stuff. They were excited and agreed to come. Unfortunately, Andrea found out (I assume someone asked if she was going) and reached out to me to ask if she was invited. I considered this for a bit and then told her no, as I only had so much room at home. She didn\u2019t believe me and asked me for the real reason, saying \u201cI thought we got along\u201d which yes, is true.\u00a0 I told her I\u2019m not comfortable inviting a kleptomaniac into my home. That I\u2019ve worked hard to have the things I have and it would be stupid for me to invite her knowing that she openly brags about it.\u00a0 She said \u2018Okay\u2019 very quietly. She then said \u201cYou\u2019re painting me out to be some horrible criminal when you don\u2019t even know anything about me.\u201d\u00a0 I said that her being proud to call herself a klepto was all I needed to know. She said that I was a high school mean girl and ableist. I am unsure what the foundation for that statement is. This unfortunately has spilled over to the group, which is frustrating. But what has me the most surprised is that there are so many people defending her and telling me that I\u2019m out of touch and take things too literally. Am I?",

        "selftext": "This situation has caused a lot of tension between my husband and me, and now I\u2019m questioning whether I\u2019m being unreasonable. I (30F) gave birth to our first child, *Olivia*, two months ago. Being a first-time mom has been both beautiful and overwhelming. My husband, *Jake* (32M), was incredibly supportive during the pregnancy and promised that after Olivia was born, he would be there for me every step of the way, especially during those challenging first few months. Before Olivia was born, Jake and his friends had been planning a bro\u2019s only trip for this summer\u2014a week-long vacation to a cabin in the mountains for hiking, fishing, and bonding. When the trip was being discussed, I reminded Jake that Olivia would only be a few months old, and we would be deep in the newborn phase. He reassured me that if things got too tough, he would cancel the trip to help me out, and I trusted him. Now that Olivia is here, things have been harder than I anticipated. Between the sleepless nights, breastfeeding struggles, and just trying to adjust to motherhood, I\u2019ve been feeling overwhelmed. Jake has been helpful, but I can tell he\u2019s excited about this trip, which is coming up next month. Last week, I asked Jake if he could consider canceling the trip, reminding him of his promise. I told him that I\u2019m struggling and that having him gone for a whole week would be really tough on me. He seemed surprised and a bit hurt that I was asking him to cancel. He said he\u2019s been looking forward to this trip for months, and that he needs a break, too. He also pointed out that his parents live nearby and could help if I needed support while he was away. I understand that Jake needs a break and wants to spend time with his friends, but I can\u2019t help feeling like this is a time when I really need him by my side. I tried to explain that while I appreciate his parents' help, it\u2019s not the same as having him here. Jake said that I\u2019m being unfair by asking him to cancel the trip after all the planning that went into it and that I need to trust him to make sure I\u2019m supported even if he\u2019s not physically there. Now, we\u2019re at a bit of a standoff. Some of my friends think I should let him go, saying that it\u2019s important for him to have some time away, especially after all the stress of becoming a new dad. But others agree that it\u2019s too soon for him to take off for a week, and that he should prioritize being home with me and Olivia. So AITA for asking my husband to cancel his bro\u2019s only trip to help me with our newborn after he promised he would? edit: Hey, everyone. I just wanted to give a quick update after reading through most of the replies. I was honestly overwhelmed by the amount of support and understanding I received\u2014thank you so much to everyone who took the time to respond. Your kind words and thoughtful advice really helped me feel less alone in this situation. A lot of you suggested that I should also take a week off, letting Jake stay with Olivia, to get a break for myself. I really appreciate the sentiment behind that suggestion, but there are a couple of reasons why it\u2019s not realistic for me right now. First of all, I\u2019m breastfeeding, so being away from Olivia for that long would be really difficult logistically. But beyond that, and this is something I know I need to work on, I just don\u2019t feel comfortable being away from my baby yet. I know it\u2019s not healthy to feel like I can\u2019t have her out of my sight, but I can\u2019t help it. I guess it\u2019s just that new mom anxiety that\u2019s really hard to shake. I\u2019ve been debating whether or not to show Jake this thread. I\u2019m worried that reading it might hurt his feelings, but I\u2019m definitely going to have another conversation with him about everything. I\u2019m willing to compromise and let him go on the trip, but I think a whole week is just too much. I\u2019m leaning towards suggesting that he limit the trip to a maximum of three nights, so he can still have some time away with his friends but not be gone for an entire week. I\u2019ll update again after we\u2019ve talked. Thanks again for all the support, everyone. It really means a lot to me. Also, I'm new to Reddit, not sure if I should be posting updates or just editing this post.   UPDATE Hey, everyone. I just wanted to share another update after having a very long and emotional talk with Jake. I won\u2019t get into every detail of our conversation, but I\u2019ll touch on the most important points. After putting Olivia to bed, I went straight to bed myself, feeling utterly exhausted. Jake was already asleep, but for some reason, the weight of everything just hit me all at once, and I started crying uncontrollably. My sobbing woke Jake up, and he immediately asked me what was wrong. I told him that I was just tired, but then I opened up about how anxious I\u2019d been feeling about his trip and being left alone with Olivia. I admitted something I\u2019ve been reluctant to say out loud\u2014that Jake hasn\u2019t been as involved as I thought he would be. This was one of my biggest fears when we found out we were having a baby. For context, Jake has a rocky relationship with his own dad. I won't go into detail about why his dad isn't the best but his mom (my mother-in-law) remarried when Jake was in middle school, and his dad wasn\u2019t very present in his life. Jake has expressed to me before that becoming a father was scary for him because he\u2019s afraid of being a bad one, just like his dad. When he first told me that, I thought it would make him into a great father, because it showed how much he cared about being a good dad long before we were even pregnant. When I vented to him about all of this, at first, he tried to defend himself. He admitted that he\u2019s been freaking out about having a baby for so long and just didn\u2019t want to tell me. He said he didn\u2019t want to stress me out while I was pregnant because he knows how much I\u2019ve always wanted to be a mother. Hearing him say that made me feel guilty, like I hadn\u2019t seen how much he\u2019s been struggling internally. I had tried to convince him that he was going to be a great dad when we had this conversation long ago, and now it all felt more complicated. I thought to myself, *This can\u2019t go on much longer.* I realized that if he was going to keep pulling away like this, I didn\u2019t know if I could handle it. So I asked him, \u201cIs this what our life is going to look like from now on? Me with Olivia and you away? Because if it is, Jake, then I don\u2019t think I can continue on like this.\u201d Jake told me to calm down and assured me that he wasn\u2019t going anywhere. Then he got really emotional\u2014he even started to tear up. He said he didn\u2019t want to turn into his dad, and that he hadn\u2019t realized that going on this trip could be a preliminary step toward becoming the absentee father he feared he might be. He apologized for not considering me and Olivia as much as he should have. Long story short, Jake called his friends and told them he wouldn\u2019t be able to make the trip. He\u2019s even started planning a little family getaway for the three of us next year when Olivia is a bit older. It was a tough conversation, but I feel like we\u2019re on the same page now, and I\u2019m hopeful that things will get better from here. Thanks again to everyone for your support and advice. It\u2019s been an emotional rollercoaster, but I\u2019m grateful for this community helping me navigate it.",

My mom died and I live in her house with my girlfriend and her child.  In my adult life my relationship has been the same with my dad. He reached out after my mom\u2019s death but he never really made the effort and it always felt that if he tried to have a relationship with me it was always for a new girlfriend or wife benefit not mine.  My dad recently had a bed wreck and his apartment only had stairs. Him and his new wife acted like they will move into my home since it\u2019s an old school ranch house. All one floor.  I told him no. He asked my why I didn\u2019t trust him and he would pay rent. I told him why would I trust him to pay rent when he never paid my mom child support for years.  His wife told me that was a rude thing to say.  I told maybe my they should ask one of her kids (she has 5) or one of my dad\u2019s 3 other kids because of 1 of 9 I\u2019m not stepping up to help because my dad has never helped me.  They accused me of dragging up their past and I told them their attitude is not going to mesh with mine long term.

        "selftext": "A few days back I was out for dinner with 2 friends. Ann is pregnant currently (ca. 17 weeks), Kim is married for 3 years and currently desperately trying to get pregnant. Because Ann is pregnant, Kim cannot stand the idea of not being pregnant yet and that is all she can think or talk about. Though it doesn\u2019t interest me much (as someone who doesn\u2019t plan on ever having children), I happen to have developed a good tolerance for pregnancy/child related topics because all my friends are either pregnant or parents. During dinner they spoke only about pregnancies and childbirth (where I was hoping to catch up on other topics). I couldn\u2019t get them to talk about anything else, despite politely and subtly trying to change the topic several times. But as I understand that these topics interest them more right now, I very politely contributed to the conversation where I could, otherwise I let them talk as they pleased.  A baby started crying in our vicinity and kept crying for a while even though the mother tried to calm it down. It didn\u2019t seem hurt in any way, it seemed to be a normal cry for a baby. I noticed it start crying because it was loud and then didn\u2019t notice it anymore. I know it was crying because that\u2019s what my friends kept talking about but I tuned it out and went back to savoring my desert. The crying was like background noise to me.  But then my friends notice how I\u2019m enjoying my desert and not contributing to their conversation about how sad they feel for the baby and how it\u2019s making their heartache.  As in, they were having some sort of \u2018physical reaction\u2019 to the baby crying. I tell them that I don\u2019t hear the baby cry anymore. They asked me if I had a hearing issue, so I explained how it was like background noise to me after the first 10 seconds. Both of them looked at me in horror and pity. Kim told me that it is good I don\u2019t plan on having children because I\u2019m heartless and that my baby would be unlucky to be my baby. Ann said that she pities me that I\u2019ll never know the feeling that they both had.  I laughed at their comments because I thought that Kim wasn\u2019t very serious about her comment, and Ann is going through a few hormonal changes with her pregnancy and deserves some leniency regarding what she says to me. But they both got mad at me. According to them it wasn\u2019t something to laugh about. Neither of these comments bothered me at first, but after I posted about it yesterday, I received a lot of comments telling me that they are not good friends.  I argued in their favor because of their difficult situations. They are emotionally having a tough time, but after what happened today, I\u2019m not so sure anymore.  Kim texted me today saying that I need to start showing a little more concern towards crying children if I am to spend time with her future children. When I asked her if my heart should ache everytime a strange child cried just because I have a uterus, she called me an asshole.  So AITA for ignoring that crying child? ",

        "selftext": "About two weeks ago my 14 year old daughter Bonnie was out shopping with her best friend Gigi and Gigi\u2019s mom Lauren. While they were out, Lauren bought them both dresses she thought were cute. Except she bought Bonnie a size 3. Bonnie said she picked out one that was her size, but Lauren put it back and said that the size 3 one would be her \u201caspirational\u201d dress to work towards fitting into. When she came home, she gave it to me and was upset but also didn't want to say anything bad about Gigi's mom, which I get. First off, Bonnie is a HEALTHY girl. Gymnastics until she was about 11 (and grew several inches), dance in the fall and track in the spring, all her choices. So she's got an athletic build. Gigi is a small girl, barely 5 feet, and so I thought at first she got them mixed up. She told me that Gigi\u2019s mom got it for her to aspire to try to get into by \u201cworking hard.\u201d I said I\u2019d take care of it and get her the right size. The next day, I called Gigi\u2019s mom Lauren and asked her why she would do that. She explained that she thought it would give Bonnie something to work towards, because she heard Bonnie saying she didn\u2019t get asked out last year but Gigi had several boys after her and that it seemed like it upset her. I told her it was inappropriate and asked her why she would tell a kid she needed to lose weight in order to get attention from boys? She got defensive and said that it was obviously embarrassing for Bonnie to not have boys into her when all her friends do. She basically said I\u2019m holding Bonnie back from growing up\u2014like I won\u2019t help her with boys, won\u2019t drop hundreds at Sephora, still dress her like a kid, and buy B&BW sprays instead of fancy perfumes. She said it\u2019s messing with Bonnie socially and that she\u2019s the only one in her friend group who hasn\u2019t had a boyfriend. Then she got personal and said just because I\u2019ve \u201cgiven up\u201d and stopped trying doesn\u2019t mean I have to turn Bonnie into a nun. FOR THE RECORD, this is partially true. But it's also because Bonnie doesn't WANT that stuff. I have offered to get her more than Cetaphil skincare and she doesn't want it. She got straight As last year and I took her to Ulta for a spree and sall she wanted was some lip gloss and then ASKED for the body spray instead. I said that it\u2019s time for a break. The girls can still hang out, but I don\u2019t want Bonnie at Gigi\u2019s house. Bonnie got upset over it and I can deal with that. Gigi\u2019s mom however has gone NUCLEAR over it, spreading poison everywhere she can about me being \u201cpsycho\u201d and doubling down on how it\u2019s all because I don\u2019t want my daughter to be happy with a boyfriend when I\u2019m single and \u201cno man would touch me.\u201d Which is just\u2026 childish. And I\u2019ve been shocked to see how other people have reacted to this, so now I\u2019m questioning my own parenting which I NEVER do. AITA!?",

        "selftext": "I (26M) am getting married to my fianc\u00e9e,(let\u2019s call her Sarah (25F), in a few months, and I\u2019m super excited about it. But there\u2019s one big issue with all the planning\u2014my mom. A little background: My parents divorced when I was 8, and my mom (let\u2019s call her Layla) remarried pretty quickly after that. She married this guy, Dave, who had two kids of his own. Ever since, it\u2019s like I was no longer a priority in her life. She focused all her attention on Dave and his kids. Like, I\u2019m not exaggerating when I say she treated them way better than me. They\u2019d go on trips, she\u2019d go to all their sport events, and they\u2019d get everything they wanted. Meanwhile, I felt like I was invisible. She didn\u2019t ask about my school, didn\u2019t care about my friends, or even my mental health. I started to feel like I wasn\u2019t even her kid anymore  When I turned 18, I moved out. I thought maybe she\u2019d care and try to stay in touch, but nope\u2014she didn\u2019t. I\u2019d text her once in a while just to check in, and she\u2019d either not respond or say she was busy with Dave and his kids. I figured if she didn\u2019t care, why should I? So, I just stopped trying to reach out. Fast forward to now. I\u2019m planning my wedding, and out of nowhere, my mom starts texting me like we\u2019re super close. She wants to know all the details, saying how excited she is, and even saying things like, \u201cI can\u2019t wait to see you start this new chapter.\u201d Like\u2026 seriously? I haven\u2019t heard from her in years, and now she expects to be front and center for my wedding? I told her straight up that I didn\u2019t want her there. I said I\u2019m not comfortable with her coming after everything that\u2019s happened, and that if she really wants to have a relationship, we can talk about it after the wedding, but not before. She started crying and saying I\u2019m holding a grudge and that \u201cI\u2019m her son\u201d and \u201cshe deserves to be there.\u201d But I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m supposed to just forget the fact that she ignored me my whole childhood in favor of Dave\u2019s kids. Now, my family is split. Some of them think I\u2019m right and that I shouldn\u2019t just let her show up when she never showed up for me. Others think I should just let it go, and \u201cit\u2019s just one day\u201d and that I should let her come to the wedding to keep the peace. So\u2026 AITA for not letting my mom come to my wedding after everything that happened?",

Coincidentally, the death of one of my coworkers meant I had to work a lot more during those weeks, and I was honestly pretty miserable and pent up the whole time. The one thing keeping me going was the thought of having a wild night when he got home. My boyfriend\u2019s sister texted me and asked if she could come over when he got home. I said we would both be really tired and eager to be alone, and said it\u2019d be best to wait. Then I put my phone on silent, which meant I didn\u2019t see her next text that said she \u201cknew her brother, he\u2019ll find energy to say hi\u201d When he got home, the moment he was sufficiently unpacked, I changed into a playboy bunny suit. Then his sister knocked on the door and yelled hello. I was pretty pissed off, so I didn\u2019t put in any effort to hide my angry expression and answered the door in the outfit. I was pretty cold with her, and she got passive aggressive before reluctantly leaving. She said it was petty and dramatic over the phone, and I just hung up, prompting some angry texts. AITA?",

I don\u2019t want to complain about being small, but there are a lot of people out there (esp. other women) who will not take us seriously, are judgmental, make snide comments, assume attraction to us is nefarious, etc. A lot of comments that imply we\u2019re not real women etc. I\u2019m used to it and usually let it roll off my back. But there\u2019s a new one that\u2019s picked up momentum that I guess stems from a TV show where a girl is putting on a childish act and she says \u201cI\u2019m a very sexy baby\u201d in a cutesy voice and there\u2019s a LOT more to it that you can just Google. My SIL Cassie has picked this up and has been using this \u201cagainst me.\u201d I can\u2019t wear a cute outfit without her coming down on me and chiding me for \u201cbuying into the whole sexy baby thing\u201d when I am JUST WEARING AN OUTFIT. I\u2019m just trying to be ME. God forbid I wear a shorter skirt or bows or anything I think is cute. It\u2019s like I\u2019m not allowed to wear cute or sexy things because I\u2019m petite so I\u2019m automatically seen as trying to be a \u201csexy baby\u201d when I\u2019m not. I\u2019ve asked Cassie to stop or drop it and she maintains that I\u2019m the one opening myself up to judgment and I should dress my age. This came to a head last weekend when we were in my auntie\u2019s backyard at the pool. I took off my wrap so I could hang with my feet in the pool with my cousins and Cassie immediately said \u201cYou\u2019re a very sexy baby\u201d at me and twirled imaginary pigtails. I raised my voice and said \u201cThat\u2019s a really weird thing to keep saying. What is your problem with me? Why do you keep bringing up that I\u2019m small?\u201d She started to turn red and she yelled back again that I\u2019m the one that\u2019s choosing to walk around looking like the \u201csexy baby.\u201d I said that I\u2019m literally just wearing a bathing suit (a one piece halter) and asked her what I should be wearing instead if that\u2019s such a problem. She yelled back that I should \u201cdress like a grown adult\u201d and to stop trying to cause a scene in front of everyone. I said whatever and just tried to ignore her. Later on we ended up inside at the same time and she came down on me for calling her out in front of everyone. I told her to stop trying to make me feel bad for being small, that I didn\u2019t choose this body. She rolled her eyes and told me to grow the fuck up, and that \u201ctrying to start shit\u201d with her is even more proof. I am at a loss here and I\u2019m starting to just not want to be around my family because of her. It\u2019s not enough that I get this shit from women at work, at the gym, basically anywhere, now it\u2019s in my family. AITA for calling her out? Or even for just\u2026 idk, existing in my own body? **Edit** Hey I'm adding this in bc I can't respond to every comment, but it's my brother's wife, he doesn't care. Weve never been close/gotten along. He'll always take her side. Other people in my family are very hands off/handle your business yourself. Just the way they are.  Also Cassie isn't fat, she's just average height.",
