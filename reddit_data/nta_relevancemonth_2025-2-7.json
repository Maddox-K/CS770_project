        "selftext": "I (27F) hit one year sober (from alcohol) at the beginning of the year. This was a huge accomplishment for me. It was bigger to me than finishing college. I told my family that next time we were together for family dinner I had something to celebrate. This all happened at my mom\u2019s. The kids were playing and the adults were hanging out. I took the moment to share that I\u2019d reached 1 year sober and how good I felt about it.\u00a0 They went with \u201cOhh, that\u2019s what you were talking about\u201d and \u201cHas it been a year already?\u201d I am embarrassed to admit I hoped someone would say they\u2019re proud of me. My BIL Steve looked at my sister and they both said \u201cWell\u2026\u201d at the same time and she said \u201cSince we\u2019re all here, (Niece) just got into (a specific gymnastics thing). It\u2019s been a LONG road but she did it!\u201d Steve popped some wine they'd brought and started giving everyone glasses/cups. He made eye contact with me and his face fell. I had this gnawing feeling so got up from the table. I took a walk. I tried to get through the moment mentally so I could be present for my niece to celebrate her success. But when I got back to the house my sister asked me why I left without saying anything. I said I needed a minute to myself. She looked at me funny and said \u201cOkayyyy\u2026\u201d I said I\u2019d shared something I was very proud of and she bulldozed over it. My mom put her hand up and asked me what my news was. I said that I\u2019d told them. I hit one year sober. Mom said my generation always wanted praise for doing the bare minimum, that wasn\u2019t an accomplishment it was just what I needed to do, like graduating high school. I tried to make it through to dinner but found myself just not in the mood anymore. I decided to go home.\u00a0 **Here is the direct thing I am being called a butthead for:** Id brought a small berry chantilly cake (my favorite) to share after dinner. It was the thing I decided I earned. The kids had definitely seen it. On my way out I decided to take it home with me.\u00a0 I guess when they realized the cake wasn\u2019t in the garage fridge anymore, my sister called to ask me why I took it. I said I did because it was MY cake to celebrate MY accomplishment. She said, word for word \u201cAre you fucking serious? Oh my god Emma, GROW UP. You are such a fucking baby.\u201d My Mom later texted me directly to tell me how disappointed she was that I threw a tantrum because my niece got more attention than me. I don\u2019t think her read of what happened is right, but that is why I am asking you guys. Am I the asshole because I took home the cake in the end? Was that really childish of me, considering the kids saw it and then didn\u2019t get any? As I was putting on my shoes to leave, Steve found me and directly apologized and said that he was completely oblivious in the moment. I know he did not do anything to intentionally hurt me. **EDIT FOLLOW UP:** Hi everyone, I just wanted to follow up and say thank you to everyone for the responses. I have a lot to think about when I next go to therapy (today, actually) and work on. I do want to clear up a few things that I've seen come up a lot on the comments: I am not in AA. I'd tried AA before and it was not compatible for me. It works for a lot of people very well and I'm happy for you if it works for you. So, stuff about the steps and personal inventory are not relevant to me. It wasn't a party for my niece, it was just a family dinner. The cake *was mine* and wasn't brought *for* my niece. I didn't take it *because* I wanted to get back at them. I took it because it's my favorite cake and I wanted to eat it because it was my thing that I earned.   I don't know why they opened wine for my niece getting into the gymnastic program. But I also don't think it's my place to say anyone else has a drinking problem, and I'd prefer to have eyes on my own paper. :)",

        "selftext": "I made a blanket for my sister in law Amanda. I was able to give it to her last weekend. She\u2019d asked for it in certain colors. I didn\u2019t have any other projects on my to do list so I was happy to make it for her. I had most of the colors already too so it worked out. When I gave it to her she was excited and she started to look it over, I figured it was to see how it was put together, since she doesn\u2019t crochet. After a little bit she said that she loved the blanket, BUT she couldn\u2019t help but notice some of the little mistakes I\u2019d made along the way. I asked her what she meant, and she pointed out some things like I\u2019d accidentally done one row of striping instead of three for one section, I\u2019d switched to the wrong color and threw off a \u201cpattern\u201d at some point, etc.  She handed it back to me and told me that she loves my progress with it and couldn\u2019t wait to see the finished project. I told her that it was finished. She looked down at it and said that it wasn\u2019t done until it was perfect, and I\u2019d made several mistakes that I could easily go back to correct. I was honestly dumbfounded by this. I hate the way perfectionists try to force their quirk onto others. I made this blanket for her for free out of my own free time because I love her. I told her that. She said she knows and she loves me for it but that she wouldn\u2019t be able to use it because she wouldn\u2019t be able to focus on anything but the mistakes. I said whatever and took the blanket back and said that if she doesn\u2019t want it, I\u2019ll keep it. She looked surprised and said that she does want it, she just wants my best work and not something half assed. I told her that if she thinks me crocheting A WHOLE FUCKING BLANKET and making minimal errors is half assing it, I\u2019d rather just keep the blanket. She\u2019s so upset with me and told me I was acting ridiculous and that it wouldn\u2019t take me long to fix it. If you know anything about crochet you know that if I made an error on row 36 of a 1115 row blanket\u2026 that\u2019s essentially starting over again. Anyway I come to you all lol AITA? ",

        "selftext": "(It\u2019s NOT a dollhouse, but I didn\u2019t want anyone to think I was being misleading on purpose by saying I built a house) I (28M) made my wife (28f) a replica of a house that\u2019s known to fans of a musician, but wouldn\u2019t mean much to others. It\u2019s about 2 feet tall and wasn\u2019t very complicated to build, but my wife had said a few times over last year that she thought it would be cool to have for little trinkets. She\u2019s like a crow with her trinkets, I love it. She didn\u2019t know I was making it for her, but I did sneakily involve her in its creation through having her make a couple Tiktoks when we were out together so I could get the colors right. She has no idea, lol.\u00a0 I was excited, so I showed a picture to my brother. He told me it was cool, but didn\u2019t get the purpose. He showed it to my niece Ava (13f) who knew what it was and said she wanted one too. My brother asked if I would give it to Ava for her birthday. I said no, it\u2019s for my wife, but I could make one with Ava. It would help teach her some basic woodworking skills which they don\u2019t do in schools here anymore. I\u2019d like that. Brother said if it was so easy then I could make a second one for my wife and just give this one to Ava since her bday is the end of the month. Again I said no, this was done specifically for my wife. He seemed to accept that but then came back to me and said \u201cIsn\u2019t it a little weird to make a dollhouse for an adult woman?\u201d I told him it\u2019s not a dollhouse, just a fancy shelf. He argued that makes it worse, because Ava would actually \u201cplay\u201d with it. He must have gone to complain to mom about it (he is the younger brother) because mom called me to tell me that it was \u201cstupid\u201d to give my wife a dollhouse. I tried to explain that it\u2019s not a dollhouse but she just kept saying \u201cthat\u2019s stupid.\u201d\u00a0 This weekend I was at their house and Ava kept bringing up the house and laying it on thick with statements like \u201cI\u2019ve alway wanted one just like it.\u201d She kept asking why my wife wanted a dollhouse. I said it\u2019s not a dollhouse, but she kept asking why she needed a dollhouse. I told my brother that he was encouraging his kid to be manipulative and I really didn\u2019t like it, so I was going to leave. He told me that I was dangling the house over her head like McDonald\u2019s and teasing her and that it made me a bad uncle. Being a good uncle is important to me and I do feel for the girl because she\u2019s a big fan too. I admit I have a blind spot for this because I don\u2019t have kids and maybe I shouldn\u2019t have shared the picture with my brother to begin with. Am I really the asshole for not just giving it to her? Yes, it WAS easy to make and I COULD make another quickly. **Sorry guys Ava isn't my brother's biological daughter, there's a long story involved that I didn't want to add but I should've realized the age would be surprising.** I still see her as my niece regardless but I get why that would be alarming.

        "selftext": "My (33F) daughter \u201cCleo\u201d (5yo) hates pink. She has disliked the color and almost everything to do with it since she was about three or so. She has one pink shirt she likes and one pink stuffed animal, and that\u2019s it. My father\u2019s partner, \u201cPrue,\u201d refuses to accept that Cleo doesn\u2019t like pink. Over the years, she\u2019s made several attempts to push the color onto her (pretty much every gift she\u2019s ever given her was some shade of pink), no matter how many times I tell her to stop. She has tried to give me dozens of different reasons why I should encourage my daughter to \u201ctry different shades.\u201d It clearly upsets Cleo, but Prue keeps doing it. About a week ago, my father invited me, my husband and our children for dinner at his place. He said he and Prue had a surprise for the kids. Right before we left home, my younger sister (who still lives with our father) texted me. She warned me that the \u201csurprise\u201d was actually a small birthday party Prue had planned for Cleo. That alone threw me off, because my daughter\u2019s birthday was in November. My father did miss her actual birthday party due to work, but still. Also, my son turns 9 in March, so I had figured his would be the next party we\u2019d have. Then she sent me photos of how the place was decorated, and it very clearly wasn\u2019t actually meant for Cleo. Literally every piece of decor was pink. The table, the tableware, the balloons, everything. She had gotten pink banners and glued pink foil fringe curtains on the doors. Even the cake was pink. I showed everything to my husband, and we agreed not to take the kids there. I texted my father the following: \u201cHey, (sister) told me everything. We\u2019re not coming. We\u2019re taking the kids to McDonalds and telling them that was your surprise. You and Prue can come if you want, we\u2019re paying.\u201d We did exactly that. My father did show up (without Prue), but he was cold with us and left 20 minutes after arriving. Both him and Prue are pissed. My father is angry that my husband and I dismissed his partner\u2019s \u201cheartfelt gesture\u201d towards our daughter. Prue also told me that I\u2019m the reason Cleo is \u201crestrictive\u201d (I also don\u2019t like pink), and I\u2019m raising her to be an ungrateful, spoiled brat who is unwilling to compromise. To be honest, I get how I could be in the wrong here. But at the same time, this just felt like Prue trying to push something Cleo doesn\u2019t like onto her yet again. My sister and one of my brothers are on my side (though my sister did say I had been rude). My other brother is on the fence. AITA? EDIT: My daughter doesn't know I dislike pink, nor would I care if she did like it. EDIT: I have written an update, as well as a separate post to sum up the comments I left here.",

        "selftext": "Let's jump into this: I (29F) gave birth to my 3rd baby in November.  The women in my husband's family (his 2 sisters, our sil, and his mom) and I have a group chat whereas we send pictures of our kids, tell funny stories about our day, and, in this case, send updates about possible labor.  On this particular day in November, at 37 weeks plus 5 days gestation, I reached out to inform that this just might be the day my newest baby decides to make his grand entrance. I had been having strong contractions since 5:50 that morning.  Everyone, except sil (my husband's brother's wife) responded with excitement and praying hands emoji's.  Well, according to the nurses at the hospital, I wasn't dilated enough to be admitted, despite strong and frequent contractions.This was at noon. I updated the chat. Everyone seemed concerned and asked if I still thought if it might still be that day.  I assured it was most likely going to happen that day, judging from past experiences, but I would go home to labor in comfort. This is where i might be the a-hole.  My sil, who also gave birth to her 3rd baby a couple months prior (via c-section. I am not judging nor think of her as less than, just context is key) decided to text how glad she was that I wasn't in real labor and that it's better that I wait to have the baby another couple of weeks. She then sent a bunch of screen shots and links to articles about false labor and Braxton hicks. AS IF I HAD NEVER GIVEN BIRTH BEFORE OR EXPERIENCED PREGNANCY BEFORE. I replied, mid contraction:  Not to be bity, but this ain't my first rodeo, and I know how to Google things as well.  And yes, I have been checked, and they will check again before deciding IF I should go home or not. Well, I did go home, only to go back to the hospital a couple of hours later and had my baby at 10:15 that night.  Sil does not reply to me in texts, and has since unfriended me on Facebook. (Not that I really care about that.)  I just want to know it I was an a-hole for what I said... and, in hindsight, perhaps I shouldn't have been texting in the groupchat while in labor.  So, reddit. Was I an a-hole? Edit: I meant to elaborate on the c-section detail. Which definitely makes me come across as someone who looks down on her for it. Which I do not.  Her first baby was a preemie and she had an emergency c-section. Her youngest 2 were scheduled. The point I was trying to make was that our experiences with pregnancy and childbirth are completely different.  Which, I could have said without the c-section fact. My apologies.  Edit: a little more info about my sil and my relationship. She thinks she's the matriarch of the family, even if she won't admit it. We recently moved out of state (only 2 hours away, long drive, but not as long as they treat it), a few months before I gave birth, and she started cutting us out of family get together and even created a whole new group chat without my husband and me. She is always shocked at how intelligent my husband is because he went to community college instead of a university, like she did. I didn't go to college. I saw no point in going into debt, I didn't know what I would go to college for, so I decided to wait. So she often treats me like I am unintelligent.  I think the snappy text was probably long incoming. But it was poorly timed and shouldn't have been in a group chat.It was not the first time I had gone off on her in a group chat either. She singled me out a few months prior, questioning my ability to care for my kids by myself while my husband was away for a couple of days.  Yes, in the big family group chat.So I snapped back. My husband saw the message before me and said I'll let you handle her. As he held me back many times beforehand to keep peace. Like I said, it was possibly poorly timed but long incoming. ",

        "selftext": "I 49F have 2 adult children who both still live at home, Emma 25F and Ian 23M. Their father and I divorced 12 years ago so it\u2019s been the 3 of us for a while now. I had received child support until they turned 18. Their father had paid it willingly so it wasn\u2019t arranged through the courts. This is why he stopped at 18 even though they were both technically still in school.  Fast forward to present day. They both work full time, don\u2019t have any debt from school, and both still live at home. I have asked them repeatedly to contribute a set amount each month towards household expenses since I can\u2019t continue supporting them forever. Ian doesn\u2019t have a problem with this, but Emma thinks it\u2019s my responsibility as her mother to support her financially until she\u2019s ready to move out. I\u2019m not asking them for much or trying to profit from them, I just want to be able to save for my retirement and be able to retire. I\u2019d be happy with $100 each a week to cover their share of groceries, utilities, and household supplies. I buy all the groceries, laundry detergent, toilet paper, etc for the house. They are responsible for their cars and related expenses, cell phones, and personal toiletries.  Some of my daughter\u2019s friends live at home for free, but those friends also live in a home with both parents working. My daughter has actually said she will quit her job and go on social assistance just so she can\u2019t afford to pay me rent.  So internet strangers, AITA for asking my adult children to pay rent to live at home?",

        "selftext": "Last night when getting ready for bed I tried taking a picture of how my wife was laying in the bed to show her how little space I had. She made a joke of it and hid under the blankets. We have a king size bed,  have a toddler that sleeps between us, and my wife keeps a pillow between her and the toddler. I was trying to show my wife that her and her pillow already took up over half of the bed, leaving me with little to no space, especially once or toddler laid down.  I tried telling her I needed more room but she kept making a joke of it. So I got in bed, grabbed the pillow she keeps at her back and tossed it into the hallway saying here this will help. The next thing I know my wife is furious, crying, and is gathering her other pillows and blanket saying if I'm that much of a problem you can just have the bed to yourself. Her and our toddler went to the toddler's room to sleep (that bed is a full). This morning my wife is still mad and barely speaking to me so I ask AITA for throwing my wife's pillow out of the room? TLDR- wife takes up over half the bed with pillow wall between us, I tossed the divider pillow out of the room to allow myself more space. ",

My mom was a drug addict, stopping during pregnancy, but when Mj was about 5 months old she started back on drugs, dropping Mj off any place she could. Seeing this I wanted to give Mj a life that she deserved, not what our mother gave me, even though I was only 19, i filed a petition to get custody of her, it was a long hard process but when Mj was 2 i finally got full custody, all this to say, im legally Mj\u2019s dad. Im the only dad she knows and she calls me dad. A year ago I met my girlfriend, Ida (24f) and we started dating not long after, I really thought I found somebody to like me and Mj, Ida would always take Mj on \u2018girls days\u2019 and  little \u2018dates\u2019. I proposed to Ida on Sunday, it seemed like everything was great until a few hours ago. Ida was at my apartment having dinner with me and Mj, well when i was cooking dinner I heard Mj say something along the lines of \u2018Your gonna marry my daddy and your gonna be best friend\u2019 I thought it was cute until I heard Ida laugh and say \u2018He\u2019s not your dad Mj\u2019 which caught me off guard, i guess she thought i couldn\u2019t hear her because there\u2019s one a wall between the kitchen, but still i don\u2019t know why Ida said that. Mj was confused as 5 year olds are said I was and Ida kept correcting her until Mj started crying, Which honestly made me mad, I asked Ida why she would even say that and Ida stated \u2018She was going to find out eventually\u2019 and I was an arse for not telling Mj in the first place. I got mad and one thing led to another i said somethings i shouldn\u2019t have, telling her she had no right and Ida went home and Me and Mj had dinner alone, Ida started blowing up my phone later saying what I did was \u2018wrong\u2019 and basically was just ranting to me through text, I started doubting myself and now i\u2019m here. So AITA (I was gonna tell Mj i was her brother someday, yes, but when shes old enough to understand, Mj is only 5 she doesn\u2019t make sense of it) (Also sorry if im bad at explaining)",

        "selftext": "I had been seeing someone I met through mutual friends. We\u2019d had good times one-on-one, and when he invited me to events with his friends, I\u2019d contribute to the group dynamic by never showing up empty handed and offering to grab drinks for others. Fast forward to a holiday-themed party with his friends. My date and I planned to meet there and hang out afterward. I spent the day cleaning my condo and preparing mulled wine to bring. During the party, people were getting drinks for one another, including me when I served the wine. At one point, I was sitting on the couch, blocked in by only my date on one said and many others on my other side. I was tired and didn\u2019t feel like tightly squeezing past people I didn\u2019t know, so I asked my date if he could grab me a glass of water. He shook his head and after I said \u201chuh\u201d he said, \u201cNo. I was just up, and you could\u2019ve asked before I sat down again.\u201d I was taken aback because I view small gestures, like grabbing water, as basic acts of care for friends, but especially for someone you\u2019re dating. That moment, combined with a long day of preparation, left me feeling drained. Since the party was winding down and I didn\u2019t have the energy to engage further, I said my goodbyes and called a ride. My date offered to walk me out and said he felt hurt that I was leaving. I explained I needed to recharge but that he was welcome to come over after the party. As we walked out, I jokingly mentioned how him not getting me water surprised me. He replied, \u201cWow, that really upset you, huh? I have to be guarded about these things, you know.\u201d Later, we texted, but he seemed more upset about me leaving than interested in listening to why I felt drained. When I tried to call, he didn\u2019t answer. His texts were curt, and I eventually told him I\u2019d let him decompress. Two days later, I called to discuss what happened. He said he\u2019d call that evening but didn\u2019t reach out until three days later, saying, \u201cI\u2019m not dodging you, I\u2019ve just been busy.\u201d At that point, I was over it, especially since he never acknowledged the misunderstanding or my attempts to resolve it. A month later, we finally had a conversation. He explained that getting me water felt \u201csubservient\u201d and was something I had to earn through time and \u201cbeing in the trenches with him.\u201d He also said I didn\u2019t understand how busy his life was (for context, I work multiple jobs). I calmly explained that grabbing water for someone isn\u2019t about being subservient but a small act of kindness. After reflecting, I feel his responses and handling of the situation were disrespectful and indicative of bigger issues. So, is there an asshole here? I appreciate the perspective.",

We live in Germany where I work in an English-speaking environment, so to get extra practice in, I told him that after x date, we'd switch to German, which he is fluent in (grew up here). We've managed two days so far, where even if he accidentally says something in English I answer in German, but last night he told me he needed a break from me speaking German. I refused, and said it's only for 10 weeks until my exam, then I'll go back to English. He says I don't sound like his wife when I speak German. I asked if it was because my mistakes were jarring or my vocab was causing issues. He said it just 'didn't feel like he was speaking to his wife'. I think it's vital that I stick to my plan, to get my speaking practice in. He seemed a bit sad after I said no.WIBTAH if I carry on auf Deutsch?  UPDATE: Thanks to most of you for very well-thought out and reasonable comments. I tried to read as many as possible and appreciate the different viewpoints. My husband came home this evening, we ate dinner, and I apologised (in English) for not being very understanding. I showed him the post... some of the comments made us laugh so much.

I\u2019m talking $50 here for gas, $100 there during a trip, even once $300 when he needed to buy an \u2018emergency\u2019 PS5. I never really kept track because I trusted him. He paid me back some of it over time, but he still owes me a decent chunk, which I\u2019ve never bugged him about. He would occasionally \u2018gift\u2019 me skins in the games we play in an attempt to balance the books. A few weeks ago, Jake covered my $60 when I left my wallet at home during a group dinner. I told him I\u2019d get him back, but life got busy, and I totally forgot. A few days ago, he texted me, \u201ccan you send me that $60 from dinner?\u201d I apologized for forgetting and said I\u2019d send it that night to which he replied, \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have to chase you for this, man.\u201d That rubbed me the wrong way. I didn\u2019t say anything in the moment, but it really started to bug me. I thought about all the times I\u2019ve lent him money and how I never pressured him to pay me back. I\u2019ve never once sent him a passive-aggressive text or made him feel bad about it. So, I didn\u2019t send him the money right away and instead told him, \u201cLook I get that I owe you $60, and I\u2019ll pay you back but let\u2019s not pretend this is some one-sided thing. You still owe me hundreds, and I\u2019ve never hounded you about it.\u201d Jake didn\u2019t take that well. He said it\u2019s not the same thing because I never asked for my money back, so it\u2019s on me if I didn\u2019t care enough to get it. So now he\u2019s pissed at me thinking I did not pay him back intentionally and saying I\u2019m deflecting to avoid paying him back, and that I\u2019m being a stupid friend. I feel like I\u2019m in a weird spot here. Yeah I owe him $60, and ofcourse I\u2019ll pay it back. But on the other hand, his reaction feels so hypocritical given everything I\u2019ve done for him financially over the years. AITA? Edit: I paid him back like I always intended to do.",

It was my son's first time skiing, but he had seen a lot of skiing videos on YouTube, and he seemed really excited for the trip. We also live in Florida, so this is not the trip you can just go and do whenever you like (we are not rich). I grew up in Utah and I loved skiing when I was younger, and I would say I'm an expert on the mountain. The first day goes all good, and my son really enjoyed skiing for the first time, even though he fell a lot, lol. I made sure to be as supportive and caring as possible, even when he was struggling, because I wanted to make this as fun an experience as possible for him. However, on the second day of skiing, he says he's finally ready to ski down the whole mountain, and so we take the lift to the top. Luckily, there was a way to get down the mountain while only staying on green level trails, so we took that way.  My son is having a blast, when all of a sudden, this guy in his 20s careens into my son from behind going on insane speeds, wiping them both out. My son immediately started crying and came running to me after he got his skis off, and once he calmed down, he ran to the lodge where my wife was, and she decided to take him to the doctor's office. I immediately confront the guy for being so reckless, and he simply says that I should have been paying better attention to my kid, and then he rode off. That was the final straw for me, and I called the ski patrol number in the app and told the guy the situation and what the skier was wearing, and they told me they would find him and kick him out. Later on, I saw him getting escorted out of the park by two ski patrol officers, and when he saw me, he immediately started cursing me out and calling me a horrible dad. I tried to ignore it, but now I'm second guessing myself if I overreacted. So, AITA?",

Every New Year\u2019s Eve, my family has a big party at my aunt and uncle\u2019s house and every year, without fail, I end up being the DD. Don\u2019t get me wrong I love my family, but it\u2019s starting to bug me. It\u2019s been like this since I was 19, even before I was legally allowed to drink. I don\u2019t drink much\u2014maybe a glass of wine or a beer, but I don\u2019t get plastered. I\u2019m fine with driving people home if they need it, but for the past few years, everyone expects me to not drink so I can drive them back. Every year, it\u2019s the same: \u201cOh, can you drive? You\u2019re not drinking anyway!\u201d I always say yes because I don\u2019t want to let anyone down. Fast forward to this year\u2019s New Year\u2019s Eve. I told my family ahead of time I wasn\u2019t going to be the DD anymore. I just wanted to enjoy the night, have a couple of drinks, and not be responsible for getting everyone home. I even told my cousin who usually gets really sloshed that I wasn\u2019t driving this year, and she was fine with it. When I got to the party, it was the usual chaos. People were drinking, laughing, and having a good time. I was enjoying myself, but around 11, my cousin came over and asked if I was ready to drive everyone home. I reminded her I\u2019m not driving tonight, I\u2019m here to enjoy the party. She looked at me like I was crazy and said, \u201cCome on, you always drive! Don\u2019t be a bitch.\u201d Which like, wtf? I tried to explain calmly that I wasn\u2019t being a bitch, just that I wasn\u2019t going to be the chauffeur anymore. Then, my aunt overheard and pulled me aside. She lectured me, saying, \u201cWe all agreed last year you\u2019d be driving. You know how much we rely on you. Everyone else is too tipsy, and Ubering is so unsafe. Just drive this one time, for the family.\u201d I felt a ton of pressure but refused I told her I\u2019m not their chaufeur and wasn\u2019t going to do it again just because no one else could figure out their own ride. My aunt got upset, saying I was being selfish and that we\u2019re family. She said I\u2019m the only one who doesn\u2019t get \u2018too drunk,\u2019 so it makes sense for me to help out. I told her I had already had three beers, so I wasn\u2019t even legally supposed to drive myself. That\u2019s when I snapped. I told them it\u2019s not my job to be their DD every year just because I\u2019m the only one who doesn\u2019t get blackout drunk. They needed to figure out their own rides this time. Then I got up and left. I felt bad walking out, but I didn\u2019t want to be a doormat anymore. I spent the rest of New Year\u2019s Eve at home, watching Netflix and eating leftover pasta with my boyfriend. My family texted me, calling me dramatic, selfish, and saying I ruined the night. They said I was being \u201csuper sensitive\u201d and that everyone was \u201cdisapointed\u201d in me. Everyone's demanding an apology out of me even now.

A few weeks ago, he told me he had a \u201cgroundbreaking\u201d idea that would \u201cchange humanity forever.\u201d Entertaining him, I asked what it was. His answer? He wants to invent a new color. Before we go any further it\u2019s important to note we are both college graduates. I graduated in Biochemistry last year and my boyfriend in Philosophy a few years before, which makes this all the wilder I guess. I tried to gently point out that colors exist as part of the visible spectrum of light, so unless he was about to discover some new wavelength, this might not be possible. But he waved me off, calling me \u201cclose-minded\u201d and saying he was \u201cenlightened in a way you\u2019ll never be\u201d At first, I just nodded and let him ramble about his \u201cvision.\u201d But then he told me he needed funding to start his \u201cresearch.\u201d Specifically, he wanted me to give him $4,000 so he could buy \u201csupplies,\u201d including \u201cadvanced art tools,\u201d a lab coat (because apparently, scientists wear them, so it would make him \u201cfeel smarter\u201d), and\u2014wait for it\u2014a trip to the desert because he thinks the \u201cpure sunlight\u201d there will inspire him. I told him absolutely not. I\u2019m saving for grad school, and even if I weren\u2019t, I\u2019m not dropping thousands of dollars on his\u2026 whatever this is. He got mad, saying I didn\u2019t believe in him or his \u201cpotential to revolutionize human perception.\u201d He even accused me of being jealous that he had a \u201cworld-changing idea\u201d and I didn\u2019t. It got really heated and he ended up saying a lot of things about using my card as he knew the details anyway. For reference he\u2019s been unemployed for a while now, whilst I\u2019ve got a regular job. I ended up saying some things I do regret, but a lot of it was retaliation. Now he\u2019s sulking and telling everyone I\u2019m \u201cunsupportive\u201d and \u201cafraid of innovation.\u201d His friends are backing him up, saying I should be encouraging his creativity instead of \u201ccrushing his dreams.\u201d AITA for refusing to fund his quest to invent a new color? EDIT: In terms of drugs we smoke weed occasionally but haven\u2019t in the past few weeks, I\u2019ve never seen him do any other drugs nor have I found any in the house. So I don\u2019t know if I can really blame this on a bad trip  SECOND EDIT: Thankyou guys for all the advice, I\u2019ve moved the majority of my money into my second bank account for now which I\u2019m pretty sure he doesn\u2019t have access to. In terms of his mental health I\u2019m not in the habit of sharing his personal history online but seeing all your comments I do agree that this might be a mental health issue and I\u2019m going to attempt to approach him with the idea of a consultation tomorrow, if anyone has any advice on that please let me know as I don\u2019t want it to come across as insulting, I know he was down after his job but the comments have got me more worried about more serious illnesses that he may have.

        "selftext": "I joined a Women\u2019s Social Club 6 months ago because I\u2019ve been struggling to make friends after relocating to a new-to-me city. It took me a while to warm up to the group and to connect with people I actually had anything in common with. I had to wade through a lot of botox parties and boozy brunches to find things I was interested in. But I did, and I started coming to group events fairly often. I hang out most often with the women who like to read, do crafty things, bake, skywatch, etc. Among these women is one, I\u2019ll call her Andea, who has made several comments about how she\u2019s a total klepto. I think that she makes these comments to seem \u201ccool\u201d to the other people in the group. I reached out to some of the women I see regularly at these events and invited them over to my place to watch a TV show we\u2019d been talking about and do crafty stuff. They were excited and agreed to come. Unfortunately, Andrea found out (I assume someone asked if she was going) and reached out to me to ask if she was invited. I considered this for a bit and then told her no, as I only had so much room at home. She didn\u2019t believe me and asked me for the real reason, saying \u201cI thought we got along\u201d which yes, is true.\u00a0 I told her I\u2019m not comfortable inviting a kleptomaniac into my home. That I\u2019ve worked hard to have the things I have and it would be stupid for me to invite her knowing that she openly brags about it.\u00a0 She said \u2018Okay\u2019 very quietly. She then said \u201cYou\u2019re painting me out to be some horrible criminal when you don\u2019t even know anything about me.\u201d\u00a0 I said that her being proud to call herself a klepto was all I needed to know. She said that I was a high school mean girl and ableist. I am unsure what the foundation for that statement is. This unfortunately has spilled over to the group, which is frustrating. But what has me the most surprised is that there are so many people defending her and telling me that I\u2019m out of touch and take things too literally. Am I?",

When we got back, I noticed she had used most of my shampoo and conditioner without asking. I had splurged on these expensive products to treat myself. I also make a lot less money than my friend. Today, Sarah came over again for a visit and asked to shower at ours before heading to a dance class. However, I had taken my expensive products to my room this time, leaving only my friend\u2019s basic shampoo out for her to use. When she couldn\u2019t find the conditioner, she asked my friend, who came to my room to ask me about it. I told him that she\u2019s his guest, and it\u2019s not my responsibility to provide spa products for her. My friend got mad and thinks I\u2019m rude and petty. AITA? UPDATE: I showed my friend where to buy the shampoo and conditioner, he said he\u2019s sorry for getting angry and ordered new bottles for everyone to use. Thanks for all the NTA comments!!",

        "selftext": " (As a disclaimer, I have nothing against colored hair or people who choose to color their hair. My hair was bright green as a teenager, LOL.) My daughter Alexis (not her real name) is 15. She has been dancing recreationally since she was 3 years old and has been doing competitive dance since she was 9 years old. She has nationals coming up, which is basically a very big and important dance comp where studios from surrounding states come to this big convention center in the city and compete. She is also obsessed with Paramore, thanks to my husband who has taken her to many of their live shows. She idolizes Hayley Williams and has wanted to dye her hair like Hayley\u2019s for a few years now. This year for her birthday, she wants to dye her whole head neon orange. I told her absolutely not because she\u2019s not allowed to hair any unnatural hair colors for nationals and other conventions/comps that are coming up. She is very well aware of this rule because it is the standard in the competitive dance world. I\u2019ve already paid all of the entry fees and cannot get a refund for this year. I told her that once nationals and all the mandatory conventions are over, she can color her hair however she wants. She did not like this answer and stomped off to her room. I figured I would just let her be and eventually she would come around. I was wrong. She went to a sleepover at her friend\u2019s house about a week ago and came back with the same bright orange hair I told her she could not have. I was cooking when she walked into the house and nearly dropped the knife I was using. I was extremely upset and asked her what she was thinking. She gave me some excuse which I can\u2019t remember, then rolled her eyes and said something along the lines of \u201cit\u2019s just hair dye, it\u2019ll come out before nationals\u201d. I was livid, and shouted at her (which I\u2019ll admit I\u2019m not proud of) and she ran off to her room in tears. She knows better, and I\u2019m completely dumbfounded as to why she thought it would be okay considering nationals is in two weeks. She\u2019s washed her hair at least 6 times in the last few days and the orange is still stuck. I bought color remover and let it sit on her hair for a good 2 hours, and nothing. I\u2019m so pissed because now I\u2019m going to have to take her to the salon and spend 300+ dollars to get this color removed when I\u2019m already over 400 dollars deep in the hole after the fees for the competition. My daughter is currently grounded, still upset with me and hasn\u2019t spoken more than a few words to me in days. She cried to my husband after I shouted at her and now he thinks I\u2019m being unreasonable and called me \u201cmomzilla\u201d. Am I being crazy about this??! She knew the rules and I even told her she could do the hair dye after we get this over with. If this color doesn\u2019t come out, she literally won\u2019t be able to compete and I\u2019ll have wasted over 400 dollars.  Edit: Looking at some of these comments, I just want to clarify that when I asked Alexis if she wanted to compete, she was very enthusiastic and told me yes. She has done nationals every year for a fee years now and has loved it every time she has done it. I am very clear with her that since it is optional, she has the choice whether or not she wants to still participate and I am not forcing her in any way to do it. I am upset because she told me she wanted to do it, I paid the fees and now we can\u2019t back out of it but also she will NOT be bale to compete if the orange doesn\u2019t come out. Update: Hello all, thank you for the insight. I was really thinking about it last night and realized shouting at her and grounding her was not an adult way of handling things. I apologized to her and when we sat down for breakfast this morning and had a heart to heart conversation, in which we discussed the options she currently has. I calmly explained to her why what she did upset me and why I reacted the way that I did. She apologized to me for going behind my back after I put a boundary in place. For those saying it\u2019s not a big deal and it\u2019s \u201cjust hair\u201d you\u2019re right. It is just hair. It\u2019s not the orange hair that actually upsets me. It\u2019s the fact that she did it after I told her to wait because of the money I spent so she could be able to compete. I also asked her if being on the competitive team/doing dance in general is still something she truly wants to do, as some of you suggested. She opened up to me and said that while she loves it, she\u2019s exhausted and mentally drained during comp season and after. Part of the reason why she did the orange hair was because she thought she could get out of this one thing. There is still a lot of ground to cover and other things that need figured out, but I told her she does not have to compete any more if she doesn\u2019t want to and can just take her regular classes. She is still going to do nationals, but everything after that is up to her. Also for those saying I am limiting her freedom of self expression and trying to control what she does with her body: just no. Not once have I ever tried to force my opinions or values onto her because it\u2019s what I think is morally correct. I am an avid supporter of her expressing herself however she wants\u2026whether it be through her style, her hair, the music she listens to, etc. I will support her through every stage in her life no matter what she aligns herself with. I\u2019m not against the orange hair; I\u2019m all for it, just not right at this very moment. In no way do I want to prohibit her creativity or self expression. I set boundaries for her with a compromise which I expected her to follow through with. From one mother to\u2014I\u2019m sure the many others that have seen this\u2014how can we expect our kids to grow up to be well rounded adults if we don\u2019t set boundaries for them and occasionally limitations? Alexis is ungrounded, but not out of trouble. Her and I are going to brainstorm a different, more fitting way for her to learn from this. She is going to pay for a wig with money she earned from babysitting her cousins. I texted her dance instructor to let her know what we are doing and so the approval of her wearing the wig to the comp is TBD until it arrives. If not, she will be responsible for finding out another way to cover up the orange. For those who suggested box dye\u2014putting box dye on my daughter\u2019s hair will be the absolute last resort. I understand that she needs a fitting punishment and having to live with a muddy hair color from putting it over the orange will probably fit the crime, but I do not want her to be miserable for an unnecessarily extended period of time after the dance thing is over and after the situation has been dwelled on enough. Alexis doesn\u2019t want to put box dye on her hair either, but she said that if she has no other choice, then she\u2019s okay with that. I told her that if we DO end up having to put box color over it, that she is going to have to live with it until it grows out enough to cut it off or she will have to pay her color correcting service.",

        "selftext": "Two years ago I saw an original watercolor piece that I liked and I contacted the artist and bought it. When the piece arrived I sought a frame for it, but I hadn\u2019t been able to find a frame for that size every time I went to the store. They were all too big or too small. So I just kept the piece in an envelope in my desk, I would sometimes look at it, remember I had to find a frame for it but would later forget again. Work, family and life leaves little time to devote to thinking about a frame for a painting and I don\u2019t have any framing businesses near me, so that wasn\u2019t either an option. Today my boyfriend is dusting and comes out of the office showing me the painting on a spare frame he had been using for something else. I ask him if that frame is 9x12. He tells me it\u2019s 8x10, that he had to cut a piece of the artwork to make it fit. When I look at it the piece went from a centralized composition to having the composition indented to the left side because he cut all whole inch on that side to save the artist\u2019s signature which was on the extreme opposite end (for reference, imagine I if you cut the Mona Lisa to the point where her head is no longer in the center). When he notices I\u2019m perplexed he nonchalantly tells me that the painting was in an envelope anyway, and it\u2019s better if it\u2019s out so we can see it. I get mad because this is not the first time he has taken something of mine and given it away, offer it to someone or just not ask and do whatever he wants with it. His mother does the same thing with his things at her house. In their family if you\u2019re not using something anyone can do with it as they please. I explained to him in my family you don\u2019t do anything with other people\u2019s stuff I have a tendency to ruminate on thoughts, so I try not to engage in negative emotions because then I just can\u2019t let go of them and I cycle and cycle through them and it makes my life miserable, and I have to devote a lot of energy to get me back to normal. Every time I looked at the framed painting I felt a new wave of sadness, anger and frustration ripple over me. So I took the frame down, took the painting out of it, ripped it into four pieces and threw it in the garbage. When my boyfriend saw it he was shocked and visibly hurt. I get that his intentions were good, but he ruined a piece of art that was not his to begin with. Now it\u2019s awkward at home because I\u2019m still fuming and he\u2019s sad. AITAH",

During the day I work out of a spare room and he works out of the living room, so during work hours these two spaces essentially work as two offices. I will refer to the room I work in as my office for simplicity sakes but it is not the exclusive use of that room and there is a second bathroom that can only be accessed through the spare room. I scare extremely easily. I usually keep the door open unless one of us is on a call, but very frequently my husband will walk into the room and scare me really badly. Like I'll *scream* and jump and for a few seconds I genuinely cannot control my reaction, like I feel like I almost white out for a second sometime it scares me so bad. I dont handle it very well, a good scare will leave me shaking for hours after. I know I'm very weak to being scared and that its an unreasonable reaction but I genuinely cannot control it. I have some trauma in my past that contributes, but I am working with a therapist. My partner takes a great deal of offence to my reactions, even though I try to explain I cant control them. Sometimes when he startles me like that I'll say something like Why did you do that? or why do you keep doing that? as a reaction and that hurts his feelings. I always apologize and try to assure him its not personal, its just what comes out of my mouth when I'm scared but I can tell it really bothers him. I've asked him to just pause and knock before he comes in but thats not really fair to make him stop and knock in his own house to enter a room that isnt exclusively for my use. The scares are bad enough that they can greatly impact my work day. I know this seems extreme, but a good scare makes me feel like my brain turns off for a while after until I get ahold of myself again. I suggested this morning, after a good scare, that maybe I should get a motion sensor door chime like they have at shops! I could install it in the hall just before my door and put the noise maker on my desk so that I'll hear the noise and know he's coming. My Partner thinks that thats over the top but I want to find a solution that will work. Would I be the asshole if I just bought a chime and set it up? edit: I'm reading everything as it comes in this is just a lot of messages thank you! edit2: sorry, I'm like, a little overwhelmed. A lot of people are saying he's doing it on purpose and I hadnt thought of that and I'm more than entertaining that idea. I'm gonna try my best to reply to comments, thank you Those curious about the Brad story it doesnt have an interesting conclusion but if enough people care I will post an FAQ over on ask reddit.",

        "selftext": "Last Thursday, my neighbors approached my wife regarding a Use of Yard waiver since they don\u2019t have the clearance to move excavators and bobcats to their backyard to build a pool. The waiver states they need 10ft of clearance (4ft would be into our yard based on my measurements) and they would repair the grass to its original state. I have an irrigation system and internet lines which run beneath the area which would be used. The neighbors were leaving for FL and asked for a 48 hour turnaround. I spoke to the pool company on Friday and the PM said they need 10-12ft and they need the waiver because there is a good chance the ground will be totally torn up. It was my wife\u2019s 30th birthday this weekend so this situation was not top of mind but my neighbor knocks on the door Saturday afternoon asking for a response. I kindly explain I am not comfortable signing the current waiver given the typos, lack of notarization, and ambiguities regarding repairs. He takes it personally and storms out of the house complaining about how much money he is going to lose. Today, the project manager from the pool company knocks on our door asking what they can do to resolve this. I told him I really don\u2019t want my yard torn up but at minimum a new waiver needs drafted and I would consider it. He then says we have an electrical easement which runs 1.5ft into our yard in the exact spot he wants to use and would just call for access. I check my plat design and deed to see there is NOT any easement running thru the area they need. He leaves and the situation is still up in the air. Edit: thanks everyone for your input. I had run this situation by many friends and colleagues and the answers were consistently \u201cno\u201d unless you can get outrageous stipulations and even so it is still a risk. At the end of the day, I don\u2019t want to be dealing with the pool contractor or neighbor to return my yard and irrigation to its original state.",

        "selftext": "My daughter, Rowan (11), recently hosted her very first sleepover. She invited her best friend, Amanda (almost 11), who lives just across the street and two houses down from us.  They did all the classic sleepover activities: pizza, popcorn, a movie, face masks, and nail polish. Everything was going perfectly\u2014until around 11 p.m. when Rowan came into our bedroom to let me know Amanda was homesick and wanted to go home. I went to check on Amanda, and while she assured me she was having fun, she really wanted her mom. Fair enough. I texted her mom, Susan, to let her know what was happening, and she said it was fine for Amanda to come home. So Amanda packed up her things, and I walked her to the porch. From there, I watched her walk the short distance to her house and go inside safely before heading back inside myself.  The next day, I ran into Susan while she was out walking in the neighborhood. I asked how Amanda was doing, and\u2026 well, Susan was furious. Apparently, Amanda had been upset about leaving early, but what really got Susan\u2019s blood boiling was that I didn\u2019t walk her to the door. She berated me for letting her child \u201cwalk home alone, at night, in the cold, with the potential of God-knows-what happening to her\u201d. For context, we live in a quiet cul-de-sac in a safe neighborhood. I stood on the porch the entire time and watched Amanda walk into her house before going inside. Amanda didn\u2019t seem scared or hesitant, and she never asked me to walk with her. To be honest, it didn\u2019t even occur to me that this would be an issue\u2014when I was a kid, I would walk all over by myself. Sure, I know times have changed, but I genuinely thought this was fine. Susan didn\u2019t see it that way. She\u2019s still furious and has been telling neighbors I put Amanda in danger. Despite my apologies to both her and Amanda, she\u2019s banned the girls from playing together. Now I\u2019m left wondering\u2014was I wrong not to walk Amanda to her front door? AITA? Thank you all for the support. Here\u2019s some additional context:That night, it was just Amanda staying over\u2014no other friends. I\u2019m married, and my husband was home. Susan is also married, but her husband travels often and happened to be out of town that night. She has another child, Matthew (5M). She told me that if I had let her know I wasn\u2019t planning to walk Amanda home, she would\u2019ve woken Matthew up and come to get her herself. One of the neighbors siding with Susan mentioned that I should have known how protective she is of her kids, especially since Amanda is typically a shy and fearful child. I\u2019ll admit, I did know this about Amanda, but my own kids are the total opposite, so it wasn\u2019t even on my radar to walk her all the way home. Maybe it should have been. If Amanda had asked me to walk her home I absolutely would have.  I can understand (to an extent) Susan being upset if she truly felt I put her child in a \u201cdangerous situation\u201d. I thought this would blow over after a couple of days, but this happened at the beginning of December. ",

        "selftext": "Hey yall. Throwaway so imma try to be quick with here.  I am 27 F and married my best friend 28 M about a month ago. One of my good friends is a wedding planner and I used her company for the coordinating. She was a guest at the wedding but had 3 other people from her company work with my husband and I. They were amazing. The whole wedding went perfectly. Not a single complaint about the job the company did. One of the assistants was this guy who looked to be about my age. I didn\u2019t give it much thought.  This past weekend, I hung out with my friend Clara (25 F). This is the first time we are seeing eachother since my wedding. Clara told me a \u201cfunny story\u201d about my wedding. She said a few days after my wedding she received an Instagram follow and message from someone she didn\u2019t know. The gist of the message was that it was from the assistant coordinator at my wedding.  He pretty much said that he was working and couldn\u2019t say anything but he noticed her at the wedding and thought she was really beautiful and he wanted to ask her on a date. She asked how he found her and he \u201cproudly\u201d said that he noticed her, looked up the seating chart of the table she was seated at for dinner, and looked up every girl at the table until he found her.  She said she wasn\u2019t comfortable with that and blocked him. She told me it was funny in hindsight but at the time she was a little uncomfy. Clara did emphasize to me she didn\u2019t think it was a big deal.  Would I be an asshole if I told my wedding planner friend about what happened? She will most likely report him to the head of the company and maybe he will or maybe he won\u2019t be fired. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m being vindictive or not. It doesn\u2019t sit right that we paid a guy to do a job and he ended up stalking and DMing my friend. ",

        "selftext": "I feel like this is kinda overreacting but maybe I\u2019m just wrong. My girlfriend\u2019s (26F) birthday was coming up and I wanted to get her something really nice. I\u2019ve noticed throughout our whole relationship that she does her makeup on the floor in front of a mirror and it always looks so uncomfortable. She has complained of it several times, so I decided it would be a great idea to get her a vanity set. I did some research and I found a couple she would like, but I knew she was picky and so I asked her if she was planning on buying a vanity set ever. She showed me the vanity set she wanted and I made sure to add that set to my Amazon list. A few months went by and I was ready to buy the set but I come to find out that it was sold out. I desperately looked at other sites and the manufacturer, but the set would not come for over a month after her birthday (keep in mind that I decided to buy it a month before, so it was not last minute). I still felt bad and so I decided to spend some more time researching what set to buy. I finally came across one that matched the style and color of other furniture that she had purchased and it was more expensive than the one she wanted so I bought it thinking she\u2019d like it even if it was the one she didn\u2019t ask for. I WAS WRONG. My girlfriend\u2019s birthday finally comes around and she goes off to her sisters while I spend 2 hours building this set right after work. When she finally comes home and I show it to her, I could clearly tell something was wrong. She was quiet and didn\u2019t seem too happy. She then started bawling her eyes out saying that she hates it because it wasn\u2019t the one she wanted. I explained to her that I couldn\u2019t get the one she wanted yet but if she didn\u2019t like it that much I could wait for it to come back and buy it and sell the one I just bought it. That only made her even more mad and upset. She then went on a rant about how she hates birthdays and that I shouldn\u2019t have gotten her anything. Again, this vanity set matches everything else she likes and it wasn\u2019t some cheap set. She told me to simply sell the set and keep the money because she does not want anything from me on her birthday. AITA for getting her the wrong set?",

        "selftext": "Right now I feel bad about this situation while also feeling some resentment towards my family. My sister lives about 20 minutes from me, near our parents. There was a family emergency where she needed to meet my parents at the hospital, and taking her kids wasn\u2019t an option. She called me up at 6:45 PM on her way to my apartment to tell me she needed to drop off the kids quickly and run. I tried to tell her that I was not in the right condition for that. She told me it was an emergency and she had no other option. I begged her to call her mother in law. She said that wouldn\u2019t work. When she showed up, she stepped inside my apartment to hand off her kids. Like I told her, I wasn\u2019t in condition for this. My friend and I had been celebrating her new job. My sister was shocked and disgusted and dragged her kids off, but not before telling me what a pathetic loser she thinks I am. She ended up texting me a novel about how disappointed she is, how upsetting it is for her kids to have walked into my apartment reeking of weed, how I\u2019m 27 and should be over that phase of my life, etc. She ripped into me for still living with 5 roommates, not having a car, all this other stuff. It was deeply hurtful and I just apologized for not being able to help her and the kids. Of course I had no idea there could be an emergency like this, but you never know. That\u2019s why it\u2019s an emergency. Yes I live with 5 people but they are my friends and we need each other to afford living here. I don\u2019t have a car because I can\u2019t drive. Weed is legal here and it's not a crime to smoke once in a while. My sister said she was so disgusted with me that she brought my parents into it. They have all banded together to let me know what a piece of shit I am for not living up to anyone\u2019s expectations. I do feel a little bit defensive because I had no way of knowing this would happen. So I guess my question boils down to am I the asshole because I was not ready for an emergency at my big age of 27? Did I really let my family down? Ok I got the post to let me edit it and someone told me to add that the reason I can't drive is because I medically can't drive (and never can, for my whole entire life sadly). ",

        "selftext": "When I was 17 my mom came into money.  She tried to keep it quiet but she paid off my dad\u2019s debts, bought him a small house, paid off her debts and paid for my sister\u2019s college and set up funds for mine.  She had a boyfriend at the time and shortly after him and his son who was 7 moved into our new house. Over the next few years mom bought my sister a house after she graduated college. Her boyfriend lived with us and didn\u2019t pay anything but he did work. When I was 21 mom got diagnosed with cancer. It wasn\u2019t good. She sat me and my sister down and went over exactly how much money there was. She intended to give her current house to me and both me and my sister were left with a large sum at the end of it.  She asked if I would allow her boyfriend to stay in the house with his son until he got his own place. I agreed. Before she died she told her boyfriend he would need to look for his own place but had time to save more for that journey. For the last 4 years he has continued to reside in the house with his son. I haven\u2019t minded because we get along okay. I pay all the bills but he does buy food for him and his kid. He has dated off and on and mostly kept the women out of this house which I respected him for.  Until his current partner.  She\u2019s been in my house 3 times and at first besides feeling a little uncomfortable I was okay with her. The last time this past weekend was the point where I lost my shit. I was making myself some lunch when she came walking downstairs. She grabbed a plate and went to grab food out of my pan. I asked her what she thought was doing. She started telling me how I should look for somewhere else to live and leeching off my dead mom\u2019s past relationship as an adult was pathetic. I hollered for my mom\u2019s old boyfriend he came down and I told him I didn\u2019t know what he current thing thought but I wasn\u2019t going to be disrespected in my house.  He wouldn\u2019t even look me in the eyes as he mumbled something about my mom promising him the house and he was just \u201cbeing kind\u201d letting me stay. First that isn\u2019t remotely true. Mom pulled him and i together after she asked if he could stay to set expectations. My mom met him shortly before she won the money and told him and us girls that she had no intention of leaving him money. She did set aside a fund for his son for college when he gets there but he cannot touch it, only his son can.  He has lived in this house almost 8 years without paying a dime he should have plenty of money and if he doesn\u2019t that\u2019s on him. I told him he had 30 days to leave. I wasn\u2019t going to house someone who would lie and disrespect me in my house. He left that night with his son but his ex wife called to tell me I am cruel and an AH for her son losing his house (he is here every other week). I really feel like my mom didn\u2019t expect him to still be here but my sister said she feels like I am breaking my promise to my mom and  that made me feel like maybe I am the AH.",

        "selftext": "Last September my uncle Daniel (43) came up to me (22) looking all stressed and asked if I could have a sit down with him as he needs a Favour. He begun to speak on how he was really on a rough financial spot, and he really had nowhere to turn to as he didn't have anyone to ask for a loan from and I was the only one left available.  Mind you I'm not rich or anything of the sort, I just happened to have the amount he needed at the time. According to him it was a serious situation that he couldn't approach or tell other guys in the family, and the issue needed to be addressed soon. Without better judgement I lent him the cash after much insisting from him. We agreed on payment before December, and I didn't even ask for any interest on it. With lots of hugs and words, he took it and gave me his word on the paying it. Fast forward and we are now at Christmas dinner at my grandma's house, and all that time I didn't give him any reminders or a checkup. I assumed he was late or something and he would let me know why at Christmas dinner because the larger family meets every year for that. He also didn't call or say anything to update on his situation and I just had to trust all was well. Now on a related side note for later, my cousin Aisha, (20, Daniel's daughter) recently underwent surgery a while back as she really had it tough for the whole of last year while she recovered from a traumatic back injury from an accident. Everyone was enjoying their meal and suddenly my uncle stood up at the dinner table and called for attention for a speech. He began to speak on how his business took a really huge boost and long story short, how he has just cashed in a large profit from some deals. He looked at Aisha across the table and took out some brochure with some resort looking location and said it was a gift to her for her tough recovery from the incident. All I could see was Aisha visibly crazy excited. Someone asked what it was exactly, and Daniel said he was planning on taking Aisha and the rest of his family to the Maldives as a celebration on Aisha's accident recovery. Everyone was now happily cheering Aisha on her gift as it seemed it was something she always wanted to experience. You can afford all that but not repay my debt which you haven't said anything on, the words just slipped out of my subconscious mind as I looked at him straight in the eye. His words were why are you talking about that now of all places. Now I was pissed, I reminded him Infront of everyone on the exact amount and I told him the fact on how he wasn't even communicating on repaying it. The entire family was in shock with dead silence as my mom hurriedly changed the subject to avoid an escalation of the situation. Later on, in the evening my aunt, grandma, and some cousins began to lecture me on how I ruined Aisha's moment after her struggles and embarrassed my uncle in the process. They leave in a week, and he still hasn't paid or mention anything on the debt. AITAH for ruining the moment and asking for repayment?

        "selftext": "Throwaway account. For the past 8 years, I (32M) have been paying my parents\u2019 property taxes and mortgage. They are retired and have very little retirement savings because they put all their money into my sister (29F) and I's education. We both went to top universities and found successful jobs afterwards. I felt like I owed my parents for all they sacrificed for me, so it was a no brainer to help them retire with no financial stress. My parents did not consult my sister about splitting these costs with me; instead, the agreement was that I would get a larger share of the house. Fast forward to now, my sister unfortunately lost her job last year and as a result, doesn't have much savings. She moved in with my parents to save money while she looks for a job. I recently found out that my sister pitched staying permanently in my parents' house, and my parents agreed. I was furious at this, because I had been paying for the house with the understanding that it would be sold and I would get a larger share. It is very likely my sister never sells the house and instead raises her eventual family there. Because the original agreement with my parents changed, I stopped paying for the mortgage, leaving it up to my sister to take care of if she's taking over the house. My parents are furious with me, saying I'm too money-obsessed and should be continuing to help the family while my sister is in a tough spot still looking for a job. Instead, they are promising that eventually my sister will pay me out for my share of the house plus whatever else I contributed over 8 years. I turned that offer down because there's no real guarantee this will happen and I don't trust my sister to follow through financially. I may be the asshole for taking such a cynical stance and leaving my family in financial stress, but I feel like I was already burned once through verbal agreements and I don't want to get burned again. AITA? Edit: My sister is fully opposed to selling the house because of the sentimental value. I'm not on the deed because when you put someone else on the deed in CA, your house is re-assessed and it will double our current property tax. There are also some implications to my parents social security payments if I do so. I wish I got something in writing but i felt like an asshole asking for something like that from my family. It was naive of me to think that way ",

        "selftext": "Between Christmas and New Years, me (43m) and my wife (43f) went to hang out and drink at my sister in laws (32f) house while her husband (wife's brother) and son went away for a few nights. Basically a normal night, my wife and I went over to keep my sil company. Played board games, drank etc.... My sil is very proper, fashionable, basic white girl. Maybe 5'2 and 100lbs. Anyhoo, we're in the living room, my wife passes out on the couch so we decide to call it a night sleeping on the couch. My sil gets up to go to bed, a little wobbly but she goes into the bathroom and shuts the door. I play on my phone for about 45 minutes and I notice she's still in the bathroom. So I knock on the door with no response, I knock a few more times then open the door to look in. She's a naked pooper, she passed out while pooping apparently and fell off the toilet onto the floor. Somewhere in all that she puked all over herself. So I'm left with a completely naked woman covered in puke, poop and pee. I try to wake my wife up but she's out cold, I try to wake my sil up but she's out cold. So I grab a bunch of towels, just do a quick clean up. Get the heavy stuff off of her, clean up the floor and made her a bed of towels so she didn't have to sleep on the cold tile, propped her head on a folded towel as a pillow and used a giant fluffy towel as a blanket.  Here's why I'm told I'm an asshole. She was mad I let her lay in poop/puke all night. I should have picked her up and put her in the tub and bathed her. She was passed out drunk, I didn't think she wanted me touching her intimate areas. Where she replied that I have a wife and daughter, I've seen a vagina before and I've changed my daughter's diapers/baths so I know how to clean a vagina/butt/breast. She's only 100lbs so it would have been easy for me. My wife sides with me but the other women say that I should have cleaned her better. So am I an asshole? Would you want someone touching you while you're passed out?  ",

        "selftext": "My teenager turned 16 today. They are also autistic. This morning they came out complaining about a rash from shaving, stating that it hurt too much to have air blow on it or cloth against it & therefore they weren\u2019t going to school. I gave them a few hours & tried again. They still wouldn\u2019t go. Gave it a few more hours, same result. Now it\u2019s too late to go to school. So I told them to text their friends & tell them that the dinner party @ a midprice restaurant is off. Now they & their sibling (21) are calling me an asshole. I feel like if I let them have the dinner out tonight after they called out of school is rewarding a negative behavior. If they were diabetic & had to go to the ER because of a low blood sugar then were released I still wouldn\u2019t let them go out to a dinner. Not that they\u2019d feel up to it then I imagine. So is this just me being a good parent or me being an asshole? Edit: I\u2019m still going to give them their birthday card/gift tonight. I haven\u2019t decided if the makeup dinner would be here or @ the original restaurant on a later night. Edit 2: they used to chew the collars off of their school uniform shirts because they didn\u2019t like the feeling of the fabric against their neck. So when they showed me that they did indeed have a raised/red rash from shaving that was too painful for school I agreed to let them stay home. I gave them medicated creams/lotions for the rash. I checked in on them several times throughout the day to see if they were feeling better. If the rash is the reason that you are staying home from school @ 0830, 1100, & 1300 then it\u2019s also the reason that you aren\u2019t going out to dinner @ 1700.Clarification of edit 2: using the shirt collar chewing as an example of understanding that they do have sensory issues. The rash is not on the neck. & also showing that by offering to let them stay home/offering medications throughout the day to show that I understand that the sensory issues can lessen with a little time as could have the rash. Clarification 3: it is a known rule in our household that if one is \u201ctoo much\u201d of something to go to school that day then one is not allowed to do \u201cfun\u201d events the rest of that day. That expectation as a consequence was reiterated each time that they were checked on & asked about whether or not they wanted to go to school. To have to explicitly state that feels really weird.",

        "selftext": "This might be a bit long so I'll put a tl;dr at the end!  I (19f) have a brother (24m) that I'll call Liam. Earlier this year, he started dating a girl he met at his climbing class that I'll call Emma (26f). They've been together for 4 months and this weekend he decided to introduce her to us.  They arrived yesterday and are staying until tonight. She is a really nice person and we got along well. Then at one point my dad asked her what she did in life and she said she was a lawyer. I was super interested because I'm currently studying law and have wanted to be a lawyer since I was maybe 10, so I was very excited to ask her questions about it. I asked about cases that she had, how she studied to become a lawyer, what her days looked like and many more things. I might've been a little over enthusiastic and annoying but I didn't realize it at the time and was just excited to get to ask someone questions about my dream job.  But at one point she said something that seemed incoherent to me. The details might be long and boring but basically she just said something that isn't technically possible. So I was curious and a bit confused and I asked her how that was possible because I just thought she's the professional so she must know better than me. But as she tried to explain it she just said more incoherent and impossible things. It was kind of like if someone was quoting things from Grey's Anatomy to doctors if you see what I mean. So I asked more about it to understand and that's when she admitted that she wasn't actually a lawyer and worked at a bookstore.  She told us that she was very sorry for lying and then left the table and my brother followed her. My parents kind of scolded me for being so intrusive and when my brother came back he was a bit angry. He started telling me that I was wrong for interrogating her and that I made her uncomfortable, and that she had lied because she was embarrassed about her job and I just made her more embarrassed. Now he hasn't been talking to me since and neither has Emma.  I'm not sure I'm in the wrong here but they all seem to think so. I get that me asking questions was annoying and maybe a bit too much but I truly didn't have bad intentions I was just excited to be able to talk about it with someone. And also I don't understand how everyone is so okay with the fact that she lied to my brother for 4 months and then also lied to us. I get being embarrassed but I don't know it's still a bit weird to me. But I never meant to make her uncomfortable and I genuinely liked her. I don't see how I'm in the wrong but maybe I just can't see it so please tell me so that I can have another perspective. Tl;dr: We met my brother's girlfriend and she told us she was a lawyer so I asked her questions because I was interested. But she said some incoherent things and then admitted she was lying about her job. They blame me for asking too many questions. Edit: For everyone wondering if I'm on the spectrum or neurodivergent in any way, I haven't been diagnosed with anything but many doctors and teachers of mine have mentioned it to me. I can understand why but I don't want to self diagnose obviously. I haven't been able to get tested because my parents don't believe in that stuff but as soon as I'm fully independent (financially, and living on my own) I will get tested.",

Last week, I came home to find Muffin had somehow gotten in and destroyed a puzzle I had spent hours working on. Pieces were scattered everywhere, some were chewed up, and one was lost entirely. I was furious. I told Lily that Muffin needed to stay out of my room, and she agreed, but she also said Muffin felt bad and wanted to apologize. I laughed it off, assuming she was joking. The next day, I found a little note on my desk written in Lily\u2019s handwriting that said, 'I\u2019m sowwy \u2013 Muffin.' Along with it was a cat treat. I thought it was funny but didn\u2019t change my stance. Since then, Lily has been passive-aggressively saying things like, 'Muffin\u2019s just trying to make things right,' or 'You\u2019re holding a grudge against a cat.' She even suggested that I let Muffin into my room supervised so she can 'earn back my trust.' I told her no and that I wasn\u2019t interested in giving her cat another chance to destroy my stuff.

Uncle Henry was grateful for the fund but \u2018Uncle John\u2019 was quite upset, saying that she\u2019s their mom and should have left them something All three of them got suspicious and asked me if Grandma told me about this during one of the afternoons I spent at her place.

His family and friends act like I\u2019m responsible for his social calendar, which I didn\u2019t mind at first because I didn\u2019t have anything better to do but I\u2019m tired of being the one to have to say no to everything and it sucks having to deal with people trying to convince me to come to things when I know they only really care about my husband attending. I\u2019ve tried to get them to go to him directly but he just sends them back my way or ignores them so they come to me anyway. I\u2019ve spoken to him multiple times about not wanting to be responsible for \u2018our\u2019 social calendar and he acts like he gets it but then never responds to invites so nothing\u2019s changed. So I\u2019ve done something that you guys may or may not think is petty. My mother-in-law has asked for us to join monthly family dinners with her side of the family. I prefer her side of my husband\u2019s family but my husband is closer to his dad\u2019s side so we see them more. Usually, I wouldn\u2019t accept an invite like this without checking with my husband but since she asked him first and he ignored her I decided to accept on his behalf. The first dinner is on Sunday which is the day we were also supposed to have dinner with his grandfather on his dad\u2019s side but he never told me that was happening and neither did anyone else (his dad\u2019s side have a horrible habit of just assuming we\u2019ll be at something because they\u2019ve told us). Part of me thinks the dinner with his grandfather is a lie because I know he\u2019s been avoiding his half-brother like the plague since he keeps asking him for an investment and his stepsiblings will be there. My husband told me to cancel but I don\u2019t want to because my mother-in-law was so happy when I said yes. Also, his sister will be there and I haven\u2019t seen her in forever. I won\u2019t stop him from cancelling if he really wants to but he\u2019s turned this situation into a fight because I didn\u2019t ask him first and now I don\u2019t want to be the one to cancel. He\u2019s basically said if we go to the first one he expects me to tell my mother-in-law this won\u2019t be a regular thing but I think he should be the one to do that since I have no problem having dinner with them regularly.

        "selftext": "The recent family Christmas party was at my (22M) house this year and about 25 people showed up. The traditional game this year was White Elephant. My family plays the dice version with some house rules for context. - Anyone who doesn't have a gift by the end of the game will receive $10 as a gift. - Trading gifts is allowed only with the $10 consolation gift.  The game had a total of about 40 gifts; I ended the game with 4 gifts, and 4 family members ended with none. My gifts were: a space heater, windshield wipers, a 20-pound gummy bear, and a $50 Starbucks gift card. Of the 4 people without gifts, 3 of them got rejected meaning only one trade was made. My cousin (26F) ended with $50 worth of lottery tickets but assumed they'd be worth nothing and I don't go to Starbucks. We couldn't trade because of the rules above and argued that the gift cards and lottery tickets had a numerical value like the $10 gifts so they should be tradeable. The family agreed and more gift cards were exchanged.  Trading ended and people began using their gifts so I went to put my gifts back in my room and a quarter to scratch the 5 $10 tickets. I wasn't expecting to win anyway; as I thought that scratching the second about to move on to the third, I did a double take as I realized I'd won $25,000. For I second I thought they were fake but my Grandma (82F) who bought them wouldn't do that. I sat in my room for a bit and decided to keep quiet about it knowing how some family members might react. I thought about how to tell them throughout the party, when they asked I said no and that I threw them out.  The next day (the 29th), I asked my Mom (58F) to come with me to cash in the lottery ticket. She was surprised of course and told me that I needed to go to the Casino. My brother (28M) thought it was funny and tagged along. He proceeded to post snaps of me being handed $100 bills in the casino. Although I told him not to say anything because of the commotion it would cause and that I'd share some with the family, he posted it anyway.  An hour passes and I'm pulled into a group chat of people from the party plus family members that couldn't make it. I said I'd give everyone who came to the party $250 and thought I was being selfish. For 30ish people that attended that's $7,500 right there, I felt that was fair. Family members who weren't there argued that they shouldn't be excluded, others argued that $250 isn't enough if I have $25K. After about 30 minutes of arguing, I was pissed and gave up negotiating. I told everyone that I'm sorry that they're not happy with your WE gifts this year and that the rule was that all trades are final.  I kept all the money, put $15K in my savings, and invested the rest. Many of my family members are still upset with me even as far as calling me cruel and heartless. I told them that if $250 isn't enough from a $100 limit, they're the selfish ones.  AITA? *Note that no household or individual family member is struggling financially. ",

        "selftext": "For context : I had my first daughter during pandemic and lockdowns. Husband was working overseas and planned to come before delivery but due to Australian border being shut, he was unable to come and after a painful 1.5 years apart, we finally reunited and he got to hold our firstborn. I am pregnant again and have kept my pregnancy a secret from family and friends. Only my parents and in-laws know. My parents will be coming from overseas when I am 30 weeks to stay and support me in my delivery. Husband wants to go overseas to see his parents for 10 days but I don't want him to go. He says he won't be able to go this year once baby comes. But his parents are planning on visiting us once the baby is a couple of months old so he shall get to see them this year anyway. AITA if I don't want him to go? I will be 31 weeks pregnant but I feel after last time of missing pregnancy and delivery of our firstborn , it should be him not wanting to go instead of me having to ask. He says that even his mum is telling him not to come but he wishes to go.  Update : First, I would like to say thank you to each and everyone of you for reading and commenting on my post. It is my first ever Reddit post and I was not expecting it to gain so much traction. I was hoping to reply to each and every one of you but with pregnancy fatigue and no time with a toddler, I decided to post an update. I was going to post it yesterday because it would have been a happy update but after today, my whole world has gone upside down. So two nights ago, I had a bit of a cry. Husband came and sat next to me and asked what happened and I told him that even though I would be 7 months only, I still didn't want him to go. He assured me he wouldn't. He said he wasn't planning to anyway but he sees my point and my point was that even though I would have my parents and I had my parents with me last pregnancy and delivery, it would not be the same as having your own spouse. Since he agreed so quickly without me having to beg or explain, I quickly ended that discussion and we went to sleep happily. Before I fast forward to today morning I would like to add some background info : Ever since we got married 8 years ago, I have noticed him taking his phone to the toilet. I have expressed my disgust at it and asked him not to but he still does. I have asked him why it takes so long for him to do his business on the toilet and he says he suffers from constipation. I have told him to get it checked by a doctor but he won't and claims it's normal and runs in his family so I have given up. Since two years I have noticed he wakes up at 4 in the morning to spend an hour in the toilet. That's the time my daughter and I are fast asleep and he wakes up at 5 to go to work but some nights, I wake up to an empty bed and he is in toilet. I have never told him about this because then he will start hiding even more from me. I have tried snooping on his phone but he always has it locked with a pattern that even though he unlocks in front of me, he does it so quickly and it's a complicated pattern so I am unable to memorise it lol. He leaves his phone out (recently realised it's always on silent and with notifications muted) and sometimes hands me his phone, so I brushed off my fears that something could be happening. Post covid when we reunited, I felt that because we were apart, we would be closer than ever to make up for missed time but he felt distant and after an argument where I accused him of cheating, he handed me his phone to prove he wasn't. In front of him, I looked through his phone and the only thing I found was that his Google Chrome was open to an insta account. No dp, no posts, no following but he was following 40 female celebrities. I asked him about it and he shrugged and didn't find it odd like I did. I angrily asked if I opened a secret insta account and followed only male celebs, would he like it? He said he wouldn't mind. I told him I didn't like it and he got defensive that they are politicians, UFC fighters and of course Hollywood and Bollywood stars and he just follows them and that's not cheating. I didn't like it but had to leave it at that. Today morning, he woke up and unbeknownst to him, I was awake but had my eyes closed. He took his phone, and I opened my eyes and saw that he had tonnes of messages on his notification bar. When he clicked on it, it took him to threads (didn't know he was on threads, and I don't know if it took him to app or a Google Chrome tab) and he scrolled through messages. I don't know who it is or what the messages said. He tilted his phone away from me to scroll through the messages and a while later, went to the toilet most probably to respond.I wish I knew the tech to look through his phone because I always wonder how do other people catch their spouses when I can't even get through his phone because of the pattern locking etc. My heart has dropped that he might be cheating but I feel like I shall go crazy without proof. I don't know what to do. Also my phone has a numerical password that he knows and I don't mind because I have nothing to hide. Should I ask to check his phone again? I checked his account from my threads and he joined it last year September. Again, no profile pic or threads. It's like a ghost account. I feel sick that I am having a baby with him but he never acted fishy otherwise for me to suspect something could be happening. ",

        "selftext": "I (27f) have been best friends with Kira (27f) since we were little. We were neighbors, went to the same school, college, etc. She was my MoH when I married Rowan (28m), who we went to college with. At first, Kira had a big crush on him, but he started liking me. We slowly got closer and I started liking him too (this was after Kira had told me she'd gotten over it and was dating another guy). But I still felt really guilty and didn't want to date him if it would hurt Kira. I asked her multiple times if she was okay with it and she said she was, so I thought it was fine. Kira's been with her latest boyfriend, Adam (27m), for a year or so. However, over the last few months, she's been acting strange around Rowan. Whenever we'd be hanging out with the three of us, or even with Adam there, she'd always find some way to sit next to Rowan, laugh at everything he said, etc. I didn't think anything of it initially because I knew that's kind of her personality, and her and Rowan are friends. But then she started always asking me if Rowan was there before she came over and if I said no, she'd often suddenly say she couldn't come, though sometimes she would say that even if I said he was here. Rowan also told me about a comment she made to him once about how he was so patient for putting up with me being too tired to do anything with him now that I was pregnant, which I thought was weird. The odd behavior continued but tbh the pregnancy had been keeping me too exhausted to give it a lot more thought, and Rowan seemed as friendly with Kira as always. But two days ago, our mutual friend Shay threw a dinner party. Me and Rowan went, as did Kira and Adam. Kira got a bit tipsy, and she kept trying to sit with Rowan and touch him. He excused himself a few times but she kept finding him. I tried to get her off a few times, and I was getting mad because this was a new line she was crossing. She was slurring about how I stole Rowan from her. Thankfully Adam was too busy talking to Shay's husband to hear this, but he definitely saw Kira's actions. The next afternoon, I was at Shay's again with some friends when Kira showed up. She was crying about how Adam had broken up with her that day, saying he didn't think they were going to work out. Everyone was consoling her, but I was just kind of sitting there. I couldn't help but feel like she brought this upon herself. She asked me Aren't you going to say something? so I said Maybe Adam wouldn't have left you if you weren't trying to get with Rowan all the time. Some of our other friends were shocked to hear this and got mad at Kira. Some got angry with me, saying Kira was just really friendly with everyone and that was a horrible accusation to make. Kira was upset, saying she couldn't believe I thought that of her and maybe we really weren't that close. She left in tears and I left soon after too. Now I don't know, maybe I was wrong? Kira had been drinking at the dinner party and might not have meant what she said, and the other stuff could've been nothing. Maybe this was too harsh to say to her after a breakup and we could've talked privately, not in front of our friends. AITA?",

        "selftext": "I kicked them out because they refused to take off their shoes as it's a celebration at our house.  For backstory, it was my daughter's first birthday. My partner is white and I am asian. It has been the norm in our household to keep shoes off when we're at home and we also wear indoor footwear/slippers. I have always kept spa slippers for guests in variety of sizes in case some are not comfortable in going barefoot. I have always kept my house clean  and have always maintained outdoor shoes/footwear off when inside our house. Not only does it makes cleaning floors easy, the thought of carrying germs inside is gross and scary to me. It's also a cultural norm for us as well to keep shoes off as a sign of respect to the owners of the house.Now my daughter's birthday has come. The first few guests have arrived and has taken cue that shoes should be off and I've offered spa slippers and some were happy to wear them and some just went barefoot inside.  Now my partner's dad and his fiance arrived along with their children (His parents are divorced). And they went straight in with their filthy shoes on. Like really gross looking shoes, that were not clean looking and you can see the dirt sticking to my tiles. I told my partner to tell them to take off shoes please because the other guests were happy to comply and thought they would do the same. Well they didn't do that and just kept walking around inside with the shoes on and stepping on the rugs and mats with it. I politely asked again, but his dad grunted and said our shoes are clean, we always wash them weeklyI pointed out the dirt on the floor and he said it's the dirt from when they walk on our front yard so its mainly part of our house. I explained again that kids and most especially his grandchild crawls around our floor and since it's her birthday to just take their shoes off the mat where she crawls.This time he seems offended and started with why I am making such a big deal out of wearing shoes inside when it's a party anyway and I'm ruining such an important day because I could not bend a little rule for one day. And it's white people culture to not take their shoes off anyway. That's when I lost it and said they can get out of my house if they can't do a simple request.And they left and my partner said I should've just let it go since they travelled quite far to come for our daughter's birthday and I'm an asshole for not being considerate for only one day. So AITA? Wow this got so much attention and I'm showing this to my partner! Posted this on comments: Before having our baby, when they used to visit they know we have a shoes off rule at our old apartment. My partner has always pointed this out to them but I would not make a fuss because they only see us on occasion - like maybe once/twice a year. This time though, we moved to a bigger house and I have a one year old that crawls around and it's mainly because there are other babies and kids too especially in the play area. I was adjusting to the thought that they can wear shoes then on other areas of the house except on her playmat (it's a very large foamy/soft playmat that covers most of the room) but they didn't want to follow on that either. Even their children hasn't taken off their shoes when they started to hung out with the other kids to play and that's where the blow-up happened. He wanted to hand my daughter their gift in the playroom when we also have a designated area to put the gifts. And people commenting about the slippers: they are those disposable spa slippers(bought off at amazon like $10 for 20pcs) that I threw out once used except for my usual guests which are my close friends who now has their own slippers marked in my house.

        "selftext": "My husband is a nice guy, but sometimes he doesn\u2019t listen to me and that really triggers me if he does it frequently enough. For example, he will ask if i want some oranges, i\u2019ll say no thank you, then he\u2019ll peel some oranges for me and offer me some, and then i\u2019ll say no thank you, and he leaves the bowl of oranges there. But imagine this happens for multiple scenarios daily. 95% of our fights is because he does not listen to me, and thinks he knows better and keeps insisting and imposing his ideas on me. Today, i was holding our baby daughter (2 months) and eating. He told me to eat first and he will hold our daughter. I told him, I\u2019m fine, it\u2019s finger food and I got it. I told him to eat first and then rear the toddler/baby after. Well he insisted I should eat first and told me to give him the baby. I told him again, NO i\u2019m ok, i can hold the baby. He then came over and grabbed the baby and repeatedly said \u201ceat! Eat first! I\u2019ll eat after\u201d. I told him explicitly, \u201cNO, let go. No i\u2019m fine. No don\u2019t take her. you aren\u2019t listening to me and this WILL lead to a fight, this is disrespectful, please stop\u201d while maintaining my hold on our baby. He kept grabbing the baby from my arms and I finally let go because i didn\u2019t want to make our baby feel uncomfortable or worse hurt her (like god forbid we drop her while both trying to grab her). I was so pissed off he would not listen to me again and went as far as \u201cstarting a tug a war\u201d with our baby.  He says he\u2019s always trying to just be nice and I end up snapping at him. It\u2019s also important to know what we value the most in relationship is different. He values feeling like he\u2019s cared for and loved. I value being respected. I told him by not listening to me repeatedly (multiple times a week), he\u2019s disrespecting me. So now I feel crazy. I know he's trying to be nice but I end up a fight about how he doesn't listen to me at least twice a month. Edit: no, i don't think this is abusive because it's a learned behavior. He does this with his mom (and vice versa). And after his mom gives in, she laughs and says aww my son is so filial. Apparently they enjoy this. Fml. This behavior has exponentially gotten worse since his mom moved in (which is a totally different issue)",

We\u2019re planning family vacation and discussing sleeping situations & cost for the cabin we\u2019ll share this summer. I would have to share a room with my parents. I don\u2019t really mind sharing but would love to have my own space. Unfortunately, that isn\u2019t possible where we vacation. Cost is cabin + pet fee, divided by couple but they want me to pay the same amount they are paying.  Considering it\u2019s just me and I won\u2019t have my own space for my only vacation of the year, I don\u2019t think I should have to pay the same amount as everyone else. I could go have a quiet vacation solo for the same price. They\u2019ll also calculate food cost and divide it evenly. I\u2019m truly not asking for a big discount lol.  Most of my family isn\u2019t chiming in but a couple of them are saying \u201cthat\u2019s not how it works in the real world\u201d when I\u2019ve said I don\u2019t believe that\u2019s fair.  Am I the asshole for telling them I don\u2019t want to go? More context: I work with kids and do not get PTO. I have chronic pain & get overstimulated quickly so I\u2019m always disappearing for a bit to reset myself mentally during family functions. I\u2019m also the only person that doesn\u2019t drink and am kind of an outsider in my family because of that and political views so there tends to be a lot of what feels like them ganging up on me. I\u2019ve been told \u201cwe do it every day, it\u2019s your turn\u201d in regards to taking care of the kids numerous times at gatherings. My response is always that I would have kids if I wanted to do it every day. They seem to think I don\u2019t deserve to relax because I\u2019ve decided not to have children. I hate missing out on time with the kids but know I would 100% end up taking care of them (all under 3yo) while the rest of the adults drink and it wouldn\u2019t be much of a vacation for me. I didn\u2019t go last year for this reason. ",

        "selftext": "I (M28) live with my twin brother (M28) and have for a few years. Our dynamic is typically fine but he\u2019ll take advantage of me at times, like playing my PlayStation when he didn\u2019t ask, and taking various things out of my room without asking. (He\u2019ll give them back after I have to ask) I have weather related allergies and take a loratadine pill as needed. A few months ago, I bought a bottle of 90 pills for a total of $36 from a local drug store.  I don\u2019t take them every day and there\u2019s 90 in the bottle so it\u2019s hard to keep track of them. A few months ago though I did notice that the bottle seems to be getting emptier despite me not taking a pill every day. I thought that was a little odd but didn\u2019t really think anything else of it. But then just about a month ago, I noticed it significantly more empty than before. So I decided to count them and found there were about 15 pills or so in the bottle.  Fast forward to last night, I wanted to take a pill, so I opened the bottle and noticed there was 1 pill left. I immediately suspected my brother of taking them, without asking obviously.  So I confronted him about it.  He admitted to taking them, but he questioned how many I think he took. I said I obviously didn\u2019t have a clue but it seems like it\u2019s been happening for months. He got incredibly defensive and said \u201cbro it\u2019s just loratadine. It\u2019s a fucking allergy pill, not money, not a prescription.\u201d  I said that it\u2019s the principle, it doesn\u2019t matter what it is, you don\u2019t steal.  I then demanded he replace the product. To go CVSs website and order the exact bottle, because it\u2019s a 1 for 1 comp. That\u2019s the price I paid for the product. He thought that was absolutely ridiculous, because he can get a bottle of like 300 pills on Amazon for like $15, instead of 90 for $36. Is it more expensive? Yes. But that\u2019s the price I paid, despite it being cheaper elsewhere. He wouldn\u2019t budge. He said I\u2019m ordering you this or nothing at all. He called me an asshole for demanding this but he doesn\u2019t see it that way at all.  So, Reddit. What are your thoughts? AITAH?",

        "selftext": "Hey everyone ! So, I know the title is awful, but that's literally what went on. For a bit of context, I (M22) have been dating my boyfriend Marc (M27) for two years. He has a daughter Lily, (F7), which is important for the story. I met my Marc five years ago, when I began babysitting his daughter while he worked, (single dad, mom is deceased), and since Lily and I got along great, I became the sole babysitter when he needed. It was practical because we were living two streets apart, and just overall the best choice because I was available, liked them and they liked me. But eventually, him and I fell in love, and I quickly moved in with him and his daughter, to whom I became a second dad.   But here's the core of the problem, my sister (F35) is married to my BIL (M33), so every family gathering, I see him. He's relatively a nice guy, though we're not friends, but he never met Marc. When I started dating Marc, he didn't want to come to my family gatherings at first, because he's not comfortable around people, he's a shy guy, and of course I understood that. But last week, it was my mom's birthday, and she really wanted him and our daughter to be there, so he finally accepted. When my sister and my BIL found out he would be there, they were mad at me, and I didn't understood why at first, until she took me apart and called me insensitive and egoistic toward my BIL for inviting him, even though I had no idea why it made him uncomfortable. Apparently, when he was young, his parents divorced because his dad cheated with his babysitter, and it caused him a traumatism. I told her it was bullshit, that my boyfriend was part of my life, part of my family and I wouldn't exclude him because her husband was uncomfortable. I also reminded her that there was no cheating, no breaking of trust or anything in my relationship with Marc, but she just called me insensitive again and left. My mom's birthday party was two days ago, and my family loved Marc and Lily. But all day, my sister and BIL kept glaring at us and muttering insults or mean comments under their breath. They brought it up again after dinner, but directly to my boyfriend and our daughter this time, telling her that your dad and his boyfriend are disgusting freaks or that he's a cheater who doesn't care about your dead mom. Obviously, my boyfriend and I absolutely lost it against them. Knowing my boyfriend's temper, I told him to take our daughter to the car while I was ripping a new one to my sister. We left shortly after, after apologizing to my mom for the mess it caused.   Now, my family's group chat is divided, mostly everyone is on our side, but a few of my extended relatives are on my sister/BIL's side, saying that we went too far, and should've just ignore them or went back home. Now, I know that my mom asked for them to come, but I'm feeling really guilty that it ruined her birthday's to have this drama. So, AITA?",

        "selftext": "My boyfriend (26m) and I (26f) have been together for about 8 months. We live together but have split financials. I worked hard and went to college, which is why I have a well paid job. When I met my boyfriend he didn't have a serious job, but he worked hard so we could live together and he now has a job with a decent income. He makes less than me and the rent etc. are divided pro rata. I paid for the first month of our rent (alone) and for our holidays and he still has to pay me back, but there's no rush as I don't need the money right away. We really love gaming together. He plays on his ps4 and I play on my nintendo switch. He mentioned he would like to buy a ps5 together so we can ditch the switch, because it's lagging alot. We did not talk about who would play on the ps4 and who would play on the ps5, but the costs would be split in half. I also said I would love to have a ps5, since I play on the switch and it sucks. My boyfriend does not have enough money and still had to pay me back for the vacation, so we dropped the subject. But since we've been gaming alot, my switch is starting to annoy me. The console is slow and it does not have enough capacity to load my games. That's why I decided to buy a ps5. I have more than enough savings to do so. I texted my boyfriend I wanted to buy a ps5 later that day and I did. Now my boyfriend's annoyed cause he wanted to buy a ps5 together. It would take some months before he would have enough savings, which is why I bought it myself. He also asked if the ps5 belonged to the both of us or just me. I responded that the ps5 is just mine untill he pays half of it, but he can always play on it if I'm not home. He got upset by this and said he was dissapointed.

My side of the family is huge, lots of siblings and kids. I have always, ALWAYS offered up my event hall and planning for their use even though it comes at a cost for my business.  My niece (now 25f), we can call her Mary, has taken me up on that three times in the past - for her post-elopement party and two baby showers. For each of those she gave me no directions, just said do whatever you want. So I did, trying to keep her in mind.  At her first baby shower she turned up 30 minutes late in raggedy sweats, stayed long enough to eat and gather up the presents, then left. No thank-yous offered. My brother and SIL (her parents) made excuses, saying the pregnancy was very rough. So we made allowances for that. At her post-elopement dinner she again showed up late, stayed on her phone the whole time, ate and left. Again, no thank yous. When my mother commented on that, my brother said she was going through some newlywed stress as an excuse. Her second baby shower started the same way. When she asked me to gather up all the presents so she could leave, I suggested she stay and open them so everyone could enjoy seeing what was given. She scoffed and said, I don't want to stay at these little parties any longer than I have to. So I gathered up the presents and decided not to offer my little parties to her in the future. Fast forward to her sister's wedding shower. We have a delightful time, even though Mary has done the usual eat-then-leave without offering to help or just be there for her sister. My brother and I are loading up the presents when he mentions that Mary is expecting again and when can I host the shower. I told him I wouldn't be offering this time around and why. He was taken aback and said that he was surprised I was letting that comment get under my skin but whatever, my choice.  The next day I get an irate call from Mary. I remind her that she said she didn't care for my parties so why does she want it anyway? It turns out she got rid of all her baby supplies and needed a shower to get the presents. I told her to post her registry online and I'm sure people would help her out. She got angry and hung up. Then my brother calls. He says I'm being childish. I told him that if he wants the shower he can pay for it, and gave him the standard quote for that event cost. He just sputtered and said they'd have someone else host. The family is divided on this one. I still feel like I am not being unreasonable. AITA?",

        "selftext": "Backstory: One of my (29/F) best friends (32/F) got married last spring. Since she got married we do mostly group hangouts with her husband (38/M) my partner and some other friends. Which is totally fine and fun! Now: I have a Galentine\u2019s party every year for my girlfriends. Usually about 4-5 of us and we and all bring an appetizer and have wine, play some games etc.  I texted the group to let them know and everyone responded. My friend messaged me privately to say that if her husband can\u2019t come, she can\u2019t come and asked if he could come with her. I normally would welcome him, but no one else\u2019s husband or boyfriends will be there and it just isn\u2019t that kind of party lol. I told her that no one else\u2019s partners would be there and she said that since being married they are a \u201cpackage\u201d deal and only attend things together.  I told her I respected whatever arrangements they had in their marriage and if she wasn\u2019t able to attend, I understood. However, a few days later a mutual friend told me that they talked and she said she was hurt by the fact I wouldn\u2019t invite him and felt I was being rude.  I do plan to talk to her about it, but just need some feedback from Reddit.  Edit: a few words  Edit #2: Because a lot of people asked - this party is held on the 13th, not on Valentines Day.  Edit #3 to add: thanks everyone who has taken the time to respond. I had a lot of anxiety about this. I knew I had done the \u201cright\u201d thing in my head. But then I second guessed myself. Now I feel good in the boundaries I set.  Edit #4: Galentines Day \u201cA day to celebrate female friendship, similar to Valentine's Day but for friends instead of romantic partners. It's often celebrated on February 13, the day before Valentine's Day. \u201c it\u2019s for all female friendships and not just singles. UPDATE: My friend ended up reaching out to me. She said that her husband is uncomfortable with \u201cgirls nights\u201d or events that he cannot attend. He told her \u201cI know what happens at girls nights\u201d. I guess he was cheated on in his previous marriage and he said he worries a lot. ",

        "selftext": "So basically, at a family barbecue last weekend, my uncle (mid-50s) kept making creepy comments about my girlfriend Kate(21F) who I invited. At first, it was backhanded compliments like, *Wow, you\u2019re way too pretty for him,* but then it got worse-*I would have snatched you up back in the day,* and *Must be a struggle to compromise for me?* He even joked about how my girlfriend must get hit on all the time and how I should *keep an eye on her.* On top of that, he was being *way* too touchy, putting his hand on her lower back, touching her arm when he laughed, and even leaning in way too close while talking to her. My girlfriend was clearly uncomfortable but tried to brush it off. She told me privately that it made her uncomfortable,  I confronted him in front of everyone, straight-up calling him a creep and telling him to knock it off in a loud way. He got defensive, saying he was just joking, and my mom told me I was out of line for embarrassing him like that.  Some family members agreed with me, but others think I overreacted and should've handled it privately since everyone knows him as a joker and just loves making conversation which he is good at. Some male cousins of mine are insinuating I was jealous and exaggerating stuff because my uncle talked to their partners too and they didn't have any complaints like Kate. My Uncle said he was just making jokes, and he didn't mean any of them, and he is really disappointed that I looked at him as that kind of guy AITA for calling him out publicly instead of pulling him aside?

Husband has never had a day alone with son so I asked him to try to figure it out but I\u2019ll be available if needed. He told his mother to come and help. I said no. He thinks I\u2019m ridiculous.  I (30F) and my husband (33M) welcomed our first child this past September. I have been fortunate to be on maternity leave but that ends next week. My husband had 2 months off and has been working full time since. He\u2019s off on Sundays and Mondays. I have never left my son except to go to a wedding in December but we were only away for 3 of his wake hours. My in laws watched over him and everything was fine.  I go back to work next week and my son will be attending day care. My husband is off this entire week and we\u2019ve just been taking a staycation. I told my husband though I want one day on my own to get more comfortable from being away from our baby and that I want him to have the day with the baby on his own. He has never been alone with him for more than an hour. He is a good father though and will help out when needed. But he has never been there for the full blown cries and fussiness while having to take care of the house.  A few days ago, we went to a friends house and our son was screaming bloody hell. Whenever I held him, he would calm down. Whenever my husband held him, he would just scream and cry even louder. So my husband just passed him along to me. I was getting frustrated cause I just wanted to relax with friends and he couldn\u2019t calm him down for a minute.  Today he tells me that his mom will be coming to help out. I asked him to tell her never mind cause he should be able to do it on his own. He called me ridiculous and it shouldn\u2019t matter but I think it really does. I can\u2019t be bothered at work unless absolutely necessary so I wanted t this to be our \u201ctrial\u201d. His mom will also be working on Mondays so it\u2019s not like she will be available to help out then. His mom is taking his side but of course she will cause our son is her only grandson.  So AITA for telling husband to figure it out and step up?  This is my first AITA post and I\u2019m frustrated just writing this so if you need more details to decide, just let me know and I\u2019ll respond.  ETA- I had a c section and I exclusively breastfed so I physically could not leave the baby in the first 2 months. My lactation consultant told me not to pump until after 2 months as I needed to establish my milk supply. He took care of my while I took care of baby. He doesn\u2019t do NOTHING. When I started pumping, husband was already at work. Husband does do feedings now.  ETA2 - this isn\u2019t a punch towards his mother. I adore her. It\u2019s really about him being independent with the baby. She helps us and I always appreciate it. Idk why yall think I\u2019m spiteful.  ETA3 - When my husband is home, I do separate myself from them by going to a different room. But he does often come to the room for help. I\u2019m not just dropping him off. ",

        "selftext": "I (28F) and my husband (27M) are expecting a baby soon. My parents live close by, while his mom is a few states away. I have a good relationship with his mom, but we aren\u2019t very close\u2014it\u2019s mostly polite conversations when she visits. I\u2019m happy for her to visit as soon as the baby is born. Since it\u2019s hard to predict the exact date, we plan to call her and my sister (who also lives out of state) when I go into labor. They know they\u2019re welcome to book a flight right away or wait until after the birth. Whatever works for them.  I recently told my husband I didn\u2019t want anyone staying overnight at our house for the first few days after birth. He seemed surprised but supported me, and we agreed to let everyone know. I told my mom first, explaining family is welcome to visit all day and into the evening, but I wanted the first few nights to bond as a family and adjust without overnight guests. This is our first (and likely only) baby, and I want to treasure those moments. I also explained that while I appreciate people wanting to help, having guests\u2014even well-meaning ones\u2014can be overwhelming. I have a lot of social anxiety/a low social battery and expect to feel exhausted and vulnerable after birth. \u00a0Not to mention both our mother\u2019s have no problem telling us what we are doing wrong and how we should be doing things. (My mom to me and his mom to him). I suspect it might be hard having people over all day when I am that tired and emotionally vulnerable right after giving birth, but I understand grandparents wanting to be around the baby right away and having some time to ourselves at night felt like a good compromise.\u00a0My mom understood and offered for my mother-in-law to stay at her house, which has a comfortable guest room. We also offered to pay for a nice water side hotel, giving her two options. When my husband explained this to his mom, she became upset and said if she couldn\u2019t stay with us, she wouldn\u2019t come at all. This response threw me off. We\u2019ve always hosted her before, even though having guests makes me anxious. I\u2019ve never said no because she\u2019s family and I feel I should get over my anxiety, but I feel the first few days after birth are different. My husband is supportive and says it\u2019s my decision, but I know he wants her to come. I want that too\u2014for her to meet her grandchild and for my husband\u2019s sake. But her reaction has left me feeling anxious and panicked about labor all of the sudden. I\u2019m torn. If I give in, I worry I\u2019ll feel overwhelmed and resentful, affecting the experience and weeks left leading up to it. If I don\u2019t, I\u2019m afraid it will hurt my relationship with her and disappoint my husband (even though it\u2019s her choice not to come). Does anyone have advice? Are the first few days after birth a good enough reason to stick to what makes me comfortable, even if it upsets her? I\u2019m trying to find a solution that works for everyone, but I\u2019m struggling.",

        "selftext": "I'm new to Reddit, so hopefully I do this right. I, 32 M, have been married to my wife Natalie, 30 F, for 4 years now. We have been living together with our 2 cats, Viktor and Warwick, since. The cats were mine before we got together, both of which I named after my favorite video game. Well, since Nat and I have been living together, she has been begging for a dog. Nat grew up with a Golden Retriever which she adored, and she had been pleading for us to get one. I was hesitant at first. I've never been much of a dog guy and I was unsure how the cats would react to having a dog around. Well, this Christmas, as a late Christmas gift, I caved, and surprised Nat with a Retriever puppy. I gave her permission to name the dog anything she wanted. Bitch. She chose Bitch. She said it'd be funny, and she'd always thought naming a female dog 'Bitch' was comical. I found it less funny. Not only would vets look down on us, but every Sunday, Nat and I babysit the neighbor's kids, 8 F and 6 M. What do we say when the kids ask about the fact the dog would have a collar with 'Bitch' on it? I thought it was stupid, and told her no. She told me I had just said she could name the dog, which is true, but I said I paid for the dog, and should at least approve the name. It's our dog after all. She said I was an asshole for taking away the freedom to name the puppy. AITA? **UPDATE:** Thank you all for the kind words and advice. My wife ended up finding out about this post through a Youtube short, which I find funny, since I never thought this post would blow up. I am at work now and we are trying to work it out over text, but my wife is still being pretty stubborn and she doesn't like how people are talking bad about her on Reddit now. Hoping we can reach a happy medium. **UPDATE:** I wanted to clear a few things up. First, my apologies about the spelling error. It is fixed. Second, when I say 'give permission' I should have worded it 'name the dog without my input.' Usually when naming a pet, it is in agreement of the two people. All I said to Nat was What are you gonna name her? And third, when I say 'begging for a dog,' I know she could get her own. I just don't like dogs and when she tried to convince me, I'd say no usually. Mutual agreement, again. I saw some people saying I was in the wrong because of the way I worded those parts of the story. So, I clarified a little. Anyways, we have since talked about the dog name and are still in a tiff. She is refusing to budge on her stance. I might just have to give in, as much as I don't like the idea",

        "selftext": "I recently had a baby with my boyfriend of 3 years, Nick. I work as a nurse with crazy hours and Nick previously worked in a warehouse. When I was pregnant, Nick expressed to me how he wanted to stay at home with the baby at least for the first couple of years as his dad was not in his life and he wants to soak up every moment of our child\u2019s life. We both agreed this would be best for our baby. I come from a conservative family and my parents were first not too pleased that we had a baby before marriage. My dad has made little hints here and there to Nick asking when is he \u201cgoing to make me an honest woman\u201d. When I told them Nick would stay at home with the baby, my dad took his glasses off, wiped his forehead and shook his head, but he did not say anything further. Recently at a family function, my cousin announced that she is pregnant! Everyone was giving her and her husband congratulations. My dad made a slide remark to them saying \u201ctalk to Nick here. He\u2019s an expert at the baby stuff\u201d. The comment was obviously meant to belittle Nick and my boyfriend just gave a nervous chuckle and nodded. Later in the day, our baby needed a diaper change, I was in the process of getting up to change him when my dad said to us \u201cwoah isn\u2019t that Nick\u2019s role? You do nothing while my daughter works. You can at least change a diaper while she is with her folks\u201d. I had had it. I told my dad to stop with his remarks. Nick is an EQUAL partner in our relationship and he is a wonderful dad who does most of the childcare. I told him just because he did fuck all of the child rearing for me and my siblings that does not mean all men need to be like him and he needs to get with the times because this isn\u2019t uncommon anymore. Things got awkward and mom quickly changed the subject to something else. My dad was pretty quiet for the rest of the night. After the event, my dad called me saying I disrespected him in front of our family and I was out of line. He said I insulted him as a father and to apologize. I told him I had nothing to apologize for and I was tired of him picking on Nick. My mom agrees with my father that I was too harsh on my dad.",

        "selftext": "I (28F) and my fianc\u00e9 (36M) are planning our wedding, and last night he accused me of being greedy and rude. Background: I come from a wealthy family and have worked hard to manage finances responsibly. My father has given each daughter $120K for their wedding. My sisters used all of it for their weddings, but I asked to use $70K for the wedding and $10K for a honeymoon, saving $40K to help with future children\u2019s expenses. My dad agreed to this plan, but only if I could make the wedding work with that budget. I didn\u2019t make this decision lightly. When I first got engaged five months ago, I considered using the full amount for a European wedding, but I realized I didn\u2019t want to prioritize that. A wedding is one day, and securing our future financial stability seemed more important. My fianc\u00e9 has been patient but has accused me of delaying the wedding due to indecisiveness, though I\u2019m just overwhelmed by spending so much on one day and managing everything else. Last night, I asked him to help review venues for a tour we\u2019re doing Monday. He rushed through options, and I started to cry from stress. I also wanted to vet the venues\u2019 prices before booking, but this frustrated him. He said I was rude for not wanting to use all the money for a wedding he would love, claiming that going over budget was fine because this was our most important day. He has always dreamed of a grand wedding with lots of guests. He criticized the venue I liked, an old library that only seats 180 and fits our budget. He said I was being rude by limiting my guest list to 60 people so he could invite 120 of his family. He also accused me of being \u201cgreedy\u201d for wanting to save the leftover money and said I looked like I was hoarding it. He argued that since we are financially well-off, I shouldn\u2019t worry about saving for future children. He also mentioned that our wedding planner had supposedly said I was being greedy, though he later admitted to making that up to show me how rude I was being. I thought I was being fiscally responsible by saving the extra money, but now I\u2019m questioning if I\u2019ve made the right decision. AITA?",

        "selftext": "My (M-late 30s) youngest sister (early 30s) is pregnant with her first child. The family is thrilled for her as she and her partner have been trying for a long time to get pregnant. When she announced it she mentioned that she was having a baby shower and my sister and I offered to help out where we can. For some reason, she took that as a \u201cmy brother said he would pay for the baby shower\u201d  and drafted a guest list of 120 people. I decided to text her one day and ask her what her budget was and I heard nothing for at least a day. My other sister and my mom mentioned that I had said to her that I would pay for the whole thing. That was never something I had offered to do. She never addressed it with me directly and said that she and her partner would pay for everything.  I took charge of creating the evite, registration site, driving an hour away to book the hall and put a deposit down, offered to do the centre pieces, pay for the stroller, driving back to the hall to add extra time to the reservation (because their archaic system doesn\u2019t allow people to book online), agree to pick up food on the day of, answer every inquiry from her guests who\u2019ve registered in the system. My husband offered to help out with the games for the shower. We saw my sister last week and she texted me on Monday saying, \u201cif he doesn\u2019t want to do the games, then tell me so I can give it to someone else.\u201d  I finally messaged back and said that I thought her message was a little harsh and if she was trying to imply something that she should just say it out loud. She then responded by saying \u201cfine. I\u2019m disappointed by how much work you\u2019ve put into this shower.\u201d That\u2019s when I lost it. I was objective and listed everything I had contributed so far. I also pointed out that I had never agreed to pay for a baby shower with 120 guests. I don\u2019t know much about them but I assumed they were intimate events in someone\u2019s home and not something the size of a wedding. I had less people at my own wedding. In addition to this, she complains about other people in her life to my mom and sister about how no one is pitching in. She asked my mom what she was contributing to the shower. My 70-year old retired mother was taken aback by that comment and offered to cook food for 120 people. She\u2019s been so ungrateful throughout this entire process and has since uninvited me to her shower and sarcastically said \u201cenjoy your 40th\u201d and removed me from my sibling group chat. ",

        "selftext": "Hey Reddit, thought I\u2019d get your opinion on this dispute I\u2019ve had with my neighbor over the last 3 months. My neighbor (87F) and I (28M) live in a rural area and access  our driveways through a wooded back road shared with 2 other houses. We live up north, and in the mornings it can stay dark until almost 8 am. My neighbor is older, nearly blind, and very stubborn. She has a \u201csupport dog\u201d (~4M) that helps her see, although he is not registered by any means. He is a friendly black lab and she has dressed him in a dog coat for warmth for as long as I can remember. The problem is, she lets the dog out in the morning to defecate and he has freedom to roam the shared road. Being a black dog and wearing a DARK BLACK COAT, he is almost impossible to see in the winter months. Between my neighbors and I, we have nearly hit this dog over 8 times in the past 2 months. I have talked to the neighbor about getting him a new coat or fixing bells to his collar or something, but she is attached to his coat for some reason and refuses to go with bells as they are too noisy and would be difficult for her to remove in her condition. Eventually, I took matters into my own hands after nearly smoking this poor pup when backing onto the shared road in my truck. I took the coat off of the dog and doused it in reflective spray paint. He sticks out like a sore thumb in the woods now, and my neighbors agreed it is much easier to see him. My neighbor had no idea for a few weeks until her step-nephew visited to help her with a plumbing issue and commented on the coat. She asked me about it, I owned up to it, and now she\u2019s furious - talking about vandalism and lawsuits. I admit I could\u2019ve got a separate reflective coat for him or used reflective tape or something, but I really think I helped more than I hurt the situation. AITA?",

        "selftext": "Last night my daughter was playing with legos before bedtime in the living room. This morning when our daughter woke up she walked onto the living room rug and suddenly began crying out hopping on one foot. It was still early morning and we all were a bit groggy. Our daughter hopped to her mom looking for comfort. Instead of consoling her, my wife kept insisting she wasn\u2019t hurt saying she just tripped on the rug. Our daughter kept saying she stepped on something but my wife kept disregarding it. I was quiet about the situation until this point where I stood up for our daughter and said I think she did step on something because she was playing with legos last night and the rug is thick. I looked at our daughter\u2019s foot and it was bleeding, so I cleaned it and put a bandaid on it. I then put on a funny video of people stepping on legos to cheer our kid up and show her it happens to other people too. After this my wife storms up stairs angrily. I wait a while to see if she comes back but she doesn\u2019t. I decide to put our daughter in the tub then go check on my wife. When I check on my wife, she is brooding and angry. I asked her what\u2019s wrong and she denied anything is wrong. I asked her why she stormed upstairs if nothing is the matter, she then proceeded to say we were ganging up on her. She said I provoked our daughter to go against her. I told her all I was doing was acknowledging our daughter was hurt when she was denying it. She then said I should have never come upstairs and make her angry. I told her she was acting childish and the situation was about helping our daughter, not about her. We began arguing, our daughter watching now. Noticing this, I shutdown the argument and took our daughter back to the bathroom to continue her bath and console her. I now feel like I\u2019m in the dog house for no good reason. I understand my wife may to feel like it\u2019s us against her and probably feels isolated, but I personally feel in this situation, she is being immature and self absorbed. AITA?

        "selftext": "I\u2019m going to jump right in because the funeral is this Friday. My ex husband passed away last week in a car accident, very unexpectedly. The troopers came to my house (I\u2019m his emergency contact) to break the news. The first person I called was his father, and he flew out the next day with my exs sister. Before he flew out he asked me where we should have the service, in texas (where we live) or back in Maryland where our families and friends all still live.  I told him I felt like the service needed to be in Maryland because that was where everyone was and P (my exes father) agreed. He let me know the funeral home said they might be able to do a small viewing with just family and I agreed to doing that as long as I felt like he was in a condition he\u2019d be ok with.  I met my exes sister and his dad at the funeral home to go over paperwork and plan the viewing, he told me all the details for the funeral back home and we talked a bit about where my ex worked, his day to day life, his home, and the probate process. His father was taking care of the probate process and seemed defensive about some of his belongings, I really felt like focusing on my children was more important than arguing over small things in the home\u2026 all of that could wait so I backed off of helping with cleaning out him home and handed all of his insurance paperwork and other information I had that would be useful to them like contacts at his work and his electric login.  We had the viewing, both of our children said goodbye to their dad and it was very emotional. At the viewing I mentioned that a friend had paid for our tickets to fly home as I was quickly realizing how much everything was going to cost and I suddenly was without the financial help of their dad.. I was extremely thankful for their generosity.  After the viewing I didn\u2019t hear anything from his sister or dad, they didn\u2019t ask to see the kids or let me know what was going on with the process and I was actively trying to navigate the life insurance process while grieving my ex and helping my children with their feelings. The last few days have been a blur of crying and anger for all of us, we are so heartbroken to have lost him.  My exes sister and father flew out on Friday and around noon I got a call from his father telling me we were not welcome at the funeral and that my children and I would be a distraction to his (my exes father) families grieving.  I\u2019m shocked and hurt, I told him I had never heard anything so hateful and the conversation was over.  My exes father and sister have never visited texas, we\u2019ve lived here for 4 years. They were not close and had no idea where he worked, or even any recent photos of him. We were divorced but still good friends, and my ex was a devoted father. His children were his world.  AITA for not listening to his father and still taking them? The funeral is open to anyone, I can\u2019t imagine us being there among hundreds of other people will really be a problem.  Edit: for those asking his reason, he said \u201cwell I gave you a nice service here\u201d -we had a short viewing only and had previously agreed to the service being in Maryland so no, there was no service.  Also for clarity I am the beneficiary on the policies, my ex and I did his open enrollment together every year and we put each other as our beneficiaries to make it easier if anything like this ever did happen  I have a wrongful death attorney and he is helping me with the process but I will reach out to a probate attorney.  Thank you to everyone for the advice on SSI ",

Don't see anything there. Get inside house and explain I went around the house twice shining the torch on the roof. There is no one there. But I am bombarded with 'who was it then'? No one. 'who could it have been?' no one was there . 'what were they doing on the roof' I don't even know if someone was there. 'how could they have gotten up there' I don't know. 'how do you not know, take a guess' I don't think anyone was there, probably a cat running around. 'You need to go speak with the neighbors to see if they saw something while I call the cops' I am not going to wake the neighbors at 3am and you are not calling the cops, just go to bed. 'No you need to go speak with the neighbors because you don't know anything. You don't know who it was, what they were doing there, how they got up there' 'Listen, I don't know who was there. I cannot know this. I don't know what they were doing there, I cannot know this, I dont know how they got up there, if you want to ask hypothetically then maybe they flew there, they parachuted off a plane and landed there, maybe it was spiderman. I just don't know because I cannot know. I have walked around the house and found nothing. You think me waking the neighbor will solve the mystery even though he knows less than us?   She is pissed off now saying it was a stressful situation and that I should have been cooperative and understanding of her feelings but instead I was a real asshole. No matter which way I look at it I can't think where I went wrong. I am not in the best moods at 3am",

        "selftext": "My (34/f) sister (43/f) is broke and has no groceries (according to her. I have not personally seen her kitchen). She is asking me for $40 to \u201cborrow\u201d (she never pays anyone back) so she can get some groceries. I told her I\u2019m really strapped for cash right now myself as I just had to pay rent, bills, and take my dog to the emergency vet which in itself cost $487. I don\u2019t get paid again until next week. As a note, she does not work due to several health issues. Her husband works but doesn\u2019t make that much, yet somehow makes \u201ctoo much\u201d to qualify for food stamps.  I told my sister what I could do is go to the dollar tree and get some stuff to help get them by until he gets paid. She got upset and offended and said \u201cum\u2026 no thanks, I\u2019m good\u201d. I told her I watch this lady on TikTok who makes really good looking stuff with dollar tree items. She still said no especially because their meat looks nasty and her main meal she eats daily is meatloaf which I really can\u2019t afford to get ground beef as it\u2019s so expensive around here right now.  I told her well beggars can\u2019t be choosers. That\u2019s her option, either that or go hungry. She said she\u2019d rather go hungry and hung up on me.  So, AITA for offering to get my sister groceries from the dollar tree? I feel like I might be the asshole because, yes, I could give her the $40, but then I wouldn\u2019t be 100% certain that would actually go towards groceries (she smokes weed) and I\u2019ve learned the hard way to never give her cash. But now I feel like an asshole and a bad sister.  ETA: I think I gave the wrong impression with the \u201cmakes too much\u201d for food stamps comment. The quotations was because I think it\u2019s ridiculous the state denies people food stamps when they\u2019re clearly struggling. I\u2019ve been in that situation too, where I was only able to pay for rent and utilities and get my food from the food bank and still I didn\u2019t qualify. The system sucks! UPDATE: thank you everyone for your input. My dad, whom my sister refuses to have anything to do with (long story for another post), very generously decided to cashapp her $40 for groceries. And she did show me proof that she spent it on groceries (yes, to make meatloaf and mashed taters lol). Anyways, just wanted to share that. We decided family is family and it was just the right thing to do. ",

        "selftext": "My (early-30's) wife (mid-20's) grew up in a fairly poor enviroment. Her grandpa had money, but her mom didn't and her sister doesn't. My wife has an incredibly strong work ethic (she's probably moreso defined as a workaholic). When I first met her, I was in trucking, making about 50k-70k/year. Since then I developed a niche for a speciality marketing field and became very good at it. All my friends encouraged me to go into business for myself with a marketing company. My wife was fully supportive of this, even after we discussed the financial difficulties we would have for the first year or so due to a l limited budget. I made sure she knew that some months, I may not get a check from the business (my salary is paid monthly).  Her family, however, were not. They accused me of neglecting my family, being lazy, not wanting to work, etc. They would constantly be bringing up the fact that I didn't have a job because I was always home (working remote). She would defend me, but they would ignore it and continue to call me lazy and a deadbeat for putting my daughter in daycare while I worked from home. I was still driving a truck part-time to have steady, reliable income but it was only half of what I was making on a good week.  In the last year however, I have grown my income from my business beyond what I was making in trucking, and have very little overhead. Since we cut costs back when I first started, we realized a lot of things we were paying for, we could do without or found other alternatives and we never really added those expenses back so it's like we have significantly more money now. I still drive a semi occasionally for a friend who owns his truck (mainly to keep my CDL active and stay knowledgable in the industry as a fallback). Her family has taken note, and they are constantly asking to go out to eat with us, hang out with us, etc then get mad when I never pay for the meals, the outing, the vacation, etc (aside from my part of the tab, obviously). Looking back, I understand why they never had money, they were living well beyond their means, but if it makes them happy then it is what it is.  I let my wife do whatever she wants with her money (which sometimes includes buying stuff for her family, which I support her doing with her money if that's how she wants to spend it) but I make sure that she knows I don't want a dime of my money going to her family since they were very unsupportive of what made us our money and would go as far as to talk down about me for doing what lead to our money.

        "selftext": "My baby shower is today and I was just told last night my aunt will be visiting for a few days from a different state and today is her birthday. Previous to last night I was unaware of her birthday or her even coming, then I was told my mother bought her A cake and plan on having everyone sing happy birthday at my shower. My issue is that there will be multiple strangers who have no clue who she is that will be forced to awkwardly sing to her, and they couldn\u2019t wait for another day. She is going to be here for a few days so Im confused why they couldn\u2019t simply take her to dinner after the event or a different day. When i expressed my concern my family implied I\u2019m being selfish and then proceeded to say I have no choice as I didn\u2019t pay for the shower. This is my first child and my family has made it clear this will be my one and only baby shower. So AITA for asking that this one event (not even the entire day just the event) to be about me only?  Edit: To everyone saying I should be happy to share this with my aunt because she came for me, I never said she came FOR me or for this shower. She just happens to be here and It would be a different situation if I were closer to this aunt but as previously mentioned im distant enough to have not even known it was her birthday. Also when this tia was originally told about my pregnancy she was insanely negative and criticizing telling me to possibly abort.  ",

        "selftext": "I (32F) live in NYC. I recently moved into a small building, three stories, 6 apartments in total. My apartment is a ground floor unit. From move in a neighbor (40F and 40M) has been storing their large stroller in front of my front door, which poses problems every time I have to come and go from my apartment. It is also against fire code and explicitly forbidden in the building's leases. The stroller is there every day, unless their kid (3M) decides he doesn't want to walk. One day when I heard them leaving it there, I introduced myself and politely said them leaving their stroller there was causing me issues and it is against the city's fire code and asked them to no longer keep their stroller in front of my front door. The 40F neighbor gave me excuses that they live on the third floor, but the 40M neighbor straight up raised his voice at me, while I was holding my infant daughter. The woman said as a compromise she'd fold the stroller when leaving it front of my door. As time went on, the stroller was never folded up and continued to block my door. As it is against fire code, and explicitly forbidden in the lease, I decided to reach out to property management for help resolving this issue. I just want to be able to safely come and go from my apartment.  The day the property management enforced this on these neighbors, the 40F neighbor rang my doorbell, and proceeded to refuse to speak to me and called her mother. Her mother then berated me on speaker phone and said I should have spoken to them first, ignoring me when I said I did. She then kind of threatened me saying I complained about the wrong people. I was stunned and couldn't believe this was happening. All I could muster was insisting it is against fire code and no one gets to break fire code.  I am baffled by this behavior. I found it a bizarre confrontation and I didn't know adults could act this way. I've never had issues with neighbors before.  I have a child younger than their's and empathize with their situation, but their kid is massive and able to walk. They could just have an umbrella stroller, like I do. I just wanted access to my front door. AITA? tl;dr neighbor in small apartment building breaks fire code and blocks my front door and ignores polite personal request to stop. I take it up with building management. The neighbor initiated bizarre confrontation with her mother on speaker phone, making vague threats. AITA?  EDIT: I appreciate the outside perspective. I didn't think I was TA, but I do have hardcore people pleasing tendencies and it was very clear my actions hurt people's feelings, and it gave me self doubt.  The reason I engaged with the mother on the phone at all is bizarre too, it's all just too weird and I'm reeling a little lol. The 40F neighbor has an unusual way of speaking, I haven't been able to work out if it is an accent or what. When she put the mother on speaker phone I had a sinking thought that maybe the 40F neighbor is deaf and needs someone to talk for her and I felt bad that maybe I'd made a deaf person feel victimized when they can't speak up for themselves???? But like she clearly wasn't deaf, her mother was just on speaker phone with no video and she had zero issues following the conversation. Apart from this is incident and the other shitty neighbor stuff this woman and her man have pulled, they seem like normal functional adults. The man does not have an unusual way of speaking. I don't think her unusual way of speaking is really a factor in whether I'm TA, and I have been so eager to be polite and respectful. It became clear very quickly the phone call wasn't really about helping in communication, but just messy people expressing their anger as much as possible. But yeah, that's why I let the phone call happen. Messy. ",

        "selftext": "I (24F) and my sister (30F) inherited a very nice apartment from our parents in SoHo. Their will sort of just said it\u2019s up to us how we split it up. We sort of decided that because it\u2019s in the family trust just to both use it how we saw fit. Two years ago, my sister got a job in Manhattan and moved there with her family (two kids and husband). Now, I am going to grad school in the city and want to live there as well (it\u2019s basically free and which is super helpful with student loans).  My sister moved into the master bedroom and she gave her two kids her old bedroom and the guest room. The master bedroom and the guest room both have their own bathrooms. My old bedroom from when we stayed there with our parents is pretty small but I loved it at the time because it was never our primary residence.  Now, I want to live in the guest room with the restroom as I am now an adult and have my niece move to my old room. My sister is saying it\u2019s unfair to move my 8 year old niece out but I don\u2019t think so because it\u2019s my apartment just as much as it\u2019s her and she already moved to the master ( which even though it\u2019s much nicer I have no issues with).  On a side note, I also requested my father\u2019s old office, which her husband uses while she uses my mom\u2019s. My mom\u2019s has two desks and is objectively the most beautiful room in the whole apartment. As a student probably going to have to work a couple separate jobs to pay for my education, it would be really nice to have a desk to do HW on. My brother in law is also a stay at home dad and mainly uses the office for gaming.  AITA for wanting to use our apartment like this? Edit: thank you all for the help. just to answer some of your questions there was no real agreement on how to split it up because my parents died pretty suddenly and the will hadn\u2019t been edited in a while. as for property taxes and stuff my parents trust covers it ( my sister mainly handles that stuff). some people asked about the loans and stuff but basically when i turn 25 in 11 months i get access to some of the cash assets and should be able to pay off everything so it\u2019s not that big a deal. I also wouldn\u2019t want to sell the apartment if possible because my mother spent so much time on it and i miss her a lot and you can see her touch in all the furniture and stuff. ",

        "selftext": "I feel so awful about this, but my husband has a habit of forgetting/ignoring things I say. I WFH and am always there to unlock the front door for my husband when he gets back from work, so the couple of times I\u2019ve needed the car, I get very annoyed that he\u2019s taken the house keys attached to the car keys with him. This has happened a few times, he\u2019ll lock all the house doors in the morning and go off to work with the car keys so I can neither leave the house nor drive anywhere.  So I made sure we have two sets of keys and the second pair must always be on the console table for emergencies. The problem is my husband started keeping the emergency keys in his work bag and if he took the car anywhere, I was again locked in the house. This recently happened again when my family was coming over and they stood at a locked door while I searched the house for his work bag.  Today I woke up very unwell and wanted to run to the chemist between meetings and pick up a book I had on hold at the library, when once again, my husband has taken the car keys. What made me so angry was that I\u2019ve told him this a million times and I could have had a massive emergency. He was so calm and apologetic on the phone and but that just made me angrier. I\u2019m sick of him never listening.   So I lost it and demanded he come home immediately and drop the keys back because I need to go to the chemist. He started apologising and saying he has a meeting at work about to start, but I told him this is not a discussion and I expect him back home right now because I\u2019m sick of repeating myself. He said he\u2019s on his way back but I feel so awful for stressing him out while he\u2019s at work and making him take a 40 minute journey back. But I\u2019m also so desperate to be heard the first damn time, exactly how I listen and respect his wishes. Am I an asshole? ",

        "selftext": " My (F 44) Dad (68) has always been frugal. His frugality has served him well, he has a beautiful home, savings, he's been retired for over 10 years, multiple rental properties etc.. Recently my daughter (15) and I drove up from Phoenix to visit him over the weekend. Typically my Dad cooks breakfast every morning, on this particular morning, he didn't feel like it and told us we were going out to breakfast. This is a little unusual since he **does not like to eat out due to the expense**. He took us to a local diner type place and we all ordered. My daughter ordered the chicken fried steak. I heard my Dad mumble something like ..the things you order. I thought he was just referring maybe to the portion size since my daughter is so small, but, it didn't seem like a big deal at the moment. We all ate, my daughter ate all of her food, we both said thank you before and after our meal and were very appreciative. Later on that day while I was cleaning out his refrigerator, my Dad says I can't stand it anymore! gets out of his recliner and comes into the kitchen with us. He then goes into how our lack of manners needs addressing. He has this rule of etiquette that says that if someone invites you to a meal out, you should never order anything more expensive than the person that's paying. I think it's rude to put that responsibility on a guest. Of course moderation in all things, for instance , I think it's rude if I took someone out to dinner and they order a bunch of drinks for themselves or an outrageously priced meal but, this was chicken fried steak at a diner, not a magnum of champagne.     I was surprised when he brought it up. My daughter had told me that he'd mentioned it to her   whie visiting him at his winter place a few years ago, and I told her to let me know if it happened again and I'd talk to him about it. I got extremely uncomfortable with the conversation because I don't want to be disrespectful to anyone in their own home. I was try to be as careful as I could be while still defending my daughter. I reminded him that if he had a reprimand for her to let me know, and I'll handle it. However, we will respect his rule when we are with him and apologized for any disrespect he felt as that was definitely not our intention. However, no, that's not etiquette that we (my ex-husband and I) are going to impart on her. He seemed pretty miffed about it, saying that it's a normal rule of etiquette and that we would feel the same way if it happened to us (we would absolutely NOT feel put out if a guest ordered chicken fried steak, lol).      And for context, my daughter is a fantastic person. She's kind and respectful, she still goes and visits her grandparents. She's patient with his stories and helps him, they cook together, all kinds of nice things. She's a delight and does not need to be taught a lesson.       I'm going back to my Dad's house this weekend, if it comes up again am I the asshole here?",

        "selftext": "I'm pissed over this so please tell me if this makes no sense. I, (22F) have been with my incredible girlfriend, Layne (22F) for just over a year now. I introduced her to all my friends about four months in and since then she's been hanging out with us (seven including me) regularly. So, I have a friend, Freya (23F), who is kind of nosy. For a couple weeks, Layne has been out of town (before anyone asks, she didn't want me to come. I offered but she said she just needed to do this alone) for family issues I won't spill here, and Freya has been nagging me like crazy about it. Me and my friends all go to the same university, and we hangout pretty much everyday, so I can't avoid her.  First, I thought it started with honest concern. I told her what I said before, that she's out of town for some family stuff. Plain and simple. Subtly trying to get the idea across that it's none of her fucking business. She accepted that for all of one day. She then amped it up to pressing about exactly *what* the family thing is. I just kept shutting her down, calmly asking her to drop it, saying that Layne doesn't want her stuff being aired out like that (which she had explicitly told me). But she just wouldn't take no for an answer. Just kept insisting that it was fine if she knew, and I would just ignore her. Last night was my last straw. We were hanging out at a local bar when Layne called me. I told my friends I'd be back in a bit and went outside to take it. Layne was pretty upset, so I told her I'd get a cab and go home so I could fully focus on her. I quickly went back into the bar to tell my friends I had to go, mind you, I still had Layne on the line because I was only anticipating for it to take a minute. I just said something like Hey guys, but I gotta go, see you later, and pointed at the ongoing call. Freya, who was dead sober, decided it was a great idea to try to grab my phone from my hand, yelling questions at Layne. I backed up and held the phone to my chest, completely surprised because seriously what the fuck? I yelled at her to back off and told her my girlfriend's personal stuff was none of her business. She spluttered for a second, everyone else just staring at us bewildered before I just left. I talked to Layne on the way home and told her what happened, but said it was no big deal rn and refocused the conversation on what she needed to talk about. By the time I got home I had turned my phone on do not disturb and was facetiming Layne, so I didn't see the messages from my friends until today. Freya was pissed that I yelled at her, and two of our other friends, Toby (23M), and Clay (22M) shared the same sentiment of me embarrassing Freya by getting so angry at her when she was just worried about Layne. The rest of my friends were asking me if I was okay and siding with me. I just wanna know, despite my friends and Layne telling me Freya was totally weird for it, did I overreact? I'm starting to feel a bit guilty, I never *ever* yell like that.",

They didn't seem that upset about the promise, and probably thought I wasn't serious.  But our youngest, Jennifer (now 21) never smoked. She was honest about this and her sisters also said Jennifer never smoked. After she turned 21 she came to me to talk about the promise. While I was hesitant, I wasn't going to break a promise I made to her. So I bought her a car.  This did not go over wel with Hailey and Cynthia, who argued it was really unfair.

        "selftext": "My (37F) wife and I (36M) have always tried to keep the housework pretty evenly split between us. I, for example, mow the lawn, and do laundry and dishes, and she meal plans, cooks, and picks up/drops off the kids. Lately, this has all changed because she has become addicted to a game called Dress to Impress on Roblox. If you aren't familiar, it's a game where you have to dress your character in a themed outfit before the time runs out, and the other players rate it from 1 to 5 stars.     It started off harmless, just a fun thing she would do during downtime before bed, but recently she has missed crucial appointments and chores because of this game. I tried to be understanding and gently remind her to do her tasks but she would always say she forgot or got distracted.     The big argument happened last night when she forgot to pick up our 9 year old son from basketball practice, which ended at 6:00. I hadn't gotten home yet as I had to work late, and our son doesn't have a phone, so I had no way of knowing the situation. I eventually got home around 7:00 and realized he was not in his room. I looked around further and saw that he was nowhere to be found. I walked into our bedroom, confused, to ask my wife where he was and found her on her iPad playing the game as always. When I asked her where our son was her eyes grew wide and I knew what happened without her having to say. I immediately got back into my car and went to pick him up, luckily, his coach had stayed after to make sure he was picked up safe and I apologized profusely. Apparently, he had been calling and texting my wife, who was the emergency contact, and she didn't even notice.     When we got home I immediately blew up at her. How could she be so addicted to a kids game that she completely forgot our son? Now, she's telling me it was a one time thing and that I'm an asshole for getting angry. I don't know what to think, I do kind of understand her side of the story as it has only happened one time, but she has to be a responsible parent. She can't just completely forget about our child who has no way to get home on his own! So, AITA?",

I\u2019ve called a friend who has agreed to come over tonight and he will crash in my spare room until I feel safe. I\u2019m going to contact the police tomorrow and make a report as well as get a runner and a cheap camera as soon as I get paid. I\u2019ll update if anything changes, but I hope you all have a fantastic night and thank you for the advice.   I (30f) have 4 dogs, but the one this story is about is a 4f rottie named Bella. A few months ago new renters moved next door, and things have been unpleasant to say the least. The neighbors are always screaming and fighting late into the night and the men in the home have a habit of always trying to talk to, or just watch, me when I'm outside. This is not done in a friendly way, and it has made me feel very uncomfortable. I\u2019m a single female living alone, and our police force isn\u2019t the best so I just keep my head down hoping they\u2019ll move out soon. The other night, around 11pm, I was outside with my dogs in the backyard.  My neighbors have a chain fence, but I have no fence along my property except for the part that separates their property from mine. One of my dogs is on leash, but the other three are completely trained off leash and do not leave the yard. I know some people may not agree with that, but I live in the countryside, and also my dogs have NEVER run off.  One of the women who lives next door, for some reason, decided to enter my yard because she wanted to \u201cjust play with my puppies\u201d. Bella growled and walked closer to me and I asked the woman to please leave but she just kept telling me it was fine and ignored what I was saying. One of the men decided to join her and they came more onto my property, which then led to Bella barking and after a few moments of them continuing she chased after them. She stopped running the second she hit the property line and went inside with me immediately after.  Now these neighbors keep making comments about not feeling safe with their kids, and how I should have called my dog back because they weren\u2019t a threat. I don\u2019t feel like I did anything wrong but I also don\u2019t want the area to think that my dogs are dangerous, especially with the stigma against rotties. I also don\u2019t want to stir up unnecessary drama when it\u2019s already difficult living next to these people. AITA?",

My wife has been struggling with constant nausea and pain, which has led her to be basically bed ridden the past few months. Her nausea has been a bit better lately, so my mom and sister decided to throw us a baby shower (I know that dad isn\u2019t typically invited, but that\u2019s just how my family does it.) Well, my MIL is not happy about any of it. She is upset that my family is throwing the shower (even though she never offered to help) and upset that men were invited. That, I could see from her point of view and put aside for the sake of reducing drama. What I couldn\u2019t forgive was her comments toward my wife the second she came through the door. She claimed that my wife \u201cwasn\u2019t really that sick\u201d and was \u201cjust doing it to get out of work\u201d when, in reality, my wife was working online literally from the bathroom in between vomiting. The kicker was when my sweet sister tried to lighten the mood saying \u201cwell, at least (wife) is feeling better now\u201d and MIL said \u201cI bet she\u2019s just her to get our money and attention, then not show her face for another month.\u201d I was LIVID. I told her she needed to shut up or leave, because this day was about supporting my wife and our baby, so she needed to do that. That ticked her off so she screamed at my wife and I for being ungrateful until my wife cried, so I told her to \u201cjust f**k off already.\u201d She finally listened and left, any the rest of the party went somewhat smoothly. However, some family members said I should have just ignored her, and wife doesn\u2019t want to talk about it. So, was I in the wrong?",

        "selftext": "So my (24f) mom is living with me since she got divorced a decade ago and has been struggling to manage things on her own since then. She lost her job in the summer and originally was looking a bunch for jobs but now isn\u2019t really doing that. But she met someone working for my apartment recently and they were talking a little bit for a few months. Now this talking was literally just seeing each other outside and chatting for a minute before going about their way.  Well she had him over for the first time on Christmas Eve 2024. We were find with that but requested he please not stay overnight since he\u2019s a stranger to us. She refused to kick him out and he stayed in our apartment the whole night. After that I tried to discuss with her some boundaries which I thought were reasonable. The only boundary I had was for him not to stay overnight until me and my sister got to know him better. She was mad at us for that and frequently argued with us and tried to plead with us but respected it.  But one night it was weird because she went to bed at 10pm then at 11 comes to get us saying he texted her wanting to come over and would we let him. We gently stated our boundary again and she said that she\u2019d already told him he could stay overnight. That hurt me a little but she ended up telling him to go back home. She was pissed though since he lives a few hours away and only comes to the apartment to work. But he could come over a couple nights a week and they\u2019d sleep together then he\u2019d leave before it got too late.  And some of why me and my sister requested this boundary is because our dad was notorious for having random people over when we\u2019d come for visitation as teenagers and not warning us beforehand.  And it\u2019s also weird because not once have they gone on a traditional date. They never go place together and my mom has no interest in it. It\u2019s only sex in her room a couple nights a week. And she\u2019s also been drinking a lot more since meeting him which concerns me because she\u2019s already jobless.  Final part of the story is that she says he just broke up with her because me and my sister wouldn\u2019t let him stay overnight. I tried to tell my mom we didn\u2019t mean never and just wanted to get to know him before a stranger sleeps in our apartment. I also think it\u2019s weird that he would rather not be with her than wait a little bit to sleep with her overnight. And keep in mind that they were seeing each other multiple times per week, just not overnight. My mom is pissed at me and begging me to let him stay overnight so she can get him back and giving me the whole spiel about how she has always taken care of us and this is how we repay her. Saying don\u2019t you care about my mental health and that he\u2019s the only thing that makes her happy.  This has been weighing on me for weeks so I really need to know\u2014 AITA for upholding my boundary?  ETA: adding a new section for where the guy lives to make it more clear since I shouldn\u2019t have buried it in long paragraphs. I don\u2019t want to reveal too much but he lives 3 hours away and his job involved traveling so he\u2019s down where we are on weekdays and doesn\u2019t have a permanent place up here.  ETA again: sorry guys I typed this all up in an emotional rush and probably didn\u2019t explain myself the best. Yeah of course we lived with my mom when I was 14 until college when I started paying most of the rent cause my mom was struggling. But me and my sister moved for a work opportunity a few years ago and our mom came with us since she didn\u2019t have much at our old place and couldn\u2019t pay rent alone so that\u2019s why we live together now. When the divorce happened we lost the house and have been living in apartments and people\u2019s basements since.  ",

We found a place to stay and all in all it was around $600 per person for the rental and we decided it was just easiest to have one person (me) put all the money upfront and just everyone pay me back before the actual trip, which everyone did. In my friend group we have a girl let\u2019s call Sarah. Sarah comes from a comfortable family and was even one of the people who suggested the trip and was one of the leading forces to finding the Air Bnb. Literally in the weeks leading up to the trip we were all fine, sending outfit ideas, restaurants to books etc. the Tuesday before we left (Saturday) Sarah starts sending texts to the gc like \u201cguys Jacob\u2019s (boyfriend) family is going to xxxxx next week\u201d basically sending us a LOT of details about where his family is going for winter vacation that we didn\u2019t really need to know. Then on Thursday (again we leave on Saturday) she texts the gc saying how she couldn\u2019t go because she had a family emergency, said her grandma had gotten admitted to the hospital . We were obviously bummed but family comes first and I told her that I would send her the money back that she sent towards the rental. We go on the trip and everything is ok until one of my friends who has Sarah\u2019s location on Life360 (roommates) sees that she\u2019s in a beach town and we put 2 and 2 together. We spend that night pissed and we call her out the next day where she admits everything. She had been last minute invited on her boyfriend\u2019s vacation and decided that she wanted to go to that instead but didn\u2019t know how to tell us. We were all obviously hurt and upset that she would choose a boy over us but at the end of the day she\u2019s a 19 year old girl so I guess it\u2019s just immaturity. The part that I\u2019m wondering if I\u2019m the asshole with is that after finding out that she voluntarily pulled out of the trip, I had told her I wouldn\u2019t be refunding her the $600 she had sent me for the rental. She pulled out so last minute that we couldn\u2019t find anything cheaper and I said I was ok just wasting that money because again I thought she was having a family emergency. After finding out that she wouldn\u2019t be getting that back she went insane and started calling me a bad friend and everything. My parents think I should send it back to her but I don\u2019t see why I should, she pulled out because of her boyfriend and expected us to all just absorb the costs?? ",

        "selftext": "tw loss of a parent I (42F) have been married to my husband (48F) for 12 years, together for 15. We both work full time, no kids. My husband is ND and extremely successful in his career, but struggles with day-to-day functioning. He has a lot of dietary restrictions and over the years I was happy to work around those--mostly we now eat homemade salad and baked chicken, in various forms. Unfortunately, this resulted in a situation where I do ALL the cooking. Any attempts to cook for me have lasted about one night before he is overwhelmed and frazzled and so I just go back to cooking as it's what I have always done. I also pay all the bills, manage the household, take care of the dogs, do the laundry, clean the house, and work my own jobs. I am an academic and work at two schools. Over the last five years, my husband has been sick with various ailments, starting with atypical long covid, and then this year accelerating into an allergy to wood dust, intolerance to edibles, allergy to a paint I used on the kitchen cabinets, a reaction to our gas stove, and now (and this is the problem) an inability to tolerate chicken being baked in a tiny electric toaster oven as I'm not allowed to use gas anymore. He will not eat other meats or pasta. I cannot use the stovetop as causes oil to splatter and it bothers him. He has pursued no medical solution aside from an inhaler from his PCP. His symptoms are mysterious and variable. He has not seen an allergist or rheumatologist in spite of my pleading. In the middle of all of this, I was the primary caretake for my father, who died slowly and brutally. He died in my arms on 12/21/24 after 10 months of illness, during which time I became his medical and financial power of attorney. He died hardly more than two weeks ago. For those of you that know, you know. For those of you that do not know, I don't want you to know. I am now the primary caretaker for my mother. Since the death, my husband's health issues about me cooking have arisen and have become the focal point of a tremendous amount of friction in our marriage and home life. I know I am not helping; I am exhausted, I am traumatized by the death, I am lost, I am angry at not being able to cook in my own home unless I break my work day to do so, so that the chicken offgassing has passed by the time he returns home from work. And even then it causes so much stress, which compounds my desperate sadness. It seems silly to grieve the loss of the ability to cook as I did, but I do. This morning, finally, I realized that perhaps I needed to remove myself from this whole emotional food-centered loop and told my husband he can cook and shop for himself and I will cook and shop for myself and the dogs. He was not happy about this at all. I feel like a miserable failure of a wife. But I am drowning. I had to put some sort of boundary down so that I could protect and nourish myself in this hard time. AITA for longer wanting to cook in this impossible environment? ETA: thank you, thank you all so much. You have  made such a difference. I am reading and processing all you\u2019re saying and will reply to everything.",

So I went through every single one for the past year, and there were over 100 charges from PlayStation. I only had 4 purchases on my 2 PS accounts in a single year, so I panicked as someone had my cc info. In all, the total charges were around 1500. I contacted both of my siblings who's kids also have accounts and asked nicely if their kids may have purchased anything using my bank account before i make a dispute. Both said no, so I went ahead and called both PS and my bank. The bank was able to chargeback past few months and rest is under investigation. Well a few days later I get a frantic call from my teenage nephew who says his PS account was perma banned. I asked him if he was sure he didn't buy anything with a cc after I gave him a several hundred dollars PS giftcard for his birthday this summer to spend on stuff, he again denied. So I have his email logins and sure enough, it was purchases he made to his account. All the stuff he plays. Then he starts to say maybe he bought a few items here and there.  Now my sister is pissed at me. She says I must have added my cc info to buy him something at some point in time, and it was all my fault he was making purchases from my card. If it were her cc, she'd get an alert. Never that he may have taken my cc info, no. She doesn't want him to lose his account, and said she'll call PS to pay for it all. She said he always asks and she gets alerts and doesn't understand that I didn't, so I shouldn't blame him. I said well he knew he was spending someone else's money, so why is it my fault? And that he stopped asking her for permission to make purchases because no one stopped him. After that she said I was blaming her kid for everything. So AITA here? ##Edit:  Info:He is almost 15.I'm unsure of how he got my payment info. ##Update! After an intense argument, she was still denying he made the charges at all. I was finally able to show her each and every transaction (before I had only explained and she didn't believe me). After seeing the evidence, he finally fessed up. He claimed he thought it was HER card \ud83e\udd2a. She will be paying me for all the money he used on my account and will not be getting the PS5 back, until he works to pay it off. Even then she may not let him have it. He insists that he will be paying us both double for our troubles. But the real damage done here is the trust I have in both of them.",

        "selftext": "So this happened yesterday, my mother just let herself into my house (I am a 36 yr old woman) and walked into my bedroom at around 910am without a heads up she was coming over, nor asking if she could come over, or even knocking at the damn patio door that was open for my dog and yelling in that she was there.  She just walked into my bedroom and proceeded to ask why I wasn't wfh yet and  after being told to leave, she pottered around in my kitchen cleaning stuff and attempted to fill the second dog water bowl (first and the one in my bathroom were full). She has essentially ocd and it drove me nuts when I was a child, but coming into my house to nitpick everything is just unacceptable. I told her to leave multiple times, and after a good 5min plus of that I told her to get the f out asap, she did not take kindly to it but she never takes kindly to me establishing boundaries. Her just walking in unannounced has happened around once every other month past couple years and my anxiety is off a cliff because of this and other personal stuff. I know she wants to help but I am going insane over the intrusiveness. I am having mental health problems (severe depression and anxiety and chronic insomnia) which I have been working on all through 2024 and now am going to have a first app with a psychologist next week.  I just want to know if I am over-reacting or under-reacting because this has been my whole life. Overstepping, boundary pushing parents.  Don't even get me started on what happened in Mexico when I was 21 and she overstepped lol severely during our group holiday. She tried to start cleaning my sink cause it was not up to her standards, I just cannot anymore.",

        "selftext": "I (25f) and my boyfriend (28m) have been together for 3 years and have been living together with my twins (3m) for 2 years. Me and their father (26m) have never been together and he hadn\u2019t wanted to be a part of their life until they were a year old. We have a custody agreement that they go every other weekend with him on Saturday with me dropping them off and picking them up but last weekend my boyfriend had to pick them up because I had a work trip. For context, the twins don\u2019t know life without my boyfriend we have been together since I found out I was pregnant and he was there for all the ultrasounds and birth classes he sat and read all the books with me and was there for the labor. He loves them like his own and in my eyes they\u2019re as much his kids as mine he was up all the late nights taking care of not only me but them too. Back to it, he was picking up the kids for me (this is not the first time), and they had called him daddy to get his attention while he was talking to my ex. He said that my ex had \ufffcseemed to be okay with it and he left to take them home but while I was at the airport my ex called me screaming saying how undermining and disrespectful it was that the twins called him daddy while and they wouldn\u2019t speak at his house which I had not known about considering that the twins don\u2019t stop talking at my house until they fall asleep but then he started complaining about custody which was originally his idea because he was working a lot and saying that it was my fault because my boyfriend is spending more time with them and that he doesn\u2019t have enough time to bond with them. He then started on how it was \u201cnot right\u201d that the twins were so comfortable with my boyfriend but his fianc\u00e9 couldn\u2019t hug the twins without bribing them with something, I ended up hanging up on him because my plane was boarding and he was just screaming at me. Later when I got home his fianc\u00e9 started calling and texting me which I ignored because she\u2019s been known to have a terrible attitude toward me even when I\u2019m just picking up the twins, I talked with my boyfriend to see what we should do about the twins calling him daddy and he said that it\u2019s up to me and he loves it but would understand if I told them to stop but I don\u2019t know I love that my twins call him dad I feel like he\u2019s earned it but I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m being a dick because my ex is in their life and he is their father. (Update)I would like to thank you all for the support and advice that you have sent us, I sat down with my boyfriend and we read through the comments when the twins were napping and were especially grateful for the comments from people who were and are in a similar situation because it give some insight on how to handle this all. There are a few things I would like to share now that we are planning on doing/ talking about. First one of the biggest things I saw in the comments was the custody, we don\u2019t have a written legal agreement on the matter but my boyfriend is going to be connecting one of his friends who is married to a family lawyer to see if she can help and draw up an agreement. Secondly, I saw a lot of comments on the mental manipulation that may be happening to the twins I have been in therapy since I was twelve because of depression and anxiety with a family history of mental illness like bipolar so therapy has always been a thing that I wanted my kids to be in when I felt would be most beneficial and I definitely didn\u2019t want them to start this young but \ufffcthe comments on what meant be happening at my ex\u2019s house I think me and my boyfriend will start looking at therapist together for the twins. I haven\u2019t talked to my ex yet but I had to block him earlier today because he was repeatedly repeatedly calling and texting me while at work.\ufffc I\u2019ve taken him off of the pickup list at their daycare and I\u2019m going to be texting him tomorrow because I don\u2019t feel like them going over there is the best thing for the twins right now so we\u2019re planning on going out of the city to stay with my bf\u2019s parents at their house. That\u2019s all I have for today but I will try to keep you guys updated on what\u2019s happening, thank you again for all the love and support.",

        "selftext": "I (26 F) divorced my ex husband (26 M) about four years ago. We share 2 children, a son and a daughter. During our divorce hearing we were able to work out custody, visitation and child support arrangements. He agreed to give me full custody of the kids and he would pay child support. After the divorce he decided to up and move to Nashville to chase his \u201cmusic career\u201d that never existed. He managed to work his way up to almost $6,000 behind on his child support, went 7 months without a phone call or visit and when he moved back I let him start seeing the kids as soon as he asked (2 weeks after he arrived in our state). I try to always remind myself that my relationship with him is not the kids relationship with him. Anyway fast forward to now, his grandfather has been paying his child support monthly (according to his grandmother and aunt) so that he doesn\u2019t lose his license or go to jail. He went out and got a job about 2 months ago and the lady assigned to our case is great at her job so even though he did not report his job, she knew he was working. His grandfather pays the monthly amount on the last day of every month, so I received December\u2019s amount on December 31st. On January 3rd I received another payment to that account and approximately 30 minutes after the notification my children\u2019s father starts calling me asking for the money back because it was a mistake payment. I simply explained that I couldn\u2019t give the money back but if he reached out to child support I would be okay with them giving it back. The conversation continues until he admits that they have started garnishing his wages. He proceeds to tell me that they took his entire paycheck, he can\u2019t buy lunch, or put gas in his car. He wants me to \u201cgive $200 back\u201d and he will \u201callow me to keep the extra $82\u201d. I simply stated that I didn\u2019t think it was fair to give the money back when they had credited his account for paying that amount. I also informed him that I do not use that card for personal reasons and all of the money is used on the kids wants and needs. Both of my kids birthdays are in January, i had already told the kids that we will go to a waterpark for a weekend so if I keep the money that\u2019s what it will be used on. He started calling me names and telling me that I\u2019m impossible and never happy. So am I the asshole for not giving my ex husband lunch money because he claims they took his whole check? ",

        "selftext": "I (36F) am a new manager at my office. I started about 4 months ago, and while I\u2019ve been trying to get to know my team, I still don\u2019t have all the dynamics figured out. One of my team members recently asked me to buy Girl Scout cookies from his daughter and I said I couldn\u2019t because I have celiac disease which makes me allergic to the cookies. He suggested I purchase a box and give it to a friend or family member because it would mean a lot to him and his kid. The conversation continued back and forth but we didn't argue so I thought everything was fine between us. Then I find out that he\u2019s been talking behind my back about how bad of a manager I am because I\u2019m \u201cstubborn and stingy\u201d. Apparently their previous manager used to buy a lot of cookies so I look mean in comparison. I\u2019m not close enough with my other coworkers (besides the one who told me about the gossip) to talk to them about this, but I get the impression they\u2019re on his side because one of them made a big show of leaving a plate of cookies they\u2019d bought from him in the breakroom telling everyone to help themselves and then saying directly to me, \u201cthis flavor is gluten free so feel to eat some!\u201d. I wanted to keep the peace so I just said thanks, but I didn\u2019t eat any because I\u2019m pretty strict about cross contamination with gluten. I worry that I made things worse by not eating them, but at the same time I don\u2019t think I\u2019m obliged to support his cause. My friends say I should just buy a box this time and if he does it again then I can stand my ground but it\u2019s not really about the cookies now. It\u2019s about him trying to shame me into doing what he wants. AITA for not buying cookies from him?   Edit 1: Thank you everyone for weighing in! I'm surprised by how many people have been affected by people selling things in their office. I definitely won't be buying his cookies and I'm going to sit down with him to discuss the bad-mouthing. I think I'll wait to escalate this to HR because I'm getting the sense that he wouldn't respond well. It's definitely tough as a new manager and woman so I'm determined to do this right! ",

        "selftext": "Hey Reddit, I\u2019m a 15 year old guy, and this week has been one of the hardest of my life. My dog, Romeo, passed away unexpectedly a few days ago. He wasn\u2019t just a dog, a lot of people get wgat i mean,he was my best friend, and the closest thing to me in since I was 3. got me. I didn\u2019t think it would hit me this hard, but it did. Now, here\u2019s the thing,my older brother (20M) is the stereotypical \u201ctough guy.\u201d , super popular, full of confidence, high school musical typa shit. But he also has a bad habit of dismissing anything that doesn\u2019t fit into his worldview. We\u2019ve never been THAT close,he thinks I\u2019m too sensitive, and I think he\u2019s a bit of an ass,but I genuinely thought he\u2019d understand how much romeo meant to me. I mean, even if he didn\u2019t care about romeo, he could have at least respected that I did, right? You guessed it,he didnt\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb Yesterday, I was sitting in the living room, looking through old photos of romeo on my phone and tbh i was crying. I thought I was alone. Then my brother walked in, took one look at me, and started laughing menacingly( literally it sounded like doflamingo from one piece). He said things like: you really cryin' over a dog? and man up, it's just an animal. I tried to ignore him at first and asked him to stop, but that just seemed to make him more of an asshole. He kept going, saying things like,  Whats next? you gonna hold a funeral for him? and even pretended to cry in a mocking way. I don\u2019t know what changed in me, but I snapped. I was hurt, angry, and just so fed up with how shitty he was being. I remembered that not long ago, his girlfriend of two years had broken up with him. Ever since, he\u2019s been moping around the house, blasting sad breakup songs, and talking to anyone who\u2019ll listen about how \u201cheartbroken\u201d he is. So I looked him dead in the eye and said, at least my 'just an animal loved me, your girl clearly didnt love you the way she cheated on you, at least my dog died loving me, your girl is still alive and didnt love you He froze, completely silent. Then his face went red, and he stormed out of the room without saying a word. Fast forward to later, my parents heard about what happened (thanks to him, ofc) and told me I was out of line. They said I went too far and that I should apologize because what I said was cruel. But here\u2019s the thing,I don\u2019t feel like I owe him an apology. He mocked me while I was grieving, dismissed my feelings, and only stopped when I hit him where it hurt. I know what I said was harsh. I know it wasn\u2019t the nicest thing I could\u2019ve said. But honestly? He started it. If he\u2019d just shown me a shred of emotion,or even left me alone,I wouldn\u2019t have gone there. Now my parents are pressuring me to \u201cmake things right\u201d with him, but I don\u2019t see why I should have to apologize when he was the one who started being shitty first. AITA? UPDATE!!!!!!!:long story short i think my parents had a talk with him and if not he just came to his senses. He came and knocked on my door and i opened, he gave me the biggest hug he's ever given me in such a long time, it was much needed for both of us. He apologized and told me how he realized how much of an asshole he was being and that he has changed a lot into the worse and has just realized it. I apologized as well for reminding him of his girlfriend(and roasting the shit out of him). We legitimately had some bonding time where we kept apologizing and played fifa and just talked EVERYTHING out. And we both agreed to try ro be better with each other AND our parents and just try to become the best versions of ourselves. I was genuinely so flabbergasted that he actually did that because i haven't seen my brother show emotions in a long time. But these two days have somehow changed him and I'm not complaining. Thank you so much everyone for the advice,i really appreciate it and im so grateful for everyone who cared to read and comment, reading these positive comments made my week and made me know how i was right AND wrong and what i can do to improve myself. Again, thank you guys\ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffb\ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffb another edit: we actually ARE gonna make a funeral for romeo. ",

        "selftext": "I f22 asked my boyfriend m20 to make me tacos for when I got home later that night. I asked him to brown the ground beef and follow the instructions.  He doesn\u2019t really cook but I thought the task was simple enough. So I get home a few hours after he made the beef and things are going well. I quickly chopped the veggies so we could assemble the tacos. I thanked him for making it for me and we started eating.  I ate a bite and it tasted really bland and a bit chalky so I asked if he followed the instructions. He said, \u201cNo I just threw it together with some seasoning.\u201d So I asked him why he didn\u2019t follow the instructions and he said, \u201cI didn\u2019t know what instructions you meant.\u201d He could\u2019ve asked me what instructions? Googled it? Looked on the seasoning packet?  Anyways I am kind of a picky eater and I only eat food that tastes good. If food is just meh I would rather not eat it and he knows this. Also I cook different dishes for him all the time and do my best to make sure they taste as good as possible. So I said, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you look for the instructions or ask me?\u201d and he said, \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d This is when I got really upset and left the room. He soon followed me and said, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong.\u201d Probably thinking I was overreacting. Then I told him, \u201cI asked you to do one thing and told you to follow the instructions and you didn\u2019t do it, and you know I only eat food that tastes good. I try hard to make you good food all the time and I just wanted you to do it for me one time and you didn\u2019t even try.\u201d He kinda got defensive and said he thought it was simple and made it how he thought it was made. He said sorry and that he should\u2019ve known better, but now I feel kinda guilty and like an ungrateful bitch. AITA? EDIT: by \u201ci only eat good food\u201d i mean that i take meds and a side effect is low appetite so i only can eat if its the exact thing im craving or something cooked really well. the food he made was flavorless so i was disappointed bc i wanted the meat seasoned w the taco packet  UPDATE: We talked about it and he meant that he doesn\u2019t care about how food tastes. He made tacos before like this so he thought he already knew how to do it thats why he didn\u2019t look at the instructions and he thought it was fine. He said he will do a better job next time. Also he does clean up for me about half of the time so he does do things for me but I know I am particular about my food so usually I cook. However I was getting home late that night and I wanted something to be ready for when I got back, that\u2019s why I asked him. I also thought he could do it because he is a very smart guy and builds furniture for a living (he can follow instructions). Also I ended up just adding more seasoning and water so it is edible now. I just was tired after a long day and frustrated so I was being a bit critical and didn\u2019t want to fix it in that moment. But we are very happy and he is good to me! This was a little bickering moment and it wasn\u2019t that serious of an issue, but I wanted to know if I was being unreasonable or if he really didn\u2019t care about me. Now I think it was just a mishap and I could\u2019ve been nicer about the delivery. ALSO I wasn\u2019t mad that it didn\u2019t taste good! If he followed instructions and somehow it was terrible i would have been totally fine with it and would have helped him make it another time to teach him. I was upset because I asked him to follow the instructions on the pack and he didn\u2019t listen. And he knows that i am limited in what i can eat due to my meds and he didn\u2019t put consideration into that.",

I returned from visiting family for the holidays and I noticed the blade of my blender was severely damaged (like wavy with large burrs), and the body had 4-5 deep gouge marks in the plastic. I asked her about the damage and she explained that she hadn\u2019t touched the blender, but had lent it out two times while i was away. I told her I wish she would have asked before loaning it out and I suggested she give me money to replace it ($175 which is a ton of money for both of us), and she agreed. Now she is having second thoughts and doesn\u2019t think its fair and seems to be hinting that maybe the damage was there before she lent it out, which besides being unprovable, I feel confident that it wasn\u2019t like this before i left for the holidays. I fear that this conflict will escalate by nature of her suggesting an unprovable alternate scenario and at the core, I just don\u2019t want her to lend out my valuables without asking. Additionally this isn\u2019t the first thing she has damaged or broken or lost of mine, but it is the first time ive ever asked for her to replace something. This situation just kind of crossed a threshold for me and I truly felt resolve when she took accountability and agreed to replace the damaged one. Now that she is revealing second thoughts, I feel really confused and sad and hyper-vigilant and insecure in my home. ",

For some reason, this caused me to snap because I am tired of being accused of something that literally isn\u2019t true and making me feel really shitty about myself. After I told her off, she shoved past me and hasn\u2019t spoken to me since. AITA in this situation?",

It all started when I kept finding her rummaging through my clothes on multiple ocassions (I don't WFH and she doesn't have a job).. then I started to notice my clothes go missing and I noticed she was slowly throwing my clothes away. I don't make a lot so it was really upsetting to me to see my clothes in the trash (that's when I put 2 and 2 together). After that I confronted her and asked her to please stop. She claimed the clothes were too revealing for someone who will be a part of her family (they are lulu lemon athletic clothes I wear to the gym.) I told her I can wear what I want but that I will refrain from wearing the clothes in front of her. She stopped throwing the clothes out for a while but then started up again and this time she actually started cutting them apart and throwing them out. I had had enough and got her a hotel room and put all her stuff in there when her and my BF were out one day. Now she is going back to India and my BF is saying he's going to break up with me because I disrespected his mom. He asked me to move out (we both pay half for the rent right now) and I just feel a little guilty. I know it is disrespectful in Indian culture but AITA?

There's been several instances where a dead or dying cat has come up and I've CLEARLY stated I don't want to talk about it, change the subject. 2 big problems for me here, was the boundary I set and she ignored and second when I tried to downgrade the hostility abit by replying what just happened and WHY I'm upset, I feel like I'm being gas lit.  I said I don't want to talk about it, you ignored that and proceeded to tell me anyway, you shouldn't have. All she had to say was well that's your opinion,  I said dude just admit you're wrong,  Again was hit with well that's your opinion So long story short she says I want to be able to talk to you about anything, and If I can't I'll find someone I can talk to.

        "selftext": "My ex-husband and I share custody of our five kids (ages 8\u201316) on a week on/week off schedule, as per our divorce decree. This arrangement has worked well, especially since I started my own massage therapy business last year. However, my ex frequently demands to switch to a two weeks on/two weeks off schedule because he needs to travel out of state for work. He says it\u2019s too expensive to travel every weekend. To clarify, it\u2019s not a requirement for him to travel two weeks at a time, he\u2019s allowed to travel every other week, it just costs him more to travel four times a month instead of two. For context, his income is four times mine. I make about $30k a year, and he pays $730 a month in child support and $550 in spousal support, though the spousal support will end in 1.5 years. However, I use the spousal support on the kids anyway to help cover their expenses. Finding and paying for last-minute childcare adds up quickly. I already work fewer hours on the weeks I have the kids, but I can\u2019t make up for it by working more hours on my off weeks, my body simply can\u2019t handle it. So every time he changes the plan, it disrupts my client schedule and forces me to either reschedule appointments (potentially losing clients) or find (and pay for) last minute childcare. I\u2019ve told him I need consistency for both my business and the kids, but he argues I should be more flexible because his job is demanding. On top of that, the kids don\u2019t like the two weeks on/two weeks off arrangement. They are struggling as is with the week on/week off. They prefer to be with me, but there\u2019s nothing I can do about that. The two oldest begged to start therapy because of the stress their father causes them, so I got them into therapy. Now the third oldest is begging to start therapy too. I worry that the constant changes are detrimental to their mental health and overall stability. He doesn\u2019t believe in mental health and doesn\u2019t want them in therapy, but I digress.  I finally put my foot down and told him I won\u2019t keep adjusting the schedule. Now he\u2019s calling me selfish and says I\u2019m not considering how hard he works to provide for the kids. I feel like I\u2019m just protecting my business and the kids' mental health and stability. AITA?",

        "selftext": "I (25F) am child-free so maybe there is some aspect of parenthood that I\u2019m missing here. My friend Stacy (26F) had her first baby about 9 months ago,  Hailey. Stacy and I had some tension brewing in our friendship since she was pregnant. In the past, my time and energy had been very much available to Stacy. At times I felt that she took advantage of my empathy and willingness to bend over backwards for her. She lived about an hour away, and was always in some form of drama or crisis. I drove up to be with her nearly every single weekend, and the times when I told her I couldn\u2019t for one reason or another, she would beg and usually guilt me with things like \u201cI\u2019m in such a dark place, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll do if I\u2019m alone, I really need this\u201d. She also did a lot of passive aggressive shutting down from conversation when she didn\u2019t get what she wanted, leading me to always give in and put my own needs aside. This went on for years. I grew tired of this pattern and started therapy, where I learned to set healthy boundaries, speak up, and prioritize myself when it was important. These changes led me to cut the weekends I spent with her in half. I was in the process of buying a house, starting a new job and masters program, on top of family issues. I knew that she saw the change in our friendship and wasn\u2019t happy about it, but thought that with time she would understand and adjust. She never did, and insinuated that I changed because I didn\u2019t support her pregnancy or because my partner was manipulating me into not spending time with her. I explained to her many times that this wasn\u2019t the case and that I am doing all I can to be there for her.  Things came to a head when I had a health scare. I told her about it, and the next day she tried to call me. I was on the phone with someone else and couldn\u2019t answer, but texted her immediately after to let her know and make sure that everything was okay. She once again got upset because I didn\u2019t answer right away, and I had had it. On the very rare occasion that I ask for support from her she had to make it about herself. I didn\u2019t usually call her out but this time I did. I told her I didn\u2019t understand why she had an attitude, she said \u201cthanks for making me cry\u201d and then didn\u2019t respond to me for over a month. Then, when she finally did, she didn\u2019t ask about my health. She didn\u2019t apologize or even bother explaining. She instead accused me of using her daughter as a pawn by not acknowledging her. She said that Hailey didn\u2019t deserve absolutely no effort just because her and I were in a fight, and that it was so messed up that I would add Hailey into the equation. I\u2019m so confused. Hailey had nothing to do with the fight, and Stacy was the one who had ignored me for over a month. What was I supposed to do in this scenario? I can\u2019t text a 9 month old or just show up at their house. I\u2019m genuinely lost, can someone please explain this to me? AITA? \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-(EDIT) Update:Thank you for all of the comments and advice! I especially appreciate the vulnerablility of those who shared their experiences from both sides of this situation. Stacy and I have been friends for a decade, and I have long speculated that Stacy\u2019s behavior stems from her past traumas and mental health. This is a huge reason I could never bring myself to abandon her or criticize the ways she copes with life, albeit unhealthy. Although I can empathize with her experience and care about her deeply, you all helped me see that with no end in sight, it\u2019s not a sustainable friendship for me to continue. I decidedly to be brutally honest with Stacy and of course, things ended in flames. I explained that her using Hailey to guilt trip me was manipulative and crossed the line, and that it is reflective of her behavior toward me throughout our friendship. I have done my best to be a good friend but find it impossible to meet the expectations she has for me that she doesn\u2019t even seem to apply to herself. I initially said I needed some distance from her, but her response was even worse than I imagined possible and the situation is now irredeemable. Some of my favorite lines were \u201cit is all about me and my family, get that through your f*cking head\u201d and \u201cif you don\u2019t want to be my doormat, don\u2019t let the door hit you on the way out.\u201d As well as letting me know what other people say about me behind my back and that I was meant to be Hailey\u2019s godmother but she couldn\u2019t bring herself to ask me because of what an absent friend I am. She has been blocked. I\u2019m devastated and relieved, and know I\u2019m not totally blameless for remaining silent and letting resentment build for so long. Thank you Reddit!",

        "selftext": "I split up with my ex almost 2 years ago. My child started school the same year.  My ex was never too involved in our child's educational needs- even when she was a toddler. I handled it all myself. My child school offers multiple apps and websites. You can be up to date with everything without ever having to contact anyone, I asked my ex repeatedly to get at least the main apps, so that I don't have to keep reminding him of important dates and our child's progress,. He didn't care. Just a few examples: - whenever I asked to make a plan for any school break, he'd ask WHEN the school break is. I sent him links to the school website, but he couldn't even be bothered to save a screenshot/ make a note of the dates etc. so he'd ask again next time around too. - He couldn't be bothered to update his phone number in the school records, so the office couldn't contact him during an emergency. - I informed him about all parent teacher meetings- he said he couldn't make it, and that it made sense for me to go because he didn't know the teachers... even in September, when neither of us knew the NEW teachers. [side note: he doesn't work, I do, so I thought it was logical to have him attend, so I wouldn't have to take time off work to do so] - I'd send him any important dates- school plays, any shows, sports events etc.- he'd pick and choose the ones not involving much interaction- reading together on the world book day was a no go, but watching the kids race was okay etc. - I'd even invite him to events organized by any clubs my kids is in (clubs I organized and paid for myself), but he always had an excuse unless the events fell on his weekends, even then he'd sometimes ask me to swap the weekends. I accepted it for over a year for the sake of peace. I wanted my kid to see her dad support her achievements too. But it's been so long and I'm just tired of having to both handle the responsibility AND remember to give him updates about it. It also felt like I was trying to make him involved when he clearly wasn't interested... So last autumn I announced to him, that it was on him to stay up to date with our child's school stuff. I gave him 2 weeks to get everything sorted. I even listed all the important apps / websites so he wouldn't miss anything (the only one I didn't share was a payment portal, as I knew he wouldn't care about that one). I promised to still share any information passed via written notes / letters etc., as obviously he would not have access to those otherwise. I followed through with it. It took him 2 months to realize what's happened and now he's furious saying that I'm using the child against him. He got his family involved and now they are all bombarding me with texts saying that I'm the asshole for doing it to him and our child. His mother also pointed out that she'd done everything herself as well and didn't involve her husband in the school stuff, so she knows it's not that hard and I'm being dramatic. AITA? ",

        "selftext": "Hello Reddit. I (21) am currently living with my parents at home to save on room and board for college. I am a full-time student, work 20+ hours a week, and consistently contribute to household chores and tasks. As a family we drink a lot of milk and go through it pretty fast. My mom (53F) has always been the one to get the groceries, but since I got my license in high school, I have as well. It is rare for my dad to get family groceries. My dad (50M) is very picky about food, and for as long as I can remember, gets very upset if he doesn't have the right drink with his food. If we have pizza, he needs Coca-Cola, if we have any dessert, he needs milk. Growing up, when we ran out of one of these drinks, it would upset him. Sometimes he would slam the front door as he left, sometimes he would leave without a word. My mom was always hurt by it, and it always confused me. Why couldn't he just drink water? Well it snowed bad this week but I was able to dig my car out of the snow and pick up some drink items. I got juice and some milk. Fast-forward to yesterday. Mom got sick, but works remote. We ran out of milk as well as other items making breakfast and coffee, so I updated our grocery app. I get out to my car and it won't start. She was running a meeting, so I text to let them know I needed to take her car, which was fine with her. It's 9:00, and my dad is still asleep, he was off work. It's 11:30, I've been enjoying a lovely day at work. My dad hadn't responded to any of the family messages, but I receive this text from him: Can you please let me know when you drink the last of the milk so I can plan accordingly for my meals? He hadn't acknowledged my car troubles or that I was at work. He woke up 4 hours after the rest of us on his day off, which is fine. I respond: Hello, good morning to you too. I understand that you're frustrated, mom or I are planning to go to the grocery store after work today. I made it to work safely and am having a nice day :) Hope you enjoy your day off\u201d His response: I'm sorry if that sounded rude. I didn't mean for it to. I would really like your help with that\u00a0**issue**. I'm glad you made it safe to work, have a good day. Fair enough. I followed up by sharing the updates I made to our grocery app.\u00a0**But Reddit, this is what I wanted to say to him:** **Thank you. I'm not sure what the issue is. I was raised to not cry over spilled milk. I am not responsible for helping you plan your meals. When we run out of my favorite drinks, I drink water and go on with my day because they are a luxury, not an essential to survive. That's more than most people have in this world, and I'm grateful. Are you?** I always want to give the benefit of the doubt, and be open to the idea that I am missing something. But I feel like there's something wrong with this behavior. So, Reddit, AITA for drinking the last of the milk and not telling my dad immediately, when he is fully capable of buying groceries himself, or drinking water when it's needed?",

We are given instructions as a whole class and the set out as a group to respective stations, where work begins such as mixing ingredients and stuff. Tanya always insisted to do divide the work so as to finish faster. She usually took the critical preparations of whatever we were preparing and she mostly messed it up, meaning our final product was way below the needed standards. She would use her disability in a subtle manner to excuse her messing up the products saying how it could be tiring to mix stuff in the position she is in, and I should just try to bear with it. So now we are always producing very shit bakes because she refuses to let me have a hand getting the ingredients together saying she doesn't want to seem like she can't keep up with the class and has something to prove. Out of everyone now I'm the only one who isn't actually gaining any skills comparing to how expensive the course is because all I'm essentially doing is cleaning up after her disastrous work and wiping surfaces. The funny thing is our station is just next to where the chef is, and he sees all these shenanigans while doing absolutely nothing. All he does is tell her how she is doing so great (*for her situation but she doesn't understand)* and this made her delusional on the quality of her work and made her insist on taking up more tasks. I got fed up because I wasn't learning anything, and significant time was passing by and i wasn't there to waste money. I spoke to the chef about the situation asking about a separation and he said it would be wrong to do that just because of her disability and it wasn't right to do so. Well, I still insisted despite him Ignoring the main issue, he gave in to my request and now I participate in the class as an individual. Tanya made it seem like I left her alone since she is disabled, and my fellow classmates now look at me like some devil with other coming up to me telling me my morals aren't right. Only a few agreed with my decision. AITAH? ",

        "selftext": "I just went for the most awkward mammogram I've ever experienced.   The nurse seemed to be getting frustrated with me for not understanding which way she wanted me to move. Part of the problem was that she did not use words like left, right, forward, backward etc. - just a lot of move this way which I struggled to interpret. She also had a very stong South African accent (i.e. a different accent to mine).   Her increasing frustration and insistence that I relax (I came in reasonably relaxed but that was long gone by this stage) of course had the opposite effect, and then when she asked me to hold my breast out of the way and I heard dress instead of breast I nearly ended up in tears when she gave up on communicating and kind of grabbed my hand to pull my breast back.   I then tried to descalate the tense situation and apologised that I am a little hard of hearing and had misheard her. She immediately became angry and said in quite a shouty voice that I should have told her this and she would have spoken in a slower and louder voice. I replied that it is not an easy thing to tell people, which seemed to anger her more. I should have said that her way of conveying instructions was also perhaps not as clear as she thought it was, but did not have the guts to say this and by now was actually quite upset. All this while I am still standing at an awkward angle with one breast wedged in the machine and the other being held back by my hand and hers.   I have never been diagnosed as hard of hearing, in fact I had a hearing test during the past year that said my hearing is good. However my children tell me I do have a hearing problem and I tend to think they might be right (even though they are horrible mumblers, ha ha!).  Anyway, I was shaking by the time I sat in my car and questioning how that all went so wrong and how I could have handled it better. AITA?",

Since we weren't receiving full support, we decided to plan the wedding ourselves and finalized the details like date, venue, catering, etc. We are not and have not asked for any financial support and they have not asked if we need help in any aspect of the planning. I also asked a family friend's daughter (4F) to be the flower girl after the engagement and her mom agreed. Fast forward about a year since the flower girl was confirmed: My boyfriend's older brother and his wife recently gave birth to a baby girl (let's call her Amy) and they have been badgering us about allowing their baby (will be 11MO by the time of the wedding), my fianc\u00e9's niece, be the flower girl. My boyfriend and I pointed out that Amy isn't guaranteed to be able to walk by that time, and Amy's father responded by saying that he could carry her down the aisle. When we initially said 'no' to that idea (as I think it's weird giving the role of a flower girl to a child that wont be physically able to do any of the normal flower girl duties and it would look ugly having a toddler walk down next to an adult holding a baby), Amy's father and Amy's grandmother kept on badgering us with the same questions: Can Amy be the flower girl?What color theme is your wedding? We'll buy a dress for Amy.Since Amy is our first and only grandchild, it's tradition for our family for her to be flower girl AITAH to reject Amy as the flower girl??? \ud83e\udd72 Here is some context:Amy's father and my boyfriend have two other siblingsAmy is currently 7MO and cannot crawl or sit up unassisted.Amy's father and Amy's grandmother make racist comments about me behind my back.",

Honestly, their marriage was extremely incompatible, and it was bound to end sooner or later. My dad took the divorce really badly, and my younger sister and I have always tried to be compassionate and understanding. However, after the divorce, he imposed this rule: we are never to meet or interact with any potential partner of my mom\u2019s. He made it clear that he doesn\u2019t want anyone else \u201ctaking the role of dad.\u201d We disagreed but went along with it to keep the peace. However, during a recent conversation, he told me he expects us to follow this rule for the rest of his life. I was dumbfounded. I asked, \u201cEven when I\u2019m 40, married, and with kids of my own, am I still not allowed to meet someone my mom has been with for years if he makes her happy?\u201d He said yes. He then added that if I did, I\u2019d \u201cstop being his daughter,\u201d and he would cut me out of his life entirely. I think his fear stems from feeling replaced, which I understand when we were younger. But at this stage in our lives, it feels absurd.

I told him I\u2019m not willing to follow this rule forever, and if he chooses to cut me off for that, it will be his decision, not mine. He called it a lack of principles and insists I would be the one responsible for ending our relationship.

The three of us, along with my parents, other aunts, cousins and grandparents (basically the whole of my dad's side of the family) are all staying in the same villa that my grandparents are paying for. By the time we go on vacation, I will be about 2 months away from 18, and my sister will be 16. However, my aunt has said that she wants an adults only bathroom, and that the bathroom will not include me or my sister. I was naturally annoyed by this, especially as it meant that me and my sister would be grouped together with my younger cousins, [4M] and [6F]. She also said that she considers an adult to be anyone above the age of 21, but I know for sure that if I was wasn't this close to being 18, she would have said an adult is anyone 18+ When I asked her why this was, she says it was because we aren't hygienic. I could understand this argument in relation to my younger cousins, seeing as they are both only recently potty trained, but I can't understand how she can apply this argument towards me, given I am probably the biggest clean-freak I know. Additionally, I can't even remember the last time I shared a bathroom with her, and I have never given her any reason to believe that I am in any way unhygienic. She has also said that she wants adults-only pool time, again not including me and my sister. If I was young enough that I required supervision or inconvenienced her in some way, I would understand, but all I am doing is sharing the same common space as her, most likely without even interacting with her. Also, this is a family holiday with my parents and grandparents, it's not like she is going to be doing anything inappropriate or unsuitable for a 16 and 17 year old. I've told her to her face that I have no intention of following any of these rules, but she seems insistent that I will. She is very stubborn, but I am also extremely stubborn, and I know for a fact that I could argue about this for as long as it takes. AITA for telling her I won't follow these rules, and WIBTA if I didn't follow them.

Amongst our friends, Elle is the only unmarried one. She's made it clear that she's unhappy with being single, sincerely hopes to get into a serious relationship, and get married sooner rather than later. I can understand her frustrations, especially since she's the only single friend, wants kids someday, and so on.    About a month ago, Elle told me that she intends to be more proactive with dating this year and asked if I had anyone to introduce her to. Unfortunately, I don't, but another friend mentioned knowing a great guy (who I happen to have met before) who's single, and looking for something serious.  Elle was introduced (via text) to the guy, and they soon started talking on the phone. Elle says he has a lot of good attributes (e.g. very educated, high salary) but she finds him completely unattractive because they're the same height (he's 5'7 and she's 5'7) and because of his darker skin tone. I tried to convince her that his height and looks shouldn't take precedence over his personality, but this soon led to a major revelation on her dating standards that left me completely dumbfounded.   Elle told me that she's only interested in men who, in her words, is an 8 or better (looks-wise),  taller than her when she's wearing heels, of a certain complexion, ideally no beard, has advanced degrees, making over $100k/year, doesn't have kids, and is currently attending church every week or every other week.  But the big kicker that got me was that she insists that she's unwilling to date a man (like...go out on dates) who won't commit to waiting until marriage for sex. Yes, she's religious but she's not a virign and has had sex in all past relationships.    According to Elle, this is a conversation that should be had before even the first date, and if the guy isn't firmly agreeing, it's a no-go. When I challenged her thoughts and logic on this, she got increasingly upset.   I told her that I think she's asking for a very tall order, making dating harder than it should be. I'm not saying she should compromise on her religious values, but I am trying to tell her that she should be more open-minded about her criteria because she's looking for a one in a million guy, while also prematurely shutting down and shutting out some potentially great guys because of their income and/or height.    Elle is now furious at me and says I'm not being a supportive friend. She says that I don't understand her faith and am being something of a Debbie Downer. AITA?",

My friend is helping me learn to fully take care of myself as well as help me learn not everything is my fault. We are getting low on food. My fh was complaining on Friday about there not being any food besides mac and cheese and potatoes. My friend brought up to him that he was only buying his work lunches and eating whatever their dad brought into the house that was actually meant for them because he had not been helping with groceries. He claimed he didn't make enough to buy food(he makes 400ish a week). I recommended the food bank since it was the second Tuesday of every month. He said he didn't want to eat that.  Me and my friend tried recommending food stamps but he shut that down. My friend can't file without him and I have no idea how to file. I gave up on talking to him and used my whole paycheck on stocking the house with as much food as I could instead of saving like I was supposed to be. I even cut down on the quality of dog food I was grabbing so I could buy more food. My friend's dad picked me up from the store and we brought the food home and I had a good amount of food and drinks to last awhile. He got pissed when he saw the food and complained about how I didn't get any real food.  I'm mostly vegetarian and my friend has eating issues related to textures, so I bought all safe foods and no real meat because meat was frankly way too expensive. I brought this up but he said I was being selfish and should have bought the meat anyway and cut out some of my stuff. He wouldn't listen when I explained that I looked at the meat and there was no way I could get meat and provide for everyone with the money I had.  I only had 250 to get food for 2 weeks AND food for the animals. I hadn't planned on spending the whole 250 I had originally planned on 100 on groceries and 70 on the dogs so I would have enough to fix some of them. I didn't have enough to cater to everyone but I did what I could. He's making me feel like an ass. He sold 2 of his consoles and got himself more food but keeps pouting about how little he could buy with what he got and the fact he has only has 1 console left. I feel bad for him having to sell his stuff to get meat. My friend is mad at their husband telling him to be grateful, my brain is saying I fucked up again. I feel like an ass with how he's acting. Adding this I don't care if you eat meat! I just feel sick after eating alot of it so I gave up and went on a mostly veg diet. I do not care that he eats meat I just care about the fact he threw a fit and acts like I did something wrong by not buying the meat when I hadn't even planned to spend that much. I am not asking for money. I have a job I am happy with I don't make alot of money but I make enough to take care of mine and my friends pups and enough where I can eat and afford my share of the bills.  Edit: I am adding this. PLEASE STOP TELLING ME TO GET RID OF MY DOGS. One of them is an ESA i need to function like a normal human being. She helps me with my anxiety and paranoia. She helps me know when I'm having an anxiety spike and just hearing things that aren't there when I'm alone. I need this dog. Adding more because someone thinks this is a larp? Don't know what that is. I'm not dating my friend I'm nonbinary and into girls and other nonbinary people. Men are not on my list of attractions at all. We live in a house it's not the best but it fricken works. The dogs were not fricken bought they were an accidental litter that was unexpected.

Keep in mind, I have gained a bit of weight since the last time they have seen me and I\u2019m quite out of shape and struggling to keep up when we start the practice. My coach says welcome back and hugs me and stuff and he basically catches me up on everything that\u2019s happened, what I\u2019ve missed, etc. Then we start the warm up, it was quite difficult for me as I haven\u2019t swam in almost 2 months.

We get out of the water for the coach to explain the main set and the coaches assistant (I think she\u2019s 38F but idk for sure) says \u201cit\u2019s a pity your dad couldn\u2019t have died a little later to save you from this practice\u201d and she starts laughing and I\u2019m fuming at this point. I tell her to PO and to not talk about things like that and I left early. My mum has called the coach and told him that what was said today was unacceptable, and that she thinks it\u2019s disgusting that an adult who I should view as an authority figure to trust and look up to would say such things. AITA?",

She got mad when I reminded her and then even more mad at me when I found out how much I owed now because of her (almost $1000 which she said it was only that much because of fees and stuff) and told her how much it was. I found out that she hadn\u2019t made a payment since February and it was then December. I politely asked her to pay it off and she blew up at me. I knew that she was having financial trouble so I hadn\u2019t been very aggressive in reminding her and asking her about it. She then held things over my head that she pays for and said that she should have taken them away to pay the card off.  Later she offered to only offer the partial amount to the card company and hope that they would forgive everything. I went to my aunt for advice because I was staying with her because my mother said she didn\u2019t want me to come home. She offered to pay off the full amount of the card and I accepted. Now my mother is even more mad at me because the family knows what she did now. She is also saying that I don\u2019t care about her because I did this.",

        "selftext": "So I come from a culture where it is common for the woman\u2019s mother to stay with her and assist her during the end of pregnancy, the birth and the first few weeks after the baby is born until she fully recovers and is able to care for the baby unassisted. My mom has always talked about wanting to do this for me. This is my first pregnancy so while I am very nervous when I announced it I knew my mom was looking forward to helping me through this phase as I am her only daughter. My brother and SIL already have one child and she found out she was pregnant with her second and was due soon after me.  My SIL and I have a great relationship and when she had her first child she chose to have it in our home country where her parents are. She had the same support from her own mother at the time and even extra support from other relatives including my mom. Although I live in the US I went to visit her and help in any way I could because she felt that was important (I did too). Since then, she and my brother have moved to the US for career reasons (me, brother and SIL are all citizens but all of our parents live in our home country). They decided to stay in the US to have their second child. We are both due soon and unfortunately, her parents had some visa processing issues and cannot come in time for the delivery or shortly after. My mom however got approved and was planning to stay with me as we had discussed before.  My brother asked my mom the other day if she could come help my SIL out for the delivery as her parents could not make it and she is expected to deliver 1-2 weeks after me. When she told me I (under the assumption I would have already delivered by then) told her that I think it makes sense for her to fly out briefly for the delivery and the initial nights but that she should come back soon after. When my SIL heard this she was upset and said that she doesn\u2019t have any family here and my mom was the only family she had and that she should atleast be able to stay for the same 1-2 weeks that she is expected to help me out post partum before my SIL\u2019s due date. I countered by saying that I feel awful that her parents couldn\u2019t make it in time and that\u2019s why I\u2019m fine with my mother leaving for a few days to help her out but that this is my first pregnancy and I always thought my mom would be there in the way that we have always wanted and that at the very least she has been around the block before.  Now my mom doesn\u2019t know what to do and I think she feels guilty. She has a good relationship with both me and SIL and doesn\u2019t want to upset anyone. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m being selfish here so AITA? Edit: just splitting the post into paragraphs for better readability. Sorry about that! Thanks for pointing that out.  Edit 2: After reading some comments I want to clarify a few things: 1. Both SIL and I have supportive partners who will be taking time off regardless. It is not about that. In my culture and many others, childbirth is something where the women in our community come together to help. After growing up and leaving your parent\u2019s house this is really one of the few moments you can feel like you need your mom again and have that bonding moment. I\u2019m sure we both would manage if we only had our partners but it\u2019s not just about that for us. If worse comes to worse and we both have difficult deliveries that require that kind of support then my own MIL could be there for me then. In the scenario described above where one of us do not necessarily need my mom there more than the other I would prefer to experience this phase with my own mother. I do not have a bad relationship with my own MIL but we have a good understanding of our boundaries and I would not feel as comfortable asking for the same things or being as vulnerable as I would be with my own mother especially during a time where emotions are high and hormones are fluctuating.  2.  For the people saying that both I and SIL are entitled or taking advantage of my mom, I want to stress that she WANTS to do this. Not just because of culture or an expectation but because she is very passionate about pregnancy and childcare and has always told me she has been looking forward to having that moment with me when I have a baby. Back in our home country she has done this for countless and more distantly related women in our community and feels empowered by it.  3. Our due dates are about 11 days apart so I said 1-2 weeks to account for some buffer time. The people a saying that either of us could deliver early or late are correct. As of now we are both having healthy pregnancies and expected to deliver close to the due date and what I told her was simply under the conditions that we do deliver 1-2 weeks within each other without major complications. If the situation changes I am open to changing my perspective. ",

        "selftext": "Am I the asshole Navy Shower Edition. I (33F) am married to my husband (42M). We have two young boys under 5 and live out of state from my parents. It's about a three hour drive to their house and we visit fairly often. They have a larger home in a beautiful neighborhood and they have very well paying jobs. Since we have young kids, we often stay for the whole weekend. My dad (58M) is ex-military and grew up taking Navy Showers as he calls them. My grandfather always made my dad and his brothers as well as anyone else who stayed at their house take them as well. It's essentially a regular shower except you turn the water off when you're soaping yourself up and shampooing your hair. So you'll turn the water on to start the shower then turn the water off to soap up and shampoo your hair and then turn the water back on to rinse off. My grandfather always said it saved tons of water and was efficient. Growing up, I always thought it was ridiculous because it just meant you were standing there freezing while the water was off for half your shower. My dad always rolled his eyes over it too. Just this past weekend though, he told my husband and I that we needed to start taking navy showers when we visited. He said my husband takes too long of a shower while he's there and it's wasting water so he wants us both to do them. He and my mom both shower that way everyday because he believes it saves water and is better for their septic system. It should be noted that my husband is not taking long, luxurious showers for fun. He is balding and shaves his head in the shower every morning to prevent stubble. His showers are roughly 20 minutes long and again, it's because he has to shave his head. Anyway, my dad told us this and we both politely said okay. However, later in the day he brought it up again and I told him I thought it was a little ridiculous to stand in a freezing shower without water just to save, at most, 2 minutes worth of water. Not to mention my husband would be turning the water on and off every time he needed to rinse his razor. My dad just repeated that we, but especially my husband, takes too long of a shower. He claims my husband takes 30-45 minute showers while he\u2019s there. I explained that my husband has never taken that long of a shower and that it\u2019s a little weird to be monitoring the length of our showers. I told him that it makes us both, but especially my husband, feel awkward and we both feel like we are being judged. He wouldn\u2019t budge and just repeated he wanted us to shower that way while at his house because he believed it was better. We, of course, respected what he said and did the navy showers this weekend, but AITA or is it actually a ridiculous request?  It should also be noted that we all live in the Midwest and it was 12 degrees out this weekend with snow and they keep their house at 67 in the winter so standing in a shower when you\u2019re completely wet without the water running really sucks. My parents are well off so it\u2019s not a money issue either. I don\u2019t mention them being well off to say that therefore money doesn\u2019t matter. I just wanted to provide context.  Edit: my husband and I both respect my dad a lot and will absolutely follow the navy shower rule when we are there. I'm actually very close with my dad and he and I have always had a great relationship. I am in no way going to disrespect his rules or stop visiting. I am not even angry about the new rule. At the end of the day, it\u2019s their house and my husband and I respect them enough to follow it. I just think it\u2019s a weird request from them.  Edit 2: I know 20 minutes isn't a quick shower. I take about 5 minute showers myself.  Edit 3: My kids and I visit frequently, but my husband only stays overnight 1-2 times per year. He has a crazy work schedule so he\u2019s not able to come for overnights as often so his showering habits are only an issue 1-2 times per year. ",

        "selftext": "I (23F) am going to be a bridesmaid in my fianc\u00e9\u2019s older sister\u2019s wedding, which is set for October 2025. While I\u2019m excited to be part of her big day, I\u2019ve been a bridesmaid before and know how expensive it can be. The costs for this wedding are piling up quickly. I\u2019ve already paid $300 for the bridesmaid dress, the required shoes, and $1,000 for the destination bachelorette trip. Initially, we were told there was no pressure to attend, but her mom later said it was \u201cshitty\u201d that some bridesmaids were considering skipping due to the cost, so I felt pressured to go. After we booked the trip, the maid of honor informed us that we would also be covering all of the bride\u2019s costs during the trip\u2014food, drinks, and anything else. This was never discussed beforehand and added another unexpected expense on top of an already expensive trip. My future MIL mentioned that, as a bridesmaid, I\u2019m expected to help pay for the bridal shower. She said she Googled it and found that the bridesmaids are responsible for the costs, not her as the mother of the bride. In all the weddings I\u2019ve been part of, the bridal shower costs were primarily covered by family or a family friend who volunteered to host it at their home. The bridesmaids usually helped with smaller things like games and decorations. I don\u2019t mind contributing to the bridal shower, but it needs to be within reason. With everything else I\u2019ve already paid for, it\u2019s becoming unmanageable\u2014especially since I\u2019m trying to save for my own wedding, which is planned for mid-2026. My future SIL is expecting a fully catered bridal shower with elaborate d\u00e9cor, which feels unrealistic for a group of bridesmaids to fund. It also seems like she\u2019s picking things that aren\u2019t even within her budget and assuming others will cover the difference. Am I the asshole for wanting to set boundaries around the bridal shower costs, especially when it feels like at every turn an unexpected expense comes up without any discussion? I know weddings are expensive (as I am currently planning one), but how much is too much to ask your bridesmaids to pay? In previous weddings I was a bridesmaid in, I would spend about $1,200 total! In this case, that\u2019s not even covering the bachelorette trip. I do want to make this whole thing special for her, but it\u2019s just starting to get very costly and I know the other bridesmaids are feeling the pressure too. We are all young and just starting our careers.  EDIT: I\u2019ve already spoken to my fianc\u00e9 about this and he agrees it\u2019s out of line. He has my back on however I choose to approach this and was curious to see everyone\u2019s responses and advice. We are a young couple and are open to advice on how to handle this. He\u2019s already offered to speak to his family, but based on prior situations, he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019ll go anywhere. The two of us have drawn our lines on these matters on previous issues, and in fact moved further away to really separate into our own family while in pursuit of our careers. ",

        "selftext": "I\u2019m an 18-year-old female. My best friend, Sarah, started dating someone online a few months ago, and it has changed our relationship dynamic. We've been arguing frequently due to misunderstandings. I asked her parents if I could fly up to see her for her birthday, and they paid for the tickets despite my offer to cover it myself. However, Sarah told me she planned to spend most of her time on the phone with her boyfriend and might kick me out of her room. This made me reconsider the trip, as I wanted to visit her, not just be a third wheel. After a misunderstanding, she clarified that she would call him during downtime and spend holidays with him, which seemed fair. We hung up, but then her boyfriend texted me (he already had my number) about Sarah having a bad day and said my uncertainty about visiting made it worse. I felt this was inappropriate and told him to mind his business. Sarah then told me I couldn't speak to him that way and that she had given him permission to text me the message.  I was shocked and explained that he crossed a boundary. She responded that her business was his, which made me feel disrespected. I had her parents cancel my tickets, but I expressed gratitude for their support. I felt uncomfortable visiting, especially with the potential for further arguments and disrespect for my boundaries. Sarah defended her boyfriend, saying he was just trying to help and that she really wanted me there for her birthday. She was upset that I won\u2019t be there, expressing that it hurt her deeply, especially since she had fought her dad for months to be able to visit me (though he ultimately said no). I reminded her that I had to remind her about my own birthday during a busy time when she was moving. She said it will take a long time for her to get over the hurt of me choosing not to visit.  I think I might be the asshole because at the end of the day it is her 18th birthday and I don\u2019t want her to hold this over my head.   I don\u2019t want to be in an environment where I might argue again, and I\u2019d rather focus on my own life and obligations. Given the situation, do you think I did anything wrong? AITA for canceling my trip to see my best friend for her 18th birthday? (Edit: they both met because I introduced them. He and I ran gaming channels and he messaged me to collaborate.

        "selftext": "I have a roommate who pays me about 90% of half the rent\u2014so if the total rent is $1,600, they contribute around $700. I cover the rest, along with water, gas, internet, and electricity, because I earn more than they do. When they first moved in, I felt sorry for them because they were leaving an abusive situation. It\u2019s been a little over a year since they moved into my guest room, and overall, it hasn\u2019t been too bad. However, when they moved in, I had some of my belongings in the closet\u2014primarily books. The room is fully furnished with my furniture, including a large bed that takes up a lot of space, a heavy bookshelf, and around 500 books stored in 5\u20136 boxes and two large bags. I always intended to go through them, pick out my favorites, and donate or sell the rest, but due to my ADHD and object impermanence, I kept pushing it off. In the long run, I envisioned turning the room into a closet/library after they moved out since I prefer having my clothes visible rather than stored away. Last year, I came home to find my bookshelf outside by the dumpsters. I immediately told my roommate to put it back in the room because they had no right to throw away my belongings. If they had asked, I would have found another place for it, but I was so frustrated that I insisted they return it to the room without offering an alternative solution. Fast forward to now: I recently hired someone to help clean my apartment when work gets too busy. They offered to organize my cabinets, which reminded me to finally sort through my books\u2014only to be told that my roommate had thrown them all away months ago. Over 500 books\u2014hardcover, paperback, large, small, books I had kept since middle school\u2014just gone. They never asked, never mentioned feeling uncomfortable with them in the closet, never gave me a chance to move them. They simply decided to discard decades of my history without my permission. I was so upset that I haven\u2019t spoken to them in over a week. It\u2019s not just about the books\u2014it\u2019s about the complete lack of respect for my things. My first instinct is to kick them out (yes, I understand the legal complexities of tenancy and eviction), but instead, I\u2019ve decided that I no longer want to cover the bulk of the bills. I\u2019ve drafted a document that evenly splits all household expenses, which will increase their contribution by at least $500. WIBTA if I taped it to their door? This isn\u2019t the arrangement we originally agreed upon when they moved in, but at this point, I feel that if they can blatantly disrespect my belongings, they no longer deserve my generosity. ",

I've been happy for the most part. I love my step dad and my siblings (have some on both sides). My only issue has been my step mom.  Tbh, I wouldn't say I had any real issues in the past. I do find her more annoying with more strict rules then what I have at my moms house (She's a Vice Principal, very serious) , but recently, she has been taking shots to my dad and I about my mom and step dad. (Which might have always been a thing, but now that I'm older she is just doing it more infront of me?)  Saying things like she doesn't take my education seriously, she's never grown up, they flaunt their money in front of her and my dad, they spoil me, they let me get away with everything. I honestly don't even know where she comes up with this. My dad doesn't really say anything, agrees occasionally, but it's been making me angrier and angrier.  Obviously, I would never admit it to my dad, but I do love my mom more. She is like the most awesome and important person to me, and hearing my step mom say crap just made me boil over....... I finally broke and yelled at her after she blamed my mom for me getting a poor mark on an exam. I told her to shut her mouth about my mom and that if she said one more word, I would pack a bag and stay with my mom permanently. My dad flipped and yelled at me to apologize, but I told him if he didn't make her apologize that I was leaving. He said my mom would never allow it, and I made the mistake of saying we talked about it before.  He then called my mom and started a fight with her..... thinking she put me up to this. I couldn't handle it, so I left the house and called my step dad to come get me.  I've been at my mom's, but my dad's been texting and calling every day, jumping from begging me to come home, apologizing, to getting into fights with my mom and step dad. I feel like an asshole for causing a huge fight between my families..... Edit: Thank you everyone for the replies so far. I know I shouldn't have said it was something my mom and I talked about. We did a few years ago when I was like 12 when I wanted to stay longer at my moms and had like a moment where I got upset and told her it was hard sometimes not seeing her for a week, but that was the only time it was ever mentioned. So I feel like an ass for saying it.  As for people asking me about custody agreements, I don't think there is any? They had me really young (20 years old) and they split when I was a baby. I was with my mom all the time till I was 3 or 4 and then I started spending more consecutive days with my dad. My mom also has never asked my dad for child support and tbh I don't think she would even if I stayed full time.  Update*  So I have spoken with my mom about it and it probably made me more mad at the situation. She didn't have a bad word to say about my Dad or my Step Mom. I told her what that were saying about her and SHE apologized to me. Saying she loves me, that she's sorry I had be apart of those conversations, that she has big shoulders and can take the criticism and will make it clear to my Dad and Step Mom that if they have concerns that they can address it with her and my Step Dad and leave me out of it. That she would love to have me full time but doesn't want me to make a decision to not see my dad and my other siblings (who I do miss) because of her.  I told her I can't stand the way they talk about her and she didn't really say anything, just kind of started crying, saying I had a big heart and that she loved me. She told me she will deal with my dad and to let her know when I'm ready to talk to him about the situation. ",

        "selftext": "A couple of months ago,I and five of my friends planned a holiday together for Berlin. One of my friends, let's call him James, decided it would be easier if he booked all of the accommodation and we sent him the money for it. We all agreed to this, and I planned to pay for it at the end of the month after I had gotten paid. However, a week before the trip was to begin, I was no longer able to attend however I promised to pay in full for my part. However, this is where my other friend, Peter, gets involved. He was part of the original planning of the trip but decided he could not afford it and was thus not included in the booking. However, once he heard that I was unable to attend but still paying for the room James had booked, he said he wanted to go. Naturally, everyone agreed that he could and so I didn't pay for my part assuming that Peter would cover it. He did not. The trip went off without a hitch, however, upon return, James asked me when I was going to be able to pay him back. I was confused because I hadn't gone on the trip and said that it was Peter's responsibility which made Peter very upset. He said that because I had agreed to go on the trip and had cancelled with such short notice that it was my job to pay for it as if he hadn't decided to go, the room would have been empty and a waste of money. He argued that because I make more money than him and he couldn't afford to pay for the accommodation, it was my fault and I shouldn't have planned the trip if I couldn't keep my promises. I would have no problem paying James for the money he spent on the room if it had remained empty but the fact that Peter saw that as his chance to have a cheaper holiday is causing me to refuse. As a result of this, James is no longer talking to either of us saying he will once we can start acting like adults and someone pays him the money. Am I in the wrong? Edit: names changed to improve clarity  Edit 2: to clarify as to why James couldn't cancel the booking, the booking was for a shared six person room so if he cancelled it would not have been possible to rebook",

        "selftext": "!Small update! Thank you everyone for all your comments! They really opened my eyes. No plans are set in stone at the moment that was just the estimate they gave him for the service. After talking to him tonight and explaining that I will NOT be footing the bill for any sort of big expensive funeral, he left the apartment, after a long argument, to stay with his grandmother and basically hasn\u2019t spoke to me since. We don\u2019t have any combined finances/accounts so at this point I\u2019m just over it and he can stay gone for all I care.  New to Reddit so forgive me for any formatting issues. To make a long story short my (31) fianc\u00e9's (35) mother recently passed. She was never really in his life (abandoned him at birth) and l've only met her one time in the 8 years we've been together. Recently she had come back into his life and they were on civil terms. We got news from the hospital that she had died and they immediately wanted to know what funeral home we wanted to send her to and of course my fianc\u00e9 decides he's obligated to figure all of this out since his other siblings are MIA or incarcerated. I recommended to him we just do something simple and keep it on the cheaper side since no one else will be helping financially and he doesn't have any savings either she also didn't have any kind of life/burial insurance. Well today he surprises me after work with a 10k bill that he expects me to pay the majority of out of my savings because he can't afford it. I will admit I did help pay for his dad's cremation multiple years ago but it wasn't near the cost of what he's wanting to do now. We just recently moved into a more expensive apartment and at this point a 10 thousand dollar funeral is just not on the table but he won't budge.",

        "selftext": "I (24f) have been friends with a girl that I'll call Hayley (24f) since high school. For a few years we didn't get to see each other much because we went to college on opposite sides of the country, but I moved to her city last year so we really got to catch up with each other.  Hayley will be turning 25 in a week so we - along with some other friends - started planning her birthday party a while ago. She wanted to have a rather big party so that she could invite all of her friends groups, but we couldn't find anywhere to have it and she lives in a small apartment. I on the other hand have a house, it's not that big but it's big enough to host the party. So our friends started bringing it up and said that we could throw the party at my house.  I was fine with that. I did find it kinda weird that they were the one to bring it up, because I personally wouldn't suggest throwing a party in someone else's house unless they were the one to suggest it, but it didn't really matter. So I said yes, my only conditions were that the party didn't turn into chaos, that no one got too drunk, and that they helped me clean up the next day. Everyone was fine with that so we agreed on it.  Yesterday, Hayley sent me a text to tell me how many people would be there. That's when she asked me if I could get my cat out of the house for the night, because one of her friends from college is allergic. I told her that I didn't have anywhere else to leave him, but that I could make sure that he stayed upstairs while we were downstairs. I also told her that my cat is very shy and easily scared so there's no way he'd get close to her friend.  She then told me that I could just leave him with my parents and then go back to get him the next day. My parent's house is about an hour and a half drive and there's just no way I'd drive a total of 6 hours in one weekend. I told her that it really wasn't possible for me to leave him with my parents but that he would be locked upstairs and I'd deep clean the house to make sure there's no cat hair anywhere. I also told her that she should've told me earlier and I could've found another solution, but now the party is in less than a week.   She told me that I wasn't being helpful and that I was ruining her party, and she's been bitching about me to a lot of our mutual friends. I told her that I had no obligation to let her do the party at my house and I kindly accepted to do so, so the least she could do was to be grateful. She hasn't replied since. Most of our friends agree with me, but I also feel a bit guilty. I don't know if I'm in the wrong here and I don't know what else I can do.  ",

I\u2019ve been trying to sell this tv that works perfectly fine for a bit now and I have a video of it being turned on and off on the post. The last times I turned it on which was this morning it worked perfect not even a scratch on it. My partner and I both carry it to our Kia soul that had the seats down so we could lay it flat screen facing up to not scratch it or break it and transported it to the meet up place. I sell it to this person and my partner and I watch as this person is shoving a 55inch tv SCREEN DOWN into the backseat of a Kia optima that has a car seat in it. I asked her at least 4 times if she needed/wanted my help and she repeatedly told me NO. I got into our car and my partner and I both agreed that this person just broke the screen of the perfectly good tv I just sold them.They texted me and told me the screen was broken and I replied with \u201cThe screen wasn't broken when we gave it to you so idk what to tell you. I used it this morning. I transported to you screen up to make sure it didn't touch anything or get broken.\u201d They called me a scammer, hurting for money, dishonest, said they were going to call the police on me if I didn\u2019t give them their money back, that they had my license plate and was going to blast me on fb.  I feel like I did my part to make sure the tv got to them safely and I tried to help her several times and got rejected. This is my first time experiencing something like this.

        "selftext": "Let me preface with that I fully understand that many people have different viewpoints of \u201chonoring\u201d their parents, lol. So my husband and I apparently have differing views about honoring our parents, and I\u2019ve been made out to be the \u201casshole\u201d by his family multiple times. His family is not respecting of boundaries I\u2019ve put up, and he (husband) also put up, and so I\u2019ve definitely been a bit more rigid about things. My husband already ruined what I wanted for our wedding by inviting his whole extended family as his parents wanted him to (I wanted something more intimate), letting his mother take unwanted \u201cformal\u201d wedding pictures which made me uncomfortable (we\u2019d hired a photographer), and just other various things. They push and push and push and it\u2019s suffocating.  Anyways\u2014 now I\u2019ve become the asshole again because I don\u2019t want to \u201chonor\u201d his parents by letting them see me and our firstborn child within the first 24 hours of me giving birth. (I don\u2019t want my parents there, either, lol, I just want it to be the two of us.) I already know myself and my body and my emotions, and with how overbearing his parents are\u2014 I know it\u2019s going to be hell for me. He claims that the birth isn\u2019t \u201cjust about us, it\u2019s about our parents, too\u201d which I laughed in his face about (maybe that\u2019s asshole-ish, lol). My parents don\u2019t believe their first grandchild is about them, and so I\u2019m not sure where my husband and his parents get this notion. AITA for sticking my ground and refusing that?

        "selftext": "Using my alternate because I don\u2019t want this traced back to me and my spouse gets my email notifications for my main on his phone. Basically, my husband (30M) thinks I (28F) am a jerk for not saying thank you about baby-related tasks. We have a 7 month old and we both work full time\u2014a few days during the week remotely, and twice a week the LO goes to daycare. I\u2019m up every day at 6:15 am to pump, then I get the baby up and ready if he hasn\u2019t woken up already, make sure he\u2019s changed, has a bottle, has breakfast, is dressed, and is happy while husband is still asleep or just getting on his work computer. I telework with LO on Mondays and Wednesdays (DH is there both days), but I don\u2019t really get anything done, which is really frustrating because I\u2019m still training in my job and I get anxious trying to balance LO and work. Tuesdays I\u2019m out the door bringing LO to daycare by 7:30 while husband is usually still in the shower.  He usually asks me to let out the dogs because he\u2019s running late. I pump during the day to feed LO which also takes time out of my day. I make dinner every day, and I almost always feed the baby dinner too. We play on the floor while husband is on his phone on the couch, which is a little irritating because his baby is doing cute things. Then I start bath time at 7:00, and spouse will usually fill the baby tub for me. He\u2019ll also warm a bottle for me. Then I put LO to bed and we watch TV for a while. I unload and reload the dishwasher and try to start a load of bottles in the sterilizer. If LO gets up in the middle of the night, he\u2019ll warm a bottle and I\u2019ll change and feed LO and get him back to bed. I miss sleeping a bit longer on Saturdays, it\u2019d be nice if I could go back to sleep after pumping in the AM on Saturdays but husband is usually still asleep. All of this is to outline my mental load. But, every time my husband does something like unloads the dishwasher, puts dishes in the dishwasher, or does the bottles, etc., he makes a giant stink: \u201cDid you see I did the dishes? Did you see I did the bottles? Did you see I took out the trash? Are you gonna say thank you?\u201d  Like, yes of course I noticed, but these are things I do all the time and they are expected of you too? I don\u2019t care if I get a thank you? Like the other day, I cleaned your work desk because it was horribly dusty, take your dirty dishes every day, and tidy the baby\u2019s room but I didn\u2019t get a thank you. I also don\u2019t make a stink about not getting a thank you. Why is it necessary for me to thank you when I have a million other things on my mind? So I say thanks for doing that, but then he gets grumpy that my tone is hateful. I just don\u2019t have the capacity to be all gushy and grateful that he did things that are expected. AITA for not thanking him? I just think it\u2019s crazy to constantly say thank you for tasks like this.",

        "selftext": "I (26F) and my partner (27F) planned a birthday dinner for her father (FIL) at a steakhouse. A while back, I received a gift and a $200 gift card to this restaurant as a thank-you from a contractor I work closely with, which I thought would be perfect for the occasion. During Christmas, I opened the gift (with the gift card) and my SIL (31F) was there to see me holding up the gift card. She immediately suggested we use it for FIL's birthday. I agreed, but I didn\u2019t realize she\u2019d interpret \u201cwe\u201d to mean she could invite her BF (recently reconciled after a year-long breakup) and go all-out with their orders. A few days before the dinner, SIL asked if her BF could join. I was hesitant since he hadn\u2019t been around for a year, and the family has mixed feelings about him. My partner doesn\u2019t like conflict and said yes, so he came. At the dinner, things got awkward fast. SIL and her BF ordered the most expensive items on the menu. They both ordered surf and turf with extra lobster tail while the rest of us ordered modestly. Their meal alone was over $150. At the end of the meal, SIL then suggested dessert, but I declined since my partner and I already bought a cake for FIL. The bill came to be approximately $300 after tax and tip. I used the gift card but still had to pay $100 with my credit card. I asked SIL to cover her and her BF\u2019s share and split the cost of FIL\u2019s meal with me, explaining that the gift card wasn\u2019t \u201cfree money\u201d for her and her BF to splurge. She got upset, said the gift card should cover everything, and stormed out with her BF. Later, my partner and I drove my in-laws home and dropped them off in awkward silence. On the way back, my partner told me I was out of line, but I feel justified since SIL\u2019s actions caused the bill to exceed the gift card\u2019s value. AITA? Update 1: Thank you everyone for commenting and providing feedback in this thread! The comments here has help me see things in a different perspective and now will help me prevent such thing from happening again in the future. I received a call from my FIL this afternoon (the dinner was last night). He called to thank me for organizing and paying for the dinner. He also mentioned that he plans to call SIL later today to talk to her, though I\u2019m not sure how much detail he will go into. So far, I\u2019ve apologized to SIL for any miscommunication and for asking her to split at the dinner table. However, I haven\u2019t received a response from SIL, and my partner has been cold toward me. Honestly, I don't expect to get paid back, this is just a lesson for me to learn. Updates 2: This is probably my last update, and I think there\u2019s a resolution to this problem. I got a call from SIL in the evening; she apologized and Venmoed me $100, which is better than nothing. My partner and I also had a serious discussion about their family, and I feel like there\u2019s been some progress in improving the relationship between me and their family. I\u2019ve seen a lot of comments saying I have no backbone or that I\u2019m a pushover, and that\u2019s probably true to a certain degree. Their family dynamic is still new to me, and I didn\u2019t want to make a bad impression in front of my FIL and MIL, so I held back. Unfortunately, I ended up snapping at the end. I\u2019ve learned a valuable lesson to speak up for myself and not cave when things feel unfair. Quick clarification on payment: My partner and I share a joint credit card, which we use to pay for meals out. SIL has a habit of avoiding credit cards, though I\u2019ve never looked into why. Typically, when dining with my partner\u2019s family, I cover the bill with our joint card, and SIL Venmos me her portion plus 50% of my in-laws\u2019 portion. That\u2019s why I asked her to cover her share and at least split FIL\u2019s cost with me for his birthday dinner.",

        "selftext": "My (23M) cousin (30M) and his GF (32F) recently had to move out of their place after his girlfriend lost her job. My cousin has been unemployed for quite some time due to his mental health, which is a sore subject for him (this will be relevant later). His GF has been job searching, but it\u2019s a long process and they need somewhere to stay in the meantime, so they\u2019ve been staying with me and my roommate (22M).\u00a0 I didn\u2019t love this arrangement in the first place since we have a two-bedroom apartment and I\u2019ve needed to move into my roommate\u2019s room to make space, but it\u2019s family and my roommate says he doesn\u2019t mind having me in his room for now (plus my aunt is paying us) so whatever.\u00a0 The problem is that my cousin and his GF have insisted on bringing their emotional support dog with them (not a service dog). It\u2019s technically fine in terms of our lease and I don\u2019t mind dogs in general so at first I said OK, but this thing has been a nightmare. It\u2019s loud, pees on our floors, and it chewed up one of our couch pillows. My cousin and his GF think this behavior is hysterical and endearing, but every time my roommate and I tried to bring up that we\u2019d rather they find somewhere else for their dog, they go on and on about how they can\u2019t possibly part with their \u201cfur baby\u201d and just will not hear it. This all kind of culminated last night because my roommate had an important presentation this morning so he tried to go to bed early last night, but the dog would not stop barking. My cousin and his GF were all like \u201cawww she wants to play\u201d but my roommate and I were pretty annoyed. I told my cousin that this arrangement was not working and that he needed to find somewhere else to put the dog. He told me again that it\u2019s their \u201cfur baby\u201d, and his GF started getting really upset and telling me we were making the dog feel unwelcome and it was like asking them to part with their child. I told them that the dog is not a baby and that they need to take responsibility for it or find somewhere else for the three of them to stay. He reminded me that he needs the dog for emotional support and that his GF is trying to find a job and they have nowhere to go until then. Partially out of anger, I told him that his emotional support needs weren\u2019t my problem and that maybe he should try getting a job too. I know he\u2019s had a rough time with his mental health and how that impacts employment so I think those two statements put together cut a little deeper than I intended, and he hasn\u2019t been talking to me today and his girlfriend called me an ableist for what I said. My aunt texted me this morning that my cousin and his GF plan on moving out this weekend with their dog and that I was way too harsh with him. I do understand why the comment had that effect on them and I feel bad for that, but it finally got the dog out of our place after we\u2019ve been trying the gentler approach so I don\u2019t really know what else I could\u2019ve done.

        "selftext": "AITA? My (27m) husband and I (26f) have been living together for about 3 years. We have always had a basket in the bathroom for dirty laundry. The entire time we\u2019ve been living together I\u2019m the one who has always done laundry. When the basket gets full I take it to the laundry room and wash everything that\u2019s in it. For the past several months my husband has started leaving his dirty clothes mostly in a pile in the floor in the bedroom instead of putting them in the basket. We\u2019ve had conversations about this several times and he says he\u2019ll make sure to start putting his clothes in the basket, but nothing has really changed. This morning he made a comment about how he has to go to work in dirty clothes. Including dirty socks and underwear. I didn\u2019t say anything because I\u2019ve washed the clothes in the basket and was caught up on laundry. Then he asks me if I could wash his clothes for him so he doesn\u2019t have to go to work in dirty clothes. I told him that I\u2019ll wash his clothes when he puts them in the basket. He got mad and said I was petty for not washing his laundry and that he doesn\u2019t understand why I can\u2019t take 30 more seconds to pick up all his clothes off the floor and wash them. I told him that if it was so easy then why couldn\u2019t he take 30 seconds to pick them up and do it and that I wasn\u2019t his mom and I\u2019m not picking up his dirty clothes off the floor when there\u2019s a basket. According to him I\u2019m a petty asshole and don\u2019t do anything for him because I refuse to pick up his clothes from the floor to wash them. Am I the asshole for not picking up his clothes?",

        "selftext": "I\u2019m 19F in college living with four other roommates and we all pretty much eat microwave food that goes in our freezer. We have a very small freezer and for the first half of the year it wasn\u2019t that bad to fit stuff in it because our fourth roommate wasn\u2019t really using it and we all shopped lightly. Recently I\u2019ve noticed that our freezer is literally packed to the point that it won\u2019t close. I\u2019ve noticed that it\u2019s food that they all keep in there for weeks without eating. I have exactly one thing in there and it barely takes up any room. For perspective, said roommate just went out and bought food for the next two weeks and took up so much space. I texted the groupchat and asked them to reorganize and consider other peoples space when shopping for groceries, or for them to eat them within the next week. My roommate said \u201cI\u2019ll eat half of my stuff in the next week\u201d and then brushed off my request and just said that it\u2019ll be hard to fit stuff no matter what because it\u2019s a small space for four people. That felt very dismissive and like she\u2019s refusing to come up with a solution that\u2019s fair for everyone. So I texted back and asked if she would shop for groceries for the next week instead of two weeks from now on. She sent back a pretty angry-sounding text saying that she shops when she wants to and doesn\u2019t feel like going to the store every week.  I have no idea what to do! I really want space for the freezer. Talked to my pops about this and he said \u201ceither you buy fresh food or put your foot down with then because they\u2019re being selfish.\u201d I\u2019m going to try to buy fresh food to put elsewhere but it\u2019s hard for me to eat them before they expire so quickly. Being a college student I really just want quick easy meals. Did I push it too far? AITA?",

        "selftext": "I 19F was adopted at birth. I don\u2019t know this until I was 17. I found out in the worst way possible. My grandpa was drunk and told me. I asked my parents and they confessed. They called me ungrateful for asking. After finding out I was adopted a lot of things suddenly made sense. My parents family often excluded me from things like family pictures and reunions. My mom would fight it (sometimes) but it wouldn\u2019t help. It felt like I never fit in. When I turned 18 I moved in with my roommate. She said it might be cool to find out who my biological parents are. I asked my parents and once again I get called ungrateful. I didn\u2019t know were to look from there. My roomie suggested one of those ancestry DNA tests to find a match. We did that and boom, I got into contact with my biological uncle via email and soon after that, phone. After that he told my biological mother about the situation. She freaked out. We met and it was an amazing experience. I love her and I want to make a point that this does not take away from the love I have for my adoptive parents. I just hate how they covered it up. I got to meet the rest of my bio family as well. Since my parents treated me as ungrateful for asking questions about my biological family I didn\u2019t tell them.  I did, however, recognize that I would need to tell them eventually. I knew they would be angry but it had to happen. I visit them every so often. Keeping this secret from them was starting to make me feel guilty so I decided to tell them yesterday. I texted my mom asking if I could come over for dinner. She said yes and I had a conversation with them with all my siblings present. This made me uncomfortable but if my parents found out, they would find out as well. It all started well. My dad stated how she was happy to see me come over to eat with them. Well, a few minutes later I told them. Their initial reaction was one of shock. My mom asked my siblings to go to their room so she and my father could talk to me alone. To my surprise, they weren\u2019t angry. They asked my why I did it. I told them the truth. Curiosity got the best of me. I thought my blood was theirs for 17 years and when I found out it wasn\u2019t, I had to find out where it comes from. They asked in what way could I forget everything they did for me and that family is more than blood connections. I told them I didn\u2019t forget. I was just angry at them for hiding the fact from me. My biological parents gave me up because they were poor and lived in a rural area with little opportunity for them. That actually made me more grateful for my parents.   My mom got really offended by this. How I could feel anger towards her was incomprehensible for her and my father. I told them it\u2019s best I should leave. My mom told not to come back until I learned some gratitude and learned to appreciate family. I\u2019m sorry for any typing mistakes I made. I\u2019m typing this at night and this is a stressful situation. AITA?",

        "selftext": "My partner and I have been together for three years. During this time I have helped him on remodeling some of his rental properties and other property management tasks. He helped me repair my home after a major flood incident. I would say up until this point, our work for work exchange has been fairly equal to slightly tipping the scale in his favor. He recently decided to completely gut and remodel one of the rental homes. This project is expected to take 6 months or more. We anticipate remodeling several of the properties over the next few years. This is going to be a significant time and labor investment. We have talked about marriage and what a prenup might look like. He has been clear in that he wants to keep his rental properties as separate property if we were to get married. He has even gone as far to say that he would want the rental properties even separate from me in his estate planning/will and that everything would go to his sibilings. This has been alarming to me and quite hurtful. I understand he doesnt want to lose assets in the event we divorced but I truly don't understand the estate side of things. This detail makes a difference because we have a 13 year age gap and he would likely pass before me.  I have told him that if he wants to keep the rental business separate, that's fine... but I will no longer be volunteering my time to his business. Basically that I won't be his free labor slave girl to enrich him and his family. If he wants me to come work on remodeling the properties he will need to pay me as if I am an employee. I told him my pay rate would be $20 an hour. I have also suggested he call on his family to come help him. I am firm on this boundary right now. He is becoming resentful of my position on this. He believes that me helping him benefits both of us. I have asked him how it benefits both of us and he really can't quantify how it benefits me in any way. We have totally separate finances. I am on board to be a partner and teammate but what he expects doesn't really look like a partnership to me.  So, AITA for not agreeing to work on his rental property business for free? ",

The carpool also includes Jenny (13F) (all fake names) who Maya used to be friends with, but the friendship ended after an argument over a group outfit.  Since that happened, Maya is saying that she wants Jenny out of the carpool. Her explanation was that being around her ex-friend is giving her anxiety since she knows Jenny doesn\u2019t like her anymore. I asked has Jenny been saying or doing anything to you? Maya said no, but she shouldn\u2019t have to sit next to someone who doesn\u2019t like her everyday. I need to back her up and stop driving Jenny in the carpool because I\u2019m her sister and not Jenny\u2019s  I explained that Jenny\u2019s mom obviously won\u2019t participate in the carpool if Jenny isn\u2019t allowed, which means Maya and Joey won\u2019t have an affordable way to school on Mondays and Fridays anymore. I also told Maya that she can listen to her music or talk to our brother on the ride as a distraction.  Maya kept arguing though and I was out of patience. So I told Maya that the fact is that not everybody\u2019s gonna like you and broken friendships are going to happen in life. She needs to get over it and I better not hear about her trying to start any issues with Jenny or her mom over this.  I\u2019m conflicted because of my parents. Dad feels bad because broken friendships at that age are still painful, and he said I was mean for not offering to work out something. But Mom is out of patience as well because they\u2019re already seated at opposite windows and Jenny isn\u2019t saying or doing anything. She said she approved of what I told Maya because she\u2019s not going to mess up the carpool and let them pay a ridiculous fee every semester just because she\u2019s uncomfortable. Is Dad still right that AITA and should have tried to work something out with Maya?",

        "selftext": "Apologies.. I want to include as many details as i can but I'm also staying vague for anonymity sake. My husband (36m) and his sister (38f) were born and raised in Africa. They immigrated to America as older teens/young adults, so they have no experience growing up in the U.S. Recently, my SIL was upset because her son (10m) has recently started asking to go by an American/English name. His name is a very traditional name from her and my husband's culture and it has no standard counterpart in English. Apparently my nephew has been teased for his weird name and just wants a normal name to fit in. She asked me what I thought because I grew up in the US with a foreign name.  I (35f) was born and raised in the U.S. to immigrant parents from an European country. My name is from their country/native language, but it has an English counterpart (think like Erzs\u00e9bet - Elizabeth) so I tended to use the American version in school so my classmates and teachers could pronounce it.  I told my SIL to let my nephew use the new American name/nickname so he wouldn't be teased. She got upset because his name has a lot of meaning and she doesn't want him to be ashamed of his background and culture. She said I wouldn't understand because my name came from a white country and we live in a fairly white area so people are more accepting of it. I just think that why he should be proud of his name and culture, kids suck and sometimes it's just better to go along to get along. That she let him use new name to not be teased and wait until he is more mature to understand why he should love his name. AITA for telling her that? EDIT (31 Jan): I don't know if people care or not but I have a small update I have to share because I am just so proud of my nephew!! He sat his mom down and showed her a list of names that he liked.  He showed her what they all meant and how the meanings related to his actual name, so that he would still honor his name's meaning. Isn't he just so smart?? My SIL was still against the idea lol, but she has warmed up to the idea of him going by his initials. Apparently a new friend of his sometimes refers to him by initials already.  I doubt there'll be anything worth updating after this. I wish we could have had a warm hallmark moment where my nephew teaches his bullies about his culture and everyone hugs it out at the end but alas, life is more complicated. This all has generated a lot of conversations between my husband and I, as well, since I recently found out I was pregnant, about raising mixed race/culture children in today's world.  Thank you to everyone who was kind enough to respond.  ",

This betrayal was a blow to me, because we had built a whole future together, even without children, something that as I was sterile I could never provide her, something that had never been a problem for us until she made a point of throwing it in my face when I caught them in the act to justify herself. My whole family knew about it and stood by me in the separation except my niece who was always very attached to both of us and especially to her, and said that I should forgive her,and although it hurt me to dislike I couldn't go on with the marriage. After the separation I was able to gradually rebuild my life and even found a new girlfriend who I will call jane (32) who has two adorable children, John (14) and Anne (6) and I love them as if they were mine. Four months ago I received the invitation to my niece's wedding and promptly accepted, Until she told me that she hoped that my ex-wife and I would be her best men at the wedding, I was shocked and I made a point of firmly saying that I could not accept the invitation and that if she was a bridesmaid I would not go to the wedding and much less enter together.

At first it was kinda cool bc she would make these fancy meals and sometimes offer me some but now she\u2019s like doing it ALL THE TIME and it\u2019s driving me nuts. She cooks literally every day, sometimes twice a day, and it\u2019s never simple stuff. It\u2019s always these big fancy recipes that use like every pot and pan we own. The kitchen is always a disaster and she doesn\u2019t even clean up after herself right away.

Also, she\u2019s started making weird stuff like fish stock and some kind of fermented stuff and it makes the WHOLE apartment stink. The fridge is also a huge issue. She\u2019s completely taken over all the space with her leftovers and jars of sauces and random ingredients. I can barely fit my milk and eggs in there.

        "selftext": "Hi everyone, I just got into a huge fight with my wife regarding attendance of conflicting events. Her best friend is getting married later this year (east coast), and has told us the dates for about two months now, and we were definitely planning on going (apart from the fact that my wife is the maid of honor). This is a smaller wedding of around 60 people so only people who her friend REALLY wanted to attend got an invite. A few days ago, I was told by my family that we were going to have our grandma's 100 year birthday party on the same day in the west coast. I thought this was a no brainer and I said if this was any other birthday, I would skip it, but this is to celebrate her 100th, and I would like to attend the big party and she can go to her friend's wedding. Literally the whole family would be there (except her - and my family understands she had a prior obligation) , and many families are travelling from overseas to be in attendance. My wife is very upset that I had rsvp'ed earlier and that now I'm backing out of attending the wedding. I can't really see what the big point is, since we can each attend the event we find more important to our individual lives. Her main points are * There are so many people attending the party, they won't even know you aren't there* You committed to wedding earlier than this event (tbh i didnt even know the party until a few days ago)* The fact that I was invited to the small wedding means so much to her friend and would make her sad if I didn't go and were not part of the pictures (I was part of the must attend list)* Parents told me to attend if you can which gives me a pass for not going and not hurting anyone's feeling* We are a unit so we should be seen together at these big events so it's gonna be weird that I'm alone at my thing and she's alone at her thing My main points are: * I like your friend but I'd prefer to celebrate 100th birthday with which is a milestone for not only my grandma but also for my family* I don't like my wife thinking for her friend* I want to attend the family event (i feel like this trumps everything all her points) IDK - I feel like it's a no brainer but she absolutely lost her shit over this and I don't feel like I did anything wrong so i can't even force myself to like try to console her (maybe I'm the asshole for this). Anyways AITA? ---------- wow so many comments - CLARIFICATIONS / FAQ  - 1. I have not said yes to the party - this discussion is still ongoing but I want to go to the party2. When my folks told me about the party I did say let me get back to you but honestly I completely forgot about the existence of the wedding when I waltzed in and dropped the bomb on my SO3. I live in east coast but extended fam lives in west coast4. Rescheduling the party is not an option. Elders have a set date near the actual birth date and a LOT of people are involved.5. Why didn't you know it was her bday when you RSVP'ed. I agree I should have known and I wish I had remembered but we were discussing the invite wife was excited / stressed about all of the MOH things she had to plan and do and I RSVP'ed without thinking harder6. She did apologize about the grandma remembering stuff and said it was out of anger - she is a sweet person so I'm going to remove it ----------- UPDATE: Thanks so much for all of the comments and perspectives - I see where I was the AH to my wife and not be aware or considerate about the amount of stress of being MOH entails. Her job was to ensure that her best friend's day is the best that it can be, and also she was expecting me to be there so it was just the perfect stress storm. For the reconciliation process - I just laid out what I would like to do which is a different than my usual approach (I like to give wife options and she can choose. She has to choose enough already so it was an attempt on my end to lesson her burdens) 1. Facetime the bride immediately after the conversation and explain the situation and timeline of events.2. Go on a double date to a restaurant that they had on their list for a while3. Go with my wife on the morning of the wedding when they start to do all the prep and congratulate her on her wedding, and then take a flight to the west coast. I'll be a little late to the birthday but it's ok. Wife was still not too happy that I was going to no be at the actual wedding, but understood that things come up and agreed with my plan. She was upset that I didnt remember that it was my grandma's birthday month and there could have been a potential celebration.",

I didn't know how to get into it, so my friend suggested her putting me up on a blind date (haha) and I agreed.She gave me his (m26) name, and we agreed when and where to meet.It was a nice and warm day, although a little snowy, so I decided to get there a little early incase it would be hard to navigate myself.I found the restaurant (I've been there before) and sat down at the booked table. The guy shows up and we start chatting. I pick up a slight accent, and ask where he is from.Now here is where I might be the AH due to my phrasing.He laughs and tells me he's localAnd I giggle and push it a little more saying haha no I can tell you're not from here.The guy stops laughing, silently gets up and leaves.Im confused, and sit there for a few minutes waiting, incase I misunderstood the situation and he went to the watercloset or something, but he doesn't come back, so I pay for the drinks and cancel the food, before getting up and walking out.  I call the friend who set us up once I'm home, and she tells me he thought you acted like such an asshole. I was apparently rude as fxxk, racist and was looking at anything but him during the conversation. I am so confused  The last part I can understand, as me being blind makes it hard to understand what om looking at, but the rest leaves me super confused.  Here's where I could be the AH. My friend also explained to me in our call that he is from the same country as me (although from the part where they also speak another language) but he is darkskinned and adopted from birth. Have I accidentally said something racist?  AITA?  Tl;Dr, I was called a racist and I do not understand why ",

        "selftext": "Some background: I (29F) used to know Tom (30M) years ago. We were acquaintances as teenagers, and though we briefly dated at 16, it wasn\u2019t serious, and we stayed on neutral terms whenever we ran into each other. A few years later, when we were in our early twenties, I bumped into him at a nightclub, and he introduced me to his then-girlfriend, Alex. From the moment we met, Alex was noticeably cold toward me she barely spoke, made passive-aggressive comments about my appearance, and created an uncomfortable tension. Sensing the awkwardness, I made my exit. Tom later messaged me to apologize for how she acted, but I brushed it off. I didn\u2019t think much of it, as we weren\u2019t close anyway. Since then, I\u2019ve occasionally run into them at different social events, and Alex\u2019s attitude toward me has never changed. She has made snide remarks in passing, whispered about me to others while I was nearby, and has generally gone out of her way to be hostile anytime we\u2019re in the same space. I\u2019ve always ignored it because, as far as I was concerned, whatever problem she had with me wasn\u2019t my issue. Now to last weekend, I was out with some friends when I saw Alex and Tom at the same venue. Tom came over to say hello and make small talk, and almost immediately, Alex stormed over. Without even greeting me, she shoved her ring in my face and made a pointed comment about how I \u201cdefinitely couldn\u2019t have him now.\u201d I laughed and told her I never wanted him in the first place, but I was happy for them. That only made things worse. She started raising her voice, accusing me of trying to get attention for years, making assumptions about me, and throwing out personal insults. When she finally finished, I asked if she was done and told her that I had never done any of the things she was accusing me of. I also made it clear that I didn\u2019t care about her or Tom and, most importantly, that she needed to stop making her personal insecurities my problem. She looked like she was about to respond, so I added that she also needed to stop being jealous of me because there was no reason for it. At that point, she excused herself and left the room, with Tom following after her. Before he left, he told me I didn\u2019t need to say all that. My friends thought my response was blunt but justified, while some mutuals later told me I was too harsh and should have been more understanding because she\u2019s obviously insecure. Now, I\u2019m wondering was I too harsh?",

        "selftext": "I (23F) and my ex (22M) have been broken up for just about 3 years now.  (For context now, we had a child together in our relationship and we are both currently in new relationships. His new girlfriend is pregnant with his second child.) Recently I received a message from my ex asking for a stone carved pregnant elephant that was gifted to me by his great grandmother 5 years back. His grandmother sadly passed a year back and he is currently asking for it back. I asked him firstly why he wanted it back as it was a gift for me during my pregnancy. A bit more context, we visited his family and his grandmother had elephants everywhere in her home. I made a comment about how beautiful her collection was, as some of them were very unique. She lit up and insisted I take one as a \u201cwelcome to the family\u201d present. I tried to politely tell her I would feel horrible to break up her collection but she kept insisting. At this point I didn\u2019t want to be rude and said okay and walked around with her as she told me stories of how she got some of the elephants. Anyways, we stumble upon the stone carved elephant with a carved out tummy with a baby inside. She heavily implied that my choice should be that specific elephant as it fits the situation perfectly (me being pregnant and all at the time.) I smile and accepted and thanked her for letting me carry apart of her collection with me. She gave me a hug and accepted me into part of the family. My ex (who I guess got a bit jealous) wanted to pick out an elephant of his own, so he got to do so. Back to current day. He told me, due to the passing of his grandmother, he wanted to have the elephant to put with a gift he got with his great grandfather so that they could both be together. When I asked him why he specifically wanted mine, he kept dodging the question and said it belonged to his grandmother and it being a gift from her to me held no value. I reminded him that he got to choose his own that day, he dodged that too. Calling me selfish and a lowlife. Part of me is more than willing to give it back to him but part of me knows that he is going to gift this elephant to his new girlfriend because of her new pregnancy. (I say this because I know his narcissistic and manipulative personality.) Why would he ask me NOW and not a year ago upon her passing?  AITA? UPDATE: I looked at the price of the elephant online, it\u2019s made from jade and have seen some sold for 200-400$ online. Money might be his key factor in getting it back",

        "selftext": "My friend and I were hanging out at my place for almost the entire day yesterday. I told her about this amazing ice cream place at the mall and I'd treat her. At first she agreed and told me it's a great idea. Then she suddenly snapped and said that she can't eat ice cream because she's on this healthy diet, and she absolutely will not touch that stuff and it's wrong. I told her that she's not forced to eat it, that it was just a suggestion. It just so happened that my work place (it's at the mall) needed my assistance and asked if I could come in for a few minutes to help them. (I live like 5-10 mins away from the mall so it's no problem). I told her we any ways have to go because my coworkers need help.  I told her we can hang at the mall for a bit if she's down. Any ways we were passing the ice cream place and I told her I'm grabbing some for my self and I asked her if she's sure that she does not want any. She said she's good and thanked me for offering. We're browsing the mall and she tells me the ice cream actually looks really good if she could have a lick. I told her if she really wants it I'll get it for her no problem. But she said she just wants to try it from mine. I told her I'm not comfortable with that but the offer still stands about me getting her an ice cream. She got annoyed and said Why are you being such an AH about this I don't want a whole damn ice cream I just want a lick from yours. I told her again I'm not comfortable with that. I'm just very weird when it comes to sharing food where spit could easily be exchanged, unless I'm very close with the person and I'm at a certain level of trust with them for example my mom or my brother. Like I could be good friends with some one but still not be comfortable sharing those types of food with them. My friend and I are just good friends from college that is all. So AITA? I mean I still offered to buy her an ice cream as an alternative.",

        "selftext": "When my husband and I got married, his parents (divorced but still best friends) bought us a house as a wedding gift. I think it\u2019s relevant to say that my husband and I have been together since we were in highschool and his parents are good friends of my family. My FIL has been remarried since my DH (Lee) was in middle school, and his new wife, let\u2019s call her Patty, brought along a daughter Lee\u2019s age into the marriage. I\u2019ll call SIL Eli for simplicity\u2019s sake.  Eli has always had a involved dad and doesn\u2019t have a father daughter relationship with FIL. Her dad is well to do, but has five other kids so he\u2019s not able to be as generous as my FIL is with Lee who\u2019s an only child. Eli\u2019s getting married in a month and she came over out of the blue yesterday to rant because she \u201cfound out\u201d that FIL isn\u2019t getting her and her fianc\u00e9e Dora a house for their wedding present. Lee and I listened to her and Dora\u2019s rant, but Lee got upset and had to excuse himself after Dora started mentioning that FIL might be homophobic. I told them plainly that they were being ungrateful because FIL is covering their two month long honeymoon expenses and paying for a portion of their wedding- he only did the latter for Lee and I. I also added that FIL and MIL paid for the house TOGETHER, so it wasn\u2019t all him. And that Patty didn\u2019t help whatsoever despite being Lee\u2019s stepmom, but that\u2019s not relevant I guess? Dora and Eli both got mad at me and said I was defending a bigot, and stormed out, and since then I\u2019ve been \u201casked\u201d not to come to the wedding. Patty sided with Eli and is now not on good terms with my FIL, who\u2019s upset and feels like his contributions aren\u2019t being appreciated. So AITA for telling my SIL that she\u2019s not owed a house? Edit: forgot to add. Eli and Dora\u2019s only been together for a year and a half. They decided to get engaged spontaneously at Patty\u2019s thanksgiving dinner. FIL disapproves of Dorothea\u2019s profession (she\u2019s a stripper), but has never outwardly shown it I wasn\u2019t sure if it was relevant to bring up their past but based on a few comments i think it is. Eli and Dora\u2019s relationship started when they met at Dora\u2019s job. The one year and a half has been a sugar mommy/baby dynamic but Eli\u2019s expressed it\u2019s \u2018serious\u2019.  FIL and I are close and he privately told Lee and I that he doesn\u2019t think they\u2019re in it for the long run",

        "selftext": "This isn't on my main acc as I want genuine opinions I (34 F ) and husband (37 M) and stepmom (52 F) My stepmom has been helping us out by babysitting my 2 children (2 and 5) and while me and my husband are very grateful, we are very upset with her. My stepmom recently was divorced by my father. My stepmom had no where to go so she had asked to stay with us. I hadn't had a great relationship with her for stealing stuff I had bought with my money when I was 17 however I decided to push past this and move on. When she moved in, we went over rules and told her what her experience would look like. She agreed to our rules, which included buying food for herself when necessary, although we did tell her we would mostly be buying stuff for her so she could get back on her feet.  Another rule we had was babysitting. We would agree to pay her for babysitting our kids when we needed her so that she could make some money to get back on her feet. We gave her our job contact info had she ever needed to call them if she couldn't get ahold of us while we were at work. Recently, we haven't really been needing her to babysit but she has been insistent on paying for food items. We went over the fact that this wasn't needed and she replied that she wanted to feel like she had more power over us by paying for food. I gently reminded her that this was our house and she was a guest in it to which she got pissed. She told me and my husband that she has power over us and how she was my mom. I didn't reply and just stopped talking to her. My husband had made plans with her that we would need her to babysit our kids this past Monday and she had agreed to it since we were both going to work. I am at work when my work receives a call from my husband telling me that my stepmom called him saying that she was leaving to go party with her friends, and he was going back home to talk to her. I agree that he is doing the reasonable thing since she has no concept of responsibility.  I then, while at work receive a call from my stepmom who had said that my husband said that she needed to grow up and gain responsibility or get out. I, of course sided with my husband and she hung up. The next morning, whilst driving home I noticed my stepmoms car wasn't in my driveway and I asked my husband about it, to which he replied she chose to get out. I have been trying to reach my stepmom for days but she nor my step-sister (whom she moved in with) will hold a conversation with me and my stepmom will not apologize. I'm starting to feel like the AH since neither of them will respond to me. Did I overreact and overstep for basically kicking her out? EDIT 1: I disliked her when I was 17, didn't really talk to her and then decided to give her another chance based on step sis who had a problem similar to mine which stepmom was able to apologize and grow from. The original reason she moved in with me and not step sis is because she is having a rough time paying the rent, also we would pay stepmom and she wouldn't.",

        "selftext": "This is my first time posting so sorry for any mistakes. My husband Jack (33M) and I (28F) have a toddler together and have another one on the way. He's a stay at home and I work full time. I'm out of the house the majorty of the day while he's home with the toddler.  Jack doesn't do anything. He never sets an alarm to get up with the toddler. I do. He sits in the living room until our toddler's nap (which varies every day) then goes to the basement to play his video games. Our toddler will sleep anywhere from 2 to 3 hours. Then once our toddler wakes up, he gets her, makes dinner, and maybe gets one chore done around the house. Almost every day he does this. There are some days when I'm pleasantly surprised.  I've talked to Jack multiple times about keeping the house cleaned, but he claims it's not fair that I don't have to do anything (which isn't true). If the house is kept up on, I do dishes, laundry, and meal prep on my days off. Sometimes I'll bake too. I'll also be on toddler duty. However once he lets the house go, I don't do anything other than clean the areas my toddler is in so she's not affected by it because she deserves a clean house.  I have (almost) gotten the house completely cleaned 3 times now, and he lets the house go. I've tried splitting chores, but again, it's hard when I work full time and I'm out of the house the majorty of the day. My job has me on my feet all day and some days are harder than others. I tell Jack all the time (and have proven it sometimes) that if the roles were reversed, I'd have the house cleaned for him. Jack claims that's not true. He claims it's my fault that the house is trashed because I should do more, yet I work full time because he didn't want to work, which I supported and made more sense financially. I have also been really tired and just want to sleep due to my pregnancy, but Jack gets mad if I don't wake up in the morning, even though I let him sleep in most mornings. I know how Reddit can be, which is why I didn't want to post, but I'm at my wits end. We literally had another fight about the house being trashed and instead of helping me clean like I asked, he's now working in the garage. (Jack will literally find other things to do other than clean the house. For example, if there's a task that needs to be done, he'll take all day to do it, even if it's an hour long job). So AITA for expecting my husband to clean the house? Should I be doing more?",

        "selftext": "I (f29) have always had a pretty close relationship with my mom. We lived about an hour from each other which I know isn\u2019t far, but we both had our own homes and lives. I always called her for everything, she used to ask me to go out and have like dinner or go see a movie etc.. we were pretty close up until this.. Growing up, my mom made a lot of mistakes. DON\u2019T think I\u2019m not grateful for my mom, I am.. but she had a terrible gambling addiction, owed REAL bad people money, moved close to 10 times between the ages of 7 to about the time I was 18 due to evictions or mortgage foreclosures.. and has been into hard drugs in and out throughout my life.  May of 2023, I call my mom and ask her about what we should do for Mother\u2019s Day and/or her birthday (her birthday is a week after Mother\u2019s Day, and we normally just celebrate one or the other). Knowing she worked her birthday, I had asked her if she would like to do something on Mother\u2019s Day instead since I work later swing shift, and could do something before i work. She proceeds to tell me she has the day off, and I was shocked. I ask her how, and she goes \u201cI quit I don\u2019t work there anymore\u201d obviously I was confused asf and asked for more, and she gave me a bullshit story. Later in the next few months, I find out that she actually got fired, for doing drugs in the parking lot at her job.  I\u2019ve tried throughout the rest of this time (until recently) to get her to talk to me about this or get her help with like a rehab or anything like that. She\u2019s never been interested in getting help. She hadn\u2019t worked since May of 2023 now. All she does is stay at home, do drugs, and call me at 3am with random shit that she\u2019s hyped up about and tell me all the projects she\u2019s doing and stuff about her dogs. It breaks my heart that she\u2019s still trying to update me in her life and what she\u2019s doing but I can\u2019t stand to talk to her now\u2026  As of a week ago, I found out that my mom is now so far behind on her mortgage.. that it\u2019s going into foreclosure. Her and her also drug addict husband (at least he has a good paying job) are trying to scrounge up the money to buy their home back from the bank. He makes a good amount of money, but clearly they haven\u2019t been spending their money on the damn mortgage. They owe 178k still on the mortgage, and need to get 6k to cover the late payments and whatever and then they need to  apply for the loan.  My mom calls me and asked me if I could borrow her the money. I told her how could I trust that that money would be going to the mortgage and not her drug addiction. She tells me \u201cidk what you\u2019re talking about\u201d like she always has said throughout my life. I tell her no, I won\u2019t give her the money. She cries to me, begging me to give her the money or she\u2019s going to lose her home.. I tell her to get a job, and I hung up the phone. I start to explode with tears because I\u2019m so heart broken and sad for her and I feel terrible for not giving her the money but\u2026 I just don\u2019t know what to do. AITA? ",

        "selftext": "I 16f live with my older sister 21f and both my parents. My sister is currently pregnant with twins and is due in April. Before my sister got pregnant we switched rooms which was a HUGE mistake on my part because I had to spend 4 hours cleaning HER room after we switched. Even though she told me to clean mine because she was \u201cgoing to clean hers\u201d. Now I should\u2019ve known better because I know her but you have to understand I am not being dramatic with 2 people it took my friend and I a little bit over 4 hours to get it livable for my standards. I had to shampoo the carpet 3 times for it to smell decent. Sorry I just need to get it across for this story to make sense.       Now the room I\u2019m in now had a bathroom that was previously broken because you\u2019ll never guess, my sister broke it! About 3 months ago we got it fixed. And 3 months ago now suddenly she\u2019s not going to be able to raise her babies upstairs because there\u2019s not enough room. Now my room is a little bigger than hers, but not by much. I have a smaller bed than she does so she would take up more space in this room than I would so that could also be why she feels her space is not big enough.       Now here\u2019s my issue her carpet upstairs is stained BAD the carpet is mostly fucking hard and it reeks of mold not to mention IM going to have to clean it. I\u2019m sorry but why should I be punished? I\u2019m not pregnant? I didn\u2019t do anything to deserve this? I know my parents won\u2019t clean it, or ask her to. Why should I have to clean up her mess AGAIN for a room I don\u2019t even want. There is stains all over the walls, and trash stashed in every corner because it\u2019s \u201cclean\u201d. Now I understand that after she gives birth it most definitely will affect her ability to walk upstairs where her room is, which is her new reason for us needing to switch rooms but not even two months ago she was sleeping in the living room because she couldn\u2019t walk upstairs which was weird because she switched back to her room upstairs?? I\u2019m not going to say anything because you know I\u2019m 16 I\u2019ve never been fucking pregnant before but that was just a little odd to me. But I really like my room I\u2019ve put in a lot of money time and effort into it and I don\u2019t really want to have to do it again, my mom tells me that she won\u2019t make us switch but I\u2019m worried my sister will guilt trip her into doing what she wants like always,but where I might\u2019ve been the asshole is when she asked me for the 2nd time she said I had already agreed to switch rooms which was not true. So, I got angry and told her I never agreed to that to stop making shit up and she\u2019d have to kill me to get this room from me. Which caused her to get angry and we started arguing so am I the asshole for refusing to switch rooms? ",

My inheritance is much less than my sister's but I don't complain as I'm happy we have somewhere to live. My sister asked to have a party at my house as I live in a large house and she has a flat. The condition was she has to clean afterwards and her husband won't cook they will order food. They have completely trashed our house, made food and left it. Used my expensive dishes and cast iron and left it dirty. Drank about \u00a350 worth of alcohol. I'm pregnant and literally due in one week and my house is fked. I asked them to pay for a cleaner. According to my family I'm the bad guy wtf. My mum says I should have specified to them not to drink our alcohol?!?! I'm actually shocked. Apparently because I Inherited the house that I should just deal with it.  Just at a loss that I'm the bad guy and I shouldn't ask for the money back for the alcohol. What do you all think?  UPDATE: My mum now sides with me and cleaned up all the mess which I'm very surprised about, she is also angry with them because they asked her to pick up \u00a340 in decorations and now they don't want to pay for it.

Luke is a foster kid and my son has been best friends with him since they were 6. Reed is actually my ex's biological nephew but we adopted him when he was 3.  We told the boys that they had a special surprise that they would get before school. Luke's parents dropped him off with his bag at my house and Randy picked both kids up. I told my son's teacher he'd be missing school and she thanked me because the less kids on a Friday before a holiday, the better. My ex called me up and asked why Reed wasn't at school. I said because he's at Disneyland with Uncle Randy and Luke. She said I should had asked her beforehand. I said, should had asked or told you. She said asked. I said his trip is on my custody time (one week on,one week off) so, no, I don't have to ask you permission. I don't ask you to ask me for permission when Reed goes on a sleepover. Plus Luke has never been to Disneyland and neither kid has stayed at $1,500 a night suite. I said maybe I should had told you, although we generally don't tell each about sleepovers but I'm not apologizing for not asking for your permission. I tried to understand her logic. She said she wasn't comfortable with non-relative adult taking Reed on a vacation. I said Randy is his uncle. She said you know what I mean. He really isn't. I said I wasn't going to continue this conversation with her and she can kiss my ass. Randy was family enough to accept money from him. The irony is that I've raised that kid more than her because I'm a remote worker who can do most of my job on my phone so Reed is growing up with a SAHD.",

        "selftext": "I (26F) lost my mother to cancer when I was 8 and have always had an absent father. I only found out who he was when I was 13 and even then he did not want custody of me forcing me to stay in the foster system until I was 18. Over my whole life I have had about 5 conversations with him give or take- he is like a stranger to me. He appears once in a blue moon to ask for money or something along those lines. It doesn't really bother me anymore, I've just learnt to accept it now but i don't like talking about it so to avoid that conversation with people i usually just say both my parents are dead. This leads me to a year and a half ago when I had just started dating my boyfriend (25M) and like usual I had just told him my parents were dead but the other day my dad showed up at my door (I still don't know how he knows where I live) and asked for 100 dollars except my boyfriend was there and he obviously found out my dad was not dead. This lead to a long conversation with him that night where I explained the whole situation. He said this was a breach of trust between us since I lied about my dad and that he needed some space to rethink our relationship but he doesn't think he will leave me. I feel so shitty and that I should have told him earlier but I am going to be honest I just didn't think. So AITA? UPDATE: my boyfriend texted me 5 mins ago asking to talk so we are going to have a full in depth conversation tomorrow after work and I'll update again then :)   UPDATE 2 (last update): Before I get to the update I would like clear things up. 1. I have only given money to my dad once when I was still desperate for his love and acceptance but he did not get any money this time. 2. Despite his confusion my bf stepped in to defend me and get my dad to leave and it was only after my dad left he asked me about it Now onto the update. My boyfriend told me that all the sudden information along with the knowledge I hadn't told him the truth was very overwhelming and he just needed some space to not say the wrong thing. He also said that he got why I lied initially and he wasn't mad that I lied more hurt that I felt like I couldn't tell him about it. He also mentioned that he couldn't be there for me if he didn't know what was going on. The conversation ended in tears and it is the most vulnerable I have been in front of someone. He was very understanding and we have decided to draw a line in the sand and 'start again' if that makes sense. I have also looked into therapy for my childhood trauma and all in all I am using this as an opportunity to better myself and heal fully. Thank you for all your kind comments :)",

        "selftext": "Throwaway for anonymity Ok, so the hot-dog eating contest happened like 6 months ago during the summer, and I had no idea that I did anything wrong, but my gf and I were arguing about something else and she brought the contest up and said I had acted childishly, and I wanted to know if there was anything that I had to apologize for. So, basically, six months ago my gf invited me to a food festival in her hometown. The day I arrived, I learned that there was a hot-dog eating contest and the prize would be an $100 gift card to a large tech retail store. Being a casual competitive eater in college, I decided it would be a fun idea to enter and signed up on the website. When I told my gf\u2019s family I had entered the contest, my gf\u2019s dad good-naturedly clapped me on the back, and said \u201clet the best man win.\u201d Apparently, my gf\u2019s dad had won the hot-dog eating contest for the last 4 years, and was somewhat expecting to win again. Wanting the gift card, I decided to give the contest my all. I ate a bunch of hot dogs, I wasn\u2019t even paying attention to what I was doing, but by the time I was done, I\u2019d eaten 16 hot dogs in five minutes, beating my gf\u2019s dad, who only ate 12 hot dogs.\u00a0 When I was done, my gf\u2019s brother Liam (14M) and a bunch of his friends mobbed me, calling me \u201cThe Doggler\u201d, giving me high-fives and clapping me on the back. They said that I had dethroned The Doggler, pointing to my gf\u2019s dad, and that I was the new Doggler, that I was a real \u201cglizzied rizzler\u201d (or something like that) and that I was just shoving \u201cglizzy after glizzy down my gullet\u201d. They posed for pictures with me. It was weird but kind of fun.\u00a0 Later, my gf\u2019s dad came up to me, shook my hand, and said I was good competition. He went home to do something in his woodshop, so I hung out with my gf, Liam, and his friends, going around to various food stalls and games. When we all ate dinner that night, the hot dog contest didn\u2019t come up at all, except for when Liam kept referring to me as The Doggler and saying that he wanted to make a special Doggler shirt for me. We had a nice breakfast the next morning. No sign that anything was wrong. Today though, my gf brought up in our argument that her dad was actually really wounded by losing the hot-eating contest, but just didn\u2019t say anything to me. I said if I wasn\u2019t supposed to enter the contest, then was it really a contest at all? And she said that it was less about the contest but about the special Doggler shirt (Liam made his dad a Doggler shirt for the years he won the contest, but I got the Doggler 2024 shirt). She said that her dad only wanted to win the contest to connect with Liam and, if anything, I should be able to understand the masculine ego. So reddit, AITA? Edit: posted the shirt...

        "selftext": "I was appointed the personal representative of my friend/ex-spouse\u2019s estate, which includes a motorcycle. My 32-year-old daughter believes I should give it to her. I have two main reasons for hesitating. First, anything I sell from the estate must go toward settling debts and financing the remodeling of the property, which she is fully aware of. Second, she has a history of financial irresponsibility that I choose not to support. She hasn\u2019t adjusted her lifestyle despite past financial struggles and frequently points out that I have money because I travel internationally. For context, I am a retired, single 54-year-old woman. In the past, I made her an authorized user on my credit card to help her build credit, with strict instructions to use it only for emergencies and to be fully responsible for any charges. However, she once asked to charge a specific amount but exceeded it by $700. She made a few small payments, and I ended up covering the rest\u2014so when she charged $2,500 in July 2023, I insisted she repay it in full. She has only paid off about 50%, and for several months, she didn\u2019t make payments, citing financial difficulties. Her car was repossessed in August 2024, but she currently uses her partner\u2019s vehicle to get around. Before that, she relied on LA\u2019s transit system. She recently told me she doesn\u2019t want her live-in partner to work, which I found frustrating\u2014especially since she still owes me money. In my opinion, if you\u2019re struggling financially, both partners should be working. But ultimately, that\u2019s their choice. I told her that owing me money while simultaneously choosing to be in a one-income household felt like a slap in the face. Now, she wants me to gift her a motorcycle, even though I need to sell estate assets to settle debts. To top it off, she says she has surveyed her friends, and they all agree that I\u2019m being mean, unfair, and uncaring. Would I be the asshole for refusing? Update: Thank you for your comments and insight. I got it INTA, but it\u2019s past time for me to set strict boundaries.  Btw he isn\u2019t her dad and they had no relationship. She is no longer a user on any of my credit cards. ",

He requested I send links to things I want because he isn\u2019t creative to know what I want. He likes when I just tell him things \u2014 clear and direct. If I do not ask for a gift (birthday, Christmas, etc) I\u2019m not receiving anything. This happened in 2024. He asked me to pick an engagement ring out because he just couldn\u2019t decide. He TOLD ME HE WOULD BUY THIS NECKLACE 2 years ago, and I\u2019ve waited this long. I sent links, photos, we have walked through pandora together to see what it is I wanted. We are in couples counseling to work on communication and putting in effort since he struggles with it. He\u2019s well aware he struggles with this. So for everyone telling me to just buy it myself, it defeats the purpose of him saying he will buy it and requesting links to what I want. I thought about buying it myself for quite a while, but I have waited patiently for him to put in the effort and keep his word.  My husband (28m) and I(29f) have been married nearly a year now, and our anniversary is coming up soon. Ever since we have dated I have expressed how I\u2019d love a dainty initial necklace with the letter d to wear daily. Corny? Sure, but I love it. Anyway\u2026after a year of not receiving the necklace I started showing him pictures on Etsy of the ones I love (small gold plates with a lower case d in typewriter font \u2014 all of them were this font and style) we even walked through pandora to the custom engraved section and how he could write it and that would be very precious and meaningful to me. He thought it was neat and this whole time I thought he was absorbing what I was saying and listening. All he absorbed was the word \u2018dainty\u2019 apparently. This comes down to this morning. He expressed he was bored at work (night shift and he works for weeks at a time 1000 miles away from me). And this morning he bought a small (in size) but very thick bulky d necklace is some kind of frilly cursive that doesn\u2019t even look like a d. We share an email and I had literally opened it to check our daily emails like I do daily and it refreshed and there was the purchase. I texted him and expressed that it\u2019s absolutely nothing like I\u2019ve expressed for years. I\u2019ve waited this long for a necklace \u2014 I want to actually like and wear it. He told me I wanted dainty and that it is dainty, and I tried to explain dainty and delicate doesn\u2019t just mean in size and he googled it sent me the definition of dainty. I told him it was absolutely nothing like I\u2019ve shown him for years and to just cancel the order. Naturally this makes me ungrateful in his eyes. AITAH?",

        "selftext": "I (16M) have been told by my parents that I need to sleep in the basement to accommodate my younger cousins who are sleeping over for a week. My relatives have recently moved to where we are and they are still settling in, my family decided to help them by letting them stay over for a week or so. Our house isn\u2019t that big so I don\u2019t know why my parents even decided that, and FYI I am an only child. So it happens, they settle in our house but the problem is literally the entire house is cramped at this point. Luggage\u2019s and bags are everywhere, my uncle and aunt are sleeping in the living room, my cousin who\u2019s around the same age as me is sleeping in a small 1-person DIY guest bedroom (it\u2019s just a small unused room that barely has any space) and my 2 younger cousins are going to be sleeping in my room. Now, my room is also pretty small, combined with my desk, bed, closet, and more. Only 2 people can sleep in it, so my parents ask me to sleep in the basement and my aunt and uncle agreed. I flat out refused, our basement isn\u2019t the worse but it\u2019s dusty in there and cold. And even if I did, I had to sleep on an uncomfortable mattress with nothing but a thin blanket and a pillow probably and that would be super uncomfortable. I wouldn\u2019t want my younger cousins to go through that too but it was MY bedroom. I asked if I could sleep in my parent\u2019s room instead but as I said every room in our house is pretty small, my parents room is also filled with the different stuff they had when they moved. My parents got kind of pissed off at me and we had an argument. It ended up with me going over to a friend\u2019s house and sleeping there for the entire week my relatives were there. EDIT: I realized I didn\u2019t put enough info, sorry for that. But one, the basement is really cold now, even with a heater because I don\u2019t think the insulation done in our basement was ever done properly (?) and hence the reason why most of our unused stuff is down there because we barely go down there. Two, I\u2019m not allowed to take my own bedding with me, just an extra blanket which is thinner than my usual blankets + a pillow because my cousins are using them.",

        "selftext": "About 3 weeks agoI (50m) and my wife (46f) put up a basketball hoop in my driveway for my 12f and 10f children to practice basketball (they play on basketball teams).  I live in an HOA and checked the CC&Rs prior , found nothing in there restricting this.  Last week I got the following text:  \u201cJack\u201d, respectfully, may we get basketball quiet hours from 4-6pm on weekends and 4:30-6:30 on weekdays? The constant bouncing of the ball is very disturbing of our senior rest time in the late afternoon. Thanks for considering. \u201cJohn\u201d After again checking the county code and CC&Rs and consulting with my sister and friend (both attorneys), I wrote the following response a few days later: \u201cJohn\u201d,   I\u2019ve considered and discussed your request with my wife. While we want to be good neighbors and have met your prior requests, your current request for \u201cquiet hours\u201d during the late afternoon is unreasonably restrictive.  In reading the County Noise code section <x> (Noise Ordinance) and the CC&Rs, it appears that quiet hours as defined in the County code are 10pm-7am M-F and 10pm-9am Sat-Sun.  The CC&Rs document is silent on additional quiet hours beyond county code.  You\u2019re asking for a restriction on their prime playtime between school and dinner for your senior rest time.  I\u2019m somewhat sympathetic to your dilemma, since I work from home mostly. During business hours, I hear all manner of <neighborhood noises>.  I have found a set of noise canceling headphones very essential and effective. My children certainly don\u2019t play basketball daily and while I have not measured the sound pressure level inside the  house yet,  I have a hard time with thinking it approaches anywhere near 55 dBA limit as defined in the County Noise Ordinance.  Thank you for your understanding. Fairly quickly, that night I received this response: Wow, \u201cJack\u201d....Your response is  really over the top. We were simply asking for some neighborly consideration, and certainly not expecting a legal brief in response. The noises you describe do happen, are sporadic, and cease. The basketball is a constant bouncing on concrete under our bedroom and living areas, which is a completely different experience. Frankly, we were surprised the court was installed without the simple kindness of a conversation as our lot lines are very minimal.  The impact to our home enjoyment is substantial, and your suggestion that we live in headphones at the behest of your basketball whims is ludicrous. We are shocked at your unneighborly response, which is lacking in basic kindness. Consideration for the fact that we are over 70 and need some quiet periods to rest in our home is what we were seeking, as well as open rapport so that we may continue to enjoy our neighborhood together. The past 12 plus years have been a very pleasant experience for us. We wrongly assumed that you simply didn't realize the impact on our living space from your sport court and were opening a dialogue.",

        "selftext": "I promised my mother (64f) that I (29m) go with her to Tanzania. She's always wanted to go, and talked about it for years but since she divorced my Dad (over a decade ago) hasn't had anyone to go with. My wife (27f) pointed out that once we have children, the chances of me going on a 3-week vacation alone will be pretty low and by the time our children grow up, my mother might be too old to travel long distances - so I told my Mom I wanted to go with her. She cried she was so happy.  The trip was booked for March. My wife has been nothing but supportive. Unfortunately, my wife and I have struggled to conceive. We have been trying for 2 years and moved country recently, away from my mother. I assured my mother the trip was still going ahead.  My wife and I recently had our first round of IVF and it failed. The doctors had been confident because my wife is still young but it didn't. My wife and I took this news hard - especially my wife. I won't go into the details but despite only being 27 my wife has some significant fertility issues. We found out that we are probably never going to have a child, even with IVF. My wife's mental health after the IVF failure declined and what made matters worse is the day we found out it failed, I had to go on a 2 week business trip. My wife was left on her own, in a new foreign country, with no family or friends, starting a new job, grappling with this awful news on her own. My wife lost weight and is now under supervision by a psychiatrist and psychologist and medicated daily.  When I came home I saw my wife was skeletally thin and struggling to get out of bed every day. Leaving her on her own is not an option for the foreseeable. I called my mother and explained the situ. I told her I wanted to delay our trip by 10 weeks so that my wife could finish her treatment and come with us. It was a win-win. My mother gets her trip, I'm still a good son but most importantly I don't abandon my wife. (Of course I offered to pay for all additional costs including new flights so my mother wasn't out of pocket).  My mother was initially supportive. She said she understood and thought the compromise was sensible. She even offered to come see us in our new country in March to give us support.  A week later, my mother called me and said she's disappointed about the trip being postponed and that we had let her down. She said with my wife coming that the trip would be different to what she expected. She said she can't handle the thought of it potentially being postponed again (we never said it would be) and no longer wanted to go on the trip at all. She said she never wanted to speak about the trip either. She cancelled the flights and asked my wife and I to refund her for everything, which we did. Once we paid her back, she stopped answering my texts. She hasn't once reached out to my wife (who she's known for 10+ years and knew how much children means to her) about the IVF, the trip - nothing. Or me.  AITA? ",

        "selftext": "AITA or is my partner just forcing me to conform to their principles & values? Hi all, I need some 3rd pov on this matter. For context, my partner & I have been dating for slightly under a year now but recently we had the stupidest fight I\u2019ve ever had in my entire dating life. My partner is a great cook and likes to cook for me. It helps that he is a non picky eater and eats everything and anything. For me, yes I admit I am picky but I do give things a try before totally deem the food items as likeable or eww.  So recently my partner made vegetable pancakes and included shiitake mushrooms in them. My partner knows that I absolutely hates it in any dish but he loves it so I don\u2019t mind if he puts it in \u2018cause when I eat it I\u2019ll just pick it out. I even provided alternative mushroom options for him to include (though by my preference I rather not have any mushrooms to be included but as a compromise & cos I love him so I force myself to accept alternatives) We kept having these repeated fights where he mentions that when I pick things out of my food, it makes my appreciation for his cooking as conditional? (let me just highlight I repeatedly thank him for cooking every time, hugs him and even do the dishes sometimes). It also shows that I have no table manners and I must be spoilt by parents while growing up, which makes me feel very frustrated and puzzled at the same time.  I don\u2019t do this in public settings or during family meals, only when it\u2019s just the 2 of us. During group meals I make a conscious effort to take a bite out of everything & only take repeated ones at the one I like. He said that if he ever did what I did when he was a child, his parents would have scolded him and thrown him out, which to me sounded like a trauma response & him projecting onto me.  I told him we\u2019re 2 consensual adults and I\u2019m not stopping him from putting in the mushroom but I just prefer not to eat it. I don\u2019t make him cook 2 different versions, I just force myself to eat it or I\u2019ll pick them out when I can. He refuses to let me pick them out and somewhat insists that I should follow him and be grateful that someone even bothers to cook for me, to which I feel that at this point I feel borderline suffocated to have to pretend to like some ingredient in a dish when I really really don\u2019t like it. So am I really the asshole? is there a way around this? ",

        "selftext": "Throwaway account.   So I (19F) took a gap year off of university after my first year for my health and also to earn some money. My aunt (42F) has two children 11M and 7F, and she asked if I could live with them and help her as an in help childcare, and she pays me for it.  I accepted, and have been staying with her and her husband (43M) for a few months now. Problems started because I realized that my nephew frequently picks on and bullies his younger sister. Ripping the heads of her stuffies, breaking her toys, ripping her drawings, etc. He frequently makes fun of her and is overall terrible to her. I have tried multiple different attempts to stop it, having a heart-to-heart with him, taking away his gadgets, grounding him, etc, but the behavior stops for a week at best before he starts again. His parents are not much help because my Aunt is always tired, she makes a lot from a demanding job and comes back and cleans up around the house, and makes dinner. My uncle comes back from work and doesn\u2019t contribute to the house chores in anyway, and when I brought up taking my nephew to therapy he dismissed it as \u2018pseudo science.\u2019 He is very averse to therapy. Now where the issue started, is I overhear my niece and nephew fighting again, and I immediately assume he\u2019s started something again and ask him to please give his sister a break. I learned that his sister was the cause of the fight this time, she poured water on his Nintendo switch, damaging it. I apologized for blaming him, and pulled her aside and asked her why she did it as she is not the type to do that. She said that she wanted her brother to stop picking on her and she wanted to get back at him. My Uncle comes home and says that I should give her the same punishment as his son to be fair, and was angry that I only made her write an apology letter to him, instead of grounding her or taking away her tablet. I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s fair to punish her the same way for her first offence, but he said that I was picking favorites and that he could see I was biased. So, am I the asshole? *edit, we are not blood related but basically grew up together and my mom and Aunt are practically family. I call them niece/ nephew because I always have tbh \ud83d\ude2d sorry English is not my first language \ud83d\udc80*",

        "selftext": "I\u2019m 38 year old physically disabled male currently living in a group home until I can regain my mobility and independence. Over the past year of so I\u2019ve developed a friendship with another resident who isn\u2019t great at managing their money. I\u2019m the type of guy who likes helping people and people go to seeking advice or at least support. Over that time I loaned him about $600. He\u2019d make some payments but often ask for that amount back within a week. I eventually put my foot down and stopped loaning him money.  Then one of his three daughters was killed, then the second died from an illness. I gave him more money in loans and gifts to help him with these extraordinary times. I probably loaned him about $150 and gave him $100 for travel to see his family and help with a headstone and flowers. A week ago his last remaining daughter\u2019s son died of COVID and I gave him another $110 loan for travel and funeral expenses but he still wants more. I\u2019m on fixed income right now and will probably be for at least the next year and a half. I\u2019ve basically written this money off in my mind but I feel I can\u2019t just keep throwing money to him. Right now he wants money for dress clothes or says he won\u2019t go to his grandsons services. It\u2019s tearing his daughter up and it feels like the emotional blackmail he\u2019s used against me before when he keeps telling me a true friend would help. My family say I\u2019m in the right cutting him off but it hurts my heart. I just need people unconnected to the situation to give me their opinion. Thank you all for reading this and your thoughts  Update: Thank you all for your kind words and the reality checks on if these deaths are real. It\u2019s funny how those happened after he couldn\u2019t manipulate me in other ways. He is cut off. I do have records of what he owes me but I\u2019ll never get it back. I\u2019ll just have to think of it as good karma and a lesson but try not to let it harden my heart just make me smarter in who I believe. I still want to be the loving caring guy I am just not so trusting. It\u2019s something I\u2019ve done many times before and helped a lot of people but been burned a lot too. I get told much of what you all told me by friends and family but I need it from people who don\u2019t know me for me to believe it\u2019s true and not just something they have to say.

        "selftext": "Last year, I (19F now) celebrated my 18th birthday on January 5th. In the Philippines, this is a debut,\u201d which is similar to a quincea\u00f1era. It was a huge event for my family, especially since everyone was already together after New Year\u2019s. I had professional photos taken for the occasion, but I also wanted a special picture with my cat on the special day. I have a male orange tabby who was once a stray and is now fixed, named Tang. He\u2019s a huge part of my life, and I always keep him inside the house unless I\u2019m with him.   On my debut, I was looking for Tang to take that special photo, but I couldn\u2019t find him anywhere. I started panicking because he\u2019s an indoor cat and never goes far. I asked my cousins to help me look for him, but it was difficult as there's a lot of orange strays in the area. Eventually, my cousin (25M) came up to me and said he had found him. He pulled what looks to be meat out of a bag, and my heart dropped, I thought he had killed my cat. I completely broke down, crying and freaking out in front of everyone. (As much as I hate it, both dog and cat still get butchered for meat here but hidden away from the authorities) As it turned out, my cousin was pulling a prank. What he had was actually rabbit meat to be cooked for my birthday (rabbit meat also made me fully uncomfortable. I didn't eat that dish.) It just seriously looked like a cat's anatomy and it freaked me out. I found out that he had taken Tang to my uncle's without asking me because my family thought Tang was \u201cgetting in the way\u201d while food was being prepared for my party. I was furious. I yelled at my cousin, told him to return Tang immediately, and demanded that he leave the celebration. He left, I was upset but I didn't let it bother me as Tang was safe. Fast forward to this year. I didn\u2019t want my cousin at my birthday party because of what happened last year, and I made that clear to my parents. Despite this, my aunt insisted that I was being dramatic and said my cousin should be allowed to come. He showed up uninvited, I confronted him and told him again that he wasn\u2019t invited. He told me to take a joke and that it was in the past. I snapped and told him I didn\u2019t ever want to see him again. My aunt jumped in, calling me a \u201cbig bitch\u201d and accusing me of being narcissistic for making my birthday about myself. (ISN'T IT SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT MYSELF?) The argument escalated until my dad and granddad stepped in. My aunt and cousin eventually left, but it didn\u2019t end there. A few days later, my aunt started posting in the family group chat, calling me rude, difficult, and selfish. That I couldn't take a joke or that I don't know how to forgive and that I will be sent to hell. She claims that I ruined my debut and this year\u2019s birthday celebration with my behavior.

        "selftext": "Throwaway for privacy. (Edit: Update posted at the bottom) So I (24F) work at a high school with my co-workers Carrie (29F), Leslie (26F) and Marissa (30F). All of us get along well, we eat lunch together everyday and go out for drinks to destress from work lol. Leslie and Marissa are a lot closer to Carrie than I am for context. Two weeks ago, Carrie made a group chat with our co-workers for her 29th birthday party but I wasn\u2019t included. I didn\u2019t know until Leslie asked me what present I was buying for Carrie. When I told Leslie that I didn\u2019t know about the party, she asked me if I was arguing with Carrie. Honestly I wasn\u2019t mad about not being invited. Me and Carrie aren\u2019t that close and she can choose whoever she wants as her birthday guests. Leslie told me the date and place of Carrie\u2019s party but I didn\u2019t plan to go because I don\u2019t want to be rude and come uninvited. Last Saturday was Carrie\u2019s birthday. I sent her a happy birthday message and hope that she enjoys her day. Carrie said thank you and we had a small conversation about her plans. I didn\u2019t get an invite from her so I decided to stay home. On Sunday, I got some text messages from Marissa that went like this: Marissa: \u201cHey why didn\u2019t you go to Carrie\u2019s bday party last night?\u201dMe: \u201cOh I\u2019m not in her group chat so I thought that I wasn\u2019t invited\u201dMarissa: \u201cdidn\u2019t Leslie tell you where it was? You could\u2019ve shown up\u2026\u201dMe: \u201cYeah but Carrie didn\u2019t invite me, I don\u2019t want to be rude by coming without her knowing\u201dMarissa: \u201cBut still we\u2019re coworker besties\u2026 you should\u2019ve asked Carrie if you could go\u201dMe: \u201cIf Carrie wanted me at her bday she would have told me. We talked yesterday morning\u201d (convo ended there) Today\u2019s now Friday (5 days since then) and the three of them completely avoid me. We used to eat lunch together in the staff lounge but now they eat in Carrie\u2019s classroom. And whenever I pass one of them during morning duty they just stare and ignore. The past few days were really rough and I\u2019ve cried during my lunches because they were my support system since I started teaching. I genuinely thought we were friends but now I\u2019m just rethinking about everything. AITA for not going? \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Update: Earlier today I sent a message to both Leslie and Marissa telling them how I felt. Leslie left me on read. Marissa sent me this text in verbatim: \u201cOkay is that how you feel? After everything that I did to help you when you were struggling? Dont talk to me at work\u201d Later Carrie asked if she can call me. According to her, Leslie texted the group chat that I was going (even though I wasn\u2019t invited??). So Carrie reserved a spot for me at her birthday dinner. When I didn\u2019t show up, Carrie took it as me ghosting her. She was upset and told everyone else what happened, hence the silent treatment. I told her that I never got an invite and our previous conversation didn\u2019t imply that I was attending. We kept talking for a bit and in the end Carrie needed some time to think about the situation. Will I continue being friends with them? \u2026No. I\u2019ll be cordial but keeping it strictly work-related. I\u2019ll have to find some better friends. \ud83e\udee0 **TLDR**: Coworker planned a party that I wasn\u2019t invited to. I chose not to go, but another coworker lied that I was attending. Everyone thought I bailed out and gave me the silent treatment. Lesson learned, don\u2019t trust some of your coworkers. Workplace drama is not worth it.",

It's a family of 5 and our house isn't the biggest and only has 1 bathroom, so that's 7 people in the house when it was only just 2. We gave them 120 days to find to find a job and a place for themselves. They all found jobs but they couldn't find an actual place to stay so they are renting bedrooms and now upset with us. It's like they weren't even trying to find a place to stay. It seemed as if they got too comfortable. If they were looking they would have asked me for help but they asked me maybe once but that's about it. They weren't proactive about it at all and now they are mad at us. I told my wife they had to leave and now everyone is upset with me. AITA? ",

Very busy bees and it's been a minute since I've done the puppy thing and never two together its been an adjustment.  We discussed before hand and I had very specific conditions, namely regular walks and we had to commit to training so they'd be well adjusted and we could travel with them easily.  My partner was very on board so we adopted towards the end of last year and started puppy classes within a week. Our initial puppy coarse was 6 weeks long and by week 4 they were miffed about going and sacrificing their Saturday mornings.  By the last week they were glad it was finally over, I took over doing the homework with both pups by week 4 because it irritated them. The pups weren't picking things up fast enough for them so I thought it would be better for the pups for me to take over. They did 1 walk and complained because the puppy was weaving around and not walking at heel properly so I've taken over those aswell, we have started basically obedience now and I'm training both. There are alot of other examples should anyone want more info but essentially partner is now broody and wants a baby.

She also said EBV is not contagious and she got it from a raw vegetable. I paid for my nails and was asked to donate her the money for her personal needs. I (30f) found a good manicurist (Nina, fake name) a few months ago. I\u2019ve been to her salon 4-5 times. Sadly, the Nina (40f) has Multiple sclerosis and EBV and she needs stem cells transplantation. She is planning on opening a charity fund, because she cannot afford to pay for that - 50kThis is all very sad and I wanted to help her once fund is set up, of course. The thing is, the last time I went to the salon, Nina asked me to give her money ($50) because she couldn\u2019t pay her bills. I of course sent her the money, I felt really bad for her and didn\u2019t hesitated for a second. BUT. Almost a week after, she called me and asked for ($300) because apparently she has mistaken an amount of the bill for which I sent her the $50 in the first place. I couldn\u2019t send her that much money and offered to give her $50 again and she said \u201cOkay\u201d. I felt weird because I\u2019ve been to the salon a few times, we\u2019re not friends or anything and I don\u2019t think is okay to call your clients and ask for money. She also called a friend (30f) of mine, who went to Nina\u2019s salon as well and Nina asked her for $300 too. After that I cancelled my appointment and went to a new nail salon. (Keep in mind, I\u2019ve been at her salon just 5 times!) The manicurist called me to ask what\u2019s wrong and I said that it\u2019s not okay for me to be asked for money (twice) and I understand that she\u2019s in a difficult situation, but that\u2019s not the way to earn money. She said I\u2019m an a-hole and I can afford to help her and I\u2019m insensitive.  Also I want to mention that at the moment there is no charity fund and I would\u2019ve help with donations once it\u2019s set up. Am I wrong?",

I filled out a couple sheets of documentation and history info, and I lined up behind someone else to hand it in. The woman in question was leaning on a box of vitamins nearby. It looked like she was browsing the aisle endcaps. As I was next in line, she walked in front of me, slammed her Costco card down, and turned away. I was confused and an elderly couple nearby also looked shocked. Therefore, I politely said the line was here, and I did not care that she was leaning on a box nearby. She then pretty much freaked out. I am a much taller guy at 6ft 2, and she was smaller so she started to back away while calling me rude. I kept on simply trying to explain where the line started. She just backed away and kept calling it rude. Finally, the pharmacist came out and basically asked what was the problem and separated us. I got to hand in the form and took a seat. Then, the pharmacist made me wait 1.5hrs before getting a shot, she spent most of the time sitting there and talking with her friends. The actions of the pharmacist made me question whether I was right or wrong.   I\u2019m not sure if I should have been the bigger person and let them first?",

I have a friend, who i will call Lara (25F), and she unfortunately has a problem with punctuality. She has a tendency to be at least 20 minutes late, but there have been times where she has even been 40-50 minutes late. This is not due to traffic, but because she starts getting ready late and goes out of the house 5 minutes before our agreed time if not later. I have told her multiple times that i do not appreciate it. For example, I have sat alone in a restaurant for half an hour to make sure we did not lose the reservation. And this is just one of the situations which leave me frustrated. Other than that, she is a good friend and we have Lots of fun hangouts together. Well yesterday evening it was very cold and windy outside (1 Degree Celsius), and we had planned to meet in the city centre and go for food and drinks afterwards. I had texted her to remind her to leave her house on time. It takes me around 40 minutes to get there, so I cannot spontaneously just exit the house and be there, I have to plan my time. When I arrived, I was right on time (as opposed 10 minutes earlier, because I know it\u2019s useless with her anyway) and I started waiting. After around 30 minutes I lost my patience, texted her to forget it and just left. I was cold and in a bad mood, especially because she told me that she would be there \u201cright away\u201d. She apparently was there 15 minutes later and called me upset, that I don\u2019t understand how she is and I am being a bad friend. That I should not make plans if I am not okay with waiting, which I did not agree with. Still, I have never left like this before and I feel guilty for leaving her like this. Was I the asshole? Little update I have left in the comments: She called me a few hours ago, and we talked for a bit. She apologized for insulting me, ignoring my messages AND for being late this time. She sounded like she really regretted it, but I was a bit bitter about the fact that I had to take it this far for her to wake up. I did not talk about meeting up again, as I just want to let it sink in a bit more and not just two days. And I think afterwards I will use one of the suggestions that said to meet in a cafe and give her a range, such as \u201cI will be here from 15 to 15:30\u201d, and see how that works out. I truly don\u2019t want to lose her and I was sorry to hear her like this, but she hurt me first and she needs to understand that too",

        "selftext": "Hi! Sorry for the weird formatting since this was done on mobile + on a throwaway account since I don\u2019t want my family finding this out. I\u2019m really desperate for the insight of people who don\u2019t know me and aren\u2019t biased. My parents 54m and 56f have shared custody of me, 16f, so I stay one week in my dad\u2019s house and a week in my mom\u2019s house. My dad and mom both remarried, mom married Josh, 57m and dad married Alice, 50f. I have always had good relationship with my stepmom, she always treated me nicely, and insisted I mustn\u2019t see her as a mom but as a friend. keep in mind she is much wealthier than my dad, and purchased his house and the beach house they currently own. For Christmas, me and my sister, Selena, 19f, decided to go to my stepmom\u2019s beach house with my dad and step sibling. also keep in mind that the beach has insects and spiders, as it is very tropical + I have a serious debilitating phobia of spiders which all of my family knows about. Everyday I used to find spiders in my room, which was really hard to deal with, since I would just try to pretend I didn\u2019t see them until I could find someone to get them out. Regardless, one day, my stepmother was helping me get the spider that was in my pillowcase, of course, I freaked out.  I suggested that I could get an Uber to my mom\u2019s place, which isn\u2019t far away, since I really wasn\u2019t enjoying the vacation because of that but could see them in the city for New Year\u2019s Eve. she got extremely upset at that, saying that I was nothing more than a spoiled little b word and that I was a cow and that I could just call my mom but nobody wants me in their house anyway. I started ugly crying, this wasn\u2019t the first time she called me stuff like that but we had a friendly relationship now. I called my mom and she threatened my dad, who defended my stepmom, and called him a bad father, and now is fighting for full custody of me and that really hurt my father. I know that this has caused a strain on my dad and stepmother\u2019s relationship, and that if they divorce my father is losing the house and a place to live, as he doesn\u2019t work and makes money anymore. My sister is blaming me, saying I could have stayed a few more days,  but my mother says no matter how I freaked out, Alice could never say these things to me. Was I the AH? How do I navigate this?",

My bus is normally overcrowded, and people tend to bring their friends on my bus which causes it to be more overcrowded than normal.

Did I really make the wrong decision telling the assistant principal that I don't want a random 14 year old sitting on my lap? Why couldn't they have asked somebody else to let her sit in their lap. I don't think anyone would've said yes, and does that mean they'd give our entire bus detention?

        "selftext": "(29f) I'm having a Vegas wedding in August and my fianc\u00e9 (31m) and I decided to make it a weekend celebration with all kinds of activities leading up to the big day. One of the activities on the itinerary is to attend a brunch/pool party spot where you have to pay to rent cabanas and chairs. My best friend (30f) said that as a gift from her and her boyfriend, they would rent a cabana for the four of us. I put gift in quotes because in my mind, when you give something as a gift, you relinquish all control over that item and the person you gave the gift to has complete control over what they want to do with said gift. So since she said the cabana was a gift for me and my fianc\u00e9, we said that we don't mind sharing it with the rest of our guests. However, my best friend is really adamant about my other friends/guests not being able to join us in the cabana unless they pitch in some money. So I assumed, if she's trying to control what we do with the cabana, then it's really HER cabana and she's just sharing with us. So I told her that I appreciate the gesture, but I'd rather rent my own cabana and share with everyone because if I'm going to have a huge cabana anyway, I'm not gonna charge my friends to sit with me. I don't mind sharing with my friends. And I get that my friend group is not affiliated with her, she doesn't owe them anything and that's fine, which is why I told her that she can go ahead and get her own cabana and I'll just get my own that i can share. But she's arguing that her intent was not to buy her own cabana but to buy it for me and my fianc\u00e9 and she doesn't see the point in having two large cabanas. Now she seems to be pretty disappointed that I refused her gift. AITAH?",

My sister, however, assumes I\u2019m always available, often texting me last minute to \u201cdrop them off for a few hours\u201d that turn into entire days. Recently, I told her that I\u2019d be happy to continue babysitting, but I\u2019d like to be compensated, even if it\u2019s just a little bit to cover my time. She got really upset and said \u201cfamily shouldn\u2019t charge family\u201d and accused me of being selfish because I don\u2019t have kids and \u201cdon\u2019t understand what it\u2019s like.\u201d I feel guilty because I know she\u2019s a single mom and struggling, but at the same time, I feel like my kindness is being taken for granted. Our parents think I should \u201cjust help out\u201d because \u201cthat\u2019s what sisters do,\u201d but I\u2019m starting to feel resentful. AITA for asking to be paid for babysitting?",

        "selftext": "I (17F) am turning 18 in July. Because of this, I'm already starting to prepare what I'm going to take with me when I move out, even though that likely won't be a while because I also plan to move in with 2 of my close friends and we need to arrange where we'll be living first. Some things I definitely want to take with me when I move out are my gaming consoles. An Xbox 360, an Xbox One S, and a Playstation 4, all of which were given to me as birthday or Christmas presents. Because they were given to me specifically, I think it's only fair that I get to take them with me when I move out. However my mother doesn't seem to think so. My mother believes that I can only take one console with me, the ps4, and leave both Xbox consoles with them. Her justification for it is that she and my sister (5) won't have anything if I take all the consoles. She also said that it's a thing that when you get a new console the older one is passed down as a family console. I thought this was completely stupid, because they were given to me as gifts, and now she just expects me to leave 2 of them behind just so they can actually have gaming consoles. I'd like to add that I've spent my own gift money on both the ps4 AND xbox one to buy games and other things for certain games, but she's also bought quite a bit of stuff on the xbox too (DLCs for the Sims 4 mainly). That's another reason why she doesn't want me to take the xbox one, because she spent money on it herself. I feel like she's trying to just guilt trip me, but I need to know if I'm really in the wrong for wanting to take things that were given to me with me when I move out. WIBTA? Edit to add: I feel like I should have pointed this out originally, but my mother is acting like there would be absolutely no at home gaming consoles left in the house when that isn't the case at all. We have an old gamecube that has quite a few games too, all it needs is to get new cords to plug in to the tv and then the power button needs to be fixed because it's stuck pressed down Edit 2: since a lot of people are bringing up visiting my family when I move out and leaving one console there for them and switching the consoles out, that wouldn't be an option, if I leave a console it's gone for good. My parents haven't been the best people my whole life for more serious issues I didn't feel the need to go into before, but these things are making me decide to go no contact with my father and limited contact with my mother.",

        "selftext": "We had a terrible snow storm hit here last month. I had heard from some of the other family members that my MIL was staying in a car with my BIL, her son. On Christmas Day we told them to meet us  at a nice restaurant for Christmas dinner. What I saw was pitiful. They were both skin and bones. I told them they could hook a big heater up to their car and stay in our driveway until the storm passed. It has well passed and they are still here and we\u2019re cooking every meal for them which has put us in a financial strain.                                              My BIL has been on drugs for a while and can\u2019t hold down a job because of it. Since my MIL has stayed with him she is also doing heavier drugs and her mental health is declining. She lost her husband two years ago and since then is loosing her mind. She will talk about people stealing her name on Facebook and framing her to drag her to hell. She\u2019s always saying stuff like this. My BIL leaves a mess in the driveway, the neighbors have mentioned it to me. He also revs up his car and the neighbors have complained. My MIL is waiting on a \u201cbig check\u201d and has been for a year but I fear that has already been spent on drugs.                                               Everyone in the family has asked her to stay inside in a room and she wants to live out in the car with her youngest son and the poor dog he keeps in there. The dog has pooped in the car. My husband feels like they are his responsibility since his dad passed away. I told him he needed to give them tough love. I told him to give them money for a hotel for a week since he finally found a job at a restaurant and that they couldn\u2019t come back. My husband says I don\u2019t have a big heart like him because I\u2019ve never been homeless and he has. I feel like we need to push them out so that forces them to get their life together. I\u2019m torn because my MIL needs to be in a mental hospital but she would never forgive us if we went that route. AITA for kicking them out of here? (Side note, we\u2019ve tried letting the BIL stay in the guest room in here and he steals stuff and leaves the house a mess). ",

        "selftext": "Early on in our marriage I shared with my wife how my parents would buy treats and not share them with us kids. We were dirt poor to the point of going hungry, and sometimes they would buy things like ice cream or Fritos or something like that and it was hands-off for the kids.  So now here we are with four kids of our own. We are not poor, but we are not rich. We have an overstocked snack cupboard and the kids don't want for anything. They are free to get snacks as they want. We rarely deny them what they ask for. When we have a treat everyone gets it.  I really enjoy sitting down and drinking a cold sparkling water. Like a Bubly or a La Croix etc. It calms me down. My therapist even recommended it as a way to restart. The thing is the kids also love sparkling water so when we buy a 12 pack, it is gone in less than two days. Sure I've had a couple, but when I want one again, they are all gone. Sometimes we will go crazy and buy a couple Costco packs which just means that everyone drinks them at double the rate, and when I want one they are once again gone. Even if I expected there to be some.  I don't think it's a wise budget move for everyone in the family to constantly be drinking sparkling water, especially when we are trying to save money, but I want one when I want one. My wife and kids think this is selfish and my wife will remind me what I told her about my own family.  I want to be able to enjoy a sparkling water when I want, without the fear of them being gone. Sometimes I will hide a couple in the fridge and be extra upset when I discover they are gone. Shouldn't I at age 44 be allowed to have something of my own like sparkling water!? I've considered buying my own mini-fridge, but that seems ridiculous, and it's not cost or energy effective and how would that be different? I've asked my family to help me resolve this and they just think I'm being selfish and should just go without sparkling water when everyone else goes without, and have some when everyone else is having some.

        "selftext": "Title. My fiancee and I are in the planning phase of our wedding (yay) and I recently told my mom that a friend of mine (a very lovely Satanist metalhead) would be officiating the wedding as per The Satanic Temple wedding ritual. An argument ensued where she expressed to me that it was disrespectful. I told her that I had no intention of doing anything in poor taste, and that we wanted a fun wedding that was defiant and defied expectations. I asked her why she was offended, and if she was Christian, Catholic, etc. to which she replied no.  She texted me later that night and expressed that she didn't know *why* she told me she wasn't Catholic, and that she actually was. She then informed me that if we held the wedding like this, and included a satanic message, that she and my dad wouldn't attend. Since then there has been constant fighting with her and there has not been a resolution.  For context, I come from a very supportive non-religious family. My father is an atheist, and always has been. Until this issue with my mom, she had never been Catholic, never really gone to church, never raised us with a faith, never expressed theistic religion, or anything. It was however brought to my attention that when she and my dad got married, it was at a Catholic church (I was too young then to know this so it was news to me.) One of my mom's points is that doing a ceremony like this feels to her like an insult at her wedding ceremony directly, like we're doing it to defy her. I told her that it had nothing to do her and that it wasn't about her, to which she told me it was unfair to tell me things aren't about [her]. Added context, I am a trans woman marrying another woman. My parents love my fiancee dearly, and have been accepting and supportive of my identity for as long as I can remember. Now functionally, this is a normal wedding ceremony for all intended purposes. Truthfully, fiancee and I are just freaks who want a freak wedding. It's harmless, as is The Satanic Temple and its beliefs if you look them up. It's non-theistic, community service oriented religion in the loosest sense of the word. We just wanted to do something fun. The thing is, I have no intention of changing anything about our wedding to accommodate my mom. Fiancee's family is cool with it, all of my family members are cool with it- but my mom insists that she and my dad will not be attending if we hold the ceremony in this way.  Am I the asshole? Or is she being unreasonable? Edit for added context\u2022TST aligns with our values, and we aren't doing it for the image\u2022person doing the ceremony is my best friend and is fully supportive",

Fast forward to a few months ago, when Sarah came to me in tears saying she was drowning in debt. She had credit card bills, personal loans, and even payday loans just to get by.

I also furnished most of the place, including putting a 75\u201d TV in the living room. A few months in, I got pregnant and decided to go home to give birth, but I kept paying rent since I planned to return. Before leaving, I moved my TV into my locked bedroom. She could still use everything else, but I did this because she gets careless when high or drunk\u2014leaving keys in the door, passing out randomly, etc. I didn\u2019t want my things stolen or damaged. About a month later, she mentioned her brother was staying over. He was cool, so I had no issue with it. I was actually thinking of offering him my room since he was only staying a few days. But on FaceTime, I noticed a big TV in the background. I asked, \u201cOh, you got a new TV?\u201d She said no. \u201cDid he bring one?\u201d Again, no. Then she pans the camera and says, \u201cOh, we took yours out of your room. It just goes with the aesthetics.\u201d I said, \u201cBut my room was locked?\u201d She just shrugged. \u201cI used a knife to get in.\u201d Like it was nothing. I blacked out, cussed her out, and ended the call. Then I asked my maintenance friend from the complex to check things out. It wasn\u2019t just my TV\u2014my room was messy, my locked bathroom had been broken into, and both she and her brother had been wearing my clothes. I was livid. I called her, and she finally answered when I threatened legal action. She said it was selfish of me to put the TV in my room because they had nothing to use. Mind you, we both had TVs in our bedrooms. At that point, I was done. I had my sister and a friend clear out my stuff while she was at work. Anything we bought together, I sent her half the money for\u2014including the dining table, even though I was being petty when I took it. I also disconnected the electricity (didn\u2019t want her running up a spite bill) and stopped paying rent. Unfortunately, I lost the baby and returned earlier than planned. When I got back, the apartment was trashed. She had moved out, stopped paying rent, and now the delinquency is on both our credit reports. Years of friendship gone, just like that. No apology, no accountability, no nothing. Just one FaceTime call, and that was it. AITA for handling it this way? Should I have kept paying rent since moving in together was my idea?",

        "selftext": "Hello Reddit universe, first post. Let\u2019s get into it. I (38 M) have a girlfriend (Bonni) with a 13-year old son, and they live in a house with her sister. Her sister has a boyfriend, Dude, who comes around but doesn\u2019t live there. He normally carries a pistol on him. I haven\u2019t known him long, but he seems like a nice guy and we typically get along. He has seemed responsible with his guns which I appreciate, especially with kids around. I\u2019ve been around firearms my whole life and take gun safety seriously. The other night Bonni, her son and I get home to an empty house and as we are getting ready for dinner, she notices a small fanny pack on the kitchen table that doesn\u2019t belong to us. She moves it, notices it\u2019s heavy and asks me if I think there\u2019s gun in there. She handed it over and it was pretty obvious that\u2019s what it was. Knowing he likes to practice concealed carry, I wondered if it was loaded and ready to fire. So I unzipped the bag and took a look. I wanted to make sure Dude at least left it in relatively \u2018safe\u2019 condition. Thought about just moving it, but I really wanted to know the exact situation that was left unattended on the kitchen table.  What I found was a loaded Glock 9mm with a round in the chamber and ready to fire. It was holstered, but being a Glock, there is no traditional \u2018safety\u2019 on the gun and anyone could just pull it out and fire off a round. So I dropped out the magazine, cleared the round from the chamber, and put it back in his bag in a much safer condition than I found it.  I then text him telling him I did that, and let\u2019s make sure that doesn\u2019t happen again. He then calls me NOT to apologize, but to tell me how pissed off he is that I violated his privacy. A day later thought he\u2019d come to his senses but I hear that he is still livid and that I should apologize, although I have not heard a single bit of remorse or apology from him to Bonni for leaving an unsecured, loaded gun sitting out for anyone to get at.  In my mind, the safety of everyone in the house, especially the kid, is priority #1 and should far outweigh anyone\u2019s feelings of privacy violation. No, I wouldn\u2019t be stoked if someone in general decided to open and look in my bag. But if I were to make the huge mistake of leaving a loaded gun in a common area where a kid lives, if anything I\u2019d hope that someone responsible would do the same thing I did, make the situation safer, and help prevent any chance of my mistake becoming something much worse.  AITA for prioritizing this safety concern over Dude\u2019s privacy? UPDATE: To be fair I missed a detail - turns out he had given the gun to Bonni\u2019s sister to take with them to lock up, and she left it on the table on accident. ",

We told him right away that is no option for us and we don\u2019t want to spend our holidays with him.Since Cameron already booked his flights he joined without our permission and stayed in our prepaid accommodation.

A few weeks ago, her niece, we will call her Megan, (24 f) unexpectedly and very suddenly experienced the passing of her baby that was only a month old.  My birthday is coming up soon, so I extended the invitation to Megan. I was hoping that having a night out with friends would give her an opportunity to have a distraction. I told her that it was completely up to her of course, but she was more than welcome to join us.  Given that many people in our friend group have had questions and curiosity surrounding the passing, I included a warning to the guests that discussion about the baby, and of course his passing was off limits. I approved the message with Rose before posting it.  It reads: Hey ladies... for my birthday on the 25th, we're having dinner at (local restauran), probably around 5 pm, then to (local bar) for a bit afterwards.  ..Just so you know, Megan will be there and I'd appreciate everyone respecting her privacy. Discussion about (the baby) is off limits. We're there to have fun & I truly want her to be able to do that by any means necessary, as much as it is possible.   Let me know in the next week or so if you'll be able to make it so I can give a head count for a reservation.  This message caused one friend to call me crying because she thought it was directed at her and she was offended that I would think she'd do such a thing, necessitating a warning post. I explained that Megan is understandably very fragile right now and I was just trying to assure that no one said anything to upset her. This friend understood after our chat and everything was fine.  About 24 hours later another friend, (who was honestly more the target of my post due to the fact that she was asking me questions at an event we had recently attended together, while Rose & Megan were not present),left the group chat and deleted me from social media.  So, am I the a-hole for feeling the need to post a warning to protect Megan? ",

        "selftext": "Hi everyone I would really like to get some insight from everybody on what happened at our family Christmas. On the 23rd my sister-in-law had messaged me and told me that they are throwing a small Christmas party and she told me that her sister-in-law and her in-laws and her parents are all going to be joining them and they would really like for us to come as well. Very specifically she named everybody who was going to be there.(this will be relevant later). Later that night I showed my husband the text messages and said it would be really nice if we join them for Christmas as his whole family doesn\u2019t get along and it would be nice for his mom to see at least some of the siblings interacting. On Christmas Day I woke up early to make some things to bring over to their house and wrapped up the gifts that I had prepared for everybody as we approached their house we saw a vehicle that belong to a person that me and my husband, both don\u2019t get along with and have had major problems with in the past. I told my husband that maybe it\u2019s just a car that looks like his because his sister knows that we would not come over if we knew that this person was going to be there. We decided to walk in and give the gifts and say hi to everyone and both agreed that if said person was invited that we would just come up to his sister and brother-in-law and let them know that we are actually going to be leaving. Well, unfortunately for us he was there and we didn\u2019t want to make a big scene so I came up to his sister in the kitchen and said I\u2019m really sorry that we\u2019re leaving and that if I knew that he was invited we would\u2019ve just told her right away that we weren\u2019t going to come and I felt very bad For making the situation uncomfortable. she looked really disappointed, but understood and decided to walk us to the door. at this point, everything was fine until her husband ran in and started yelling and cussing and calling us names. this was pretty out of character for him, but also very inappropriate nonetheless especially because in my opinion, we didn\u2019t do anything wrong by leaving Christmas when we are uncomfortable with being around someone we don\u2019t like and wanted to avoid any conflict and not make a scene. he kept screaming and calling us names and telling us that he can invite whoever he wants to his house which we both never told him that he couldn\u2019t. The screaming continued and his kids in-laws and his parents all came to see what was going on me and my husband quietly put our shoes on and he slammed the door in our face so I\u2019m curious does this make us the assholes for leaving Christmas when we were unaware that a person we do not get along with was invited as well especially when his sister went out of the way to text me a list of everybody who is gonna be there but somehow leaving this person out.

The wedding is in another 6 months, the day we met/the day we got engaged, and I\u2019m going crazy with the planning. My fianc\u00e9 is such a mamas boy he\u2019s letting her take over the whole wedding!  So far she\u2019s chosen the flowers, the venue, and even the caterer\u2026 last week we had the cake tasting and I really liked the vanilla cake with strawberries but she kept on insisting for the chocolate cake saying \u201cit\u2019s more elegant\u2026\u201d I just lost it and went off on her about how she\u2019s taking over the whole wedding and that this is our day not hers. She got up and left so my fianc\u00e9 went after her leaving me alone to finish the tasting and go home by myself. Two days after I went to go see her to apologize for making a scene but also to explain how I felt. She was being dry and cold to me, which was expected, but she said she understands and she\u2019ll try to back off a little more now.  After I apologized, me and my fianc\u00e9 started fighting. I\u2019ve been telling him about this for months so yea it going to build up and that was my final straw. He started to make it about money saying that she is paying for most of the wedding so she is allowed to have a say. I told him its not about the money and that my parents have offered plenty of times to share the costs. I do ask her opinions on things just like I ask my mom but they are in between two things that I like not that she likes. We don\u2019t exactly have the same styles and this is my wedding day.  I\u2019m also starting to rethink the relationship because he always takes her side on everything and I really don\u2019t know if that\u2019ll ever change. I know that after his mom and I talked she went straight to him to talk about me. I don\u2019t know how I could live with a controlling mother in law that my husband will always back up over me.

        "selftext": "Please forgive me for bad english,not a native speaker. So back in our college days,we were a group of four, Me,Ethan,Vivian and Jayesh(names are changed). Jayesh was indian and he had come to our college to study(actually,me and jayesh were both foreigners who were here to study,I chose to settle down here).  Jayesh came from a very wealthy family,they have a very big jewellery business,from what I learned from jayesh,he was a native of the state rajasthan in india and people from that state are really famous for being involved in business and are ultra conservative(very religious,don't consume alcohol and meat etc).  Here is the where the story starts,we graduated about 4 years ago and were all busy in our lives but were still in touch with each other. As mentioned earlier,I too was a foreigner(from an eastern european country),but chose to settle in America,jayesh went back to India. One day jayesh had us all on a call and informed us that he is getting married in india and invited us to the wedding,he offered all of us first class tickets to and fro,the wedding took place in a five star hotel and the festivities lasted for a week,it was literally a free luxury vacation for us. Jayesh informed us beforehand that alcohol and meat based food won't be available in the wedding and we had no problem with that When we arrived in india and reached the venue,we were overwhelmed,there was different dresscode for each time of each day, tailors available to personally stich the clothes for the guests,sight seeing tours of the city and what not. Ethan seemed a bit miffed ,during the 4th day, when his discontent was getting way more visible,I asked him what the issue was,he said that this wedding feels so crappy without alcohol and food feels incomplete without meat,I told him that he was okay with it when the invitation was made and he can either suck it up and enjoy the wedding(it's not like the food was bad or anything,the food was great) or leave,which made him cranky for the entire trip. when we returned,he told me that it was rude of me to tell him to suck it up and he was forced to get through a dry wedding for a week,I told him that if he was miffed about alcohol and meat amidst all that grand festivities that basically made the wedding a free vacation,there is some serious issue with him and he is acting very ungrateful. AITA for saying that.",

        "selftext": "Husband (32m) and I (34f) both work full time day jobs M-F. He works a second job a couple Saturdays a month so we can (barely) afford to keep our 3m and 4f in preschool. When he has work on a Saturday, he expects me to stay home and be in charge of the monitor so he doesn\u2019t have to because he wakes up around 5:30 for work and works 12 hours. For context, kids are still on a monitor because the master is two levels below the kids\u2019 rooms.  I think that it\u2019s unreasonable. I rarely get to see my friends, and it\u2019s not like our kids wake up at night\u2014they\u2019ve been excellent sleepers since they were each 3 months old. The only time one of us has to go in at night is when a kid is sick or has a nightmare, both of which are rare.  Even so, I never get back after 10pm. And he goes to bed at 8 right after the kids, so it\u2019s not like he can\u2019t get a head start either. Additionally, we both get up before 6 for our day jobs and he goes to his hobby every Thursday, often staying out until 10 or later. And then gets up for work Friday with no issues. Last time I tried to go out a night before his second job because I wanted to go buy a dress for a friend\u2019s wedding that was two days later (because I had no other time to shop) and he FREAKED out at 8pm telling me I was ridiculous and needed to come home THAT MINUTE. Now I\u2019ve been up since 3:45am because I realized he works tomorrow (Saturday) and I accidentally scheduled a meetup with my friends at 7pm tonight, just before the kids go to sleep. He\u2019s going to be insufferable and insist I cancel which pisses me off to no end. We do sleep in separate rooms (have since my first pregnancy) so it\u2019s not like I\u2019m barging in after he\u2019s asleep. EDIT: Based on comments, here\u2019s some more info\u2026we sleep in different rooms because we have wildly different sleep habits. He works a second job instead of me because he makes 3x what I could in his side gig. We don\u2019t have any family who can help with watching kids. I try to avoid his work weekends, but when I made these with my friends, he didn\u2019t have his schedule for January yet. When I say \u201cout,\u201d I mean to friends\u2019 houses. He goes out every Thursday plus usually one other day a week. He DOES spend money because he skims some off the top of his side gig because he feels he deserves it. I don\u2019t get extra money because I don\u2019t work. He was the one who suggested I make an effort to go out more since I was resentful of being home with the kids virtually all the time\u2026but only when it\u2019s convenient for him (he complains every time anyway). When he is working 12 hours I am with the kids from the time they wake up until the time they go to sleep, so I would not consider that \u201coff.\u201d The one time I went dress shopping, the wedding was two days later and I hadn\u2019t been able to shop beforehand due to our jobs and husband\u2019s  social plans. EDIT 2: We both work full time M-F but only he has a second job. So, AITA? TLDR: Husband expects me to stay home when he has work early the next day so I can \u201cmind the monitor\u201d for our 3 and 4yos who don\u2019t wake up.",

        "selftext": "I used to work in the tourism industry and would get awesome travel discounts for myself and a companion. In 2019, I travelled with my aunt, and we had a great time. We\u2019re close\u2014we talk almost daily\u2014so travelling together felt natural. But in 2020, I changed jobs and lost those discounts, which led me to start planning big trips every five years to make them extra special. I just turned 39 and began organizing my 40th birthday trip, set for next year. Originally, I suggested places like Iceland or a cruise. My aunt vetoed them all, saying she wanted a ship with a casino (not my thing). Eventually, she seemed okay with a multi-city Europe trip\u2014London, Amsterdam, parts of Germany, Switzerland, and Paris. My sister liked those destinations but didn\u2019t want a motorcoach tour, so I decided on a train-based itinerary. I also invited other friends/family to join whichever legs they liked, since I\u2019m paying full price now. The conflict started when my mom mentioned that my aunt told her I must be \u201coff my meds\u201d for dreaming up such a plan. Here\u2019s where it stings: I have bipolar II, diagnosed 12 years ago. I take medication and follow personal rules against impulsive decisions\u2014I won\u2019t jump into something major without months of thought. This trip is more than a year away, so there\u2019s nothing rash about it. But my family sometimes attributes any emotional moment on my part to me being \u201cunstable,\u201d while my sister can have a bad day and get full sympathy. I\u2019m upset that my aunt gossiped about my mental health, especially since I\u2019ve asked her not to share my private details. She\u2019s done it before, but this time calling me \u201coff my meds\u201d felt disrespectful and hurtful. Now I\u2019m thinking of uninviting her from the trip altogether. On the one hand, it feels harsh because we\u2019ve travelled together and I wanted everyone to have the option to join. On the other hand, this is my birthday trip, I\u2019m covering my own costs, and I don\u2019t want to spend time with someone who dismisses my well-managed condition as \u201ccrazy.\u201d So, **WIBTA if I told my aunt she\u2019s no longer welcome on my 40th birthday trip** after she made those comments? Or should I just let it slide, knowing she\u2019ll gossip anyway? Edit: I had a number of comments suggesting the trip was free so I think I phrased it incorrectly in the original post. I would be paying for myself and everyone would be paying for their own portion of the trip. I'm considering their interests because they would also be paying to go on the trip. I don't like to travel solo as I've had a couple of bad experiences in the past related to my mental health while travelling so it's something of a safety in numbers situation. My aunt is retired and widowed so it's easy for her to join me on trips. Since my sister expressed interest I would be able to go with just my sister so I still wouldn't be solo. I get that it seems like I'm bending over backwards to accommodate everyone else but it's to my benefit in that I can travel with someone who is just as excited about travel as I am. I love travelling to experience new cultures and learn about art and history. This Europe train trip is just as exciting to me as Iceland or any other destination. I don't feel like I'm sacrificing for this itinerary but would be if I went on an ocean cruise. With regards to the gossiping, this is unfortunately something that my aunt and my mom's side of the family does often. They will gossip any chance they get. It's not something I enjoy but I was raised around it so am just used to it. If she only said it to my mom in concern that would be one thing but I know she's telling all of my extended family that I'm not close with and they're all imagining the worst-case scenarios. I also suspect that she will continue to use my planning this trip as source material for her gossiping. My mom shared what my aunt said in confidence which I appreciated because it could have continued happening behind my back without my knowledge. I haven't confronted my aunt because she would know that my mom told her and it would cause family drama. My plan if I do disinvite her would be to explain that I'm going to do something with my sister as a sibling trip or come up with a similar excuse that doesn't directly state the reason I'm not comfortable with her attending. The reason is if I say it's because of the comment, she'll know it was my mom and she may just double down on the gossip about me. I know this is ingenuine and I should be upfront but it feels easier to just let it pass instead of feeding the flame. I hope this extra info helps with your judgements. I'll continue responding to some comments when I feel it makes sense to. ",

I would like to prefix this with I am not seeking advice or criticism for how I wish to care for my mother or how they should have done better to save for retirement. I am not going to go into detail but please understand not every family is always capable of saving properly for retirement. Thank you for understanding. As for the situation I wish to seek judgment and prospective for. For the last four years I have been supplementing my mother's care she is 73 and has dementia. She is on Medicaid and does get some home care services what Medicaid does not cover I cover myself so currently she does have 24/7 care. This has worked out for around 4 years now, but I was recently offered a life altering opportunity and I am strongly considering on taking it. Our mother does live with me and my brother lives in the same state.  I spoke with my brother and asked since I know he cannot contribute financially could he contribute his time. I found a wonderful higher end memory care facility located near the apartment we lived in together my mom and I. Trying to keep her near what she remembers and stuff. I just asked if he would be willing to maybe have lunch with mom and check in on her. The memory care is located in Manhattan and my brother lives on Staten Island. My brother told me does not think he can visit often enough for it to be meaningful. I asked if our SIL could do it when the kids are in school. I offered to cover gas and ezpass.  He told me now and that I am an asshole for pushing the issue. I asked how am I being an asshole trying to keep mom comfortable. He asked why don't I take her with me. I told him how do expect our mom to handle a flight let alone move from NY to Europe? That is when he told me I took on this role of taking care of our mom so I have to figure it out. I mean I know my brother has beef with my me because I am part of the reason my parents could not save. We had to sell our house and move three times because of issues I caused in school. I tried to explain do it for our mom not me.  Any questions I will do my best to answer.  UPDATE: Thank you for all the replies and suggestions. I did try to answer as many questions as I could or felt comfortable with answering.  I wish clarify our family is fairly intertwined, we have dinner twice a month, every Holiday and Birthday is celebrated together my SIL and I do the planning and organizing. We go on vacations together, we took a road trip to FL just to go to Disney since flying is rough for our mom. We take weekends trips or outings often. My SIL takes our mom to do her nails and hair when I cannot.  This is why I was taken aback when he said no and did not give a reason, cause we already do so much. I also know my brother dislikes planning anything that is why I did the best I could to cover all the bases around our mother' care. I hired a care manger to handle appointments, renewals, coordinating care if I am not aviabile or if their is an emergency. They will be my boots on the ground. I did try to find placement on Staten Island but the options left much to be desired. I found one in the city and that is why I offered to cover the ezpass and gas. I was trying to make it as easy as possible but I forgot one thing. With the help of my SIL we did all the planning nothing would happen without us. Now if I leave that all falls on my SIL she also loses her extra support since if I was aviabile I would pick the kids up and stuff and we would hangout with mom if she had something else to take care of.  I acknowledge my brother's job is demanding and did not think of all the logistics properly. Still thinking about it but I properly will turn down said opportunity to keep the status quo. Me leaving does not just impact my mom it would impact everyone. I know my niece and nephew would miss mom greatly. I mean when we went to see Mufasa they were fighting to sit next to her because my mom needs to sit on the corner near aisle.  I still have a week to sign the contract, but yeah opportunities come and go but time with family is limited. ",

        "selftext": "I went to my brother\u2019s house yesterday to visit his 3 kids and pregnant wife. He was not home. The children are hellions, but I try to treat them as nice as I can which is hard. They don\u2019t get out much, only to go to school, so I told them to pick something to make and we will go to the store and get the ingredients. They chose candied grapes. Everytime I take them to the store, I have to preface our visit with rules as to what not to do in the store. No running, no asking for anything that\u2019s not on the list, no playing, no wandering off. As soon as we get in the store, I put the youngest(4) in the cart and the oldest (12) promised that she could push the cart with no issues so I let her. The middle child (11) immediately began asking for stuff and tried wandering off. The oldest kept crashing into stuff and knocking things over and the youngest was screaming at the top of his lungs. We checked out and the cashier gave the youngest a coloring sheet and some crayons. We walked to the car and I watched all of them get in the car.  When we got back to the house, I helped the youngest out of the car and realized that either him or the middle child had colored all over my car seats. I asked the youngest if he did it and he said no, and I told him I think he did and he kicked me. I took them inside and told my sister in law (who is sitting in the garage smoking a black & mild) what happened. She did nothing.  The next day, I was going to the car wash and discovered crayon marks all over the rear passenger side door that the kids were using to get in and out the day before. Yellow and blue crayon marks all over the door. The crayon marks had been pressed in so hard on the door that there were scratches underneath and I couldn\u2019t get the crayon or scratches off.  I took pics and sent them to my brother and his wife telling them that they need to pay for this and that his kids have no home training. I told him they don\u2019t watch them and just sit in the garage smoking and drinking all day while the kids run wild. I told them how I\u2019m always trying to do something nice for the children and they don\u2019t respect me or my stuff ever. My brother told me it was probably an accident and was very defensive. I took my car to get repaired which was $300 and told him to pay it. He said kids are kids and said that if it bothers me so much, I don\u2019t need to do anything for them. I told him he needs to take accountability and he said just don\u2019t do anything for them. Once he sent the money, I hung up on him. I wish I could show you all the outside of the door.  AITA for being upset with him and his wife for being bad parents and telling him his kids have no home training?  EDIT: when we all got out of the car at the house, the only crayon marking I saw was on the seats which I knew I could get out myself so I wasn\u2019t bothered too much. I don\u2019t know when any of the kids could have drawn on the outside of the door as I was watching them whenever they were outside the car. I think the middle child snuck out and did it after I told him I wouldn\u2019t buy him anymore candy for the grapes. ",

        "selftext": "I'm gonna try to keep this as short and sweet as I can because I just need to know if I really fucked up. For backstory, I, (21F) have a best friend Ali (21F), and we've been best friends since ninth grade. We're complete open books with each other, and we've, until now, never judged. I always wanted her to feel safe to talk to me about anything, and I hoped she felt the same about me. We both go to the same uni and room together. So, around eight almost nine months ago (we had been friends since I started uni), I got together with my girlfriend Freddie (22F), and she's been my first love. It's been so incredible being with her, she is such an angel that just gets me on every single level. Biiiig oversharing time, but losing my virginity has always been something that really scared me, in the sense of trusting someone with my body like that. No trauma or anything, just scared, but I finally got there with Freddie a few nights ago. She was so loving and after we were done I just cried out happy tears. I was so just ecstatic that I got to do that with someone I love so much, and Freddie just hugged me tight and was so kind about it. I told Ali about this the day after and since them she keeps making jokes about me being a big big cry baby and will just mock cry at me randomly when we see each other. I just rolled my eyes at her and tried to just bear it, because no way was I letting her ruin that experience for me. Last night we were at a party together and she absolutely crossed the line. First, she was just making wah wah noises at me, but then she made a gross joke about Freddie having a 'thing' for crying. I just yelled at her to shut up because I'm so fucking sick of it. It's just not funny. She looked all shocked and I just called Freddie and asked her to pick me up. I've been at her apartment off-campus since, and Ali and some of our friends that witnessed it are getting upset with me and telling me to stop being so sensitive. I haven't answered any texts yet, and Freddie's telling me I did nothing wrong with removing myself from the situation, but I'm still so conflicted. \u2014\u2014\u2014UPDATE Um so the AITA mods wouldnt let me post the update as a stand alone so I\u2019m just gonna paste it here LMFAO.  I'm not sure if anyone cares for an update but I'm gonna post one anyways LOL! I got much good advice on my last post, but against what multiple people were saying, I decided to talk to Ali. We've been friends for long, and frankly, this is real life. I'm not gonna cut her off without even speaking to her first. Also, shoutout to the person who said crying after sex was a sapphic rite of passion, my girlfriend thinks you're hilarious!! Anyways, I messaged Ali and told her to meet me at the late night coffee shop we frequent, and she answered yes. I asked Freddie if she could wait outside in the car for me in case things go south, which she said of course to. I was nervous, and Ali was already there by the time we pulled up. She looked nervous too, but also somehow pissed off?? I sat down and she immediately asked me what the hell was wrong with me completely icing her out like that. I kept myself calm then, despite my rising anger. I told her how insane it was that she thinks she's the victim here, she taunted me for days over something she knew what really important to me, and then at the crest of it all she made a downright disgusting joke about my girlfriend. I told her if she didn't explain exactly why she thought any of that was remotely okay, there was zero chance of us ever being friends again. She shut her mouth fast, and looked kind of conflicted before she just blurted out some actual Wattpad shit I'd read when I was thirteen, I'm just pissed off because it should've been me making you cry like that. Uhhhh?? She pretty much just word vomited about how jealous she is of Freddie and that she's liked me since grade 12, when I got hot (UH?). Safe to say, I don't think I've ever been angrier. I can't remember well what I said, I was just\u00a0*so angry.*\u00a0I told her something about how bizarre she sounds, that I can't believe she would never tell me and just be a total bitch. I got too loud when telling her I was switching dorms, when an employee asked me to leave. Ali tried to follow me out but I told her to fuck off and drove away with a very concerned Freddie. I blocked her on our way home. I told our friends that witnessed the party, and also the ones who weren't there (just in case they were told something) the real story, and they all apologized to me. To be fair, they were all pretty wasted at the time of the incident, and probably didn't really realize exactly what was going on. They agreed to cut Ali out of the group, and that's just where we are now. I'm keeping the ones who berated me at arms length, just for my own sanity right now. Ali's tried to approach me a few times, but it's when I've been with people who know, so they helped me get rid of her quick. I'm still very hurt and weirded out, but I luckily have Freddie and good friends to keep me upright. Anyways, thank you so much for all the support on the last post, and have a good night!",

        "selftext": "My (35F) little sister (31F) gave birth to her second child late Dec '24. She asked me to be her 2nd birth partner to support her and her husband and I was stoked to agree. Mom thought it was great too. Some background on my parents (65F, 71M). Mom loves to play the victim. We used to be close, but I don't like playing her therapist anymore. My dad was a workaholic with zero emotional regulation and quick to anger.  Jump to Dec. It was the most amazing and emotional experience to help my sis and she has a calm, natural birth. They made baby's middle name my first name, total honour. I tried leaving to avoid overstaying but my sister wanted me to stay at the hospital overnight to help her while her husband went back home to their toddler, so I did. It was super special caring for her.  In the lead up my sis told my parents she's not sure if she wants them visiting the hospital or when they first get home. She also sets the don't come if you're sick and no kissing baby rule. They're miffed. Next morning Mom messages me and invites her and dad to have a coffee at the hospital. I say I'll come to our family home but she says no because they are in the middle of packing to move to their property 3 hrs away. When we meet, my dad is coughing/sick and he goes so we are going up to meet the baby now? I say no that's not the plan and you can't meet baby if you are sick. Dad starts yelling in the middle of the hospital cafe saying yes he can because baby already has an immunity from my sister and heaps of babies are born in disgusting conditions around the world. He then accuses me of subterfuge for being at the birth. He won't stop yelling and demanding to go up to the ward. I tell him he doesn't have my sister's permission and she needs to know he's unwell. My Mom is all I told you not to say anything. Dad keeps escalating. I tell dad I'd rather he be NC with me than I go against my sister's boundaries when she's so vulnerable after birth. He carries on about my conniving subterfuge and manipulation I think for not saying I was at the birth. I then told Dad that my sister asked me 6 months ago, sis had told mom multiple times since and sis told Mom yesterday I was on my way. Dad looked confused and mum says \u201cI must have forgot\u201d. I went back to the ward without them, warned my sister, said goodbye and made a hasty exit to drive back home, crying the whole way. My sis ended up letting my parents come into the ward though Dad wasn't allowed near the baby...I then find out they drove back to their property the next day. so it was zero about supporting my sister and her husband. I haven't spoken to my parents since. AITA? tldr: I was my sister's birth partner, my boomer parents lost their shit and accused me of deceit and subterfuge.",

        "selftext": "I (28M) am from the Philippines and have been in a bit of a financial bind recently, trying to manage our family\u2019s finances as best I can. My wife (28F) and I have two kids\u2014a 7-year-old son and a daughter who will be turning 1 soon. I\u2019m the only one working, and I earn about $850 a month. After paying bills and groceries, money is tight. In January, I received a total of $828. I paid $234 in bills in total and gave my wife $144 to budget for the first two weeks. The rest, I kept as savings for our daughter\u2019s birthday, with the plan to add more in the upcoming paychecks. Unfortunately, we didn\u2019t manage the $144 well, and by the next paycheck, we were down to $54 in savings. On January 10th, I noticed my wife only had $28 left, and by the 12th, she was down to just $5. When I asked how that happened, she got upset but said not to worry because it was all spent on us. At this point, I had to dip into the savings I set aside for our daughter\u2019s birthday to cover expenses. Fast forward to later in the month, and I decided to take control of the finances for the next paycheck. I told my wife I would be handling the money for the next two paychecks so I could keep track of everything. I told her she could still take money from my wallet, but she would have to let me know how much and what it was for. She got upset, saying I don\u2019t trust her and that I was being selfish. A few days later, I discovered she was planning to pawn her necklace to help her sister pay off her debt. I tried to open up a conversation by asking about her sister\u2019s situation, hoping she would tell me about the necklace. Eventually, I directly asked if she planned to pawn it to help her sister, and she admitted it. I told her I was against it because we were already in a tough spot financially, and we needed the necklace for our daughter\u2019s birthday. That led to an argument, and she said she\u2019d rather not celebrate our daughter\u2019s birthday than not help her sister. I tried to explain that it\u2019s okay to help others, but it can\u2019t come at the cost of our own financial stability. She became really angry and said she wasn\u2019t willing to understand or give me a chance to explain. She accused me of not trusting her and being selfish, and we\u2019ve been at odds since then. On top of all this, she\u2019s been acting childish in this situation. She insists on not touching our shared money, which we are supposed to spend as part of our budget, but then complains about having it difficult. When I called her out on this behavior, I made it very clear that she needs to grow up and be more responsible. I\u2019ve been feeling hurt because I feel like I made my plans clear and that I\u2019m just trying to keep us financially stable. AITA for being strict about managing our money and not allowing my wife to pawn the necklace to help her sister?",

        "selftext": "English is my(17m) second language so sorry in advance. It\u2019s a bit messy(both my English and what happened).  I had a crush on my friend \u2018Pam\u2019(17f) for some time now. Always figured that if I confessed, the worst that could happen is a rejection. I did not even get a chance to confess. My other friend decided to tell her on my behalf, something she did without consulting me, mind you. And it turns out Pam thought I was gay, because I watch Bridgerton and enjoy it enough to buy all the books. Said \u2018the only reason to watch the show is to check out the Duke and the Viscount.\u2019 As if my crush thinking I\u2019m gay isn\u2019t bad enough, she also told a few of our mutual friends that I\u2019m gay. Friends who frequently engage in gossip. I\u2019ve already had to deal with two false rumors about myself at school : that my dad took part in a deeply unpopular coup d\u2019etat and that I\u2019m Cambodian because of my dark skin. Took months to convince people my dad was already discharged before the coup, and some of my classmates still question my ethnicity. Unlike most people here in my country, I do not hate Cambodians, but I do not want to be mistaken for one either, just out of desire to avoid harassment.  She knew about those rumors and how they affected me. So I snapped at the prospect of a potential third rumor. Nothing against gay people; I just don\u2019t want to deal with anymore crap. Just want a peaceful final year of high school before heading off to university. I asked her \u2018Did it ever occur to you that I might have been checking out Daphne and Kate? Or did you forget to use your brain to think?\u2019 Pam said there was no need to be so rude and hostile, and that it was simply a mistake.",

        "selftext": "EDIT : I did tell my mom to stop. I wrote the title incorrectly by accidentally adding \u2018not\u2019 in there. Okay, so my sister (18F) recently introduced to us (my dad, mom, and me) her boyfriend (I think 18 too or 19) who surprised me because her boyfriend was someone that I knew at school (older than me) and kinda close with after being partnered with him for an event. Anyways, I noticed my mom seemed a bit disappointed when my sister introduced her partner, and I later asked her when they left to go somewhere. My mom then explained that she thought my sister would get together with her friend\u2019s son\u2014let\u2019s call him \u2018Jake,\u2019 obviously false but just for more clarity\u2014which I was just confused about, frankly, because that said son already had a girlfriend. Though my mom reasoned that it wasn\u2019t like they were married yet, and considering how my sister and Jake had always known each other from childhood and whatnot.  I got really annoyed at this because my mom also tried to pair me up with another friend\u2019s son, but he and I mutually agreed we had no interest in each other. Anyways, back to what happened, I told my mom that she really should just let my sister be since she\u2019s old enough to do what is right and knows what she deserves.  Mom seemed upset with my words and told me that she was only thinking of the best for my sister, but I told her that she should stop trying to interfere with my sister\u2019s choices and that what my sister did was her choice. She seemed dissatisfied with my words and stormed off, and I heard her complain to my dad that I was becoming unruly, but it seemed like my dad agreed with me because a few hours after that, he gave me a thumbs up.  And while I do have some bias with my sister because she\u2019s the best, I think that her boyfriend seemed pretty good, plus, from my experience with him, he was really respectful and never overstepped boundaries. So, am I in the wrong for what I said?",

        "selftext": "Throwaway account. My house is for sale. It\u2019s being sold due to my marriage unexpectedly breaking down after I found out my husband - \u201cAdam\u201d - had been having a year long affair and when caught, moved out. Adam has been a real POS in the aftermath - very justified, hostile and mean. It\u2019s been awful. Did I mention we have two kids? They are 3 and 1. I was pregnant the entire time he cheated.  I digress. The house is in my name and is operating under a private sale. And right now there are a few parties competing for it. I\u2019ll sell it in the next 72 hours to clear our debts.  Here\u2019s the kicker: his best friend (his best man) and his wife want to buy it. But they didn\u2019t tell me. They had the estate agent tell me. These are people who i have called friends for a long time, but when this affair broke out, they were sympathetic but then vanished in the last 6 months. Ghosted me and the children - would be cordial when I ran into them, and I would be too - but other than that, no support. Now they are in a tight race with others to buy it and I find the entire scenario weird and deeply awkward. Why wouldn\u2019t they just call and tell me beforehand?! Why get the agent to tell me? There\u2019s better ways to go about this. They aren\u2019t bad people. Just awkward.This is so shitty and emotional. But on a logical front, sell this damn house. So the offers are coming in and they\u2019re getting pretty tight money wise and similar in terms. I told the agent that someone needs to differentiate and make a bigger offer so that I\u2019m not splitting hairs. I am reluctant to sell to them as it\u2019s so weird and awkward. I feel like they\u2019re dancing on the grave a bit. I really want these other bidders I don\u2019t know to get it because I don\u2019t want to make a decision. I don\u2019t really see these friends anymore - my husband does - and I can see it for what it is, despite it being really disappointing by them.  Would I be the asshole if I went with these other people if the offers and terms were practically the same?  Edit: edited for paragraph breaks! Update (if interested) For those who commented or upvoted my post, thank you for your supportive comments and advice. I got a high offer, it's close to $3m, and it's from my ex's best friend and his wife. Fine. Obviously awkward and uncomfortable as hell, but fine, that's an incredible price and more money than I dreamed of this house fetching. It clears our mortgages and there's cash leftover. The other buyers walk. I tell the agent: yes - sold. Let me know when the signed contracts come through.But... I don't get a contract. The agent and I are on the phone all the time. He is communicating with me around the clock and it is reassuring. But I tell him I have a bad feeling, why don't I have a contract? He tells me that it's all in hand, they are finalising some smaller details, it will come through shortly.And that's when the calls and messages start. The husband - let's call him Paul - is trying to reach out. He wants to speak. I avoid his calls and tell him I'm busy with the kids, any q's regarding the sale direct through to agent, l'm ready to sign. Paul says, no concerns commercially, we want to check if you're ok, call me. My agent says - you're right to have a bad feeling, they won't sign until you say you are ok with this sale. He says in 20 years of real estate he's never heard of such a thing. I tell the agent this is emotional blackmall. He says he has tried everything to convince them but they insist on me saying it's ok. I feel shaky and sick. It's at this point that I very much can see that they are having a crisis of conscience. They have suddenly realised the optics aren't  great around this. They know that this will invite a lot of judgement... and when it comes they need to have some good 'spin' on it. I can picture them saying, how did she [me] feel about it? She was fine - she was just so relieved that another family was moving into it. Naturally we checked on her!. I find all of this so gross. So l'm over a barrel. I'm about to lose $3m if I don't tell them what they want to hear. It's too risky to call their bluff. I can't believe they let it get to this point and then throw this emotional condition into a commercial transaction. So I tell them what they want to hear only via text - so l don't have to speak to them. This forced message apologises that I have been avoiding their calls as l've been overwhelmed with selling the house and I'm cool with it. I feel... grubby. I don't lie, I really don't. But this is for my children. I send the text and within an hour my inbox gets the contract. I sign it. I receive a text from each of them thanking me and that my children and I are important to them and they would never have signed unless I was ok with it. Now I am waiting for the cooling off period to pass. Settlement isn't for 4 months. If they bail between now and then, and of course they could, they would forfeit their $500k deposit. ",

        "selftext": "Okay so I (29M) started college when I was 17. Because of my family\u2019s income and general status I was not granted much financial aid for college. Because I have 2 younger siblings, and my parents had other financial responsibilities, my parents could not afford to pay out-of-pocket for my undergrad and I was not granted nearly enough in personal loans. The school my parents and I agreed on is a private university, and tuition was high.  Because of the cost of the college, personal loans were taken out in my name, and my parents took out Parent Plus Loans in their name. Now I work full-time and my loans are on an income-driven repayment plan. I am easily able to manage my monthly payments on those (the ones in my name). However, my issue is that my parents are demanding monthly payments for the ParentPlus Loans taken out in their names. Their stance is that the loans were taken out for me and my education, so I am responsible for repaying them. The ParentPlus Loans cannot be transferred to me, and the payments are literally half of my income each month, because the lowest payment option is based on THEIR income, which is significantly higher than mine.  I have been paying them monthly for a year, and this has forced me to live paycheck to paycheck, unable to save for a car or house. I can\u2019t start a family, and I can\u2019t progress financially in any way due to immediately having to spend every dollar I earn on those payments plus rent/bills/insurance/groceries/therapy/etc\u2026 The ParentPlus Loans are currently in forbearance (since October) until April. This past week I told my parents I will not be resuming payments on them due to 1) Its not my loan. 2) We (Americans) are about to get hit with a recession/depression. 3) I cannot advance in any way making these payments. My mother has responded saying that\u2019s not an option because their retirement and/or credit will be ruined by this choice, and that I will owe them the money. AITA for wanting to stop these payments?  TLDR; My parents took out a loan for me to go to college, but the loan was in their name. They now expect me to pay them back for it, but I can\u2019t afford it. AITA for discontinuing payments so I can afford to live somewhat comfortably?  Edit 1 (More Info): There was no clear communication about repayment discussed when the loans were taken out. My mom took control of financial planning of my college, and I was very passive in the process, unaware any loans were taken out in their name until payments started being due. If they were my personal loans, they would be payed based on my current income. Edit 2 (More Info): My parents didn\u2019t force me to go to a specific school, but also I wasn\u2019t really provided choices. When I graduated high school, the discussion was basically \u201cSo you\u2019re going here, right? Because that\u2019s the best option.\u201d and there wasn\u2019t more debate or discussion on it. I liked the school. My parents liked the school. I didn\u2019t really take ownership of that decision or fight it because my mom took charge of college stuff for me.  Edit 3 (More Info): My parents knew what types of loans were being taken out. They both work in banking/finance, and know how money/loans work. And again, my mom took full accountability/ownership for the financial planning of my college.  Edit 4 (Wording): I have no stopped the payments yet. Adjusted wording to reflect that I want to stop making them. The loans are currently in forbearance. There was no sudden stop of payments to my parents. Edit 5 (Idek): People seem to think I\u2019m set on my opinion. I\u2019m here to listen, learn, and grow. I\u2019m not trying to screw over my parents, and I\u2019m not accusing my parents of being malicious. I\u2019m trying to come up with solutions that my parents and I can use as a team to combat this. And I want to hear all perspectives on the situation. Attacking me by saying I hate my parents or vice versa is simply not true, and not helpful. Edit 6: Because people are still attacking me for being \u201cselfish\u201d or \u201chating my parents\u201d I need to be VERY clear that I am here, again, to listen and learn. You are able to communicate your perspectives respectfully. I don\u2019t hate my parents, nor do they hate me. I\u2019m not set on any plan other than working as a team with my parents to combat this. No one is cutting anyone off unless this escalates wildly and unexpectedly. Yall need to chill on the personal attacks. I can be in the wrong about something without being villainized. If I\u2019m in the wrong, just point it out and explain why. No need to attack me beyond that. Final Edit: Leaning ESH on my own post. Thanks to everyone who has been kind and given me insight, advice, support, and reassurance. My mom and I are working towards coming up with a plan so neither me nor my parents will be screwed over by this. People who kindly and respectfully disagreed with me, you are appreciated. This issue is no longer Me vs My Parents. It\u2019s now Me & My Parents vs The Problem. Thanks all except those menaces who for some reason think I should hate my parents or vice versa. \u2665\ufe0f\ud83d\udd7a\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udd25 ",

        "selftext": "I (17M) live with my mum (49f) my dad (50m) my grandma (79f) and little sis (14f). Since my mum and dad work all day grandma has decided to do the chores while me and my sis are at school. This has been going on for years. Last couple of months I've noticed she's getting a bit tired so I finish chores after school so she can sleep a bit. That fatigue is often shown in various arguments with my mum. Grandma often takes advice from her sister (83F) who has 2 daughters let's call them Jenny (53f) and Megan (46f) which tells her to dump as and leave for the village to live with her and her daughters. My dad always says that grandma's sister and her daughters are the worst part of our family tree and honestly I agree they are spoiled and really bad people that have done some immoral things to other members of their family. During a family table my grandma moaned a bit about having to cook all alone when mum had her day off and was sleeping until noon. Then her sister said I told you to leave those ungrateful bastards they don't appreciate what you've done for them unilke my daughters who are an example of children raised right in this moment I couldn't hold my anger I stood up looked her dead in the eye and told her Are you really saying this? For your information we are all grateful of her presence not only because she does the chores but because she grew up my mum, me and my sibling with values and morals unlike you and your daughters. Have you wondered why Jenny got divorced twice or why Megan cant even find a job. You didn't do as good of a job as you think raising your daughters. You have no right to call us like that in our house in our table. Dad told me to go to my room so i left. I overheard my grandma's sister saying I wasn't raised right but my parents defended me. After she left dad said I was right and apologized for not interrupting earlier while mum said I shouldn't have done this. I do think i did the right thing defending my family and putting her in her place. What do yall think?",

He comes over every weekend so my mom and I can care for the baby on Sunday and Monday nights. They leave for work at 3:00 a.m. and leave the baby with me until my mom gets home at 8:00 a.m. Then my mom takes over until they get back from work at 2:00 p.m. My mom works 12-hour night shifts. I do this once or twice a week, depending on my mom's schedule. Mind you, I did not sign up for this. They pretty much said, She's not doing anything anyway, so she can take care of the baby while my mom gets home. I'm currently not working, hence why I'm home and living off savings. I also have had health issues since November. I will be having surgery soon. This is another issue. I clearly told my mom that I did not want people coming in and out of our house because if I get sick, my surgery will be canceled. She does not care, and my brother and his girlfriend were sick last week, coughing and sneezing all over the house. Now, this weekend, the baby has started to get sick. I just texted them that one of them will have to call off work to take care of the baby because what if she gets worse? I know for a fact that they are still going to leave her and my brother is going to get pissed and start with the name calling.  You're a selfish *****, she's your niece. That's the reason things happen to you because you're a ***** and hypochondriac. You're weak minded.When I wanted to go to the ER for my pelvic pain nobody wanted to take me. I had to call my bf. He had to get out of work and come get me. I feel like I'm always helping out my family one way or another, but when I need a favor, it's crickets. ",

        "selftext": " I (20F) have chronic neck pain and a diagnosed panic disorder. As part of my pain management and coping skills, I lay down in the bathtub and use the showerhead against my chest. This is relevant because it helps with both my pain and panic attacks. Additionally, I'm currently sick, and showering has been helping with that too. Tonight, I took a shower around 11 PM. Suddenly, I heard a knock on the bathroom door, and my roommate's (28F) boyfriend (29M) started yelling at me. He demanded to know what I was doing, called me horrible for taking a shower at 11 PM, and accused me of waking him up. This was especially upsetting because he knows about my pain and panic disorder. When I got out of the shower, he started the argument again. He brought up that we\u2019re supposed to be quiet after 10 PM (something discussed during a house meeting) as his justification. However, during that meeting, I specifically stated that I might need to take showers after 10 PM due to my health issues, and everyone\u2014including him\u2014agreed. He dismissed this, accusing me of lying, because it wasn\u2019t explicitly written in the house rules.  Throughout the argument, he kept interrupting me and became upset when I interrupted him once. Eventually, I lost patience and told him to shut up. At that point, he began mocking me, making fun of my dyslexia by calling me a retard and saying I probably can't read, which is why I\u2019m breaking the rules. He also accused me of lying again, claiming I wasn\u2019t taking a shower but actually taking a bath. He insisted he could hear me lying in the tub. I tried explaining how I shower, but he interrupted me again. (Why does this matter to him????) The argument became very heated. He accused me of bothering him with my problems and said that other people in the house need to sleep because some people need to go to school or work tomorrow. This was a clear jab at me since I\u2019m not currently working or in school due to my poor mental health following a traumatic event.  None of my actual roommates have ever complained about my late showers. In fact, they\u2019ve encouraged it because they understand how severe my pain and panic attacks can be.  So, AITA?

        "selftext": "**A little general background:** I'm a first-year law student. In my country, after high school, you typically attend law school for a five-year degree, take the bar exams, and then begin practising law. My college has given us an internship break until February, so I'm currently interning for two months. I (F17) have been interning with a firm since December. A new intern (F20-22) joined in January. For context, we've had minor arguments since her first day, when she made a comment about my financial background, implying I don't need to work because I must have daddy's money lying around, since my particular law school is quite expensive. Over the past few days, she has been taking off her shoes while working. Since we share the same table, the smell becomes unbearable. (She wears shoes without socks, and with the building's elevator out of order, we\u2019ve been climbing five flights of stairs daily in 31\u00b0C/87.8\u00b0F weather.) I\u2019ve been addressing this issue privately for a few days now\u2014starting with subtle hints and eventually directly asking her to keep her shoes on. Today, the same issue arose, but this time, I confronted her in front of other coworkers (who happened to be her juniors from the same college). The conversation unfolded as follows: **Me:** Hey [name], I hope this doesn\u2019t come across the wrong way, but I\u2019ve noticed you sometimes take off your shoes in the office. I understand wanting to be comfortable, but since this is a shared space, it might be better to keep them on to maintain a professional atmosphere. I hope you don\u2019t mind me bringing this up again. **Her:** Why does it matter to you? You already said the same thing the other day. **Me:** It\u2019s just a bit uncomfortable to see your feet while working (we have glass tables). **Her:** Then don\u2019t look. **Me:** You\u2019ve also been kicking me under the table, which is really uncomfortable. Could you please stop? **Her:** No, I\u2019m wearing heels, and they\u2019re uncomfortable to wear all day. I\u2019ll continue to take them off. **Me:** I get that heels can be uncomfortable, and I understand wanting to be at ease. Maybe you could try wearing sports shoes or office shoes like the rest of us? It must also be tough to climb the stairs in heels. But could you please keep your shoes on? The smell can get a bit overwhelming. **Her:** No. I would know if my feet smelled. **Another coworker (to me):** Show her some respect. She\u2019s three years older than you, *bitch.*   So Reddit, AITA for asking my coworker to wear her shoes because I don't want\u00a0to\u00a0see\u00a0her\u00a0feet?",

        "selftext": "This happened on the morning of December 31. Here's some backstory: I have an ex-friend who stopped being part of our friend group around 2020 or 2021 (I don\u2019t remember exactly). She blocked all of us because of her toxic boyfriend/baby daddy, who didn\u2019t like us. He claimed we were causing their fights by pointing out issues like her being seen with another guy and other cheating problems. A few months later, she unblocked us and added us back on Facebook. I accepted her request but didn\u2019t talk to her anymore. Eventually, I unfriended her because of all the negativity and toxic posts she kept sharing about her baby daddy. After almost four years of no contact, I was shocked when she messaged me at midnight on Christmas, asking if she could celebrate with us. I didn\u2019t respond because I didn\u2019t want to entertain her message and accept her message request. Then on December 31, after a week of long hours at work, I was surprised to see her son and his grandmother in our living room. In our culture, when your godchild comes to greet you during Christmas or days after Christmas you\u2019re expected to give them a gift or money. Her son is around 4 or 5 years old (I can\u2019t remember exactly). To say I was shocked and annoyed would be an understatement. I mean, seriously? My ex-friend, who I haven\u2019t spoken to in years, sent her son and mother to my house. I was upset and just nodded at the child. I heard my mom telling the grandmother, \u201cShe\u2019s not in the mood,\u201d and they left. Later, my family told me I was being cruel and cold, and that I shouldn\u2019t let my anger at the mother affect the child. They said I should\u2019ve just given money. I told them I wasn\u2019t obligated to do so. Now, I\u2019m wondering, was I wrong in this situation? Was I the asshole?",

Not to be rude and turn them away, we invite them in each time and each visitor has seen weve been eating dinner and not acknowledged it. (If it was me, id insist on leaving and calling back). But they didnt seem to have a problem. Each time Ive continued to eat my dinner while chatting to her family, my wife doesnt and waits until theyve left.  We got into an argument the other day about it  and she thinks im incredibly rude by continuing to eat while her parents/sister have been in the house. My point is, when they arrive they clearly see were in the middle of eating and dont suggest calling back another time, so why should I have to stop eating and be inconvenienced? I just dont get how Im the rude person in this situation, I definitely feel its her family!  Am I just a greedy, hungry, impatient asshole? \ud83e\udd23",

        "selftext": "AITA  AITAH for blowing up at my sister for being manipulative and targeting my wife? I (f26) grew up in state care and met my sister (f29) at 12. We were close, and I'm the godmother to her kids (f9 & f8). For years, I babysat often, sometimes for days or weekends while I was homeless and struggling with mental health. This continued for years. About three years ago, I met my now-wife (f29) and got a job I love. Initially, my sister was happy for me, but soon began complaining I wasn't around as much. I explained that while I loved her and the kids, I had to focus on my happiness. I still saw the kids lots, just not as often. After my wife and I married, things worsened. My sister started accusing me of being abused by my wife because I couldn\u2019t do everything for her anymore. She kept insisting that her kids and her should always come before my wife. She would demand things from us late at night, like chocolate or coffee, even when we were busy. When we didn't drop everything, she\u2019d get upset. Things escalated when she started telling us her husband was abusing her, but then told us not to tell anyone. She also shared inappropriate family gossip, which was triggering for me given my own childhood trauma. Last July, I was hospitalized for a serious illness. During this time, my sister repeatedly accused my wife of being abusive and criticized us for not spending enough time with her kids, even though I was in the hospital. She even said my wife was selfish for not picking up my sister's kids while I was sick. In November, my sister told my wife she wasn't welcome at family events and tried to plan a vacation without her. I tried to talk to her about it, but she mocked my concerns, laughed and dismissed my feelings, saying I was just letting my wife abuse me.I finally lost it, mentioning how unfair it was for my wife to be treated this way, especially when she behaved the way she did, including supporting her supposed abuser. My sister then texted that she wanted nothing to do with me and I was no longer welcome around her kids. This is where I might be the AH, I phoned our eldest sister, distraught. I told her EVERYTHING. Which of course my sister denied.  Afterward, her husband messaged the family group, calling me and my wife vile and accusing us of making up lies about his wife. They then removed us. They also took our holiday money (nearly $1000) and have been bad-mouthing us ever since. So, AITAH for blowing up at her? ",

        "selftext": "Throwaway. My ex-boyfriend and I had been dating for six years and living together for 3. l've been unhappy in our relationship for the past few months and finally decided it was time to break up with him. I broke up with him last week, and it's been extremely painful ever since. There have been a lot of tears and conversations, and trying to navigate moving out on top of everything has been hell. For context, I love my ex very much, but I felt breaking up was my only choice if I wanted to be happy as things were not getting better. On to the story! One of my friends had a bridal shower this weekend, and I could not be more excited for her. My ex-boyfriend and I have been good friends with this person and their fianc\u00e9 \u2014 we have even gone on vacations together. My friend is aware of my break-up and has seen first hand how much I have agonized over this decision. When I arrived at her bridal shower yesterday and started greeting other guests, I quickly realized that somehow everyone in the room already knew about my breakup. Throughout the night, I was approached by multiple people, even ones I barely know, who offered their condolences, told me they were proud of me, asked how my apartment search was going, and prompted me for details about my breakup and impending move. The MOH even pushed for details multiple times in front of the bride\u2019s family, even though I was very clearly trying to navigate away from the subject. The whole night felt like one of those scenes in high school when you walk into a room and notice people looking at you as if they've just been whispering about you. I played it off as best I could and tried to change the subject whenever possible. Apart from that, I would say the evening went fine and everyone had a lovely time celebrating the bride. However, since getting home yesterday, I can't help but feel really betrayed. It feels like my friend used my painful breakup as gossip and shared it with a lot of people who shouldn't know my personal business, especially since I'm not close with them in any way. Both my ex and I are real people with real feelings and our pain shouldn\u2019t be used as party gossip. I've also started receiving texts from people who attended the party, informing me that they've heard what happened and asking how I'm doing. While I understand their intentions are positive, this feels very invasive. These are her friends, not mine. I would have understood her sharing this with her partner or even a close mutual friend of ours, but this was much bigger than that. I texted her today and told her I could no longer be her bridesmaid or friend. Both her and the MOH think I overreacted. Now I\u2019m second guessing my decision and worried I was too rash \u2014 I just simply can\u2019t imagine treating a friend this way when they feel so vulnerable. Am I the asshole?",

        "selftext": "We like to do a few short trips during school holidays instead of a big vacation once a year. SIL and MIL tagged along once on such a trip (1 week, sunny destination, 2 hours flight). Sister-in-law is now pissed because we booked a new trip without her, according to her she also needs a vacation and we knew that. The problem is, going on vacation together was fun, but more difficult than when I go on vacation with just my wife and daughter (3f). They do not take into account the fact that a child is on vacation with us. We arrange everything in terms of accommodation/activities so that we as parents have a nice vacation, but it is also fun for our daughter. Some extra planning and a certain structure in advance makes for an easier vacation with a child. First SIL tried to manipulate or guilt trip our daughter (don't know the right word) to be allowed to go on vacation with us. \u201cWhy can\u2019t I go on holiday with you\u201d, \u201cAuntie would also like to fly again\u201d, \u201cAuntie thinks it\u2019s sad that she can\u2019t go with you\u201d are just a few comments that I heard her say to our daughter. I explicitly told her that she shouldn\u2019t do that to a child and that it is also very hurtful for us and her. SIL\u2019s next idea blew me away: She suggested to a 3-year-old to go on holiday with her and the grandmother (SIL and MIL) without us. Who tells or suggests something like that to a child? I hate being cornered like that, as parents we have to disappoint our child because SIL doesn\u2019t have the sense to keep her mouth shut.. Those people are also not suited to go on holiday alone with a child because they only think of themselves. Last time (daughter was 2) they were already nagging about the following things: Didn\u2019t want to go to lunch at 12.00 because they weren\u2019t hungry, didn\u2019t listen to the fact that daughter was hungry. Complaining because we didn't want to go to an evening market at 20.00 and we were already putting our daughter to bed. Didn't want to play in the pool because splashing water was too cold. Etc. They claim that we as parents would then also have a week of rest, but I think the opposite would be true. We would be exhausted from the stress for a week and wouldn't sleep. I don't like that idea, my wife doesn't like that idea, but my SIL and MIL are making us feel guilty to do it anyway. I don't know what to say anymore. AITA not to let our daughter go?",

We talked about the dates, accommodations and everything we needed for this wedding. I discovered that I could not afford to travel for this wedding I told her that I didn't have the money to travel to Italy and she immediately began screaming at me, telling me You agreed to be a part of this wedding so figure it out I explained to her that when we talked about her wedding before she got engaged it was going to be a small wedding in our hometown, now it has turned into something bigger that I just can't afford. She then told me Work more hours or even move back in with your parents so you don't have to pay rent and make it to this wedding. You already agreed to be in this wedding, you can't back out. All my other bridesmaids are coming so why can't you? I felt horrible for it but I told her I had to drop out of being in her wedding as it was expensive to travel, find accommodations, pay for my dress. All of it added up was too much for my budget. She hung up on me and about 10 minutes later her fianc\u00e9 called me and asked me why I was being a horrible friend.

When I discovered the circumstances and amount of the money left, it was obvious my sister (the executor, the POA and caretaker) hid this from us and that it would\u2019ve been a life changing amount of money for each of the beneficiaries on my mother\u2019s will, which states equal splits. We are going to confront her about this and give her the opportunity to fess up and make right to each sibling with the remaining amount and not even be penalized for what she\u2019s spent, so long as she\u2019s compliant and upfront. Honestly I just feel like an asshole wishing there was another way to handle it and fearing she will always resent me for outting this secret. AITA for not giving her a chance to fix it before sharing info with my siblings, even though shes already lied so many times about it and I didn\u2019t feel she\u2019d admit it in this approach? UPDATE: Thanks to everyone who responded. I appreciate the help getting in the right headspace about this. I finally have documented physical evidence now showing there is still quite a lot of $ left- just had to get on a plane and return to my mothers house to fortunately find a paper trail... Will update again. UPDATE: My siblings and I have developed how we want to approach this with her and the oldest is traveling into town as we speak so we are doing this in four hours. We have a lawyer on retainer. If she shows anything but full compliance, we will be forced to continue with legal action which includes removing her as executor and trying to validate the old will which divides the house four ways as well. I stayed up all night photographing documents proving her abuse of power of attorney, fraudulent actions and her self serving interests in hiding assets. She will be returning soon to my moms house (the house left to her in the possibly forged will but which is not in her name yet so she does not have possession of) which is when we will confront her\u2026  My sister has appeared kind and even \u201cgenerous\u201d at times to her friends and to her family. If there wasn\u2019t actual evidence proving these actions, no one that ever met her would believe she could be capable of this. UPDATE: After the initial shock of confrontation, my sister broke down in tears and spat out some swan song final lie about my mothers wishes being that she keep the money and keep it a secret. However she also said she never intended on allowing this money to not be split, but instead wanted to allow it to appreciate for a little longer to increase its total value before surprising us with our inheritance. Honestly, I know she\u2019s lying about that to save face/ maybe she believes that because it makes her feel better. It truly doesn\u2019t matter anymore why or what happened now that she is showing us account information and agreeing to the amounts she will begin transferring to each of us tomorrow after we ALL get to talk to her financial advisor. Legal action scared her and I\u2019m grateful these funds will be recovered. To the rest of it, let sleeping dogs lie. You may say I should still pursue legal recourse but since this money is all I wanted to recover, I don\u2019t care about anything else. I will absolutely keep updating on the progress. If anything goes wrong, legal recourse will be taken.P.S. of course she said she wishes I would\u2019ve come to her first as she obviously would\u2019ve cleared up the misunderstanding. As if.  UPDATE : My sister opened our conversation this morning with trying to get me on a flight home. She\u2019s completely changed her mind now and is pursing legal action. So are we. I\u2019m so angry right now. ",

        "selftext": "I bought my girlfriend an all expenses paid trip to Portugal for her birthday.  This included first class airfare, all tours, hotels, meals, rental car, train travel, etc. for two weeks.  This cost me over $12,000.  It cost her nothing except for personal items she decided to purchase on the trip.  A few months later, I rented an apartment in Lisbon for a month for my daughter and her friends so they could have a base from which to experience the country.  My girlfriend then complained to me that her birthday trip was not special because I did the same thing for my daughter, that I spoil my kids, and that she never wanted to go to Portugal in the first place.  She also told me that she had discussed all this with her friends and they agreed with her.  Am I really the asshole here?  ",

        "selftext": "Last winter (2023) my BFF (38F) had a scary incident with her then BF of several months on the way to a  shared office party. I (36F) started receiving messages from my BFF that said she was afraid to be in the car with her BF as he was freaking out while driving, yelling at her, etc. My wife (31F) and myself of course panicked and turned around to go get her. Luckily my BFF was not harmed, but it was not very clear as to what was actually happening, to be honest, it was just scary. She told him he had to leave by the time she was back from the party, which he did. After, I understood from my BFF that they had broken up and he had gone into outpatient therapy.  Fast forward about a year, my wife planned a surprise vacation for the both of us. My wife asked my BFF if she would be willing to stay at our house for the week that we would be gone in order to watch our animals. Note: my wife asked her before she booked anything. Shortly after asking, my BFF responded Hi girl, sure I can help out, what a sweet idea! After some messaging they agreed on the dates, with no issues brought up. Fast forward 1.5 weeks before we were to leave, my BFF is over and she asked us if her mom and niece could come over and hang out while she was watching our house. We said no problem! She then casually dropped that she and her (ex) BF had met up recently and were kind of dating. Wife and I were surprised, which we also gently made clear to her. She brushed off our concerns and didn't really engage. A few days afterwards, my BFF sent me a voice message asking if I would be okay with it if her BF stayed over at our home with her for a couple of days. I was shocked and upset. I got back to my her saying that while her family was totally fine, we were not comfortable with him being in our home while we were away. She defended him by saying he's totally fine now and what happened during the incident is unusual and not the norm. I said that's fine, but we had not seen him since then, and it felt strange to have him in our home when we thought he had been out of the picture for almost a year due to his actions. She pushed back by telling my wife that she hadn't even wanted to stay at our house, it was annoying and out of the way for her. My BFF then suggested that all four of us meet up for dinner before we leave on the trip, so that we can reconnect with her BF. We said we were happy to meet up, but that we would also look for another solution. She pressured us into letting her know asap. My wife and I were very lucky that her parents were in town visiting for several weeks, and they were happy to stay over at our house during our trip. We communicated this to my BFF and waited for an invite to meet her up with her and her BF. That never came - in fact, there was radio silence. I have since reached out to her to try to talk things out, but Reddit, AITA?",

        "selftext": "My(21m) mom asked me to talk to my aunt about something. She said my aunt\u2019s being scammed. Not a romance scam, though; she is convinced she\u2019s talking to her favorite author who needs someone to pay her bills for her while she works on a new book. Mom said that since my aunt has no children of her own and I\u2019m the closest thing she has to a son, she might listen to me. I dropped by. Asked how she\u2019s doing and then told her my mom told me about what\u2019s been going on. My aunt muttered something about \u2018meddling older sisters\u2019 before telling me she appreciates my concern but there\u2019s nothing to worry about. I told her that her favorite author sold more than 20 million copies in the US alone and had her works translated into more than 40 languages; she doesn\u2019t need anyone paying her bills for her. But my aunt wouldn\u2019t listen. I did not immediately give up. I told her I care about her and don\u2019t want to see her scammed but she insisted it\u2019s not a scam. She just made a lot of posts on social media about the books and the \u2018author\u2019 DM\u2019d her to ask for money. I told her that\u2019s exactly how these celebrity catfishes operate and even showed her the Catfishes channel on YouTube. She refused to watch any of the videos. After half an hour, I said \u2018Okay. I\u2019m going home now. See you later.\u2019 When my mom asked why I came home so early, I told her I love my aunt but don\u2019t know how I can convince someone who doesn\u2019t want to be convinced. She said I shouldn\u2019t give up so easily on someone I love. Small update : After reading some of the comments, I called my aunt and repeated the point about the number of books the author sold. She said the author told her she made bad investments. I told my aunt that even if that were the case, authors get advance fees so they won\u2019t starve while writing their books. Considering her favorite author has appeared on the New York Times Bestseller list several times, she can probably expect a sizable advance. Then I told my aunt that if she doesn\u2019t believe me because she still sees me as a kid, we can go to the bank and talk to the people there. Or the cops. I also told her that I can contact the author. I\u2019ve looked up her official website and Facebook. So I can message her in order to ask for direct confirmation. My aunt told me not to do anything yet and that she\u2019ll \u2019think about it.\u2019 I will talk to her again later. Just giving her time to think it out for now.",

        "selftext": "Writing the title makes me feel like I'm the asshole no matter what. But it's not exactly about the clothing. Let me describe my situation first. I (34M) met my wife (36F) 4 years ago. We got ~~engaged~~ married after 1 year together. We have a 2-year-old daughter. We\u2019re both working freelance, and her income is usually two or three times more than mine. We work equally in terms of time spent. When one person is working, the other takes care of the baby. As she earns more, she spends more. She treats herself and the family members (1 child and 2 cats) at her level of income. For example, we dine out a bit too much (I try to cook, not bad, but she usually doesn\u2019t feel like eating at home). She loves to buy expensive fruit over the affordable ones, or buy costly clothing, bags, or a top-of-the-line rice cooker. At the same time, she wants to feel equal in providing for the family. I try my best (I always sleep later and wake up earlier) to meet her expectations (and maybe haven't met them yet?), so I always run out of money every month. Every time I bring this into conversation, it\u2019s always \u201cI have the right to use my money.\u201d There's no way to get her to spend at the same rate as my income (which is above average in my city). -------- She used to work in the fashion industry, so she\u2019s a bit picky about what she wears. I never thought about sitting down with her to write down every item on her wishlist. Because what she can buy, she already buys; and what she can\u2019t buy, I can\u2019t help her with. At least, that\u2019s what I think. So, today, she bought a Chanel lipstick (first time after 3 years) and I (intended to say let me pay) asked for the price, and she replied $50. I said, \u201cWow, a $50 lipstick? Normal people can never use this.\u201d I can\u2019t afford it at the moment, so I didn\u2019t suggest paying for her either. She felt disappointed because of what I said, and because I never buy her any significant things except on birthdays (her last birthday\u2019s gift was a small necklace worth 1/5 of my monthly income) and some special occasions in the 4 years we've been living together. Apart from occasional flowers, I rarely buy her any significant gifts in daily life because I never save enough for this. I mean, it\u2019s not my priority to buy her excessive stuff that she doesn\u2019t really need. So, AITA for not putting my wife's girly stuff more on top of my priority? ----  **EDIT:** As everybody mention about the 50$ lipstick, I must say it's not a big deal for something you will use in 3 years. I just not prepare for that (I thought around 20$ to 30$), so it shock me and I say it out so unthoughtfully. Yep, so her point is not about this lipstick but the fact that I rarely buy her nice stuffs apart from special events. As I can see, my reason as not saving enough for this kind of stuffs is weak and kind of the excuses. On the other hand, we should have more conversation on how the expense is splitted. **EDIT2:** I read all of your comments and feel very thankful. Since this is the first time I tell my story in Reddit and I don't know what to expect. I just try to put on a short version of the situation for not wasting your time. Apparently, it lacks of some information and clarification. I want to answers some FAQ below and give my conclusion. **1. Is she usually have gifts for me? What are those?**  She gifted me many shirts (5 to 7) and pants (~3) in the first year we met, not so after that. She gift me 3 birthday presents - a coat, a helmet, and a phone (a decent 2nd-hand phone I choose to replace my broken one). I don't really remember anything else recently. Now looking back, I can tell how she's obsessed with fashion and want to put nice clothes on me. I feel thankful, for sure, but you see, those things are practically good, but too boring.  My birthdays gift for her is an Instax Camera, a wooden music box with horses cart riding the marrying couple (which turn out to be our's daughter favorite toy...), and a necklace (her choice). I tried to be creative. **2. Do I know that what she want is only a tangible gift to show her my love?** Yes, I know. She told this directly to me. In my defend, I want to shout out that my financial strain caused by following her lifestyle so I could hardly budget anything even for myself (I'm not doing that, I'm writing here to ask for your help instead). I bought her flowers once every two months. I bought snacks and small gifts (funny key chains, etc) occasionally. But those things is too easy to buy so maybe she dismissed it. **3. Do we have joint account? Do we really pay 50/50?** We used to have a joint account (and we put 50/50 into it), somehow it's complicated to handle it so we dismiss it after 2 or 3 months of marriage and spend on our own. Yes, we target for 50/50 on essential things. The renting, the kids (daughter and cats) expense, the market's foods and dine out meal, health care, daily stuffs,.... It's vary depend on every months. But I could say she paying more in general. It could be something between 55/45 to 60/40.  Even I pay less, my money is running out frequently. (For example, she pay 1000$ and I pay 800$). She still have a big deal of money to spend on clothes and sandals and accessories for her and our daughter (more than what their need), expensive fruits and snacks, milk tea,... After that, she still remains some for saving. **4. Does she a materialistic person?** No, I don't think so. I think it's because our love language is un-align.  For example, I touch her and say I love her a lot, but she doesn't enjoy doing that. She usually said it's not the words matter, the actions (gifts?) matter. I spend time with her, listen to her more than enough, and she think that's just obvious couple's obligations. Maybe I should know better about her love language. **5. My conclusion** As many of you pointed out, the question is why I'm still staying here, in the financial strain situation.  I must have a real talk with her (or us with counselor) to set up an equitable expense, not equally expense. Following that, we should have a joint account. I should also budget for some gifts, which is her go-to love language. Thank you very much for supporting me. I can't see how I get through this without your words. I hope I can give you a best UPDATE as I can.",

        "selftext": "Greetings good folks of Reddit, The title pretty much sums up the situation. My father owns a rental property, which we live in, and the remaining 2 units are rented out. Tenant #2, who we will call Mary, drops off her rental check in our mail box. If she is on vacation, or otherwise going away for an extended period of time, she\u2019ll give her rent before she leaves. Sometimes, her brother will bring the rent by to us on her behalf when she is away. It always gets dropped off in our mailbox. Tenant #1, who we will call Juan, does not like to use our mailbox to drop off his rent check. He insists on dropping off his rent in person to whoever is home. If no one is home, or we don\u2019t get back until really late, then he will try again the next day. We\u2019ve told him the mailbox is fine, but he insists on in-person delivery, as he is afraid of check theft/check washing. This would be fine\u2026 except he doesn\u2019t wait for us to open the door. He knocks, rings the doorbell, and when I get to the top of the stairs and look down, he already has the door open and is waiting by the bottom of the stairs. We live on the top floor. The door to our house opens up to a staircase, which leads up to the kitchen to one side and the hallway to the family room on the other side. Unless we lock the door, which we don\u2019t necessarily do during the daytime when we are home, he just opens the door and lets himself in (never going further than the landing at the bottom of the stairs). Today, he came by to drop off the rent. As expected, he rang the doorbell and was waiting at the bottom of the stairs, having let himself in. I asked him -painfully polite as I am terrified of confrontation- \u201cHi Juan! Next time, can you please wait for one of us to open the door?\u201d He looked like I cursed his ancestors, spat in his face, and shit on his carpet. He said \u201cYou don\u2019t want me to open the door?\u201d I said we would prefer if he waited for one of us to open the door for him. He said he opens the door because he doesn\u2019t know if our doorbell works. I assured him, with a smile on my face, that it does work, and that we hear it loud and clear whenever he rings it. He said okay and left, visibly upset. Guys, I cannot emphasize enough how much I hate confrontation, and what a people pleaser I am. I was smiling the entire time, asked him how he and his family were doing, and was pleasant the entire time. He looked at me like I spoke some unimaginable horror. Am I crazy Reddit? Is it wrong of me to have asked Juan to wait by the door to our home until one of us opens it? I feel like not wanting someone to let themselves into your home isn\u2019t a big ask, but he looked so offended, that I am going crazy questioning myself over it. I leave it to you guys to pass judgment. Edit to add a few things: Bumping up edit 4: Additional edit to clarify that **the front door is locked 24/7**. It is the back door that is left unlocked for a small window in the middle of the day, and only when someone is home. 1. The door is locked the majority of the time. There is a *small* window of a few hours in the middle of the day, only when someone is home, that my parents (the actual homeowners) will leave the door unlocked to allow family to come in. 2. I am not the homeowner. I would keep the door locked 24/7 if I was. 3. To the person who said they\u2019d like to see my reaction if something actually important happened in my life, when I said I am \u201cgoing crazy\u201d it was just hyperbole. I am more so confused at the tenant\u2019s strong reaction. 4. Additional edit to clarify that **the front door is locked 24/7**. It is the back door that is left unlocked for a small window in the middle of the day, and only when someone is home. 5. Additional edit to add that my parents don\u2019t care how the tenants pay, whether it is a paper check or an e-transfer. The tenants are older, and prefer to deal with paper checks. 6. I said what I did to Juan **at the request of my parents**.",

        "selftext": "Details changed for anonymity. My wife's younger sister is lazy, knows everything and perpetually unemployed. Her main source of income is her mother. I have automotive experience (body work, mechanical, electrical, etc) which I'm always willing to use for friends and family.  Several years ago, her car died. I told her I would come the next day to help her purchase something dependable and in her budget.  She was happy with the offer and I started searching the internet for cars. The next day I call and she gleefully tells me she has already bought something from a small used  car lot. And (I wish I was making this up) paid the dealer more than they were asking because it was such a good deal. How did she know it was so under priced? The salesman told her of course!  And they're always so honest. The car: right front bumper and fender are dented and the light is cracked. She tells me that parking  brake failed and it rolled into another car. I noticed the car lot fixed the parking brake prior to her purchasing it. She said it's fine, they already fixed the parking brake wire again so it's all good. The car was burning and leaking oil so I told her to return if but they refused because now it was damaged. Her insurance covered the other person's car, but not hers. I did a quick, but safe, fix on it. This was a recurring situation. I fixed that car (at my own expense) numerous times. Finally it died and I offered to help her buy a different car. She was very receptive and told me to start looking at options.  The next morning she decided that she knew best and bought another lemon but never told me. She spent more on repairs than she paid for the car.  That car died a month ago and the person who loaned her a car wanted it back ASAP. Yet again I offered to help her find a dependable car. She seemed on board with it, sending me links to cars. Then she shows up at our house with another dumpster on wheels. Literally one of the cars I said to avoid at all costs. She never said a thing about buying it and obviously wasted my time again. I didn't hold back. I told her the car was garbage. It has an engine noise and unburned fuel smell in the exhaust.  Then she had the nerve to ask me to fix it. I just said No, not happening. I told her that I was texting and calling trying to help her find a good car 3x and she let me keep looking after buying a car. I told her since she's obviously so good at finding amazing used cars she should be able to find a mechanic to fix it since it's on it's death bed.  She acted offended and mentioned that she really needs the help and I always helped previously. I said too bad, should have bought a good car.  Now my wife is pressuring me to help her sister because she just doesn't know any better. I said this is how she learns. We're not arguing about it,  but it's definitely causing tension here.  Should I cave in and fix this pile of trash or let her find out actions have consequences? ",

        "selftext": "To give a bit of context before I start with explaining what happened. My family consists of me (M20), my sister (F24), and my mom and dad. We moved countries when I was 10-years old due to a few legal issues my dad got in, and have lived in the country we are now in ever since. To cut a long story short, my mom became emotionally abusive to me and my sister, which left me with a lot of issues and a warped perspective on dating, marriage, and having children. That brings us to what happened yesterday. It was my grandma's birthday, and they had come to visit us for it (grandma and grandpa). Things had been going fine so far, until the topic of what I wanted to do after University came up. I shared my plans of wanting to move to another country and then maybe settling down there or keep moving. That made my grandma ask me about kids, and why I had never dated before.  I explained to her my reasons, and she seemed to understand it (or so I thought). Later on, when everyone had a bit to drink, the topic came up again but with them first focusing on my sister, before it shifted back to me. My grandma asked me, again, whether I was sure I didn't want kids, and I confirmed to her that I didn't. She then went on this sort of rant of how as a man I had to have kids, and I couldn't just play video games all my life (I study game development and have made a few games already which did quite well on Steam). I was getting slowly uncomfortable and tried to change topics, but she didn't stop. It eventually got to a point where she called me dramatic, and said I was overreacting and to man up, and how, yes, my mom and dad did have issues, but they still did a good job raising us and deserved grandkids. At this point I kind of lost it and I told her that me even talking to my parents right now and not planning on cutting them off after I left was already me giving them more then they deserved, and that if she wanted grandkids she should've raised her daughter (my mom) better (from what my mom had told me, my grandma and grandpa had also been pretty shitty parents).  I then left to go upstairs and only heard them arguing downstairs. It eventually died down and my grandma and grandpa went back to their hotel, and later on my sister called me to inform me that my grandma had started crying after I had left, and my parents were partially blaming me for it now and wanted me to apologize, but they had called her cause they knew she and I had a really close bond. My sister agreed that I was in the right after my grandma had been so insanely pushy about this topic, when I had made it clear it made me uncomfortable, but I am not sure whether what I said and did was the correct thing to do. So, I wanted to come on here and ask people with no bias whether you all think I overreacted and shouldn't have made my grandma cry, or whether I was in the right to set my boundaries straight.",

        "selftext": "My parents got divorced and my mom moved out. I was still living at the house with my dad and I was covering the utilities which I agreed to help. I had been with my girlfriend(now fianc\u00e9e at the time of their divorce). Well I pretty much moved in with her and was staying at her house during the week and going home on the weekends. It eventually changed to never really going back home unless I needed to speak to my dad about something. He\u2019s been a heavy drinker for most of my life which he still is at this point. Me and my fianc\u00e9e have a baby on the way and we\u2019ve been looking for a place to live and we found one. The only bad thing about the whole situation is that my dad is looking as well and he\u2019s been bugging me about co-signing on a loan with him to get a house but he keeps telling me that he\u2019s going to pay it off with the money from house when it sells. But he\u2019s been saying that we could all move in together and I just don\u2019t think it would be a good idea with the baby and I also don\u2019t feel comfortable doing it and I explained to him because of mine and fianc\u00e9es situation. But anyways, yesterday me and her went to my dads house(that\u2019s currently being sold) to pack some stuff up and he was leaving to go take a walk and he said to me that \u201cI killed him for not co-signing with him\u201d. I\u2019m feeling really guilty about it and it\u2019s been tugging at my heart. I just want to know\u2026 Am I the asshole and in the wrong for not helping him? Or should I have helped and jeopardized me and my fianc\u00e9e\u2019s future?  -EDIT-Okay so I apologize to everyone that has replied about not providing enough information I was typing this out on my phone and didn\u2019t want a massive paragraph for everyone to read. So I\u2019m going to answer some of the questions that I was seeing in the comments. Me(M26) and my fianc\u00e9e (F27) have been together since 2018 and have a baby on the way that will be born in May. We are going through the buying process of a home currently. My father and mother are getting half of the money that the house is being sold for after the remaining balance of the house is paid but the only reason he wants me to co-sign on the loan is because his credit isn\u2019t the best. He got a DUI a couple years ago so he doesn\u2019t car so he basically relies on me to take him places which I don\u2019t mind taking if I have time and it\u2019s places like the grocery store, appointments, etc. but I feel like he\u2019s been getting pretty comfortable with it cause he doesn\u2019t ask me anymore just basically demands that I do it now.

        "selftext": "(Throwaway account BTW.) My husband\u2019s (34m) sister, Kendall (17f), has been living with us for almost 6 years now. This came to be because of major issues within my husband\u2019s family and living conditions that were unsuitable for her to be in. AKA, my husband\u2019s mom is a major hoarder w/ OCD. Beside that, my husband and I are both extremely proud of Kendall and how far she has come. She will be 18 soon (the sending-her-off-to-college blues are hitting hard!) and is halfway done with her senior year. To celebrate, her school throws a formal every year in January. The school also has an actual prom at the end of the last semester, but most kids treat the formal like they traditionally would for prom. Why? I have no idea. That\u2019s just how it is, lol.  Kendall has gone to this dance for the last two years. Both times I was the one who took her shopping for it. Both times I also asked her mother if she wanted to be present and she made up some fake excuse or didn\u2019t answer. I texted my MIL and asked if she wanted to come this time around but I told Kendall to not count on anything because of what happened the last two times. Kendall also texted. As expected, she never responded. Kendall was disappointed but she accepted it and moved on. I sat there for 3 hours while she tried on dresses. I think she looked beautiful in all of them, but the one she picked out was really a show stopper. We bought the dress, showed my husband, and some tears were shed. A mom of one of the girls in Kendall\u2019s friend group hired a photographer and so they took pictures there before going to the actual event. I took a few of my own before I sent her on her way. I posted the pictures of her I took on my Facebook (don\u2019t judge, I\u2019m old and will never switch to Instagram \ud83e\udd23) the morning after. She was getting tons of love from family members/moms of her friends.  After\u2014at most an hour\u2014of the post being up, my MIL called me and started berating me for apparently \u201ccausing her to miss one of the last important events of her childhood\u201d. I told her that I texted AND so did her daughter! She gave some excuse along the lines of being busy and how how I should\u2019ve told her in person. She didn\u2019t care the other two times we went dress shopping but now she does? My husband is behind me and thinks his mom is being entitled, but his extended family thinks the opposite. The same people who were commenting on my post have completely switched up and have been sending me nasty messages about how I\u2019m essentially trying to exclude my MIL from Kendall\u2019s life. That is not true. I don\u2019t know how badly she twisted the story, but some of those people have been riding my MIL\u2019s ass for years. My mom thinks I should\u2019ve made more of an effort and is guilting me with the \u201ccoming from a mother\u201d standpoint. Am I wrong for not trying harder? My husband\u2019s family is starting to make me feel shitty about myself but I also know that my MIL not being there was probably better for Kendall\u2019s confidence in the long run.",

If it isn\u2019t his family vs mine, she\u2019s making comments about my body.  Some brief examples are her demanding she be at appointments and ultrasounds bc \u201cmy mom gets to\u201d. My mom never went to a single one or even asked to. Another example is when I did an at home blood test to know the gender. I had the gender sent to my mom because she was going to make a cake for us. The day we went over there to find out his mom called crying because it wasn\u2019t fair that my mom already knew. We said we\u2019d send her a video of us cutting the cake as soon as we did. She threw a fit and made my mom send her the gender before we cut it so that she knew too.  Then there was my baby shower where she got mad and uninvited me from dinner because I created a Facebook event for the baby shower before the physical invites went out. We have family out of town and I didn\u2019t know the invites would take a week to mail out. She doesn\u2019t have Facebook and claimed that she shouldn\u2019t have to find out from Facebook and that\u2019s how she\u2019s going to find out the baby is born etc. when we tried to explain that the physical copies were one their way she said that I should have thought more about it before I posted it \u201call over Facebook\u201d \u2026 it was a private event.  She also got mad that she wasn\u2019t allowed in the room while I gave birth.. and then made a comment that I wouldn\u2019t be able to feed my baby either breast milk because I\u2019m \u201ctoo small\u201d? My final straw was when she was holding my 2 month old baby and the baby started crying. She said \u201cwell it\u2019s because she doesn\u2019t know me and she\u2019ll never know your family like she knows hers\u201d.  Because of that final comment I now try not to see her at all costs. I feel she is always rude to me and makes my life miserable. I know this strains my bf and hers relationship but I just think these things are really rude and unforgivable. Am I the asshole for keeping my baby from her? ",

        "selftext": "Hey everyone,  So kind of an interesting situation. My biological father hasn\u2019t been in my life for probably around 25 years. He was in a very physical relationship with my mother and his ex wife while they had relationships. He was arrested and deported back to Mexico when I was about 11. Haven\u2019t heard from him at all since.  Fast forward to 2022 I get a random email from a young lady claiming to be my 18 year old sister. She and I talked after confirming some information about each other and her siblings who I knew of since I had met them when they were toddlers. She sent my information to my dad and he\u2019s been messaging me periodically from time to time.  Just a few months ago he asked for $100. I felt ok sending that to him because I felt this was a step to possibly rebuild our relationship. He ghosted me for 6 months after I sent messages asking how he was, if he was ok and all that. He messaged me again today asking for more money. No response from the other messages when I sent him pictures of his granddaughters. He\u2019s been continuously asking even after I said no.  I explained this all to my brothers and they said I should just give him the money and that I\u2019m being a AH for just helping him out. I feel like it\u2019s enabling him to keep asking. I\u2019m torn I want to help because he\u2019s my dad, but on the other hand I don\u2019t want to seem like a piggy bank for him. ",

        "selftext": "I don\u2019t really know what to do but I\u2019m really anxious and upset about this. a few months ago, my kitten poked some holes in my roommates gaming chair. it\u2019s a 300 dollar chair. she told me about it and i took some pictures of the damage. the holes aren\u2019t deep but there are little bits of leather peeling. i told her i could get something to fix it, but eventually i told her that i would pay for it to get fixed bc i didn\u2019t trust my skills.  today she sent me a long paragraph about how my kitten has been chewing her decorative flowers, chewing her cables and headphones to the point where they don\u2019t work, and that her chair is still ruined and she wants reimbursement for it.  i showed my parents and they agreed to 100% pay for a new chair if she gave us the ruined chair. this chair really isn\u2019t \u201cruined,\u201d it just has a few little holes that i could probably crudely fix with glue. we assumed she was going to scrap the chair because of how she presented it (\u201che (my cat) fucked it up\u201d) but I didn\u2019t want it to go to waste. i also could sell the chair for some of the money back. she said she wants to keep the ruined chair. when my mom saw that she said this, she flipped out. i understand why. my mom said that\u2019s basically giving her a gift, not a reimbursement. my roommate said she wanted to keep the chair so that she can have one chair in her room at the apartment, and one in her room at her parents house so she doesn\u2019t have to bring it back and forth.  the way she worded this ircked me a lot. my parents 100% agreed that if she doesn\u2019t give us her ruined chair, we are not paying anything for a new one for her. she\u2019s really mad at this. when i got home she was crying about how her stuff is ruined, and how my cat got into her cables and broke her headphones. i told her she should keep her door closed from now on like our other roommates do, that way there\u2019s no chance he\u2019ll (my cat) get in and he\u2019ll get used to not being in the room, like he did with our other roommates. she kept the door open, and low and behold he walked right into her room. she then cried more about him being in there.  i\u2019m going to keep my cat in my room from now on, only letting him out when i\u2019m home to supervise. he has plenty of toys, wall shelves to climb, and things to do in my room. everything is in here, so it\u2019ll just be a bit of an adjustment for him. she\u2019s been texting me for the entire rest of the night talking about how her stuff is ruined and shes saying things like \u201cwhat do i do?\u201d and \u201ci don\u2019t know what to do\u201d. i\u2019m starting to think she\u2019s trying to guilt me into giving her the money. am i overreacting to this? should i give her the money? i dont know what to do.  EDIT: I should probably add that my roommate will actively seek out my cat while he\u2019s in my room to bring into her room, that\u2019s where the problem lies. I try to keep him separated from precious materials, but I\u2019m not always there to supervise.  my cat is NOT destructive as most people are saying. he has never ripped apart anything. her chair is the thing she\u2019s upset about, but the only other thing my cat has gotten into is her headphone cable. but my cat doesn\u2019t go around chewing and scratching things. he didn\u2019t scratch her chair, either. it was holes poked from him walking on it and putting out his claws a bit. neither me nor my other roommates have ever had a problem.  EDIT/UPDATE: 2/6/25 Thanks guys for the comments. I took lots of your advice and me and my roommate were able to \u201ctalk it out\u201d (she came to me and apologized profusely). I think my roommates mom is still upset though, because her mom called MY mom and bitched about it apparently. I wasn\u2019t there, but that\u2019s what my mom said happened. Anyways thanks a bunch for helping me not spiral into a panic attack! ",

        "selftext": "I really didn\u2019t mean to cause any harm with this, but I\u2019m 24 hours everything has blown up. I (17f) had the first day of school yesterday. It\u2019s my final year of high school, and I\u2019m pretty involved with school clubs, so I know a lot of people even though I\u2019m not popular and not involved with much drama, until no. On the way home I saw some friends I hadn\u2019t talked to over the holidays and while chatting one of them brought up a girl we can call Layla (16f). Two of my friends had heard that Layla was telling people her sister Cassidy (18f) who graduated last year is now pregnant. I knew Cassidy and even though we weren\u2018t close friends, she was always super nice. None of us really believed it, but they had both heard it separately, and thought it was weird. I thought since Cassidy wasn\u2019t at school to defend herself or even hear about it, someone should tell her that people in Y11 and Y12 were hearing it. So I dm\u2019d her on instagram telling her what I\u2019d heard, said I didn\u2019t believe it, and didn\u2019t really expect a response. She messaged me back thanking me and asking a few question, and I thought I\u2019d done the right thing. Apparently not, because today Layla found me at lunch and yelled at me for messaging her sister. Turns out their mum saw the message and now they have family drama, and are blaming Cassidy for the rumour being spread, not Layla. Layla said she had no idea the rumour was spreading at all, and she had no part in it. Layla also said I had no right inserting myself in family drama, and if the I heard one of Cassidy\u2019s friends spread the rumour it would have been fine, but since I thought it was her, I should have gone to Layla first, not Cassidy. She was yelling so loud and for so long teachers got involved and tried to set up meetings for us and potentially our parents as well, but I said it wasn\u2019t necessary. I apologised to Layla for causing family drama, but said I didn\u2019t feel bad for telling Cassidy what was being said about her, because I thought she deserved to find out as soon as possible. Layla said I wasn\u2019t Cassidy\u2019s friend, and not to see her, talk to her, or message her again. Even so, I messaged Cassidy an apology for starting family drama, which I am genuinely sorry for. She hasn\u2019t responded, and I don\u2019t expect her to. But even so, I don\u2019t think I was the asshole for telling Cassidy there was a pregnancy rumour about her.   EDIT for clarity: Cassidy is not pregnant and Layla said she didn\u2019t start it or tell anyone",

        "selftext": "My 20(F) Boyfriend 23(M) have been dating seriously for about 6 months now.He lives about an hour away from me which was never a problem in the past when we have drove to see each other. Recently he has been working a lot and has been asking if I could drive to his place more frequently, because he is usually very exhausted as he works a very physically demanding job. Me, wanting to be an understanding girlfriend, has had zero problem with driving to see him, as he is truly my favorite person and I love seeing him.  Side note, neither of us are financially unstable, we both have great paying jobs and both have willingly supportive families if we ever needed help.  I think I drive to his place far more often and I have never had a problem with the drive taking up all my gas, unless there is massive amounts of traffic that causes me to be driving for almost 3 hours on the way back home. But even then, i'll just buy gas myself as I have no problem with it being wasted on him.  Last week, I had a talk w/ him asking if he could possibly drive up to me this time as I had an incredibly busy few weeks ahead and would really appreciate it as we haven't seen each other in a while, since I haven't driven to see him in a minute. He agreed in a very sullen tone, that kinda irked me but I remembered that he is very consistently exhausted from work, and brushed it off.  Until yesterday, the day we agreed for him to drive up comes, and on his way to me I get a call that consisted of him complaining about how this drive took up a lot of his gas, and he said quote,  You need to pay me gas money for this trip, for here and back. I, being confused, asked, Is there a lot of traffic? He responded, No, just driving all this way has sucked up all my gas and I feel like it's only fair for you to compensate me. I reply, I get that, but I've just never personally asked you for it before. He responds, Well if you did, I would.  I said that we would talk about it once he gets here, trying to avoid a disagreement, but instead he decides to hang up on me and I guess turns around. I check our shared life360 about 30 minutes later when he was supposed to get to my house, and it shows him already almost back at his house. I tried to call him multiple times, but he only texted me that I was being unfair and ridiculous. AITA? UPDATE: Im so glad this was over quickly, I just posted this literally last night.  One of his friends who also uses reddit luckily stumbled across my post, and immediately recognized it to be me, due to my username and just him knowing of me and my former boyfriends driving situation.  He messaged me today and told me everything my then boyfriend NOW EX, was hiding from me for the past 6 months. Turns out, my now ex HAS NEVER HAD A JOB. HIS JOB was him going and banging his stupid ass ex girlfriend all the time. He was actually fully reliant on his parents money, and recently got cut off, due to him just being an absolute trash human being, which I see now. That's his reason for begging for gas money all of a sudden, and why he seemed so checked out from this relationship as so many of you were saying in the comments.  BTW, i've never met his parents before, and now I understand why, his parents never knew about me, he was using me all this time, for literally no reason basically, we weren't together for that long. Also, some of you might think I would know if my so called boyfriend didn't actually have a job, but we only talked for a month before getting into a committed relationship, It's not like we have known each other for years. It's pretty easy to hide a fake job, and somehow he did it perfectly the maniac he is.  You may think it's suspicious why his so called friend decided to spill this all to me so quick, and it's because my former boyfriends ex he's been cheating on me with, is the friends ex. He knew about me, but didn't know the ex who my former boyfriend was seeing was THAT ex, that they had a early fallout about in their friendship. We are both equally pissed and now me and him are thinking about ways we can get mild revenge, and I'll update with the plans and execution of the plans later. I wasn't just gonna take the easy route of breaking up with him, he doesn't deserve the easy way out.",

        "selftext": "Hello! Longtime lurker, first time poster here. I (25F) went to a friend\u2019s wedding a few months ago. The friends are Matt (25M), and Susan (25F). We\u2019re all part of a much larger friend group that gets along pretty great. To preface, I have actually never attended a wedding before in my life, and I don\u2019t tend to dress up or put on makeup. Nothing against it, it\u2019s just expensive and time consuming and I work 16-hour days in a uniform. I was really excited when I got the invite, saved up, and went to a shop I know carries my size (I\u2019m fairly tall). The clerk was amazing and so helpful. He chose a selection of dresses that would be wedding appropriate that weren\u2019t close to what the bridal party would be wearing and we had a lot of fun trying things on and he hyping me up. One of the options I just fell in love with. It was a beautiful dark green silk \u201cbias-cut\u201d dress (think Kiera Knightley in Atonement, without the sash and less of a flowing skirt). We matched it with heels and I\u2019d never felt prettier. The dress was on sale too, so that was a plus! Wedding day comes and it\u2019s lovely. I\u2019m so happy for my friends. Susan ignores me, which is weird, but she\u2019s busy preparing and then the wedding is in full swing and the reception is busy so I don\u2019t think much of it. Everything goes off without a hitch and they drive off to their honeymoon. I suppose it\u2019s relevant, but I received several compliments on my outfit during the event. I didn\u2019t think it caused a scene, and it wasn\u2019t anything particularly effusive or over the top. I was doing the same to others so I didn\u2019t think it stood out.Everything concludes, we all have a nice time. No one says anything until tonight. We all got together for a \u201cWelcome Back!\u201d dinner for Matt and Susan. During the dinner Susan kept making snipes at me about what I wore, just incredibly passive aggressive. It was very clear she thought I overdressed. I didn\u2019t say anything at the time because I felt terrible. None of my friends corrected or stopped her either. But looking back on it I feel\u2026 wronged? She didn\u2019t give me the benefit of the doubt and I don\u2019t feel like my dress was over-the-top. I do think I likely look very different from how I normally dress and present myself, so that might be part of it?  I\u2019m trying not to go over the word limit but am very open to questions and elaborations if needed.  So Reddit, AITA?  TLDR: wore a nice dress to a wedding, the bride is angry ever since. AITA?  Alright, my update was way too long and I honestly don\u2019t know if I can shorten it and it still give all the details - so I\u2019m going to be posting it on my own profile. ",

        "selftext": "the title is pretty self explanatory but to give some background, i am turning 18 in a couple of weeks and am taking everyone in my family out for dinner. i have a big family with a lot of siblings, so as it stands there are nine people confirmed coming with more  yet to reply to my invite. the place we\u2019re going is expensive, which is fine, i\u2019m happy to pay for the meals because it\u2019s everyone i love and i want us all to have a good time.  the problem is my brother\u2019s (19m) girlfriend (17f). i\u2019m not fond of her at all, she\u2019s a fine person in her own right but i never warmed to her, and i feel like inviting her to my birthday would ruin the day for me and make me uncomfortable. but my brother has already assumed that she is invited and he would be incredibly angry at me if i came out and said i didn\u2019t want her there.  i\u2019m inviting my own girlfriend but not my older sister\u2019s (27f) boyfriend so it wouldn\u2019t be like everyone except for my brother would have their partners there. i just don\u2019t want this girl at my birthday, i don\u2019t want to spend money on someone i don\u2019t really care about, and i don\u2019t want people to be mad at me for saying it. so wibta?  edit: my brother (the one in this post) is now scurrying around in the comments please ignore him. i am embarrassed.",
