After practice most of the guys take a shower before heading to classes.  I was having a chat with a couple of the other guys on the team and getting changed at the same time. When I pulled down my pants one of the guys just said 'WTF dude' in a really shocked tone. I asked what the matter was. He said to go find a stall if I wanted to do that, or don't bother changing underwear.  Now, I sweat like crazy so obviously wanted to change underwear. But the stalls were being occupied and I didn't think it was expected to wait. It's a changing room, in my experience people change. It's not that big of a deal. We all shower after swim practice and nobody cares in the slightest. I'm comfortable in my own body and didn't think it was a big deal, but obviously don't want to make others uncomfortable either.

        "selftext": "Let's jump into this: I (29F) gave birth to my 3rd baby in November.  The women in my husband's family (his 2 sisters, our sil, and his mom) and I have a group chat whereas we send pictures of our kids, tell funny stories about our day, and, in this case, send updates about possible labor.  On this particular day in November, at 37 weeks plus 5 days gestation, I reached out to inform that this just might be the day my newest baby decides to make his grand entrance. I had been having strong contractions since 5:50 that morning.  Everyone, except sil (my husband's brother's wife) responded with excitement and praying hands emoji's.  Well, according to the nurses at the hospital, I wasn't dilated enough to be admitted, despite strong and frequent contractions.This was at noon. I updated the chat. Everyone seemed concerned and asked if I still thought if it might still be that day.  I assured it was most likely going to happen that day, judging from past experiences, but I would go home to labor in comfort. This is where i might be the a-hole.  My sil, who also gave birth to her 3rd baby a couple months prior (via c-section. I am not judging nor think of her as less than, just context is key) decided to text how glad she was that I wasn't in real labor and that it's better that I wait to have the baby another couple of weeks. She then sent a bunch of screen shots and links to articles about false labor and Braxton hicks. AS IF I HAD NEVER GIVEN BIRTH BEFORE OR EXPERIENCED PREGNANCY BEFORE. I replied, mid contraction:  Not to be bity, but this ain't my first rodeo, and I know how to Google things as well.  And yes, I have been checked, and they will check again before deciding IF I should go home or not. Well, I did go home, only to go back to the hospital a couple of hours later and had my baby at 10:15 that night.  Sil does not reply to me in texts, and has since unfriended me on Facebook. (Not that I really care about that.)  I just want to know it I was an a-hole for what I said... and, in hindsight, perhaps I shouldn't have been texting in the groupchat while in labor.  So, reddit. Was I an a-hole? Edit: I meant to elaborate on the c-section detail. Which definitely makes me come across as someone who looks down on her for it. Which I do not.  Her first baby was a preemie and she had an emergency c-section. Her youngest 2 were scheduled. The point I was trying to make was that our experiences with pregnancy and childbirth are completely different.  Which, I could have said without the c-section fact. My apologies.  Edit: a little more info about my sil and my relationship. She thinks she's the matriarch of the family, even if she won't admit it. We recently moved out of state (only 2 hours away, long drive, but not as long as they treat it), a few months before I gave birth, and she started cutting us out of family get together and even created a whole new group chat without my husband and me. She is always shocked at how intelligent my husband is because he went to community college instead of a university, like she did. I didn't go to college. I saw no point in going into debt, I didn't know what I would go to college for, so I decided to wait. So she often treats me like I am unintelligent.  I think the snappy text was probably long incoming. But it was poorly timed and shouldn't have been in a group chat.It was not the first time I had gone off on her in a group chat either. She singled me out a few months prior, questioning my ability to care for my kids by myself while my husband was away for a couple of days.  Yes, in the big family group chat.So I snapped back. My husband saw the message before me and said I'll let you handle her. As he held me back many times beforehand to keep peace. Like I said, it was possibly poorly timed but long incoming. ",

I was trying to show my wife that her and her pillow already took up over half of the bed, leaving me with little to no space, especially once or toddler laid down.  I tried telling her I needed more room but she kept making a joke of it. So I got in bed, grabbed the pillow she keeps at her back and tossed it into the hallway saying here this will help. The next thing I know my wife is furious, crying, and is gathering her other pillows and blanket saying if I'm that much of a problem you can just have the bed to yourself. Her and our toddler went to the toddler's room to sleep (that bed is a full). This morning my wife is still mad and barely speaking to me so I ask AITA for throwing my wife's pillow out of the room?

My mom was a drug addict, stopping during pregnancy, but when Mj was about 5 months old she started back on drugs, dropping Mj off any place she could. Seeing this I wanted to give Mj a life that she deserved, not what our mother gave me, even though I was only 19, i filed a petition to get custody of her, it was a long hard process but when Mj was 2 i finally got full custody, all this to say, im legally Mj\u2019s dad. Im the only dad she knows and she calls me dad. A year ago I met my girlfriend, Ida (24f) and we started dating not long after, I really thought I found somebody to like me and Mj, Ida would always take Mj on \u2018girls days\u2019 and  little \u2018dates\u2019. I proposed to Ida on Sunday, it seemed like everything was great until a few hours ago. Ida was at my apartment having dinner with me and Mj, well when i was cooking dinner I heard Mj say something along the lines of \u2018Your gonna marry my daddy and your gonna be best friend\u2019 I thought it was cute until I heard Ida laugh and say \u2018He\u2019s not your dad Mj\u2019 which caught me off guard, i guess she thought i couldn\u2019t hear her because there\u2019s one a wall between the kitchen, but still i don\u2019t know why Ida said that. Mj was confused as 5 year olds are said I was and Ida kept correcting her until Mj started crying, Which honestly made me mad, I asked Ida why she would even say that and Ida stated \u2018She was going to find out eventually\u2019 and I was an arse for not telling Mj in the first place. I got mad and one thing led to another i said somethings i shouldn\u2019t have, telling her she had no right and Ida went home and Me and Mj had dinner alone, Ida started blowing up my phone later saying what I did was \u2018wrong\u2019 and basically was just ranting to me through text, I started doubting myself and now i\u2019m here. So AITA (I was gonna tell Mj i was her brother someday, yes, but when shes old enough to understand, Mj is only 5 she doesn\u2019t make sense of it) (Also sorry if im bad at explaining)",

We've managed two days so far, where even if he accidentally says something in English I answer in German, but last night he told me he needed a break from me speaking German. I refused, and said it's only for 10 weeks until my exam, then I'll go back to English. He says I don't sound like his wife when I speak German. I asked if it was because my mistakes were jarring or my vocab was causing issues. He said it just 'didn't feel like he was speaking to his wife'.

        "selftext": "Two years ago I saw an original watercolor piece that I liked and I contacted the artist and bought it. When the piece arrived I sought a frame for it, but I hadn\u2019t been able to find a frame for that size every time I went to the store. They were all too big or too small. So I just kept the piece in an envelope in my desk, I would sometimes look at it, remember I had to find a frame for it but would later forget again. Work, family and life leaves little time to devote to thinking about a frame for a painting and I don\u2019t have any framing businesses near me, so that wasn\u2019t either an option. Today my boyfriend is dusting and comes out of the office showing me the painting on a spare frame he had been using for something else. I ask him if that frame is 9x12. He tells me it\u2019s 8x10, that he had to cut a piece of the artwork to make it fit. When I look at it the piece went from a centralized composition to having the composition indented to the left side because he cut all whole inch on that side to save the artist\u2019s signature which was on the extreme opposite end (for reference, imagine I if you cut the Mona Lisa to the point where her head is no longer in the center). When he notices I\u2019m perplexed he nonchalantly tells me that the painting was in an envelope anyway, and it\u2019s better if it\u2019s out so we can see it. I get mad because this is not the first time he has taken something of mine and given it away, offer it to someone or just not ask and do whatever he wants with it. His mother does the same thing with his things at her house. In their family if you\u2019re not using something anyone can do with it as they please. I explained to him in my family you don\u2019t do anything with other people\u2019s stuff I have a tendency to ruminate on thoughts, so I try not to engage in negative emotions because then I just can\u2019t let go of them and I cycle and cycle through them and it makes my life miserable, and I have to devote a lot of energy to get me back to normal. Every time I looked at the framed painting I felt a new wave of sadness, anger and frustration ripple over me. So I took the frame down, took the painting out of it, ripped it into four pieces and threw it in the garbage. When my boyfriend saw it he was shocked and visibly hurt. I get that his intentions were good, but he ruined a piece of art that was not his to begin with. Now it\u2019s awkward at home because I\u2019m still fuming and he\u2019s sad. AITAH",

During the day I work out of a spare room and he works out of the living room, so during work hours these two spaces essentially work as two offices. I will refer to the room I work in as my office for simplicity sakes but it is not the exclusive use of that room and there is a second bathroom that can only be accessed through the spare room. I scare extremely easily. I usually keep the door open unless one of us is on a call, but very frequently my husband will walk into the room and scare me really badly. Like I'll *scream* and jump and for a few seconds I genuinely cannot control my reaction, like I feel like I almost white out for a second sometime it scares me so bad. I dont handle it very well, a good scare will leave me shaking for hours after. I know I'm very weak to being scared and that its an unreasonable reaction but I genuinely cannot control it. I have some trauma in my past that contributes, but I am working with a therapist. My partner takes a great deal of offence to my reactions, even though I try to explain I cant control them. Sometimes when he startles me like that I'll say something like Why did you do that? or why do you keep doing that? as a reaction and that hurts his feelings. I always apologize and try to assure him its not personal, its just what comes out of my mouth when I'm scared but I can tell it really bothers him. I've asked him to just pause and knock before he comes in but thats not really fair to make him stop and knock in his own house to enter a room that isnt exclusively for my use. The scares are bad enough that they can greatly impact my work day. I know this seems extreme, but a good scare makes me feel like my brain turns off for a while after until I get ahold of myself again. I suggested this morning, after a good scare, that maybe I should get a motion sensor door chime like they have at shops! I could install it in the hall just before my door and put the noise maker on my desk so that I'll hear the noise and know he's coming. My Partner thinks that thats over the top but I want to find a solution that will work. Would I be the asshole if I just bought a chime and set it up? edit: I'm reading everything as it comes in this is just a lot of messages thank you! edit2: sorry, I'm like, a little overwhelmed. A lot of people are saying he's doing it on purpose and I hadnt thought of that and I'm more than entertaining that idea. I'm gonna try my best to reply to comments, thank you Those curious about the Brad story it doesnt have an interesting conclusion but if enough people care I will post an FAQ over on ask reddit.",

She tried to keep it quiet but she paid off my dad\u2019s debts, bought him a small house, paid off her debts and paid for my sister\u2019s college and set up funds for mine.  She had a boyfriend at the time and shortly after him and his son who was 7 moved into our new house. Over the next few years mom bought my sister a house after she graduated college. Her boyfriend lived with us and didn\u2019t pay anything but he did work. When I was 21 mom got diagnosed with cancer. It wasn\u2019t good. She sat me and my sister down and went over exactly how much money there was. She intended to give her current house to me and both me and my sister were left with a large sum at the end of it.  She asked if I would allow her boyfriend to stay in the house with his son until he got his own place. I agreed. Before she died she told her boyfriend he would need to look for his own place but had time to save more for that journey. For the last 4 years he has continued to reside in the house with his son. I haven\u2019t minded because we get along okay. I pay all the bills but he does buy food for him and his kid. He has dated off and on and mostly kept the women out of this house which I respected him for.  Until his current partner.  She\u2019s been in my house 3 times and at first besides feeling a little uncomfortable I was okay with her. The last time this past weekend was the point where I lost my shit. I was making myself some lunch when she came walking downstairs. She grabbed a plate and went to grab food out of my pan. I asked her what she thought was doing. She started telling me how I should look for somewhere else to live and leeching off my dead mom\u2019s past relationship as an adult was pathetic. I hollered for my mom\u2019s old boyfriend he came down and I told him I didn\u2019t know what he current thing thought but I wasn\u2019t going to be disrespected in my house.  He wouldn\u2019t even look me in the eyes as he mumbled something about my mom promising him the house and he was just \u201cbeing kind\u201d letting me stay. First that isn\u2019t remotely true. Mom pulled him and i together after she asked if he could stay to set expectations. My mom met him shortly before she won the money and told him and us girls that she had no intention of leaving him money. She did set aside a fund for his son for college when he gets there but he cannot touch it, only his son can.  He has lived in this house almost 8 years without paying a dime he should have plenty of money and if he doesn\u2019t that\u2019s on him. I told him he had 30 days to leave. I wasn\u2019t going to house someone who would lie and disrespect me in my house. He left that night with his son but his ex wife called to tell me I am cruel and an AH for her son losing his house (he is here every other week). I really feel like my mom didn\u2019t expect him to still be here but my sister said she feels like I am breaking my promise to my mom and  that made me feel like maybe I am the AH.",

        "selftext": "TLDR; I\u2019m taking a day away from my husband and son to be comfortable with going back to work. Husband has never had a day alone with son so I asked him to try to figure it out but I\u2019ll be available if needed. He told his mother to come and help. I said no. He thinks I\u2019m ridiculous.  I (30F) and my husband (33M) welcomed our first child this past September. I have been fortunate to be on maternity leave but that ends next week. My husband had 2 months off and has been working full time since. He\u2019s off on Sundays and Mondays. I have never left my son except to go to a wedding in December but we were only away for 3 of his wake hours. My in laws watched over him and everything was fine.  I go back to work next week and my son will be attending day care. My husband is off this entire week and we\u2019ve just been taking a staycation. I told my husband though I want one day on my own to get more comfortable from being away from our baby and that I want him to have the day with the baby on his own. He has never been alone with him for more than an hour. He is a good father though and will help out when needed. But he has never been there for the full blown cries and fussiness while having to take care of the house.  A few days ago, we went to a friends house and our son was screaming bloody hell. Whenever I held him, he would calm down. Whenever my husband held him, he would just scream and cry even louder. So my husband just passed him along to me. I was getting frustrated cause I just wanted to relax with friends and he couldn\u2019t calm him down for a minute.  Today he tells me that his mom will be coming to help out. I asked him to tell her never mind cause he should be able to do it on his own. He called me ridiculous and it shouldn\u2019t matter but I think it really does. I can\u2019t be bothered at work unless absolutely necessary so I wanted t this to be our \u201ctrial\u201d. His mom will also be working on Mondays so it\u2019s not like she will be available to help out then. His mom is taking his side but of course she will cause our son is her only grandson.  So AITA for telling husband to figure it out and step up?  This is my first AITA post and I\u2019m frustrated just writing this so if you need more details to decide, just let me know and I\u2019ll respond.  ETA- I had a c section and I exclusively breastfed so I physically could not leave the baby in the first 2 months. My lactation consultant told me not to pump until after 2 months as I needed to establish my milk supply. He took care of my while I took care of baby. He doesn\u2019t do NOTHING. When I started pumping, husband was already at work. Husband does do feedings now.  ETA2 - this isn\u2019t a punch towards his mother. I adore her. It\u2019s really about him being independent with the baby. She helps us and I always appreciate it. Idk why yall think I\u2019m spiteful.  ETA3 - When my husband is home, I do separate myself from them by going to a different room. But he does often come to the room for help. I\u2019m not just dropping him off. ",

        "selftext": "I (28F) and my fianc\u00e9 (36M) are planning our wedding, and last night he accused me of being greedy and rude. Background: I come from a wealthy family and have worked hard to manage finances responsibly. My father has given each daughter $120K for their wedding. My sisters used all of it for their weddings, but I asked to use $70K for the wedding and $10K for a honeymoon, saving $40K to help with future children\u2019s expenses. My dad agreed to this plan, but only if I could make the wedding work with that budget. I didn\u2019t make this decision lightly. When I first got engaged five months ago, I considered using the full amount for a European wedding, but I realized I didn\u2019t want to prioritize that. A wedding is one day, and securing our future financial stability seemed more important. My fianc\u00e9 has been patient but has accused me of delaying the wedding due to indecisiveness, though I\u2019m just overwhelmed by spending so much on one day and managing everything else. Last night, I asked him to help review venues for a tour we\u2019re doing Monday. He rushed through options, and I started to cry from stress. I also wanted to vet the venues\u2019 prices before booking, but this frustrated him. He said I was rude for not wanting to use all the money for a wedding he would love, claiming that going over budget was fine because this was our most important day. He has always dreamed of a grand wedding with lots of guests. He criticized the venue I liked, an old library that only seats 180 and fits our budget. He said I was being rude by limiting my guest list to 60 people so he could invite 120 of his family. He also accused me of being \u201cgreedy\u201d for wanting to save the leftover money and said I looked like I was hoarding it. He argued that since we are financially well-off, I shouldn\u2019t worry about saving for future children. He also mentioned that our wedding planner had supposedly said I was being greedy, though he later admitted to making that up to show me how rude I was being. I thought I was being fiscally responsible by saving the extra money, but now I\u2019m questioning if I\u2019ve made the right decision. AITA?",

        "selftext": "I\u2019m going to jump right in because the funeral is this Friday. My ex husband passed away last week in a car accident, very unexpectedly. The troopers came to my house (I\u2019m his emergency contact) to break the news. The first person I called was his father, and he flew out the next day with my exs sister. Before he flew out he asked me where we should have the service, in texas (where we live) or back in Maryland where our families and friends all still live.  I told him I felt like the service needed to be in Maryland because that was where everyone was and P (my exes father) agreed. He let me know the funeral home said they might be able to do a small viewing with just family and I agreed to doing that as long as I felt like he was in a condition he\u2019d be ok with.  I met my exes sister and his dad at the funeral home to go over paperwork and plan the viewing, he told me all the details for the funeral back home and we talked a bit about where my ex worked, his day to day life, his home, and the probate process. His father was taking care of the probate process and seemed defensive about some of his belongings, I really felt like focusing on my children was more important than arguing over small things in the home\u2026 all of that could wait so I backed off of helping with cleaning out him home and handed all of his insurance paperwork and other information I had that would be useful to them like contacts at his work and his electric login.  We had the viewing, both of our children said goodbye to their dad and it was very emotional. At the viewing I mentioned that a friend had paid for our tickets to fly home as I was quickly realizing how much everything was going to cost and I suddenly was without the financial help of their dad.. I was extremely thankful for their generosity.  After the viewing I didn\u2019t hear anything from his sister or dad, they didn\u2019t ask to see the kids or let me know what was going on with the process and I was actively trying to navigate the life insurance process while grieving my ex and helping my children with their feelings. The last few days have been a blur of crying and anger for all of us, we are so heartbroken to have lost him.  My exes sister and father flew out on Friday and around noon I got a call from his father telling me we were not welcome at the funeral and that my children and I would be a distraction to his (my exes father) families grieving.  I\u2019m shocked and hurt, I told him I had never heard anything so hateful and the conversation was over.  My exes father and sister have never visited texas, we\u2019ve lived here for 4 years. They were not close and had no idea where he worked, or even any recent photos of him. We were divorced but still good friends, and my ex was a devoted father. His children were his world.  AITA for not listening to his father and still taking them? The funeral is open to anyone, I can\u2019t imagine us being there among hundreds of other people will really be a problem.  Edit: for those asking his reason, he said \u201cwell I gave you a nice service here\u201d -we had a short viewing only and had previously agreed to the service being in Maryland so no, there was no service.  Also for clarity I am the beneficiary on the policies, my ex and I did his open enrollment together every year and we put each other as our beneficiaries to make it easier if anything like this ever did happen  I have a wrongful death attorney and he is helping me with the process but I will reach out to a probate attorney.  Thank you to everyone for the advice on SSI ",

Get up rubbing my eyes and check the hatch which is closed, no ladder present below hatch means no one got in there from the hatch. I put my ladder there and check the attic, empty. Hear something running on the roof at this point, prolly a cat. Get down, SO is panicking asking what I saw, tell her nothing in the attic, something maybe on the roof. She  wants to call the cops and is asking a 100 questions. Ask her to wait while I check it out to settle her down. I circle the house twice while shining a bright torch over the roof. Don't see anything there. Get inside house and explain I went around the house twice shining the torch on the roof. There is no one there. But I am bombarded with 'who was it then'? No one. 'who could it have been?' no one was there . 'what were they doing on the roof' I don't even know if someone was there. 'how could they have gotten up there' I don't know. 'how do you not know, take a guess' I don't think anyone was there, probably a cat running around. 'You need to go speak with the neighbors to see if they saw something while I call the cops' I am not going to wake the neighbors at 3am and you are not calling the cops, just go to bed. 'No you need to go speak with the neighbors because you don't know anything. You don't know who it was, what they were doing there, how they got up there' 'Listen, I don't know who was there. I cannot know this. I don't know what they were doing there, I cannot know this, I dont know how they got up there, if you want to ask hypothetically then maybe they flew there, they parachuted off a plane and landed there, maybe it was spiderman. I just don't know because I cannot know. I have walked around the house and found nothing. You think me waking the neighbor will solve the mystery even though he knows less than us?   She is pissed off now saying it was a stressful situation and that I should have been cooperative and understanding of her feelings but instead I was a real asshole. No matter which way I look at it I can't think where I went wrong. I am not in the best moods at 3am",

        "selftext": "My baby shower is today and I was just told last night my aunt will be visiting for a few days from a different state and today is her birthday. Previous to last night I was unaware of her birthday or her even coming, then I was told my mother bought her A cake and plan on having everyone sing happy birthday at my shower. My issue is that there will be multiple strangers who have no clue who she is that will be forced to awkwardly sing to her, and they couldn\u2019t wait for another day. She is going to be here for a few days so Im confused why they couldn\u2019t simply take her to dinner after the event or a different day. When i expressed my concern my family implied I\u2019m being selfish and then proceeded to say I have no choice as I didn\u2019t pay for the shower. This is my first child and my family has made it clear this will be my one and only baby shower. So AITA for asking that this one event (not even the entire day just the event) to be about me only?  Edit: To everyone saying I should be happy to share this with my aunt because she came for me, I never said she came FOR me or for this shower. She just happens to be here and It would be a different situation if I were closer to this aunt but as previously mentioned im distant enough to have not even known it was her birthday. Also when this tia was originally told about my pregnancy she was insanely negative and criticizing telling me to possibly abort.  ",

        "selftext": "I'm pissed over this so please tell me if this makes no sense. I, (22F) have been with my incredible girlfriend, Layne (22F) for just over a year now. I introduced her to all my friends about four months in and since then she's been hanging out with us (seven including me) regularly. So, I have a friend, Freya (23F), who is kind of nosy. For a couple weeks, Layne has been out of town (before anyone asks, she didn't want me to come. I offered but she said she just needed to do this alone) for family issues I won't spill here, and Freya has been nagging me like crazy about it. Me and my friends all go to the same university, and we hangout pretty much everyday, so I can't avoid her.  First, I thought it started with honest concern. I told her what I said before, that she's out of town for some family stuff. Plain and simple. Subtly trying to get the idea across that it's none of her fucking business. She accepted that for all of one day. She then amped it up to pressing about exactly *what* the family thing is. I just kept shutting her down, calmly asking her to drop it, saying that Layne doesn't want her stuff being aired out like that (which she had explicitly told me). But she just wouldn't take no for an answer. Just kept insisting that it was fine if she knew, and I would just ignore her. Last night was my last straw. We were hanging out at a local bar when Layne called me. I told my friends I'd be back in a bit and went outside to take it. Layne was pretty upset, so I told her I'd get a cab and go home so I could fully focus on her. I quickly went back into the bar to tell my friends I had to go, mind you, I still had Layne on the line because I was only anticipating for it to take a minute. I just said something like Hey guys, but I gotta go, see you later, and pointed at the ongoing call. Freya, who was dead sober, decided it was a great idea to try to grab my phone from my hand, yelling questions at Layne. I backed up and held the phone to my chest, completely surprised because seriously what the fuck? I yelled at her to back off and told her my girlfriend's personal stuff was none of her business. She spluttered for a second, everyone else just staring at us bewildered before I just left. I talked to Layne on the way home and told her what happened, but said it was no big deal rn and refocused the conversation on what she needed to talk about. By the time I got home I had turned my phone on do not disturb and was facetiming Layne, so I didn't see the messages from my friends until today. Freya was pissed that I yelled at her, and two of our other friends, Toby (23M), and Clay (22M) shared the same sentiment of me embarrassing Freya by getting so angry at her when she was just worried about Layne. The rest of my friends were asking me if I was okay and siding with me. I just wanna know, despite my friends and Layne telling me Freya was totally weird for it, did I overreact? I'm starting to feel a bit guilty, I never *ever* yell like that.",

        "selftext": "So my (24f) mom is living with me since she got divorced a decade ago and has been struggling to manage things on her own since then. She lost her job in the summer and originally was looking a bunch for jobs but now isn\u2019t really doing that. But she met someone working for my apartment recently and they were talking a little bit for a few months. Now this talking was literally just seeing each other outside and chatting for a minute before going about their way.  Well she had him over for the first time on Christmas Eve 2024. We were find with that but requested he please not stay overnight since he\u2019s a stranger to us. She refused to kick him out and he stayed in our apartment the whole night. After that I tried to discuss with her some boundaries which I thought were reasonable. The only boundary I had was for him not to stay overnight until me and my sister got to know him better. She was mad at us for that and frequently argued with us and tried to plead with us but respected it.  But one night it was weird because she went to bed at 10pm then at 11 comes to get us saying he texted her wanting to come over and would we let him. We gently stated our boundary again and she said that she\u2019d already told him he could stay overnight. That hurt me a little but she ended up telling him to go back home. She was pissed though since he lives a few hours away and only comes to the apartment to work. But he could come over a couple nights a week and they\u2019d sleep together then he\u2019d leave before it got too late.  And some of why me and my sister requested this boundary is because our dad was notorious for having random people over when we\u2019d come for visitation as teenagers and not warning us beforehand.  And it\u2019s also weird because not once have they gone on a traditional date. They never go place together and my mom has no interest in it. It\u2019s only sex in her room a couple nights a week. And she\u2019s also been drinking a lot more since meeting him which concerns me because she\u2019s already jobless.  Final part of the story is that she says he just broke up with her because me and my sister wouldn\u2019t let him stay overnight. I tried to tell my mom we didn\u2019t mean never and just wanted to get to know him before a stranger sleeps in our apartment. I also think it\u2019s weird that he would rather not be with her than wait a little bit to sleep with her overnight. And keep in mind that they were seeing each other multiple times per week, just not overnight. My mom is pissed at me and begging me to let him stay overnight so she can get him back and giving me the whole spiel about how she has always taken care of us and this is how we repay her. Saying don\u2019t you care about my mental health and that he\u2019s the only thing that makes her happy.  This has been weighing on me for weeks so I really need to know\u2014 AITA for upholding my boundary?  ETA: adding a new section for where the guy lives to make it more clear since I shouldn\u2019t have buried it in long paragraphs. I don\u2019t want to reveal too much but he lives 3 hours away and his job involved traveling so he\u2019s down where we are on weekdays and doesn\u2019t have a permanent place up here.  ETA again: sorry guys I typed this all up in an emotional rush and probably didn\u2019t explain myself the best. Yeah of course we lived with my mom when I was 14 until college when I started paying most of the rent cause my mom was struggling. But me and my sister moved for a work opportunity a few years ago and our mom came with us since she didn\u2019t have much at our old place and couldn\u2019t pay rent alone so that\u2019s why we live together now. When the divorce happened we lost the house and have been living in apartments and people\u2019s basements since.  ",

        "selftext": "My (19f) friends and I all decided to go on a ski trip for a 12 days over winter break. We found a place to stay and all in all it was around $600 per person for the rental and we decided it was just easiest to have one person (me) put all the money upfront and just everyone pay me back before the actual trip, which everyone did. In my friend group we have a girl let\u2019s call Sarah. Sarah comes from a comfortable family and was even one of the people who suggested the trip and was one of the leading forces to finding the Air Bnb. Literally in the weeks leading up to the trip we were all fine, sending outfit ideas, restaurants to books etc. the Tuesday before we left (Saturday) Sarah starts sending texts to the gc like \u201cguys Jacob\u2019s (boyfriend) family is going to xxxxx next week\u201d basically sending us a LOT of details about where his family is going for winter vacation that we didn\u2019t really need to know. Then on Thursday (again we leave on Saturday) she texts the gc saying how she couldn\u2019t go because she had a family emergency, said her grandma had gotten admitted to the hospital . We were obviously bummed but family comes first and I told her that I would send her the money back that she sent towards the rental. We go on the trip and everything is ok until one of my friends who has Sarah\u2019s location on Life360 (roommates) sees that she\u2019s in a beach town and we put 2 and 2 together. We spend that night pissed and we call her out the next day where she admits everything. She had been last minute invited on her boyfriend\u2019s vacation and decided that she wanted to go to that instead but didn\u2019t know how to tell us. We were all obviously hurt and upset that she would choose a boy over us but at the end of the day she\u2019s a 19 year old girl so I guess it\u2019s just immaturity. The part that I\u2019m wondering if I\u2019m the asshole with is that after finding out that she voluntarily pulled out of the trip, I had told her I wouldn\u2019t be refunding her the $600 she had sent me for the rental. She pulled out so last minute that we couldn\u2019t find anything cheaper and I said I was ok just wasting that money because again I thought she was having a family emergency. After finding out that she wouldn\u2019t be getting that back she went insane and started calling me a bad friend and everything. My parents think I should send it back to her but I don\u2019t see why I should, she pulled out because of her boyfriend and expected us to all just absorb the costs?? ",

        "selftext": "So let me start off with I'm pretty bad at checking the details on my bank statements, but recently something wasn't right. So I went through every single one for the past year, and there were over 100 charges from PlayStation. I only had 4 purchases on my 2 PS accounts in a single year, so I panicked as someone had my cc info. In all, the total charges were around 1500. I contacted both of my siblings who's kids also have accounts and asked nicely if their kids may have purchased anything using my bank account before i make a dispute. Both said no, so I went ahead and called both PS and my bank. The bank was able to chargeback past few months and rest is under investigation. Well a few days later I get a frantic call from my teenage nephew who says his PS account was perma banned. I asked him if he was sure he didn't buy anything with a cc after I gave him a several hundred dollars PS giftcard for his birthday this summer to spend on stuff, he again denied. So I have his email logins and sure enough, it was purchases he made to his account. All the stuff he plays. Then he starts to say maybe he bought a few items here and there.  Now my sister is pissed at me. She says I must have added my cc info to buy him something at some point in time, and it was all my fault he was making purchases from my card. If it were her cc, she'd get an alert. Never that he may have taken my cc info, no. She doesn't want him to lose his account, and said she'll call PS to pay for it all. She said he always asks and she gets alerts and doesn't understand that I didn't, so I shouldn't blame him. I said well he knew he was spending someone else's money, so why is it my fault? And that he stopped asking her for permission to make purchases because no one stopped him. After that she said I was blaming her kid for everything. So AITA here? ##Edit:  Info:He is almost 15.I'm unsure of how he got my payment info. ##Update! After an intense argument, she was still denying he made the charges at all. I was finally able to show her each and every transaction (before I had only explained and she didn't believe me). After seeing the evidence, he finally fessed up. He claimed he thought it was HER card \ud83e\udd2a. She will be paying me for all the money he used on my account and will not be getting the PS5 back, until he works to pay it off. Even then she may not let him have it. He insists that he will be paying us both double for our troubles. But the real damage done here is the trust I have in both of them.",

        "selftext": "I (25F) am child-free so maybe there is some aspect of parenthood that I\u2019m missing here. My friend Stacy (26F) had her first baby about 9 months ago,  Hailey. Stacy and I had some tension brewing in our friendship since she was pregnant. In the past, my time and energy had been very much available to Stacy. At times I felt that she took advantage of my empathy and willingness to bend over backwards for her. She lived about an hour away, and was always in some form of drama or crisis. I drove up to be with her nearly every single weekend, and the times when I told her I couldn\u2019t for one reason or another, she would beg and usually guilt me with things like \u201cI\u2019m in such a dark place, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll do if I\u2019m alone, I really need this\u201d. She also did a lot of passive aggressive shutting down from conversation when she didn\u2019t get what she wanted, leading me to always give in and put my own needs aside. This went on for years. I grew tired of this pattern and started therapy, where I learned to set healthy boundaries, speak up, and prioritize myself when it was important. These changes led me to cut the weekends I spent with her in half. I was in the process of buying a house, starting a new job and masters program, on top of family issues. I knew that she saw the change in our friendship and wasn\u2019t happy about it, but thought that with time she would understand and adjust. She never did, and insinuated that I changed because I didn\u2019t support her pregnancy or because my partner was manipulating me into not spending time with her. I explained to her many times that this wasn\u2019t the case and that I am doing all I can to be there for her.  Things came to a head when I had a health scare. I told her about it, and the next day she tried to call me. I was on the phone with someone else and couldn\u2019t answer, but texted her immediately after to let her know and make sure that everything was okay. She once again got upset because I didn\u2019t answer right away, and I had had it. On the very rare occasion that I ask for support from her she had to make it about herself. I didn\u2019t usually call her out but this time I did. I told her I didn\u2019t understand why she had an attitude, she said \u201cthanks for making me cry\u201d and then didn\u2019t respond to me for over a month. Then, when she finally did, she didn\u2019t ask about my health. She didn\u2019t apologize or even bother explaining. She instead accused me of using her daughter as a pawn by not acknowledging her. She said that Hailey didn\u2019t deserve absolutely no effort just because her and I were in a fight, and that it was so messed up that I would add Hailey into the equation. I\u2019m so confused. Hailey had nothing to do with the fight, and Stacy was the one who had ignored me for over a month. What was I supposed to do in this scenario? I can\u2019t text a 9 month old or just show up at their house. I\u2019m genuinely lost, can someone please explain this to me? AITA? \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-(EDIT) Update:Thank you for all of the comments and advice! I especially appreciate the vulnerablility of those who shared their experiences from both sides of this situation. Stacy and I have been friends for a decade, and I have long speculated that Stacy\u2019s behavior stems from her past traumas and mental health. This is a huge reason I could never bring myself to abandon her or criticize the ways she copes with life, albeit unhealthy. Although I can empathize with her experience and care about her deeply, you all helped me see that with no end in sight, it\u2019s not a sustainable friendship for me to continue. I decidedly to be brutally honest with Stacy and of course, things ended in flames. I explained that her using Hailey to guilt trip me was manipulative and crossed the line, and that it is reflective of her behavior toward me throughout our friendship. I have done my best to be a good friend but find it impossible to meet the expectations she has for me that she doesn\u2019t even seem to apply to herself. I initially said I needed some distance from her, but her response was even worse than I imagined possible and the situation is now irredeemable. Some of my favorite lines were \u201cit is all about me and my family, get that through your f*cking head\u201d and \u201cif you don\u2019t want to be my doormat, don\u2019t let the door hit you on the way out.\u201d As well as letting me know what other people say about me behind my back and that I was meant to be Hailey\u2019s godmother but she couldn\u2019t bring herself to ask me because of what an absent friend I am. She has been blocked. I\u2019m devastated and relieved, and know I\u2019m not totally blameless for remaining silent and letting resentment build for so long. Thank you Reddit!",

        "selftext": "My best friend\u2014let's call her Elle\u2014and I have been close for 10ish years, and during that time, she's been in a couple of relationships but has been single for a few years now. Amongst our friends, Elle is the only unmarried one. She's made it clear that she's unhappy with being single, sincerely hopes to get into a serious relationship, and get married sooner rather than later. I can understand her frustrations, especially since she's the only single friend, wants kids someday, and so on.    About a month ago, Elle told me that she intends to be more proactive with dating this year and asked if I had anyone to introduce her to. Unfortunately, I don't, but another friend mentioned knowing a great guy (who I happen to have met before) who's single, and looking for something serious.  Elle was introduced (via text) to the guy, and they soon started talking on the phone. Elle says he has a lot of good attributes (e.g. very educated, high salary) but she finds him completely unattractive because they're the same height (he's 5'7 and she's 5'7) and because of his darker skin tone. I tried to convince her that his height and looks shouldn't take precedence over his personality, but this soon led to a major revelation on her dating standards that left me completely dumbfounded.   Elle told me that she's only interested in men who, in her words, is an 8 or better (looks-wise),  taller than her when she's wearing heels, of a certain complexion, ideally no beard, has advanced degrees, making over $100k/year, doesn't have kids, and is currently attending church every week or every other week.  But the big kicker that got me was that she insists that she's unwilling to date a man (like...go out on dates) who won't commit to waiting until marriage for sex. Yes, she's religious but she's not a virign and has had sex in all past relationships.    According to Elle, this is a conversation that should be had before even the first date, and if the guy isn't firmly agreeing, it's a no-go. When I challenged her thoughts and logic on this, she got increasingly upset.   I told her that I think she's asking for a very tall order, making dating harder than it should be. I'm not saying she should compromise on her religious values, but I am trying to tell her that she should be more open-minded about her criteria because she's looking for a one in a million guy, while also prematurely shutting down and shutting out some potentially great guys because of their income and/or height.    Elle is now furious at me and says I'm not being a supportive friend. She says that I don't understand her faith and am being something of a Debbie Downer. AITA?",

We've been arguing frequently due to misunderstandings. I asked her parents if I could fly up to see her for her birthday, and they paid for the tickets despite my offer to cover it myself. However, Sarah told me she planned to spend most of her time on the phone with her boyfriend and might kick me out of her room. This made me reconsider the trip, as I wanted to visit her, not just be a third wheel. After a misunderstanding, she clarified that she would call him during downtime and spend holidays with him, which seemed fair. We hung up, but then her boyfriend texted me (he already had my number) about Sarah having a bad day and said my uncertainty about visiting made it worse. I felt this was inappropriate and told him to mind his business. Sarah then told me I couldn't speak to him that way and that she had given him permission to text me the message.  I was shocked and explained that he crossed a boundary. She responded that her business was his, which made me feel disrespected. I had her parents cancel my tickets, but I expressed gratitude for their support. I felt uncomfortable visiting, especially with the potential for further arguments and disrespect for my boundaries. Sarah defended her boyfriend, saying he was just trying to help and that she really wanted me there for her birthday. She was upset that I won\u2019t be there, expressing that it hurt her deeply, especially since she had fought her dad for months to be able to visit me (though he ultimately said no). I reminded her that I had to remind her about my own birthday during a busy time when she was moving. She said it will take a long time for her to get over the hurt of me choosing not to visit.  I think I might be the asshole because at the end of the day it is her 18th birthday and I don\u2019t want her to hold this over my head.   I don\u2019t want to be in an environment where I might argue again, and I\u2019d rather focus on my own life and obligations. Given the situation, do you think I did anything wrong? AITA for canceling my trip to see my best friend for her 18th birthday? (Edit: they both met because I introduced them. He and I ran gaming channels and he messaged me to collaborate.

        "selftext": "I have a roommate who pays me about 90% of half the rent\u2014so if the total rent is $1,600, they contribute around $700. I cover the rest, along with water, gas, internet, and electricity, because I earn more than they do. When they first moved in, I felt sorry for them because they were leaving an abusive situation. It\u2019s been a little over a year since they moved into my guest room, and overall, it hasn\u2019t been too bad. However, when they moved in, I had some of my belongings in the closet\u2014primarily books. The room is fully furnished with my furniture, including a large bed that takes up a lot of space, a heavy bookshelf, and around 500 books stored in 5\u20136 boxes and two large bags. I always intended to go through them, pick out my favorites, and donate or sell the rest, but due to my ADHD and object impermanence, I kept pushing it off. In the long run, I envisioned turning the room into a closet/library after they moved out since I prefer having my clothes visible rather than stored away. Last year, I came home to find my bookshelf outside by the dumpsters. I immediately told my roommate to put it back in the room because they had no right to throw away my belongings. If they had asked, I would have found another place for it, but I was so frustrated that I insisted they return it to the room without offering an alternative solution. Fast forward to now: I recently hired someone to help clean my apartment when work gets too busy. They offered to organize my cabinets, which reminded me to finally sort through my books\u2014only to be told that my roommate had thrown them all away months ago. Over 500 books\u2014hardcover, paperback, large, small, books I had kept since middle school\u2014just gone. They never asked, never mentioned feeling uncomfortable with them in the closet, never gave me a chance to move them. They simply decided to discard decades of my history without my permission. I was so upset that I haven\u2019t spoken to them in over a week. It\u2019s not just about the books\u2014it\u2019s about the complete lack of respect for my things. My first instinct is to kick them out (yes, I understand the legal complexities of tenancy and eviction), but instead, I\u2019ve decided that I no longer want to cover the bulk of the bills. I\u2019ve drafted a document that evenly splits all household expenses, which will increase their contribution by at least $500. WIBTA if I taped it to their door? This isn\u2019t the arrangement we originally agreed upon when they moved in, but at this point, I feel that if they can blatantly disrespect my belongings, they no longer deserve my generosity. ",

For a few years we didn't get to see each other much because we went to college on opposite sides of the country, but I moved to her city last year so we really got to catch up with each other.  Hayley will be turning 25 in a week so we - along with some other friends - started planning her birthday party a while ago. She wanted to have a rather big party so that she could invite all of her friends groups, but we couldn't find anywhere to have it and she lives in a small apartment. I on the other hand have a house, it's not that big but it's big enough to host the party. So our friends started bringing it up and said that we could throw the party at my house.  I was fine with that. I did find it kinda weird that they were the one to bring it up, because I personally wouldn't suggest throwing a party in someone else's house unless they were the one to suggest it, but it didn't really matter. So I said yes, my only conditions were that the party didn't turn into chaos, that no one got too drunk, and that they helped me clean up the next day. Everyone was fine with that so we agreed on it.  Yesterday, Hayley sent me a text to tell me how many people would be there. That's when she asked me if I could get my cat out of the house for the night, because one of her friends from college is allergic. I told her that I didn't have anywhere else to leave him, but that I could make sure that he stayed upstairs while we were downstairs. I also told her that my cat is very shy and easily scared so there's no way he'd get close to her friend.  She then told me that I could just leave him with my parents and then go back to get him the next day. My parent's house is about an hour and a half drive and there's just no way I'd drive a total of 6 hours in one weekend. I told her that it really wasn't possible for me to leave him with my parents but that he would be locked upstairs and I'd deep clean the house to make sure there's no cat hair anywhere. I also told her that she should've told me earlier and I could've found another solution, but now the party is in less than a week.   She told me that I wasn't being helpful and that I was ruining her party, and she's been bitching about me to a lot of our mutual friends. I told her that I had no obligation to let her do the party at my house and I kindly accepted to do so, so the least she could do was to be grateful. She hasn't replied since. Most of our friends agree with me, but I also feel a bit guilty. I don't know if I'm in the wrong here and I don't know what else I can do.  ",

        "selftext": "My (23M) cousin (30M) and his GF (32F) recently had to move out of their place after his girlfriend lost her job. My cousin has been unemployed for quite some time due to his mental health, which is a sore subject for him (this will be relevant later). His GF has been job searching, but it\u2019s a long process and they need somewhere to stay in the meantime, so they\u2019ve been staying with me and my roommate (22M).\u00a0 I didn\u2019t love this arrangement in the first place since we have a two-bedroom apartment and I\u2019ve needed to move into my roommate\u2019s room to make space, but it\u2019s family and my roommate says he doesn\u2019t mind having me in his room for now (plus my aunt is paying us) so whatever.\u00a0 The problem is that my cousin and his GF have insisted on bringing their emotional support dog with them (not a service dog). It\u2019s technically fine in terms of our lease and I don\u2019t mind dogs in general so at first I said OK, but this thing has been a nightmare. It\u2019s loud, pees on our floors, and it chewed up one of our couch pillows. My cousin and his GF think this behavior is hysterical and endearing, but every time my roommate and I tried to bring up that we\u2019d rather they find somewhere else for their dog, they go on and on about how they can\u2019t possibly part with their \u201cfur baby\u201d and just will not hear it. This all kind of culminated last night because my roommate had an important presentation this morning so he tried to go to bed early last night, but the dog would not stop barking. My cousin and his GF were all like \u201cawww she wants to play\u201d but my roommate and I were pretty annoyed. I told my cousin that this arrangement was not working and that he needed to find somewhere else to put the dog. He told me again that it\u2019s their \u201cfur baby\u201d, and his GF started getting really upset and telling me we were making the dog feel unwelcome and it was like asking them to part with their child. I told them that the dog is not a baby and that they need to take responsibility for it or find somewhere else for the three of them to stay. He reminded me that he needs the dog for emotional support and that his GF is trying to find a job and they have nowhere to go until then. Partially out of anger, I told him that his emotional support needs weren\u2019t my problem and that maybe he should try getting a job too. I know he\u2019s had a rough time with his mental health and how that impacts employment so I think those two statements put together cut a little deeper than I intended, and he hasn\u2019t been talking to me today and his girlfriend called me an ableist for what I said. My aunt texted me this morning that my cousin and his GF plan on moving out this weekend with their dog and that I was way too harsh with him. I do understand why the comment had that effect on them and I feel bad for that, but it finally got the dog out of our place after we\u2019ve been trying the gentler approach so I don\u2019t really know what else I could\u2019ve done.

        "selftext": "Some background: I (29F) used to know Tom (30M) years ago. We were acquaintances as teenagers, and though we briefly dated at 16, it wasn\u2019t serious, and we stayed on neutral terms whenever we ran into each other. A few years later, when we were in our early twenties, I bumped into him at a nightclub, and he introduced me to his then-girlfriend, Alex. From the moment we met, Alex was noticeably cold toward me she barely spoke, made passive-aggressive comments about my appearance, and created an uncomfortable tension. Sensing the awkwardness, I made my exit. Tom later messaged me to apologize for how she acted, but I brushed it off. I didn\u2019t think much of it, as we weren\u2019t close anyway. Since then, I\u2019ve occasionally run into them at different social events, and Alex\u2019s attitude toward me has never changed. She has made snide remarks in passing, whispered about me to others while I was nearby, and has generally gone out of her way to be hostile anytime we\u2019re in the same space. I\u2019ve always ignored it because, as far as I was concerned, whatever problem she had with me wasn\u2019t my issue. Now to last weekend, I was out with some friends when I saw Alex and Tom at the same venue. Tom came over to say hello and make small talk, and almost immediately, Alex stormed over. Without even greeting me, she shoved her ring in my face and made a pointed comment about how I \u201cdefinitely couldn\u2019t have him now.\u201d I laughed and told her I never wanted him in the first place, but I was happy for them. That only made things worse. She started raising her voice, accusing me of trying to get attention for years, making assumptions about me, and throwing out personal insults. When she finally finished, I asked if she was done and told her that I had never done any of the things she was accusing me of. I also made it clear that I didn\u2019t care about her or Tom and, most importantly, that she needed to stop making her personal insecurities my problem. She looked like she was about to respond, so I added that she also needed to stop being jealous of me because there was no reason for it. At that point, she excused herself and left the room, with Tom following after her. Before he left, he told me I didn\u2019t need to say all that. My friends thought my response was blunt but justified, while some mutuals later told me I was too harsh and should have been more understanding because she\u2019s obviously insecure. Now, I\u2019m wondering was I too harsh?",

        "selftext": "I (26F) lost my mother to cancer when I was 8 and have always had an absent father. I only found out who he was when I was 13 and even then he did not want custody of me forcing me to stay in the foster system until I was 18. Over my whole life I have had about 5 conversations with him give or take- he is like a stranger to me. He appears once in a blue moon to ask for money or something along those lines. It doesn't really bother me anymore, I've just learnt to accept it now but i don't like talking about it so to avoid that conversation with people i usually just say both my parents are dead. This leads me to a year and a half ago when I had just started dating my boyfriend (25M) and like usual I had just told him my parents were dead but the other day my dad showed up at my door (I still don't know how he knows where I live) and asked for 100 dollars except my boyfriend was there and he obviously found out my dad was not dead. This lead to a long conversation with him that night where I explained the whole situation. He said this was a breach of trust between us since I lied about my dad and that he needed some space to rethink our relationship but he doesn't think he will leave me. I feel so shitty and that I should have told him earlier but I am going to be honest I just didn't think. So AITA? UPDATE: my boyfriend texted me 5 mins ago asking to talk so we are going to have a full in depth conversation tomorrow after work and I'll update again then :)   UPDATE 2 (last update): Before I get to the update I would like clear things up. 1. I have only given money to my dad once when I was still desperate for his love and acceptance but he did not get any money this time. 2. Despite his confusion my bf stepped in to defend me and get my dad to leave and it was only after my dad left he asked me about it Now onto the update. My boyfriend told me that all the sudden information along with the knowledge I hadn't told him the truth was very overwhelming and he just needed some space to not say the wrong thing. He also said that he got why I lied initially and he wasn't mad that I lied more hurt that I felt like I couldn't tell him about it. He also mentioned that he couldn't be there for me if he didn't know what was going on. The conversation ended in tears and it is the most vulnerable I have been in front of someone. He was very understanding and we have decided to draw a line in the sand and 'start again' if that makes sense. I have also looked into therapy for my childhood trauma and all in all I am using this as an opportunity to better myself and heal fully. Thank you for all your kind comments :)",

        "selftext": "ETA:My husband doesn\u2019t do gifts, his family was never big on gifts and it shows.  He requested I send links to things I want because he isn\u2019t creative to know what I want. He likes when I just tell him things \u2014 clear and direct. If I do not ask for a gift (birthday, Christmas, etc) I\u2019m not receiving anything. This happened in 2024. He asked me to pick an engagement ring out because he just couldn\u2019t decide. He TOLD ME HE WOULD BUY THIS NECKLACE 2 years ago, and I\u2019ve waited this long. I sent links, photos, we have walked through pandora together to see what it is I wanted. We are in couples counseling to work on communication and putting in effort since he struggles with it. He\u2019s well aware he struggles with this. So for everyone telling me to just buy it myself, it defeats the purpose of him saying he will buy it and requesting links to what I want. I thought about buying it myself for quite a while, but I have waited patiently for him to put in the effort and keep his word.  My husband (28m) and I(29f) have been married nearly a year now, and our anniversary is coming up soon. Ever since we have dated I have expressed how I\u2019d love a dainty initial necklace with the letter d to wear daily. Corny? Sure, but I love it. Anyway\u2026after a year of not receiving the necklace I started showing him pictures on Etsy of the ones I love (small gold plates with a lower case d in typewriter font \u2014 all of them were this font and style) we even walked through pandora to the custom engraved section and how he could write it and that would be very precious and meaningful to me. He thought it was neat and this whole time I thought he was absorbing what I was saying and listening. All he absorbed was the word \u2018dainty\u2019 apparently. This comes down to this morning. He expressed he was bored at work (night shift and he works for weeks at a time 1000 miles away from me). And this morning he bought a small (in size) but very thick bulky d necklace is some kind of frilly cursive that doesn\u2019t even look like a d. We share an email and I had literally opened it to check our daily emails like I do daily and it refreshed and there was the purchase. I texted him and expressed that it\u2019s absolutely nothing like I\u2019ve expressed for years. I\u2019ve waited this long for a necklace \u2014 I want to actually like and wear it. He told me I wanted dainty and that it is dainty, and I tried to explain dainty and delicate doesn\u2019t just mean in size and he googled it sent me the definition of dainty. I told him it was absolutely nothing like I\u2019ve shown him for years and to just cancel the order. Naturally this makes me ungrateful in his eyes. AITAH?",

I told them I will give them the money if they called up all the people they 'lent' money to and recovered at least half of what they gave away. They called me an AH and said I was going to hell.

        "selftext": "I, 26 F, am very punctual and value being on time. I don\u2019t understand why we agree on a time, if one always fails to come at that specified time. I have a friend, who i will call Lara (25F), and she unfortunately has a problem with punctuality. She has a tendency to be at least 20 minutes late, but there have been times where she has even been 40-50 minutes late. This is not due to traffic, but because she starts getting ready late and goes out of the house 5 minutes before our agreed time if not later. I have told her multiple times that i do not appreciate it. For example, I have sat alone in a restaurant for half an hour to make sure we did not lose the reservation. And this is just one of the situations which leave me frustrated. Other than that, she is a good friend and we have Lots of fun hangouts together. Well yesterday evening it was very cold and windy outside (1 Degree Celsius), and we had planned to meet in the city centre and go for food and drinks afterwards. I had texted her to remind her to leave her house on time. It takes me around 40 minutes to get there, so I cannot spontaneously just exit the house and be there, I have to plan my time. When I arrived, I was right on time (as opposed 10 minutes earlier, because I know it\u2019s useless with her anyway) and I started waiting. After around 30 minutes I lost my patience, texted her to forget it and just left. I was cold and in a bad mood, especially because she told me that she would be there \u201cright away\u201d. She apparently was there 15 minutes later and called me upset, that I don\u2019t understand how she is and I am being a bad friend. That I should not make plans if I am not okay with waiting, which I did not agree with. Still, I have never left like this before and I feel guilty for leaving her like this. Was I the asshole? Little update I have left in the comments: She called me a few hours ago, and we talked for a bit. She apologized for insulting me, ignoring my messages AND for being late this time. She sounded like she really regretted it, but I was a bit bitter about the fact that I had to take it this far for her to wake up. I did not talk about meeting up again, as I just want to let it sink in a bit more and not just two days. And I think afterwards I will use one of the suggestions that said to meet in a cafe and give her a range, such as \u201cI will be here from 15 to 15:30\u201d, and see how that works out. I truly don\u2019t want to lose her and I was sorry to hear her like this, but she hurt me first and she needs to understand that too",

However, I said I will not be doing so, and will be sticking with my choice, which upset her.

        "selftext": "I (17F) am turning 18 in July. Because of this, I'm already starting to prepare what I'm going to take with me when I move out, even though that likely won't be a while because I also plan to move in with 2 of my close friends and we need to arrange where we'll be living first. Some things I definitely want to take with me when I move out are my gaming consoles. An Xbox 360, an Xbox One S, and a Playstation 4, all of which were given to me as birthday or Christmas presents. Because they were given to me specifically, I think it's only fair that I get to take them with me when I move out. However my mother doesn't seem to think so. My mother believes that I can only take one console with me, the ps4, and leave both Xbox consoles with them. Her justification for it is that she and my sister (5) won't have anything if I take all the consoles. She also said that it's a thing that when you get a new console the older one is passed down as a family console. I thought this was completely stupid, because they were given to me as gifts, and now she just expects me to leave 2 of them behind just so they can actually have gaming consoles. I'd like to add that I've spent my own gift money on both the ps4 AND xbox one to buy games and other things for certain games, but she's also bought quite a bit of stuff on the xbox too (DLCs for the Sims 4 mainly). That's another reason why she doesn't want me to take the xbox one, because she spent money on it herself. I feel like she's trying to just guilt trip me, but I need to know if I'm really in the wrong for wanting to take things that were given to me with me when I move out. WIBTA? Edit to add: I feel like I should have pointed this out originally, but my mother is acting like there would be absolutely no at home gaming consoles left in the house when that isn't the case at all. We have an old gamecube that has quite a few games too, all it needs is to get new cords to plug in to the tv and then the power button needs to be fixed because it's stuck pressed down Edit 2: since a lot of people are bringing up visiting my family when I move out and leaving one console there for them and switching the consoles out, that wouldn't be an option, if I leave a console it's gone for good. My parents haven't been the best people my whole life for more serious issues I didn't feel the need to go into before, but these things are making me decide to go no contact with my father and limited contact with my mother.",

        "selftext": "I (26F) moved into an apartment in Florida with my college bestie (21F). I let her pick her room, so she took the master with an en-suite, and I got the smaller one. I also furnished most of the place, including putting a 75\u201d TV in the living room. A few months in, I got pregnant and decided to go home to give birth, but I kept paying rent since I planned to return. Before leaving, I moved my TV into my locked bedroom. She could still use everything else, but I did this because she gets careless when high or drunk\u2014leaving keys in the door, passing out randomly, etc. I didn\u2019t want my things stolen or damaged. About a month later, she mentioned her brother was staying over. He was cool, so I had no issue with it. I was actually thinking of offering him my room since he was only staying a few days. But on FaceTime, I noticed a big TV in the background. I asked, \u201cOh, you got a new TV?\u201d She said no. \u201cDid he bring one?\u201d Again, no. Then she pans the camera and says, \u201cOh, we took yours out of your room. It just goes with the aesthetics.\u201d I said, \u201cBut my room was locked?\u201d She just shrugged. \u201cI used a knife to get in.\u201d Like it was nothing. I blacked out, cussed her out, and ended the call. Then I asked my maintenance friend from the complex to check things out. It wasn\u2019t just my TV\u2014my room was messy, my locked bathroom had been broken into, and both she and her brother had been wearing my clothes. I was livid. I called her, and she finally answered when I threatened legal action. She said it was selfish of me to put the TV in my room because they had nothing to use. Mind you, we both had TVs in our bedrooms. At that point, I was done. I had my sister and a friend clear out my stuff while she was at work. Anything we bought together, I sent her half the money for\u2014including the dining table, even though I was being petty when I took it. I also disconnected the electricity (didn\u2019t want her running up a spite bill) and stopped paying rent. Unfortunately, I lost the baby and returned earlier than planned. When I got back, the apartment was trashed. She had moved out, stopped paying rent, and now the delinquency is on both our credit reports. Years of friendship gone, just like that. No apology, no accountability, no nothing. Just one FaceTime call, and that was it. AITA for handling it this way? Should I have kept paying rent since moving in together was my idea?",

        "selftext": "Hello Reddit universe, first post. Let\u2019s get into it. I (38 M) have a girlfriend (Bonni) with a 13-year old son, and they live in a house with her sister. Her sister has a boyfriend, Dude, who comes around but doesn\u2019t live there. He normally carries a pistol on him. I haven\u2019t known him long, but he seems like a nice guy and we typically get along. He has seemed responsible with his guns which I appreciate, especially with kids around. I\u2019ve been around firearms my whole life and take gun safety seriously. The other night Bonni, her son and I get home to an empty house and as we are getting ready for dinner, she notices a small fanny pack on the kitchen table that doesn\u2019t belong to us. She moves it, notices it\u2019s heavy and asks me if I think there\u2019s gun in there. She handed it over and it was pretty obvious that\u2019s what it was. Knowing he likes to practice concealed carry, I wondered if it was loaded and ready to fire. So I unzipped the bag and took a look. I wanted to make sure Dude at least left it in relatively \u2018safe\u2019 condition. Thought about just moving it, but I really wanted to know the exact situation that was left unattended on the kitchen table.  What I found was a loaded Glock 9mm with a round in the chamber and ready to fire. It was holstered, but being a Glock, there is no traditional \u2018safety\u2019 on the gun and anyone could just pull it out and fire off a round. So I dropped out the magazine, cleared the round from the chamber, and put it back in his bag in a much safer condition than I found it.  I then text him telling him I did that, and let\u2019s make sure that doesn\u2019t happen again. He then calls me NOT to apologize, but to tell me how pissed off he is that I violated his privacy. A day later thought he\u2019d come to his senses but I hear that he is still livid and that I should apologize, although I have not heard a single bit of remorse or apology from him to Bonni for leaving an unsecured, loaded gun sitting out for anyone to get at.  In my mind, the safety of everyone in the house, especially the kid, is priority #1 and should far outweigh anyone\u2019s feelings of privacy violation. No, I wouldn\u2019t be stoked if someone in general decided to open and look in my bag. But if I were to make the huge mistake of leaving a loaded gun in a common area where a kid lives, if anything I\u2019d hope that someone responsible would do the same thing I did, make the situation safer, and help prevent any chance of my mistake becoming something much worse.  AITA for prioritizing this safety concern over Dude\u2019s privacy? UPDATE: To be fair I missed a detail - turns out he had given the gun to Bonni\u2019s sister to take with them to lock up, and she left it on the table on accident. ",

        "selftext": "I'm gonna try to keep this as short and sweet as I can because I just need to know if I really fucked up. For backstory, I, (21F) have a best friend Ali (21F), and we've been best friends since ninth grade. We're complete open books with each other, and we've, until now, never judged. I always wanted her to feel safe to talk to me about anything, and I hoped she felt the same about me. We both go to the same uni and room together. So, around eight almost nine months ago (we had been friends since I started uni), I got together with my girlfriend Freddie (22F), and she's been my first love. It's been so incredible being with her, she is such an angel that just gets me on every single level. Biiiig oversharing time, but losing my virginity has always been something that really scared me, in the sense of trusting someone with my body like that. No trauma or anything, just scared, but I finally got there with Freddie a few nights ago. She was so loving and after we were done I just cried out happy tears. I was so just ecstatic that I got to do that with someone I love so much, and Freddie just hugged me tight and was so kind about it. I told Ali about this the day after and since them she keeps making jokes about me being a big big cry baby and will just mock cry at me randomly when we see each other. I just rolled my eyes at her and tried to just bear it, because no way was I letting her ruin that experience for me. Last night we were at a party together and she absolutely crossed the line. First, she was just making wah wah noises at me, but then she made a gross joke about Freddie having a 'thing' for crying. I just yelled at her to shut up because I'm so fucking sick of it. It's just not funny. She looked all shocked and I just called Freddie and asked her to pick me up. I've been at her apartment off-campus since, and Ali and some of our friends that witnessed it are getting upset with me and telling me to stop being so sensitive. I haven't answered any texts yet, and Freddie's telling me I did nothing wrong with removing myself from the situation, but I'm still so conflicted. \u2014\u2014\u2014UPDATE Um so the AITA mods wouldnt let me post the update as a stand alone so I\u2019m just gonna paste it here LMFAO.  I'm not sure if anyone cares for an update but I'm gonna post one anyways LOL! I got much good advice on my last post, but against what multiple people were saying, I decided to talk to Ali. We've been friends for long, and frankly, this is real life. I'm not gonna cut her off without even speaking to her first. Also, shoutout to the person who said crying after sex was a sapphic rite of passion, my girlfriend thinks you're hilarious!! Anyways, I messaged Ali and told her to meet me at the late night coffee shop we frequent, and she answered yes. I asked Freddie if she could wait outside in the car for me in case things go south, which she said of course to. I was nervous, and Ali was already there by the time we pulled up. She looked nervous too, but also somehow pissed off?? I sat down and she immediately asked me what the hell was wrong with me completely icing her out like that. I kept myself calm then, despite my rising anger. I told her how insane it was that she thinks she's the victim here, she taunted me for days over something she knew what really important to me, and then at the crest of it all she made a downright disgusting joke about my girlfriend. I told her if she didn't explain exactly why she thought any of that was remotely okay, there was zero chance of us ever being friends again. She shut her mouth fast, and looked kind of conflicted before she just blurted out some actual Wattpad shit I'd read when I was thirteen, I'm just pissed off because it should've been me making you cry like that. Uhhhh?? She pretty much just word vomited about how jealous she is of Freddie and that she's liked me since grade 12, when I got hot (UH?). Safe to say, I don't think I've ever been angrier. I can't remember well what I said, I was just\u00a0*so angry.*\u00a0I told her something about how bizarre she sounds, that I can't believe she would never tell me and just be a total bitch. I got too loud when telling her I was switching dorms, when an employee asked me to leave. Ali tried to follow me out but I told her to fuck off and drove away with a very concerned Freddie. I blocked her on our way home. I told our friends that witnessed the party, and also the ones who weren't there (just in case they were told something) the real story, and they all apologized to me. To be fair, they were all pretty wasted at the time of the incident, and probably didn't really realize exactly what was going on. They agreed to cut Ali out of the group, and that's just where we are now. I'm keeping the ones who berated me at arms length, just for my own sanity right now. Ali's tried to approach me a few times, but it's when I've been with people who know, so they helped me get rid of her quick. I'm still very hurt and weirded out, but I luckily have Freddie and good friends to keep me upright. Anyways, thank you so much for all the support on the last post, and have a good night!",

        "selftext": "My (35F) little sister (31F) gave birth to her second child late Dec '24. She asked me to be her 2nd birth partner to support her and her husband and I was stoked to agree. Mom thought it was great too. Some background on my parents (65F, 71M). Mom loves to play the victim. We used to be close, but I don't like playing her therapist anymore. My dad was a workaholic with zero emotional regulation and quick to anger.  Jump to Dec. It was the most amazing and emotional experience to help my sis and she has a calm, natural birth. They made baby's middle name my first name, total honour. I tried leaving to avoid overstaying but my sister wanted me to stay at the hospital overnight to help her while her husband went back home to their toddler, so I did. It was super special caring for her.  In the lead up my sis told my parents she's not sure if she wants them visiting the hospital or when they first get home. She also sets the don't come if you're sick and no kissing baby rule. They're miffed. Next morning Mom messages me and invites her and dad to have a coffee at the hospital. I say I'll come to our family home but she says no because they are in the middle of packing to move to their property 3 hrs away. When we meet, my dad is coughing/sick and he goes so we are going up to meet the baby now? I say no that's not the plan and you can't meet baby if you are sick. Dad starts yelling in the middle of the hospital cafe saying yes he can because baby already has an immunity from my sister and heaps of babies are born in disgusting conditions around the world. He then accuses me of subterfuge for being at the birth. He won't stop yelling and demanding to go up to the ward. I tell him he doesn't have my sister's permission and she needs to know he's unwell. My Mom is all I told you not to say anything. Dad keeps escalating. I tell dad I'd rather he be NC with me than I go against my sister's boundaries when she's so vulnerable after birth. He carries on about my conniving subterfuge and manipulation I think for not saying I was at the birth. I then told Dad that my sister asked me 6 months ago, sis had told mom multiple times since and sis told Mom yesterday I was on my way. Dad looked confused and mum says \u201cI must have forgot\u201d. I went back to the ward without them, warned my sister, said goodbye and made a hasty exit to drive back home, crying the whole way. My sis ended up letting my parents come into the ward though Dad wasn't allowed near the baby...I then find out they drove back to their property the next day. so it was zero about supporting my sister and her husband. I haven't spoken to my parents since. AITA? tldr: I was my sister's birth partner, my boomer parents lost their shit and accused me of deceit and subterfuge.",

        "selftext": "I (28M) am from the Philippines and have been in a bit of a financial bind recently, trying to manage our family\u2019s finances as best I can. My wife (28F) and I have two kids\u2014a 7-year-old son and a daughter who will be turning 1 soon. I\u2019m the only one working, and I earn about $850 a month. After paying bills and groceries, money is tight. In January, I received a total of $828. I paid $234 in bills in total and gave my wife $144 to budget for the first two weeks. The rest, I kept as savings for our daughter\u2019s birthday, with the plan to add more in the upcoming paychecks. Unfortunately, we didn\u2019t manage the $144 well, and by the next paycheck, we were down to $54 in savings. On January 10th, I noticed my wife only had $28 left, and by the 12th, she was down to just $5. When I asked how that happened, she got upset but said not to worry because it was all spent on us. At this point, I had to dip into the savings I set aside for our daughter\u2019s birthday to cover expenses. Fast forward to later in the month, and I decided to take control of the finances for the next paycheck. I told my wife I would be handling the money for the next two paychecks so I could keep track of everything. I told her she could still take money from my wallet, but she would have to let me know how much and what it was for. She got upset, saying I don\u2019t trust her and that I was being selfish. A few days later, I discovered she was planning to pawn her necklace to help her sister pay off her debt. I tried to open up a conversation by asking about her sister\u2019s situation, hoping she would tell me about the necklace. Eventually, I directly asked if she planned to pawn it to help her sister, and she admitted it. I told her I was against it because we were already in a tough spot financially, and we needed the necklace for our daughter\u2019s birthday. That led to an argument, and she said she\u2019d rather not celebrate our daughter\u2019s birthday than not help her sister. I tried to explain that it\u2019s okay to help others, but it can\u2019t come at the cost of our own financial stability. She became really angry and said she wasn\u2019t willing to understand or give me a chance to explain. She accused me of not trusting her and being selfish, and we\u2019ve been at odds since then. On top of all this, she\u2019s been acting childish in this situation. She insists on not touching our shared money, which we are supposed to spend as part of our budget, but then complains about having it difficult. When I called her out on this behavior, I made it very clear that she needs to grow up and be more responsible. I\u2019ve been feeling hurt because I feel like I made my plans clear and that I\u2019m just trying to keep us financially stable. AITA for being strict about managing our money and not allowing my wife to pawn the necklace to help her sister?",

        "selftext": "Throwaway account. My house is for sale. It\u2019s being sold due to my marriage unexpectedly breaking down after I found out my husband - \u201cAdam\u201d - had been having a year long affair and when caught, moved out. Adam has been a real POS in the aftermath - very justified, hostile and mean. It\u2019s been awful. Did I mention we have two kids? They are 3 and 1. I was pregnant the entire time he cheated.  I digress. The house is in my name and is operating under a private sale. And right now there are a few parties competing for it. I\u2019ll sell it in the next 72 hours to clear our debts.  Here\u2019s the kicker: his best friend (his best man) and his wife want to buy it. But they didn\u2019t tell me. They had the estate agent tell me. These are people who i have called friends for a long time, but when this affair broke out, they were sympathetic but then vanished in the last 6 months. Ghosted me and the children - would be cordial when I ran into them, and I would be too - but other than that, no support. Now they are in a tight race with others to buy it and I find the entire scenario weird and deeply awkward. Why wouldn\u2019t they just call and tell me beforehand?! Why get the agent to tell me? There\u2019s better ways to go about this. They aren\u2019t bad people. Just awkward.This is so shitty and emotional. But on a logical front, sell this damn house. So the offers are coming in and they\u2019re getting pretty tight money wise and similar in terms. I told the agent that someone needs to differentiate and make a bigger offer so that I\u2019m not splitting hairs. I am reluctant to sell to them as it\u2019s so weird and awkward. I feel like they\u2019re dancing on the grave a bit. I really want these other bidders I don\u2019t know to get it because I don\u2019t want to make a decision. I don\u2019t really see these friends anymore - my husband does - and I can see it for what it is, despite it being really disappointing by them.  Would I be the asshole if I went with these other people if the offers and terms were practically the same?  Edit: edited for paragraph breaks! Update (if interested) For those who commented or upvoted my post, thank you for your supportive comments and advice. I got a high offer, it's close to $3m, and it's from my ex's best friend and his wife. Fine. Obviously awkward and uncomfortable as hell, but fine, that's an incredible price and more money than I dreamed of this house fetching. It clears our mortgages and there's cash leftover. The other buyers walk. I tell the agent: yes - sold. Let me know when the signed contracts come through.But... I don't get a contract. The agent and I are on the phone all the time. He is communicating with me around the clock and it is reassuring. But I tell him I have a bad feeling, why don't I have a contract? He tells me that it's all in hand, they are finalising some smaller details, it will come through shortly.And that's when the calls and messages start. The husband - let's call him Paul - is trying to reach out. He wants to speak. I avoid his calls and tell him I'm busy with the kids, any q's regarding the sale direct through to agent, l'm ready to sign. Paul says, no concerns commercially, we want to check if you're ok, call me. My agent says - you're right to have a bad feeling, they won't sign until you say you are ok with this sale. He says in 20 years of real estate he's never heard of such a thing. I tell the agent this is emotional blackmall. He says he has tried everything to convince them but they insist on me saying it's ok. I feel shaky and sick. It's at this point that I very much can see that they are having a crisis of conscience. They have suddenly realised the optics aren't  great around this. They know that this will invite a lot of judgement... and when it comes they need to have some good 'spin' on it. I can picture them saying, how did she [me] feel about it? She was fine - she was just so relieved that another family was moving into it. Naturally we checked on her!. I find all of this so gross. So l'm over a barrel. I'm about to lose $3m if I don't tell them what they want to hear. It's too risky to call their bluff. I can't believe they let it get to this point and then throw this emotional condition into a commercial transaction. So I tell them what they want to hear only via text - so l don't have to speak to them. This forced message apologises that I have been avoiding their calls as l've been overwhelmed with selling the house and I'm cool with it. I feel... grubby. I don't lie, I really don't. But this is for my children. I send the text and within an hour my inbox gets the contract. I sign it. I receive a text from each of them thanking me and that my children and I are important to them and they would never have signed unless I was ok with it. Now I am waiting for the cooling off period to pass. Settlement isn't for 4 months. If they bail between now and then, and of course they could, they would forfeit their $500k deposit. ",

        "selftext": "Okay so I (29M) started college when I was 17. Because of my family\u2019s income and general status I was not granted much financial aid for college. Because I have 2 younger siblings, and my parents had other financial responsibilities, my parents could not afford to pay out-of-pocket for my undergrad and I was not granted nearly enough in personal loans. The school my parents and I agreed on is a private university, and tuition was high.  Because of the cost of the college, personal loans were taken out in my name, and my parents took out Parent Plus Loans in their name. Now I work full-time and my loans are on an income-driven repayment plan. I am easily able to manage my monthly payments on those (the ones in my name). However, my issue is that my parents are demanding monthly payments for the ParentPlus Loans taken out in their names. Their stance is that the loans were taken out for me and my education, so I am responsible for repaying them. The ParentPlus Loans cannot be transferred to me, and the payments are literally half of my income each month, because the lowest payment option is based on THEIR income, which is significantly higher than mine.  I have been paying them monthly for a year, and this has forced me to live paycheck to paycheck, unable to save for a car or house. I can\u2019t start a family, and I can\u2019t progress financially in any way due to immediately having to spend every dollar I earn on those payments plus rent/bills/insurance/groceries/therapy/etc\u2026 The ParentPlus Loans are currently in forbearance (since October) until April. This past week I told my parents I will not be resuming payments on them due to 1) Its not my loan. 2) We (Americans) are about to get hit with a recession/depression. 3) I cannot advance in any way making these payments. My mother has responded saying that\u2019s not an option because their retirement and/or credit will be ruined by this choice, and that I will owe them the money. AITA for wanting to stop these payments?  TLDR; My parents took out a loan for me to go to college, but the loan was in their name. They now expect me to pay them back for it, but I can\u2019t afford it. AITA for discontinuing payments so I can afford to live somewhat comfortably?  Edit 1 (More Info): There was no clear communication about repayment discussed when the loans were taken out. My mom took control of financial planning of my college, and I was very passive in the process, unaware any loans were taken out in their name until payments started being due. If they were my personal loans, they would be payed based on my current income. Edit 2 (More Info): My parents didn\u2019t force me to go to a specific school, but also I wasn\u2019t really provided choices. When I graduated high school, the discussion was basically \u201cSo you\u2019re going here, right? Because that\u2019s the best option.\u201d and there wasn\u2019t more debate or discussion on it. I liked the school. My parents liked the school. I didn\u2019t really take ownership of that decision or fight it because my mom took charge of college stuff for me.  Edit 3 (More Info): My parents knew what types of loans were being taken out. They both work in banking/finance, and know how money/loans work. And again, my mom took full accountability/ownership for the financial planning of my college.  Edit 4 (Wording): I have no stopped the payments yet. Adjusted wording to reflect that I want to stop making them. The loans are currently in forbearance. There was no sudden stop of payments to my parents. Edit 5 (Idek): People seem to think I\u2019m set on my opinion. I\u2019m here to listen, learn, and grow. I\u2019m not trying to screw over my parents, and I\u2019m not accusing my parents of being malicious. I\u2019m trying to come up with solutions that my parents and I can use as a team to combat this. And I want to hear all perspectives on the situation. Attacking me by saying I hate my parents or vice versa is simply not true, and not helpful. Edit 6: Because people are still attacking me for being \u201cselfish\u201d or \u201chating my parents\u201d I need to be VERY clear that I am here, again, to listen and learn. You are able to communicate your perspectives respectfully. I don\u2019t hate my parents, nor do they hate me. I\u2019m not set on any plan other than working as a team with my parents to combat this. No one is cutting anyone off unless this escalates wildly and unexpectedly. Yall need to chill on the personal attacks. I can be in the wrong about something without being villainized. If I\u2019m in the wrong, just point it out and explain why. No need to attack me beyond that. Final Edit: Leaning ESH on my own post. Thanks to everyone who has been kind and given me insight, advice, support, and reassurance. My mom and I are working towards coming up with a plan so neither me nor my parents will be screwed over by this. People who kindly and respectfully disagreed with me, you are appreciated. This issue is no longer Me vs My Parents. It\u2019s now Me & My Parents vs The Problem. Thanks all except those menaces who for some reason think I should hate my parents or vice versa. \u2665\ufe0f\ud83d\udd7a\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udd25 ",

However a few days ago she made a comment how we NEVER do meals with her anymore. I calmly asked her what she meant by that and listed all the meals we\u2019ve included her in on then pointed out to her that I actually CAN say that she has never made a single meal for us in years so I don\u2019t understand why she\u2019d say that.

He comes over every weekend so my mom and I can care for the baby on Sunday and Monday nights. They leave for work at 3:00 a.m. and leave the baby with me until my mom gets home at 8:00 a.m. Then my mom takes over until they get back from work at 2:00 p.m. My mom works 12-hour night shifts. I do this once or twice a week, depending on my mom's schedule. Mind you, I did not sign up for this. They pretty much said, She's not doing anything anyway, so she can take care of the baby while my mom gets home. I'm currently not working, hence why I'm home and living off savings. I also have had health issues since November. I will be having surgery soon. This is another issue. I clearly told my mom that I did not want people coming in and out of our house because if I get sick, my surgery will be canceled. She does not care, and my brother and his girlfriend were sick last week, coughing and sneezing all over the house. Now, this weekend, the baby has started to get sick. I just texted them that one of them will have to call off work to take care of the baby because what if she gets worse? I know for a fact that they are still going to leave her and my brother is going to get pissed and start with the name calling.  You're a selfish *****, she's your niece. That's the reason things happen to you because you're a ***** and hypochondriac. You're weak minded.When I wanted to go to the ER for my pelvic pain nobody wanted to take me. I had to call my bf.

We were close, and I'm the godmother to her kids (f9 & f8). For years, I babysat often, sometimes for days or weekends while I was homeless and struggling with mental health. This continued for years. About three years ago, I met my now-wife (f29) and got a job I love. Initially, my sister was happy for me, but soon began complaining I wasn't around as much. I explained that while I loved her and the kids, I had to focus on my happiness. I still saw the kids lots, just not as often. After my wife and I married, things worsened. My sister started accusing me of being abused by my wife because I couldn\u2019t do everything for her anymore. She kept insisting that her kids and her should always come before my wife. She would demand things from us late at night, like chocolate or coffee, even when we were busy. When we didn't drop everything, she\u2019d get upset. Things escalated when she started telling us her husband was abusing her, but then told us not to tell anyone. She also shared inappropriate family gossip, which was triggering for me given my own childhood trauma. Last July, I was hospitalized for a serious illness. During this time, my sister repeatedly accused my wife of being abusive and criticized us for not spending enough time with her kids, even though I was in the hospital. She even said my wife was selfish for not picking up my sister's kids while I was sick. In November, my sister told my wife she wasn't welcome at family events and tried to plan a vacation without her. I tried to talk to her about it, but she mocked my concerns, laughed and dismissed my feelings, saying I was just letting my wife abuse me.I finally lost it, mentioning how unfair it was for my wife to be treated this way, especially when she behaved the way she did, including supporting her supposed abuser. My sister then texted that she wanted nothing to do with me and I was no longer welcome around her kids. This is where I might be the AH, I phoned our eldest sister, distraught. I told her EVERYTHING. Which of course my sister denied.  Afterward, her husband messaged the family group, calling me and my wife vile and accusing us of making up lies about his wife. They then removed us. They also took our holiday money (nearly $1000) and have been bad-mouthing us ever since. So, AITAH for blowing up at her? ",

        "selftext": "Throwaway. My ex-boyfriend and I had been dating for six years and living together for 3. l've been unhappy in our relationship for the past few months and finally decided it was time to break up with him. I broke up with him last week, and it's been extremely painful ever since. There have been a lot of tears and conversations, and trying to navigate moving out on top of everything has been hell. For context, I love my ex very much, but I felt breaking up was my only choice if I wanted to be happy as things were not getting better. On to the story! One of my friends had a bridal shower this weekend, and I could not be more excited for her. My ex-boyfriend and I have been good friends with this person and their fianc\u00e9 \u2014 we have even gone on vacations together. My friend is aware of my break-up and has seen first hand how much I have agonized over this decision. When I arrived at her bridal shower yesterday and started greeting other guests, I quickly realized that somehow everyone in the room already knew about my breakup. Throughout the night, I was approached by multiple people, even ones I barely know, who offered their condolences, told me they were proud of me, asked how my apartment search was going, and prompted me for details about my breakup and impending move. The MOH even pushed for details multiple times in front of the bride\u2019s family, even though I was very clearly trying to navigate away from the subject. The whole night felt like one of those scenes in high school when you walk into a room and notice people looking at you as if they've just been whispering about you. I played it off as best I could and tried to change the subject whenever possible. Apart from that, I would say the evening went fine and everyone had a lovely time celebrating the bride. However, since getting home yesterday, I can't help but feel really betrayed. It feels like my friend used my painful breakup as gossip and shared it with a lot of people who shouldn't know my personal business, especially since I'm not close with them in any way. Both my ex and I are real people with real feelings and our pain shouldn\u2019t be used as party gossip. I've also started receiving texts from people who attended the party, informing me that they've heard what happened and asking how I'm doing. While I understand their intentions are positive, this feels very invasive. These are her friends, not mine. I would have understood her sharing this with her partner or even a close mutual friend of ours, but this was much bigger than that. I texted her today and told her I could no longer be her bridesmaid or friend. Both her and the MOH think I overreacted. Now I\u2019m second guessing my decision and worried I was too rash \u2014 I just simply can\u2019t imagine treating a friend this way when they feel so vulnerable. Am I the asshole?",

We talked about the dates, accommodations and everything we needed for this wedding. I discovered that I could not afford to travel for this wedding I told her that I didn't have the money to travel to Italy and she immediately began screaming at me, telling me You agreed to be a part of this wedding so figure it out I explained to her that when we talked about her wedding before she got engaged it was going to be a small wedding in our hometown, now it has turned into something bigger that I just can't afford.

All my other bridesmaids are coming so why can't you? I felt horrible for it but I told her I had to drop out of being in her wedding as it was expensive to travel, find accommodations, pay for my dress. All of it added up was too much for my budget. She hung up on me and about 10 minutes later her fianc\u00e9 called me and asked me why I was being a horrible friend.

When I discovered the circumstances and amount of the money left, it was obvious my sister (the executor, the POA and caretaker) hid this from us and that it would\u2019ve been a life changing amount of money for each of the beneficiaries on my mother\u2019s will, which states equal splits. We are going to confront her about this and give her the opportunity to fess up and make right to each sibling with the remaining amount and not even be penalized for what she\u2019s spent, so long as she\u2019s compliant and upfront. Honestly I just feel like an asshole wishing there was another way to handle it and fearing she will always resent me for outting this secret. AITA for not giving her a chance to fix it before sharing info with my siblings, even though shes already lied so many times about it and I didn\u2019t feel she\u2019d admit it in this approach? UPDATE: Thanks to everyone who responded. I appreciate the help getting in the right headspace about this. I finally have documented physical evidence now showing there is still quite a lot of $ left- just had to get on a plane and return to my mothers house to fortunately find a paper trail... Will update again. UPDATE: My siblings and I have developed how we want to approach this with her and the oldest is traveling into town as we speak so we are doing this in four hours. We have a lawyer on retainer. If she shows anything but full compliance, we will be forced to continue with legal action which includes removing her as executor and trying to validate the old will which divides the house four ways as well. I stayed up all night photographing documents proving her abuse of power of attorney, fraudulent actions and her self serving interests in hiding assets. She will be returning soon to my moms house (the house left to her in the possibly forged will but which is not in her name yet so she does not have possession of) which is when we will confront her\u2026  My sister has appeared kind and even \u201cgenerous\u201d at times to her friends and to her family. If there wasn\u2019t actual evidence proving these actions, no one that ever met her would believe she could be capable of this. UPDATE: After the initial shock of confrontation, my sister broke down in tears and spat out some swan song final lie about my mothers wishes being that she keep the money and keep it a secret. However she also said she never intended on allowing this money to not be split, but instead wanted to allow it to appreciate for a little longer to increase its total value before surprising us with our inheritance. Honestly, I know she\u2019s lying about that to save face/ maybe she believes that because it makes her feel better. It truly doesn\u2019t matter anymore why or what happened now that she is showing us account information and agreeing to the amounts she will begin transferring to each of us tomorrow after we ALL get to talk to her financial advisor. Legal action scared her and I\u2019m grateful these funds will be recovered. To the rest of it, let sleeping dogs lie. You may say I should still pursue legal recourse but since this money is all I wanted to recover, I don\u2019t care about anything else. I will absolutely keep updating on the progress. If anything goes wrong, legal recourse will be taken.P.S. of course she said she wishes I would\u2019ve come to her first as she obviously would\u2019ve cleared up the misunderstanding. As if.  UPDATE : My sister opened our conversation this morning with trying to get me on a flight home. She\u2019s completely changed her mind now and is pursing legal action. So are we. I\u2019m so angry right now. ",

I (34M) met my wife (36F) 4 years ago. We got ~~engaged~~ married after 1 year together. We have a 2-year-old daughter. We\u2019re both working freelance, and her income is usually two or three times more than mine. We work equally in terms of time spent. When one person is working, the other takes care of the baby. As she earns more, she spends more. She treats herself and the family members (1 child and 2 cats) at her level of income. For example, we dine out a bit too much (I try to cook, not bad, but she usually doesn\u2019t feel like eating at home). She loves to buy expensive fruit over the affordable ones, or buy costly clothing, bags, or a top-of-the-line rice cooker. At the same time, she wants to feel equal in providing for the family. I try my best (I always sleep later and wake up earlier) to meet her expectations (and maybe haven't met them yet?), so I always run out of money every month. Every time I bring this into conversation, it\u2019s always \u201cI have the right to use my money.\u201d There's no way to get her to spend at the same rate as my income (which is above average in my city). -------- She used to work in the fashion industry, so she\u2019s a bit picky about what she wears. I never thought about sitting down with her to write down every item on her wishlist. Because what she can buy, she already buys; and what she can\u2019t buy, I can\u2019t help her with. At least, that\u2019s what I think. So, today, she bought a Chanel lipstick (first time after 3 years) and I (intended to say let me pay) asked for the price, and she replied $50. I said, \u201cWow, a $50 lipstick? Normal people can never use this.\u201d I can\u2019t afford it at the moment, so I didn\u2019t suggest paying for her either. She felt disappointed because of what I said, and because I never buy her any significant things except on birthdays (her last birthday\u2019s gift was a small necklace worth 1/5 of my monthly income) and some special occasions in the 4 years we've been living together. Apart from occasional flowers, I rarely buy her any significant gifts in daily life because I never save enough for this. I mean, it\u2019s not my priority to buy her excessive stuff that she doesn\u2019t really need. So, AITA for not putting my wife's girly stuff more on top of my priority? ----  **EDIT:** As everybody mention about the 50$ lipstick, I must say it's not a big deal for something you will use in 3 years. I just not prepare for that (I thought around 20$ to 30$), so it shock me and I say it out so unthoughtfully. Yep, so her point is not about this lipstick but the fact that I rarely buy her nice stuffs apart from special events. As I can see, my reason as not saving enough for this kind of stuffs is weak and kind of the excuses. On the other hand, we should have more conversation on how the expense is splitted. **EDIT2:** I read all of your comments and feel very thankful. Since this is the first time I tell my story in Reddit and I don't know what to expect. I just try to put on a short version of the situation for not wasting your time. Apparently, it lacks of some information and clarification. I want to answers some FAQ below and give my conclusion. **1. Is she usually have gifts for me? What are those?**  She gifted me many shirts (5 to 7) and pants (~3) in the first year we met, not so after that. She gift me 3 birthday presents - a coat, a helmet, and a phone (a decent 2nd-hand phone I choose to replace my broken one). I don't really remember anything else recently. Now looking back, I can tell how she's obsessed with fashion and want to put nice clothes on me. I feel thankful, for sure, but you see, those things are practically good, but too boring.  My birthdays gift for her is an Instax Camera, a wooden music box with horses cart riding the marrying couple (which turn out to be our's daughter favorite toy...), and a necklace (her choice). I tried to be creative. **2. Do I know that what she want is only a tangible gift to show her my love?** Yes, I know. She told this directly to me. In my defend, I want to shout out that my financial strain caused by following her lifestyle so I could hardly budget anything even for myself (I'm not doing that, I'm writing here to ask for your help instead). I bought her flowers once every two months. I bought snacks and small gifts (funny key chains, etc) occasionally. But those things is too easy to buy so maybe she dismissed it. **3. Do we have joint account? Do we really pay 50/50?** We used to have a joint account (and we put 50/50 into it), somehow it's complicated to handle it so we dismiss it after 2 or 3 months of marriage and spend on our own. Yes, we target for 50/50 on essential things. The renting, the kids (daughter and cats) expense, the market's foods and dine out meal, health care, daily stuffs,.... It's vary depend on every months. But I could say she paying more in general. It could be something between 55/45 to 60/40.  Even I pay less, my money is running out frequently. (For example, she pay 1000$ and I pay 800$). She still have a big deal of money to spend on clothes and sandals and accessories for her and our daughter (more than what their need), expensive fruits and snacks, milk tea,... After that, she still remains some for saving. **4. Does she a materialistic person?** No, I don't think so. I think it's because our love language is un-align.  For example, I touch her and say I love her a lot, but she doesn't enjoy doing that. She usually said it's not the words matter, the actions (gifts?) matter. I spend time with her, listen to her more than enough, and she think that's just obvious couple's obligations. Maybe I should know better about her love language. **5. My conclusion** As many of you pointed out, the question is why I'm still staying here, in the financial strain situation.  I must have a real talk with her (or us with counselor) to set up an equitable expense, not equally expense. Following that, we should have a joint account. I should also budget for some gifts, which is her go-to love language. Thank you very much for supporting me. I can't see how I get through this without your words. I hope I can give you a best UPDATE as I can.",

        "selftext": "Greetings good folks of Reddit, The title pretty much sums up the situation. My father owns a rental property, which we live in, and the remaining 2 units are rented out. Tenant #2, who we will call Mary, drops off her rental check in our mail box. If she is on vacation, or otherwise going away for an extended period of time, she\u2019ll give her rent before she leaves. Sometimes, her brother will bring the rent by to us on her behalf when she is away. It always gets dropped off in our mailbox. Tenant #1, who we will call Juan, does not like to use our mailbox to drop off his rent check. He insists on dropping off his rent in person to whoever is home. If no one is home, or we don\u2019t get back until really late, then he will try again the next day. We\u2019ve told him the mailbox is fine, but he insists on in-person delivery, as he is afraid of check theft/check washing. This would be fine\u2026 except he doesn\u2019t wait for us to open the door. He knocks, rings the doorbell, and when I get to the top of the stairs and look down, he already has the door open and is waiting by the bottom of the stairs. We live on the top floor. The door to our house opens up to a staircase, which leads up to the kitchen to one side and the hallway to the family room on the other side. Unless we lock the door, which we don\u2019t necessarily do during the daytime when we are home, he just opens the door and lets himself in (never going further than the landing at the bottom of the stairs). Today, he came by to drop off the rent. As expected, he rang the doorbell and was waiting at the bottom of the stairs, having let himself in. I asked him -painfully polite as I am terrified of confrontation- \u201cHi Juan! Next time, can you please wait for one of us to open the door?\u201d He looked like I cursed his ancestors, spat in his face, and shit on his carpet. He said \u201cYou don\u2019t want me to open the door?\u201d I said we would prefer if he waited for one of us to open the door for him. He said he opens the door because he doesn\u2019t know if our doorbell works. I assured him, with a smile on my face, that it does work, and that we hear it loud and clear whenever he rings it. He said okay and left, visibly upset. Guys, I cannot emphasize enough how much I hate confrontation, and what a people pleaser I am. I was smiling the entire time, asked him how he and his family were doing, and was pleasant the entire time. He looked at me like I spoke some unimaginable horror. Am I crazy Reddit? Is it wrong of me to have asked Juan to wait by the door to our home until one of us opens it? I feel like not wanting someone to let themselves into your home isn\u2019t a big ask, but he looked so offended, that I am going crazy questioning myself over it. I leave it to you guys to pass judgment. Edit to add a few things: Bumping up edit 4: Additional edit to clarify that **the front door is locked 24/7**. It is the back door that is left unlocked for a small window in the middle of the day, and only when someone is home. 1. The door is locked the majority of the time. There is a *small* window of a few hours in the middle of the day, only when someone is home, that my parents (the actual homeowners) will leave the door unlocked to allow family to come in. 2. I am not the homeowner. I would keep the door locked 24/7 if I was. 3. To the person who said they\u2019d like to see my reaction if something actually important happened in my life, when I said I am \u201cgoing crazy\u201d it was just hyperbole. I am more so confused at the tenant\u2019s strong reaction. 4. Additional edit to clarify that **the front door is locked 24/7**. It is the back door that is left unlocked for a small window in the middle of the day, and only when someone is home. 5. Additional edit to add that my parents don\u2019t care how the tenants pay, whether it is a paper check or an e-transfer. The tenants are older, and prefer to deal with paper checks. 6. I said what I did to Juan **at the request of my parents**.",

        "selftext": "My parents got divorced and my mom moved out. I was still living at the house with my dad and I was covering the utilities which I agreed to help. I had been with my girlfriend(now fianc\u00e9e at the time of their divorce). Well I pretty much moved in with her and was staying at her house during the week and going home on the weekends. It eventually changed to never really going back home unless I needed to speak to my dad about something. He\u2019s been a heavy drinker for most of my life which he still is at this point. Me and my fianc\u00e9e have a baby on the way and we\u2019ve been looking for a place to live and we found one. The only bad thing about the whole situation is that my dad is looking as well and he\u2019s been bugging me about co-signing on a loan with him to get a house but he keeps telling me that he\u2019s going to pay it off with the money from house when it sells. But he\u2019s been saying that we could all move in together and I just don\u2019t think it would be a good idea with the baby and I also don\u2019t feel comfortable doing it and I explained to him because of mine and fianc\u00e9es situation. But anyways, yesterday me and her went to my dads house(that\u2019s currently being sold) to pack some stuff up and he was leaving to go take a walk and he said to me that \u201cI killed him for not co-signing with him\u201d. I\u2019m feeling really guilty about it and it\u2019s been tugging at my heart. I just want to know\u2026 Am I the asshole and in the wrong for not helping him? Or should I have helped and jeopardized me and my fianc\u00e9e\u2019s future?  -EDIT-Okay so I apologize to everyone that has replied about not providing enough information I was typing this out on my phone and didn\u2019t want a massive paragraph for everyone to read. So I\u2019m going to answer some of the questions that I was seeing in the comments. Me(M26) and my fianc\u00e9e (F27) have been together since 2018 and have a baby on the way that will be born in May. We are going through the buying process of a home currently. My father and mother are getting half of the money that the house is being sold for after the remaining balance of the house is paid but the only reason he wants me to co-sign on the loan is because his credit isn\u2019t the best. He got a DUI a couple years ago so he doesn\u2019t car so he basically relies on me to take him places which I don\u2019t mind taking if I have time and it\u2019s places like the grocery store, appointments, etc. but I feel like he\u2019s been getting pretty comfortable with it cause he doesn\u2019t ask me anymore just basically demands that I do it now.

        "selftext": "I don\u2019t really know what to do but I\u2019m really anxious and upset about this. a few months ago, my kitten poked some holes in my roommates gaming chair. it\u2019s a 300 dollar chair. she told me about it and i took some pictures of the damage. the holes aren\u2019t deep but there are little bits of leather peeling. i told her i could get something to fix it, but eventually i told her that i would pay for it to get fixed bc i didn\u2019t trust my skills.  today she sent me a long paragraph about how my kitten has been chewing her decorative flowers, chewing her cables and headphones to the point where they don\u2019t work, and that her chair is still ruined and she wants reimbursement for it.  i showed my parents and they agreed to 100% pay for a new chair if she gave us the ruined chair. this chair really isn\u2019t \u201cruined,\u201d it just has a few little holes that i could probably crudely fix with glue. we assumed she was going to scrap the chair because of how she presented it (\u201che (my cat) fucked it up\u201d) but I didn\u2019t want it to go to waste. i also could sell the chair for some of the money back. she said she wants to keep the ruined chair. when my mom saw that she said this, she flipped out. i understand why. my mom said that\u2019s basically giving her a gift, not a reimbursement. my roommate said she wanted to keep the chair so that she can have one chair in her room at the apartment, and one in her room at her parents house so she doesn\u2019t have to bring it back and forth.  the way she worded this ircked me a lot. my parents 100% agreed that if she doesn\u2019t give us her ruined chair, we are not paying anything for a new one for her. she\u2019s really mad at this. when i got home she was crying about how her stuff is ruined, and how my cat got into her cables and broke her headphones. i told her she should keep her door closed from now on like our other roommates do, that way there\u2019s no chance he\u2019ll (my cat) get in and he\u2019ll get used to not being in the room, like he did with our other roommates. she kept the door open, and low and behold he walked right into her room. she then cried more about him being in there.  i\u2019m going to keep my cat in my room from now on, only letting him out when i\u2019m home to supervise. he has plenty of toys, wall shelves to climb, and things to do in my room. everything is in here, so it\u2019ll just be a bit of an adjustment for him. she\u2019s been texting me for the entire rest of the night talking about how her stuff is ruined and shes saying things like \u201cwhat do i do?\u201d and \u201ci don\u2019t know what to do\u201d. i\u2019m starting to think she\u2019s trying to guilt me into giving her the money. am i overreacting to this? should i give her the money? i dont know what to do.  EDIT: I should probably add that my roommate will actively seek out my cat while he\u2019s in my room to bring into her room, that\u2019s where the problem lies. I try to keep him separated from precious materials, but I\u2019m not always there to supervise.  my cat is NOT destructive as most people are saying. he has never ripped apart anything. her chair is the thing she\u2019s upset about, but the only other thing my cat has gotten into is her headphone cable. but my cat doesn\u2019t go around chewing and scratching things. he didn\u2019t scratch her chair, either. it was holes poked from him walking on it and putting out his claws a bit. neither me nor my other roommates have ever had a problem.  EDIT/UPDATE: 2/6/25 Thanks guys for the comments. I took lots of your advice and me and my roommate were able to \u201ctalk it out\u201d (she came to me and apologized profusely). I think my roommates mom is still upset though, because her mom called MY mom and bitched about it apparently. I wasn\u2019t there, but that\u2019s what my mom said happened. Anyways thanks a bunch for helping me not spiral into a panic attack! ",

        "selftext": "I really didn\u2019t mean to cause any harm with this, but I\u2019m 24 hours everything has blown up. I (17f) had the first day of school yesterday. It\u2019s my final year of high school, and I\u2019m pretty involved with school clubs, so I know a lot of people even though I\u2019m not popular and not involved with much drama, until no. On the way home I saw some friends I hadn\u2019t talked to over the holidays and while chatting one of them brought up a girl we can call Layla (16f). Two of my friends had heard that Layla was telling people her sister Cassidy (18f) who graduated last year is now pregnant. I knew Cassidy and even though we weren\u2018t close friends, she was always super nice. None of us really believed it, but they had both heard it separately, and thought it was weird. I thought since Cassidy wasn\u2019t at school to defend herself or even hear about it, someone should tell her that people in Y11 and Y12 were hearing it. So I dm\u2019d her on instagram telling her what I\u2019d heard, said I didn\u2019t believe it, and didn\u2019t really expect a response. She messaged me back thanking me and asking a few question, and I thought I\u2019d done the right thing. Apparently not, because today Layla found me at lunch and yelled at me for messaging her sister. Turns out their mum saw the message and now they have family drama, and are blaming Cassidy for the rumour being spread, not Layla. Layla said she had no idea the rumour was spreading at all, and she had no part in it. Layla also said I had no right inserting myself in family drama, and if the I heard one of Cassidy\u2019s friends spread the rumour it would have been fine, but since I thought it was her, I should have gone to Layla first, not Cassidy. She was yelling so loud and for so long teachers got involved and tried to set up meetings for us and potentially our parents as well, but I said it wasn\u2019t necessary. I apologised to Layla for causing family drama, but said I didn\u2019t feel bad for telling Cassidy what was being said about her, because I thought she deserved to find out as soon as possible. Layla said I wasn\u2019t Cassidy\u2019s friend, and not to see her, talk to her, or message her again. Even so, I messaged Cassidy an apology for starting family drama, which I am genuinely sorry for. She hasn\u2019t responded, and I don\u2019t expect her to. But even so, I don\u2019t think I was the asshole for telling Cassidy there was a pregnancy rumour about her.   EDIT for clarity: Cassidy is not pregnant and Layla said she didn\u2019t start it or tell anyone",

        "selftext": "Hello! Longtime lurker, first time poster here. I (25F) went to a friend\u2019s wedding a few months ago. The friends are Matt (25M), and Susan (25F). We\u2019re all part of a much larger friend group that gets along pretty great. To preface, I have actually never attended a wedding before in my life, and I don\u2019t tend to dress up or put on makeup. Nothing against it, it\u2019s just expensive and time consuming and I work 16-hour days in a uniform. I was really excited when I got the invite, saved up, and went to a shop I know carries my size (I\u2019m fairly tall). The clerk was amazing and so helpful. He chose a selection of dresses that would be wedding appropriate that weren\u2019t close to what the bridal party would be wearing and we had a lot of fun trying things on and he hyping me up. One of the options I just fell in love with. It was a beautiful dark green silk \u201cbias-cut\u201d dress (think Kiera Knightley in Atonement, without the sash and less of a flowing skirt). We matched it with heels and I\u2019d never felt prettier. The dress was on sale too, so that was a plus! Wedding day comes and it\u2019s lovely. I\u2019m so happy for my friends. Susan ignores me, which is weird, but she\u2019s busy preparing and then the wedding is in full swing and the reception is busy so I don\u2019t think much of it. Everything goes off without a hitch and they drive off to their honeymoon. I suppose it\u2019s relevant, but I received several compliments on my outfit during the event. I didn\u2019t think it caused a scene, and it wasn\u2019t anything particularly effusive or over the top. I was doing the same to others so I didn\u2019t think it stood out.Everything concludes, we all have a nice time. No one says anything until tonight. We all got together for a \u201cWelcome Back!\u201d dinner for Matt and Susan. During the dinner Susan kept making snipes at me about what I wore, just incredibly passive aggressive. It was very clear she thought I overdressed. I didn\u2019t say anything at the time because I felt terrible. None of my friends corrected or stopped her either. But looking back on it I feel\u2026 wronged? She didn\u2019t give me the benefit of the doubt and I don\u2019t feel like my dress was over-the-top. I do think I likely look very different from how I normally dress and present myself, so that might be part of it?  I\u2019m trying not to go over the word limit but am very open to questions and elaborations if needed.  So Reddit, AITA?  TLDR: wore a nice dress to a wedding, the bride is angry ever since. AITA?  Alright, my update was way too long and I honestly don\u2019t know if I can shorten it and it still give all the details - so I\u2019m going to be posting it on my own profile. ",

My brother and his wife, on the other hand, expect the best accommodations and meals without contributing financially. They also tend to make plans with other friends and ditch us during vacations. My brother and his wife earn about the same as my husband and me, and our parents are retired school teachers living on a fixed income. Due to financial limitations, our family reunions have become less frequent. My husband and I still go on vacation with our kids every year, sometimes joined by my sister and mom. My dad has physical limitations and only travels when he is well enough. My kids have been requesting a trip to my homeland, where we have many distant relatives. We decided to keep our plans quiet to avoid being hijacked by the family. We booked an Airbnb and only told my sister, who decided to join us. This created an issue with my parents, as they expected her to visit them. My mom eventually bought plane tickets for herself and dad using air miles, without telling dad. So, it's now the eight of us going, and we decided not to invite anyone else due to financial constraints. I recently learned that my brother and his wife were also planning the same trip but with her friends. When they saw the cost, my brother called dad, hoping he would pay for it. However, my parents have faced financial hardships recently. Dad did not fund my brother's trip, and mom secretly told my brother about our plans, asking him to reach out to me. He never called and canceled his plans. My sister accidentally told one of our nieces about the trip, who then informed her parents. My sister-in-law was furious, she told me she would have invited us if they were planning a trip.  I told her I knew of her travel plans and we were not included. I then suggested we all go on a family cruise and would be happy to plan it.  I reached out twice with the suggestion, but she has not responded. ",

        "selftext": "I 44F have been divorced from my ex husband 41M for the last 13 years. We have 2 kids, 15M, and 13F, together. He is remarried to 33F and has 2 additional boys with her. They are 11 and 10.  They have been legally separated for the last 2 years and live in differnt states. She has continued to be in our kids lives and we all have agreed to keep the sibling bond strong amoung all 4 kids.  Last year she started taking the kids on seperate trips but 2 at a time to celebrate thier birthdays. One of her boys and my daughter went to Las Vegas (out of state for all of us) with her for their birthdays. And she took my son and her other son on a white water rafting trip for thier birthdays. Again out of state for her and her son.  A couple of days ago out of the blue my daughter was on FaceTime with step mom and my daughter asked to go on a overseas trip with just her step mom for 4 days over spring break. I asked if we could make a girls trip, so I could also go, and my daughter said no. I suggested something in county just the 2 of them and step mom is refusing that idea. My ex asked if he could go and my daughter said no. She just wants to spend time with step mom alone.  She claims to be a last minute planner and does not currently have a booked or planned out itinerary. And when I told step mom I wasn\u2019t comfortable with my daughter going alone with her she lost her mind. She is claiming I am robbing her of this amazing expirence out of jealously. I feel as if she is buying her affection and overstepping every parenting boundary there is under the sun. And completely disregarding my parenting decisions and disrespecting me as mom.  Ex supports daughter traveling with her alone and has basically washed his hands of the argument. She is ready to bring this to a court to force my hand. I hate this. I am not ok with my 13 year old dictating travel plans with out my input or censent.  Everything in me says this is not a good idea. I don\u2019t trust step mom, and I don\u2019t trust air travel right now  and with the state of the world I don\u2019t think traveling with out bio parent is a good idea.  So AITA?  ",

        "selftext": "Sorry if this is long or confusing, I\u2019ve never used Reddit before. I (26F) have been having an issue with my cousin \u201cEmma\u201d (29F) that has gotten the whole family involved, and I need some outside perspective. Our grandfather hadn\u2019t been in great health the past few years, and over the past month or two he\u2019d really gone downhill. He was admitted to the hospital a couple of weeks ago in full-on kidney failure. We\u2019d known this was coming- about a year ago a doctor had told us his kidney function was really poor and since he decided not to do dialysis, he had maybe a year left to live (turns out that doctor was exactly right). I\u2019d been to visit him in the hospital a few evenings after work, and it was rough; he wasn\u2019t too coherent and I knew there wasn\u2019t much they could do. It was sad but not really unexpected; he was 85 and like I said, health had been bad for a while.  Anyway, Emma\u2019s job doesn\u2019t have a typical 9-5 schedule, so it\u2019s easier for her to visit him at the hospital in the mornings. A few days ago I was at work when, at about 10 am, I checked Facebook on my phone. The first thing I saw was a long post from Emma announcing that our grandfather had died. Needless to say, that was NOT the way I wanted to find out. I commented telling Emma that it was wrong to post this without first making sure the whole family knew, and she should take the post down.  Just a few minutes later my father texted asking me to call him, and when I did he told me what I already knew. Turns out Emma had made her Facebook post less than an hour after he died, when there were still a lot of family members that didn\u2019t know. I wasn\u2019t the only one who found out via that post, and none of us were too happy about it. A couple of days later my uncle (Emma\u2019s dad) told me he\u2019d specifically told Emma to wait until she knew family had been notified before posting anything (we all know how obsessed with social media she is). He was livid when he learned she\u2019d posted about it so quickly despite him telling her not to. At the memorial service Emma confronted me, saying I\u2019d \u201cembarrassed\u201d her by making my comment on her Facebook post. Apparently some of her friends had seen my comment and agreed that it had been wrong of her to post the news so quickly. A lot of people are mad at her for it, and she\u2019s claiming that I \u201cturned friends and family against her\u201d by calling her out in my comment. This has just added a bunch of extra stress to an already tough situation, and I really want an outside opinion on if making the comment was wrong. ",

        "selftext": "First off all the disclaimers: Sorry for formatting I am on my phone and also English us not my first language so I apologize for any errors. I (34f) broke up with my Ex Boyfriend (40m) last June, so a little over 7 months ago. There wasnt any big blowout reason, the relationship just didn't work out for me. I put in all the effort while he always provided the bare minimum and at some point I just didn't feel like taking care of a grown ass man anymore. It was really hard on him and he kept texting me for a while. I replied politely but also told him he needs to move on. It was just too little too late. I know I may sound coldhearted but I had my reasons to break up with him and I didn't really want to stay in constant contact or keep being friends. So yesterday I was out with my siblings and he randomly calls me. I have a tendency to people pleasing so my sister took my phone, rejected the call and texted him that I was unavailable due to being out with them.He texted back asking me to call him when I was available because something bad happened.  So I finally grew a spine and told him I couldn't provide him emotional support and to please understand. He then texted me that his mother had passed away and he just needed someone to talk to and how could I be so cold towards him.This is where I might be the asshole because I still did not want to call him and be his emotional support. I just want to stay out of this and as sad as I am for him I don't want to be involved in this. So am I the Asshole?",

        "selftext": "I (21M) moved out at 18 for work and college. My family always praised how independent and happy I became. Two years ago, I started dating a high school friend (we\u2019re both men), and a year later, he moved in. I hid our relationship because my family is from a small conservative town and has outdated views\u2014my dad thinks LGBT+ people \u201cjust do it for attention.\u201d Last weekend, I finally told them. I started by explaining I\u2019m *aroace*, which is why I never introduced anyone before. They said they didn\u2019t want me to be alone and should give more people a chance. Then I revealed I\u2019ve had a boyfriend for two years. The irony? The type of relationship they always described as perfect for me is exactly the one I have. Their reaction was awful. My dad prayed at the table and went silent. My mom cried in her room, saying I ruined her dream of grandkids (even though I told them years ago I don\u2019t want kids). When I got home, she texted: *Your dad is really upset and won\u2019t accept this. Please give us time. You\u2019re always welcome at home, but [my boyfriend] coming wouldn\u2019t be good. I love you, even if it\u2019s not what I expected, and I just ask you to respect us too.* I just replied *Ok, I understand.* But I don\u2019t know if I do. I feel like my happiness is something they need to digest. Now, I\u2019m considering not visiting them or allowing them in my home until they accept my boyfriend. It seems fair\u2014if my relationship isn\u2019t accepted in their house, then they shouldn\u2019t be welcome in mine until they respect it. But part of me feels guilty, like I might be \u201casking too much\u201d from people with such a closed mindset. The immediate issue: tomorrow, they\u2019re delivering a fridge (a gift from last year) while my boyfriend and I are at work. I\u2019ve tried hiring delivery before, but it\u2019s hard to carry a fridge up three flights of stairs. I suspect they\u2019ll wait for us to get home, and I *don\u2019t* want to see them. After everything, I don\u2019t want to pretend things are normal. AITA for refusing to see them and cutting contact until they accept my boyfriend? EDIT RESPONSE TO COMMENTS: I\u2019ve seen a lot of responses in a short time\u2014thank you to everyone who took the time to reply. I wanted to add some missing details and context that I left out in the original post. * **English is not my first language**, so I didn\u2019t realize that cutting off sounds extreme. That\u2019s not what I meant\u2014I don\u2019t plan to completely cut them out of my life, just to stop visiting them or having them over until they accept my boyfriend (we live two hours apart).* As I mentioned, my boyfriend was my **high school friend**, and my dad never liked him, even before we were dating. He used to call him the Brazilian equivalent of *faggot* behind his back and got angry whenever I mentioned his name. I lost a lot of friendships because of my family's homophobia, but this was the first one I refused to let go of just because my dad disapproved.* The reason I decided to tell them **after two years** is that they kept giving me positive feedback about my emotional well-being and quality of life. So I thought, *if they\u2019ve been so happy with my changes since I\u2019ve been with him, why would they see him as a bad influence?** One of the worst things my mom said to me privately was: *I never thought about having another child, but after what you told me, I reconsidered.* That really hurt me.* I **do believe they can change** (especially my mom), but I know it will be difficult. They\u2019ve always struggled to understand even basic things about me, like the fact that I\u2019m **introverted and autistic** with sensory sensitivities. Ever since I was a kid, they would drag me to loud parties, and when I got overwhelmed or didn\u2019t enjoy them, they blamed me for not trying to have fun. Even after I got my **autism diagnosis** as an adult, my dad still refuses to acknowledge it.* Since I moved out, I **pay for my own college, rent, and transportation** without any family support (aside from occasional gifts that I never ask for).* About the **fridge**, it was a **Christmas gift** they bought for me, but the Brazilian postal service kept saying they would deliver it and never did. I even took time off work to be home, only for them to never show up. Eventually, my mom got a refund and bought another one closer to her house (two hours away). They had already planned to deliver it before I even brought up this issue. I feel like **I should take it so they can\u2019t use it as leverage against me.*** They have **a spare key to my place**, which was never an issue before (my mistake in hindsight). I\u2019m now considering staying home tomorrow to receive the fridge myself and **take my key back.** Again, thanks for all the insights and perspectives\u2014I really appreciate it.",

        "selftext": "So 5 years ago me, my brother, and 2 other good friends we\u2019ve known for 20+ years planned a big trip to ski in Europe.  A year ago we started talking about doing it again for my 40th birthday but skiing in Japan this time.  We also decided to open up the invite to a specific few others that we all knew well from college and who wished they were invited on the last trip.  Two more committed so now our group was 6 people.  A couple weeks ago one friend Payton (name changed for privacy purposes) asked my brother Johny who was planning the entire trip if he could invite his half brother.  Johny told him politely no because nobody else knew him and adding a 7th would mess with logistics (guides, dinner reservations and hotel reservations) and the vibe would be different having someone there nobody knows.  Payton wasn\u2019t happy and said \u201cbut I thought we were opening up the trip to others\u201d to which Johny reminded him that was only to specific people we\u2019ve all known since college.  Well a week later Johny told people nobody can back out at this point because our most expensive hotel reservation was becoming non-refundable to which everyone confirmed they were not backing out.  4 days after this and a month before the trip, Payton tells my brother Johny and myself his half brother is coming and he\u2019s not going to be rude and uninvite him and we are being jerks for saying he can\u2019t come.  He apologizes for misunderstanding that we only opened up the invite to certain people but refuses to un-invite his half brother.  We tell him if he\u2019s truly sorry, he\u2019ll tell his brother it was a miscommunication and he\u2019ll do another trip with him.  He refuses and says he and his brother are coming on the trip and following the exact same itinerary whether we like it or not.  All 5 other members of the group call him and tell him what he\u2019s doing is very socially awkward and selfish to bring this all up after flights and hotels were non-refundable.  He still refuses to change course.  So we changed our logistics now to expel him from the ski group with guides and we aren\u2019t letting him stay in the rooms we booked and we plan to not hang out with him on the trip but he and his half brother will be on all the same flights and likely staying at same hotels which will be awkward.  Who is in the wrong here and how should this situation be handled? ",

She has no understanding of boundaries, overshares, can be very rude... The type that picks a vegan restaurant then complains to the waitress that they don't have bacon & eggs. Kyle wants to have a good relationship with her but it's hard. I'm polite with Mary but spending time with her is difficult. I actually suggested the trip because she regularly complains that Kyle spends more time with his father than with her, and I know it makes him feel bad. One evening towards the end of the trip, we were all sitting together watching TV and the conversation drifted to Kyle's father, John. John is a generally good guy, and both Kyle and I have a good relationship with him. Mary & him were never together as a couple. Mary started saying mean things about Kyle's father, then suddenly went off about him, telling us how he's a terrible person and now he's got a cushy little life because of all the money from the settlement. Kyle's father is a victim of malpractice, he went in for a routine operation and ended up heavily handicapped. He almost died & had to stop working. He sued and got money from the hospital. I got angry and told her to stop this type of talk and that considering he almost died and was handicapped for life, it was hardly cushy. She told me she could say whatever she liked and that he'd made her life hard back in the days so she could be mean now. I answered I didn't have to stay and listen to this type of shit and left for bed. Afterwards Kyle told me he hadn't said anything because he was so used to it but he was happy I'd told her to stop. The next day she didn't talk about the argument. Three weeks after we left, Kyle called her to get some news. She told him that we had hurt her when we were are her place, and that she found my attitude disrespectful and mean. I feel kind of insane right now so: am I the asshole?",

        "selftext": "Just started working for my dad last month after he told me his business was doing well and it's a sector I have experience in. He said it would be alot of hours/hard work and I was happy to still start. First month worked 50+ hours per week and he paid in full (\u00a312.50/hour). At the start of this month he said he'd make me a director of the company as it meant paying me was more tax effective and that was fine with me. Fast forward to today and I get my payslip and it's only for \u00a31900 for the month (at 12.50 per hour is should have been 2500+). So I sent him a text to let him know he had underpaid me and got a snarky text back about being on a \u00a32000/month salary now. This equates to under minimum wage as I worked 200 hours this month. When I said this to him he said he was so disappointed and made out I was being ungrateful for the opportunity to be a part of the business and that he worked 70+ hours per week setting the business up. I asked him if I could switch back to per hour wages instead of a fixed salary and he told me to find a new job. I don't think he's serious about this (I think maybe he's just having a bad day or something) but I'm unsure what to do and his strong reaction makes me think maybe I am in the wrong? Would love some advice. TL:DR - Switched from per hour to fixed salary and now earning under minimum wage, asked to switch back and told that I am being ungrateful",

We\u2019ve been working on a major research project, and while we were supposed to have made a lot more progress by now, my group has been doing the most basic parts of the work. My group has been kind of a mess, with me being the youngest (just turned 17 in september), and the oldest being 21 (M). Everything was going fine until recently. I had been working hard, staying up late to meet the deadline, making sure all the research and papers were in order. I even reached out to validators to ensure everything was accurate. It seemed like we were on track. But then, my groupmate\u2019s grandmother\u2014who isn\u2019t even involved in the project\u2014decided to talk to the teacher. She claimed that I was making her granddaughter's life harder, saying that she doesn't get enough sleep and that it was my fault. She even went as far as saying that I \u201cordered\u201d her granddaughter to do all the work. Honestly, I was in shock. Last time I checked, the groupmate (18 F) barely showed up to meetings and was often out with her friends at the arcade. Meanwhile, I had bags under my eyes from staying up late working on everything. When my teacher asked about the situation, they were confused because I was always the one doing the work. The teacher even asked if my groupmate had contributed at all, and all I could say was \u201cI guess\u201d because I honestly didn\u2019t know how else to respond. I just stayed silent the rest of the day. After that incident, I stopped working with the group altogether and started helping other groups instead. I don\u2019t feel like putting in any more effort when they don\u2019t even acknowledge what I\u2019ve done.

When the bins are full, most of the time they don\u2019t get emptied till I ask. In summer when the bins have been sitting too long, they don\u2019t get emptied till I ask. I have reminders set in our shared calendar that will notify us the night before to put the bins out, and I still have to remind him on some weeks.  This morning I reminded my husband that the recycling bin is full (my second reminder as I\u2019ve mentioned it the night before). Our bins are a bit funny where you can\u2019t lift the whole thing out and tip it outside so you have to take each recyclable out. My husband usually grabs as much as he can carry and asks me to pass the rest through a side window. Today, I suggested that he can easily grab a basket, box, shopping bag (all of which are within an arms reach), fill it up and take it all in one trip. I did just that to demonstrate but he got very frustrated and kicked the box that I filled away. I\u2019m not sure if the kick was an accident as it was in the way but his body language reads angry.

When a household task gets assigned to me (and I\u2019d say 70% of all tasks are) I get everything done on my own but when it gets assigned to my husband, somehow it\u2019s on me to make sure he remembers to do it \u2014 and in this instance, a simple task turns into a two person job.  AITA for not helping him?  ",

        "selftext": "For reference, I am 5'4 (21f) and 200lbs. I used to be 220, but I am making improvements to my lifestyle and working on my health so I have lost some weight (and plan to loose more since I am still technically obese.) I was talking with my friends about various topics, as one does, and somehow the topic of body size came up. I opened up to my friends about how I was insecure about the size of my body, and that it made basic tasks like shopping for clothes and doing exercise more challenging, and I told them that I was trying to improve upon myself. However, my friends said that talking about my body size was making them uncomfortable and that we should move on to a different topic, and that it was inconsiderate to talk about private details during casual conversations. I thought that that claim was ridiculous because the size of my body is not exactly... a secret. Still, I stopped talking about it, but I don't thinking that me talking about my body was an inconsiderate thing to do because we were on that topic, and my friends (who are slimmer than me) had also complained about their bodies, so I thought we were bonding over sharing our struggles and insecurities. (As friends do). I know people have their boundaries, but was I really being inconsiderate by opening up about the struggles that I face in my body size?  Edit: Some people were wondering about the context. It was a get-together with me and 3 other friends at one of the friend's house. We have known each other for 4 years (we met in college) and I would say we are pretty close. My friends started the conversation about bodies and insecurities and were talking about how they felt insecure about things like hip dips, cellulite, etc. and how they felt like they couldn't always find clothes that fit them well, so I thought my input was appropriate at the time.",

        "selftext": "This backstory is important for it to make sense later - My dad already died 11 years ago and he was adopted when he was a baby, someone left him on his adoptive parent's door. His parents named him and used their surname for my dad. In my country, it is illegal to add your surname to the adopted kid. But it was back in 50s, nobody cares that much.  My dad is the only adopted kid and the eldest of 5. Although he was adopted, he really loved the family and worked really hard to support them. He also had to leave his dreams behind just to support his small siblings. The siblings knew how hard my dad worked his ass off.  Grandparent already died as well 20+ years ago and left some inheritance. My dad was part of the inheritance due to having the same surname. My dad was promised by their siblings that he would get his portions. The inheritance took years to process due to missing documents etc.  All was good, untillll, my dad died. His siblings decided to remove his name from the inheritance saying he was adopted and not qualified to get the portions. His siblings kept pestering us to tell the lawyers the truth and back out from the inheritance. To be honest, we didn't care about the inheritance, but the way they treat us after my dad died, it hurts us. We felt being betrayed and who knew, just because of inheritance, they throw us like some trash. If my dad was here, surely he would be depressed seeing how his siblings treated us. He really loved them.  And since that moment, I vowed myself and let my family know that I will not join any family events and do not want to see them anymore. My siblings agreed, and my mom too agreed, but since she is the oldest sister-in law, she had to join the family events just to respect my dad. My mom told me that if my dad was here, he would want his family to be here to celebrate my wedding, and out of respect to my beloved dad, I should invite them. But I stand firm on my decision, they didn't respect my dad after he died, so why should I? I know, not inviting them will get them on nerves and will keep pestering my mom if I didn't invite them. And people will talk and it will look bad on my mom and my late dad. I really don't want my parent to get the bad reputation just because of I hate them. Buuutttt, I really don't want to invite them, I know I will have bad mood through out the wedding if I see their faces. And no, I am not close with the cousins. So I really don't mind. WIBTA?  ",

        "selftext": "Hey Reddit  I (24f) bought some pants a couple of months back from an online thrifting website. The pants are unique and I payed a reasonable amount for them. I asked for the measurements and they should fit my size. I was super excited to receive them. I\u2019ve struggled my whole life finding pants that fit my body type and this time yet again they didn\u2019t fit around my hips.  My friend (25f) is smaller than me. I\u2019ve given her pants and other clothes before I couldn\u2019t fit. Not that long ago I gave her some unique pants again found thrifting online and they fit her perfectly. She got to buy them for a cheap price. She loved them and wore them often and it honestly hurt to see the pants I was so excited to fit me actually fit her.  So this time around I got some pants that of course yet again are too small. Instead of showing them to my friend first, because she\u2019s a smaller fit, I decided to put them on sale online instead.  I showed her my profile on the online thrifting website and she saw the pants and she now insists on trying them on.  I\u2019m well aware that I\u2019m playing into my insecurities and my jealousy when telling her that I\u2019d rather sell them online for a stranger to wear them instead of her, because it hurts too much to see her wear the pants I got excited would fit me. I have explained this to her and she\u2019s thinks I\u2019m being very unreasonable.  So, am I the asshole for not letting my friend try the pants I recently bought - instead I want to sell them online? Am I playing too much into my insecurities - should I let her try the pants and let her buy them if they fit?  Edit: Update!First of all, selling clothes online came up as a conversation topic and I brought up that I just started selling online. She then wanted to see my profile and spotted the pants. I did not smear the pants in her face just for me to tell her she can\u2019t have them. In hindsight, maybe I should\u2019ve just not told her I started selling online but I swear to god it wasn\u2019t some kind of evil plan to make her envious of my pants and jerk her around. Second of all, I am not jealous that she is smaller than me. I\u2019m jealous she can fit the pants I put my time and effort into finding. Good thrift finds are hard to come by. Third of all, she was not mad at me for not letting her try them on. She just didn\u2019t understand my reasoning. To all of you saying I need serious help; I am actively seeking help for my insecurities and have been through therapy before. After almost 15 years of friendship, me and my friend are very close - almost a sister status. We read all your replies and it opened up a healthy and interesting conversation between the both of us which only made our friendship stronger.  Thanks to all of you. You helped me realise that it\u2019s okay for me to have insecurities and that my feelings are valid, but I see now and I agree with a lot of you that it\u2019s border-lining pettiness and I will try my best work against that sooooo: I let her try the pants on (!!) and oh well she didn\u2019t even fit them lol, but a good conversation came out of it and from now on I won\u2019t hide them from my friend but I will definitely demand the same price I\u2019m selling them for online.",

I didn\u2019t sleep well. I was terrified of them crawling on me in my sleep.  The fact that she doesn\u2019t see them as a problem is also concerning to me. She\u2019s just accepted them and isn\u2019t doing anything to combat them, which tells me the problem will just get worse.

I\u2019ve helped him before, but honestly, it just doesn\u2019t seem to be helping him long term. He keeps making the same mistakes. I told him no this time. I suggested he start budgeting better, or maybe even talk to a financial advisor, but he didn\u2019t take it well. He\u2019s upset and now he\u2019s telling the rest of the family that I\u2019m being selfish.

        "selftext": "I have (had) a friend from my childhood days. I'm M40, my wife is F40, my friend Julie was F38. Our son turns 9 tomorrow. I haven't spoken to Julie for the last about 7-8 years, but when we were in school, we were in the same clique, even though when we met, she was 13 and I was 15. She was really cool, and I will admit, we, the boys, all had a crush on her. It didn't go anywhere between us, and after a time, I left for another city, started dating my wife, and we were together already for several years, when Julie reached out to me via socials. We discussed her current relationship, how it was toxic and abusive, and she had to end it. When I discussed our conversations with my wife, I saw that she was kind of jealous. I stopped our conversations because I love my wife and didn't want her to worry. Then I found out Julie met another guy I knew from another friends group. They hit it off, got married, moved to our city. I met her once for drinks. I saw that Julie was truly happy in the new relationship, and that's what really mattered to me.  Two days ago, her husband reached out to me (again, we haven't been in touch for 7-8 years). He said that unfortunately Julie has passed away. He was very depressed and asked if I am able to be there for the service. He felt like he needed all support he could get (he has no relatives in the city we live in and only several friends). He said she spoke well of me, and he wanted there to be more people who knew her, at the service and afterwards. The service was today, on Saturday, but tomorrow is our son's birthday. I did ask my wife if she's OK with me going. She's very into the vibes, she has a lot of bad memories about the cemeteries, dead people, things like that. However, she said that if I want to, I should be the one to decide. We still had time for final preparations for the birthday, and today in the morning she even helped me pick the flowers for Julie. So, I went to the service, and reception afterwards, total of around 3 hours spent, then we went to the store together, spent some time with our son playing football, and went to the restaurant to pick up the cake. That's when the conversation kinda went sideways. Turns out she is very frustrated that I spent time in that place instead of happy busy preparations for the birthday, I am in a downed mood now, and she can't stop thinking about it, and she doesn't want to get any flowers tomorrow (I'm usually getting the flowers), and she will now never even go into that flower shop around the corner, because it's forever associated with picking up funeral flowers. I'm kinda at a loss. Yes, I knew that she has this anticemetery outlook, was I supposed to turn down the person explicitly asking me to come? Even if we haven't been in touch for several years, I didn't feel like it would be OK to turn down such an ask. And I really wanted to say goodbye.  Now, it does seem like I prioritised someone else over my own family. Even if a little bit. AITA?",

        "selftext": "My gf (21f) and I (23M) live together and lately I've been getting a little frustrated with how we handle household chores. I do pretty much everything... all the time. I cook, clean, do dishes, get groceries, you name it. I don't mind doing more, because I genuinely enjoy doing something nice for a partner, but it hurts me that she doesn't reciprocate back. I could make dinner 7 nights in a row, and she'll say no if I ask her to cook us some pasta the next night. Anyways, we had a discussion regarding chores and I expressed my issues. I said I don't mind doing more, but I need something from her. We decided that she would handle sweeping and cleaning the litter boxes. Seems simple enough, but two weeks go by and she doesn't do either, ever. This upset me, so one night when I was heading out and she was staying home, I asked her if she could clean the house. I had a lot going on that day, and didn't get to the chores I normally would. She hesitantly said yes, and did, but the next day she expressed how she didn't feel it was right for me to put it all on her. She says that since I work remote, I have more time to do chores, therefore it should be my responsibility. I was speechless. I normally do nearly everything, every single day Her commute is about 15 minutes, and she works on computers all day, just like me. I get it, I have the privilege of being able to wash some dishes in between work activities, which is why I don't mind doing more, but AITA for not wanting to do everything? It's not like I have ample time before she gets home, many nights I'm still doing chores while she comes home and smokes weed. She even got mad because while I was doing the dishes to cook us dinner, I asked her to get the sponges from her car once she walked in from work. She said I could have texted before she walked in. Sure, but like, I'm about to spend nearly an hour doing stuff for us but you can't take 1 minute to get a sponge? Sorry im ranting a bit, but am I crazy?? **tl;dr**  **My gf said that I should do all the chores because I work remote**",

        "selftext": "I (f26) and my fianc\u00e9 (m30) are getting married later this year and we've recently began sending out the invitations. We've said from the beginning that we're only inviting partners of family members if we know them and that we're not going to be inviting partners that we don't know or are in fairly new relationships. We hand delivered invitations to my fianc\u00e9's family and invited some partners (that we know and get along with well and have essentially been a part of the family as they've been around for a while), but other partners that we do not know have not been invited. I will note however that we haven't invited my mils partner as he's awful to my mil and we just do not like him for many reasons. Today we went to visit my fianc\u00e9's grandparents and before we were able to properly greet them his grandmother began yelling at us that were horrible for not inviting his cousins partners (who we do not know and they've not been together for more than a couple of months) and that we're selfish for not wanting to pay extra money to invite them all and that family should come first regardless of how long they've been family for  We told her that we have invited all immediate family but not the people we don't really know and I told her it wasn't her place to decide who should and should not get an invitation to our wedding. She then began yelling at me claiming that we were treating my family better than my fianc\u00e9's and that I'd probably invited more people from my family than his (not true there are immediate members of my family who we are not inviting), she then called me an awful dil to my mil as mils partner isn't invited, as I said previously he's abusive to mil and just makes me incredibly uncomfortable.  So are we the arseholes for not inviting everyone's partners to our wedding? Edit: long term partners, fianc\u00e9's ect are invited it's just short term partners that we do not know with the exception of one that aren't invited.  This is the case for both sides of the family not just my fianc\u00e9's, as I've already seen a few comments implying that I am treating my fianc\u00e9's family different to my own, we are not and after the wedding it's one family and I'm already treating it as such. We have a budget that can accommodate 70 people, we've invited immediate family and some very close friends, we've been prioritising those who we really want to share our day with, and not put ourselves into severe debt. I don't want to not invite some family and close friends to accommodate plus ones we have never met. Edit: I realised I've only used the term plus one however every single invited has incorporated names only so everyone is a named guest and we've not give. Any plus ones plus ones I'm not sure if that will change anything however.",

He bought it so I could play my sims 4 game that I hadn\u2019t played in many months due to my laptop breaking. He and I talked about prices, (I make 1/3rd of his yearly salary).I told him I could give him $300 dollars which is what I had gotten for Christmas. As well as $200 when I got paid next (which I paid). When we went to the store he decided on a 2TB PC ($1,299) instead of the less expensive 1TB one ($849) we had originally decided on. At first I wouldn\u2019t want to play on a daily basis I had to get back into the swing of gaming again (if you game lmk if you do this too). Now I am wanting to play more often, maybe 2-4 hours daily or every other day (it\u2019s random). (Btw we bought the PC on December 28th 2024 so one month ago). My boyfriend says it\u2019s not my PC it\u2019s OUR PC which I agree. He plays every night until 1-2am, I play usually between 4pm-9pm. I have to fight with him every day on whether I play or not. The kicker is he has an Xbox which yes Is outdated but now he doesn\u2019t play it at all since he bought me the PC. \u201cThe graphics are too bad\u201d I want to mention as well, he plays call of duty on the PC with an Xbox controller. He keeps telling me to pay up if I want to be on it more I told him we agreed for me to pay what I paid and the rest was a gift. I am so appreciative for him buying this and letting me use it).

        "selftext": "For background info: I (17F) go to my local gym almost daily. There is a man who goes to my gym (maybe 48F) who always seems to want to converse with me. Last time, he stared at me smirking as I was trying to workout, so I gave him a rude look, hoping he\u2019d look away but instead he told me I looked angry and said I should \u201ctake my anger out on the punching bag\u201d. USUALLY; I go to the gym with a gym buddy, but today I was alone. Today while I was resting between sets, the man walked up to me from across the gym and spoke, but I kept looking down on my phone and I was listening to music. He walked away after I didn\u2019t respond and did a set of hip thrusts. After finishing another set; as I was resting, the man approached me AGAIN and I tried to ignore him. He did NOT walk away this time, so I paused my music and looked up at him. The man asked me if I was missing my friend this time, and if I came to the gym everyday, and why I went to the gym so often. He then proceeded to get on the LAT RAISE machine directly across from me\u2026. I\u2019m an anxious person and very hyper aware, and I took his questions as a way to figure out whether I was alone and vulnerable and when I\u2019d be at the gym. I cut my workout short and left. I was so upset about it, I was worried he\u2019d follow me or something (he did not). I called the gym shortly after and told the staff I didn\u2019t feel comfortable and did not want him to talk to me. She apologized for me feeling uncomfortable, told me she knew exactly who I was talking about, and let me know she had no issue relaying that to him. After relaying this story to my brother who ALSO goes to this gym; I\u2019ve been told that the man could be autistic or something of the sort, thus having a lack in social cues. I understand that, but I still feel like I should be able to workout without feeling anxious or unsafe. note: I did watch him talk to other people as he made his way around the gym; I wasn\u2019t aware that it wasn\u2019t just me, so he really might just be trying to socialize and could be missing social cues. AITAH for complaining to gym staff about this guy who may have some disorder and maybe didn\u2019t intend to be creepy??? ",

Last week she had a panic attack about a bruised knee which was pretty much the only thing she talked about that day (over text). I said some nice things and wished her to feel better several times until I got overwhelmed by her anxiety. I told her that it was unbearable and that I hoped she understands if I take a step back and retain my own space in situations like this. She hasn't talked to me since. I understand that her knee hurts but I'm neither a therapist nor a doctor. AITA? Edit: To be clear, she wasn\u2019t bombing me with texts all day. It was more like, after I responded with nice words and recovery wishes and started talking about something else, she would always revert the topic back to her broken knee.

However, two months into the wedding preparations, I found out that my best friend had been having physical and romantic relationships with my ex-boyfriend. (The man I was dating prior to my fiance). I had dated my ex-boyfriend for about 2 years and throughout those two years she had been cheating with him. Things got a bit heated between me and her after that, but we were able to cool it down after she apologized, things were still tense, but I decided I didn't want to loose my best friend over a guy. I was still recovering from the shock of finding out what she had been doing behind my back, so I decided to demote her from MOH (and replace her with my sister). My best friend was still going to attend as a guest. She was upset at this but accepted. I thought things were good, but, last week, I found out she was talking behind my back and saying unpleasant things (she was calling me ungrateful, a biatch, mean, bratty, and other immature names). I flipped out and uninvited her from the wedding immediately. The wedding was only three weeks away at the time I uninvited her, so she said I messed up all of her plans by doing so. I do feel bad that it was so abrupt, but I didn't feel comfortable seeing her on what is supposed to be my happiest day anymore.  The wedding is on a weekend and the venue is 2hrs away from her house, so she didn't have to take a vacation to attend or anything like that, but I know cutting her out so close to the date was not the nicest move.

I frequently go through slumps of falling out of the gym and when this happens I like to start back up with YouTube\u2019s Emkfit Pilates and HIIT workouts to gain back my stamina and to get remotivated. Every time I play these videos he has always made fun of them and say they don\u2019t do anything. \u201cYou\u2019ve been doing those for years and what have they gotten you?\u201d He said to me today. Today when I got home from workout he was on the couch watching Netflix already as he came home sick from work. I got dresses in my workout clothes and he asked if I was coming to workout in the living room. I told him yes and he left to walk the dog. I was a little over half way done when he came back. He walked into the living room eating a bag of pretzels and started watching. I instantly started messing up and asked him to leave. He knows I don\u2019t like doing these videos in front of him cause I just get flustered and embarrassed. This is when he goes on a rant of how it doesn\u2019t matter and to keep going. I shut down at that point and sit down on the couch pausing the video. He eventually goes into the bedroom but only enough time to turn on the tv and walk back out within 10-15 seconds. \u201cSee I went into the bedroom and you\u2019re still not working out!\u201d Well of course not I knew you were just going to come straight back out which you did\u2026 At that point I grab my phone and go on Instagram. He starts ranting again before going back into the bedroom, and that\u2019s when he says the comment of doing these videos for years and it not doing anything for me.  He tells me I have \u201c2 minutes to start working out\u201d before he comes back.He finally stops talking and I was just going to wait enough time for the Instagram video to finish to restart the workout (wanted to wait atleast a few minutes to make sure he wasn\u2019t going to come back out). Within 1 minute he comes back out and sits on the couch. He\u2019s again going on a long rant about how I\u2019m being a child and so on and so fourth. I don\u2019t say anything, just stare at the tv until it goes into sleep mode. About 8 mins go by. He doesn\u2019t leave. Just stares at me while eating his pretzels. My cat meows from the bathroom (I put him in there to eat his wet food away from our other cat) so I turn off the tv and go to let him out. Now I\u2019m just sitting here in the bathroom typing this out.  So am I the asshole here? I can see where I was being childish, sitting on the couch and refusing to restart until he leaves. And like really leave, not go to the bedroom and continuing complaining to me and then coming straight back out. But wouldn\u2019t that also be childish on his part, refusing to do something his partner asked him to do knowing she doesn\u2019t like it?Side note: I was also getting gassy working out and didn\u2019t want to be ripping ass with him right behind me\u2026. Wasn\u2019t going to tell him that though.",

He will take out the old pod, place it into the sink without dumping out the coffee grounds, and proceed to make his fresh coffee. His reasoning for it is that he is rushing to get ready for work in the morning. I have asked him politely in the past to please dump out the coffee grounds before placing it in the sink. He has always said he would do better, but that day hasn\u2019t come. It has been months of this happening. I casually mention it a couple of times during the week and he apologizes. But today I got stern about it and expressed my frustration about it. he told me I was overreacting and that \u201cit only takes an extra 5 seconds for you to dump it out before doing dishes.\u201d Which then led us to having a petty argument.It isn\u2019t very much the coffee grounds that bother me as it is the lack of promise keeping from him.So, AITA? EDIT: I need to set a couple of things straight.1. I do not use the keurig. I don\u2019t even drink coffee, my husband is the only person who uses it2. \u201cIs this really the hill you want to die on?\u201d I know it seems small and petty. But it is more than coffee grounds. I do all of the chores. I pick up after my husband (he will leave his clothes and even socks scattered in the house). I am usually kind about these instances and I have kept my mouth shut, even though frustration was building. I have kindly asked him to pick up after himself, but I guess he is in robotic mode and just doesn\u2019t think.3. My husband is truly the love of my life, which is exactly why it frustrates me that he won\u2019t pick up after himself when he knows how I feel about it. ",

        "selftext": "I (18F) live with my dad\u2019s family, which includes his younger sister, younger brother, and his mom (my grandmother). My grandma has always been a nightmare to my mom. She constantly orders her around, making her do all the household chores\u2014cooking, receiving packages, cleaning, basically everything\u2014while never asking her own kids to do anything. On top of that, my mom is expected to think of what to cook for my grandma every day, and if she doesn\u2019t pick the perfect meal, my grandma either whines, refuses to eat, or says she\u2019s not hungry anymore. My dad works a lot, and I\u2019ve tried to tell him that his mom treats my mom like a servant, but he just neglects the issue. He doesn\u2019t outright deny it, but he acts like he doesn\u2019t see it happening. I think part of it is because my dad is the eldest son, so he has this weird soft spot for his mom. But at the same time, he\u2019s not doing anything to fix the situation, so my mom just has to deal with it. Tonight, my grandma (who is disabled) asked me to help her up the stairs. She doesn\u2019t need physical assistance, just for someone to stand behind her to make sure she doesn\u2019t tip over. I was busy, so I told my little cousin to do it instead. But honestly, even if I wasn\u2019t busy, I don\u2019t want to help someone who has treated my mom like garbage for years. My mom is physically and mentally exhausted, and it pisses me off that we have to live with my dad\u2019s family when we\u2019re not even well off financially. They\u2019re slowing us down economically, which means my mom doesn\u2019t even get to take proper breaks or vacations. It\u2019s painful to watch. After I told my cousin to help, my grandma started whining to my uncle, complaining that I \u201cpassed my responsibility\u201d onto my cousin instead of doing it myself. And this is just one example\u2014whenever we don\u2019t do exactly what she tells us to, she whines to her kids instead of actually asking them for help. Instead of telling her own children to step up, she just complains to them about how no one is listening to her, which is ironic because she never actually expects them to do anything. edit; thank you so much for the motivating words! i told my mom about this post and it made her giggle fr hahaha. i don\u2019t think she would\u2019ve expected me to write about this or for it to even reach a lot of people. thank you guys, i\u2019ll try all your suggestions and so will my mom! if we can\u2019t get out, i hope at least we can make this house a better place and less toxic. i also wish all the best to everyone, especially those in the same situation. \ud83d\udc96",

        "selftext": "Background - on a flight a few weeks ago, I was seated towards the middle of the plane, behind a very nice family. A mom traveling with her two kids. One was a baby, probably under 3 and the other was a 6 year old. Our flight had been delayed a few times while we were seated on the tarmac, the kids were getting a little restless & a young-ish woman across from them entertained them until we took off. When we got to our destination, it was around an hour or two later than the anticipated arrival time & very early in the morning (1-3 am, can\u2019t recall the exact time). Naturally, people were complaining about missing/making connected flights. The woman who had been helping the family took it upon herself to block the entire aisle until that family had gotten out of their seats and de-planed. Obviously chaos ensued. Some people *mouthed* off to the lady telling her to let them go through, people were questioning what was \u201cholding up the line\u201d among other comments. I overheard the mom (quietly) tell to the lady telling her she didn\u2019t want her to hold the line up & that they were in no hurry to get off. They were sitting down. She also said they normally waited to de-board, as it was easier with the baby. I took it upon myself to politely ask the woman if the rest of us behind her could go since the mom had said she didn\u2019t mind waiting. She turned around and *yelled* at me saying I didn\u2019t know what the mom wanted because I hadn\u2019t bonded (?) with them on the flight, and that a mom would never ask someone to hold up a line but that they\u2019d appreciate it internally, because moms are never respected by the public? I was so shocked I didn\u2019t know what to say because I\u2019d thought I was being polite & had overheard the mom saying it was fine to let everyone else go first. I just wanna know AITA in this situation? I feel like I\u2019m not but that woman yelling at me sure made me feel like I was. Edit: The mom and her kids did eventually get off but it was so awkward because the mom had clearly been prepared to wait, and all of a sudden had to get all of her stuff together and get off the plane, because of what this lady was doing for her. I feel like in that situation it would\u2019ve just been better for the lady to drop the Good Samaritan act because it was doing more harm than good?",

        "selftext": "Growing up with strict parents, Emma (older sister) and I found comfort in each other.I was the rebel and Emma was the perfect daughter. Forced by my parents, Emma chose medicine and I chose engineering. I was meant to do my studies abroad like Emma but because she kept failing, she had to stay back causing financial strain on my father. So my study abroad was cut short.But I graduated and secured a job asap. Got married and settled abroad. Never asked for a penny from my parents from the moment I started earning because I didn't want to pressure my father.  Emma was struggling to complete her studies. I think it is at this point she started to develop a deep sense of entitlement and resentment towards my parents and me.She finally manipulated my dad into renting her an apartment in the city so that she can study better.She would often call me to say she hasn't even eaten properly cause she doesn't have money and I'd send her money right away. Recently my family visited me.Emma visited me earlier than my parents. At this time, I was also expecting a baby. Emma acted like me being pregnant was an annoyance cause I couldn't take her around. regardless I even took her to see the city lights at mid night. My husband was concerned for my well-being and was very upset of how I was being treated.Emma would always come home saying she has no money(even though my father gave her money to spend here).she treated me like atm citing that she has done things for me (organising my wedding) so I SHOULD do everything for her and she sacrificed her youth to take care of my parents while I built my life here. After my parents came, I realised that she basically gets anything she wants from dad.I even found out that my father has given her much more money than she told me.I was upset.Even when I'm in pain,Emma very nonchalantly asks so where are we going today. That was it for me because I felt that she is treating my unborn child poorly. So I started ignoring her.I did some petty stuff like refusing to wash her clothes in the washer. Seeing this,Dad said he treated both of us equally which is not true at all because they get fancy gifts for her on her birthday but I haven't even received a card on mine for many years.   I don't think she will ever understand that me building up a life in a different country with zero family support was a sacrifice, because my father wouldn't have had the means to spend on her if he sent me money as well.   Recently I lost my beloved father. He wanted me to take care of my mum and my sister. I did speak to Emma during funeral arrangements, things have turned extremely sour.Emma is handling many of my dad's assets that I don't even know about because she wants everything for her claiming that she was the one who took care of him. So yeah, I do not talk to her and She never reached out too.I feel bad because my dad must be very unhappy. AITA?",

        "selftext": "This past weekend, I (22F) was set to have my gf (22F) over to visit. I am still living at my parent\u2019s house while I am in the process of applying to vet school while I work at the local vet. My parents had approved having my long-distance gf (we\u2019ve been together for three years, recently long-distance since I just moved) over for the weekend to visit. She got in a little after 9:30 pm this past Friday. We had dinner, chatted, and went to bed. The next morning, I had a shift at the vet from 8:30-1 so I left early. In the meantime my gf (let\u2019s call her E) hung around and chatted with my parents about the new house and how they were settling in. They ate breakfast together and had a good time.  E had mentioned that she planned to go to Costco and would be gone about 45 mins. My parents were ok with this and let her know how to use our mechanized deadbolt. She left to get me lunch and met up with a mutual friend, who we\u2019ll call L. I had asked my mother about a week ago if L could stop by and get a tour of the house. She agreed. E comes back to the house with L fully expecting me to be back home from work. I was not. I had to stay two hours late because of several emergency cases. I could not answer my phone at this time and it was around 16F outside. E brought L in to use the bathroom and play with my dog for around a half hour. Then she left and went home.  Near the end of my shift I get a text from my mom telling me to call her ASAP. I clocked out and gave her a call. She and my father began yelling at me. They saw L come in on the Ring doorbell and were furious that E \u201clied to them\u201d when they asked her what her plans were that day. When they had asked her this, she was in the middle of texting L and deciding what they were doing. I had told E it was alright that L came in because my mom had ok\u2019d it. I fully thought that I would be home to show her around. She accused E of \u201clying by omission\u201d and not telling her that she would be bringing a \u201cstranger\u201d (she and I have known L for over a year) into the house.  My dad then chimed in and said that we better be gone by the time they get home because he \u201cdidn\u2019t want to see E because he didn\u2019t know what he would say to her.\u201d (My gf heard \u201cdidn\u2019t know what he would \u2018do\u2019 so we\u2019re not really sure). This screaming and berating went on for about a half hour. They constantly blamed E when she did nothing wrong. We packed up and left. E left a handwritten note to express how sorry she was, and that she never meant to \u201clie\u201d to them.  It was all just a big misunderstanding. My mom, who usually constantly checks on me to see how I am and sends me sweet little texts is completely giving me the silent treatment. We\u2019re set to come back today but I just don\u2019t know what to do/say. I never meant to go against their wishes and I would never blatantly disrespect them like that. I apologized and told them to blame me and not my gf, but they\u2019re not budging. ",

And now my dad is getting a bunch of hate from all of my family about how I'm such an evil person for not giving my aunt money that I didn't know what she was going to use it for.. here's all that happened and why i cut contact and refuse to give her the money:  I had a house fire when I was 12, i lost my mother and brother in it,, the house that burnt down my parents didnt own that house, my aunt bought it, my parents paid rent plus all the bills, my aunt didnt get house insurance (WE THOUGHT SHE DID) so we got no money nor the Decision to keep the house up, During this time my dad was in surgery, so he was healing at the hospital  I went to go live with The aunt who had bought the house for us, That same aunt tried stealing me from my dad As in trying to get custody over me she lost, after my dad got out of the hospital we went and lived with a different aunt, we had my other other aunt start a gofund me, we raised alot of money but the aunt who started it stole most of the money from it, only giving my dad half, when we found out we moved from my other aunts house to an Apartment, we moved to a house we're I moved out, I'm in college I live in the Dormitory, So with All this being said, AITA? Edit: The reason why my dad hasn't cut ties is because he's worried it will backfire on him, and he wants our family to be able to ask him for help. the reason why my aunt came to me for money is because I was a rug (I let people walk all over me because i felt no self worth) when I was 12-18, and because I hadn't talked to her in two years she thought I'd still be easily manipulated and the same. Edit 2: My dad is telling me I either give her the money or he cuts contact with me? He's choosing his sister who stole from us rather than me, his only daughter. My older brothers are saying just cut him off and ignore him till he comes back to reality... I might have to give in on the money, I don't want to lose my dad... I don't have enough money, I'm thinking of working overtime at my job and selling some of my artwork... I'm not sure what to do.. I can't believe he's doing this because of family's family. I get that, but she's no family of mine, and I owe her nothing. Edit 3: I'm not giving in, I texted my dad telling him you need to come back to reality, your siding with a snake who stole from us after losing my mom and brother. Then I blocked him on everything.",

        "selftext": "I'm (31f) a head teacher at an academy in S.K. I taught here in 2021 & I've been back for 3 months. My 3 US coworkers all came last Aug. Unfortunately, the head teacher before me was a pushover and the other two women (Lucy 27, Cindy 23) asked that I be more assertive since John (late 30s/m) tends to steamroll everyone. In my presentation class we needed to talk about the rubric for their final projects so I needed them to really focus well. John teaches this group the hour before me. Previously he tried to bring very messy snacks to my Lit class. I asked him to please not take snacks to any teachers classes unless you've spoken to them about it. Today he made a bag of popcorn and started putting it in little bowls. Before I went to class I asked him you're not planning on bringing that to my class are you? And he replied with no I'm not. 10min in class the door opens, here he comes with popcorn and the kids go nuts. I tell them no and I follow John back to the door. I say I just asked you if you were bringing it to the class and you said no but you did it anyways. That's so disrespectful. It took a couple min to settle the kids but they didnt grumble about it after I said they can have the snack after class. Class is over, John is out in the hallway giving the kids popcorn and I go to the teachers office. I say to my coworker Lucy, I can't believe he still tried to bring them popcorn when I asked him if he was and he said no to which she responded and why can't they have a snack??. I said first of all, there are signs in all the classrooms that say no eating during class and second, I said no because I needed them to focus on lesson and that should be reason enough. When John came back in the office I asked to speak privately. I told him that it was disrespectful for him to bring snacks when I had already asked if he was and he had said no. His response was I told you no because that bag had gotten kind of burnt and I wanted to make more. I thought you were only asking if I was taking THAT bag of popcorn. I was lowkey floored? We talked 2 weeks ago about not bringing food to classes without asking first and why would I mean that one specific bag of popcorn? He started yelling about how he was just trying to do something nice. I explained to him that I understand that he is doing something kind for the students but he's also not the king of the academy and he can't come into classes in the middle of lesson without asking first. There was a little more back and forth but by the end he said he understood. Now I'm still thinking about it. It was literally just popcorn but it just feels like the principle of the matter? I feel like maybe ITA because I didn't directly say do not bring them snacks because I need to go over really important material at the start of class but usually we finish early so it's okay at the end of class. Lucy's reaction is also making me feel like I over did it.",

        "selftext": "I've been a long-time lurker and this is my first post, none of my other friends understand my situation (they got assigned single rooms) so I'm hoping to get a nuanced answer from Reddit. So I (19) share a room with Sara (19) in our college dorm. By sharing a room, I mean we live in a 12ft x 18ft room with two beds on either side. it's a co-ed floor, tho the rooms itself are single gender and there are separate washrooms/showers for men and women. We're allowed to have guests stay over, up to 3 nights a month so as long our roommate is ok with it.  Once a week for the past couple months my roommate's bf has been driving over to hang out with her once a week. This is fine, i didn't mind at first because they would go on cute dates outside but now it's getting super uncomfortable for me. So now that it's cold outside they're just in the room watching movies and hanging out all day. This means I have to either sit there awkwardly (which is unpleasant and awkward for the both of us) or I have to leave and find somewhere to go. Sara's never kicked me out but I can tell she would prefer if I left and it's uncomfortable for me to stay anyways.  Last Friday, I decided to talk to her and asked her what she and her boyfriend were doing the next morning and she said they were going to watch a movie and stay in. At this I asked her if she could go somewhere else with him. She seemed really confused and I explained to her that I felt kind of awkward being a third wheel and like i was intruding on them (they're super PDA as well). Sara got really mad and said that her half of the dorm was hers and she could do as she liked with it. I didnt know what more to say so I ended the convo. Her boyfriend came over yesterday and I think she told him I didn't like him there because he looked really awkward and I just ended up leaving. i also heard Sara on the phone to him in the hallway and she was joking about how I was probably in love with him and/or jealous of her. Now I feel kinda shitty and I'm regretting saying anything. What is dorm etiquette? Am I missing something?",

        "selftext": "My sister (34F) and I (32F) have a complicated relationship due to our narcissistic mother, but we\u2019ve bonded in adulthood. We both have ADHD and mental health struggles. Eve doesn\u2019t really have close friends besides me, whereas I\u2019ve built a small but solid circle since meeting my fianc\u00e9 in 2017. We\u2019re having a relaxed weekend wedding at holiday cottages (\u00a3190pp). My maid of honour and I fell out this year due to her being in an abusive relationship. Eve never liked her and quickly offered to take over planning my hen do. I was grateful but worried, as she isn\u2019t the most organised. Originally, my MOH planned a weekend away (\u00a3300+), which Eve criticised as too expensive. So I was surprised when she arranged a trip to Amsterdam for \u00a3350pp. She assured me eight were coming and 20 for a local hen do. I trusted her. Time passed, and I had to chase her for details. She said it would be booked on Jan 17th but didn\u2019t mention that everyone dropped out due to cost\u2014leaving just me, her, and one bridesmaid. When the 17th came and nothing was booked, I asked what was going on. She admitted it was just us three, and I said not to bother with Amsterdam. She got defensive, saying she couldn\u2019t force people to come. I never expected that\u2014I just expected her to make it affordable, which she didn\u2019t. After criticising my MOH for cost, she planned something even more expensive. I know Amsterdam is somewhere she\u2019s always wanted to go, and I feel like my hen do became more about that than what I wanted. She accused me of caring more about quantity than quality, which wasn\u2019t true at all. It wasn\u2019t about numbers\u2014it was about having my friends there, which she completely overlooked. She left the hen chat and blocked me on WhatsApp. A few days later, I heard she was struggling with her daughter, so I tried to reach out. She ignored my calls, and when I finally got through via iMessage, she said she didn\u2019t want to speak to me because I\u2019d called the hen do a car crash (which\u2026 it kind of was, considering some girls didn\u2019t even know about Amsterdam). Since then, I\u2019ve planned my own hen do\u201412 of us are going to a cottage with a hot tub for \u00a3140pp. I didn\u2019t want to fall out, so I had a bridesmaid add her back into the chat to see the new plans. She left immediately. I texted her, asking if she was coming to the hen do or wedding, since she still hasn\u2019t paid for her accommodation (due in December). No response. Now I don\u2019t know what to do. I haven\u2019t lashed out or been cruel, and I don\u2019t feel like I deserve this treatment. People keep telling me to reach out again, but I already tried. I don\u2019t see why I should keep bending over backwards when she\u2019s the one who blocked me. I need to decide whether to tell the venue we have two fewer guests. If I don\u2019t, I\u2019m stuck paying for her and my niece. If I do, then this argument might be the final straw for our relationship.",

        "selftext": "Hi All, My dad calls me often when he\u2019s been drinking or high. When I see his number, I know what it ultimately is for - money. Context, I grew up in a large family and my dad was rarely in my life. He and my mom were constantly fighting; he would beat her and we would need to move to get away from him. He always found his way back to us. He wasn\u2019t a great father figure. He didn\u2019t provide for us and neither could my mom. So, we grew up poor.  I never really liked him. I thought of him as a terrible father and human being, but as he\u2019s gotten older, he\u2019s softer and I am at the age where I get to see his personality. Maybe it\u2019s because he\u2019s in his 60s and I\u2019m in my 40s that we can have the relationship we have. You see, I don\u2019t have the energy to argue with him, and he\u2019s too old to be petty (like he used to be). So, our conversations are about life and what to look out for as you get older. He tries to go down memory lane, but I hate it because he\u2019s only able to talk about the years when I was in grade school (ages 0 - 10). He\u2019s picked up on it and doesn\u2019t bring up the past as much. Anyway, I\u2019m an engineer and I make a great living. My wife is a professional in health care and she earns a great living, too. Together we make $46k per month. I would say we\u2019re a middle class family with a middle class lifestyle. Why is this important? Because when my dad calls, he always asks for money. The money isn\u2019t a lot. It is usually $100 dollars. He calls every other day. Now I hate giving him money because 1) it feels like he use me as an ATM 2) he takes the money to go buy drugs and alcohol and 3) I have a feeling the asks are going to get larger. He\u2019s always talking about moving in my home (he says it\u2019s a joke, but I know it\u2019s not).  One day while we were on the phone he said, \u201cSend me $100 since I know you have it\u201d, and I said \u201cI\u2019m not going to send you any more money\u201d. He then tells me \u201cI know you\u2019re going to send it because you always do\u201d. Now, he\u2019s right because even though I say I\u2019m not, I\u2019ll still cash app him the money. I\u2019m upset with his presumption about what I\u2019ll do. This has irritated me so much so that I\u2019ve stop answering his calls the last few days. When I went over our expenses for the year (this is only because we\u2019re preparing our taxes), I noticed that I\u2019ve given him close to $20k for the year. Again, it doesn\u2019t harm our finances, but $20k is a lot of money.  AITA for cutting him off and no longer taking his calls and sending him money? ",

As soon as I said this, she got upset, saying that I'm treating her as a second option. My sister and my girlfriend have not met yet, which could be a reason for her being upset as well. I would ideally like for us to all go, as my sister and I have a bond over this artist and I obviously want my girlfriend to be present as well. AITA here?",

        "selftext": "Husband found a neighborhood dive bar with a pool table.  I don't drink much, but I like pool and we haven't gone to play for a long time.  I'm not good at it.  But it's fun.  So he hints around that he wants to go out, and after some back and forth he asks if I want to go to the bar. (Honestly at first it seemed like he didn't want me to go, and I was okay with staying home.). Anyway, I agree and we head out.  It's not far away and I even commented that I could be designated driver. For some reason that seemed to make him uncomfortable, but he brushed it off and off we went.  So I order my one drink, he gets his beer and some quarters and we play some pool.   Somewhere around the second game, an older guy at the bar starts critiquing my game, telling me which ball to shoot for, etc.  By the time we're into the third game and he's making his helpful suggestions, I stop and ask him (verbatim) excuse me, if you were playing, would you like someone to tell you how to play?. He took a second, said no, but you're bad at it.  I said I know, and took my shot.  Pretty tame?  At least I thought so.  Husband asks what I said to the guy so I told him... And he was upset!  Said I shouldn't have been rude.  We finished that game, I lost again and he wanted to leave.  He said I was rude, the guy was drunk and I should have ignored him.  That we were there to spend time with each other not get into a bar fight.  I said I was sticking up for myself and I think it's despicable that he'd be mad at me for that.  That I don't need him to stand up for me, and nobody was having a bar fight... But taking a strangers side over mine, calling me RUDE (I don't think I was rude) and really picking a fight with me makes him TA.   What do you think internet strangers? ",

I worked harder than either of them and everyone understood it.  The business grew rapidly and as they did well my salary stagnated and I was seldom acknowledged.  A lack of ethics was a constant problem that we disagreed over often.  It came to a head when I refused to lie for them to an important employee on my staff.  They had promised him something they had no intention of fulfilling.  I was suspended and forced to resign so that I\u2019d be entitled to no severance or unemployment. I didn\u2019t fight this.   When I quit my brother told me that I was allowed to go into any business other than the same type of business we were in together.  He said that if I started a similar business this would violate the spirit of our fraternal bond and would be seen as a hostile act. He maintained that it\u2019s inappropriate to compete against family members.  Our market is vast and there\u2019s plenty of room for new companies.  I offered him a non compete agreement protecting his geographical region and precluding myself from using any of my existing contacts.  I thought this seemed fair but he rejected it saying that any entry into the market on my part would not be acceptable.   Am I the asshole for starting a similar business?  Would I be the asshole for going directly after his clients now that he has rejected my offer?  ",

I was looking for something quick to eat at home and saw it in the freezer. Figured she wasn\u2019t going to eat it since it had been 2 weeks at that point so I baked it and ate it over a couple days. Today she looks in the freezer and asks where her pizza is. I told her I ate it cuz it had been there for a while and I didn\u2019t feel like going to the store last weekend. She called me a big back and an asshole. Said that she would have never eaten mine (when I cooked mine was the same day I bought hers and she took half of it when I had it cooling on the stove) and that I would be just as upset. And yeah. Like maybe 8 years ago I would have been upset if I had bought myself something and someone had taken it, but I haven\u2019t done that since we first got together nearly a decade ago. She is literally ignoring me now over a frozen pizza. I even got her a new one at the store and she is refusing it. I just think the whole thing is ridiculous.

        "selftext": "So i (15f) have a best friend (also 15f), who got a moped last summer, after turning 15. We had fun summer riding it together and going to places and so on. One day she sends me a message telling me how her dog had peed on her helmet, because she had left it on the floor. She comes to pick me up from my house the same day and complained, how the helmet is ruined, and how it still smells like dog pee even after she had washed it. After she had picked me up, we decided to go to her place. After the whole day of complaining about the helmet, she told me that her parents went to get her a new one. I was a bit shocked, because the helmet did cost a 150$ and they didint really try that hard to get the smell out. Then she told me that she was just gonna throw the old helmet away, so i asked her if i could have it, since my helmet is old and pretty scratched and i tought that i could atleast try to get the smell off of it. She told me that i could have it and !keep in mind that i asked if she wants any money for it and she said no! She even asked her mother if it would be okay and her mom also said yes. I asked her few times if she is 100% sure that she wants to give it to me and that she doesn\u00b4t want any money for it, and she kept saying yes. I was very happy that i finally had a new helmet and when i got home i immediately washed the helmet twice and also left it to my balcony for a week just to get the smell out of it. Finally it worked. I completely got the smell off the helmet. The next day when me and my best friend were hanging out again, i told her that i got the smell out of it. for my suprise she wasn\u00b4t happy for me. Infact she actually asked it back. She said that it is still hers and that she actually wants to sell it now. I was really shocked and i refused to give it back to her, because she had gave it to me. I told her that i could have gave her some money for it, but she didn\u00b4t want it. She just kept on saying that i should give it back, because she wants to sell it and that it is still her helmet and stuff like that. I still refused, because i was the one who got the smell off of it and kept pointing out the fact that she had gave it to me. We have had couple of small arguments about this even after summer and now i really just need someone elses opinion. So please tell me Am i the asshole? P.s Im sorry if there is a lot of mistakes. English is not my first language.   UPDATE:  So thank you to everyone who has told me some good ideas what to do. Today i started talking to my friend about the helmet again. I wanted to see how she reacts and what she woud say, so i just said something like i will buy new glasses to wear with the helmet you gave to me. After saying that she said no i will take it back. We had an argument again and i told her that she literally gave it to me and that im the one who cleaned it. She then said that she could give me like 20$ for it, but that it wasn\u00b4t a gift and that after she had gave it to me her mom had said that she could have sold it. I told her that she had literally given it to me. So it basically was a gift. After this argument we both were kind of giving eachother silent treatment while we were walking back to her house. We had made plans earlier this week that we would go to the gym after school and we had been talking about it even at school. Suddently when we are walking to her house to get her gym clothes, she suddently says im tired so i won\u00b4t come to the gym. I was really pissed because an hour ago she was not too tired to go. I was getting really annoyed so i said fuck you and turned around.  And for everyone saying that if i give it back i should pee in it first, i definetly will. The first thing i will do is just not talk about it and if she mentions it i will just keep telling her no.' If that doesn\u00b4t work i will pee in it or make my dog pee in it and then give it back.  Thank you everyone who has responded to this!! ",

        "selftext": "My cousin S and I were incredibly close since childhood, despite our five-year age gap. We were confidants\u2014or so I thought. Last July, S started dating A, and their relationship accelerated rapidly. A, recovering from a difficult breakup, seemed like a breath of fresh air. They decided to marry just 4-5 months into their relationship. Her parents initially opposed the match. I supported S, believing A was a good person. I even argued with her parents, and my mother\u2014S's aunt\u2014also fought for her within the family. S had lived with us for over a year during her studies, during a time of significant financial hardship. My mother showed her extraordinary care, arguably more than she demonstrated towards her own children. After months of drama, her parents finally blessed the marriage. Then, S dramatically changed. She became self-absorbed, obsessing over her wedding while excluding everyone. It felt like she used our family to get what she wanted and then discarded us. During this period, two young family members passed away. In our culture, such losses typically mean avoiding celebrations for a year. S showed no emotional response and set her wedding date merely 8-9 months after their deaths\u2014an action many found extremely insensitive. Her behavior grew increasingly hurtful. She got engaged without inviting me or my mother, claiming it was a surprise\u2014despite numerous relatives and friends being present. She visited my city multiple times, deliberately avoiding including me. She scheduled her wedding the day before my brother's critical board exams, knowing he would need my study support. Her communication became manipulative. She'd send lengthy midnight messages portraying herself as struggling and lonely, repeatedly asking if I was upset. She changed her bachelorette venue last minute, ensuring I couldn't attend, and instead went out with friends. These actions made me feel she was more interested in maintaining a facade of closeness than genuinely being present in our relationship. Considering these circumstances, I've decided to skip her wedding. In Indian wedding culture, RSVP isn't standard, so I plan to make a last-minute excuse. Am I the asshole?",

I talked to my parents and they said he needs to go in and see a doctor because if it\u2019s strep it could spread to his heart or kidneys, so i told him we need to go to urgent care and get tested. his family is lower income so i offered to pay for all expenses his mom was against going to the doctor (i didn\u2019t know) she wanted him to just take Tylenol and rest, I pushed for the doctor and he left without telling his mom, he picked me up and we went to urgent care we checked in I talked to the nurse she said we needed parental consent before they did any test (I had called before hand and asked if a minor could come in for a testing and they said nothing about parental consent for anything) so Ashton called his mom and handed me the phone since he can\u2019t speak so I asked his mom if she could give consent for the strep test she hung up on me as soon as I asked, so we called his dad next no answer. The nurse told us we should go to the ER because they don\u2019t need parental consent and she was worried because of how swollen his throat is. we left and he took me home and then he went home. his mom told him that \u201cif you dont respect me then you can pack your shit and live with her\u201d her being me. I understand his mom being upset with him leaving and going to urgent care with me and then just getting a call asking for consent on a test but at the same time it\u2019s her son and she should put his health over everything and now i just feel like she hates me and i don\u2019t know what to do to make things better. My dad texted Ashton and told him we would take him to the ER right now and Ashton said no because he would get kicked out of the house if he went so we offered to take him tomorrow while his mom is at work and he told me he doesn\u2019t want to go behind her back which I understand but i\u2019m very worried for his health and i just want him to feel better i\u2019ve spent the last two nights with him taking care of him and I know how much pain he\u2019s in I just don\u2019t know what else to do or how else to respond to this situation.   UPDATE: (his mom not wanting him to go in is not for any religious reasons)  His mom said she would take him this weekend if he doesn\u2019t get better but i am worried that it will be too long and things could get seriously dangerous for him i can\u2019t even see the back of his throat when i check.

        "selftext": "I 40 yo female and my husband 41 yo male have a constant battle over the temperature of the house during the winter heating season. I would ideally keep the house 65-70F unless it is super cold outside in which case I might go as high as 72-74F. The higher temp would be a rare exception for me. I do typically like to be cooler overall and wear fewer layers and lighter fabrics. He prefers to be warmer overall but wants to be able to lounge around the house in a t-shirt and sleep shorts when he is in for the evening. He rather adamantly insists that he is the sole controller of the thermostat of which there is only one for the whole house. He says growing up that he never had any choice in the temperature of his home and that as an adult he will always have the choice and control. This means that the thermostat has a locked out range of 72-80F and he typically maintains it at 77-79F and is \u201ccomfortable.\u201d He will occasionally make changes when I tell him how miserably uncomfortable I am at that temperature but his concession is typically only a couple of degrees to perhaps 76F.  He feels that my perception of it being too hot is entirely hormonal/physiologic and that I am being ridiculous with my complaints. He regularly asks me if I am menopausal or pre menopausal. I acknowledge that I take many medications following treatment for cancer a couple of years ago and do have a heat intolerance but the intolerance doesn\u2019t MAKE me hot nor do I ask for an unreasonable temperature correction. We are both overweight and actively working to lose weight. So I don\u2019t feel that that is as much of a factor as we both have that variable at play. I can only take so many clothes off but he doesn\u2019t feel he should be expected to wear additional clothing or use a blanket.  I am really struggling to not feel devalued in the choice to keep the house so hot. I will get so hot while cooking to the point that I need to open the windows and he gets very upset at that but at 79F the furnace runs constantly any way so the windows are only making me more comfortable in a hot space and not wasting energy/costing extra.  Am I being unreasonable/petty in my ask? AITA for opening the windows or am I justified in this frustration. For reference during the summer he will run the AC once the outside temp is hitting the 80\u2019s and will keep it at around 72-74F which is typically ok to warm for me but I can usually deal with that pretty well because at least it is cool air.  When he is away for at least several hours I turn the heat down as low as the settings allow or shut it off just for a break. This is the only time I adjust the thermostat. ",

I have been dating my girlfriend for just over two years. However, prior to meeting my girlfriend, I was married/dating to my ex for almost 10 years. We were high school sweethearts, but ended up divorcing about 4 years ago. The divorce wasn\u2019t bad, but it was a divorce so it wasn\u2019t easy by any means.

We were there talking and having a good time, when I noticed my ex at a table with her new husband at a table on the other side of the brewery. We made eye contact, so I simply smiled and lifted my beer in a \u201ccheers\u201d motion to her, and she did the same. I never left my seat or even thought about it. My girlfriend saw me do this, and noticed who it was too, and kept talking to my buddies. Didn\u2019t think anything of it. Well we got home that evening and I got torn a new one\u2026how dare I do that in front of her and disrespect her. I responded that it was simply acknowledging her and nothing more!

        "selftext": "My husband (M36) and I (F32) have an 18-month-old daughter and a son on the way.  I'm a good wife and easy-going. I've been the breadwinner our entire relationship. I make $250K and pay the majority of our bills. I keep myself in amazing physical shape, work out daily, and still have visible abs 22 weeks into my second pregnancy. I also handle the household responsibilities (cooking/cleaning) and 99% of the childcare (my husband has fed our daughter maybe 2 meals and given her as many baths in her short little life.)  Husband had promised me he was going to make dinner last night. This was a very rare thing and I was excited for it. He calls me 3 hours before he's due home asking if I'd mind if he cooked tomorrow instead so he can go to his buddy's after work. This particular friend is an unmarried and childless pothead which is fine, no judgment. But every time my husband comes back from hanging out with him he is stoned out of his mind. I accept his weed use and don't complain about it (except when he does it in the house because we have a toddler and I'm pregnant) but he comes home half dead after these hang outs.  I honestly tell him I was looking forward to dinner so I'm disappointed and wish I had known earlier but of course he can go.  He gets home around 7 and I wasn't exactly thrilled to see him. We wake up this morning and he tells me he feels unloved and that it's a huge problem that I'm passive aggressive any time he wants to hang out with his friends. To be fair, this is kind of true. We lived in downtown Chicago when we met and I gave up my entire life to move to the middle of nowhere to be by his family. He has tons of friends here and despite my best efforts I only have 1. So I'm lonely, and I miss my old life at times. I told him that he can't expect me to be elated to have him come home all stoned when I have to be sober/pregnant and doing the majority of the household tasks. I told him he could work on catering to me more during pregnancy (I often ask for back rubs and he has never once given me one.)  He freaked out on me, told me this isn't transactional, told me I'm annoying to ask for back rubs and to give it a rest, and then to add insult to injury said my job was easy. Which is funny because if it's so easy it would be great for him to go out and earn the same money that I make as he makes less than half of what I do and I'm real tired of being the provider and the homemaker.   Anyway, this is when I tell him that grown men with kids do not go get stoned with their buddies after work. They come home and be with their families.  Apparently this was so egregious he left for the day without saying goodbye. He acts like I prevent him from having any friends which isn't true. I always encourage him to see his friends and go on trips and on and on. But I will admit that I can be passive aggressive about it just because I don't ever get to do the same kinds of things.  I am so curious to know, AITA? ",

        "selftext": "I'll try to make a long story short;My BF has been talking over and over about the ACP (affordable connectivity program) for Internet maybe once a month for probably a year after a coworker told him about it. Problem is, it was cancelled by the government early last year. I know because I was in the program! I've told him this every time he's brought it up, starting out gentle and with something like maybe you should look up options, I'm sure there's something.  And then it repeats. Last night I told him he should message a friend with my phone that he'll be late because his phone was off and she'll think he ditched her. He says Noooo, I would never ditch her, she knows that! (He's literally slept through a dinner we were supposed to have before he left the state so I didn't believe him tbh).  He gets home, internet connects to phone, and boom, flood of messages, I was right. Now might be TA because I said I told you so and I'm not even ashamed to say that because I always say things like this and you never listen. Poor [friends name]. That sucks. He didn't seem bothered, kinda half joked it off. We keep talking and he brings up the ACP again. I honestly feel gaslit at this point especially because he says I really need to sign up for that and *I think you qualify*I very frustratedly told him pretty much what I typed up. That I've told you about this like five times before, that I was on it, the Internet company barely wanted to follow it anyway, and that the program was cancelled. Lady's and gentlemen, he brushed me off.  So I got frustrated and just googled it and read him the Wikipedia article. The acp program ran out of funding in April 2024. Etc.. yada yada...  He basically broke and said So I'm just screwed?!?. I said I w tried to tell you this before and you didn't listen to me. The rest of the phonecall he kept saying what?? It felt like anytime I talked so I got frustrated and hung up since he just said he was about to go to bed anyway. Definitely a bitch move. He won't respond this morning. So I'm TA for the end I think, but was there a better way to handle the rest?",

        "selftext": "I have no clue how to start this so here we go, I am 27 years old, work seasonally at a beach club/music festival around the US as a bartender/server. When I was around 13-14 my aunt with two disabled children(who are now 21)asked if I would be willing to take a job with the agency she goes through for the children's benefits The deal she explained to me was she would put the hours in and collect the checks at the end of the week but come tax season I would make out great with taxes. unfortunately, at the time my mother was in the midst of her addiction and wasn't there to explain the consequences of what this could bring, at 13 I agreed to what my aunt was asking, not fully aware of what it meant. I tried filing the taxes probably three times with the w2s from both of the children and ended up owing or getting nothing back because I was working when she was claiming I worked for her as well. when I was 21, I demanded that she stop claiming wages in my name. she told me she had done so and stopped, again I owed on taxes. so, to my knowledge for the past 6 years she was not claiming wages in my name after I said stop like I said before my work is seasonal for the most part with bartending festivals and the beach club only being open summer-late fall, HR suggested to file unemployment since they had to push our reopen date back a month. when I applied for unemployment the woman, I was speaking to informed me that I had wages in another state from my aunt's children, my wages in all states will be looked at and sent to me for review that was three days ago. that paperwork came in two days ago it showed within the last year my aunt has claimed $61,568 in my name. I immediately contacted her through text (I have been refusing to speak on the phone in case I need messages documented) and begged to know why she didn't stop when I asked her 6 years ago to stop since those wages potentially made me ineligible for unemployment, I did find out today that I will be getting unemployment based off those wages as well. the woman I spoke to said I'd be getting more for unemployment because of those wages. Since she has been claiming that amount for that long in my name plus, I haven't filed the taxes because I had no idea that she was still doing it. she did say again she would stop but she didn't last time. My mother is freaking out on my aunt. my 80-year-old grandfather has called to see what is going on and I was honest with him but he's just trying to do damage control so no one will report my aunt. I don't want her to get arrested, but I cannot pay the taxes that are owed. she has reached out and told me to do the taxes and she will take care of them. but the point is she should have never kept going to begin with, I agreed and said I wouldn't be paying the taxes she would as soon as I find out how much they are, as well id appreciate financial help since she's been doing this to me for years. AITA for calling her out and expecting her to make it right",

        "selftext": "Hello all! I am seriously wondering whether or not I am the AITA! Some background, I (21 f) held my birthday party this weekend! I invited quite some people and it was quite fun! A friend of mine (30 m) was also invited, I would like to add that he was already on quite some thin ice, to make it simple I will refer to him as Bob We share 2 mutuals friends (21 f) and (25 m) to make it simple I will refer to them as Lynn, and Jeff. We used to be quite close all three, having Lynn move into my appartment complex made us only closer, unfortunately Bob decided to make a new groupchat purely to not include me. When confronted he denied of the existence, which upset Lynn due to us being really close and just not liking it at all. Despite all this Bob was still invited to my party, because I didn\u2019t want to make this \u201cbigger\u201d then it was. I rented a location for my birthday, which due to the rain became quite muddy outside and had a lot of gaps in the ground, it was also really dark outside He decided without communicating to me, that he would do a photoshoot on that terrain with some people I also invited, I simply asked them why because a birthday party doesn\u2019t seem like the time nor place to do a photoshoot imo. I wouldn\u2019t mind people taking pictures at all, with phones since I understand taking selfies/videos! But he took all his camera equipment with him, including lights without any communication. I as a photographer myself, would never take my equipment with me, at a private event like birthday parties unless the host asked. Or unless I asked for permission and it was fine My boyfriend kindly asked him to stop, because it was just weird to just shoot on a birthday party without any proper notice. Eventually he came back into the party, looking all upset for the last 3 hours, and just keeping looking at his phone which was just very awkward for all the guests being there. When asked about it by others he kept claiming he was getting \u201ckicked out\u201d which mind you he only got kindly asked to stop, due to the terrain being dangerous etc etc Eventually he left without saying goodbye, or honesty anything I kindly messaged him, because stuff like this wouldn\u2019t have happened if there was any communication. He claimed that \u201che was an adult so he didn\u2019t need to ask for permission, and that he was done getting told what he could do and not\u201d He ended up blocking me and Lynn on everything because he was upset, later I however also find out that he was bragging to my guests about going on a date with a 19 year old, so I don\u2019t know whether I dodged a bullet, or whether I am truly in the wrong.",

        "selftext": " So me and my sister, we get along pretty well. We spend every day together and my mum is also at home every day when she isn't working. My sister HATES sharing. She refuses to share when told or she will give me something if she feels like it and is in a good mood.  I, on the other hand, will share quite regularly and when told (I'll get to that, it's quite important) and she sort of apprectiates it. If i offer her a bite of my food she'll eat like half of it but I don't mind. I'll only tell her absolutely no if it's something special or something I really want.  Now my mum. My sister has a very demanding personality and my mum is more gentle. That leads to my sister being dominating of my mum so she gets what she wants a lot. My mum enables that, so when I tell her no to having, say, one of my chocolates, my mum will force me to give my sister what she wants.  Now, today. So I got a present from my sister, it was a Sanrio mystery bag with sparkly tickers. I like Sanrio so I loved it and I decorated my laptop with them, leaving about 8 or 9 stickers left. My sister wanted some but I said no she can just buy some, I don't see why she needs mine. She's been asking non stop for just one sticker but I said no. Tonight, she asked again for stickers so I said, rather frustrated, no Im not giving you a sticker, stop asking me constantly. I said it in a rude way because she has been asking me constantly for more than 2 months. My mum and sister were staring at me with disgust and my mum said are you even Christian anymore? Jesus says to share. She always brings religion into these things so I said yes mum I am, just because I'm not giving her my stuff doesn't mean I'm not Christian.  My sister ended up calling me names and saying I was immature so I said is it mature to not respect no for nearly 2 months?. My mum started getting angry and called me a f**khead turd selfish b***ch and told me that she wouldn't be taking me anywhere. I told her that was manipulative and she responded with I don't give a flying f**k. It went on for a bit longer and yes I was being rude because im sick of it, my sister gets what she wants all the time and she caused this huge drama over one sticker.  Then my sister came in again saying you're nearly 18, you caused all this over a sticker, you're being so rude for nothing. I got annoyed and said you're nearly 16, you won't respect no. I've been repeating over and over. I told her she's been harassing me and I'm sick of it. She keeps saying I only asked you once so I say no, you've asked multiple times over 2 months but then she responds with I meant tonight and it's really annoying that she asking me more than once when I already said no.  My dad is on my side and told them both it doesn't matter, it's her stickers so why should she have to give it to (my sister) but they both keep saying oh she was so rude but my dad sees why I'm so annoyed.  Anyway idk what to do or if I'm wrong,  AITA?",

I needed a place for my bed to go and his sister needed a bed- we were going to use his bed because his bed is the biggest. She would sleep on the floor or an air mattress at her moms house, which I thought was kind of sad. My boyfriend atm, said he would buy her one but we were both short on money (Teens moving into a new apartment yk) so I figured he could buy her one some other time and she could just use mine.  Well\u2026 we\u2019re approaching the end of our lease. My boyfriend is now my ex boyfriend and I need my bed.  Turns out his sister let her cats pee all over my bed, she got red juice all over the mattress, and the plastic I had over the mattress well she apparently took that off, along with the mattress cover. The bed is ruined, my ex said it, she said it, her mom said.  She said that she would buy me a new one. Turns out she meant a cheap $100 mattress from Walmart. Mind you I got mine from Levin and it\u2019s a Sealy mattress- think 500+ I know I should have considered a bit more when I let her borrow it, but at the moment it worked out for both of us, and who would assume a 18/19 can\u2019t take care of a bed when I did it myself??  She said, \u201cI\u2019m ngl Ik I did mess up the bed and i should\u2019ve taken better care of it but I\u2019m not spending 500 on a bed when there are better beds you can get for way less.\u201d  Her words^ so\u2026 AITA for expecting her to replace the mattress she ruined?!

We meet up at my grandparents' old ranch, roast marshmallows, and catch up on everything going on in our lives. It's been going on for about 20 years, and my parents expect me (25f) to be there every single year without fail.  But my best friend Jenny (26f) suddenly announced she's getting married in two months. Her fianc\u00e9 got a great job offer overseas, so they moved up the wedding before they relocate. The only date available at their venue is the exact same weekend as my family reunion. Jenny asked me to be a bridesmaid, which we've literally talked about doing for each other since we were little kids, so I immediately said yes. I didn\u2019t even think about how my family would react.  When I told my parents and siblings I\u2019d miss the reunion, they got really upset. My dad said he only sees certain relatives once a year at this event. My mom said I was basically ruining the family tradition. Then my older brother called me selfish and warned I'd regret missing these moments when our parents are gone one day. But this wedding really matters to me, and I know Jenny would be crushed if I wasn't there with her.  I even offered to go to part of the reunion before flying out for the wedding, but my brother said there was no point in doing that for just one day and told me I had to pick family over everything else. I hate the drama, but I also don\u2019t feel right abandoning Jenny when this is such an important (and last-minute) thing.  So, am I the asshole for skipping my family reunion to be in my best friend\u2019s wedding?",

However one thing is that she has a really, shall we say, aggressive side to her.  She does a lot of things to me like calling me stupid, a bitch or other names. She loves telling me to shut up. It doesn\u2019t bother me because she's worth it and she\u2019s not always like that. Sometimes tho, she straight up threatens me and blocks me for the tiniest things. I really love talking to her so it really hurts me, but sometimes I think I deserve it tbh. Anyway, now for where it all went wrong. Two days ago, she told me to apologise for absolutely no reason. I already had such a hard long day and then on top of that whatever apologies I gave, never seemed good enough. She kept telling me to redo it and be sincere about it. She said don't repeat the same thing over and over again and no copying and pasting, every letter needed to be typed. I told her I couldn\u2019t write that many sincere apologies but she kept insisting. And then it happened. I ended up calling her a cow. The intention was to use as a reason to apologise which is exactly what she wanted from me. I said it to her and then instantly apologised. At first she seemingly found it funny which was my intention, but then all of a sudden, she said that was her last straw and then proceeded to block me.  I was confused but then the guilt set in. I felt really bad about it, that I hurt her feelings. Maybe I went too far? I thought it was just a harmless funny joke. Tbh I don\u2019t really know where the line is drawn, as she insults me relentlessly yet I never do it. I think I may have really upset her this time. Am I the asshole?",

They have 2 cats that the only thing they do for them is feed them. They both constantly order stuff from Amazon and just throw the boxes into the dining room. I'm talking massive pile the size of a large suv. They occasionally clean, vacuum, dishes, etc. Things that I consider to be at a minimum weekly. The house wreaks of cat piss and mold.  I had a career that left me a bit physically broken. I can still manage day to day stuff but being in a car more than 2 hours really begins to aggravate old injuries. They know this and still want me to go up there to do something like take the trash out and all the other chores.  Here's where I am really having difficulty. My younger brother did live with them and somewhat help with these tasks. I say somewhat because he was an alcoholic and I say was because he died because of it. He was completely dependent on my parents to take him and pay for his alcohol. I didn't know how bad it truly was until he ended up in the hospital and the doctors said he would only have days to live. It ended up only being 1 day and I got there about an hour after he died. I know addiction is a hell of thing to deal with and also know that he ultimately made the choice to drink the way he did. I cannot seem to get the feeling that my parents are at least partly to blame for his death.  Every time I leave that house I feel completely emotionally drained.

        "selftext": "Okay sooo first of all here's some necessary info about this. I'm 15f, freshman in a boarding high school. I share a dorm with two roommates, one which I'm gonna call M and the other one S. We're all the same year. I have ARFID and am anemic, which causes me to be often low on energy.  Sooo like the title says, I'm not going to eat with her. M is always begging me to go and eat (or just wait) there for like 15 minutes. We have three meals every day, breakfast before our school (which starts at 7:30 most of the time), lunch which is like riiight after school, and the dinner which is at 18:00. Usually, S goes with her, but she also has other friends so she often ends up not going with M. I do sometimes go with her, but it's just awkward because I can't really eat most of the things there because of my eating disorder, so I just take the tiny yoghurt and wait there while she or they're eating.  Most of the time when M asks me to go with her, I say no. I just don't have the energy to get ready and go be around people for 20 minutes while she's eating. She keeps asking maany many times,  and my answer is pretty much always no, since I buy myself stuff I like at the store and am not hungry. M, on the other hand, doesn't have as much money so she needs to eat at the caffeteria. Whenever i tell her to just eat without me, she says how she's embarrassed to go there alone. After begging me for a bit, she finally gives up and stops asking, but doesn't end up going to eat at all.  But I'm starting to feel a bit, I don't know.... Bad? Like, she's not eating because of ME basically. I don't know what to do\ud83e\udd79 ",

        "selftext": "So, am I the asshole for asking my sister when I'd be paid back? A few months ago, my mother asked me for a few hundred dollars to go on a trip, promising to give me back an extra $25 for every $100 I lent her. I gave her $400, so she was supposed to pay me back $500. Before she had the chance to repay me, my sister asked to borrow money. Since I was low on cash at the time, I told her she could ask our mother for some of the money she owed me. My sister ended up taking $100, but she never paid me back. Fast forward a few months, and she went to the casino and lost all her money. She called me, asking if I could lend her some. I didn\u2019t know at the time that she had blown it all gambling, but I was already annoyed because she hadn\u2019t repaid me from before. Still, since she has kids, I relented and offered her $100. Her immediate response was, *That's all?* I had already been left unpaid once, and I wasn\u2019t willing to give her more, so I confirmed that $100 was all I was offering. She took it and promised to pay me back on Monday. Three days later, on Monday, I asked her if she was going to pay me back. Instead of answering, she just said, *Why?* I asked again, and she repeated, *Why?* I reminded her that she had promised to pay me back Monday, but she flat-out denied ever saying that. Maybe I misheard her over the phone, but considering she had just bought three subs for $40, I pressed again, asking when she planned to repay me. At that point, she got angry, snapped, *I'm not dealing with this,* stormed out of the room, grabbed the money I had given her, and shoved it back into my hands.",

I do like weed but don't care enough to go to the trouble to procure it, but if someone offers me a smoke, I'm down. My fiance drinks more when he does, drinks more often and harder than I do, but it's not to the extent of having a problem.  My SIL's friend (24F) invited me to hang out with them, go to the beach and drink. I decided why not.  So, we drank a bit, went to the beach, and I got super high. It's been a year since the last time I smoked, so yeah... I was having a great time, everyone was enjoying themselves. Nothing bad happened. The sober one in our group would check on me, people were chatting with me and keeping me company.  I come home, make myself some food, and go to bed. My fiance is sleeping and remains so until he leaves for work.  Now I feel like a piece of s***, because my fiance calls me today, asked me about last night and is mad at me and telling me that his vision of me is tarnished in his eyes because I went out late and got high.  He's saying those are things that ghetto people do, that's not the kind of thing I would do and he thought I was better than that. We've been together for 6 years. I hardly go out. I feel hurt by his judgment. He said I am very easy to peer pressure and that he's disappointed in me.   I've never been opposed to smoking weed and he knows this, but is seemingly judging me for smoking when I had an opportunity. I'm not someone who gets stoned often, and I wouldn't want to be tbh. It's just hurtful that he feels I can't be trusted with myself and it's as if he views me as lesser because of last night.  AITA for getting high with my SIL and friends?",

Well now our insurance has finally settled the claim and decided we are going to get paid out $10,000 for my car. I have had quite a few listings saved on marketplace & Kijiji and I have narrowed it down to a few in the city an hour away. I\u2019m a SAHM so I do not have a bank account so the funds went to my our joint account (my husband is the primary). Now he is saying we cannot spend 10,000 on a car (the car I want is $8000) we should buy this car (a literal junker from 2008) for $4000 because he wants to save the rest of it in case we \u201cget into a bind\u201d. He also keeps bringing up the fact that we could buy the $8000 car and it could have just as many problems as the $4000 one. I know he has financial anxiety from when we were struggling during 2020 but it\u2019s getting so over the top lately. We are not financially struggling and we don\u2019t have huge debt either. I\u2019m strongly disagreeing with this because I want a safe reliable vehicle to drive my two kids (and dog occasionally) around in. I don\u2019t want to constantly worry about it breaking down. (The vehicle that we are currently borrowing from a family member is quite old and has a bunch of problems with it) We have had straight up fights about this in the past few days and honestly I\u2019m tired of it.

        "selftext": "To give a quick back story- I started talking to this guy on a dating app (it rhymes with blinder \ud83d\ude07). Anyway we hit it off real quick, discover we have a lot of the same interests, think really similarly on some pretty divisive issues, and just generally vibe well. I\u2019m enjoying the conversation, we talk pretty steadily through the evening 4-5 hours worth or so. I think he\u2019s cool, we are being authentic and honest- it\u2019s really refreshing honestly.  Before we started talking though I was carrying on a couple conversations with some other guys. Like you do on a dating app lol. None of them were as interesting or seemingly compatible as this guy. But they were good conversations too and you never know what\u2019ll pan out. I\u2019m taking awhile to respond (like maybe 1-2 min) and the conversation proceeds thusly: Him: \u201cAre you busy? We can talk later\u201d Me: \u201cNah just chatting with a couple other folks so having to rotate through the convos\u201d Him: \u201cOh like other guys?\u201d \u201cOuch\u201d Me: \u201cOuch?\u201d \u201cBut yes, other guys\u201d Him: \u201cOkay I\u2019ll leave ya to it\u201d Me: \u201cok\u2026?\u201d Him: \u201cNot great when you\u2019re vibing with someone to hear that they\u2019re talking to multiple guys, as you\u2019re trying to talk to him.\u201d Me: \u201cI mean you asked\u201d \u201cwhat would you have me do? Lie to you?\u201d\u201cI had several conversations going before we even talked. I\u2019m not going to just ignore them\u201d Him: \u201cI\u2019m looking for a relationship. Not looking to waste my time on someone who has to keep conversations with several people hoping one clicks.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m so glad you were honest. Doesn\u2019t make it any less rude and disingenuous\u201d Me: \u201cI don\u2019t see how there\u2019s anything rude or disingenuous about it\u201d\u201cwe literally started talking tonight\u201d \u201cJealousy at this stage is a red flag for sure\u201d Him: \u201cLmao gas lighting? You switched up real quick mate\u201d Me: \u201cI\u2019m not gaslighting you.\u201d Him: \u201cget fucked stud\u201d Me: \u201cit just seems weird\u201d Then he proceeds to block me.  I\u2019m just so confused \ud83d\ude15. He made it clear that he really liked me, kept complimenting my appearance and how crazy it is that we have so much in common etc. and then just gets crazy jealous out of nowhere.  AITA? P.s. Before you say I should\u2019ve just lied to him. I don\u2019t lie, and I\u2019m pretty sure I told him that at the beginning.  tl;dr- guy on dating app, day one, gets pissed I\u2019m still talking with other guys.  **UPDATE- it appears the majority thinks I\u2019m NTA. I have learned how I could\u2019ve handled the situation better. I\u2019m grateful to everyone that responded.  Interestingly, those that felt YTA were almost all very passionate in their responses, way more so than the NTA crowd. Draw whatever conclusions from that you will**",

I picked her up and dropped her off this weekend. Because of the distance, my tiredness, and honestly, the intimidation of it, I had let the car get bad-messy. She took charge and cleaned it with me, and set a rule where I was not to eat in my car. She forgot her wallet and keys at home, so I drove them to her yesterday (Monday) despite her mom's opinion and some tiredness.  Today, I had a dentist's appointment in the morning and dinner with my friend. I decided to run some errands along the way and hit the gym. I had lent her my headphones when hers broke, so I stopped by and grabbed a cheap temporary/backup pair. So, there were a few receipts and the empty box, plus 5 bags in the backseat. I had forgotten to bring a trash bag for the car and planned clear it at home. While I was eating KBBQ with my friend, she messaged me she needed a hug stat and had half-jokingly mentioned she wanted food from her favorite restaurant. She has panic attacks sometimes, so I always want to make sure she feels supported. I wrapped up the evening within 15 mins. I overate badly, but I walked to my car with my friend, said goodbye, and drove to the restaurant (25 mins). I picked up the order, and drove another hour+ to her university. Parked, and brought the food up to her.  I wasn't planning to drive tonight, so I was exhausted and passed out on the couch next to her while she did some work. We drove to a park we frequent because she wanted to. She wanted to lay down. I asked her if she wanted to return to the dorm and she declined, so we napped.  She woke up and wanted to move to the backseat. She told me to clear the backseat, so I did. Then she told me to raise my seat up and switch to hers. I told her I was gonna put the passenger seat down. She was upset I was talking back to her and wanted to return to the dorm.  While driving back, she told me how my car was already so messy again despite how important it was to her. She mentioned the receipts, the bags I had moved, and the nail file up front (I have a bad nail biting habit). I told her I had no idea I was going to come tonight and was planning to clean the car when I got home. She told me my plans are meaningless because I didn't plan well for her birthday (2 months ago). This is something I have apologized for repeatedly, and have tried to make up to her. I tried to explain that the car would have been clean before we had planned to meet, but I was rushing since she told me she needed me stat. I tried explaining I understood her feelings, and tried validating them while staying firm. Argument continued until she was making preparations to leave. I asked her if she wanted me to walk her back. She declined. I told her I loved her, she said something I didn't hear, and she closed the door hard. AITA?",

As per indian traditions i ain't allowed to use my left hand for eating for some reason so yeah and my parents are kinda strict about that and i'm the only leftie in my family so no one knows how it works tbh. About 3 years ago in like 2022 i went for a family dinner where there was another dude who was a lefie and was eating with his left hand pretty much some of the kids over there asked me why i was using my right hand and i told i kinda got used with it. Ps my parents used to bs talk about that kid to me for using his left hand for eating. Later when we went to the room some of em even asked if i yk wiped my butt with the same hand or not. It felt so weird and i could never forget that. Even when i went to Thailand last year with a bunch of family friends some of the kids and adults went to try the street food and i didn't wanna try them cuz my tummy hella sensitive so i just opted for an indian restaurant with the adults and like 2 of my friends, a guy in uni and another girl a year elder to me. The guys mother was with us in a table of four and when i was using my right hand for my knife she asked me why i was using it and her son kinda gave the signal of not asking me about it. It was kinda weird again for like a few mins then it kinda got normal. Fast forward to this year i wanted to change so from like day before yesterday i tried switching to the normal left hand maneuvers and yesterday i started eating with my left hand. Felt hard to eat with it like tearing the roti and shi but yeah i had to get used to it. Today my mom saw me eating with my left hand and she kinda got mad and told my dad. Never seen my dad get this mad and he ruined my entire day. I tried explaining my mom how it works for us lefties but she just ignored me and told no food unless you change how you eat. My parents are quite egoistic so yeah pretty much my situations cooked. Ps just wanted to vent and clear my mind.

I was supposed to stay there from the middle of June until the beginning of July. Now, about 2-3 months prior, I had dislocated my knee and landed on said knee while falling. I also had to sit screaming for help in that position for almost 30 minutes, and then had to wait an extra 15 for my dean to finally come to my room and get me to the hospital--where they told me I had fractured something, I dont really know what, but it was small enough to where it could heal on its own without surgery. At my grandma's she has this huge case of stairs, which im scared to go down due to how unsafe they feel--since they have huge gaps and im scared of falling--but especially since I had just stopped using the cast I had on, my knee sometimes hurt when put under pressure when walking down stairs, running, etc. \u00a0After about 3-4 weeks, I got homesick and decided I would go back early. I wasn't really feeling any semblance of joy based on the past experiences with this side of my family, and it didn't seem like they had changed at all. So, about 4 days after that, I was driving with my grandparents and sister to the airport. I waved my sister and grandma goodbye (grandpa stayed in the car) and was on my merry way. However, while waiting for boarding time, my heart sunk. My sister texted me a video, which I listened to--showing how my grandma was saying in explicit detail how much weight I had gained since they last saw me, and how all that weight must have been why my knee was hurting so much, even though i had stated many times that I had dislocated my knee. I fully went up and texted her, going on a long rant about why she would say things like that behind my back and she couldn't be talking, seeing that she would constantly complain on how big she was. A few minutes later, she saw it--responding basically blaming everything on my sister, and how she shouldnt have told me lies and she was trying to ruin the family by spouting a bunch of BS. I told her that I saw video proof, where she again tried to blame my sister. My sister texted me that my grandma was yelling at her, and honestly I felt even worse. I failed to realize that this would probably effect her standing with our grandma. However we talked it out and she seemed to not care about it because she doesnt wanna be around someone who talks to me like that anyways. My mom also texted me, telling me about how I shouldnt have said anything and shouldve let it go. However, I dont think I shouldve. My grandma has a history about talking to people like this, constantly belittling others and trying to make herself feel good. I thought it was time somebody tell her back on it. So reddit, AITA for telling off my grandma when she told my sister the reason my knee hurt was because of all the extra weight I had on me?? ",

Plus current circumstances make it the most convenient, affordable, least stressful option. It's a good way to ease us both in to her growing and upcoming independence etc. Previously shes been too scared to stay home on her own for even 15 mins in the middle of the daytime. Anyway so I'm not currently comfortable with other kids coming over after school &hanging out in our house unsupervised, For numerous reasons including the above,as well as when shes with friends they tend to behave more irresponsibly so I don't think zero supervision is appropriate yet, plus the friends either dont know or straight ignore the house rules with no adult present to advise,they get more careless with basic safety stuff, plus as she's started high school we are trying to implement a new routine for after school to incorporate homework& all that stuff as well as introducing new responsibilities related to her age & school&expenses etc which friends coming over after school are a distraction blah blah.  Additionally, specific to my niece and nephew, THEY are only 9 and 11.  Anyway I told my mother tonight that moving forward I dont want friends/other kids coming over after school when my daughter is home on her own. And she got offended. She didnt argue with me as such, but she just did a 'face' & didn't reply anything at all and then just continued to leave& didn't say bye or anything. Basically,I know my mother &her reaction means she was offended in some way. I'm not sure what offence she took exactly,but she wasn't in agreeance &it's clear she was annoyed in some way,but she also wasnt willing to explain that to me either.So I'm wondering,AITA here, I mean I know that all families and households are different & have different opinions & expectations of their kids & homes & parenting etc, but is my request THAT extreme, like way out of line or crazy that she should be offended and annoyed at me for even suggesting this ?? I said it in a nice way, not angry or anything like that, I wasn't expecting this reaction so I had no reason to be defensive or anything at that stage,I'm very confused. To be clear, this relates to ALL kids, my daughter's school friends etc as well, its not ONLY my niece and nephew I said shouldn't come over to hang out here unsupervised blah blah. Her school friends parents were ok with it,one of them said she is doing the same at their house so \ud83e\udd37 ",

        "selftext": "TL;DR my wife\u2019s mother told her that she and her dad may not be able to go on our trip, so now she wants to cancel the whole thing. I told her that even if it gets down to just her, our child, and I, we could still have a great time and make great memories. This has turned into a major fight now. I\u2019m on a throwaway because I have family on Reddit and they like this sub. My wife and I randomly and recently decided to plan a rather large vacation that would involve us (wife, child, and I) and bout of our parents. The dates were not set, but we had a general idea of when we wanted to go. I work in a job that isn\u2019t the easiest to get time off with, so I started getting the ball rolling on my end of things to make it easier for when I do have dates. This included changing and planning ConEd dates to allow for the possible window we would be going. Not a problem, just trying to make sure there are no hiccups when more concrete details come through. The other day, she tells me that due to some changes (nothing medical or financial), her parents may not be able to go with us. That soured her mood entirely about the whole thing. She became despondent and finally said that she thinks we just shouldn\u2019t go. I told her that I was sorry about her parents not being able to go, but that shouldn\u2019t stop us from going, even if my parents couldn\u2019t go either. This would be our first family vacation with our child and it would be a chance to make some special memories, especially since he will be about 2 by the time we go. She got quiet and eventually just said good night and walked away. Later on, she texts me about how upset she is by what I have said and that she does not want to talk about this until she is ready because she doesn\u2019t want to say things she doesn\u2019t mean. I have my own opinions about that, but I respected her wishes. I told her that it was not my intention to upset her and that I was sorry that I had.  I just want to know if I am being an asshole because I don\u2019t think we should cancel this trip over one cancellation? I saw this more in the light of it being focused on the three of us, but it seems like she was more interested in having her parents go than even letting our child have this opportunity. ",

One time I caught him snapping photos of me when I was going through a drawer in my kitchen. I told him to not take pictures of me without my knowledge again. He says it\u2019s because \u201cI\u2019m So BeAuTiFuL\u201d but I don\u2019t buy it. Then another time I found him on my phone sending my own selfies to his phone. I was so creeped out. Another time, I found a picture of myself and him on his FB stories. In the picture I am completely unaware that he was taking a photo of us. It\u2019s creepy. The last straw was when I was sitting at his dining room table, he snapped a photo of me, thinking I wasn\u2019t paying attention. I got SO mad and flipped out and called him a creep and a loser. I told him I lost all respect and trust in him and that we are no longer friends.  Did I overreact? I don\u2019t think I did. Why would a guy friend do that? Has anybody here had similar experiences?

        "selftext": "Recently my father and I got into a huge political disagreement. We've always disagreed about some topics but over the years he's gotten worse. I (20 F) and my dad (45 M) have always talked about changes in the country or things that scare us. We used to be able to have a normal Ish conversation about these topics which include women's health or gay rights, but he's gotten increasingly more hostile about the conversation topics. A few months ago, I stopped talking to him for a few weeks because of it. It was really hard for me because the conversation ended with him saying cruel things to me. Such as... you need a man to get preg. Can't elaborate more but I'm sure you get what he said. For more context, I'm gay and engaged to a woman. We've been engaged for about 6 months now and were planning on wait till she was finished with school. Now we're both scared with the current circumstances that we won't have that chance. Though nothing is for certain of course, nothing is impossible. With the recent TikTok ban, which everyone has entitled opinions about, I tried to have a conversation with my dad about this and he turned into a screaming a-hole. It was an hour-long conversation which I did my best to be respectful, but he started to make comments about my age claiming that my opinions didn't matter because of that. Anytime I tried to speak he cut me off to yell at me. I can't go to in depth with our political beliefs because it is against guidelines, but he is red, and I am neither or. I can't agree with much of anything on the red or blue side because of my beliefs and things I've done for my own personal research.  After about an hour of him yelling and screaming at me, I finally put my foot down and told him, If you continue to yell at me, I will hang up this call and we can go a few months without speaking. This is my boundary, and you need to respect it. I never want to talk about these things with you because we obviously can't come to a mutual agreement- he cut me off to continue screaming at me and calling me a child.  I hung up and blocked him on everything. I felt so guilty for it. Now my fianc\u00e9 and I have our wedding planned in March. It's been a couple weeks since my father and I have spoken but he wanted to be there and make the rings for us as well. I feel extremely conflicted because my mom is performing the ceremony for us. She has her opinion about the situation and seems to think it's a good idea if he's not there. I've made jokes about it in passing but it's making me feel so sick to my stomach. This is my first wedding and the first relationship that has been healthy for me. Both of my parents love her, and I wanted to have everyone there. Now I don't know what to do. I'm scared my mom's side of the family will disagree with me and say that I'm wrong for inviting him, but I'm scared that I will feel guilty for the rest of my life for not trying to fix things with him so he can be there.

My roommate (M 34) is having a stressful week at work and works most days from our apartment. On Monday and Tuesday, I went to the gym to work out with my friend who\u2019s a personal trainer and training me for free on his time. So, I left at 4:30 and came back at 6:30 and my roommate said he cannot handle dog watching while I\u2019m away and he\u2019s working. This is the calmest and least needy dog I\u2019ve ever met and he\u2019s a 10 years old yorkipoo. He just sleeps and occasionally barks when he hears our neighbors coming and going. My roommate said that he can\u2019t mentally separate having a dog hanging out at home or if I had brought home a guest and then left him alone to entertain my friend. I just needed 2 hours away to workout. My roommate was at the office most of the day Monday and Tuesday and then came home and had more work to do. He came home just as I was leaving for the gym at 4:30 and I came home and was lectured more about how I didn\u2019t listen to him and left him alone to dog sit again. I don\u2019t see how this is dog sitting; he doesn\u2019t have to walk, feed, or even interact with the dog. So, am I the asshole for not understanding where he\u2019s coming from and still trying to go to the gym for my 2 hours?  EDIT for more info: I did inform my roommate that I would be taking care of the dog for a month and he said that was totally fine. I\u2019ve also spent multiple days away with the dog at my boyfriend\u2019s place to give my roommate more space when he\u2019s working from home. This week, he\u2019s working at the office most days til 4 and I leave for the gym at 4:30. I plan on spending the rest of the week at my boyfriend\u2019s place since I know this week is a lot for my roommate. But that\u2019s also a big inconvenience for me and adds an additional 25 to 40 minutes to any commute I have to make which is usually only 5 to 10 mins. I also have to go grocery shopping so I have food at my boyfriend\u2019s place and pack enough clothes for the week. Doing all that so he doesn\u2019t have to spend 2 hours alone with the dog just seems like a lot. ",

She expected me to still give her my ticket, even though she wasn\u2019t sure if she could even use it (it required a student ID, and she was in high school). At that point, I had already made up my mind, so I went. At the ball, I realized my friends had lied about not being there yet and ignored me all night. The next day, a friend texted me saying they thought it was unfair of me to back out of my promise. I explained what happened, but they said I never really tried to be part of the group. *(tbh i never felt like I was, thats why I wanted to go to the ball so desperatly to not miss another group activity since, i didnt take part in them the last few months for personal reasons).* I ended up leaving the group chat because I didn\u2019t feel welcome.

        "selftext": "So I am the youngest of 3 siblings My sister who is the oldest finally moved out last summer. For 2 years before she actually moved out the whole family were trying to encourage her to move out and go to university to study psychology which had been her dream for a long time. But at first she decided to just take a year and go work to save up some money. After that she went and actually tried to get into a university but she didn't get in but that turned out to be a lie. She just didn't take the spot because she was scared to live alone. But finally she applied to a school this time to study engineering and got in and moved out. After that she started visiting home every other week, staying the weekends, whole weeks etc. The thing is she has to sleep in my room during those times (we used to share a room also before she moved). So at some point it started getting pretty frustrating because I wanted some peace but couldn't because I always had to prep the room for her (I had to move heavy furniture so she would have a spot) and then last time she visited she got mad at me for not moving the furniture (I had hurt my back badly so I couldn't) and also for not getting her a towel or a pillow/blanket. She even went and complained to our mom about it. She complained about me the whole time she was visiting to everyone including my brother's gf who she isn't even close with. So the day she left I told her that I don't want her to visit anymore because of her behavior and also because I honestly just am frustrated at her for always coming to stay over. My mom got mad at me for this but my dad told me that how I reacted was valid bc of her behavior.So AITA? ",

She ran away when she was 14, and has been couch surfing/staying with her mom (who I don\u2019t know much about)/living at a group home since then. She didn\u2019t see her dad much at all in that time, maybe once a month for a few minutes so he could give her money. Past that she refused to see him entirely. For the last few weeks she\u2019s started coming to our house almost every day.  I don\u2019t mind her coming over, I would hope that her and her dad would have a good relationship and see each other. This issue is we all smoke weed. The daughter smokes weed as well, and I have conflicting opinions on that, I was a huge stoner (among many other things) as a teenager and know that telling a teen that\u2019s already into that kind of thing what to do doesn\u2019t work. It didn\u2019t work on me and I\u2019m sure it wouldn\u2019t work on the daughter. She\u2019s gonna do what she\u2019s gonna do and I\u2019m not her parent so I\u2019m not one to tell her what to do anyway. But roommate will actively get high with his underage daughter (and her friends!!) in our house, and it makes me DEEPLY uncomfortable. When she\u2019s here I just keep to my room, because in my opinion it\u2019s incredibly inappropriate to do things like that with a child and I don\u2019t want to be around it. When I try to talk to roommate about it he just laughs it off and won\u2019t engage with the conversation. I don\u2019t know how to get it through his head that it\u2019s not okay to get a kid high (especially ones that aren\u2019t yours!!!). It bothers me even more because I\u2019m on (unsupervised) parole and if anything were to happen and police found out what he was doing that I could be implicated or associated with it and they would take me back to jail.  I might be TA because this is the first time in a long time his daughter has been willing to spend any time with him, and I\u2019d hate to get in the way of them having a friendly relationship (and I firmly believe he is not capable of having a parental relationship with her, mostly because of who he is as a person but also because I don\u2019t think she would allow for it and would disappear again) She has asked why I don\u2019t hang out with them when she\u2019s over (I\u2019m the only woman in the house and I can tell she wants me to like her, and I do! I just cannot be around that) I\u2019ve made excuses about not feeling good, etc. because I don\u2019t want to badmouth her dad to her but I\u2019m 3 seconds away from saying \u201cbecause I respect you enough as a person and a child to not behave like that around you, and because there\u2019s something deeply wrong with adults who will partake with children\u201d the next time she asks. I\u2019m not sure what to do here, I don\u2019t want to be the reason they have no relationship, she\u2019s not my kid so I have no say over what she does (and neither do her actual parents it seems), but this puts me at risk and when I tell the roommate that he does not listen.

        "selftext": "PSA: English isn\u2019t my first language, so please be kind. I (26F) have been married to my husband (32M) for almost a year now, and we\u2019ve been together for five years. We come from different countries and cultures. We met in 2020 in my hometown while he was there for work and got stuck due to COVID. At the time, I was doing my MBA. By the time I graduated and started job hunting, it was time for him to go back. He wasn\u2019t sure when or if he\u2019d return, and neither of us wanted to do long distance, so we decided I wouldn\u2019t take a job and would go with him instead. I started working in his business and received a salary. We traveled a lot for work and were together 24/7. In 2022, he and his business partners sold that business and made good money. My husband already owned some property, and after selling the business, he bought more and made various investments. He works a lot\u2014he\u2019s a professor, a business owner, a trader, and much more. Over time, I started helping him with almost everything. I didn\u2019t get a salary, but he always told me, \u201cMy money is your money,\u201d and I never had to ask for anything. I always had more than enough, and he even helps my family. Still, it sometimes bothered me that I didn\u2019t personally own anything. In 2023, we got engaged, and in the summer of 2024, we got married. That same year, he bought another business with his friend and my FIL (75M) as partners. The business needed a lot of setup and administration work, but my husband was too busy to handle it. His friend works full-time, so he couldn\u2019t help much, and his father is a silent partner. Naturally, all the work fell on me. For the past 10 months, I\u2019ve been working on this business 24/7 hiring people, managing marketing, setting everything up, solving endless problems, and doing a million other things. I don\u2019t mind not owning anything in the business, we\u2019re married, and what\u2019s his is mine but what does bother me is how my FIL treats me. During meetings, when I present ideas and get everyone up to speed, my husband always acknowledges my work, saying things like, \u201cThanks to OP, we\u2019re able to run this business.\u201d But my FIL constantly downplays my role, acting as if I\u2019m just an employee. He even tries to take credit, saying buying the business was his idea. Last week, he did the same thing. Downplaying  my role and even telling me to take notes, as if I were some intern and not the person leading the meeting. That\u2019s when I started thinking: if my husband expects me to keep working on this business, maybe I should ask for some shares in it. I brought this up to my mom, and she lost it on me. She said, \u201cHe\u2019s your husband, why would you ask him for that? You shouldn\u2019t pay attention to your FIL. What\u2019s his is yours, and you should be thankful because he\u2019s so kind.\u201d In my culture, men are put on a pedestal even when they don\u2019t deserve it, and my husband is amazing, so of course, my mom is biased. I don\u2019t really have friends I can talk to about this, so, internet strangers AITA for asking for shares in his business?",

        "selftext": "AITA for not summarizing TV shows for my husband? [Update in comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/qm07zWV2xg) Ongoing argument between my husband and me. I'll be watching a show, and he'll come in partway through and watch a few minutes. He might watch bits and pieces as he comes and goes. Since he knows a little about what's happening, when he comes back he'll ask, So what happened with the suspect? Why did they break up? It's not always a one sentence answer, and it takes me out of watching the show to have to summarize what happened. And I know it sounds silly, but if I'm watching a show to relax, I don't want to have to sit and think about how to explain what happened.  Our most recent argument was when I was watching Will Trent and he had asked me 3-4 questions already that I answered. Finally he asked me another, and I told him, exasperated, to just look online. (Something I've started saying to him when I don't want to answer.) He argued that it would just take a few seconds to answer the question. I told him any reasonable person would agree with me, so here we are. Btw, this is not a serious fight. I am exasperated with him, but neither of us are seriously upset and we love each other very much. Even if I do want to throw a pillow at him when he does stuff like this.  So what says reddit? Edited to give my husband's perspective: I was in the middle of watching the episode, and fell asleep. When I woke up, the episode was over. I asked my wife how it ended and she refused to tell me.",

        "selftext": "Me (18M) and my friend (25M) are moving to a cheaper place next week and plan to stay there for three more years until we graduate from university. We live in a very small town- about 5000 inhabitants- that has a LOT of stray dogs, people unfortunately take them to the campus\u2019s farm and abandon them as puppies. Recently two more pups were found in campus, so we talked about it and adopting one of them didn\u2019t seem like a bad idea, our new house has a fairly big garden space and one small dog is easy enough to take around if after graduating we decide to move into a bigger city. Well\u2026 turns out this other girl, let\u2019s call her Jane, has been posting around photos of the abandoned puppies and making go funds me to take them to a vet and castrate them, and we told her that we\u2019d be taking one of them home, for her not to worry. It was fine for a day, until I received a message from Jane saying she took both of them to her house (she has 7 stray dogs that are sick and decided to take in two puppies) until we moved to the new house. I found it weird, because well\u2026 why was she doing that? But I decided to donate a hundred bucks for her to get some dog food and keep them until next week. I made it very clear which one of them we would take and that we preferred to take her to the vet ourselves.Some time passed and she just texted my friend \u201chey, would you be upset if I donated both of the puppies to my friend? I don\u2019t want to separate them since they\u2019re siblings\u201d and tried to guilt trip him into either adopting both or none. For context: he\u2019s autistic and cares a lot about animals, so when she did that he agreed to take in both.Fast forward to today, I just discovered all of that, that we would be taking both, and also that she got 500 bucks in debt with the local vet because she decided to take both of them and said WE would pay for both consults, meds and surgeries. I got very upset that we\u2019re now in debt with the vet, for two dogs we haven\u2019t even adopted yet for a bunch of stuff they didn\u2019t even need in the first place and that I wasn\u2019t aware of. I messaged her to try and understand what was she doing, she cursed a lot and basically told me to never direct a word at her again.I don\u2019t want anything to do with this situation anymore and my friend also agrees this is out of hand. I feel really bad that we told her we\u2019d take a dog and she spent a lot of money and time and effort, but I never asked her help in any way, she just jumped in as an adoption manager and invented a bunch of problems as if she was elected responsible for all the abandoned dogs in the city.  AITA for not wanting anything to do with this anymore and giving up on adopting one of them? ",

She never thought to make me sign a lease.  the house isnt big but theres 2 bedrooms. a few months ago I was asked if I would be okay with a new roomate. it was getting cold out meaning gas bills would go up, so I thought it would be great to have help.   I never saw this roomate after he moved in. a month later when I started noticing things like dirty shoeprints, unclean toilet, and garbage being left around the house. I was frustrated because whenever I knocked on his door to hopefully talk suddenly his tv would turn up and id get no answer. I always only ever knocked once and never pestered. I told Shelly about this and asked if she could talk to him for me. she told me she would however things took a direction that I didn't expect.  fast forward to last month. it was a Saturday and I was going to sit down and have some drinks awhile watching tv to reward myself for a promotion I got. I stayed up late watching movies when I hear my roomate go past my door towards the front at almost 4am. I also only realized in that moment it was nearly 4am so I turned my tv off to go to bed not thinking much of it. thats when i got a knock on my door.  I said hello? and heard Shelly. she asked me how I was and I told her I was drunk and about to go to bed hinting I didnt really wanna talk. she then opened my door.  I was taken aback but too dazed to really process what just happened. she then tells me that she talked to him and that shes come to the decision that she wants to evict me. I was startled since I don't have anyone to fall back on and the housing market is evil. if i cant find a house ill be on the streets. I asked why shes doing this and she tells me that during her talk he told her I was creepy and stalkerish but she didnt go into detail about what that even meant. she told me to be out of the house by 30 days then left. I couldn't go back to bed after that. I was too busy trying to find a new place to live because I didnt want to spend energy fighting in court unless necessary. thankfully about 5 days before i was expected to be gone I found a new house to rent. but if i were to pay my last months of rent I wouldn't be able to afford the damage deposit which needed to be paid before i was allowed to move in. I decided that, because of how she evicted me for no reason and there was no lease that I wasn't going to pay.  Its been only a week and shes gone out of her way to leave at least 3 hand written letters at my new place still damanding rent. when I talked to a few different friends about this ive gotten different responses. because of these mixed messages and some guilt im feeling for someone I knew since we were kids, im writing this post now.

The other day, several roommates were in the kitchen making dinner or finding food, and one had just entered the kitchen holding her iPad, watching a lecture video or something.  I was about to pull a hot tray of food from the oven, so I loudly announced I was opening the oven and for everyone to watch out.  The roommate next to me stepped out of the way, so I know there was plenty of time to react, but the roommate holding her iPad did not move.  I backed into her when I stepped back to open the oven door, and she dropped her iPad on the ground.  She did not have a case or screen protector on her iPad, and when she picked it up, the screen was cracked in a few places, but the iPad still worked fine.  She immediately got mad at me for causing her to drop her iPad.  I apologized, told her it was an accident, and asked if she heard me when I said I was opening the oven.  She said she did, but I should have made sure there wasn\u2019t anyone in the way before I moved.  She then demanded I replace her iPad because it was my fault.  I told her it wasn\u2019t my fault, she should have watched out when I said to.  She also didn\u2019t have a case or screen protector, which was irresponsible, and only the screen was broken, so there was no need to replace the entire iPad.  I told her I would help with the cost of replacing the screen, but she insisted she needed a new one and it was my responsibility to pay for it.

I\u2019m living with very bad depression right now and love that I have a cat to hold at night when I feel sad.  I also want to point out that my step dad and my mom sleep with two other cats in that room. Known as Gary and kimchi, the other one we have mostly keeps to himself and another who does love and will actually come if I call her but she\u2019s got her own issues, she\u2019s very old and has little control of her bladder and is very stubborn about using the litter box meaning when I wake up in the next morning our room is reeking of cat piss and peachy is the only cat who\u2019s actually been affectionate toward me. I want to keep her in my room but my mom is telling me to kick her out. I just don\u2019t know what to do because I did try kicking her out but she meowed at my door for an hour on end until I got feed up and let her back inside. I\u2019m trapped in a box now and need advice",

        "selftext": "Recently, after my family watched Squid Game S2 E3, we had a big argument over the usage of my tablet, the one I got from my old trade school I left about a month prior. He claimed that I shouldn\u2019t take it to school, since it\u2019s not necessary. But, I PAYED for it with MY money, getting rid of the school fees. Therefore, it is MY tablet, not his. As such, it is my choice to bring it to school. After saying this, he demanded i give him the IP so he could TAKE IT OFF THE WIFI, which I did not allow. Eventually, my MOM had enough once he started slamming it on the table. She told him to stop, that that tablet was expensive (the usage fee was $500!) and that he e take it off the WIFI, she wouldn\u2019t allow him to do that. This all started because he said he unplugged it last night to plug in one of my brother\u2019s phones, and left it unplugged. But I insisted that he must have done it earlier, because the battery showed it had been plugged in after I got home from school at 3, and was NOT CHARGING 30-ish minutes later, so SOMEONE MUST HAVE TAKEN IT OFF THE CHARGER. I didn\u2019t see who because I had work that night, and I left the tablet there because I usually take it to use on my break, but I wasn\u2019t getting one that day, and it needed to charge. Flash back to the argument, I\u2019m trying ti show him the charge data, but he won\u2019t even let me touch the tablet, demanding I give him the IP, my mom telling him to stop. Eventually, my mom took it from him and placed it on the counter and plugged it in, and told him not to touch it, since it was mine and not his to take control of. (Paraphrased, i don\u2019t remember the entire conversation)  His POV: Im always on a \u201cscreen\u201d (yes, thats how he refers to them) and when im not on one, I \u201cSit on my ass all day\u201d That time im on my ass? School, work and just relaxing at home. I use my phone a lot, yes, but thats because a) im a teenager. b) im fed up with his thinking just because hes the adult, hes always right, and any other viewpoint is \u201cwrong\u201d so i go on reddit to escape. c) i just don\u2019t vibe with things like sports or nature, but LOVE video games.  I dont SEE a reason to go outside if nothing outside interests me. Keep in mind, hes my STEPdad. His three daughters went with his ex, and they used to visit often, but now they rarely show, if at all. He seems very disgruntled about it, and he drinks a good amount, to the point he just watched my brothers\u2019 band and orchestra performances on the school streaming channel, cuz he\u2019s probably too drunk to drive safely there and back.

        "selftext": "I (18f) moved away from my family in 2023 for studies. I\u2019ll be finished this year, and afterwards I am planing to stay here for studies. The place i am renting is only for duration of my studies. My cousin (f18) studies in a different place but wants to move here after studies. And my other cousin (m16) as well. So, this brought up the idea from my family. That two of my cousins can all move together to one apartment. I refused for a couple of reasons.  1. My cousin (f18) is involved with a lot of boys despite her parents being against it. In one occasion she sneaked out with her bf (now ex) during an important family function. The whole extended family somehow blamed me for it, even though i tried to stop her from doing it and even defending her. She also threw me under the bus, so even after years they still bring it up and blame me. Also i got scolded right there and then. This really changed how i see my family, and thats also one of the reasons i moved so far away even though i had the choice to not.  2. She again used my name to get out of meeting up with another bf. She wasnt caught but i felt really betrayed. In case they get caught i have no doubt that i will be blamed.  3. The family plays favorites with her. I have no problem with this, as my mom and dad loves me a lot but in some occasions it makes me sad. I struggle with mental health already and i think that it will make it worse.  I know that this is objectively a good, great idea even. Its a lot better to share rent and live with people who i already know. We are still close despite what happened, but living with someone i know is way better than a stranger.  But i am putting all that aside just for my mental health and its selfish of me. My mom and her mom and dad are both really adamant on this decision, and called me ridiculous for not wanting to do it. My mom called me and said that its because i hate her, but i really dont. My dad also doesnt want me to move in with her, because he knows that how much that affected me.  ",

        "selftext": "I (19 Female) have been living with three girls in a decent-sized apartment for the last 5 months, at first, all was going well, however, after about 2 months, I noticed that my stuff wasn't getting taken care of. For context, I lived with one of my roommates during my freshman year of college, and the other two were random, I provided almost everything for this kitchen and had to purchase quite a few things since this is my first time living in an apartment. I made it very clear that everyone was able to use the stuff that I bought but I wanted it to be taken care of (I was also the only one to provide anything for the kitchen so the roommates have been relying on me for everything). Very quickly my plates, bowls and pots and pans began to pile up in the sink and wouldn't be washed for days at a time (I recently had to throw one of my pans away because it hadn't been washed for days and just stayed on the stove as cooked eggs hardened onto it; I'm sure I could have gotten it clean but to me it was the principle of that fact that my roommate hadn't washed it and it is still sitting next to our trash can untouched). I often never had plates or bowls to use and would have to wash someone else's dishes just to use the stuff that I bought. I am also the only one that ever cleans the kitchen, and even after spending an hour cleaning it, it would quickly become a mess again. One of my roommates has also question why she can't find plates when they are in the dishwasher or I'm actively using them. She will also keep my plates in her room for days and I won't have anything to eat off of. I am not a very confrontational person so I didn't say anything about the mess but would sometimes make passive aggressive comments about the kitchen. As the problem continues, I decided to remove some of my things from the kitchen, like my nice pots and pans and my plates and bowls. It started with just a plate and a bowl so that I had something to eat off of but today I decided to remove all of the plates and bowls and my nice silverware from the kitchen, my roommates aren't home yet but I'm worried about how this interaction is going to go but I plan on just making my case and tell them to buy their own stuff. I understand that this could seem really rude, especially because I don't know my roommates financial state and they regularly use my stuff, but it would be a different situation if they washed my stuff after using it or helped with cleaning the kitchen but I've been dealing with this for months now so I'm extremely tired of it. I am not trying to take revenge and it we can come to an agreement then I'll put everything back but until the discussion is had, my stuff is staying in my room. **AITA?** ",

        "selftext": "Im quite bad at story telling so kindly ask for clarification if needed. My family is Asian. For context my sibling 37M is married (2nd time) and we usually don't get along well together. Now he wanted to come back and stay with parents for the time being cause his wife needs to rest at her parent's home(its nearby).I vehemently refused his presence cause we need to share a bathroom. He works from home so he locks his room , won't open the room to allow me to use the bathroom. Other bathrooms are there in house but my parents are old and frequently need to use it. While he stays at home he doesn't help out in household chores, throws a fit if someone tries to use the room/clean the room even. Meanwhile I am the one the parents call whenever they have inconveniences , need to pay online bills, take them to hospital and clean up after them. Surprisingly before his wife got pregnant he apparently wasnt able to move in with parents with wife cause he needed to go to office once a week. Suddenly he is able move back in ? Also I must apparently use the bathroom during normal hours cause needing to poop at 6.30 am in morning is not a normal hours. Hence my refusal to let him move back in. AITA for refusing to put up with him and compromising?  Edit: Cannot move out for atleast next month or so cause I spent last 3 years getting a degree. Awaiting the documents and for other paperwork. Till then I cannot legally work anywhere. 2. Parents have incontinence issues hence need for their own bathroom and privacy. 3. My income over the years has been  less than him since I am younger by almost 8 years. Hence I have just started my earnings whereas he has been working for long and is now earning more along with perks provided by company. My field does not provide me with that sort of salary even at highest position and perks will not be given at any point in life.  Edit 2: Parents also offered to rent out another place nearby which is 1 min away from our house. Either i would move there or they can. He refused. In-laws also welcomed him to stay with them and he does not want to go there as well. ",

        "selftext": "So we\u2019re both 17 and have been dating for nearly 7 months now, the only \u2018argument\u2019 we had was when I got hurt he was mad that I didn\u2019t avoid the person that hurt me. I didn\u2019t really think of it cause they hurt me for fun and probably wouldn\u2019t do it again but I understood his point of view and didnt do it again. I was introducing my boyfriend to my grandparents today. Once we got there everything was fine and he was really nice to my grandparents and I could tell they liked him. We were talking for a while when I pulled out my bus card, I had to get it renewed in two months and I was gonna do it next week when I\u2019m at my grandparents so I could just walk to school. But he kept saying I should do it on the last day since I would be in Japan for two weeks anyway. I said that when I get back it will be during the school holidays so I would have to wait till school was back to pick it up, and I use my bus card a lot more during school holidays. He didn\u2019t take no for an answer and kept acting like I had to do it on the last day, he started grunting and kicking up a fuss over it and I said \u201chey don\u2019t worry it\u2019s not that important\u201d and tryed my best to just defuse the situation, not to mention I felt extremely embarrased because he was doing this infront of my grandparents and I\u2019ve never seen him act like this before. I looked at my phone and saw we were late for our bus and I used that as an excuse to get out of there fast. Once we left through the door I tryed to laugh it all off, \u2018haha we got so carried away with that we might miss the bus\u2019 stuff like that. As we left through the front gate (I was infront the whole time cause I had the key) I said \u201cHey let\u2019s talk about this later, you\u2019re getting a bit worked up and it\u2019s just a bus card dont worry about it\u201d he than said \u201cWell I wouldn\u2019t be worried about it if you went such an idiot\u201d. I was caught off guard since he had never insulted me before and it was out of nowhere to me. I just kept walking and he yelled something I couldn\u2019t quite make out cause, well I was trying not to cry and was failing, but it was something like \u2018are you really\u2026!\u2019. I just sat down at the bus stop since it was infront of the gate and he thanked me sat down next to me and grabbed me and I said let go of me twice while pushing him away (I don\u2019t like touching people when they piss me off) and he didn\u2019t so I raised my voice and he finally let go. I didn\u2019t say anything else we just got on the bus on the bus and I went to wave at him as he left but he didn\u2019t turn around to look at me so he didn\u2019t see that. Anyways he message me after saying he was ready to talk to when I was ready, honestly I just wanted a sorry or a reason for his outburst but nothing. I don\u2019t want to reach out cause I don\u2019t want him thinking he can hurt me and we can go right back to normal straight away.",

We met freshman year of college and stayed together both through college and grad school supporting each other in our journey and we are very very happy together and very much in love and living in a beautiful home. My parents as a grad school gift to both my husband and I took us out to a very nice dinner and gave us a surprise gift for a weekend get away. They really went above and beyond and we are beyond appreciative. That being said my MIL (she is a single mom) just pointing that fact out to show there isn\u2019t a FIL in the picture so I don\u2019t get any comments such as, \u201cwhy are you blaming the MIL and not the FIL as well?\u201d My MIL gave just my husband a card with cash and nothing to me. And yes it was made very clear this gift was just for him alone and it wasn\u2019t an assumed card for the couple if that makes sense. According to my husband the verbiage surrounding the card and cash was, \u201cI\u2019m so proud of you son for graduating I know how hard you worked towards your goal of graduating.\u201d I\u2019m very hurt I wasn\u2019t included in the card. It\u2019s not about me getting cash it\u2019s the fact this wasn\u2019t addressed to both of us as husband and wife when we are MARRIED and we literally both just graduated. To me it should automatically be second nature when the person your child has been with since your child was a teenager and who is his wife and DIL and they both achieved this milestone at the same time to include their name together on the card and just address it to the two of them as a married couple. It\u2019s not even like he graduated and got a solo gift from his mother and then I graduated a few months later and she overlooked me. We could at least chalk it up to well she may have forgotten but no in this case we graduated at the same time and so this feels more purposeful like only her son\u2019s hard work matters and is being recognized and not her. At the very least if she wanted to give her son a separate card I dunno I couldn\u2019t get a small bouquet of flowers, a $20 gift card to a local coffee shop, a card with a handwritten note. Something? My parents treated us both equally and like a married unit when we graduated and my MIL was very much aware of that fact.  My question is AITA for stepping back from our relationship and being a little more cold to her now because I\u2019m seeing I\u2019m clearly not as important to her as I thought? I could be the AH for freezing her out without knowing what she did to bother me.",

My grandpa recently passed away, and before he died, he asked to see me one last time. I didn\u2019t go. To outsiders, my grandpa was a self-made multimillionaire, a hard worker who farmed, drove a bus for 59 years, and mowed lawns. He was respected in the community, but behind closed doors, it was a different story. My dad and his siblings were raised in an environment where success was expected, not celebrated. No \u201cI love you,\u201d no hugs, no recognition. My dad spent his life chasing approval that never came, which led to drinking and a failed marriage. By the time I was born, we were already the black sheep of the family. When my parents divorced, my grandpa used his money to make sure I stayed with my dad. For the first decade of my life, he was there for me. I thought he had my best interests at heart. But that changed when I got older. When I was in my early teens, my dad and I had to move. We were going to settle on a trailer, but my grandpa refused\u2014*No one in our family is going to live in a trailer.*\u00a0Instead, he bought a house for us. But that house wasn\u2019t a gift. It was control. For seven years, if we were late on rent, he\u2019d threaten to kick us out. One month, we were struggling, and I told him if we paid rent, we wouldn\u2019t have food or gas for two weeks. His response?\u00a0*\u201cIf you can\u2019t pay me, how am I supposed to eat for the next two weeks?\u201d*\u00a0A multimillionaire, telling two struggling people that our late rent would keep\u00a0*him*\u00a0from eating. And it wasn\u2019t just money. I love animals, especially cats. Every time I got one, it would disappear. Eventually, I found out he would take them while we were gone and\u00a0*\u201cdrop them off in the country.\u201d*\u00a0At least, that\u2019s what he claimed. This only stopped when laws changed. When he came for my cats\u2014ones I had for 10 years\u2014I told him,\u00a0*\u201cThey\u2019re neutered, declawed, and protected by law. If you take them, I\u2019ll file a report.\u201d*\u00a0He never touched them again. Then my dad died. Two years ago, my grandpa brought me to his grave. I tried to hug him. He stepped away. That was when I\u00a0*knew*\u2014the love my dad had spent his whole life chasing was never there. It never would be. Years passed, and then my grandpa was on his deathbed. He asked to see me one last time. And I didn\u2019t go. Maybe I should have. Maybe, despite everything, I owed him that. But after a lifetime of watching my dad break himself trying to earn the love that was never given, after years of being reminded that everything my grandpa did for us came with a cost, I couldn\u2019t do it. I just\u2026 couldn\u2019t. And now? He\u2019s gone, and I have to live with that decision. I don\u2019t know if I was justified or if I let my resentment get the best of me. I don\u2019t know if I should have swallowed my pride and gone, or if walking away was the only way to break the cycle.",

        "selftext": "So my roomie cooks A LOT and every time we run the dishwasher it's 95% their dishes and maybe 2-3 of mine. They also jam pack it full such that I get very nervous about breaking or scratching their (nice and probably expensive) dishes. It feels like playing dish Jenga every time. I want to note that part of my disability includes motor control and balance so I'm doubly afraid of that happening. Of note, my roommate is extremely organized and has a system for everything including dishes. I don't necessarily understand how they want their things stacked in the cupboard. There are heights involved that make me nervous as it is much harder to maintain balance and coordination when I'm reaching above me or trying to balance on a ladder. I am also just deeply traumatized by the sound of dishes clanging as, if I used to make audible noises I would get abused and I will never be 100% over that. I am not willing to tell this to them beyond this makes me viscerally uncomfortable but bc I only rarely touch them it's okay how it stands. It is minimal discomfort as is but that would be different if I had to get theirs, too. They typically just empty theirs and put the few that are mine on my pantry shelf. I am not exaggerating a bit when I say that it is 2 or 3 dishes. I mean 2 or 3. I only own one plate, two usable cups, two bowls, and two tupperware. I cannot recall a single time I washed all at once. Again, two or three things and I don't care how or even if they're put up. This time, I actually had like 5-6 dishes and a bunch of silverware so because it wasn't just a very small amount I decided to take mine out and not burden them with it. Well, I woke up to a text saying that leaving their load of dishes for them to put up themselves was rude and douchey. We agreed to handle our own dishes from now on, which means I will be putting up my 3 dishes. This is a nonproblem to me. Am I the asshole here for not putting theirs up? Why I may be the asshole: They usually put mine up even if it's 2 or 3 pieces. They may have seen me putting theirs up as the same amount of labor and therefore a favor I owe back to them. If this is the case then it would be rude for sure.",

I expressed to him on the phone that I wanted to stay home instead of seeing him because i\u2019ve been backed up with school and work. We both have part time jobs and live 45 minutes away, so sometimes it\u2019s not a fun commute from one place to another.  He began to get very irritated with me because i was ultimately cancelling on him but still seeing my friends the same weekend. When i explained to him that i don\u2019t see these friends very often and it was the day before our event and i couldn\u2019t just cancel the plans he became even more upset towards me. He then hung up and continued to bug me about seeing him. I told him i felt as though he was being very inconsiderate and selfish, he has not talked to me since. I can very clearly see why he would be upset because i\u2019m cancelling our plans but i don\u2019t see why he thinks im being so rude for being tired and or stressed. So, WIBTA if i still attend the event and have my friends stay the night instead of strictly seeing my boyfriend?",

Here are the colors.  Ive wanted a cardigan from steady hands for forever. I can't justify spending 50+ on a cardigan for myself. My husband looses a bet and says send me the site. I send him my Wishlist so he can pick and it's still a surprise. *they have funky little designs. Worms, goblins, birds. Funky little stuff with pockets*So the package gets here and it's two tiktok cardigans.. they're cute.. but I'd never get them for myself.. I'm short and one is long, so it comes to my calves.. no pockets. The other is brown.. I dont own a single brown peice of clothing but the design is cute enough. I thought I acted happy. I was a little disappointed so I'm sure it showed but I tried them both on and said I loved them. It's really not a huge deal to me. But I guess I really hurt him. He said I I'm a bad gift getter and I tried so hard to assure him I liked them, I was just surprised. It didn't work, he wouldn't let me hug him. It's been a huge fight. He said he looked for a long time to find them for me.. aita",

        "selftext": "A little over 3 years ago, and coworker approached me and asked me to preserve some flowers from a funeral in resin. I had been working with resin for awhile, but had never done flowers, and was completely upfront with that information.  She said she understood the risks, wanted me to try anyways, and gave me a $100 deposit for supplies (I needed deep pour resin, molds, and silica gel powder), and said to keep it no matter what, just try my best. And I did. I literally tried everything. I did test flower after test flower, thought I had it, but I failed terribly when I went to do the actual flowers. I sent her a message, and never heard back. Then suddenly, today, I get a message from her, asking for the $100 for the flowers back, she could really use it... well, so did I, 3 years ago, when I spent that money, plus some, on the supplies. I'm actually kind of hurt, as I didn't think she was that kind of person. She did just retire, and is on a limited income. And she saw I just opened an online store for polymer clay. Maybe she thinks I'm doing better than I am? Well, I'm not. I'm operating at a loss, not her problem, but then again, I don't feel like her retirement situation is my problem. I was also out of work twice this year due to medical reasons,  a spinal fusion in my neck and a broken foot, and I've been out of work 2 other times for major surgeries in the last 3 years. I don't think I should be responsible for reimbursing her, especially after all this time. AiTA??",

        "selftext": "This situation took place over like 4 hours. It started at around 10 p, where I [M19] initially saw my girlfriend [F17] and everything was great, hugs, kisses, watching shows, etc. I had brought a small dessert for us to share, but she didn\u2019t like it, and she said she wanted pancakes. I was totally fine with the idea of getting pancakes, so I had agreed, and we went on as normal. Let\u2019s say maybe an hour or so went by, and we\u2019re in bed and she brought up how she was sad that I couldn\u2019t come see her yesterday. I reminded her that I had classes and I had to prioritize that first, and also said that if I had too much homework today, I probably wouldn\u2019t have been able to see her. She got mad at this and then started saying how she always puts aside so much work and that it shouldn\u2019t get in the way of me seeing her and that I could just do it at her house (keep in mind I am the only one who ever sees her or drives to see her). I told her that I understood to a certain extent, because she does pull all nighters to see me, but that the situation is different because all of my supplies are at my house, and then the situation kind of blew over but I could tell she was still mad. (I\u2019ve never not come to see her if I had a lot of homework, as I usually do it early, so the entire situation basically came from a \u201cwhat if\u201d). She was emotionless for the rest of the night, and then she told me she was going to do homework. I was left in the room for like an hour or two as she did her homework, which isn\u2019t something that is uncommon, but something that doesn\u2019t bother me. Then the pancakes came back\u2026 She had been emotionless initially from the small disagreement, but then she started asking for pancakes again. She wasn\u2019t asking like in the same attitude she was when she initially asked, just with her emotionless stare, begging and begging for pancakes. (I haven\u2019t went and got the pancakes by this point because she hadn\u2019t reminded me again until after the disagreement and by that point I kind of lost the urge to). She\u2019s done this before where she will beg for me to buy her things. The entire night she showed me no love, she\u2019d walk past me, she wouldn\u2019t even make eye contact with me, all while she was still asking for pancakes. I went into bed with her and told her that I didn\u2019t feel it was right for her to put me down for prioritizing school earlier and for basically ignoring me the entire time after over it and pancakes. She said that she was just so tired of this so tired of everything and that she was going to go to sleep and turned her back on me. At this point, I got up and told her that I was going to go home (3 am). I felt it was unfair that I wasn\u2019t being heard out and that I was also being ignored over pancakes\u2026 I feel like it may have not been the right thing for me to do, but after I left she stopped sharing her location, turned her read receipts off, and took me off her Instagram story.",

When it\u2019s clear that actually I\u2019m seeking acknowledgement of the pressure the current job puts on me and the kids. I will speak with him again to see how we can work through this.  Honestly I love that he loves his job, and 95% of the time it\u2019s fine for us as a family so I am not a total knob I promise!  Thanks for all your comments***********  So my partner works away 5 nights/days out of 7 leaving me to take on the bulk of the parenting and household duties, along with the usual day job, dog, and I also run my own business. Now, I am used to that, it\u2019s been that way our entire relationship, when he is home he is great and slots in perfectly.  He occasionally goes abroad for work, a few weeks at a time which obviously adds more pressure on to me to cover everything and needing more help from grandparents when I have work or my business etc etc. He is going away again soon, but this time will have two trips in quick succession, meaning I\u2019ll be on my own for a total of 4-5 weeks, I am so done! I am tired, and I miss him. I need him here and I hate this job of his, I really wish he would just quit(sadly not an option.) Now, AITA for wanting an apology from him or at least some form of grovelling haha. I know it\u2019s not in his control but I still feel an apology for putting me through all of this would help. I hold a lot of anger about these trips and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable here so please help! ",

        "selftext": "Here me out first before passing judgment. A few months ago, my grandfather turned 80. My brother and I have been living overseas for several years, and this was the first time in a few years that we were both back in town at the same time. As it coincided with our grandfather's birthday, our mother thought it would be great to have a birthday dinner to include my grandfather's children, grandchildren, and great grandchildren as well as their partners and family members, if any.  Since my uncle (grandfather's son) and his wife are usually the busiest, we let them decide the day and time on the one weekend when my brother and I were both in town. They chose Saturday dinner, which everyone then quickly confirmed through a family group chat. This was one month before the party. As the date had been set, I then planned my own time back in town accordingly. Nine days before my grandfather's party when I was back in town, my mother suddenly says that my uncle just messaged the group chat and changed the time to Saturday lunch because it was winter and cold and lunch time would be better for our grandfather. I told her that I was not free for lunch and that I was sure that my brother couldn't make it too, as he had just called me a few days earlier to make sure that our grandfather's party was indeed Saturday dinner. My mother quickly called my uncle to tell him that my brother and I couldn't make it. My uncle then got very angry and immediately said that he would cancel the dinner. 10 minutes later, he sends a message to the group chat saying that (and I quote) that \u201cDue to everyone having prior arrangement on such an important day for grandpa\u2019s birthday and can\u2019t make it to the event, we have decided to cancel the birthday celebration\u201d.  I quickly decided that I would still want to have dinner with my grandfather and confirmed it privately with everyone else, and everyone was fine with it. I then messaged the group chat the next day saying that I was still going ahead with the dinner and anyone who can make it can come and just let me know. I got radio silence from my uncle and his wife.  But AITA for not changing my plans so that the birthday party could be held at lunch? By the way, I thoroughly enjoyed the party and I assume everyone else did too because we didn't need to deal with my uncle and his wife's presence.",

        "selftext": "I (19F) draw. In 2023 I noticed I make more $ w/ furry art. Once I began learning to draw anthros, I made myself a fursona to help me practice. A year ago my lil bro (16M), who we'll call B wanted to make one too for funsies. I've posted lots of art of his sona on my Instagram since then w/o issue. On my art accounts I use a name that isn't mine irl. I do this for my/B's privacy. I've never mentioned B by name before. He's called brother & my followers are my own friends +strangers.He's told me he doesn't want his friends to see my furry art. He's embarrassed/ashamed of it. I'm comfortable with what I do tho & don't need validation from teens. B lives with my dad 3hrs away, none of our friends overlap, so my followers aren't a sign of mine/B's identity. Only way to find my account is to search for it directly or be following my main (which is private) & finding info about it there. B's friends can't see my account unless he shows them or they're already following it; which means they would know what I draw & are okay with furry art.Yesterday B's bestie saw a post on my art dump Snapchat story (which she joined of her own accord) about how I became a furry artist & today B's been ordering me to delete him from everything. He wants there to be no evidence of him on my Insta account in case his friend goes to snoop. He sent screenshots of posts he wanted edited, including one that wasn't even furry art; just an OC he'd made. I asked him why that one & he just insisted all evidence deleted. I argued that on all images of his sona he's not named (btw I have 3 bros so brother doesn't even directly implicate him). & that on most posts the descriptions just mention how he made critiques/suggestions on what to draw w/o any inclusion of the fact that the OCs are his.He said he told his bestie that he didn't know about the characters, so including him at all would get him in trouble. While arguing, I was still making the edits cause I do respect his privacy even if I think his reasoning is bs.I told him I deleted him but that next time he wants to order me around he has to pay me like everyone else; if he wants to make these demands & be the boss he has to hire me.He said wow, so now you don't even respect if people want to be anonymous for personal reasons?. That pissed me off. I told him that I do respect privacy & I have many people I mention using an alias for that very reason. What I don't appreciate is being ordered to go through a year's worth of posts & edit them because he's insecure & hateful. That up until now I had done all his art for free & I don't appreciate the bossy attitude & lack of respect for /me/. So again, if he wants that power, he can pay me for all future art just like everyone else.He thinks I'm being unreasonable/that I'm wrong for posting about him to begin with (tho he's never complained til now).Edit: I had his consent all long, he just freaked out & got demanding/rude today. tl;dr: bro bossed me around, I told him if he wants that privilege he needs to be a paying client.AITA?",

My wife (we are late 30s) has been going through some mental health issues and is has grown very codependent with me taking care of most everything in the household.  She will not travel for this funeral due to some social anxieties as well as fears and personal convictions about the current American climate and where the funeral will be.  I respect her decision not to travel but still intend to go to my brothers funeral.  I would be gone for 48 hours and set up everything for her and our child to be self sufficient while I am gone. I would never be unavailable in event of emergency. This is not a pleasure trip but one I feel a duty to complete.  She has become angry about my going stating that I have not prepared the family for an emergency like this and that I have not supported her or acknowledged her needs and fears in this when I feel like I have. She feels that I should put our relationship and needs above all else at all times and I am being unreasonable pushing for this trip when it could cause her emotional harm.  I fully realize that I could be the asshole in this situation and should be more worried about the family I have created than the family I came from. I do not want to scare or hurt my wife but this is very important to me and I should clarify that she is physically capable of managing the house while I am gone only scared to do so and very anxious. She has declined me having a member of her family visit or taking her and our child to that member of family and called it \u201cdumping her off\u201d.

My husband does not currently have a steady job but does work about once maybe twice a week we both get Social Security and pay rent 50-50 and are responsible for our own phone bills. We have a four-year-old little girl who is in preschool as well as daycare when we decided I was gonna be at stay mom we sat down and talked about with the rules were going to be. I was going to handle any of the major household cleaning cooking stuff like that and majority of childcare related stuff, he of course, still does help more often. Now that he doesn\u2019t have a job but to get the issue we agreed on this we agreed that people would still be responsible for cleaning up after themselves their own trash stuff like that. I have taught our daughter that she is supposed to put her plate in a sink and sweep and wipe down the table when she is done eating as well as lately she has shown interest in doing things like helping feed our cats or clean their litter box and stuff like that, but the part that is driving me crazy is both my husband and my daughter will open Food rappers and stuff and just throw the rappers on the floor not pick up after themselves. My daughter has ADHD and we\u2019re working right now on her ability to finish incomplete one task at a time but with my husband it\u2019s really frustrating. I go around the house every single day and I collect cereal bowls in places other than the sink and he adds sugar to his cereal bowl so then they\u2019ve been sitting out all day and now it\u2019s crusted with milk and sugar, the other thing that drives me crazy is his side of the bed is literally a trash heap. I plan on having a family meeting with them today once everybody gets home and I\u2019m gonna let them know that going forward when I\u2019m around the house cleaning if I find anything where it doesn\u2019t belong or on the floor and I\u2019ve already asked for it to be picked up once and it\u2019s not.

        "selftext": "AITA: Basically, my best friend got a perfume for Christmas and I happened to mention to my boyfriend how I really liked it, but didn\u2019t need anymore perfume because I just restocked on my old scent for the new year and on top of that my mom got me my old, old scent for Christmas. I was genuinely interested in a new one because can\u2019t stand my old old one because the smell brings me back to memories of an incredibly hard time in my life, and I associate my old one with a past relationship. But I had restocked recently and been gifted so I was dead set on not buying anyone for years tbh.But flash forward and for our 6 month anniversary my boyfriend got me the same perfume as my best-friend. Which i thought was incredibly sweet because he didn\u2019t have to do something so big for a 6 month anniversary but he wanted to, and because he remembered that one time i mentioned how much I liked it. It really was the cherry on top of an amazing weekend and I was really excited about it and our relationship in general.Until, my best friend found out and is actually quite upset. She says she \u2018doesn\u2019t even want hers anymore\u2019 and said I should\u2019ve returned it (my boyfriend opened it for me to it\u2019s not returnable). I completely understand wanting a \u2018signature sent\u2019 (a phenomenon i think like most, my boyf has no clue exists) and would\u2019ve never have gone out of my way to buy it. However, I was gifted it, and it was a really sweet meaningful gift to me. I feel like it\u2019s kind of fucked up to insist I return the gift, not to mention I was having a very hard night (computer broke and missed a v important academic deadline) when the topic arose. I feel like it\u2019s a little understandable to a bit upset, but not to demand I return it and then go silent and passive aggressive, when i\u2019m already having a hard time. I feel like it kinda lends itself to a broader theme lately of her treating me unkind. Am I crazy for feeling that way? Am I the Asshole?",

He recently got his first job, which is part time and just a few hours each week. His dad and I cover all household expenses/food and he has considerable savings as I (and other family members) have always given him money. These savings enabled him to go to on an exotic holiday last year. I often don't ask about his life, or job, as I know he doesn't like to share things and, out of respect for his privacy, I never go in his room. He has friends in another town he regularly visits, and his dad usually drives him to and from the train station. Last week he went to a conference with a friend. He asked me to iron his shirt for him (which I did). After a couple of days I asked him if he'd had a good time. He said 'yes'. I then asked if there'd been food at the conference or stalls ('no' and 'no') and went on to ask if his friend knew anyone there ('I don't remember') or if he'd spoken to anyone there ('I don't remember'). I got upset and told him that if he didn't want to answer he could, at least, be gracious with his non answers and also that I felt there was no give and take in our relationship. My son has told me that as I persisted in asking questions when he clearly didn't want to answer I don't care about him. I think this is unfair. AITA? ",

I've always wanted to do one so I figured this year I could do one with my kids and my husband. Nothing real formal just maybe a cake and a day at Dave and busters or something like that. My husband was so happy he of course told his coworkers about the pregnancy. They congratulated him and offered said they would love to throw me a baby shower. Apparently they started planning right away and requested I make a registry at Amazon. I honestly didn't feel comfortable with that, I am just grateful for anything I get. They planned for it to be at the office which is a funeral home. That part does bother me a little, what really bothers me are his coworkers. My husband often comes home and complains about the way they treat him and his staff. From our experience the office staff at funeral homes never respect the guys working outside. Anyhow I told my husband that I don't feel comfortable going because I don't actually know them. What I do know about them is what he has told me and they don't seem very nice. He rolled his eyes and was like  who cares, it's a chance to get free stuff. I still didn't feel comfortable but I said I'd go with him. My husband then told me he wasn't going to be there and I immediately said I'm not going. I appreciate that he wanted to do something for me but him not being there was a deal breaker. It's been two weeks and he asked about it and I just asked him to thank them for the thought but if rather do something with just my family. He really wants me to go but I really don't want to. So would I be a jerk for not going? ",

I (19m) was at what i wouldve considered my main friend group if you asked me a month ago, I was already pissed off cause one of them stole something from me but I didn\u2019t know who so i looked at the guy who\u2019d asked to borrow it from me which what any person would do i think. Anyway i decided to forget it and just get drunk. Here comes the kicker, i had been invited to a party by some other people and it was relatively early so i thought why not? But we\u2019re a pretty tight group its just us we don\u2019t really go out with other people so i turned my location off for them. I had one drink at their place and then I went on my merry way. Then I got a text today saying i was an asshole this that for leaving them and lying saying i was gonna go home. So i told him that I went for one drink and he shouldn\u2019t be so dramatic because he told me us or them. He wouldnt listen and asked me again so I said you\u2019re not gonna tell me who i can talk to or not i dont give a fuck whether you like them or not I can have my own opinion. I mean they always bully me, destroy my shit or steal my shit and i was sick and tired of being treated that way and I dont like to fight so i just left.

        "selftext": "So a few weeks ago my family had a huge fight. Nothing physical but very verbal and rude. My Dad is trying to start a business I really didn't want to be apart of be abuse of past failed business ventures as well as in my opinion my Dad's poor work ethic as it concerns businesses he starts.  Start of issue: Anyway I went to see a client one day and I did my role like I was supposed to however there was one more thing that was supposed to be on the contract (it wasn't there) but needed to be noted. As well a piece involving a certain amount of money on the contract. That aspect is not my job. My father while not the best with work he knows how to take care of his clients aka making things easy for them. My brother on the other hand is very much, the client can fill that out. Well my father tried to speak with my brother and he was being very rude by just walking away. This is not new behavior he's been like this for years. Things escalated to the point of my father and brother yelling at each other, my mother starting to yell stop, and me coming out my room and yelling stop. In which my brother then tried to verbally attack me and I ended it with me calling him a b*tch.  This definitely wasn't my best moment and moments like this, and some in the past is why I didn't want to work with my family in the first place.  Anyway to my posed question... I apologized an in doing so I pointed out the differences in how my brother was raised versus me. My grandmother had a very big influence in my life. My Mom had cancer when I was 2 so my grandmother was there for a vast majority of my childhood to help out. As well as me being raised with different values than my brother. Either way now my mother and brother are upset with me because of what I stated which mind you has been said to me from my mother, it's been stated by my father, so this is not a family secret. I told him I'm going to just mind my business when they're arguing because the things they argue with him about inadvertently they raised him to have those values. I.e. a relationship with God but as a child pulling him from church on Sundays for games and birthday parties. Or how he speaks to my parents but his friends also spoke that way to their parents and they never redirected him to a different friend group. Certain things like that we were raised completely opposite.  Either way my brother isn't talking to me still and my Mom while she I'd talking to me I feel like it was very corny of my brother to share what I said to him with our parents. Anyway am I the A.H.? More detail, I'm (30F) and my brother is (24M). FYI I wanted to share images of the text messages but couldn't. Sorry guys.",

        "selftext": "I (23afab) went to my mom's (40f) job last week to pick up some paperwork. While I was there my mom told me that my hair was a mess. I have locs and haven't had the time for a retwist so I just told her I'm gonna twist it this week. She then says that I'm only wearing half a shirt. I was wearing a crop top and thought she was making a joke so I laughed it off and left to go finish running errands. Today I called and asked her if I could come in to get some bloodwork done (she is a nurse and I need a TB test for a job application). She told me I could as long as I didn't look a mess like last time. I was confused and asked what was wrong with my outfit to which she replied that it wasn't appropriate for her work. She said that my clothes were inappropriate, my hair was a mess, and it made me look dirty. I acknowledged that my hair wasn't done and then asked what was wrong with my outfit: a crop top and cargo pants. She told me that the look didn't reflect on her as my parent. I told her that I had dressed with her in mind: I wore a bra, no crazy makeup, and even wore the shoes she got me because I know she hates my favorite pair; but it still wasn't good enough for her. She holds me to too high of a standard that I don't ever expect to meet and I'm tired. She responded by saying that she holds all of her children to high standards because that's her job as a parent.  This is when I kinda lost it. My mom had me at 17 and I have never lived with her. I was raised by my great grandparents and although we have a rocky relationship, they have more claim as a parent than she does. I told her that she doesn't have the right to parent me and that anything I do reflect more on my great grandparents than her. This isn't the first time we've had an argument similar to this but for some reason I'm more angry than usual. To say that I look dirty and that it reflects poorly on her as a parent is absolutely wild to me especially given our relationship. ",

Jake loves giving hugs and being otherwise very physically affectionate with all of his friends and I\u2019m not at all comfortable with physical contact due to personal reasons. We\u2019ve tried other solutions like using a hugging emoji instead because he feels like by not being outwardly affectionate he\u2019s not being himself at all. The hugging emoji started being worked into every text all the time and it began to make me increasingly uncomfortable and Jake unfortunately picked up on it. He got really upset with me and said that it\u2019s really unfair to him that I can\u2019t be more affectionate especially since I\u2019ve been really busy with work and other things lately as we haven\u2019t been able to hang out much. I honestly agree I feel like he\u2019s been trying to be someone he\u2019s not to make me comfortable but I don\u2019t know how to make myself more comfortable with either the emoji or physical contact.

I have epilepsy and no medication, i panic and don't think much of the missed bus stop, sometimes it happens, i figure it's no big deal. i figure i'd get another bus back. all i can think of is how much time i have left to get my medication. the bus driver pulled me aside at the next stop, yells at me, and says that i missed the bus stop on purpose, i said i'd pay the difference, but he says he can't do that. i don't know what to say. i said I'm sorry but you were going so fast and i saw my pharmacy was closed, i panicked and was looking for open pharmacies on google.  i figure i'd get another bus into town to get an emergency prescription, lo and behold, same bus driver. he says to me, and i quote, you have some nerve getting onto my bus again. i looked at him and said i said i would pay the difference. he goes you know you can't. i said i'll pay it right now, add it on to my ticket i'm paying for. he sighs, shakes his head, and then calls me a liar and a cheater. it is a 40p difference in ticket by the way. i told him he was being unnecessarily hostile and rude and i left before it turned into a yelling match because he just seemed in the mood to pick fights, i went upstairs.  he proceeds to rant about me to another man who asked what happened so loudly that the entire bus can hear, he calls me a liar and a cheater again. tells the man i swindled him on purpose because i missed my bus stop, and cost the bus company 40p.  am i the asshole? i am genuinely unsure because his reaction was so severe it made me feel like i'd done something wrong.

        "selftext": "For some context, I am still in school and we have the option to order lunch from the cafeteria. One of our close friends sits at our table and gets school lunch every day. He often / almost always gets ketchup with his lunch. I my whole life have been extremely disgusted by ketchup. I honestly couldn\u2019t tell you why, I have no issue with tomato\u2019s, In fact    I love tomatoes. Him having ketchup doesn\u2019t bother me in the slightest, but my other friends who sit at the table like to play jokes on me by smearing ketchup on me and my food. I have always expressed how much this upsets me as my as they like to say \u201cfear\u201d of ketchup isn\u2019t a joke. It genuinely fucks with me and to an extent can make me lose my appetite if it\u2019s smeared on me or my food. On Friday my friend (the one wearing the scuba) decided it would be a fun Idea to play one of these jokes on me. Her and another friend who sit with us often bring fun or ethnic candy / foods to lunch. In her hand, she had a green grape covered in a reddish / pink coating and said \u201cthis grape is really crunchy\u201d she hadn\u2019t played any jokes on me recently and knowing her liking for cool foods, I assumed it was tanghulu (if you don\u2019t know, tanghulu is a fruit in a crunchy sugar coating) another fact is she had the grape in her hand, making me assume the coating was solid. With all this in mind, I took the grape unsuspectingly when I then felt the liquidy feeling on my hands, immediately alerting me that the thing on the grape was in fact ketchup. I was extremely upset by this as I have previously stated they know things like this make me lose my appetite. I have never retaliated towards these jokes before as I always thought they didn\u2019t realize the extent of my distaste. But I was proven wrong when I realized she felt like she had to lie to me to get me to accept anything with ketchup on it. It made me realize she fully knew how much it upset me. In an admittedly immature mix of anger and disgust, I threw the grape at her. It landed in her hair then tumbled onto her scuba. She flipped out to say the least. I got up calmly and walked over to the paper towels to wipe off my hand. While I was up there she came back up to me and smeared ketchup on my white sweater. I still kept calm as I don\u2019t want to continue the immature back and forth that\u2019s going on. I redirect myself to the bathroom where I attempt to wash the stain of my sleeve. She completely thinks I\u2019m the asshole because her scuba was \u201cmore expensive\u201d than my sweater. She even said \u201cMines Lululemon and yours is from where? Old navy?\u201d  (It\u2019s from American eagle and says American eagle in big letters on the front) I truly want feedback and want to know if I\u2019m the asshole in this situation. I would again like to reiterate that my thing with ketchup isn\u2019t a joke and it\u2019s a genuine thing that disgusts me. So, let me know.",

I have a job, I pay my bills, I put in for the rent, and I try my best to be responsible.  I also want to put it out there that I am in a family who uses Life360, as a way of \u201csecurity to make sure we\u2019re doing alright.\u201d But I know damn well that it makes it difficult for me to be free and go places without people knowing.  So I decide to treat myself to a tattoo, because I feel like I deserve it after all the hard work I put in at my job. It makes me happy, and I want it to get through the mental turmoil I am getting from what is going on in the world.  However, I still feel like I need to tell my parents what I am doing. This is something I SHOULDN\u2019T be doing because I am an adult. They don\u2019t need to know if and/or when I am getting a tattoo. If it was me, I\u2019d turn Life360 off. It\u2019s so much that it has become a heavy weight on me that I can\u2019t get off until I tell my parents. And so I did.  I told them straight up that I already made the appointment, placed the deposit, and financed it. I have been met with my mother crying again. With previous tattoos she asks me why I am investing so much. Now she asks me \u201cwhat is going on in your head??\u201d It felt like she was asking \u201cwhat is wrong with you\u201d for wanting my arms covered. She didn\u2019t talk to me for the rest of the day.  My dad then comes and then asks me to \u201creconsider the date and push it further because that way my mother won\u2019t feel bad anymore\u201d This comment triggered me because it comes off that I can\u2019t do something for ME to be stable and happy, but I have to fold for others to make THEM stable and happy. Or that my decisions and choices are too much when already I am doing stuff and even more at my job.  So I am struggling to confidently say that I will proceed with my appointment because there is that lingering guilt of hurting my parents. But I in good faith cannot bend my arm to please others because I am doing that every day. For making that decision and \u201crebelling\u201d against them, AITA?",

I (18f) have known my brother\u2019s (34 m) girlfriend (24f) for about 7 years. Her and her family usually come over to spend the holidays at our house, since my brother and I both live with our parents. For a bit of context, I have a pretty healthy relationship with my brother and we hang out about once a week. Similarly to most little sisters, I tend to tease him and my other older brother every now and then, which is all in good fun. As for my relationship with his girlfriend, it\u2019s pretty neutral since neither of us seem to care much about one another. I respect her as my brother\u2019s lover, but I wouldn\u2019t really consider her a personal friend due to how little we interact outside of family gatherings. This Chinese New Year, I decided to mess with my older brother. Our mother had asked me to text my brother to see when he was coming over, which I decided to get creative with. It was a very short and informal text, essentially teasing him by saying something along the lines of \u201cYou and (other brother) are lazy as hell, OP\u2019s really clutching up for CNY by making all the food while yall just sit on yalls phones,, when ya getting here btw lmao?\u201d and that was it. (Sorry for the informality, I wanted to replicate the message as closely as possible for clarification purposes)  It was a really short text with what I would consider to be regular teasing that I tried to make very obviously a joke and as my texting style, so I didn\u2019t think much of it when I sent it. My brother showed up a bit late to dinner while his girlfriend and her family were nowhere to be found. He explained to me that she went through his phone and saw the text message, got upset, and decided not to come over to dinner with her family last minute. She later called our mom during dinner and was crying over the phone (which I heard, since our mom had her on speakerphone). She was saying something about how she thought I hated her, which our mom had left the table to console her about.  Now my brother is asking me to apologize to her for the message. I\u2019ll do it for sure, since I felt bad hearing her cry and watching our mom leave the table to console her over the phone. However, this request confused me quite a bit since I never once mentioned her in that message I sent, nor did I send it to her in the first place.  For clarification, only my brother\u2019s girlfriend is upset about this. My brothers both laughed it off and assured me neither of them cared, since my brother immediately knew the message was from me and was me joking around.  Anyways, AITA for making my brother\u2019s girlfriend cry by teasing him?",

        "selftext": "Hi. 18M. So, my family is tense right now. My younger half sister (13F) has gotten to the age where she is being quite rebellious. She\u2019s popular at school, and does well socially. The problem is, she\u2019s become an asshole at home. One this about me is that I have OCD and I\u2019m autistic. When it comes to food, I need everything to be clean and can be quite obsessive. I wash my hands frequently, and must ensure that cutlery and dishes are spotless before I use them. I make all my own meals because I don\u2019t like people touching my food. Okay- now onto the main bit. My sister has recently started doing incredibly disgusting things in the kitchen. Some examples:- Scooping out Nutella with her bare hands- Putting DIRTY cutlery BACK in the cutler drawer on the clean stuff- Putting used and dirty dishes on the clean stuff- Putting dirty cutlery in the clean dishwasher This hasn\u2019t happened once or twice. I\u2019d say this has happened over 20 times in the last six months and it\u2019s really upsetting me. I was always the black sheep of the family, and bullied quite a lot. If I bring up stuff like this I get called mean names. Today was a bit of a breaking point for me. I woke up, and went to empty the dishwasher. In the clean cutlery section, there was a dirty knife put on the clean ones. On top of that, there was a used cereal bowl put at the top, so all the excess milk spilt out on the clean ones. This really, upset me. I\u2019ve tried telling my mom to be stricter, and less relaxed about this stuff, but every time I do I get told I\u2019m being an asshole because my sister is \u2018still learning\u2019 or something like that, and that she \u2018has hormones\u2019 and that causes her to be more difficult.  I get it. I get that she\u2019s at an age where she\u2019s probably most rebellious and least thoughtful, but this stuff genuinely really upsets me. 2024 I experienced severe stomach problems due to stress, anxiety, and the fear of throwing up, and through therapy I\u2019m trying to do more behaviour experiments to help OCD- but stuff like this just validates my fears. I\u2019m trying so hard to move out. Am I being an asshole? Am I being to harsh? It feels like my sister is treated as the favourite. I have an older brother (25M) who moved out a few years ago, and me and him had a lot stricter rules. Imo the stuff she\u2019s doing is disgusting and unacceptable. I get she\u2019s only 13 but at that age I would have never even fathomed doing stuff like that- because it\u2019s not only gross but puts other people at risk. I feel really upset.  If this happened once or twice I\u2019d be more understanding, but this genuinely happens so frequently it\u2019s insane. Also, she\u2019s just as unthoughtful in other places- so many times I\u2019ve gone to take a shower to find it covered in hair product and hair. I\u2019m trying to be patient and understanding but I can\u2019t.",

        "selftext": "Hi, so today I (16F) was working on some English homework in my room when my mom (46F) came in. For some context, my family is Muslim, and my mother is extremely religious to a point the rest of us are not. Regardless, I still complete the five daily prayers every day to avoid her getting mad at me, because if I stop, it could result in her pulling me out of school and trying to marry me off, as she's threatened to do. My mom is known among my sister, my father, and I to be narcissistic and emotionally immature, but she refuses to get help or accept that she has a problem. We just put up with her behavior all the time, but sometimes I snap a bit. My mom was telling me that I need to complete the night prayers right after we eat dinner so she can watch me pray and see that I'm actually doing it. I responded that I do pray but I do it before I go to sleep because I'm usually right in the middle of something before dinner and want to finish it up. She began saying that she doesn't hear me get out of bed to pray at night and she doesn't believe that I actually do it. I told her I'm not sure why she doesn't hear me because I do get up and pray, but she kept accusing me of lying. I was in the middle of trying to finish this assignment and I was frustrated that she was making it *my* problem that *she* can't hear me. I asked her if she wants me to be louder or something and she said No, I just want you to tell me why I can't hear you, and I want you to actually pray. I got fed up and here's where I may be TA. I told her (politely but firmly) that I was done with this conversation because it wasn't going anywhere and asked if she could leave me alone so I could work. She kept nagging me to answer her question and told me I can't ask her to leave whenever I feel like it, and I responded by telling her that I already answered her question and she was distracting me and there was no point in continuing the conversation when she wasn't listening to me. I then reminded her that she does this all the time, comes in my room and starts accusing me of things and doesn't listen to my side of the argument, & why should we have more conversations like this when we already know how it's going to go? She tearfully told me that if I don't want her in my room she'll leave, and I politely responded, Oh, okay, you can leave then. She yelled, You don't want me in your room? Fine, write it down then. This is the last time I'm ever stepping foot in your room. She proceeded to slam the door extremely hard and hasn't spoken to me since. It's true that I was annoyed with my mom for accusing me of lying and repeating the same things over and over again. I feel like her slamming the door so hard and having that reaction to a pretty reasonable request was a bit of an overreaction, but I'm worried asking her to leave me alone was too harsh. However, I didn't say anything in a rude or yelling tone, I tried my best to maintain my composure and say everything calmly. AITA? ",

Over the holidays he emotionally cheated on his fianc\u00e9e (did sexual stuff online with a stranger) and she understandably broke up with her and ended their engagement over this past New Year's. After the breakup, my sister met up with him as a friend to hear about the breakup and hang out, but I guess once they did that, he suddenly started to develop feelings for my sister and now they're basically dating but not officially yet.  She told me that he struggles with his mental health and he's seeing a therapist and on medication now, and she told me that he SAID he wanted to take 3-4 months off dating but now over only a few hangouts, him and my sister are basically together now which I feel like is SO fast and this man really moved quickly. I want to be happy for my sister because she is finally with the guy she likes a lot, but it feels icky how fast this all happened, especially because he was the cheater in the last relationship.. My cousin is getting married March 15 and now she wants to bring this new guy to the wedding. \ud83d\ude43 The wedding is here in FL where I live and my sister lives in Virginia, and usually when she visits I let her stay in the guest room and in my condo with my husband and I. But now that she is insisting on bringing him to the wedding, regardless of whether my cousin can accommodate him or not at the actual wedding, he is still coming with her to visit my whole family for the first time. I feel like all of this is happening way too fast, maybe it's just me because I have a hard time with change, but am I an asshole if I don't feel comfortable letting her and her extremely new boyfriend stay at my place?

        "selftext": "My sister wants to build a startup and has continued to ask me for help due to the professional skills I have that would aid her in getting the business off the ground. I have done side projects with her in the past, which had largely consisted of me attempting to teach her my skill set. I can get short when teaching others, if I get the impression that they are not truly putting in a genuine amount of time and effort to learn what I\u2019m teaching. I experienced this with her when she was not meeting up regularly to do work on the project and then requesting that I bring her up to speed when it was convenient to her. These projects all ended the same way, the working relationship broke down and then I finished out the project on my own. My sister has asked once again for my aid, this time not just a project but to get a full company up and running. I had initially refused stating that we are just not compatible business partners. This was met with an angry response and many personal attacks that placed blame on me for the break down of the past projects. Fast forward a little more and she has moved past my initial rejection and is attempting to ask for help again. I have at this point said I\u2019m not interested in the work or undertaking the risk associated with joining a startup. This was met with the ultimatum of \u201cif you refuse there\u2019s no second chance, if I make it don\u2019t come crawling to me asking to get in on the success\u201c. To which I replied that I understood and need more time to think, knowing that an outright refusal would result in another heated argument. The root of the \u201cAITAH\u201d is that any time I refuse, there\u2019s a clear emotional reaction. I would expect someone to approach recruiting anyone, family or otherwise, with a professional and courteous demeanor. But that\u2019s not what I\u2019m experiencing. Perhaps I\u2019m being emotional? Perhaps me saying I need to think rather than outright refusing for a final time is me being an asshole? There\u2019s probably a lot of missing context here so please feel free to ask questions.",

They had already booked to go together before I even agreed to go, and were happy to split the cost between the two of them. They then asked if I would want to go (this MORNING) and I said yes at the time because I didn't really think it through and it was a spontaneous decision. They called me tonight and we booked train tickets, and the hotel is payable when we arrive but we said we would just split the cost after. They talked about what they plan on doing whilst there and it's a big weekend of clubbing and drinking and after thinking about it I've decided that I just really don't want to go- I'm not in the position to be spending lots of money and partying just isn't my scene anymore. I've cancelled on the last few weekends out too because I haven't wanted to party hard and they just don't understand and have got really angry at me for being flakey and now saying they're left with having to pay for the hotel. Should I just suck it up and go given that I'm young and should just enjoy myself- or go with my instinct and have the weekend in like I enjoy?   To clarify: They were going regardless. They decided and booked the hotel BEFORE i was involved. they asked me, i said yes which was a rushed decision. On our call- they said they wanted to party really hard and i dont. that made me rethink- and since i've been stressed about that and money. The train tickets have nothing to do with me dropping out, they have their own tickets and like i said..they were going in the first place as just the 2 of them!",

I have told him before that I don\u2019t want to cut his hair, I have done it before and it\u2019s never something he ends up liking. Since the last time I cut it I told him, I am not going to cut your hair to avoid any issues. It\u2019s been months since his last hair cut, I have told him before to go look for someone professional to cut his hair, he refuses to look and drive far to get a hair cut. All the other times I have had to find a place for him to get his hair cut and sometimes the people that cut his hair he doesn\u2019t want to go back to either because of bad service or he ended up getting cut (ex. The back of his neck nipped) and I understand some reasons but I have told him to look for someone he would like to go see if he should check it out. Well last time I cut it, it was to long it wasn\u2019t what he wanted, this time it was to short. I am not a professional, this isn\u2019t a hobby I want to do this isn\u2019t something. I don\u2019t know how to cut hair and I really didn\u2019t want to do it the reason I did it this time was because we are low on money and can\u2019t pay anyone to cut his hair we barely have enough for food atm, I have also told him that he should cut his hair so I don\u2019t have but he hasn\u2019t tried. So I want to know AITAP.S. I didn\u2019t mean to cut his hair to short he claims I did it on purpose. When I told him I was trying to get it even.Edit; I take back that he hasn\u2019t cut his hair, he did it once and messed up bad, he was frustrated that I was to slow (first time cutting his hair) and he got the clippers and started to cut his own hair, safety guard fell off in the process and from then on hasn\u2019t tried to cut his hair because he had to go bald that time and still got upset with me for being to slow.",

For extra context, I\u2019m autistic. I need structure and I like having things sorted way ahead of time. My partner is not, he just tends to \u2018go with the flow\u2019. Going on vacation together has always been a goal of ours. We were both absolutely certain we wanted to go on vacation in summer 2025. I brought up that we should get looking ASAP if we wanted a better variety of places to choose from within our budget. We both agree.  Throughout January, I\u2019m sending him links, sites, deals - all of which meets our \u2018list\u2019 of what we\u2019re looking for. He says yes to every one of them which I found odd. Surely you\u2019d have some preference, right? I assume he\u2019s eager to go and genuinely likes them all. Bare in mind we are both paying 50/50.  By the end of January, we still haven\u2019t booked because he keeps leaving things until last minute like telling his boss he\u2019ll need time off.I call him out on this as I\u2019m getting a little anxious, majority of the places we liked were now at capacity so those were off the table. I\u2019m worrying we won\u2019t find somewhere we both like if we don\u2019t get it booked soon and that he doesn\u2019t actually want to go anymore. He repeatedly assures me he wants to go and that he\u2019ll get it sorted with his boss, and he does - or so he says. Come February, we finally find our ideal place and book it, we\u2019re excited. A few days after, he says he\u2019s going to have to reschedule our vacation dates due to something at work.  This gets me angry. I told him beforehand that I cannot reschedule my time off work like he can, hence the \u2018nagging\u2019 him previously. I work for a big company, often short staffed and cannot take annual leave if someone else is off work at the same time, whereas he works in a quiet local bar in a small town mostly targeted at older people. After talking, he hadn\u2019t told his boss we\u2019d booked it, only that he was wanting to have time off around summertime and was looking into a vacation. He hadn\u2019t told or confirmed with his boss the dates we were looking at before we booked it, nor did he let him know as soon as we\u2019d booked it. He\u2019d left things until last minute again. To add, the rescheduling is because his boss is having a dispute with another business and it got moved. On occasions leading up to this, his boss has repeatedly said that it isn\u2019t important that my partner be the and is solely a preference because they are friends.  I told him I won\u2019t be going on vacation with him at all now because he refuses to prioritise things properly. If I can\u2019t trust him to complete simple tasks, then I can\u2019t trust him enough to fly to a different country with him, keeping in mind we have never travelled without our families before. I understand that he should be there for his boss, but he should\u2019ve confirmed these dates with him ASAP and take it seriously.AITA for being too extreme?",

        "selftext": "My boyfriend (23) and I (female, 24) met at our corporate job. We hit it off immediately and started dating. Although it might seem odd, this was my first dating experience. In the beginning, he was incredibly sweet, caring, and attentive. He often brought me snacks and cooked meals for me, and I reciprocated as much as I could. While I appreciated his attention, I also wanted to take care of him and show my affection, so I occasionally bought him small gifts. Initially, he was emotional and happy about them. However, over time, he began to criticize the gifts I gave him, calling them useless and not what he wanted. For his birthday, I bought him a childhood game he had mentioned he never got to play but still felt nostalgic about. I thought it would be a thoughtful gift to fulfill his childhood dream, and I added some expensive snacks. He seemed joyful at first, but the next day, he shamed me for it, comparing my gift unfavorably to an even more expensive gift from his best friend. He called my gift childish and useless, gave it to his nephew, and said he couldn't eat the snacks, so he gave them to his brothers. I felt very upset and explained my intentions, but I didn't want to let him control my mood, so I brushed it off and tried to forget about it. After this incident, I became discouraged from buying him anything. One day, I noticed that the calluses on his hands were getting worse, so I bought him weightlifting gloves. As soon as he saw them, he commented on how ugly they were and insisted I should return them. I was just trying to be thoughtful, and I never expected such a reaction. I felt so disappointed, but again, I brushed it off and stopped gifting him anything. For context, he only gave me a gift once, and that was on my birthday. I'm not trying to shame him, but I wish he would consider my thoughtfulness when I buy him things. Even if he didn't like them, he could at least pretend and not put me down. Now, with Valentine's Day approaching, I feel so discouraged from buying him anything. ",

I am also quite handy around the house and don't mind rolling up my sleeves to get dirty, so I also snake any drains when they get clogged up. (Sinks, showers, etc.) This is a skill that I have taught myself out of necessity. It's not something we specifically discussed as being my chore/obligation, but I took it on to be helpful and do my part because we are a team.  That said...He is a man and shaves his face. He does this over his bathroom sink, of course, and makes minimal effort to prevent his trimmings and shaving products from going down the drain even though I have asked him to do better many times. Predictably, his sink needs to be snaked every few months because he has clogged it up yet again. I have taken care of this every time so far, albeit begrudgingly. Anyone who has performed this task will understand just how putrid and vile it can be in there. I am getting tired of cleaning up an easily preventable mess and am refusing to snake his sink this time. I told him he should take care of it, but it remains unaddresed several weeks later. Mind you, he doesn't know how to do it and I have offered to teach him. I am attempting the teach our kid this as well, because it is a life skill.  Also relevant: we have been in our home for like 14 years and I have never had to snake my bathroom sink and have had to snake our shower exactly one time (I do my best to collect my hair and throw it away to prevent it from clogging the drain). I feel like he is a grown ass man who is capable of cleaning up after himself and him refusing to do so is not something I should be punished for.  I also acknowledge that since I have been doing this task that there is a reasonable expectation for me to continue doing it, but this is above and beyond occasional clogs from normal use.  Sooo... AITA? ",

        "selftext": "So for some context, I'm going into my 2nd semester in my 4 bedroom apartment, I had 4 roommates, but two moved out when the 2nd semester started, and one additional roommate moved in. It hasn't been verified but this guy is clearly autistic, but so was the roommate he replaced but we never had any issues with him.Anyways I DEEP cleaned the main areas before he moved in, and within the week after it was trashed. Milk was constantly being left out, he was taking dirty dishes OUT of the sink and spreading them across the counter spaces. On top of that he REFUSED to talk to or even look at us.Me and my other roommate got tired of this and we warned him if he keeps leaving all his stuff out, we were just going to start putting his stuff in his room for him to deal with. For the most part things got better, but he was still leaving stuff out a LOT. It was just usually taken care of by the end of the day.But one day, I noticed an OPEN jar of mayo, an OPEN pack of cheese, and an OPEN pack of ham. We don't share stuff like that so I just shrugged it off because I was in a rush to go to my girlfriend's place. I actually messaged him about it, and I said he needed to put it up, and if he didn't he was going to get sick. Well going into the third day, it was still there. He wasn't, and his door was wide open, so I closed the items, put it on his desk and walked out.THREE days later, he comes to me and says did you go into my room and put this stuff here? My room is a barrier that I want to be respected this is the first time if heard him say this and I did feel bad for doing it, but to my knowledge we were all on the same page.One random story I have of him that's kinda the same topic... he half cooked a chicken, turned off the pan, and went to class... he just... left the chicken... half cooked idk I thought that one was gross",

        "selftext": "One of my close friends, Mitch, left a set of items at my house several years ago when they initially moved out. When I had first bought they and their family lived in the upstairs half of my house. With them they brought along their first set of table and chairs from their first apartment. It's not an heirloom or anything, it's one of those starter sets from Walmart but it's decent wood and metal and it's got sentimental value to them. When they first moved into another apartment on their own about 2-3 years they brought the table, but left 3/4 chairs with me because they didn't have room. They later moved into a larger apartment last year and still haven't taken the chairs. We use them from time to time, it's not like they sit up in an attic, but they are more temporary extra seating than actively part of our decor. They stay in our dining room which has terrible heating and I accidentally left one close to a window and it got really damp and eventually molded all over the seat (the metal was okay). I noticed when I was spring cleaning the dining room and I tried to clean the seat but I couldn't figure out how to get it off and ultimately threw it away, thinking they wouldn't want it back in that state and I still had the other two. They have a new table and chairs set at their current home so if they ever actually want them back these would likely serve the same purpose in their life as my own. This was a few months ago, and today we are helping a mutual friend (Sherry) move. We were discussing furniture and things for Sherry and Mitch mentioned Sherry will be taking those three chairs I have. I admit I only have two because I threw one away since the seat had molded. Mitch is upset that I threw the chair away. They state they could have taken the seat off and replaced it. They ask that I replace the chair. This is from a set of chairs sold at Walmart 6 some odd years ago, I did a cursory internet search and it's pretty much not possible to find even the exact same set and certainly not just one chair. I tell them I will do my best to replace it. They replied that they wish I would have asked first, which is fair enough. We continued the night pretty fine. I know they're still a upset but it'll fade and I'll keep my eyes peeled at lawn sales and thrift shops for a comparable chair. If it's important to them I'll find a way to replace it. Am I the AH for throwing away the chair instead of asking them? It clearly upset them and I respect that but I don't feel as if I did much actually wrong for discarding an item that I didn't even know if or when they'd actually retrieve them, and was technically a biohazard.

        "selftext": "TLDR: Indian FIL is intentionally mispronouncing and misspelling our son\u2019s name because he wanted the more culturally traditional version of his name vs the westernized version. Husband and I are both really bothered by this, but sharing how we feel will likely cause tension and his mother will be caught in the middle (she\u2019s an absolute gem). My son was born 3 months ago. I (31, F) am white, husband (33, M) is half Hispanic and half Indian. We spent a LONG time mulling over names and landed on giving him the same name as my husband\u2019s (long story short - wanted a name that could cross cultures, was easy to pronounce, and had good meaning). The day my son was born, FIL (Indian) really harps on questioning our name choice (which he\u2019d done before). My husband and I then, too, began to doubt ourselves and spent that entire night discussing - finally landing on a name that FIL approved of. The next day, FIL says our spelling and pronunciation of name is bad (he wants his culture\u2019s more traditional way). We made clear we weren\u2019t changing it, and he sat there in the hospital room loudly watching videos on the pronunciation of how he wanted it. EDIT TO ADD: FIL doesn\u2019t have strong accent, speaks fluent English and is fully capable of pronouncing it the way we\u2019ve spelled/pronounce it. Fast forward, he still pronounces it the way he wants to and now even spells it the way he wants to. My husband is on my side that we don\u2019t like it\u2026but I\u2019m questioning if it\u2019s worth causing tension or not. I know it will always bother me, but I am sure I can get by with just being annoyed by it. Context: FIL is one to stop talking to family for periods of time when he feels slighted. He is very particular and causes a lot of family drama\u2026so often we choose to keep the peace for the sake of his mother (who is a saint). He\u2019s the only one with this issue.",

        "selftext": "throwaway acc, dont want personal info on my main.   so the other day my (17 m) dad walked in and asked me if I'd bought any valentines for my mom, stepmom, and brother. I was kind of caught off-guard and i said no, and he told me i needed to 'get on that'. i struggle to tell with him what's a suggestion vs what's a demand/if i don't do it I'll be in trouble, and getting in trouble is very stressful for me for some context: my parents divorced when i was little and have 50/50 custody. both remarried a few years after. mom set firm boundaries with how her and my stepdad parent me, she sees it as her job to parent me and he can be the fun stepdad but he doesn't get to discipline me, that's her job dad took a different approach, and let stepmom do a lot of parenting of me when i was young. we did not have the best relationship in the past , but it's better now, enough to where we can spend time together sometimes and i don't really mind her. she's nice and i appreciate all she does but she's not really a parent to me.   i asked my mom when i next saw her, and she said she doesn't want anything. i might make something as a thank you for her (she always gets me candy and trinkets for valentines since i don't really get valentines otherwise) and maybe i'll grab some candy for my brother since he's a kid (still in elementary) but i've never gotten either of them gifts for valentines before and it's never been an issue, and i dunno if doing that now will cause issues so maybe I'll just get something for little bro im not sure how relevant it is, but i do have suspected autism (multiple professionals we saw highly suspected it and recommended testing)but i haven't been able to get the assessment yet so no official diagnosis.   i only mention this because I'm not always the best with social situations, so it's not unheard of to be told I was rude on accident/am not doing something the way it's supposed to be done. but at the same time, I feel like it would've come up sooner if it was something expected of me? I'm not sure, I don't want to be rude at all I'm mostly just confused i dunno what dad will say if i don't get her anything, i don't want it to be a big deal really i just think it's kind of odd, but now I'm thinking about just getting her something small to avoid any fights. valentines day is approaching fast and I'm kinda nervous about it   so, WIBTA if i don't get her anything ? I'm genuinely not sure anymore. my friends i asked said it's fine but most of my friends don't really like my dad (and are also MY friends so ofc they'd side with me..) so I'd like an unbiased opinion on this. thanks for the help",

When his flight Sim broke, he asked me to fix it. I politely told him I can't fix everything, it's probably a simple issue, this is a good test for you. You should try and fix it. Start with steam, get the quest to connect to steam and then try to get it to connect to flight Sim. If you still have trouble, I will help but you need to try yourself. he then responded can't I just reinstall windows and start from scratch?. I told him, no don't do that, we installed loads of crazy drivers to get your Mac studio display to work on a pc. If you reinstall Windows, that will all be gone and I Dont wanna have to go through that nightmare again. Do not reaintall windows.

The main ones that are important in this story are Tachycardia and chronic pain: I wear a hip brace and sometimes a knee brace for, but I'm trying to get a cane (the pain isn't only in those spots, it's basically all my joints and bones, but that's all my dad will let me get things for(will get into later)). I also have a lot of mental issues which are all diagnosed and I take medicine for. Alright, onto the main story. Due to my health issues, I've been trying to convince my dad to let me go to the doctors' to get checked out + I want to go so I can help prove to insurance that I need a cane (which multiple people in the health field have recommended), but my dad won't listen to me about that. He won't even let me get wrist braces. Because of the pain, I complain a lot about how my body hurts, and my dad tells me If you're so used to it, then it's not a big deal and stuff like that. We've gotten into arguments about this multiple times but I've mainly given up trying to convince him. But then came today; I had a really important meeting with a psychiatrist today which could effect the rest of my life. I had been stressing about it since last week since it's my second meeting with them. I was going to get picked up at around 1, but my dad texted me. He told me(summarized) Hey, I have to cancel the meeting until they have an opening because my heart is feeling really bad right now. Plus my head hurts badly and I might have to go the doctors' later.When he sent this, I became furious because he described his symptoms, it was the exact same things I've been dealing with since I was 11, and he's always tried downplaying it.Here's where I may be the A-hole. Instead of telling my dad Oh! I hope you feel better or something, I told him Have you taken an advil plus drank water? Or have you rested enough? Ir's probably just acid-reflux and then You should be fine after you take medicine and water. He told me that he still felt bad and that I should be more considerate.I feel bad because when he picked me up at the normal time to head home instead of early for the meeting, he sounded really in pain and tired: and I had been really rude over text. But at the same time, I feel pretty satisfied that he got mad at me for downplaying his symptoms and acting like it was an everyday thing to feel bad (which it is for me) the same way he did to me. I don't know, it's a weird situation. Any perspectives are welcome and I'm fine if I was in the wrong, I just can't tell right now.",

We have a nice sized house. We all have our own rooms. I work at an after school program so it's from 1:30 to 6:00 not a lot of hours but It's still work. I'm going to start College in the summer, fingers crossed. Anyway my brother B also works at an after school program same hours as me. Neither of us drive so He bikes and I take an Electric scooter which I payed for myself. So I typically get home before him.  The only difference between us is that he has a SHIT ton more freedom than I do. Which is fine I don't mind he has a lot of friends and goes out a lot. After work or on the weekends. Or even sometimes on the weekdays. So when I'm home my siblings E and T are also home.  My parents D and P (my step mom) are extremely social people so they always have something going on. And E and T aren't always allowed to join them on their adventures for example when they go out to have adult hang outs or parties. The times my parents stay out really late. And I do mean late they usually come back between 12:00 to 2:00am. Which I don't mind. They're adults and they can enjoy their lives.  What annoys me though is that whenever my parents leave T and E in our care (I say our care because B is supposed to help too) but it usually ends up just being me taking care of them, making them dinner, keeping them entertained, making sure they get to bed on time. Thing like that. On top of that we recently just got a puppy her name is Stella and she's only 10 weeks old so she needs to constantly be watched. And in the mornings before I leave for work I watch Stella and my other dog Diva who's only a year old. No help from him whatsoever. He stays in his room until he leaves for work or wakes up at 11:00. We both have ADHD and have medication. So we have to take it in the morning.  Anyway lately it's been getting worse. P always leaves us a list of chores she wants done before we both go to work (which is fine because I genuinely need a visual list for me to be able to get things done) And I usually end up doing 90% of them since B doesn't wake up or just doesn't leave his room. Don't get me wrong it's not that he never helps he just rarely does so. But it's so frustrating when I'm watching the kids or the dogs and doing chores while he chills in his room playing videogames. It's not like he works anymore than I do. Or does anything about the house when he is home. Plus when he randomly decides to go out guess who's stuck doing extra chores that HE should be doing? Me. It's getting really annoying, Even my parents are getting frustrated with his lack of helping. But he doesn't seem to care. AITA for telling him to do stuff around the house?",

I also removed her on all socials. Her boyfriend and mine are obviously aware of this, and my boyfriend is not her biggest fan as a result of this (and his best friend is aware of how we both feel about her as they spoke after).  Now were planning the party and lots of our friends have significant others who are invited to the party. We didn't specify on the invite whether plus ones are allowed, we just used an app to manually invite everyone (including s/os who's numbers we had) and then those who are bringing someone we dont know just add their own plus one. I'm not sure if we need to pre-emptively clarify to him that she's not invited? WWBTAs if we don't send her an invite? We obv have her number so when we send out the app invites, he will get one and she wont and they will be able to see that other s/os got one (the app shows  a list of invitees and their RSVP status to everyone).  (i would personally expect them to not invite me and I wouldn't go even if i was), I'm also concerned that if we invite her to be polite she'll think everything is cool (it is not) and I also don't want to set the precedent of her expecting an invite to other special events like birthday or weddings etc?

My mother (55f) has always been very neglectful and abusive. So much that my sibling and i were in and out of foster care our entire lives. I do have contact with my mother but i honestly hate her. Recently I asked her if I were to put a two drink maximum for alcohol at the wedding, is it rude. She asked why and I explained I didnt want people to get out of control. Mainly my sister who is an extreme alcoholic and has been since she was a teenager. My mother berated me and told me its rude and i shouldn't be excluding certain people. I made the comment then maybe we will have a dry wedding instead and that upset her as well but ultimately said it's your wedding do what you want. It wasnt what she said it was how she said it. With her attitude I'm considering not inviting her at all. She always makes a spectacle of herself and is overbearing. I also dont want my sister coming because she is super extra and both of them will end up fighting over one thing or another. So would ibta for inviting them and keeping our wedding small and drama free?",

        "selftext": "Last year, my fianc\u00e9 and I signed a lease for a townhome while planning our wedding, and I decided to get a roommate to help with expenses since we are living separately to save for the wedding. The place is furnished by us, but I left one room downstairs empty. My fianc\u00e9 stayed with me briefly approx. 3 weeks due to family issues, she only needed a place to sleep, and I made sure to talk to him about it, and he was fine with it.  Things got uncomfortable when my roommate got back with his girlfriend, who began spending more time at the house. It started with occasional visits, but soon, she was here so often it felt like she practically lived with us. I\u2019d come home to find her asleep on the couch, eating food from the fridge, she has her own place. This wasn\u2019t a huge problem at first, but it became more frequent, and she\u2019d sometimes be in the house when no one else was. Then my roommate had a friend stay for a week, leaving a mess. Although they cleaned it up eventually, it was annoying and uncomfortable. I decided to talk to my roommate about it, expressing that it was the frequency of his girlfriend being over that bothered me, and how it was affecting the shared living spaces. He was visibly annoyed and didn\u2019t talk to me much after that. Things didn\u2019t improve, and over time, I felt like I couldn\u2019t relax in the common areas because it seemed like they were irritated when I was around. I started staying in my room to avoid the tension. I didn\u2019t want to make things worse by bringing it up again, so I vented to my fianc\u00e9. She suggested I speak to him again, but I didn\u2019t want to keep pushing the issue. Eventually, I got the flu and decided to stay at my mom\u2019s house because I couldn\u2019t relax at home with his girlfriend there. My fianc\u00e9, not knowing where I was, drove over to check on me. I explained why I wasn\u2019t at the townhome, and she asked if I\u2019d talked to my roommate about my concerns. I admitted I hadn\u2019t. My fianc\u00e9 offered to talk to him since she\u2019s better at communicating, but when she did, he got annoyed, saying he could have his girlfriend over as much as he wanted since he paid bills & she is not someone he should have this conversation with only with me. Later, when I spoke to him, he said that if I could have my fianc\u00e9  living there, he should be allowed to have his girlfriend & any guest as much as he wants (my fianc\u00e9 only stayed 3 weeks, she has been here for 3 months). I tried explaining it wasn\u2019t about her staying over, but how frequently she was there. He accused me of double standards, which wasn\u2019t my intention. I don\u2019t want to micromanage him, but it bothers me when she\u2019s here alone or when he brings random people over. I even suggested that if he and his girlfriend want to live together, they could find their own place, but he just walked away, and nothing was resolved.",

The wife often has explosive rows with her husband and gets really ugly verbally. I can hear it and she has apologised to me a few times after. I have always said nw and that it\u2019s their house and I understand.  Recently, the topic of noise in shared spaces came up again and I mentioned that while the noise doesn\u2019t bother me , sometimes I do get anxious when they fight that she will scream at me if I do something as she\u2019s already angry.  While she did not say anything atm, shortly after she sent me a couple long texts on WhatsApp to express that she was v upset at what I had said and that I was completely unjustified and unfair for what I said and to not come in to their living room and being my own issues to her( I tried justifying how I felt anxious by saying I have a habit of internalising other peoples emotions). She also said I would never understand what they argue over because of my age ( I am atleast a decade younger than them both).  While we have both apologised, her apology felt like \u2018 I am sorry you feel this way BUT\u2019.  I have a few weeks of my tenancy left but this exchange has genuinely left me feeling very stressed.  Am I not allowed to express how I feel? Is it not wrong for her to say I should not bring my issues to her ( I don\u2019t! ) but she can air hers out loud enough for me to hear? Is it also not mean to basically call me stupid and make me feel bad by saying they\u2019re having a really hard time in their relationship? I never asked her to justify why they fight, simply that her anger makes me anxious for myself.  I am just v taken back by her texts and feel like I will have to navigate around her feelings and hide from her the rest of my tenancy.",

Since moving in it has become apparent that Jane does not clean or tidy often, I have taken on the majority share of housework and maintain a clean and tidy apartment. She has a 6yr old chihuahua (Buster) who is not properly trained and regularly goes to the bathroom throughout the house. Buster usually does his business on the floor of her room when she isn\u2019t around.  Jane\u2019s room constantly smells and is never tidied. She leaves clothes and other items on the floor which buster will use as a bathroom. Jane is going away on holiday for two weeks and asked if I will take care of buster otherwise she will have to pay for a kennel. this means cleaning up after him at least twice a day for 2 weeks. I requested in exchange for dog sitting buster that Jane\u2019s room be completely clean and nothing left on the floor. Allowing me to go into the room and clean effectively.  As part of my request I reminded her about how unhygienic the room is when buster is constantly using it as a toilet and that the smell is unbearable for me. She was immediately defensive stating that it didn\u2019t smell and she was doing well cleaning it. I ended the conversation saying that those were my conditions. Am I the asshole for requesting that she clean or should I leave it alone because it\u2019s her room?",

My mum works 4 days a week away from home and my dad works a 4 days on/off schedule. In the day, because I am the only one in the house, I do all the housework because if I leave a single thing that hasn\u2019t been done my mum goes ballistic and complains that I have done no work. She also has ruled out certain tasks I do in the house as not being chores (like the dish washing), so even if I do them it means I haven\u2019t done any work in the day. Because I am going into the forces, I also go to the gym/home workout every weekday. This means that by the time I\u2019ve done everything that needs to be done it\u2019s mid afternoon and the time my parents come home. I see them, make them a cup of tea and spend some time with them. We then eat dinner together, I do the washing up after that then go upstairs. The thing is, the whole day I have not spoken to a single friend, as they\u2019ve all gone off to uni and usually spend the evenings talking and chatting to them on games. However my mum often says that I hardly see her and gets annoyed that I don\u2019t spend my evenings with them. However, if I do this I don\u2019t speak to a single friend. I\u2019m now writing this after I had a very stressful day at work, I came back at early evening and I just want to sit back and relax in quiet in my own space, and my mum comes charging into my room shouting at me that I never see her and only see her in car journeys. This has happened a few times now and it\u2019s just made me want to spend less time with her, because I feel like it\u2019s forced now. She also guilt trips by saying \u201cwe know what you prefer\u201d, context being that I prefer to spend time with friends up in my room than to see my family allegedly.  I feel bad that I don\u2019t spend time with them, but the truth is that I often don\u2019t want to because they don\u2019t do much other than sit and watch TV and do their own things in the day. I just get bored because no one seems keen to do anything that we all do together. I have also noticed that my dad and sister never talk or shout at me about any of this, in fact my sister literally says I like to \u201ctuck myself away\u201d and \u201cdo my own thing\u201d.

        "selftext": "Hey Reddit, I\u2019m a 36-year-old dealing with some unresolved family and financial issues from my past, and I need your perspective. The Backstory:I worked full time at my parents\u2019 Quiznos for about five years. Based on the minimum wage rates during those years (assuming 40 hours per week), I should have earned roughly $72K in gross wages. After subtracting partial payments they made\u2014specifically, $600 per month for 4 months (totaling $2,400) while I was in college, plus an extra $400 they gave to cover divorce lawyer fees\u2014I calculated a net claim of around $69,400. Family Dynamics and My Situation:\t\u2022\tI lived with my parents until June 2007. Later, I returned and stayed with them for about half a year before eventually getting kicked out. After that, I ended up moving from couch to couch.\t\u2022\tMy immigration status was a huge issue because my parents never set it up correctly. I ended up with no proper status, and my mom even told me I should have saved money since I was essentially on my own.\t\u2022\tThroughout all of this, my dad never actually paid me what I was owed for the work I did\u2014even though I was working full time and handling responsibilities well beyond just making sandwiches. My Request:Now, after all these years, I\u2019m asking my parents for the back pay I\u2019m owed. I know this might stir up family drama, especially since they own the business, and I\u2019m aware that some might see it as ungrateful. But the fact remains: I worked for them, I wasn\u2019t paid what I was owed, and I\u2019ve been left to deal with the financial fallout for decades. So, AITA for asking my parents for the back pay from my time working at Quiznos? I\u2019d appreciate any thoughts or advice on whether my request is fair given the circumstances. Thanks in advance. \u2014 Conarly  UPDATE So I graduated high school in June of 2006 and started in march of 2006.. I was 17 at the time a minor until November 2006 where I turned 18 .. from November till may I worked almost 72hr due to him getting in an accident.. I then got told to go live in England because me and my dad was having trouble getting along.. I went to England paid by my parents yes.. worked in England moved to Germany and came back a year and a half later.. I was 20 Turning 21 I live with my parents 6 months after that when I was kicked out again..due to standing up for my self asking for some sort of pay or recognition.. without a visa I had no choice but to work for my dad who said he\u2019ll pay me $4 an hour to keep it under the radar of the irs since I was illegally here in the USA.. btw he didn\u2019t pay me the $4 dollars an hour he would make calculations on how I\u2019d be left with a 4 dollar paycheck.. I was living on a friends couch working for my dad and having another job at another Quiznos. Friend kicked me out after 3 weeks after he blamed his pot on me.. I went to another friends house when I stayed on they couch paid rent while working both jobs and barley having anything left over.. I worked for my dad til the age of 23 where I would finally have enough of his abuse and quit. By the way since this time I\u2019ve built myself a pretty good life.. I have worked hard on shredded the verbal and physical abuse that my dad gave me my whole life.. I got married got papers and now have legal immigration status here in the us due to my hard work.. another thing is I am requesting now after all this time is because one.. I don\u2019t like feeling taken advantage without ever being able to get right about the situation.. so I think if I move forward at least pay me for wages when I didn\u2019t live with you and didn\u2019t get to save a thing before you kicked me out without a leg to stand on.. another reason why I\u2019m asking my old employer to pay me is because he couldn\u2019t at the time and that\u2019s the reason he kept giving.. he now came into a life changing amount of money and I\u2019m asking for my wages that\u2019s it\u2019s.. not trying to sue for more than what I didn\u2019t get paid",

I have a hard time supporting it because I personally think it's theft. I also am going to school to for animation so it's a very personal gripe. I told him numerous times about how I'm worried about how this technology will impact me landing a job in the future and how the whole concept pisses me off. This was before he even started down the whole content creation stuff.He empathized with me and I thought he understood but he clearly didn't. He went as far as to hide what he was doing for a while before finally telling me about it. He's pretty upset that l'm unsupportive but he already knew how I felt about it. I don't get why he expects me to change my mind on it, especially when it's unnecessary. There are a million ways to make videos he doesn't need to generate these images. But he keeps trying to show me to change my mind. He says It's actually not that easy it took me a long time to generate all of these images. Can't you just be happy for me? It's hard, I know that he's always wanted to make videos and it's the first time in a while that he's been so excited but I just don't get why he has to do it this way. Am I being a jerk? Should I just suck it up and be more supportive?",

        "selftext": "To give some back story I am about 14 weeks pregnant, my shower is planning for May 31st. my SIL and MIL asked me about a month ago to ask to plan my baby shower and I told them both that they could work together on this. I just found out I\u2019m having a girl about last week and was waiting to give them the go on planning the shower, I wanted to know the gender first then pick a theme then. I ended up picking Winnie the Pooh for the theme. My SIL and MIL are both control freaks, they both need to be in control of every situation and especially in party planning. I am not that way, I am the type of person that would be happy to do whatever is needed. They just had a lunch regarding baby shower talk, I thought this is a collaborating meeting and they would be delegating who would be doing what and paying for what. Mind you, my SIL is not contributing much but her time. My mil is contributing time and money. When the meeting was done, my SIL called me after the lunch and stated that my MIL was mad and completely changed when my SIL told her that everything was handled. Me and my MIL were under the impression that this was going to be a collaborative meeting, I didn\u2019t know my SIL had basically figured out everything already. My MIL was taken back by this understandably but my MIL is also very detailed orientated and wants things her done her way. My MIL states she has no say in the shower now and does not want to be apart of this anymore. I later asked my SIL to let her have some of the duties and my SIL basically said everything is done and there is nothing to do. My MIL called my husband and stated \u201cif you don\u2019t want me in this child\u2019s life just tell me\u201d over a disagreement over a baby shower and a discussion that I was not even involved in. I hate drama and I would rather not have the drama go on and cancel the baby shower entirely. Am I the asshole to cancel it entirely so they both cannot continue their antics? It\u2019s all very childish in my opinion. ",

This time, several members of the cast went out separately (including me), but did not invite a person in the cast we did not get along with. This girl (we can call her Janice) has caused problems with me and my friends for the past four years. She has been constantly jealous of my best friend and has been attempting to take every opportunity she gets away from her. Before our show closed, I and my close friends went out to eat WITHOUT Janice. She saw this as a personal attack and told her mother, who then posted to Facebook saying, Seriously? You're overheard making plans, and then you lie about it to purposely exclude people? Nice... really nice. I and my friends were all extremely angry about this post and met up to talk about it. Janice found out and attempted to insert herself into the situation. We politely declined, explaining that we had our own plans and would spend time with her later. Her mother then added to her previous post, Some people just need to grow up. I and my friends were infuriated and have not responded yet. The majority of my friend group are adults, including Janice, and we are very disappointed in her reaction. I am done with Janice's immature behavior and her mother, who backs her up on every single situation that doesn't favor her. What do you think of Reddit? ",

My dad (57M) and brother, both heavy drinkers, have been bitter about my girlfriend and me living together and consider us immoral for occasionally smoking a certain green substance\u2014despite their own reckless drinking habits, even in the car.

My dad has always influenced me to act against my values, and I\u2019m trying to break that cycle. My brother's only friend (23M), another heavy drinker, regularly cheats on his long-term girlfriend in public behind her back, and I don\u2019t want to be part of that toxic environment.

However, lately her and her boyfriend (19 m) have been having some issues. I never liked her boyfriend to begin with, and my friend has always known that. Him and I have had our fair share of screaming matches since they got together and if I lacked the impulse control we probably still would. One thing I noticed when him and I would have these screaming matches is that he would tell me things that my friend hadn't told me.  Last week she called me at 7:00 AM to complain to me about her boyfriend for what felt like the hundredth time. I was sick at the time so hadn't been getting much sleep but looking back at it I honestly don't regret a word I said. I'll write how the conversation went but I will use fake names for privacy and respect. Me: Hey, I'm still pretty sick so I'm really tired right now, is everything alright?  Kayla: *sobbing* Dominic is being so mean right now, we were supposed to meet for coffee but we got into a fight this morning and now he won't talk to me  Me: Kayla just give it some time, try to breath and maybe you two can go for coffee tomorrow or do something later  Kayla: I don't wanna do it tomorrow I wanna do it today!  Me: I know, but Kayla I've tried to tell you before that when you two get like this it's not healthy and you both just need to give each other some space.  Kayla: This is so stupid, I don't get why he's like this  Me: I've tried to tell you multiple times that I honestly don't think you guys are right for each other, you call me like this almost every other day  Kayla: No I love him, we're just having a tough time right now.  Me: Kayla I'm sorry but I'm sick of this, you call me like this all the time for advice and you never listen. I've tried to help you multiple times but clearly you don't want help, you just want to complain and I'm not the person you should do that to. I've been way to stressed right now to deal with dumb things like these and you know it. I can't control you but I've tried to give you advice so many times, so if you don't wanna listen then I'm not going to either. You can take my advice or don't talk to me about him anymore.  Then she hung up the phone but I was to tired and to sick to care. I texted her later in the day apologizing for being so harsh but I told her my point still stands. She didn't respond so I left it at that but I've tried to text or talk to her about unrelated things and she's still ignoring me. AITA?",

        "selftext": "My (23M) friend/flatmate (34f) has a very sweet and loving cat that I believe she is not looking after very well.  For context she is a very busy university student currently studying a masters degree. Her cat has a history of running rampant in her room, has destroyed plants and various things, gone to the toilet on mine and a flatmates bed, and just done various other chaotic acts.  Personally, I believe he does these things because of her neglect and lack of care. Firstly she takes him on multiple 5+ hour car journeys a year whenever she goes home from uni. She keeps him in a cage that is just big enough to fit his bed, litter tray and food/water bowls whenever she is out (so he doesn't destroy things). He never goes outside even on walks with her. He is barely allowed outside of her room even when he is out of the cage because of his destructive nature.  He had an injury lately which meant he had to have a cone on his head and be in the cage for a while and even though the cone is off, the cage remains. She uses excuses like he is a chaotic cat and there is too much stuff in her room for him to destroy, but honestly most of it is trinkets and things she never uses that could easily be tidied away or thrown out if she wanted to give the cat more freedom. Or plants she keep buying even though she knows he will probably just knock more over.  He is such a lovely cat, very gentle when he is calm, he loves pets and attention and is really quite intelligent. I have been looking after him while she is away with instructions to feed him twice a day and put him back in the cage whenever I'm done. It just feels so wrong. I have played with him when I can and let him roam the house but he tried to jump out a barely open window in the 2nd floor, which just kind of shows how desperate he is to explore and have more freedom.  She does care for this cat but I am worried she is just using him as an emotional support without fully having the capacity to look after him well enough. He is a bit overweight and she spoils him with treats (like over Christmas he had 4 advent calenders) but he clearly isn't getting enough excercise. Her mental health is not good and she got him straight after her previous cat died so I want to approach this gently but firmly with her. I'm not sure what to say. Also when she takes him to her parents home, the cat is suddenly in a multiple cat household (although they all get along apparently) and allowed to roam for the most part. But she and the vet believe this is where his injury came from (fox bite) and I'm sure it must be very unstable for him going between the two: from extreme freedom to caged life. When she is home he can be out of his cage, but again just in one room and I often hear her telling him off because he just gets overstimulated and runs around.  What do I say to her that won't break our friendship but ensure this cat gets better treatment? ",

House proceeds with furthermore be referred to as savings At first it was fun and fine he hung out with us after work and school and allowed us to have a date night about once a month since I was spending my savings to compensate him not having enough money to cover his third of the rent (he doesn't pay for any other bills other than periodic groceries. More to come on this). Now my savings is gone after having to support him and my family while my fiance got settled into a new job.

I've been with my partner for 8 years and she's aware of how much this means to me. I do want to note that I'm more than happy to miss out on any other game, and often record games or miss out entirely for every other game of the season. However, this season we are in a final the day before my mother and father in law go on a holiday that we organised for them to go to New York. We had previously agreed to go to the hotel with them to see them off the day before, but I never anticipated that my team would get into the final.  I've expressed to my partner that this could be one of the biggest days of not only following this team, but also in my life as I've never seen them win a final and want to do it the right way if it happens. She's suggested watching it on my phone, or recording it, but it honestly won't feel the same, and I know that I will be miserable/thinking of it the whole day if I don't watch it live to go to the hotel. We'd had conversation about this at the shop, and when we got back she'd clearly taken it badly as she told her mum straight away. I feel like I've been thrown under the bus by my partner without giving it time for me to settle on this/think about it, and it's made me anxious as I'd never want to disappoint or upset my mother in law. Half my problem is that she knows I get anxious and it sometimes stops me from even going downstairs if I feel like my mother in law is annoyed etc. I'm not sure if I'm being the asshole here if I was to stay home/go out to watch the final instead of going to the hotel with them to see them off?

        "selftext": "On mobile, apologize if the formatting is rough.  For backstory, my (24F) maternal grandmother (J) passed away when she was 33 and my mother was 5. My grandfather had 5 children in total with her. In true Dutch fashion, he put out an ad in Holland for a \u201chousekeeper\u201d, who he married about a year after she (B) moved in. From that time forward, my mother and her 4 full siblings were expected to call this new woman mom and no one ever spoke of their actual mother. B had two children with my grandfather, who she favoured to the point of severely neglecting the other 5 she was supposed to be a mother to. My grandfather, never one for things like emotion and accountability, would ignore, aid and abet, or flat out deny any form of mistreatment from day one until present day.  Most of my aunts and uncles have already made it clear that they refuse to forgive without at bare minimum an apology from the both of them, which has never occurred. My mom however, (now 49F), has been working on her relationship with them and has done her best to forgive and let the past be the past. From what I\u2019ve heard from her and my Dad (49M) about it, it has helped her with her mental health etc. which has suffered a lot for the majority of her life. I have two main points on why I hold my grudge. First, I didn\u2019t know that B wasn\u2019t my bio grandmother until I was 17, and my older sister told me the truth. I still know virtually nothing about J, other than that older sister was named after her. I never had a relationship with my mom that felt like anything other than walking on eggshells and just having a woman who lives in my house and cooks and cleans and does laundry etc. I still barely know her, though I love her deeply and hold nothing against her. I know that it\u2019s solely because of her childhood trauma that she wasn\u2019t the mother I always wanted and needed, so I don\u2019t see it as her fault really. Secondly and more personally, my mom once told me that my grandfather at one point \u201cheld me down in bed until I fell asleep\u201d once when I was very young and staying the night there. I know I was a particularly needy child and have always had issues with sleep, which is what he used to justify it at the time. Now, he is both losing his cognitive abilities and would most certainly deny it ever happening to his grave. This event naturally traumatized me. My mom either doesn\u2019t know anything else about the incident or simply is unable to tell me because any time I\u2019ve attempted to bring it up to her she instantly bursts into tears, and I can see and feel how much guilt she carries about it. I don\u2019t blame her for any of this. The reason I\u2019m not sure if I would be TA is because I don\u2019t want my negative feelings and borderline hatred of my mom\u2019s parents to affect her mental health negatively or impact my relationship with her. So reddit, AITA for having no desire to find peace and forgiveness with them?",

        "selftext": "I'm a 26-year-old woman with a male cat named Michelangelo, or Mikey. He was initially a gift from my mom and her boyfriend to my sister-in-law (SIL) when he was just a tiny kitten. My brother and SIL lived with me then in our shared apartment. However, they leave Mikey behind when they decide to move out and find their own place. I took it upon myself to look after him. I've been responsible for all his needs, from feeding him to taking him to the vet and buying litter. Lately, I've realized that my sister-in-law treats Mikey as if he still belongs to her, even though she has shown little interest in or care for him since they moved out. She never checks in on him or contributes financially to his care, which I find frustrating. My brother and SIL argue that it doesn't matter who cares for the cat because my mom gifted Mikey to my sister-in-law. They believe that since she was the one who received him, she has a right to call him her cat. However, it's unfair for her to claim ownership of Mikey when she has abandoned him and doesn't participate in his care. Compounding the issue, my brother and sister-in-law are planning to move into a new place that doesn't allow pets, which means they would be unable to take Mikey with them regardless. Given this situation, I feel justified in asserting that Mikey is my cat since I am the one taking care of him. So, AITA for referring to Mikey as my cat?",

        "selftext": "For context, I have a close friend whom I\u2019ve known since middle school whose mental and physical health have suffered a lot in the past two years, and I really do feel for her but sometimes our relationship has been much more difficult lately than it used to be because she now needs a lot more attention than I can give, and there\u2019s been tension between us on and off for a while. Right now she is extra unhappy with me. My husband and I suffered a miscarriage this month and right now there is a condolence gift from her waiting for me at the post office since Tuesday (it\u2019s Sunday) because no one was home to sign for it, and I have not had the energy (or the burning desire, to be honest) to go pick it up.  This is probably made worse by the fact that she is someone who wants to hang out all the time, and I haven\u2019t wanted to see anybody or do anything in about 3 weeks. She sent a card too which was very sweet, and I thanked her for that and thanked her for sending me a gift, but I let her know that I didn\u2019t have a chance to pick it up yet and was not sure exactly when I would. I will pick it up. I will! But I want to give myself a minute. Because: 1. I don\u2019t like stuff. It doesn\u2019t actually matter what it is. My love language is not gifts. When I buy something and bring it into our house, I choose it really carefully and think about it for a long time. I can pretend well enough to be gracious and give people the response they want from me when I receive a gift, but my true feelings are that I hate receiving gifts because they almost always become a chore, one more thing to add to the pile of things to find a new home for without just chucking them and adding to the landfills. I hate things, I can never punt enough things out of my home fast enough, and I hate this about our culture. 2. Trips to the post office are my least favorite kind of errand. Our post office doesn\u2019t have a parking lot, there are always lines, etc. I avoid having to go there even when I\u2019m not depressed and dealing with something, so the truth is I\u2019m a little annoyed that she set me up for an obligatory post office trip. Though I know better than to ket her know that.  She doesn\u2019t understand and is upset that I didn\u2019t make haste to cut through my grief and depression to go pick up this gift (which yes, as an aside, has a very good chance of being something I will not want, and which I\u2019ll need to drum up energy to find a new home for at some point.) Am I cranky, depressive, isolating? Yes. But am I allowed? AITA?",

Alright, so I am a girl and I won't say much for privacy reasons but I do need advice. I have a crush me and her are close since 6th grade we did date but we broke up due to my mother being the type of parent that only supports the lgbtq+ if its not family.   Lately me and my crush who I will call Love for the time being. Me and love have reconnected I never lost feelings since I didn't even want to break up but me and Love been talking on the phone a lot and we like to call while playing games together. But lately its every single day. Don't get me wrong I love hanging out with Love.   But we do have school and I am the type of person who wants to work hard so you can have a good life and I believe school is the best thing to focus on. Love has been skipping school to talk and call me a lot and likes to message me during class naturally I don't respond unless I finish all my work.   But its getting to the point that I get messages 24/7 I fine with a clingy partner since above all this is my fault since I know this is how she is but everyday after school she wants to immediately call and play games and its getting exhausting. Then I feel bad if I don't respond back or say I can't because she will message with oh..okay  And even if I respond with I can't because I am either doing homework or school work or watching a movie which is always true as I never want to lie to Love she would still text do you wanna call and play games. Even today when I told her I was looking for a movie while eating dinner I had just finished making she immediately respond with do you want to call and play games.  All I need is some advice to what you do since the long nights of calling and playing games is effecting me hard as I like to sleep at 5:25 pm for a rested night but she likes to keep calling at 4 am which is the time I get ready since I need to catch the bus for school due to it being a private type school which I can't afford to get kicked out of.

        "selftext": "So just a brief intro, I was living away from home for uni up until recently, and my brothers (29 + 23) are still living there, having never moved out for a whole host of reasons which I won't get into here but will be happy to elaborate on if anyone is interested. It basically boils down to substance abuse issues and then getting the easy life at home, being provided for by my 60 year old mother. She buys all their food, amongst other things, that's important to keep in mind. I recently moved back to my mum's in order to save money while I save to move country to do my masters degree. It has been quite unbearable, to be honest, trying to adjust to the lack of independence. Anyway lol, I have a pretty specific diet, namely Whole Foods, Plant Based - I don't eat added/processed sugar, dairy/meat/animal products etc. Because of this, I buy ALL my own food and don't touch the stuff my mum buys for them bc they eat a pretty Standard American Diet, which is of no interest to me.  The issue is, for the last few months since I moved back, my food is constantly being eaten. Despite the fact that I have taken to writing my name on my food with black sharpie as they were (potentially feigning) ignorance originally. Just this week for example, a good lot of my veg has been eaten, they somehow went through a full loaf of wholegrain bread overnight, my hummus was half eaten, my falafel, pickles, no-added sugar baked beans, my homemade veg burgers amongst others were all eaten. Bizarrely, my vegan cheese was eaten when they have actual dairy cheese available to them IN THE SAME FRIDGE. I have said to them multiple times, but they get very defensive and say it's only a few quid or it's only frozen veg, what like 40p? I have said to my mum as well twice now, tho I don't want to go on at her bc it's not her problem and she's already stressed enough, and her response is pretty much the same, even saying what do you expect of course they'll eat what's in the fridge. There is no acknowledgement on my brothers' parts of the fact that it's not really about the money (tho that's certainly part of it), but about the principal of respect and boundaries. I feel like I'm genuinely going insane. Should I stop going on about it? I do feel like an AH for bringing it up all the time, but then i also feel strongly that their behaviour should change and not my reaction to it. Idk, what do yous think? ",

Yeah, this is kind of weird, but I needed to ask because I'm autistic and also aroace, so I'm not too great with social stuff, especially for Valentine\u2019s Day, so I was wondering if I was in the wrong here. Recently my (18m) best friend (18f) asked me for some help with making a gift for her boyfriend (again 18m). They\u2019ve been dating for a few months, and her boyfriend and I happen to have similar interests, and I like crafts, so she originally asked me to help her make some matching bracelets for them, which I was super excited to do. I even ordered some new materials to do so since all my bracelet-making stuff has gotten kind of old and brittle. Earlier this week, though, she told me that I wouldn\u2019t have to make them anymore, which was a little sad, but I could still use the materials to make gifts for the rest of our friend group (which I want to be a surprise). Anyways, this is all to say I know she\u2019s planning to give him something on Valentine\u2019s Day. likely handmade since she likes crafts as well. Recently she texted me that she didn\u2019t even want flowers for Valentine\u2019s Day anymore, and when I asked why, she explained that her boyfriend was making it sound like a hassle to get her them. I was pretty upset, but I just told her that it was a weird thing for him to say. I would like to add this is not a thing of flowers being expensive or anything he can very much afford it. He simply doesn\u2019t want to go out of the way to get them for her. Also, she literally had to ask him to make him get her those flowers. Not sure if it was a Valentine's gift in general, but definitely for the flowers. This is where I might be the asshole. I decided to go to the store and buy some construction paper, following a YouTube tutorial I saw to try and make her a paper bouquet. I originally thought it\u2019d be a nice gesture, especially if her boyfriend doesn\u2019t get her the flowers. I don\u2019t have many friends in real life, so I told one of my online friends about it since I didn\u2019t want to spoil the surprise. They ended up scolding me, though, and told me I was overstepping and that it\u2019d be like I was trying to one-up her boyfriend. I didn\u2019t think I was wrong at first, but now I'm conflicted. I don\u2019t want to one up him or anything I just want to make my friend happy. So yeah, would I be the asshole if I gave my best friend a paper bouquet for Valentine\u2019s Day? EDIT: Forgot to say it\u2019s normal for the two of us to give each other gifts on Valentine\u2019s Day. We\u2019ve been doing it ever since we were kids I\u2019m talking about the specific gift because I\u2019m going to be giving her something no matter what.",

Zach wants Joe to go to a medical school and become a doctor like him but Joe applied to a law school instead and gained admission. I have encouraged them to talk calmly. Hank, Zach\u2019s sister and I told Joe that if push comes to shove we will help pay for law school. We have enough money between the three of us to pay the tuitions, the costs of textbooks and the food, should his dad refuse to support him. But he should also give thought to talking to his dad. Their last conversation was basically a shouting match.

And bear in mind that I am NOT close enough with this person for him to be making jokes like that and personally I think it's blanatanly rude for someone's first reaction to you telling them your MUMS age to be and exclamation of how rude she is! So I was like 'okay...that was a bit rude' and then the rest of my friends proceeded to jump on how I'm saying that being old is a bad thing and how I'm saying again isn't beautiful, none of which I think, aging is a beautiful and lucky thing to be able to experience BUT to call a woman  'old'- yes she's past Middle Ag but I would not say she's old? Old is 65-70+ personally- espeiaclly when that woman is my mum,of course it's rude! In my head, if he were to meet my mum and say that too her face, he wouldn't, because it's rude! It was then bought up again that next day and I again insisted Thata it's rude and also that my mum is not old.  A couple of days later I found out that, after they all jumped down my throat aggressively telling me how I'm ageist and that I'm being rude not them, M1 (the one who started this all)had said to my friend F1 that he would stop jokingly make fun of F1 if she were to agree with him that my mum is old. This means that even though they KNOW it's annoying me they still had this little agreement together KNOWING it will wind me up, to then get annoyed telling me I'm starting a fight (I didn't raise my voice or get angry,just defended my mum).

Keith used forearm crutches while I used a cane. Due to our conditions, we walked towards the back of our group. Neither of us had issues with this fact, however the teachers on this trip did. The second day of this trip, two teachers asked us to move to the front. The theory was that us walking in front would set the pace for the group. However, it instead made group members annoyed with us and did nothing. Multiple group members glared, muttering about it being unfair and it ended with everyone walking around us. The teachers started this by calling out, Hey slowpokes. After we shared our disdain for that they proceeded to call us, The ones with the third legs They also called us, Pace makers and Pace Setters Each time the group would move again, attention was brought to us as we were forced to the front. We tried to explain that this was not working out and was only causing more problems. Not only was the group annoyed with us, but we felt the need to walk faster, actively harming ourselves. The teachers refused to listen. Keith finally snapped at the teachers.They tried to force us to the front once more and we refused, saying it wasnt working. They stated that they didn't care if we didn't want the attention on us and to just move to the front. Keith snapped, yelling that it was not doing shit and they had no say over this matter. We were immediatley pulled aside. The teacher lectured us saying that we would not talk like that here but also that we are disabled and have to prove ourselves to the others and make them understand, ending with we are all on the same side. We both put our mobility aids away, but still ended up towards the back.Edit for clarity: We both have Eds and Pots which is why we use mobility aids. While we don't 'need' them to go places, without them we are both in immense pain and risk fainting. So we are able to walk short distances without mobility aids.",

        "selftext": "I have lived in a 5bedroom student housing unit with a shared kitchen for the last 3 years. When I moved in I brought a couple of things with me and also bought some new stuff (a dish rack, a really nice second-hand food processor, some plates and mugs and a several cake/bread tins). I have not kept the receipts for these things and never asked any of my roommates to reimburse me for anything but everything has been in the kitchen and available for anyone to use. I have also made sure not to throw away anything that I replaced so that I could take my things and put the old back when I eventually move out. However, the 4 other people who lived here when I moved in have since moved out and been replaced (the first about 2 years ago and the last 6 months ago). I will be moving out soon too and have therefor started to pack my stuff. After taking my things from the kitchen one of my roommates asked about it in our groupchat. I told the truth (that I have taken the things that are mine since I am moving) and several of my roommates got very upset. They either don't believe that the stuff is really mine or they think that it's silly of me to want to keep them since they are used and have been in the kitchen for long enough that they should belong to everyone. I don't want them to feel like I am stealing things but I don't really have any proof to give them. One of them tried to contact the roommate who recently moved out but they have not responded and I have no way to contact the other ex-roommates. So, AITA? Should I just leave everything? It isn't really about money since I'd say it's probably only $100 worth of stuff and I have a job whereas my roommates are all students, but I would like to keep my things. Are there any third options? Edit: Thank you to everyone who's commented, I think I might have just been stressed out bc of the move and overreacted to the situation. I feel much more secure in my decition to just take my stuff! To clarify something that's come up in several comments; there's a bunch of stuff in the kitchen that has been left by earlier tenents/might even have been put here by the student union that owns the place, so it isn't entierly clear if anything belongs to someone unless it's put in the very limited space (a singe shelf) that's been labled with our roomnumbers.",

        "selftext": "  Hi AITA Reddit, I have a bit of a problem kinda going on.. My name is Katherine, I'm F 18. I have high functioning autism and ADHD. My mom cooks certain things that make me sick and nauseous. Most of the times when I tell her I can't eat it she makes me eat it anyway and I end up throwing up later. I'm on a medication for my disorders. My meds will often make me lose my appetite or make my stomach hurt. The thing is that I don't come close to being a picky eater. For lunch my mom made some type of meatloaf with green beans and cheese. Just looking at it made me gag. Instead of understanding I just genuinely cannot eat that, she practically forcefed me and I've thrown up at least three times in the past two hours...I just ran away just a few hours ago. I still feel guilty asf. My mom didn't let me get therapy and controls me. Idk if I'm the asshole for not wanting to be around her and just run away.",

        "selftext": "long story short i (17f) have never liked being around my family. my mom and i argue constantly & she kicked me out about two weeks ago, told me she was going to change the locks and all (which tbh was a RELIEF). now she\u2019s begging me back saying how sorry she is and blah blah blah. my grandparents live right next door & they have custody of me since i was 8. they\u2019re all very toxic & we\u2019ve never had good relationships and recently everyone jumped on my back about how im never home.  i\u2019ve been living with my bf (17m) and his family for over a year and will occasionally go stay a few days with mine, but never more than 4 days as i genuinely can NOT handle being around them for any longer (sometimes not even that long).  i ended up having a talk with them and telling them straight up that i am growing up and making my own decisions & that i don\u2019t like being around them bc everything always has to be an argument and the only way they think they can get their point across is by screaming. there has been plenty of physical fights as well,, why would anyone want to be around this?? in the end they denied everything which only made me angrier but it\u2019s what they\u2019ve always done. my bf\u2019s family is the absolute polar opposite and since my first time being here i never wanted to go back to my family.  after our talk, they were obviously mad but said that if i didn\u2019t want to live with them i didn\u2019t have to (all on recording). it\u2019s been about 4 days since our talk and now they\u2019re blowing my phone up telling me it\u2019s time for me to come stay a few days. i\u2019m immediately pissed off because that\u2019s what i\u2019ve been doing for the last year and clearly it wasn\u2019t doing me any good, so why the hell would i want to start doing that again? not to mention i dont even have a room there. i\u2019ve tried to let them down gently every time but im about to explode. it\u2019s getting to the point where i cant stand to even see a text from them. i had planned to go visit for a few hours tomorrow but now i don\u2019t even want to do that. am i just being an asshole or am i justified?",
