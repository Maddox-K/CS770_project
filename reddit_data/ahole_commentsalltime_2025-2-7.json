        "selftext": "  I got invited to my fiance's family christmas celebratory dinner. It's my first christmas with them. I have always been picky about what I eat. Can't help it and it has to do with psychological factors, childhood, and personal likes and dislikes. Before accepting their invite I let FMIL know that I wouldn't be eating the traditional food at their celebration, and showed her a variety of dishes to choose from to accommodate me. She refused and told me to bring my own dish. I said if I had to bring my own dish when I'm a guest then I better stay at home then. We went back and forth and I insisted I wouldn't come if accommodations weren't being made. I just thought it was a simple request and FMIL could've agreed if she really wanted me there. My fiance agreed that I shhould bring my own dish but I didn't. When we arrived there and I saw that no accommodations were made I got up, go my things and walked out and went home. My FMIL and fiance were shocked. I got tons of calls and texts from them both and my fiance came home lashing out calling me selfish and spoiled to walk out like that over a dish that his mom didn't have to make for me. and, that it was my responsibilty to feed myself. How is it my responsibilty to feed myself when I'm a guest? Makes no sense to me. I told him this and he accused me of starting shit and ruining my first christmas with his family and disrespecting his mom.  Now he's continuelly saying I fucked up and should've sucked it up for the family's sake. ETA to clear few points: * For those saying I have no respect for my inlaws. I do, especially FMIL. I respect her but this is so far the biggest conflict we had. * I work long hours even on holidays so not much time to cook. * I wasn't asking for an elaborated dish or several dishes. Just one simple option.",

        "selftext": "I\u2019ve (M32) been with my girlfriend (F29) for over a year now. She\u2019s smart, funny, a bit quirky, and has a serious job with a good salary. We have a great time together and generally get along very well. The only thing is her choice in home \u2018decor\u2019 is bizarre, to put it frankly, and not something you think a normal, grown adult would be into.  Her apartment is definitely a reflection of herself and interests. Not in the best way though.  My girlfriend has wall dedicated to animation in one room of her apartment, like Futurama pieces and etchings of some weird triangle guy. Then there\u2019s the wall of framed preserved insects in another room. But not insects like butterflies or moths. Instead she displays tarantulas, beetles, and large stick insects. Her bathroom has a subtle theme of the ocean-pretty common. But instead of starfish or shells, she has a little anglerfish nightlight, a small vampiric squid painting, and then a framed diagram of what apparently is a Goblin Shark right by the toilet.  I would say a majority of her home decor and furnishings are okay. The apartment itself is very modern and sleek. It\u2019s just the random decor and juvenile-ish themes like cartoons, insects, and bizarre ocean creatures, is off putting. This is where I might be the AH. I avoid bringing people over to her place, especially people from my job, because of how juvenile it looks. Everyone\u2019s impressed when they see the high rise, but that quickly fades once you enter. The one time I brought a work colleague over they ended up telling me after that they found her insect wall terrifying. I work in finance and appearances and first impressions are important. My office will hold casual gatherings where we get together for a few drinks, good food, and we rotate hosts. And this time, it\u2019s my turn. The problem is my place is under some construction and not an ideal place to be right now, so I\u2019ve been staying with my girlfriend. My girlfriend suggested that we host my colleagues here since she has the space and thinks it\u2019ll be fun. I told her I planned on skipping my rotation and seeing if the next person would be okay with hosting early. She kept pressing on why I didn\u2019t want them over here, so I finally said it\u2019s because her home decor is strange and not something a grown woman would have, and also that her insect wall horrified the one colleague that did come over.  My girlfriend got mad and said at the end of the day, it\u2019s not my space and these things bring her joy. She also said that she is indeed an adult woman, which is exactly why her apartment is decorated in such a manner.  I love my girlfriend, I do. And it\u2019s okay to have different interests. But does an adult really need to decorate with them besides a few things here and there? I mean, my own mother asked if my girlfriend was autistic after she saw the entire apartment for the first time. So Reddit, AITA for telling my girlfriend her home decor is the reason I won\u2019t host a work gathering at her place?",

        "selftext": "This didn\u2019t happen yet but my whole family is fighting over this. I\u2019ll try to make this as short as possible.  My father passed away in December. He owned a classic car. I believe it\u2019s a 50s Chevy bel air. My son (17) is the only grandson he had. I have one sister who has 2 daughters, and I have 2 daughters along with my son. So there are 5 grandkids in total.  My dad was never much of a girls guy. He always got along with the boys more than the girls. Him and my son were very close. He has left the car to my son in his will. The rest of the grandkids got $4,000 each. The vehicle is valued at over $70,000.  My sister is LIVID, I am very unhappy as well. It\u2019s just blatantly unfair to his 4 other grandkids. I don\u2019t understand the legality of the situation because it was left to him but he is currently underage. The car is currently held at my moms house. I don\u2019t know how to force him to sell it, but I think that is what should happen and the money can be decided equally amongst the grandkids. The way it should be.  My son is very upset about this, he says grandpa left him the car so it\u2019s his car. I have money saved for his college, I am almost considering telling him that his college money will be divided up amongst his sisters and cousins if he refuses to sell the car.  AITA?",

        "selftext": "Hey all, I'm genuinely torn about this and need some clarity. Every year, our family has a reunion where different members host. This year, it's my younger sister's turn. She's been vegan for about 3 years and is quite passionate about it. We all respect her choices and make sure there are a good variety of vegan options whenever we have family gatherings. When she announced she'll be hosting, she also said that the entire menu would be vegan to align with her beliefs and that it's a chance for the family to try something different. Some family members were excited, but others, including many of the older folks, were pretty upset and felt like they were being forced into her lifestyle, even if just for one meal. I spoke to her privately and asked if she'd be open to including a few non-vegan dishes for those who aren't keen on a full vegan menu. She got quite defensive, saying this was her chance to showcase veganism and that for one meal, everyone can give it a go. I respect her beliefs, but I also think that forcing an entire family to adopt her choices, even if just for one meal, isn't fair. She's now upset with me for not being supportive and says I'm not respecting her choices. AITA? UPDATE:wow! lots of good thoughts! ,thought I would answer a couple questions here so they're not lost in the comments: 1. There is no set rota, the hosting goes to whoever wants to host most / hasn't hosted before, in this case she wanted to host2. We have managed to come to a compromise where people can bring their own food as long as it doesn't contain meat, which I think is fair.3. just for some more context, she works at a well known UK fast food place, so has no issues handling / preparing / serving meat, although I get that this can be different at home.",

        "selftext": "My husband has been working really hard the last two years to advance at his company and he finally got the promotion he's been after. I'm really, really proud of him. His parents are too and wanted to take us all out to dinner to celebrate. My husband absolutely loves prime rib and there's only one place in our area that serves it so he picked that restaurant. Thing is- I'm not fond of steak. I'll eat it but very rarely. I prefer chicken or fish. I looked up the menu before leaving and right now they have a limited menu. The place had only one fish entree and two chicken entrees, and none of them sounded good for various reasons. I suggested that he pick someplace else so everyone can eat. He refused citing that we rarely get to go to this place but go to other places in our area regularly which is true, but those places have lots of variety so everyone can eat. He suggested that I ask if they could prepare the fish or chicken without the marinades or sauces but I didn't want to be difficult for the kitchen staff. His next suggestion was that I order dessert while everyone else ate entrees and then when we were done, he would take me where I wanted so I could eat dinner while he and the kids ate dessert. So I opted to just not go because I didn't want to sit there not eating and not having a good time while everyone else was. My husband asked me to go so he could celebrate with the people most important to him. I told him no again and that he needed to get going before he was late. He did go but came back a little over an hour later with the kids and they all had to go boxes. He said he couldn't think of what to tell the kids about why I didn't go when they kept asking without lying or making me sound bad so he just got an order for them to go and let the kids spend some time with their grandparents talking in the parking lot. I told him he should had stayed but he said that I put him in a bad spot with the kids and that I knew he wanted everyone there and that I should've just gotten over my picky eating for one night. I maintain if he really wanted us to all eat dinner as a family then he should've picked a restaurant with a more accomodating menu. AITA? Update: Some of these comments were pretty harsh but a kick in the pants. I've apologized profusely to my husband and I am going to take him to that restaurant this weekend and buy him some camping gear he's been eying as a start to making it up to him and changing course.",

        "selftext": "My son just graduated high-school and we were paying so he could go on a road trip with his friends. He was suppose to go Wednesday , my wife\u2019s mother and father got in a car accident. They live in another state so we had to drive about 4 hours. My wife was a wreck and wasn\u2019t in the position to drive since we her dad was critical. He pulled through luckily.  We have two other kids 11 and 7. We can\u2019t leave them at home alone and we couldn\u2019t find a sitter to watch them on such short notice, we even tried our neighbors but he couldn\u2019t do it. So that left our 18 year old. He was pissed to put it mildly but did it. I told him we would make it up to him, and if he could ask if his friend could move it back a week. They couldn\u2019t sadly.  We were gone for two days, he pulled though. My wife stayed and I headed back, I payed him for watching the kids and went to talk to him about getting him on the trip. It was suppose to be two weeks and they should just be a state over. He blows up about ruining his trip and there is no point going even though it should still 12 days of the trip. He called up a jerk and lock himself in his room.  I need another opinion since this was emergency and he doesn\u2019t seem to care his grandparents almost passed.  Edit: Well he called his mom, let\u2019s say it didn\u2019t end well,  he did say basically said the same thing he said to me, wife had a breakdown on the phone with him, she sent him the injuries and pictures of grandpa/grandma. He finally came out of his room and told me he isn\u2019t going to go on the trip and the plan tickets aren\u2019t needed.  Talked to my wife, never heard her that mad. Son confirmed what happened, he started yelling at her the moment the call started and she lost her shit when he called her selfish. On good news grandpa has some feeling back in his legs which was a huge concern  For people saying we didn\u2019t have emergency plan we do, first my closest friend- vacation, main babysitter- not available, backup babysitter- not available, last resort grandparents- hospital.  We tried to find someone that why we even asked our neighbor which I have a good relationship with. This will be my last update, had a conversation with my son about everything. Mom and him will have a conversation when she is calms down. His friends are not a state over, they are about two down at this point and going to Mexico. They are probably will get to the boarder tonight, they were suppose to be going to California . He had his passport and everything ready. This is a fucking mess. I haven\u2019t informed my wife yet and will wait until she is calmer. I\u2019ll leave off with I hope none of you ever have to deal with a situation like this and please remember your parents are human",

        "selftext": "I (54M) have two children (23F and 21M) with my wife (52F). When the kids were young, my parents set up education funds for both of them, which was very generous of them. My wife and I always expected our kids to attend college and then graduate school, as we have done. I have a PhD, my wife has a master's. Because of this, we decided not to use the funds for our kids' undergrad degrees and did not tell them about the money. My daughter has always been more into the liberal arts, while my son is more of a STEM guy. My wife and I worried about her ability to find a job, but she insisted on studying music and film in college. She was accepted to some top schools and chose to attend a rather expensive one, but she had scholarships to cover almost all of her tuition. Everything else, plus living expenses, was her responsibility. She lived in a very small apartment shared with friends in a not-so-nice area far from campus, but she was fine and learned how to budget effectively. After graduating, she luckily found a job that doesn't pay extremely well but she enjoys, and scrapped the idea of grad school. My son decided to do engineering, and he also expressed that he had no interest in grad school. My wife and I were disappointed, but accepted it since at this point he is already all set up with a very good job when he completes school. Since he did not receive as many scholarships as his sister, we decided to use his education fund to cover his tuition and living expenses. He was able to get a large and nice apartment of his own close to the school, which is important since his classes are so demanding and he needs a comfortable space to work. My daughter was confused and asked how he could afford this, and he told her about the education fund. She called us and asked why she didn't have one, and we told her she did, we just didn't use it because we hoped she would attend grad school. She seemed hurt by this and asked if there was any way she could have the money now. We explained that there would be a fee to simply withdraw the money for non-education uses, and if we chose to do that it would belong to her grandparents so they could put it towards their own use. She's been quiet and short when answering our texts, and hasn't answered our calls at all since then. I know that it seems unfair to her, but it's not really her money in the first place and she's no longer in college. Plus, her brother only received it for educational purposes and it wouldn't be right for her to just have it to spend now. AITA? UPDATE: I understand the consensus is that my wife and I are the AH. I texted my daughter to ask if she wanted us to withdraw the money for her/what she wanted to do. This was her response: I don't care. Maybe they can transfer it to [other grandkid who is 5] if the fee is seriously too much. Idk about grad school I haven't thought about it much recently. If I do apply it wouldn't be for another couple years and I hadn't been counting on having any financial help in the first place so it really doesn't even matter. Thanks for asking tho. UPDATE 2: My wife and I are discussing our daughter's response and our next actions to resolve this situation. For context, my wife has always had a strained relationship with my daughter and did not approve of many of her life choices. She believes we should take our daughter's words at face value and assume she no longer wants the money. From some of the responses here, I fear that my daughter's response was out of resentment and I suggested taking out as much money as her brother was given so at least they received the same amount. She could use it responsibly towards rent, groceries, transportation, etc. or in some other way to further her career, so it would still be for educational purposes in a sense. My wife is standing firm in her opinion, and we will continue talking it through tomorrow.  Many have asked about where my parents stand on this. At this point, they are not mentally aware enough to really participate in the discussion. They did know about our grad school stipulation and thought it was fine. They also knew that we took out some money for our son once we were certain he was not pursuing an advanced degree, and were fine with that as well. They said it was our decision as parents what to do with our daughter's fund, and they would support whatever we decided for her. It wouldn't be useful to ask them what to do with it now, but I have always said that whatever is unused will go back to their care. I have tried to call my daughter with no luck, which is why I sent the text. Despite what many have said here, I hope this does not end our relationship. ",

I have a crush on her although she isn't exactly my type. Lately I feel like I've been getting vibes that she likes me back. Last week I won a raffle and have 2 tickets to see a famous singer perform next month in a nearby city. She also happens to like this singer so I asked her if she wanted to go with me as a date. I said I can book us a hotel room and we can spend the night together. She said she'd love to go, but only as friends. She says she's alright with us splitting a hotel room as long as it has two beds. She told me she doesn't feel ready to date anyone at the moment, and she doesn't do flings either, so unfortunately we can only be platonic friends. I said I'll think about it. I was quite hurt because honestly I don't have much experience with rejection, and I was annoyed that she turned me down.  Today, i asked my female coworker to go with me to the concert as a date. She immediately said yes and seemed quite excited about it although she admitted that she never listened to any of their songs. Still, I'm taking her out for drinks on Friday. But just now, the friend who I asked originally asked if we were still on for the concert. I told her honestly that I already asked another woman, and she seemed disappointed but dropped the subject. When I told my sister about what happened, she said I'm being really douchy. She says her friend is a huge fan of the singer and I should take her instead of my coworker who doesn't even like the band but only wants to go because she likes me. I said she can't understand because she's not a dude. Because let's me honest, if I had the choice between going out with a girl who only wants to be my friend versus a girl who is super into me and wants to take things to the next level, then obviously I'm taking the second one. AITA for just being honest about what I want? **EDIT**: Because a lot of the hang up is over the hotel room thing: YES I would have been fine if the first girl agreed to go with me as a date, but wanted separate hotel beds/rooms. Nowhere do I even say that we have to share a bed... But the part where she says she\u2019s not ready to date anyone essentially means she is not interested in me. She likely said she\u2019ll go with me as friends just to be nice and not hurt my feelings. So why would I make the experience awkward for the both of us when I could bring along someone who actually is interested in dating me? **EDIT OVER**",

It will be around 100-150 people total. My husband and I are paying for this all ourselves, as well as my grandma who said she doesn't care one way or the other on this issue. She just loves weddings. We have a lot of kids in our family so we decided against making it child-free but we did decide to make it dry. So there will be no alcohol of any kind at our wedding. Honestly, this doesn't have anything to do with there being kids there but due to the fact that my fianc\u00e9 and I don't drink. Nothing against people who do, it's just not for us and we don't want to. On top of that, we only really drink water. We rarely, if ever, drink soda so most of the time it's only water with the occasional juice and milk. We don't even drink coffee.  So obviously the food (which is a part my grandma is not paying for) is going to be expensive for that many people. We are having our wedding catered so everyone will have a good choice of food to choose from but to drink only water will be provided. We don't want to have to pay for alcohol or soda, it is just an large added expense when we can just do filtered water for a MUCH cheaper cost. Well, when family and friends found out being got angry. Some didn't really care but some are really upset about it. Saying that I can just have an open bar so I don't have to pay for drinks (we could, but still have to pay for the bartender and we just really don't want to bother with alcohol there). Or we should at least have soda because how can we expect everyone to drink ONLY water? The kids will be upset. The wedding will be boring. That this is not how weddings work. Etc. So AITA? I didn't think this would be a problem! It's only water. I mean, don't most people drink water everyday anyway? Should we pay the extra to have soda to make the family happy?",

        "selftext": "My 9yo son needed hip bone osteoma surgery and his mom and I scheduled it before his three week winter break. My ex and I share 50/50 but I get him on winter breaks so she could take him our of state to see her family in the summer. The day before the surgery she asked me if Ry could stay at her place to recover from the surgery. I asked her why and all she said was that she just wanted to be there. I said no. Ry has never had surgery and it's a big deal for him. I don't want him to think that the first thing you when you face something scary is run to your mom and not your dad. I told her I was quite insulted by her request. Plus he was going to need help getting dressed, undressed and bathed for the first couple of days and I highly doubt that he'd be comfortable having his mom do that. She said her husband could do that. I told her no. He's having the surgery and I'm taking him to my house when he's released. I don't care if she's in the operating room.  She then asked if she could see him at my place and I said no. The agreement is that we have scheduled FaceTime with him when he's at the other parent's house. I don't want my ex wife in my home anymore than she wants me in hers. If the shoe was on the other foot then I'd understand whether I liked it or not.  I held firm and things have been tense between us ever since. Personally I don't care because I'm not apologizing for not giving her what she wanted. Edit: No, my son doesn't get to decide who he gets to stay with and when and for how long. That's why there are custody agreements.",

        "selftext": "Throwaway because some of this made local news and I don't want it connecting back to me. I work in a place where we are not allowed to have personal electronics on us at all. No phones, no smart watches, no pagers. I've been working here for about 6 months so my wife knows this and understands that she should not try to contact me by my cell at work. Phones are dropped off in our lockers and I typically have mine on Do Not Disturb. Before this incident, my phone has never gone off in the locker before. Recently there was a pretty big fire at a secondary worksite that I do work at occasionally but that day I was working at the main building. Local news covered the fire before I found out about it because again no electronics, plus the work we do isolates us a bit so news travels pretty slowly. There were a few casualties, a lot of seriously injured folk.  My wife had been watching the news from home and started freaking out, I guess. She called me 20 freaking times, which (and I did not know this was possible) overrode my DND and my phone was ringing for a while in my locker. In the middle of my shift, I got called into my managers office and was chewed out (and written up) for my phone making so much noise. They told me to go take care of whatever it was making my phone go off before I went back to work. I won't lie...when I saw those 20 missed calls from my wife I was seriously pissed off. Like I said, she knows not to try to contact me directly and a citation hurt my chances of getting a raise or promotion. I called her back and she was sobbing and asking me if I was okay. I said of course I was okay and asked what the f*ck was wrong with her to call me so many times. She was still crying and started talking about the fire. After that I started half-yelling at her about all the reasons it was dumb of her to call me. When I got home she was super upset with me. I apologized for yelling but she refused to talk. She's been very chilly the past few days and sleeping in our daughter's room. I know it was not the best decision to yell at her but I still think my anger justified . 1) she knows I don't work in the secondary worksite very often. 2) she knows that I can't be contacted directly and she could have just called the office. 3) 20 calls is absolutely *insane*.

        "selftext": "So I know from experience that Reddit isn't the most understanding towards parents of young kids but I really just want a third party opinion because this situation is driving me crazy and my family are saying I need to get over it I (F30's) live with my partner and our two kids, ages 7 and 3. My older sister Ava (also F30's) and her husband recently purchased a house in the local area. It's a super nice place with a big yard and as you can probably guess from the title, a swimming pool. Ava recently hosted a barbecue at her place. It wasn't a huge event, she invited me, our parents and our other siblings. She mentioned letting the kids play in the pool so I only assumed my kids would get to be included We are potty training although my youngest is still in diapers at the moment. At the barbecue, I was getting my youngest ready for the pool by changing him into a swim diaper. Ava pulled me aside and told me she doesn't think it's hygienic for my youngest to play in the pool, since swim diapers don't hold pee and she asked that he doesn't swim in the pool with the other kids playing in it I didn't think this was fair and told Ava that lots of people, adults and kids, pee in the pool and it would be no different at a public pool so what's the problem? She was being really condescending and wouldn't listen to me at all and said that he can play in the pool when he's toilet trained, and said it's not fair on the other kids. At this point my son was crying because he wanted to swim in the pool and I told Ava she was being cold but it's her house and her pool so do what you want. Ava accused me of trying to guilt trip her and told me to just drop it. I was getting upset myself at this point and i told our parents and other siblings about what Ava did. They told me it's not a big deal and that it's not worth arguing with her over and try not to let it bother me. I wasn't happy with this because this essentially means they're siding with her and downplaying how she treated me and my son.  I left the barbecue early with my family because we didn't feel welcome after that. The next day Ava messaged me a whole paragraphs and said that she's sorry that I'm upset and that she wasn't trying to exclude my son for the sake of it. It was a super non-apology and I told her I don't want to hear it and that she's damaged her relationship with her nephew and shes not the one who had to deal with him being upset.  Ava snapped at me out of nowhere and said I'm being dramatic. I told her to grow up and said that I have a very valid reason to be mad, and she needs to stop acting like a teenager.  Ava showed these messages to everyone and everythings just a bit up in the air. I feel like I'm right here but the rest of my family doesn't seem to agree.",

        "selftext": "So, my daughter was born over 3 months early. She's doing ok but she still have periods where she Bradly desats (braddies) where she stops breathing, oxygen saturation drops in her body and goes bright blue. She does this at least once a day and because of this, she is still in the NICU with no current projection for when she's coming home. The only thing I can do to help her is to give her cuddles and provide her milk, which means expressing for 20 minutes minimum on each boob every 2 to 3 hours, including over night.  I have also had problems with flees in my home (they've been awful for everyone in my area this year), so I've torn up all carpets and thrown away my sofa and mattress, so I'm currently sleeping on the floor on a blow up mattress with my fianc\u00e9. This means that any noise that I make, no matter how much I try to minimise it, carries downstairs to my neighbour. I express milk over night, once at 11:30pm, 1am and then at 6:30am. My neighbour downstairs knocked on my door this morning and complained about my 1am alarm waking him up. I apologised and told him that I can't turn that specific alarm off because it's the expression that impacts my milk flow and doing that expression will prompt me to produce more milk over the day. I'm already under enough stress that my milk flow has already been impacted ( I was producing around 100ml and I'm down to 50 to 70 ml). I need the alarms because I cannot miss my expressions, I already feel guilty enough that I'm not producing as much as I was.  I explained all this to him and he still said that it wakes him up and that he can't sleep after it wakes him up. I again apologised and said to him that I can set my alarm between 1am and 3:30am, and he can choose from between those times. He said I should just turn the alarm off and I responded that I can't, because I can't afford to sleep through my expressions times. He then said that I should express after 5am, which isn't possible because the hormones that help produce more milk are at their peak at between 1am and 4am.  He complained about it waking him up again and I angrily responded that My daughter is premature, she needs my milk and I will do everything to make sure she's got as much as she needs, including waking you up at 1am because I need to express!  She is my priority, not your sleep. I closed the door in his face.  I just spoke to one of my friends and she's telling me that I'm the asshole because my daughter is eating every 3 hours and I'm making just enough milk every time for at least one meal for her, so it won't hurt to not express the 1am expression but it honestly IS the most important expression for milk production. So Reddit, AITA for not stopping expressing at 1am even though I know it wakes up my neighbour? ETA: many people have suggested I put the phone on vibrate, which would be a fantastic solution if it wasn't for the fact that I have slept straight through having injections or having a cannula put in (I was awoken long enough to give permission to have it put in). I'm open to solutions, but putting my phone on vibrate isn't going to work. Eta2: I gave him noise cancelling earplugs and explained the situation when I first came home from the hospital. We also pulled up the carpets 4 days before I went into labour, so it's not something that we could control, we have to leave the flea solution to work for 2 weeks and the firm has already been booked to have new flooring put in after that 2 weeks. Eta3: I've been asked to add this because it gives context to my neighbour's view regarding noise.He apparently needs absolute silence, noise or vibration doesn't seem to matter. He made a noise complaint when I moved in because I flushed my toilet at night and then again when my cat jumped down from her cat tree to get food or water at night. I've learned every squeaky floorboard in my home because if I stand on one and the squeak wakes him up, he'll scream and bang on the ceiling. This will be my last edit, I am no longer going to be reading comments here or via pm as there has been some pretty heinous messages sent to me. I get it Reddit I'm the asshole but to have people tell me my daughter should stop breathing and die is unacceptable and I have reported that specific message and blocked the user. This is quite enough internet for a while.",

He came home and was lashing out on everybody. Calling us selfish and unfeeling. I tried to explain that the kids were busy but he told me to get the f out with that bull because my older son could've skipped the hangout and watched his brother and, my daughter could've watched her brother while studying instead of locking herself in her room. He scolded me as well but I told him I couldn't leave lunch with my brother since he was visiting town and this was my only chance to meet his girlfriend. He yelled some more than told us that he was canceling the family holiday trip for christmas this year. The two older kids were upset and said it was unfair. I called him unreasonable to cancel the trip and punish the kids (and possibly me) like that. he refused to discuss it later. Now me and the kids aren't speaking to him and he's saying good riddance *edit My husband was supposed to watch our son at the time. That's why I went to see my brother at the restaurant. The kids aren't used to watching their brother when neither parent is home.* *update My husband just told us that he'll be spending christmas with his family saying he needs to be around his dad anyway. the kids said they will just go to their dad since they and my husband are still not talking. neither of the kids are happy with how things turned out. so I feel like things have gotten out of hand and the problem got bigger. He's now choosing to basically abandon us on christmas and also keep our son away from me and his siblings.*",

Our daughter has always been a little socially awkward to the point that we've had her tested since we suspected her of being on the spectrum. Turns out she isn't on the spectrum; she's just a natural introvert. However, this year in school we were thrilled when our daughter made a new friend her age since that is an area in which she struggles. Long story short she recently invited her new friend over (with our aproval) to have dinner at our house and then spend the night. So, my daughter's friend came over. My husband is usually the cook in the family and this night was no exception; he made us all a really nice meal. During the course of said meal I asked my daughter's friend; Are you enjoying the food? She responded Yes! [Your husband] is a great cook! No wonder you've ended up a bigger woman. The room got quiet for several moments. My husband tried to laugh it off and change the subject but I wasn't having it. The girl had just leveled a completely uncalled-for insult at me. My daughter's friend seemed to realize that she'd messed up but she didn't say anything else. We finished an awkward dinner in mostly silence and my daughter's friend did stay the night. This was a couple of months ago. Recently my daughter asked if she could have her friend back over and I told her Sure; if she's going to apologize to me. When our daughter asked what I meant I reminded her of what she'd said. My daughter responded that it was over and she didn't want to bring it up again. She then went to her father and asked. He said sure but she then told him what I'd said. He came to me and said: [Daughter's friend]  just felt awkward and tried to make a joke. It didn't land. For the sake of our daughter can't you just let it go? Yes, I could, but the thing is that I just want an apology from the girl. I need to see that she understands how rude she was before I can get on board with her and myy daughter hanging out. My husband says that I am being weird for insisting on an apology from a 14 year-old, especially since that girl is such a good friend of our daughter. I think it's weird that I'm still waiting for an apology from that same girl. Seriously. That's all I need. I just need to know that any friend of my daughter is willing to own up to her screw ups.",

My husband and I are more than happy to have them stay for few weeks til they get this resolved. However, Yesterday at 7pm, I was in the kitchen when my husband rushed in and said that he saw both my sister and her husband walk out of the bathroom. They'd most likely taken a shower together. My husband said that it irked him and I agreed that what they did was somewhat inappropriate. He asked me to speak to my sister on the matter and I did. She got defensive asking how this is affecting me or my husband in any way. I told her that it made my husband feel uncomfortable and would rather that they just take their showers seperately. She started ranting about being overwhelmed by their son's health problems and not having some alone time together as a married couple and found this activity as a bonding time to spend together. I apologized for how she felt but requested that she just do as asked. She got mad at me and said that I was being inconsiderate and she didn't understand my husband's hangup on what she and her husband do. We started arguing and she stormed off to the guests room where my nephew and BIL are. She's not speaking to me but my husband said I did the right thing by speaking to her and setting this boundary. AITA? Am I (and my husband) overreacted to this? Some infos: 1. My husband did not mention hearing anything, just that he saw them get out of the bathroom. And yes they were clothed. 2. It's the only bathroom in the house. 3. They spent apprximately 10+ in the shower according to my husband. EDIT* I'm gonna bring my husband to look at the responses and help answer some questions down here, okay? Just give me a few minutes. EDIT* I'm sorry I can't respond to every single comment but my husband says he's uncomfortable and doesn't want to expand on the situation.",

        "selftext": "My (34m) sister gave birth 2 months ago. She brought the baby to mine and my wife's (23f) wedding. She breastfeeds whenever she goes. We visit her house? She'll breastfeed in front of us. Visiting our parents? She'll breastfeed. Going out in a public setting? She'll sit on a bench on the park and breastfeed. Go out to a restaurant? She breastfeeds. Every where. I've never spoken on it because I know she'll get mad and offended but when she did that on my wedding I lost my cool. During the reception dinner she just did it again. I kindly approached her and asked her why she didn't bring formula or at least bump milk out and put it in the bottle so she wouldn't have to do all this at that moment. She said because I don't have to. I feel comfortable breastfeeding. Getting milk out on my own is more painful I said she could just make this sacrifice and compromise for one day instead of doing this in front of 250 guests on my wedding. She then said she can't do much about it now, because the baby has to have her milk. I told her she should be more thoughtful of that then instead of completely embarrassing herself and us by doing this. I told my wife what the deal was and she said I'm an AH and should immediately apologise to my sister. My parents also sided with my sister and now pretty much everyone thinks I'm an AH since I'm the only person who had a problem with it. The only reason I decided to call her out is because I considered it a bad etiquette and tacky to do that at a formal event and that she could just find another solution for that night. AITA?",

        "selftext": "I <30M> have a beautiful wife who loves to serve others. We bought a home down the street from my family. I have a sweet sister <17>Who likes to crash at our house with her friends.  My wife normally is pretty easy going until recently. My sisters friends have been leaving messes. Mostly towels on the floor after using our pool. My wife got upset picking up after them every day.  I have asked my sister to make sure the house is clean after they leave and it has been better. My wife also complained that some of her perfumes/Clothes personal items have gone missing.My sister said it\u2019s not her. I believe my sister. I just don\u2019t see her doing that. I told my wife and we agreed to just replace them. Last week my wife made a couple of pans of cinnamon rolls from scratch. One pan was for us, the second pan was for a co-workers family who is experiencing a tragedy.  My wife went to the gym. I went to work and my sister and her friends came by. The one pan wasn\u2019t enough for her and her friends.They wanted the second pan of cinnamon rolls and my sister texted my wife asking if they could eat them. My wife said no. They ate them anyways. My wife upset went and bought new locks. When I came home my wife handed me a new key and told me that she didn\u2019t want anyone else to have a key to our house. I tried to calm her down and tell her that I would just go replace the eaten cinnamon rolls with store bought ones. My wife decided this was her hill to die on and said no my sister lost the privilege to come when we are not home. Replacing stolen items wasn\u2019t \u201cgood enough\u201d anymore. My mom called and asked if my sister could use the pool as a back to school party? I was under the impression my mom would be there. I said yes, my mom was at work and our schedules clashed. The easiest solution was for me To change the locks back so they could come into the house. My mom didn\u2019t come with my sister. When my wife got home after the party. It was a mess. She sent me photos. She called me the A for changing the locks without talking to her about it. (Keep in mind she did too.) then told me I broke her trust. She wasn\u2019t safe in her home because she keeps getting robbed and I refuse to put an end to it. (I did talk to my sister). Then my wife let me know she was staying with a friend for awhile.  Am I the A here? I feel like I have tried to right any wrongs that have happened. Between my wife and my sister. Update* sorry I haven\u2019t been able to reply the past couple of hours. I have been busy. I talked to my mom again and let her know my sister isn\u2019t allowed over without me home.  I asked a friends wife who is a maid to come deep clean our home. So if/when my wife comes home it\u2019s clean. The last thing is my mom asked me to help cover my sisters cheer. She is on track for a scholarship. I told my mom I would pay half of my wife\u2019s things were returned. If not the money was going to replace the stolen items. Also my sister was invited to home coming. She wanted me to buy a dress. I told her no for not following our home rules and the money I saved for the dress is going to pay for the maid. I did replace the locks again. I also am planning a romantic dinner I will make and clean up. I heard a lot about the cinnamon rolls. Someone on here gave me the idea to make them. I am for a dessert. Update: my sister and my mom left a few mins ago. My sister had a bag of my wife\u2019s things. More than I thought was gone. Most items are in poor shape. The big thing is she had my wife\u2019s grandmothers ring I thought was in the safe. I had no idea it was gone. My sister said that she found it on my wife\u2019s night stand during the party. She forgot she had it on when she left our home. The ring isn\u2019t valuable it\u2019s just sentimental. I told my mom who the ring belonged to. My mom lost it. My sister is now grounded. Last update tonight, my wife is coming home. I am staying at a friends house. Until we can work some of this out. I already stated it but I did put the locks back on my wife bought. My family doesn\u2019t have that key. Early morning update, My mom called my wife last night and asked what my sister can do to fix/ replace the damaged items.My wife said \u201chave her meet me every morning at 5 am.\u201d I decided to tag along and see what my wife had planned. Trying to support her in whatever punishment she decides to do. You know the cinnamon rolls. My wife\u2019s co-works 4 yr old is in the final stages of cancer. My wife\u2019s plan is for my sister and her to prepare breakfast, get their other kids up and ready for the day. Start laundry, basic clean up. So her co-worker and his wife can spend as much time as he can with the sick child before work. My sister was silent the whole time coming back home.I can tell it really hit her that her life isn\u2019t as hard. Even being grounded. Last and final post, my wife has given me a second chance as long as I follow her list of rules.1) for awhile no family at our home2) no family borrowing our things. 3)no one is allowed a key4)I help with the chores around the house. Including cooking meals.5) last My wife is ok with me seeing my sister but asked that we all go to counseling to understand why my sister is targeting her. My wife said all of this has been really hard and she doesn\u2019t want to cause more issues but she just doesn\u2019t trust my sister and can\u2019t have her using out things.",

I then, as a joke, said at least she'll still be tight down there. My GF looked confused and then said that was a weird comment to make about her friend. I then said it is a very normal joke to make and she disagreed. TLDR there was some back and forth, i asked her to drop it and she kept trying to talk about it. I said to her youre so insecure and she then goes does it make you feel good to call me that? so then I got really frustrated, got up, and walked out of the restaurant and drove home. She called me several times (I drove both of us there) but I was so frustrated and just wanted to get home so I turned my phone off. She showed up at our apartment 30min later and was really pissed called me an asshole and over reacted, and that she waited in the cold for 20 min for an uber.

        "selftext": "My husband (39) and I have been married for 5 years. We have two children of our own, both girls, aged 5 and 2. I also have a son (10) from a previous marriage, but I was widowed. My husband's ex is barely involved in stepson's life at all. They got divorced when stepson was 2, and his ex wanted a fresh start so my husband did the decent selfless thing and had complete custody of their son, even though he'd wanted shared custody. I got a bonus at work and I really want to go on vacation with just MY family JUST once. We've been on family vacations all together lots of times. But just once I want to spend MY money going on vacation where I'm not looking after someone else's kid. I want stepson to stay with his mom while we go on vacation. My husband sees my point of view and is okay with it. I don't think I'm being at all unreasonable. My mom found out what I was planning and says I'm being a complete AH. These are the reasons she says I could be the AH: 1. My mom says that if stepson's mom isn't properly involved in his life, I should be even more involved in his life to compensate (I think this is a completely unfair expectation).2. She also says that I'm being a hypocrite taking my son, but I think that's totally different because my son DOESN'T HAVE ANOTHER PARENT. I'm all he's got. If stepson's mom won't take him just for once then obviously he'll come on vacation with us. But I don't think I'm the AH to ask if I can have a vacation with my own family just one time. It's not like I hate stepson or something, he's a nice kid, he's just not mine. Am I the AH? UPDATE: We definitely won't be going on vacation without stepson.\r  \r After a couple hours of replies, I decided to show this to my husband. We sat down and had a really long talk about it. He told me he's never been comfortable with my attitude to stepson, but didn't know how to say to me before.\r  \r  I don't want to be a bad person, I just never thought of stepchildren being yours. \rI don't think it would be easy for anyone to accept this level of criticism, but all your replies have shown me I have a LOT of work to do. As many of you suggested (and so did my husband) I intend to see a therapist to help me with that.\r As I said, I don't hate stepson in any way, I have never been deliberately cruel to him, I've just always thought of him as my husband's child. But I realize my mindset needs to change. \rSo I'm going to start working on that. I want my family to be the best it can be, and I need to accept that it includes my stepson. I understand that now, and I'm going to start seeing a therapist to become a better person (we've also talked about maybe having family therapy too). I've also made up with my mom, and she is 100% behind the changes I want to make in my life.\r  \r  It wasn't easy to hear everything you said, but I understand that I needed to hear it.",

        "selftext": "This happened last year but since it still gets brought up during arguments every now and then and I just discovered this Subreddit I decided to check what you guys think. Me and my wife have two children (15F & 11M). My wife is a stay at home mom since the birth of our second child. I (46M) work full time and earn a six figure salary. My job is highly stressful, requires me to travel a lot and mostly sleep in hotels. I only get to come home to my family on every second weekend, on average. Despite working a lot, I am glad to do it so that my family can live a comfortable life. Last year, I decided to buy my wife a Roomba for Christmas. My wife tends to be the one who vacuums the house so I presumed that she would like this present as it would free her of this chore. As she unpacked the present, she was heavily offended and did not hesitate to show it, which made the whole situation quite uncomfortable as my parents and other members of the family were also present. She argued that 'this should not be a present directed at her but at the whole family, as it is the entire family\u2019s responsibility to clean up the house'. Since I work and am the sole source of income in the family and she is a stay at home mother, I think it is apparent that she should take on responsibilities such as taking care of the kids and maintaining the house. The gift was intended to somewhat relieve her of this burden. I, personally, would have loved to have received a Christmas gift that would have somehow made it possible for me to spend less time working. As cheesy as it sounds, I think that time is one of the most precious gifts and that Roomba would have definitely bought some time for her - time that she could use to do whatever she pleased instead of vacuuming.  Unfortunately, one year later, this still often gets brought up during arguments, often coupled with her crying. So, AITA in this situation? EDIT: I should also add that I would have never gifted my wife a vacuum cleaner or anything along these lines. I saw the Roomba as a robot that would fully take over this task which is why I thought it was a good idea. EDIT #2: I asked her numerous times before Christmas last year what she would have liked to receive and she repeatedly told me that she does not want anything. I was left to guess and chose the most practical gift that I was certain she could be able to make use of.",

She\u2019s an author, she write and self published romance and erotica stories and novels and while not rich, she\u2019s able to make a living out of it.

        "selftext": " My wife is a grade A+ picky eater. It's bothersome to a certain degree but on holidays basically the shitshow begins. She'd refuse to eat certain meals and mom would take it personally...which results in a series of arguments between them. As a compromise this year, My wife offered to bring her own food to thanksgiving dinner. I was stunned I asked if she thought this through and she looked at me confused. I told her about how weird it'd be for her to bring her own food especially when she woudln't be sharing it with anybody else, and told her to think about how mom will react. She'd get very offended and upset. My wife said that it's not her problem and that she was just trying to make it work by bringing her own meal. I told her again that mom might not like nor even allow this. She blew up at me asking if I want her to either eat food she doesn't like or go hungry. I suggested she give my mom's food a chance but she said it wasn't about my mom's cooking, she just doesn't like certain foods. We had an argument and I ended up telling she could stay home this thanksgiving and have whatever meal she likes. She got quiet then lashed out on me calling me insensitive and negative to say this to her. I repeatedly asked her to calm down but she couldn't stop ranting about how I was basically willing to exclude her from a major event. She started cold shouldering me about it while at the same time guilting me saying I'm treating her poorly after she offered the perfect compromise. Update: And so, my wife has decided to go spend thankgiving with her family (who by the way live HOURS away, so this means unnecesary travel expenses) instead and basically ditch me for a whole week. Y'all happy now? Though I appreciate some insightful comments on the situation. Some others?.....not so much especially with those assumptions claiming that my wife has allergies, SHE DOES NOT! Y'all get that from? But anyway. S'all good now I guess though I'm not too thrilled with her decision. I feel like she's doing it to spite me or get me to cave in.",

        "selftext": "My GF and I got take out from an Indian restaurant we like and order from usually when our budget allows us. This place is really the only good Indian place anywhere near us  but it is very pricey, and so we try to keep our order small (1 entree for me, 1 entree for her, and a side of naan bread that we share). The thing is, the side of bread isnt very much, and the entree just isnt the same without it. So it seriously annoys me when she eats the bread without dipping it in her curry. Its such a waste of the little bread that we get. I told her this before but says its not my concern how she eats her food. Except it is my concern because she is wasting a SHARED side. Whatever, I let it go each time.  This time she didnt order curry like she usually does, she got biryani (rice and meat) so I was happy that I would get the bread to myself. While we were eating, she reaches over for the bread and eats a piece on its own. I got annoyed and moved the bread away from her and told her she doesnt need the bread  since she isnt eating a curry and doesnt need bread whereas I am eating a curry so I do need bread, also that her entree comes with rice and she can eat that. She got offended and ended up threatening not to pay her share for the food next time. She also called me a greedy asshole and took her food and ate the rest in our bedroom. My friends are split, one of them says I'm in the right and it's too much carbs for one meal for her to have bread and rice, but the  other friend essentially also called me a greedy asshole. Its been hours and she's ignoring me. AITA?",

This concerns my oldest, I'll refer to her as 'Zara' We don't normally do big parties in our family after double digits (and 18th/21st), but Zara has been going through a bit of a difficult time so we decided to throw her a surprise party. This was yesterday. It was a big family party and Zara was enjoying it. Then the cake was brought out, I have a lot of young nieces and nephews so naturally they wanted to stand up with Zara, and she had no issue. When she went to blow out the candles, my 5 year old niece blew most of them out before her. Everyone laughed it off, my youngest actually put 23 candles on the cake and there were still a few lit, so I told Zara to blow those out. She did, but she looked angry and started crying. She then walked off. After that it got quite awkward and my sister (niece's mom) got upset/embarrassed, that her daughter is a kid and didn't mean to do it, and she didn't think Zara would act like this. We all calmed her down that it's not their fault. I talked to Zara and told her she was being a selfish brat and making a scene, she's 23 getting mad about birthday candles. She was still upset, and my other kids are telling me I wasn't being fair with Zara.",

        "selftext": "I (28M) am an only child. When I was 12 my parents divorced when my dad found out my mom cheated on him. This was devastating to my dad. My parents were best friends and started dating when they were 17. I played sports and my dad was my coach so I had a much closer relationship to him then my mom. I was suppose to spend one week at my moms then the next week at my dads. But I would usually just lock myself in my room at my moms. Usually my dad would drop me off and I would get on my bike and ride the couple miles back to his house. My mom would ask me things and I would literally pretend like she didn\u2019t exist. It got so bad that lawyers got involved thinking my dad was turning me against my mom. My dad encouraged me to spend time with my mom, but I couldn\u2019t. My mom tried putting us in therapy but I would just sit there till the time was up not saying a word to her. Eventually my mom broke down and let me just live with my dad.  I haven\u2019t spoken a word to my mom in 15 years. She would show up to my games alone. Sometimes I would ask my dad to tell her to leave. Sometimes I didn\u2019t even notice she was there. She would try talking to me after and I would walk right past her. I cut her whole family off besides a few of my cousins that were around my age. She showed up to my high school graduation and I asked a couple teachers to remove her and they did. She never dated anyone else to my knowledge and was still attempting to reconcile with my dad a few years before he passed. Calling it the \u201cbiggest mistake of her life\u201d and begging my dad to forgive her. When my dad passed a couple years ago she tried to show up to the funeral and I met her outside to ask her to leave. My fianc\u00e9 Rachel was with me when I did this and my mom cried upon learning we were engaged (Rachel introduced herself as my fianc\u00e9). Saying she couldn\u2019t believe I hated her still this many years later.  So last week I received a letter from my mom with a large check inside. In the letter she said she couldn\u2019t live knowing she wouldn\u2019t be invited to her only child\u2019s wedding. That her whole family is hurt that I cut them off. And that she had been keeping tabs on me all these years through my cousins updates out of respect for me, but couldn\u2019t handle not being at the wedding. I ripped the check up and sent it back to the return address. She shouldn\u2019t have even known my address as I keep her blocked on all social media. I called up my cousins who admitted that since I was 14 they have been providing my mom with updates on me. Prom pics, college updates, engagement photos and they sent her my address. I was so mad that I told them they wouldn\u2019t be invited to the wedding anymore because I don\u2019t want my mom getting access to it. Rachel is saying I\u2019m going too far now and uninviting my cousins along with freezing out my moms whole family because of her actions is an AH move. AITA? Edit: the cheating was with a teammates dad. This was highly embarrassing for me and caused me to have to move towns. Caused me to loose friends.",

        "selftext": "So here's the deal. I (19M) smoke weed all day, every day. It's just a normal  part of my routine and I don't see anything wrong with it, and this is not something that I want to be judged on. My mom is completely against me smoking weed, and she's always telling me to stop.  I believe that cannabis is nature's medicine and that society is  oppressive to those who use it. It has helped me in so many ways and it upsets me that it's still stigmatized. My mom told me a few days ago that my uncle and younger cousins (4 and 6 years old) would be over around 3PM yesterday, and asked me to not smoke on that day. She always gets upset if she sees me smoking, so I didn't do it while she was home.  She went to the grocery store in the morning and I figured it would be okay to  blaze up in the living room with the windows open before my cousins showed up. Well as it turns out, my uncle and two cousins showed up early and walked in right as I was in the middle of smoking a joint and lounging on the couch in my underwear. It was a really embarrassing moment, and I'm sure my small cousins were shocked to see me like that. To make matters worse, they saw me coughing in a haze of smoke as they walked in. My uncle was upset and he screamed at me for smoking in front of the children and being irresponsible. He told me that I needed to grow up and start thinking  about the consequences of my actions. I could tell that he was really disappointed in me, and the whole situation made me really frustrated.  I know this was not a good situation and I regret that my cousins had to see me like that. But here's the thing: I don't think I did anything wrong. My mom told me the wrong arrival time, so how was I supposed to know that my cousins would be coming over early? And I don't see what the big deal is about smoking weed in my own home, as long as I'm not bothering anyone. If I had been told the correct time, this would have been avoided. **TL;DR:  I smoked weed in my living room while my mom was at the grocery store and my uncle and young cousins showed up early. My mom gave me the wrong arrival time and I don't think I did anything wrong by smoking weed in my own home.**",

My son and husband always turn up their noses at tofu or any other meat alternatives - they say it's just weird that it's made to resemble real meat, so it's really the concept and not the taste. There are no allergies. My family and I often make two versions of dinner - one meat, one real, and twice the amount of pots and pans. There is an equal distribution of cleaning and cooking in this house, thankfully. My daughters had a fun prank idea of making two pots of spaghetti sauce, under the pretense that one was meat (they were both the soy ground beef). The goal here was to see if their brother and father actually hated the meat and to see if we could maybe save some dishes and time (in the future). Everyone loved dinner, both husband and son finished their plates. This was when my youngest couldn't hold it in anymore and told them. They both got VERY upset about being fed something other than what they were told. Reddit, AITA?",

        "selftext": "My son is a 20 month old toddler, my wife is a stay-at-home mom, I work six days a week and I'm usually gone for twelve hours a day. I always check in on my son remotely via our nursery cam app and he's always awake in the mornings around 8:00. He has a great sleep routine. Our wind down time starts at the same time every evening, we clean up toys, read a book, when I lay him down he's still awake, he falls asleep on his own and sleeps all night for at least twelve hours. It's usually after 9:00 before I have a chance to check the camera, this morning when I checked it was 9:12 and some mornings are closer to 10:00. Every time I look though, he's awake in the dark and standing in his crib just waiting. When I see this, I immediately turn on the brightest night light the camera has and speak to him through the camera app. I always tell him good morning and I love him and he usually laughs and says Dada. Then I leave the app and call my wife to wake her up. I usually have to call three to four times and when she finally answers, it's obvious that she just woke up and only because I called. I tell her that our son is awake waiting for her and that she needs to get up to start their day. This morning while on the phone, I asked her if she was going to get him after using the bathroom and she said no, she was going to the kitchen to prepare their breakfast and THEN she'd get him. I asked her to get him after the bathroom so he could go to the kitchen with her and she flipped out. She told me it pisses her off that I call EVERY morning to tell her how to be a mom and that she has a routine. I retorted with well, your routine sucks because he's been awake for an hour and you'd still be asleep if I hadn't called. I just bothers me that he has to wait so long. He needs a diaper change, he's probably thirsty, hungry and just wants to play. Am I wrong though? Do I need to stop? Please be completely honest with your answers. Thanks!  **EDIT #1**  I was banned from commenting within the first hour because I violated a rule in a comment and that's why I wasn't responding to anyone. I'm a fairly new Reddit user in terms of posting - I normally read a lot and that's all - and because of this, I had no clue that a temporary comment ban didn't affect my ability to edit the post. I would have edited the post much sooner had I known I was able to regardless of the comment ban. There are so many things that need to be addressed about this post and the most important one is about my wife. I love her more than anyone on Reddit thinks I do. She is an amazing woman and a wonderful mother. I absolutely DO NOT think she is an incompetent parent nor do I think she neglects my son. None of the information I provided was ever supposed to convey that negative message about her. My whole issue was: he's awake, he's been awake, why are you still asleep? - that's all, and she agreed she stays up too late plus has alarms set now. I showed my wife how this post EXPLODED and she COULD NOT believe the kind of attention it got. She is very much in love with me and does not agree that I am controlling nor does she believe that I am micromanaging her daily life. Also, because so many people believe that I intentionally left out the medical issues she has, I'll list them here: - postpartum depression- low vitamin B-12- chronic fatigue Now, let me explain why I didn't list them originally. Her low vitamin B-12 is not a deficiency, her level is just lower than what is considered best for her age; this is according to recent bloodwork that I recommended. The results state that any number between 100 pg/mL and 914 pg/mL is within normal range, and her level is 253 pg/mL. The doctor suggested sublingual B-12 1000mcg daily to raise the level a little, but stated that apart from that, she could not find a reason for the chronic fatigue. Because of these results, and especially after purchasing the supplements, in my mind, the B-12 is not a problem. Also, the bloodwork confirmed that everything else was normal. The postpartum depression is actively being monitored and treated by a professional. My wife literally goes to a psychiatrist, or psychologist (I can't remember their exact title) multiple times a year and we pay for medication every 30 days. She initially tried depression medication, followed the regimen religiously and not much changed for her. This was addressed in a following appointment and a new medication was prescribed. Her current medication is normally used to treat ADHD or narcolepsy and the doctor believed it would alleviate some of her tiredness and release more dopamine thus providing more energy in her daily life. This does seem to be true and she seems to be happy with the medicine. The chronic fatigue is a result of her own poor scheduling and personal health. She has agreed that she spends too much time sitting and using the phone. She naps when our son naps and has trouble falling asleep at a normal bedtime hour due to this daytime sleep. We always go to bed together and he's told me multiple times that she moved to the living room after I fell asleep because she couldn't sleep and was bored just lying there. Then, midnight or later comes, she's finally drowsy and decides to sleep. However, the overstimulation from social media and phone usage makes it difficult for her brain to reach REM sleep normally. So she falls asleep at 12:00, our son wakes up at 8:00, eight hours have passed and she still feels tired and not at all rested. I do know and have known about her condition. We have agreed to disagree about the cause of her sleeping problems. In her mind she has chronic fatigue because of insomnia and it's a vicious cycle. In my mind she stays up too late on the phone and doesn't get the sleep her body needs. Whether the internet thinks she is a bad mother, negligent, lazy or abusive is not important. I know and love the woman I married, I do feel comfortable leaving her with our kid and she does an amazing job with him. In a few comments I stated that she was lazy and didn't do much at home. I won't deny those statements, but in the moment I was still aggravated because the argument over the phone had just recently ended. I don't truly think she's lazy because I've seen what she can do; I just think she's unmotivated due to a lack of sleep and the same four walls every day. Finally, I am not spying on her or my son. We only have two cameras in this house and both are in our son's room. One camera provides a wide-angle view of the entire room and the other is positioned directly above his crib. The cameras serve no purpose during the day because I'd barely be able to hear background noise from another room even if I did try to listen in. My wife is an amazing woman and an amazing mother. My son is just so happy all the time, he's super smart, full of energy and extremely healthy. I will not be hiring a nanny or using a daycare. There is absolutely nothing wrong with what my wife does during the day, I just wish she'd start her day earlier for my little man. I want to say thank you to everyone who commented on this post and messaged me. My wife and I had a long, in-depth conversation last night after all of the attention this post received and I've shown her everything. There were tears, much more laughs and a lot of things to think about. I think the most important thing we learned is that so many people are quick to judge and that in itself is a very big problem.  **EDIT #2**  I need to make it clear that my wife does not have narcolepsy. She is not taking medicine for narcolepsy. I said that the medicine she takes now is USUALLY used to treat narcolepsy or ADHD. She also does not have ADHD. The second thing we learned is that people love to add details and change the story.",

        "selftext": "For the past week, my wife and I had been anticipating a baseball game for which we had purchased tickets. We like baseball, but we don't attend many games, so traveling into the city to see games is a rare treat. I know, though, that it would take time to drive there and find parking, due to traffic. Because the game started at 7 PM, and we live about 45 minutes from the stadium, I told her this morning that she needed to be ready to get in the car and go by 6 PM.  Well, my wife is an avid gamer, so she was engrossed in her latest video game when the clock struck 5:45 PM. She has struggled to plan in the past, and I get tired of reminding her that she needs to budget time to get ready. It's as if she has no concept of time at all, similar to a young child. Well, I was ready to go by 6 PM, and she was in the bathroom. I saw this as an opportunity to teach her personal responsibility, so I simply left the house without saying a word, got in the car, and started driving to the game. It took my wife a few minutes to figure out what I had done, but when she called me, she was absolutely furious. She said that it was a completely unacceptable move for me to leave without telling her and that she now had no way to get to the game without paying for parking. I told her that I got tired of constantly waiting for her and that she would plan better next time if she didn't want to get left behind. I also reminded her that I had told her that morning when I expected her to be ready to leave. Absolutely none of this seemed to matter, though, and she rudely hung up on me after yelling out more insults. Frankly, I think it's completely insane that a grown woman is unable to budget her time, and I'm starting to suspect that she is doing this on purpose because she's a narcissist who expects me to accommodate her. After all, she's not a dumb woman. She has a science degree. Well, she never showed up to the stadium, and I didn't hear from her the whole game, but when I got home, there was a note on the door. She told me that I wasn't welcome in the bedroom and that I should sleep on the couch. I can't believe she wants to be this much of a pill. If I had waited for her, I would have missed the first pitch. I made my expectations clear, and she couldn't be bothered to meet them. I feel like she should be apologizing to me. AITA?",

        "selftext": "throwaway for privacy.  My wife (23) and I (27) are expexting. She's due this month and things have been bit intense recently with her being extra hormonal. We live in different state then my family. My wife and I couldn't visit for Christmas. my parents were calling to continue complaining about us not spending Christmas with them and demanded I make it up for them. I said I was open for any suggestions they had and they suggested they come stay with us for a week once the baby is born. That way they could spend time with us and the baby as well. I thought why not that seemed to be a pretty good suggestion since it's been months since we've seen each others so I told them to go ahead and made the invitation Official. This morning my wife was talking about her plans once the baby is here and that's when I remembered my conversation with my parents. I immediately told her that I agreed to let them over for a week once the baby is born to make up for the holiday we missed with them. She first looked shocked then freaked out at me saying I shouldn't have invited them just like that without talking to her first. I asked why not since she loves them and loves being around them but she explained that my family can be a lot of work and having them as guests while caretaking for a newborn is the last thing she wanted. I told her it was no big deal besides that we could use help if she thought about this way but she lashed out on me about how the first few days of the baby's life is essential time for bonding and being intimate and I just took that away from her by inviting my parents and invading her space. I argued that she was being melodramatic right then because my family are decent people and I'm pretty sure they'll make this experience a lot more warmer but she still disagreed and said if my family were decent then they wouldn't have accepted my invitation but I clarified to her that I did NOT invitem and this was in fact a suggested made by them and I just agreed AFTER they complained about me missing spending the holidays with them. She went off on me demanding I call them and cancel everything I planned with them but I thought that was unacceptable since she gave not a good-enough reason for me to do that and besides my parents can help but she still denied that being true. She's gone radio silence for the rest of the day and is acting like my family are somehow making her uncomfortable though they're not the judgemental or intrusive type and are just about spending time with each others. AITA? Hold on! #Edit few things so there's no misunderstanding here. Alright? First of all my wife doesn't normally have an issue with my family being around, they all get along pretty good. and second of all which is an important info my wife and I talked about having her directly speak to them about why she would rather postpone their visit so we could clear the air but she refused and said she doesn't want to ruin her relationship with them and asked me to do it (tell them not to come) but since my family are upset with me then me telling them not to come might be taken in an offensive way, you know what I'm saying? so it really feels like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place. also, to all the people saying that my wife shouldn't be hosting guests. I don't recall mentioning this nor expecting her to do anything for the family. matter of fact I really thought we could maybe use their help especially my mom.",

        "selftext": " My husband, Mike (37) is the eldest in his family. He's pretty close with his sister Beth, (28) and they spend almost all week together. Beth had issues with her father growing up. She went no contact with him after he took her first car and damaged it. She only remained in contact with Mike since everybody else judged her for going no contact. She's getting married to her fiance of 3 years. From what I understand, she and her dad are slowly getting reconciled, but she made it clear she wants him to take no part in the wedding. She asked Mike if he could walk her down the aisle and he agreed. I have to say that I was taken aback and it felt a bit odd for me because, her dad is alive, they're on speaking terms again, he's gonna be there at the wedding so the logical thing to do is have him walk her down the aisle. This role isn't for her older brother but her father. Not to mention how FIL will feel about it. I brought this up with Beth and she had an attitude and implied that I was just saying this and objecting because of how I feel about the situation not how our traditions should be practiced. We got into an argument and I went home. Mike thinks I'm being unreasonable and possibly causing him to miss something so sentimental and that if anything, he feels honored to be asked to do this for her, and said that I should stop worrying about what others might say. Now we're having this conflict (3 of us) and can not seem to reach a solution.",

        "selftext": "UPDATE: I officially submitted the paperwork to John to get payment for the debt. However I decided that would forgive 1/4th of the debt.  So instead of claiming $37K, I am claiming $27,750.00.  I told my siblings that I would forgive a fourth - and if keeping the house for Sara is important to them then they each need to come up with the same.  So far they are saying they will not contribute.  John and I spoke with the lawyer and we were wrong about how any cash from the sale of the house would be dispersed.  First - any liquid assets have to be used to cover debts.  Then if assets need to be liquidated, then whoever was supposed to get that asset gets whatever proceeds are left after paying debts. So no matter what my siblings do - Sara will get the rest of the money if the house is sold.  The lawyer also pointed out the same thing many people here did - that giving Sara the money could affect her benefits.  Instead he suggested she turn down the inheritance in favor of placing the money into a special needs trust for her son. Sara will be talking to the lawyer on her options and exactly what that means. Sara is attempting to get a loan using the house as collateral.  Not all the paperwork is in order yet (exactly how much will be left in the estate after all debts are paid) - and we are probably looking at needing to get a professional appraisal of the home first.  One person at the bank talked to her and said that with her credit score and income she doubts she would be approved - but that she would process the application once Sara got all the data.   ORIGINAL POST: My mother died about 2 months ago. She didn\u2019t leave behind much other than a paid for house (worth about $180K) and a little money in the bank. Mom announced a couple of years ago that she intended to leave her house to my sister Sara who takes care of her severely disabled son full-time.  Mom said that she wanted to make sure they had a roof over their heads and the rest of her kids could make it on their own.  Sara does struggle a lot and has said many times that she wouldn\u2019t have been able to make it without Mom. When Mom died she had some bills outstanding, but her biggest debt was that she owed me $37K. I had loaned her the money so that she could fix her plumbing and septic system, as well as making the house more handicapped friendly for Sara and Jeremy. Mom had been paying me back every month. I have paperwork proving the money is owed. Here is the problem. If I file a claim against her estate like any other creditor would do, my brother John (Mom\u2019s executor) will have no choice but to pay it. But to do so \u2013 he will have to sell the house since there isn\u2019t money in the estate to pay it any other way. Which means that Sara and Jeremy will have to find a different place to live.  I know Mom wanted Sara to have the house. There is also the issue that Mom\u2019s will said Sara got the house, but any money in the estate would be split evenly between the other 4 of us. So technically we think that means Sara wouldn\u2019t actually get anything (John is talking to a lawyer to make sure he is reading that right). Sara is also concerned that if she did get a large amount of money (John and I have both said we would give her whatever we got from the house if it does get sold) \u2013 that it could interfere with the help she gets from the government. John and Sara are both pushing me to not file a claim against the estate. But if I don\u2019t \u2013 then the loan basically goes away. Sara has said that she will pay it back to me and would even sign a new loan. The trouble is that I don\u2019t believe her. She has borrowed money before and never paid it back \u2013 not because she doesn\u2019t want to, but because she can\u2019t afford to. She struggled with money living with Mom \u2013 so it is going to be even worse for her without Mom paying bills in the house as well. If I don\u2019t file a claim \u2013 I will be out $37K \u2013 and that is far more than I want to hand over as a gift \u2013 even to my sister. I\u2019ve told John and Sara that I am officially filing a claim on Monday morning. They are both calling me a greedy asshole and telling me that I am ignoring what Mom wanted. I think it's unreasonable to expect me to just forget $37K.  AITA?",

        "selftext": "My husband and I have been trying for pregnancy for years now, and to cut a long story short it seems as though it will never be a possibility. It took a long time to come to terms with but we've gradually got there. Our entire family is aware of the journey we've been on and how much it meant to us. With that in mind, my husband and I came to his sister (Sarah) with a proposal. Sarah is in her early 30s, unmarried, and vocally against having children of her own. Despite this we thought she might be open to the idea of a surrogate pregnancy on our behalf given she would not have to be involved in raising the child personally. My husband is extremely close to his family and the idea of the entire process of surrogacy being contained to his blood felt extremely important to him. With that closeness in mind, we did not feel it was out of order to ask this sort of question. We invited Sarah over for dinner and at the end of it laid out our request. We told her we had been saving over the years and would be willing to pay her as much as a regular surrogate would be paid (a pretty hefty fee so she would be able to take time off from work if it was required), help her out with everything she needed, plus we had no expectations that she must help raise the child just because she carried it. We told her why it was important to us and how much it'd mean, and asked her to have an open mind about it. Sarah exploded at us. She said we were both out of our minds for making such a request, extremely selfish, and that we had no respect for her disinterest in children. She actually left early. Right now she's refusing to take calls from us and even went as far as to ask my husbands parents to tell us to both not contact her until she decides to initiate it herself. My husbands parents are sympathetic to us but say that we should have kept in mind Sarah's difficulties. My parents think she is behaving awfully. Most of my friends are on my side but a few have said that it was a bit of a rude request given everyone knows how much Sarah hates kids. It's really weighing on my mind and I honestly never expected this kind of outcome. She literally blocked us on every platform she could. Are we really the ones behaving like an asshole?",

I'm of course happy to help and do my fair share for the kids or household, but it's never enough because her standards are too damn high.  She insists one of us has to be up at 6:45 every morning to make sure the kids are ready and make the bus which comes at 7:45. I told her they're old enough to not need that much help already. They can all dress themselves and pour themselves cereal and milk, there's no reason we have to be up. She says that cereal isn't a good enough breakfast, they need something more substantial, especially the 12 year old, and that the 10 year old has adhd and will definitely struggle without help in the morning and anyway she wants to see them off and kiss them goodbye for the day. So she gets up, I don't, then she gets upset that I never give her a morning off when all she needs to do is just take the morning off when she wants and let the kids handle themselves.  Also she is super strict about screen time during the week and is exhausted and snappy from arguing about it with the kids and upset i don't support her strict limit of 2 hours a day. I say as long as homework is done, why not until bed. She says it's not healthy for them, they need to play outside or with games and toys, read some books, just entertain themselves in more ways than 1. I agree they should enjoy other things but not seeing why we have to make such a rigid limit. She also likes to get out on weekends and do stuff like zoos, museums etc, but then complains about the planning for the outing and how grouchy the youngest gets by the end of it, and again, I say let's just chill at home and voila, you've cut the work!  I'm an engaged and active parent, I'm not trying to get out of it, but I don't think I should have to help my wife dig herself out of her own self created holes. She creates the stress for herself and then turns to me to alleviate it which I think is unfair. AITA for telling her she needs to do less and then she won't need this level of help?",

We're mostly in agreement about everything except, I've been kind of having an issue with what she wears especially at nighttime when she unwind and tend to relax a bit as she says. I think that what she wears is inappropriate. She usually wear silky nightwear (nightgowns mostly). She says that's just her style and is what she's been wearing for years. Not just that, but she'd come out of her room dressing like that to grab water or use the bathroom. While yes, it was just me who saw her dressed like that I honestly could not risk having an argument with my husband over it. I suggested she buys some pjs but she said that she doesn't feel comfortable in them. Last night, I saw her in the kitchen grabbing something from the fridge and was dressed in a purple, strapped, knee length nightgown. I tried to speak to her about it but it didn't go well. We started arguing and I ended up telling her to stop leaving her room when she's wearing stuff like that and she argued that there was nothing wrong with what she was wearing, that it wasn't like she was walking around naked or anything of the sort. I told her it's my home and she's a guest and should just respect my request but she responded saying that just because she lives in my house does not mean that I have the right to control what she wears then stormed off to her room. We haven't talked since then and she is refusing to talk about it. Edit: I wanna post a pic of the nightgown but don't know how. I'll see what I can do. Edit: here's the dress. It's not identical but close to what she was wearing, very close.  https://ae01.alicdn.com/kf/HTB1qKAoff2H8KJjy0Fcq6yDlFXav/3-Colors-Adult-Women-Claret-Black-Night-Gown-Ladies-Spring-Autumn-Lace-Silk-Sleep-Dress-Knee.jpg_Q90.jpg_.webp  Look at it and give judgement.

When my DIL was pregnant, I suggested that I host a welcoming party for my grandson right after she get discharged from the hospital. I've made arrangements and even emptied a room for them to stay but for some reason, she was against it and said she'd rather spend the first few weeks at home with her newborn. not only that but she said no to the welcoming party. My husband and I talked to my son and he said we'll see. But just a couple a days ago, We found out that my daughter in law had given birth 2 weeks ago and no one knew about it. My nephew told me and I immediately called my son, he confirmed it. he and his wife lied then hid the date of birth from the family. I told him this was not acceptable, lying just because they didn't want a welcoming party and love and support being given from family. I told him I was disappointed because for one...he ruined our welcoming for our grandbaby and also, I invited family members and they're all rightfully disappointed as well. He said it was his last resort after I kept pushing and made his wife uncomfortable but that was not appreciated because.. we were just trying to celebrate the new family member in a proper manner. We had an argument and he ended the call upon saying I ruined his joy for his newborn. My husband started texting him since he stopped replying to our phonecalls and now is threatening to block my nephew for tattling but I think that my nephew was decent enough to inform the family. otherwise God knows how long my son and his wife were going to hide their son just to keep us at arms length. We've always been kind and welcoming to my daughter in law and ger family, I don't why she would do this and disrespect the family like that. on the other hand, some family members see it as a justified action because we insisted on the party. Ps: Some folks, I'd appreciate it if you leave my nephew (m24) out of this conflict because he's not part of it.",

Issues began to arise between Dahlia and mom and I had to ask my friend, Anthony (M31) to let us move in til I get enough money to rent out. His wife was away visiting family and he agreed but even there, some issues started to arise. Fyi, Dahlia is very shy around Anthony. She grew up in conservative home and so it's understandable, but sometimes it can be a bit much I admit that!  For example, she freaked out when she accidently drank from his glass, she also once made a fuss when he passed by the guests room when she was lying down and the door was open. Thankfully, Anthony was super understanding and we were able to talk some of these issues out. Last night, Dahlia was passing the hall and noticed a framed picture of Anthony and his wife kissing hanging on the wall. She told me about it and said it made her uncomfortable. She asked if I could speak to Anthony about it but he didn't take it well. He gave me a look when I spoke to him and said this was bonkers because first of all, his wife put it there. And second of all, the picture holds sentimental meaning to him and his wife and argued that it wasn't some explicit picture of them, just a normal wedding kiss. We started arguing and he said that it wasn't like it was hanging in the living room wall or a perfectly lit room. I asked him to be a little more considerate because it's not like I asked him to remove it completely, just move it elsewhere that Dahlia won't reach or keep it off the wall til we leave. He said he was sorry but still refused. I explained how Dahlia was feeling but he said that again, he was sorry but would not move the picture. We argued some more and he said that it's his house and that I was being pushy and kind of too comfortable to make such demand and be pushy still. This morning, Dahlia refused to even come out of the room until the picture is moved. Anthony is refusing which makes it worse. Now I feel like I'm getting stuck between a rock and a hard place. Yes she might just be over reacting but I feel like this isn't such a big ask for Anthony to decline and turn down. fwiw If it were me, I'd go the extra mile to make sure my guests are comfortable. Anthony has been a friend of mine for 10 years. I wouldn't have asked to move in with him if I didn't have such strong bond with him. He himself constantly talks about all the things and situations I helped him out with and we are considered brothers.",

I have full custody and her mom is not involved in her life.  5 years ago I married my wife Nina(F31) we tried to have a child but couldn't. We went to the doctor and turned out I can't have anymore kids due to some complications. We decided to use an sperm donor and the result was a son, Mark, who was born a few months ago.  The problems started when Nina got pregnant. Harper wasn't happy about it. When Mark was born things got worse. Before this Harper and I used to spend 2 days a week together, just the 2 of us without my wife but after Mark was born I couldn't do that anymore. I can't just leave my wife alone for 2 days a week with a newborn and Harper has been very angry about it.  The main problem started 3 days ago. Nina and I decided to make a nursery for Mark instead of having him in our bedroom for multiple reasons.  Our home has 4 bedrooms, 2 master bedrooms at one side and 2 bedrooms at the other side. One of the master rooms is ours, the other one is Harpers. It was very hard for Nina and I to go to the other side of the home multiple times at night when Mark wakes up so I asked Harper pack her stuff and go to one of the bedrooms so that we could give her room to Mark. At first everything seemed alright. She said ok and went to her room and started packing but less than an hour later my brother showed up at our home, asking for Harper. She had called him and asked him to take her. She came out of her room with her stuff, told me you can give it to your son now and left with my brother. I told her she could only go for one night but it has been 3 days and she is not back and wont even talk to me.  Im receiving calls from my family all calling me an AH and other names.  I dont trust their judgement, they very clearly favor Harper. She was the first grandchild in our family and everyone's favorite also they are trying to accept Mark as my son but I could see that they haven't been able yet so I decided to post here and get some unbiased opinions. AITA? Edit: Here is the update that I promised  I realized I've messed up so I went to my brothers home and tried to get Harper back but he didn't even let me see her, saying she doesn't want to see me.  He said he would only let her go back if:  1. She wanted to go with me  2. We move to another home close to their home because they wanted to have Harper close to them to keep an eye on her and make sure we are treating her right, we used to live very close to them but when I got married my wife and family didn't get along so we moved somewhere farther away which made Harper very sad.  3. Harper will get to choose which bedroom she wants in our new home  4. I should spend 1 on 1 time with Harper at least one day a week  Which I accepted.  This caused a lot of problems since my wife doesn't like some of those conditions. she thinks they are not reasonable. She got angry, took Mark and went to her parents home and is staying there so now I'm also receiving texts from my inlaws calling me an AH.  Right now Im looking for a new home that is closer to my brother's home  I called Harper and my brother convinced her to talk to me for once. she was crying the whole time while telling me that she felt like I didn't want her anymore. Hearing her cry like that really broke my heart. I honestly never meant to hurt her.  After so many apologies and gifts she finally agreed to see me. I will go to my brother's home everyday to spend time with Her. She has also finally agreed to come home with me when I find a new home.",

My GF has beautiful hair that seems a lot more low maintenance than most women I know. She doesn\u2019t use all a hundred different hair products, nor does she blow dry it. It honestly doesn\u2019t take her long to style her hair or anything. However, she always insist on using this special towel to dry her hair.  She insists that she can\u2019t use any regular towel for her hair. She gets mad if I use her hair towel as a regular towel too. She says that the towel should only be used for hair. She even bought an extra one of these towels that she keeps in her drawer at my place. She also takes the towel with her when she goes on vacation.  I usually don\u2019t mind it, since the towel doesn\u2019t take up much space, and it better than listening to a hair dryer all the time. But it\u2019s a bit weird because I don\u2019t know anyone else who has a towel just for their hair.  For Thanksgiving, we travelled to see my family. Before the trip, I asked my GF to leave her towel at home since we\u2019ll be staying at my parents\u2019 house. I didn\u2019t want my family to think she was weird or make fun of her.  Since we planned to leave early in the morning, GF spent the night at my place. I noticed that she packed the towel she kept at my place in her suitcase. When she was asleep, I took the towel out. She didn\u2019t notice the towel was gone until after we got to my parent\u2019s house.  I thought it was okay, and my GF didn\u2019t seem mad at all during the whole trip. However, when we got back at my place, my GF got into her car and drove off without saying goodbye. She texted me later saying she\u2019s mad at me because of that stupid towel and she needs some space. I keep calling and texting her, but she won\u2019t respond.  My friends think she\u2019s being overly dramatic, but my GF isn\u2019t that type of person. Now I\u2019m wondering if I messed up. AITA",

I was in a higher end department store today (rhymes with loomingtales) and happened to end up next to two teenage aged girls while shopping. One of the girls had picked out a pair of VERY expensive boots and they were both fawning over them. Second girl must have looked at price tag and asks boots girl if she\u2019s really gonna spend that much on boots. Girl with boots says something along the lines of \u201cit\u2019s fine I have my dads credit card I\u2019m not paying \u201d which instantly caught my attention because THATS NOT HER CARD. I\u2019ve told my son multiple times he\u2019s never allowed to use my card so I\u2019m interested to see how this girl thinks she\u2019s going to get away with fraud but had split up from the girls at this point because they had found something else. We end up at the same register (me behind) and I see her total hit well over four digits. The girl is about to swipe her card when I decide that I can\u2019t let her get away with something like this and someone has to parent this kid if no one else will. I tell cashier that isn\u2019t her card but her father\u2019s and I\u2019m not sure she has permission. Girl and friend turn and glare at me giving me possibly the dirtiest look I\u2019ve ever seen. I swear this girl was going to throw a tantrum right there, I don\u2019t think she was ever told no. Girl tells cashier her father gave her the card to shop with because it\u2019s the stores credit card and it gives him the points. Now that I\u2019ve pointed out it wasn\u2019t hers cashier tells her she can\u2019t use that card. Girl tries to show ID to prove they have the same last name ( yeah that will help) and I tell her it\u2019s still fraud. Girl says it\u2019s not fraud because she has permission and tells me to mind my own business. I tell her that it is my business that she\u2019s doing something illegal she needs to pay with her own card or I call the cops. Girl is pissed now and people are glaring at me. She uses her own card and leaves crying. Cashier looks mad at me and I tell my husband when I get home only for him to agree I was in the wrong.  So Reddit, ATIA?",

She is a very smart girl and I'm proud of what she's accomplished. But she's also young and naive in a lot of ways. She's easily manipulated. She doesn't pay much attention to her surroundings. She can't stand up for herself. She constantly still calls or texts myself and her father for help with things. More recently,  I've also been concerned about her doing dangerous things or submitting to peer pressure from her 'friends'. I've met them and they are not good kids. I've told her to stop talking to them but she refuses and tries to go behind my back. For these reasons (among others), her father and I have decided that we are not going to let her go off to college as long as she's a minor under our care. This means that she won't be going in fall ~~2025~~ 2024 because she doesn't turn 18 until that December. I am not trying to stifle her, but I do want her to be safe. She was recently talking about starting to fill out college applications and I told her not to bother. I explained that we weren't letting her go until she's old enough to make that decision for herself. She started crying and yelling at me but I refused to budge. I don't think I'm being unreasonable and honestly her reaction is more evidence of immaturity. But apparently she texted her Aunt who has been calling me an asshole. Am I the asshole? Edit: fall 2024, not fall 2025. Edit 2: people seem to think that I will not allow her to go to college at all. I am absolutely willing to let her go to college once she's 18 and we will pay for it, wherever she wants to go (we have the means).",

However I recently told my husband that I don't feel comfortable with the idea of his brother spending much time with my daughteronce she's born. It's not because of my BIL himself. We're not close but he's fine. The issue is his life choices. He's not married, has no intention of getting married or having kids, and dates only for sexual purpose. He dates multiple women and the only thing he has in common with them is that, like him, they are extremely good looking. He's highly intelligent, yet he has no interest in meaningful relationships. I spoke to him about his choices a few years ago, and after accusing me of being'moralistic', he claims that he always uses protection and he never leads the women on. Which I call BS on, as I can't imagineany woman with an increasing ticking biological clock would willingly be in a relationship which she knows doesn't have a future. Not to mention, what woman would want to be with someonewho may not even remember your name in a year's time? I mentioned this to my husband, however he called me an AH, and said that it was ridiculous to limit our daughter's access with her uncle just because I don't agree with his legal dating choices.

We have decided that we don\u2019t want children at our wedding. Not many of our friends and family have young children, and the ones that do are fine with getting a sitter for the weekend since we gave them a lot of notice. The only ones to put up a fight are my aunt and uncle who have a daughter with autism. She is 20, but will be 21 by the time my wedding day comes around. She is what they call \u201chigh-functioning\u201d, which means she can talk and wash/dress herself, and she has some friends. She graduated from high school a couple years ago and is currently living with her parents (my aunt and uncle) while working at a grocery store. Despite her being technically an adult I just don\u2019t see her as such. Every time I talk to her at a family gathering it\u2019s like talking to a child. She is obsessed with toy ponies and barbie dolls, and brings them up at every opportunity. She draws in her notebook constantly and never makes eye contact when talking to me. She does not have loud meltdowns like other special needs kids I\u2019ve met before, but I really don\u2019t want to risk her ruining my special day. I told my aunt and uncle that I didn\u2019t want her there and they became very upset. They said she already saw the invite and knew it was child-free but because she is an \u201cadult\u201d, she thought she was still included. My aunt tried to guilt me by saying she\u2019d already picked out a dress and a gift but I didn\u2019t want to hear it. My fianc\u00e9 says I\u2019m being an asshole and we should let her attend because she has attended other weddings before with no issue.

        "selftext": "This is a throwaway and I'm using fake names. I am 26F and my adopted sister Ally is 14F. The way we're related is that my younger brother Michael (24M) has been with his wife Maya (24F) since their freshman year of high school. Maya and Ally had a really bad home life and my mom is very much a my home is open to everyone type of person, so over that year Maya began spending more and more time at our house, eventually bringing Ally over as well since she was always babysitting. By the time Michael and Maya were 16 years old, Maya basically lived in the guest room and Ally spent after school, most weekends, holidays, and summer vacation at our house. My mom and dad say that they love both Maya and Ally like their own children. My other siblings (18M and 16F) also treat her like she's a part of the family. Even after Maya and Michael moved out, Ally is still at their house the same amount, if not more than she was before. Now to preface, I have nothing against Ally. She's a good kid and I make an effort to be nice to her. However, I've never really liked how she was foisted into our lives. She's not actually adopted and she *still has parents and her own family*. Yet my parents spend so much time and resources on her, it's ridiculous. Everyone else has started unironically calling her their daughter or sister and I've refused. I just don't consider her to be family. Anyways, I got married recently, which is where the issues start. I invited Ally to the wedding, of course, and she came with all of my other family. When we were doing pictures of the wedding parties, I decided that I wanted one with all of my immediate family (so my parents, my siblings, and Maya, and Maya and Michael's daughter). My mom brought Ally up to come take the picture with us and I was forced to tell her no. My mom started to get upset but then Ally said it was okay and sat down by herself. My mom isn't a very confrontational person so she didn't make a big deal of it but then everyone else realized that Ally wasn't there and they got mad as well. Ultimately, we took the photo how I wanted it because they didn't want to do this at my wedding but my entire family is pissed at me now. My mom said that Ally cried when she got home because I don't love her, which I don't. I feel like they forced into a position where I had to do an asshole thing by forcing this kid onto me. I don't think I should have to consider her family if I don't want to. AITA? Edit: After the ceremony but before the reception, the wedding party and both of our close family's took photos. I did not include Ally in this photo session and she sat with the rest of the regular guests waiting for dinner. I did not intentionally exclude her from any of the photos taken. I'm sure she's in some of them from throughout the night especially because she was there with my family. I hope that clears some things up. Edit 2: Maya and Ally are sisters. Sorry, forgot to explicitly say that in my post. Final edit:  The people who are agreeing with me are starting to convince me that I'm wrong. To the people calling my parents nasty things in my pms or just saying that they aren't good people: you're dead wrong. My mom is the most caring and kind-hearted woman in the world and I should have made that more clear in my post.  To be clear, I am also not a monster. I don't mistreat Ally. I get her birthday and Christmas gifts every year. However I am starting to understand that I did do a shitty thing by publicly excluding her at my wedding because I wanted it to be how exactly how I imagined, especially because my mom was apparently blindsided by my feelings. I was 16-18 when Ally started coming around a lot and I didn't form the same bond everyone else did. I never super liked being around kids, including my sister who by all accounts behaved way worse than Ally ever did. But I recognize that she's become a part of our family. And I think I'm going to make more of an effort to get to know her properly, because I do know she is very mature and intelligent for her age. Also, I don't mean to minimize what Maya and Ally have gone through. By saying she wasn't physically abused, I moroso meant to explain why she hadn't been legally removed from her mother's house. She does have extended family that actually cares about her but they live at minimum an hour away so she stays with my parents the majority of the time. Thank you for all of your input.",

My daughter (Anna) has recently started to date an African American man (Jamal). While I'm not exactly what you would refer to as liberal, he's a nice young man and as long as my daughter is happy, I'm happy. The problem is Anna is rather naive about the community she lives in. While her friends are quite content to see a relationship like hers, more than a few tongues are wagging in the community and a few people have privately expressed their concern to me. As I said, I have no problem with mixed relationships and I've set them straight, but I am painfully aware of how these matters are viewed by certain segments of the population. My parents are planning to come and stay with us for a week and Anna expressed a desire to introduce Jamal to them now that things were getting more serious between them. I told her on no uncertain terms that this wasn't going to happen. I may have no problem with Jamal, but they *absolutely will*, and even when the relationship ends they won't forget it. They might even go as far as to cut her off entirely. Anna was extremely upset by this and implied I was a racist and more concerned with what my parents think than how she feels. As I said, I know my parents. They simply aren't okay with mixed relationships and if Anna were to bring Jamal over even as a friend, they would be furious both at her *and* me. Anna is currently staying with Jamal and doesn't want to speak with me right now. My wife stands by me given she knows very well how my parents are (they had a problem with her for months over the *length of the skirt* she wore when I introduced her to them, for christs sake), but a close friend I confided in told me that I have behaved like an ass and that I needed to focus more on my daughter than pleasing my parents.

We are madly in love and ready to commit ourselves to each other fully.  My sister (26 F) has a problem with that though. She was supportive of my relationship with Derrick before we got engaged. When I sent her a text telling her we were engaged, she responded by saying \u201ccongratulations.\u201d But then when I saw her the week after that, she got all serious and said I should strongly consider the marriage.  She told me I was young and could meet people I loved more. That was offensive to me because I love Derrick more than anything, and she\u2019s basically saying my love isn\u2019t that important. She also told me that Derrick and I could date for longer before we got married. But we are already fully committed to each other, so we might as well get married and be recognized as soul mates in the eyes of the law.  Anyway, the conversation was so hurtful to me.

        "selftext": "My BF (33M) and I (29F) have been dating for 3 years.  He owns a house and lives there by himself.  I live in an apartment by myself.  We've talked about moving in together as that's the logical next step in our relationship and we both want to do it.  But I have some hang-ups related to moving into a house that I don't have any stake in.   I am refusing to pay any money that would go directly towards his mortgage.  I don't have any stake in the house, why would I contribute to his mortgage payments?  I'm ok helping with utilities, groceries, household items, etc. But paying his mortgage is a hard no from me.  I just don't think it makes any sense for me to pay towards his mortgage when I would get nothing from that if we were to break up.   His argument is that I would essentially be living with him for free and it would cause an uneven dynamic in our payment towards shared living expenses.  Which, I kind of get, but at the same time he's the one benefitting from paying down the mortgage and gaining equity, not me.  He also argued that his mortgage is pretty much exactly what I was paying in rent, so by cutting that in half I am saving a lot of money on living costs compared to living on my own.  Which, yeah, that's nice too, but legally it's still not my house. I told him the only way I would pay money for rent is if he signs a contract with me stating that any money I pay towards his mortgage will be paid back to me, by him, in the event that we break up.  It would also allow me protection from eviction and other basic tenant rights, similar to a rental agreement.  He is refusing to sign anything like that because, in his words, I could break up with him for no reason and then take him to court for thousands of dollars.  Which, I suppose is true but I wouldn't just break up with him for no reason. This whole situation is driving a wedge between us and he's pissed at me for being so difficult when all he thinks he is asking is that we split living expenses 50-50 if we are to live together.  To me, it's not that simple when he's the one owning the house we would live in.  If I were on the title, it would be a different story, but he's not willing to put me on the title because he's lived there for 7 years already.   My lease at my apartment is up in 2 months and I know I need to make a decision sooner than later.  It doesn't help that my landlord is going to be increasing my rent, and similar apartments in our area are going for even more than I'm currently paying.  But I just don't feel right contributing money towards his mortgage.  I also know that if I renew my lease, it's pretty much a dagger to our relationship, which I don't want because I do love him and see a future with him.  I just want to make sure I'm protected. I can tell my BF's patience on this is wearing thin and he's upset with me for digging my heels in on this.  But for me, this is about protecting myself for the worst-case scenario while he's not really risking anything.",

She says the gift bags. I found all the candy and toys and what I thought were the bags they were supposed to go into. So I make up the bags, my daughter helps, and she thinks they look great and she's happy with them. My wife comes home and takes over, satisfied by the new cake and the attempt I made at helping. So a little while after that, the guests arrive. The day went pretty well until the end. My daughter reminds us that they need to hand out gift bags. My wife panics thinking she forgot about them, but she says dont worry, dad made them and she looked so relieved until I got the box. She looked inside an was horrified What the fuck is this? she whispers. And she thrusts the box back at me and rushes to the bedroom. I follow her and find her sitting on the bed crying. She's SO embarrassed. Why? She wont say. I'm not sure what to do because people are trying to leave and they're confused as to whats going on. I then I just take over goodbye duty and hand out the bags to kids at the door and say bye with my daughter. Well halfway through doing that my wife came back out and took the box from me and brought it into the bedroom and threw it on the ground. wtf? she finally tells me those are dog poop bags and basically I'm stupid and I've ruined all the hard work she put into the party. well, reddit, they dont look like dog poop bags. they're just small pink bags with hearts on them. who really cares? I tell her It's not like they're dirty. they're small bags like any other bags and damn it she freaked. She says she's so mortified she doesnt even want to show her face at the school anymore. So yeah I've been bringing my daughter to school every day this week (which has been making me late for work). my wife will barely even speak to me even though my daughter thinks everything was fine. she laughed when i told her they were really dog poop bags. my wife got even more mad at me for telling her. I told my wife she needs to chill and she basically said I was a huge asshole and she's mad that I dont think it's a big deal. and I still dont. Actually, I think I'm the one that should be mad at HER for keeping this going for almost a week. So, Reddit, AITA? TL;DR: I used dog poop bags as goody bags by accident for 6 year old daughter's bday party",

This made my family feel let down especially my sister who wanted him there and also her 18th birthday was a big deal to her obviously.  To my surprise, When I arrived I noticed that my husband was having his meeting at the same place, his table was right in the corner and he had about 4 men sitting with him. My parents and the guests saw him as well. I waved for him and he saw me but ignored me. He obviously was as much as surprised as I was.  My parents asked why he didn't even come to the table to acknowledge them after the cake arrived. I got up and walked up to his table. I stood there and said excuse me, my husband was silent when I asked (after I introduced myself to the clients) if he'd take few minutes to join me and the family in candle blowing and say happy birthday but he barely let out a phrase and said I don't think so, I'm busy right now. I insisted saying it'd just take a couple of minutes and that it'd mean so much to my sister. He stared at me then stared awkwardly back at his clients. They said nothing and he got up after my parents were motionning for me to hurry up. He sat with us while my sister blew the candles and cut the cake. My parents insisted he takes a piece and join us in the selfie but he got up and walked back to his table looking pissed. We haven't talked til we met later at home. He was upset and starred scolding me infront of my parents saying I embarrassed him and made him look unprofessional and ruined his business meeting. I told him he overreacted since it only took few minutes and it was my sister's birthday and my family wanted him to join since he was literally in the same restaurant. He called me ignorant and accused me of tampering with his work but I responded that ignoring mine and my family's presence was unacceptable. We argued then he started stone walling me and refusing to talk to me at all. FYI) I didn't have an issue with him missing the event, but after seeing that he was already there then it become a different story. Also it literally took 5-7 minutes. He didn't even eat nor drink. Just sat down and watched.",

        "selftext": "So I recently found out that my boyfriend has been buying and drinking raw (unpasteurized) milk. He grew up on a farm and apparently his family always drank it straight from the cow, and he's been doing the same ever since we moved in together. At first I didn\u2019t think much of it (being a vegan I never drank it myself) but I started doing some research after I saw the label on it literally says not for human consumption. Apparently raw milk can carry harmful bacteria like salmonella, E. coli, and listeria. I freaked out when I read that, I don't want him to get sick or expose me to something dangerous. So, when I saw a fresh bottle of raw milk in our fridge yesterday I panicked and poured the entire bottle down the drain. I thought it was the safest thing to do. When my boyfriend got home he immediately noticed and was pissed. He said he spent a lot of money on that milk and that he\u2019s been drinking it for years without a problem. He accused me of not trusting him and said I had no right to throw away something he enjoys just because I disagree with it. I tried explaining that I was just concerned for his health and ours, but he said I was being a control freak. Now he's barely talking to me and I feel like there\u2019s this huge distance between us. AITA for pouring out the milk? I thought I was doing the right thing but I'm starting to wonder if I overstepped.",

        "selftext": "I 33M recently got hired at a large company in the south where me and my wife moved months ago. My wife was excited for my new job and talked about preparing a surprise for me which got me excited but I didn't what it was til she showed up at my workplace 2 days ago with a meal she said she prepared specifically for me since it's my favorite. Apparently this was her surprise. I was little upset she brought it to my workplace. My co workers who are vicious and brutally honest and sarcastic got involved and kept teasing me about the meal. one of them Austin joked about how mommy is so supportive by bringing food to my workplace. I felt like shit as he and other co workers kept laughing at me. I went to work the next day and Austinkept making jokes about me saying shit like is mommy going to bring lunch today as well? And When is mommy coming to change your diaper? And some other shit. one of them who's someone I don't know well said oh you guys I can still smell the meal (my name's) mom brought yesterday. She's such great cook bless her heart! And the goddamned giggles kept on. I felt so awful I went home and just blew up at my wife telling her she flatout fucking embarrassed me and just torpedoed any goddamned prestige and respect I had among my co workers. I told her what Austin and others have been doing and asked if she was happy for giving him emmo to come at me like that. She argued that she was just trying to do something nice for me and didn't care about what people might say but I was a selfish jerk who only cares about what others think rather than how she felt by my constant berating over a meal she put effort money and time to make and bring to me. The argument escalated after I suggested that she could've waited til I got home to surprise me with this goddamned meal instead of showing up while I was working which made me seem unprofessional. she said she came during lunch break but I was still working during lunch break. She said at this point I clearly find it easier to blame her than stand up for myself against those childish bullies. I said I didn't appreciate what she said but she replied that I should be grateful she cared enough to bring me a home cooked meal then thanked me for showing her it's not worth wasting anymore of her time cooking for me after this. I told her to stop blaming me for something she caused and asked her to admit that maybe she should've consulted me before bringing the meal over so I could avoid being the goddamned butt of every joke my co workers told. I don't even know how long this is going to last. She told me to man up and either report them or quit then. I was floored by what she said I had to walk out becuase I couldn't take anymore of this and felt like she wasn't listening to how her behavior caused me an issue at work. Edit to say that I in no way don't appreciate my wife's effort but the only problem I have is that she didn't tell me beforehand about wether it was okay to bring the meal over to my workplace. I really prefered that she waited til I got home or we could've gone out later to eat. I agree that the main problem I have is my co workers but I lashed out because I felt overwhelmed with their hurtful remarks that offended my wife as well.",

        "selftext": "I (28m) and have been married to my wife Bella (28f) for 5 years. We both met and went to the same college. She pre-law while I was doing animation. She graduated top of our class and went to a T20 law school. While she was in law school, I had a lot of trouble finding a job in my field or a job at all, really. I ended up working in a kitchen as a line cook to help support us (in addition to loans she took out) while she was going to school so she could just focus on her classes. Bella got a very good job in a different state after she graduated, so I quit my job and haven't gotten another one since. We have no kids, a nice house for the two of us, and are overall living very very comfortably. She works very long hours, so I take care of most of the household things. Cleaning, cooking, grocery shopping, re-painting the walls and doing other work and renovations to the house. In the last 6 months Bella's started referring to me as her house husband around our family and friends. I've mostly been letting it go but every single time it bothers me. I'm already insecure about not being able to find a good job and it makes me feel even more inadequate. I finally got to the end of my rope when we were with her mother on Sunday, who still doesn't really approve of me, and they were talking about taking care of the lawn/garden and she said, Thank goodness I have a house husband for that or I'd never find the time and smiled at me. Then they both laughed. It was humiliating.  I didn't say anything at first but I guess she could tell that I was really upset and asked what was wrong. I told her that she needed to stop emasculating me and making it seem like I didn't contribute anything to the household. We were arguing back and forth and she told me that she would stop calling me a house husband if I was going to get that upset about it but that it wasn't an untrue term and I needed to stop being insecure.  Bella refuses to apologize. I feel like she doesn't fully appreciate my value as her husband. I've stopped doing the chores until she apologizes and she is beyond pissed off. She's been coming home and cooking dinner (only for herself) and doing the chores I haven't and then taking off to spend the night at a friends house. I was talking to my sister about it and she told me that Bella was wrong but I was being immature in my response. The thing is, if I give in she's going to keep thinking what she's been doing is okay. I don't even know anymore. AITA?",

        "selftext": "My BIL (married to my sister) is a general contractor. About 10 years ago, my dad and brother was building a deck at my parent\u2019s home. They asked my BIL if they could borrow his skid loader but he said no. They prepared the ground as best they could without the skid loader but got to the point they couldn\u2019t go on without it. They went to my sis\u2019s house to ask again but found out BIL went out of town. They talked my sis into letting them borrow it so she took them down to his construction lot and they hooked it up to dad\u2019s truck.  This next part I\u2019m not sure of since I don\u2019t know much about towing but from what I was told, dad\u2019s truck wasn\u2019t big enough or powerful enough to tow the skid loader on the dump trailer so he lost control and wrecked. The truck, trailer, and skid loader was totaled. The insurance was barely enough to cover the medical costs and the truck. There was none left over to cover BIL\u2019s stuff. When he got back to town, he exploded. He threaten to sue and things just went downhill from there. My parents are not rich and he wouldn\u2019t have gotten anything so in the end, sis talked him into letting it go.  However, from that day on he wouldn\u2019t have anything to do with our family. He doesn\u2019t come for birthdays, holidays, nothing at all. Next month is our parent\u2019s 50th anniversary and we\u2019re planning a big family gathering to celebrate. We\u2019re also chipping in to send our parents on a cruise to Mexico because they\u2019ve never been out of the country. I spoke to sis about it the other day and she said she\u2019s coming with the kids but BIL is not coming. I was fine with that but when we were discussing their portion of the cruise money, I heard him yelling in the background to deduct their portion from the cost of the skid loader and dump trailer. That pissed me if so after my call with sis, I called BIL and told him to get over himself. I told Dad and bro made a mistake but that was 10 years ago and he needs to let it go. He said he\u2019ll let out go when they give him the money he lost. I told him he\u2019s an ass for holding on to a grudge and putting money in the way of a family relationship.  Sis called me a few minutes ago and said they\u2019re not coming and that I was out of line. We argued for a bit and that\u2019s where it stands.  I don\u2019t think I\u2019m wrong for telling him to let go of the past but they\u2019re not coming to the anniversary party so now I\u2019m not sure. Answers to your questions: Let\u2019s get something straight. My dad and brother are not bad people. They are good people who made a mistake. They couldn\u2019t pay back BIL because he wanted almost $70,000 and again, we\u2019re not rich. Dad had to buy another truck because he needed it to go to work. On the other hand, BIL had 3 other sets of skid loaders and dump trailers on his lot that day so he could take the financial hit while my parents would be homeless. BIL and sis are way better off then the rest of us so while I understand your reasoning of paying BIL back, he doesn\u2019t need it. The cruise to Mexico isn\u2019t some millionaire trip. The total cost is about $3,000 and it\u2019ll take over 20 people to pay for that. Again, we\u2019re not rich. We can barely cover $3,000 spread out over 20 people so there\u2019s no way we can pay $70,000.",

I moved in with him after our marriage because the rent was super cheap. My parents recently came to me asking if they could park their RV at our home.I didn\u2019t see a problem with this. Our yards are really big and there is space.Because of city ordinance the RV has to be parked in the back yard. There was no RV gate in the fence. My husband went to his aunt and asked if we could install a rv gate? His aunt said no. My husband relayed the message to me and my parents seemed upset when I told them. 2 days ago. I came home from work and saw that my dad had a construction crew at our home and had removed part of the fence for the gate. There was a apple tree in the way. They couldn\u2019t fit the RV in the yard. My husband angry told my dad not to continue and that they needed to repair the fence.At this point I felt like it was pointless. The fence guys already built the columns for the gate. It would cost a lot more money to rebuild the fence. I told my dad to finish the job but make sure it was left super clean. That it looked nice. I planned on talking to the aunt later and explain what happened.What I didn\u2019t know was my dad told the guys to remove the tree. My husbands aunt came by and saw the tree cut down and started to cry. She has refused to talk to my dad or me. When my husband came home he found a 30 day notice on our door.Terminating our lease.

Step-daughter and I get along fine no big issues but we also are not super close. Now that the baby is coming we need more space unfortunately we can't afford a new home. I brought up to my husband asking Step-daughter to move out. My reasoning is that we really need her room for the new baby and she is an adult with a full time job so it is time for her to be on her own anyway. My husband agreed and we brought it up to her at dinner one night. We told her we would help with her first 2 months rent. I told her it would be fun her and I could go shopping and I will help her decorate her new apartment. We tried to be as gentle as we could but she was very quiet.  Privately she told my husband that even though she as a full time job she cannot afford to live on her own. My husband told her she did not need to move out so now we are scrambling trying to find space for new baby. The other day I was home alone with Step- daughter and tried to talk to her about it again. I offered  to help her find a roommate and she snapped on me. She snapped on me and told me to just leave her alone and locked herself in her room. When my husband got home from work he was mad at me and told me to leave her alone and not bring it up anymore.

My MIL says it's showing off and my FIL always says it isn't christian. Now I'm pretty feminine, so I don't mind throwing on a dress when we stop by, but our daughters are not. They don't like visiting my husbands parents, which breaks his heart, because we make them put on a dress before they go. They are both pretty tomboyish, and they never wear any dresses otherwise. I had to but each of them a few dresses specifically so they can go. To be clear it's not like they aren't allowed over if they wear pants, it's just that they won't shut up the entire time about how much they hate it. Our daughters hate this, and think it's unfair. I guess it is, but in a lot of cultures women only wear skirts and dresses so I don't think it's a big deal. Plus it isn't like it hurts them to wear a dress a few times a week for a few hours. The issue is our oldest is planning to never speak to her grandparents again after she's 18, and I'm worried it's affecting them.",

        "selftext": "My son is 8 years old and recently attended his friend's 8th birthday party. This friend is my best friend's son. I don't let my son have any/much junk food at all and usually he brings his own snacks (for this incident it was carrot sticks and ranch) to events that have a lot of sugary foods. My best friend bakes a lot, and made a special chocolate cake for her son's birthday. When it comes to my son, I don't let him have cake. This is personal preference for his health, not for any allergy reasons, and he is not diabetic or gluten free. My son knows he isn't allowed to have cake because of the additives. When he told his best friend this at the party, his friend apparently got upset and told him it was good cake, not bad like I say, because his mom made it, and it was his birthday cake. My son ate cake, got a sugar rush, and crashed, making him cranky for the rest of the day after we left the party.  I told my friend she needs to have some kind of consequences for her son to teach him not to peer pressure other children into eating things they're not allowed to have. She said because it wasn't an issue of allergies or health, that she's sorry my son was cranky but she won't be punishing her son or talking to him about it on his birthday. She says also that she'll just that she'll watch more closely/make sure her husband does in the future, as well as have a chat with him on another day about respecting food habits. (I love my friend, but historically, her and her husband have always said 'yes' to their son and not given him any consequences for anything.) Both of us were present at the party and did not see them sharing the cake (they were outside eating in the backyard with their fathers and some other parents supervising while we cleaned up) so it's not an issue of anyone going behind anyone's back, just teaching children boundaries and respect.  I let my son stay for the rest of the party and be with his friend, so it's not like I ruined the day.  AITA for being upset with my friend's son and the fact that she won't punish her son for pressuring my son into eating cake?",

        "selftext": "To start, free bleeding is essentially not wearing any form of protection on your period (so you are bleeding freely - clues in the name). I'm currently staying at my MILs house with my husband for a family get together (six birthdays in one week). I have horrifically painful periods and bad mobility. I can not use cups and am allergic to all brands of pad I've used (rashes on all genitalia, which does not feel good). I do have cloth pads but I only brought a couple small ones for my trip as I wasn't due on until days after we got home, but we're on day four of our trip and I started my period on our first night.  I tried to use some disposable pads I picked up but I broke out in a rash and have blisters everywhere they should not be, so two days ago I decided to say what the hell and free bleed like I do at home. I bring my own towels to my MILs, so I have been sitting and sleeping on those. I have bled through twice but cleaned the mess and left no stain.  My MIL is pissed off to say the least. She's disgusted by my lack of decorum and carrying my bloody towel around everywhere. She also hates that I'm washing them in her machines and is now saying we need to pay to have them professionally cleaned (which we will do). Everything kinda came to a head last night when she lost it on me for behaving like an animal. She wants me to leave, but my husband stay, which isn't possible (one car, I can't drive that far, especially not with the amount of pain I'm in). My husband is on damage control but I just feel so shitty. Am I in the wrong here? I understand that it's not super sanitary but my health matters more than some bed sheets. I'll replace them if she wants. I'm close to just gritting my teeth through the pain and putting a pad on, but I really don't want to. I don't want open sores down there when we're driving home - sitting for that long will suck. AITA? I feel like I'm choosing the lessar of two evils but now I don't know.",

I don\u2018t normally go through her room, but the router for the house is in there, and I needed to reset it. When I go into her room, I found a mushroom cap on black paper hidden underneath her desk. I look up what the hell it is and it is a spore print for magic mushrooms. I go through her room further to find an entire damn aqarium filled with mushrooms in the back of her closet. obviously I am enraged, so I wait for her to get back from school, and I called the police. She was arrested, booked and released into her mother\u2019s custody. Her mother is pissed, and saying that I may have ruined the kids life for no reason, but we have tried to correct her drug abuse several times to no avail, and it has escalated. She now has a court date and can answer to the law since she doesn\u2019t take the rules in my house seriously. I doubt she\u2019ll get more than probation anyway.

My daughter has a small walk in closet that is, honestly, so messy that I don\u2019t bother to look in there too much. Because she has been passing her drug tests, I have been cutting her slack.

Our culture dictates that Peggy\u2019s father and I share the costs for their wedding. He (her father) said we should provide $10k each, a total $20k budget. I could afford this sure but This seems insane and extravagant to me. I said I would give $5k and he could give whatever he wanted. Peggy\u2019s father also put up 5k. I told my son this and he told me outright it wasn\u2019t going to be enough. He said \u201cI don\u2019t mind, I figured that me and Peggy would have to pay for some of the wedding\u201d. I asked what he meant. He said no way would they be able to do their wedding in under $10k. I said My own wedding, after haggling and deals, only came out to around $7k so I do not think this is an issue. He argued against me and said that my wedding was 40 years ago and prices were different. He outlined some prices and said the cheapest venue he could find was $5k, and food alone was going to be $2,5k. He again said he didn\u2019t mind and he thanked me for giving them money for the wedding but I honestly felt hurt that he thought we were not giving enough. I said how could food come out to 2500 dollars and he said that that was only around $25 per person. I suggested ordering pizzas or sub sandwiches but he looked at me like I was crazy. I said okay well we can just offer less for the photographer and decorator and he said that isn\u2019t how things are done. I said it is how things are done, and maybe if Peggy and him weren\u2019t so spoiled and expecting the best of the best for everything then $10k would be plenty. After I said this he just closed his eyes and thanked me for the money and basically told me to get out. I was complaining about this instance to my wife and she told me I was being a stick in the mud and it\u2019s his only wedding. My friends agree with me though. AITA?",

        "selftext": "My girlfriend (25F) and I (29M) live in NYC and there's a popular app where you buy leftover restaurant food. Restaurants advertise surprise bags at a reduced price in order to reduce foodwaste. The customer doesn't know what they're getting until they pick the food up, but the cost at least 3x lower than the normal menu price. (EG if an entree is usually $24, the restaurant is allowed to charge $8 at most for it.) These are hit or miss - sometimes you get exactly what you want at a greatly reduced price, but sometimes you get something that you otherwise wouldn't have picked from the menu. I ordered a surprise bag from a barbecue place that I was picking up on the way home yesterday. I texted my girlfriend asking if she wanted one but she said no, she wasn't in the mood for barbecue. However, there was an indian restaurant right next door that also had surprise bags available on the app, so she ordered one of them. The barbecue was $12 and the indian food was $10. When I get home I unpack the meals to see what we got. I was psyched about my bag. Since I paid $12 I knew the value had to be at least $36, but honestly the platter looked a lot more expensive. This was a hit. (Keep in mind that we live in the west village, which is the most expensive neighborhood in the most expensive city in the US, so $36 for one meal is pretty typical.) There were burnt ends, ribs, pulled pork, baked beans, potato salad, bread, onions, and pickles. My girlfriend, however, was  less lucky. Her surprise bag only had 6 different types of soup, half of them being variations on cauliflower soup. She was disappointed to say the least. She asked if we should share my barbecue and I said no, i'm hungry, I offered to buy you some already and you said no, so I'm going to devour it. She got mad and called me the asshole. I told her if she didn't want soup she should have ordered something specifically instead of using the surprise bag app. I then told her to just order something off a food delivery app. She said she didn't want to spend the money (another bit of context is I make a lot more money than her and pay all of our rent, I know she's running a bit of a lean financial picture right now.) I then tell her that if she doesn't want to pay for delivery, I'll walk to the bodega on our street and can buy her something there. (Another bit of context is that we live on a 4th floor walkup with no elevator and she broke her leg in a car accident a month ago, so it can be tough for her to get around.) She says she the grill is probably off there and all she wants is a hot meal. I tell her she has soup. Anyway, she thinks I'm the asshole. But in my defense: (1) I offered to buy her barbecue to begin with, which she declined. (2) she picked out her own food and I grabbed it for her on my way home (3) when she wasn't satisfied, I suggested two solutions (either ordering something from an app or going to a bodega) So, Reddit, AITA?",

        "selftext": "Background: My wife rarely goes out with friends (~6 times/year) and has never been very social and prefers spending time with me. I am more social, but that has declined as we have focused on our family (we have a 2 year old daughter), and I spend time with the same 3 friends once/week for games night (sometimes in person, sometimes online). I have another 3 friends that I see only once every 2 months, also for games night. If I go out my wife will tend to our daughter (I often still help with dinner/bed time, but sometimes leave earlier than this). Our daughter's bed time is 7:30pm, and she often sleeps through the night without fuss (wakes up fussing maybe 5% of the time). I always offer for my wife sleep in the next day, or something similar in exchange for me going out so that It's not a one-sided thing. Scenario: My wife made plans to spend an evening this weekend out with friends, she would be out from 6pm until late. After she made those plans, I was invited to my friends birthday thing with my second friend group, if I went I would be gone from 5pm until late. Last time I saw them was exactly one month ago. I brought this plan up with my wife as I wanted to make arrangements for a family member to take our daughter for the evening. She was irritated by this, and argued that I should stay home. I have since spoken with a family member who is happy to take our daughter at 5pm and have her stay the night and I have communicated this to my wife. I made it clear that this will not affect her plans at all, I will be responsible for dropoff and pickup of our daughter, and will not ask anything of my wife because I understand that it is rare for her to have a night out like this and so I don't want her to change her plans at all. She still thinks that I should stay home. Her arguments: - She says that since she always covers for me that I should also cover for her- She doesn't want to ask this family member to have our daughter for the night because she thinks we ask too much of them My arguments: - I am covering for her as she does not have to change her plans and doesn't have to do anything for our daughter- This family member loves watching our daughter, and my wife is often quick to agree to leave our daughter there for sleepovers plenty of other evenings out of convenience (eg: we will be there for dinner and put our daughter to sleep there so we can visit longer, then we will leave her there for the night) so I don't see why this time its too much to ask I feel like she wants me to stay home as a form of punishment for going out more frequently than she would prefer. Punishment feels too strong of a word, I don't think there is any major resentment behind this or anything, I just don't know how else to describe the feeling. So, AITA here for making plans to go out the same night my wife also already had plans to go out, even though I am covering all arrangements for our daughter for the evening? Edits: - Not sure why everyone thinks I'm planning on getting drunk, but I would not be drinking if I went to the birthday.- I would also be the on-call parent and would tend to our daughter in case of any emergency- I used the word cover to describe solo-parenting as that is the word my wife used when we spoke. Neither of us are the type of people to call parenting babysitting when it is solo.- The punishment I am referring to is about missing out on celebrating with a friend, it is NOT referring to spending time with my daughter- Just because my wife only goes out 6 times a year does not mean that is her only free time. We have 5 evenings free every week where she can either do her own thing or we can spend it together. We share the evening on-duty time equally- The vast majority (like 90% or more) of my time out is spent after my daughter is asleep, the normal routine is for both of us to do dinner/bath/bed routine, and then for me to leave afterwards- The family member I am referring to is on my wife's side, however we are very close with them and it is normal for me to talk to them directly, they feel just as much my family at this point as they are hers- The family member is also very experienced putting our daughter to bed without us being there- My daughter has her own room at this family members house, as well as another's. This is because they care for our daughter on the 3 days a week where both my wife and I work so that we don't have to pay for daycare. We are extremely lucky to have such helpful family, and the reason she has her own room/bed at these places isn't because we pawn her off there frequently, it is because she naps at these places 3 days a week, and on occasional evenings. Both family members are empty nesters who admittedly love caring for our daughter, and other young family members. We try to compensate them but they often refuse, and they even go so far as to ask to have our daughter over.",

        "selftext": "I (40f) was a single mother to my daughter, Amy (15f). I came out 3 years ago and married my wife Jenna (42f) last year. She has a daughter, Nora (13f). We all live together as I have full custody of my daughter. It was kind of hard for her to adjust to having a second mom, but they got along well. The girls have their birthdays very close, only two days apart, so we decided to have a joint birthday party for both of them, since Nora had a hard time making new friends (they moved in with us and she's very shy). Most of my family lives out of the country, so the gifts were sent a week early. It was a huge bag, with at least 20 gifts. The party was nice and we opened the bag at night once everyone left. Jenna handed out the presents as she took them out. After 12 gifts in a row just for Amy, I checked the bag and froze to see that there was only one gift for Nora, from my parents. She pretended it wasn't a big deal, but as she opened the present I saw her eyes drop. It was a $15 tumbler from Walmart. Not to sound ungrateful, but Amy's gifts were much more expensive (lots of gift cards over $100, a new phone, limited-edition Funkos, designer clothes and lots of cards wishing her a happy birthday). Needless to say, I blew up the family chat, calling out my parents, siblings, and extended family who sent gifts for not considering Nora and my parents for the cheap gift. No one took me seriously since: *It's not our duty to give gifts to someone else's kid* and *Amy deserved them, since I didn't even throw her her own birthday party,* emphasizing that Jenna and Nora are my problem, not theirs. Nora was clearly hurt, since it's not the first time my family has left her out. At night, I asked Amy to share some of the gifts with her stepsister. Not all of them, just a couple of gift cards and some of the new clothes. Amy refused. This surprised me, since she never had a problem with sharing and even though she and Nora are not BFF's, they usually get along. After asking why, Amy started crying, saying that she never wanted a joint birthday party, and that I force her to share everything with Nora. They share a room for space and I make sure they're both invited to the same parties and sleepovers, so that Nora won't be left out. If they don't invite both of them, then either of them goes. Amy stated that she at least wanted her own gifts to be hers alone. I scolded her for being selfish with her stepsister, grounded her and took a couple of the presents to give to Nora. She turned them down because she didn't want problems with Amy and it felt like pity. Since then, Amy has been cold to all of us. I just wanted my two girls to be closer with the joint party and have the same things. AITA? Clarification: Jenna and I bought gifts for the girls (their own tablets), as well as their friends. Nora also received gifts from her extended family, but they sent for Amy as well.",

Well, recently the older daughter has been disrespectful at home and staying out too late, and her grades have been slipping.

She got really upset and offended, and said we promised she'd never have to go in there or have to scoop horse poop. I said I promised it wouldn't be one of your chores, of course, but obviously a punishment is supposed to be something outside of your normal chores and something you won't like, and I thought it was perfectly fair here. She's been doing it three days now but seems to be very resentful of our broken promise, acting very disgusted, and keeps begging to get out of the rest of it. But I said I thought it's very fair and that she's overreacting.

During the time she spent on her degrees, I managed to get married and start my own family.  Diana was visiting her family and we met up for lunch. I asked her about her degree, work prospects, etc. (She did her masters in translation or interpreting or something like that) and she said she got the job but will have to move to Brussels. I told her that\u2019s crazy. If she can\u2019t find a job locally, then her degree was a waste of time if she has to move to another country.She said it\u2019s an amazing job opportunity that she couldn\u2019t get anywhere around here (apparently the job is related to EU parliament or whatever, I admit it, I lost her with all the abbreviations she was using). She again said that it\u2019s an amazing opportunity and she\u2019s excited.I asked her about the pay and she told me. I said that my husband earns that without a degree so I was right about the Easter of time and money, and she said it\u2019s  starting salary and it\u2019ll grow because the first year I saw pretty much training and being in a junior position.I again said that she could\u2019ve gotten a similar job here and wouldn\u2019t have wasted 6 years Andy instead could\u2019ve already work Andy start a family.And here\u2019s where she was rude, she said that if she was to be as unhappy as I was, she didn\u2019t want a family\u2019s. She threw in my face that apparently I\u2019m always complaining about my husband but I\u2019m criticising her, he\u2019s the best husband in the world.I told her she\u2019s ridiculous and mean and she called me an asshole, paid and left the restaurant.I to,d my friends about this and they\u2019re split in who\u2019s the asshole here so tell me, Aita for telling her the truth?",

        "selftext": "I know how the title sounds, hear me out. My [26M] gf [24F] takes forever in the bathroom. Upwards of 1 hour, sometimes closer to 2. When I playfully ribbed her about this, she'd get irritated but nothing major. 3 months ago I was playfully teasing her and she flipped out. She said she won't do anything anymore, and true to her word she hasn't shaved, waxed, or put on makeup since then, and wears her hair looking like bedhead. I told her that I got her point and would appreciate it if she resumed doing things that I also do to stay presentable. Her head hair improved a bit (although not even close to how it was before) but she still has hair on her legs and underarms, semi-unibrow etc. Now she's saying I have to pay her to resume taking care of herself, which I find crazy as I'm not her sugar daddy. Why should I pay for her to upkeep herself like she's my sugar baby? I understand that it's her body, her choice etc., but if there are any guys out there who think they would be ok if their gf had long underarm hair then you're a better man than me. I haven't pushed her to do anything, nor am I enforcing any ultimatums. If, as she says, I've been conditioned to want her to look a certain way... well, that sucks, but it's not my fault. If we broke up, she'd pay for all of this beauty stuff herself, so why should I pay? Anyone who says I'm TA, are you going to then start paying for all your girlfriends' beauty regimens, or else be fine with 100% body hair and no makeup or hair care ever? Be honest with yourselves. **Gf's side:** He keeps being a dick about how long I would take in the bathroom, so as he said, I quit things he didn't even realize I was doing. No makeup, no shaving/waxing, no brows, no waxing those moustache hairs, I have curly frizzy hair so I stopped using product or straightening/curling with an iron, no mani/pedi, no touching up or redoing my highlights. Do I look like a beast? Sure. Am I a comfy, smug beast? Hell yes. He rightfully pointed out that he takes care of himself for me (by shaving his beard and cutting his hair), so I obligingly waxed my upper lip and got a haircut. I'm continuing to do this whole thing because 1) it's so much less effort for me, 2) it's way cheaper, and 3) now that I stopped, I feel like... why do I ever have to do all this shit. It's unfair. And if I have to do it because both of us have been conditioned to see me doing these things as the basic standards for a woman, then he should pay half the costs. I conservatively spend at least $1k a year on brows, shaving supplies, hair products, highlights, haircuts, and makeup. Conservatively. He should have to pay me at least half if he wants me to do it, and extra for painful things like bikini waxes if he wants me to do them again. Otherwise it's not fair. **Both:** We love each other a lot and aren't actually fighting. We recognized that we're having a difference in opinion, and since neither has been able to sway the other we came to the court of public opinion. **EDIT (from bf):** alright, I'm the asshole. You know, it wasn't even the people saying I *was* the asshole that convinced me so much as the people saying I wasn't. No way in hell do I want to hold the same opinion as some of you, so if you think I'm not TA then I definitely am. My girlfriend not wanting to *remove body hair* is not the same as me walking around without showering, in stained shirts and greasy hair. Jesus. The amount of sexist pigs that personally reached out to assure me that I'm not TA and the Reddit commenters are comprised of libtards, cucks, feminazis, etc... man. I think it's reasonable to say that I'm allowed to no longer be attracted to her physically after this, and in that case I would either pay up or we break up. However, luckily, I am still very much into her. I would *highly prefer* the lack of body hair, but it's far from a dealbreaker and I think those who pointed out that I should be trying to unlearn these standards are correct. As I said before, this was never a fight. And for all of you calling my gf a fugly whatever and telling me I can do much better, she's always hot as fuck, have fun in your mom's basement tonight. **EDIT 2 (from gf):** Thank you, Reddit, for knocking some sense into this mans. He let me shave his legs. He said he feels like a dolphin. I've decided his genuine contrition and heartfelt apologizing is enough for me and will resume shaving my pits for him, and doing my brows and hair (I didn't spend years subscribed to r/curly only to let my hair turn into a shitshow now)",

My daughter (16) has a thing for baking, she bakes cakes and some (I said some not all!) sweets and makes money out of it by selling her work to relatives, friends and supposedly us! My husband's (Her stepdad) 45th birthday took place days ago. He asked my daughter to bake him the birthday cake and she agreed. I told him about paying her to which he responded with pfff pay her? Get outta here, I'm her dad!. I insisted seeing she's a yes person and a people's pleaser so won't outright demand the money from him. He said he'd pay but days went by and he didn't pay her a cent.  I decided to go ahead and sell the wrist watch I bought him as his birthday cake and pay her for her. He foubd out and went off on me. I told him he had rnough time and shouldve paid her seven before he recieved the cake. He said that I was teaching her to treat familial relationship as transactional and raiding her to be materialistic. I explained the time, effort and even money she put towards making the cake but he lashed out verbally calling me an asshlle for making this move and for enabling my daughter to expect so much from family that she's supposed to help with nothing in return. He's furious and told almost the whole family about how I took back his birthday gift and returned it. I got enough shame from family members to begin to think that I might be an asshole for how I dealt with this. AITA? Ya'll, my daughter did want and expect to be paid. If she intended for it to be for free then I would have kept my mouth shut. And also the wristwatch idn't expensive. I kept the rest of the money after giving my daughter her share.",

        "selftext": "I had a party at my house last night. I have an antique slot machine from the 1940s that is in absolutely spotless and working condition in my living room. My step grandma was a show girl she she got it while dating a count room guy prior to meeting my grandpa. Over the years people have played it and maybe won a few quarters here and there. Maybe a max of $50 at a time. As far as I know the jackpot was never hit on it so however it works there was probably about $700 in the jackpot reserve that had built up over the years. I\u2019d never bothered to have it cleaned out since it just seemed like a fun novelty.  Well a friend\u2019s friend hit the jackpot last night. I was fucking floored when he legit thought he could keep my ~$700. His case was hed been playing with his own money and I would have kept his quarters. My argument  was I\u2019d be happy to give him his quarters back if he\u2019d asked but I\u2019m not a casino and while I\u2019m not destitute, I can\u2019t afford to give someone $700. Argument caused the party to wind down and one of my best guy friends basically told the guy he\u2019d be in real shit if he tried to leave with the money but the guy left threatening to come back with the cops and sue me in small claims court. I have no idea if that was realistic but no cops came back.  So was I the asshole for nor letting him keep the money? Edit: sorry guys I can't answer such witticisms as why are you so shity? because I've been banned. Edit2: wow since I\u2019m a \u201cbaby gangster\u201d who has been running an \u201cillegal gaming operation\u201d (both things that have been said) I might as well just go whole hog and start running guns and pimping underage Andean alpacas to people who would pay for the privilege. I\u2019m really that bad? I just thought I had a cool thing my step grandma got by banging a dude from the count room. Edit3: gotta address this one directly: >If this was really last night, give it a week or a month and see how many friends, especially mutual friends, are no longer talking to you. Forget our votes, listen to those. Also forget small claims, you need to worry more about hearing from your state's gambling commission. If the moderators allow me to update, I will ABSOLUTELY update and tell you how many friends I\u2019ve lost. Almost everyone  (including the friend that brought the \u201cwinner\u201d thought he was being a total asshole for the way he was down on his hands and knees scooping up quarters off the floor to put in his pockets. And he was lying about much he put into the machine too (he said $75\u2013who the fuck walks around, nuch less even get $75 in quarters\u2014when going to a party at a strangers house). In addition, I will gladly, gladly call our state gaming commission (AZ) and ask what trouble I might be in. I will also update on that when I can. People CAN\u2019T be this dramatic in real life...I\u2019m a ducking instagram influencer for my job, the phoniest, most vapid, saddest job a person can have right now and I\u2019m still blown away by some of these comments. Call me YTA all you like, but don\u2019t be stupid and claim to have knowledge you don\u2019t  in the process. Edit4: well I was banned for joking around, other people have bad posts calling me a cunt up for over an hour.  Makes INFO hard but I\u2019ll try to explain my thinking on the money in the machine and why I can\u2019t \u201cafford\u201d to give it to him.  Say you have a change jar, has $100 in it. Your good friend asks to borrow $25, for parking, you'd say yes right? Another friend says wow, that\u2019s cool I have $1.25 in my pocket, can I donate to your change jar? You\u2019d say yes. Now let\u2019s say a guy you\u2019ve never met says \u201chey I just put .80 into your change jar, now I\u2019m taking the whole thing.\u201d You would say no. It\u2019s how I\u2019ve always seen the slot machine as huge change jar for all my close friends to use. I\u2019ve given people quarters to play, I\u2019ve taken a quarter here and there from people who wanted to see it work. I\u2019ve taken in maybe $100 over five years. Maybe. That\u2019s a nickel a day. that\u2019s not a freaking illegal gambling operation. Edit5: a good question: >INFO Did he explicitly ask if he was allowed to play it, and keep what he wins? If no then he played it without permission, you aren't running a casino. No he did not, the first time I ever saw or spoke to him was when he was on his hands and knees picking quarters up off the floor slamming them his pockets.  I don't mind if people play it, I even give people quarters to play it (since no one has change anymore) but he did not ask. Edit6: another good question >Also, need more info. You stated that other guests have won small jackpots in the past (max $50). Did you let them keep it? If so, why are you making a double-standard here? I would have let him keep $50-100 (he certainly got away with some in his pockets) but he was such an asshole right away that he didn't give me the chance to come to any sort of deal. Most everyone at the party just wanted him gone. I do feel bad and maybe my guilt over the apparent double standard is why I'm asking here. But I do feel as though had he been even slightly cool and not threaten cops or lawsuits I wouldn't have been backed into a corner. Edit7:  >INFOWe need to know where the money came from. Did the money in the machine come from YOU putting it in or playing the machine So this is all guess work based on what my grandma said the jackpot could hold (there's a window that shows the coins in rhe jackpot, the space behind is about the size of a big shoe box). She said it gets full at $800. It was more than half when she and my grandpa gave it to me, I always guessed $500. In five years it's now 7/8ths full. I play it from to time to time so I'd say $100 of that is mine and $100 is friends. I think the jackpot and normal pay outs come from different boxes so last night was the last night I've ever seen that window empty. I know nothing of the machine or how it works or how to change settings so I may be so wrong and a slot machine nerd could correct me if I'm way off base. Edit8: this is the best yta take so far and I can't let it get buried. > I really hope you get into some serious legal trouble and then you\u2019ll wish all you lost was several hundred and not thousands including jail time. Edit9 (at 5:45am, gotta work): you guys are really cracking me up. I love the comments that say your edits make you YTA! Alone. Where did the money come from btw?  I truly can accept the YTA votes but so freaking many of them have basic facts wrong. 1. I wasn't profiting off this machine. I've literally never opened it up and taken a single coin out. 2. I can't afford to give a random dude $700. I don't need it now, but I have savings account I don't need it now either but I might some day. And now I've found out that some of the quarters that my grandma had from the 50s or 60s might actually be silver. So good thing I hung onto them right ? (I can't wait for the you're a stupid thot rationalizations to come from this one).  3. I never cleaned it out because honestly I like the way it looked with the coins in the window. This thing is enourmous and built with casino security in mind so it was in fact, a great piggy bank.  4. Some nice NTAs have suggested I have a bowl of quarters a for people to play. I actually in effect did that because 80% the time people who wanted to play didn't have change (I got it five years ago) so I always had quarters around, maybe just not right by the machine.  5. As an example, Over the years it's mostly friends kids who want to play. I had a very precocious 9 year old once come over with his $20 of money truly expecting to get the jackpot. He was heartbroken when he didn't win (I might have given it to him since he was so cute) but I gave him a $20 silver certificate my step grandma had given me (acquired ny dubious means no doubt) and that kid was thrilled. so I always, always give people money back if they ask. I never intended to profit off the machine. No one has ever made a big deal of it before (save the 9 year old). Edit10: this dude wins the comments, for all time: >I bet u look like jared fogle or some shit \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 Edit 11: sooooo the plot thickens, thank you to some very helpful people who own slot machines who DM'ed who were also able to suggest experts in my area, I was able to call a local person who works on antique slot machines. My slot machine is highly customized but it's based around a pretty well known model from that era (don't want to say exactly because only a few of them exist anymore) and he said I could tell right away if the machine was broken or had been tampered with. In my very, very, very amateur job of checking it over it does appear that this little piece is either broken or misplaced. So it looks like this piece of shit guest actually broke my machine to steal my money. There wasn't a jackpot at all. I don't have confirmation of this until the repair guy is able to come later this week but it looks like that's what happened. The guy said there's an outside chance that if that piece was broken or tampered with that it was an accident but he wouldn't bet on it.  I still don't care if I'm YTA till the cows come home, posting here has probably allowed me to get to the bottom of this. And fuck that guy. Edit 12: well the amazing and level headed moderators of this sub just ever so politely informed me that I will not be allowed to update this post. So the short story is the winner almost certainly was hitting the machine and caused the jackpot to spill out. So had I been a real casino I would have enacted the malfunction voids all pays and plays clause. So yeah, I was totally in the right. Fuck this sub. Fuck the moderators. And fuck those of you on your stupid high horse. Most of you however were cool.",

        "selftext": " My M30 brother in law M20 Sean moved in with me and his sister after my father in law passed away few months ago. He is the private type and keeps to himself. He goes out and never say where he's going or how long he'll be out, eats at random times during the day, wears earpuds while me and the kids are sitting with him. See, all of these are uncool behaviors and a bad influence on my children. I've already talked to Sean about certain house rules I have and how he was violating them maybe because he didn't but now he knows and still nothing's changed. Last night, he came home late at around 10pm. I wasn't thrilled with that because he knew the rules but he said that he was an adult and I shouldn't be policing him but it's not about that, it's about the fact that he's repeatedly disrespected the homeowner and the rules...So I told him this: If he won't respect the rules which are: Being home at 8, not eating at random times, and not using his electronics just like my kids aren't allowed when the family is gathered to spend time together. He ranted about how he wasn't a child, my child and called me unreasonable to treat him this way just because he lives under my roof, I told him it's not hard to show respect really but my wife went off asking what was wrong with me to be giving Sean who's still grieving, ultimatums and treating him like a child. I explained to her that I'm just making sure the kids won't be influenced by her brother's reckless behavior and she laughed asking if I think Sean being on his phone was reckless but that is besides the point. She called me a control freak and told me to get off her brother's back and leave him alone. I replied that she's just saying this because he's her brother but she said I overstepped and should back off and stop trying to control her adult brother. I asked her if she was happy with him coming home late and she said she was sick of arguing then went upstairs. AITA here?",

        "selftext": "Throwaway account. I (40F) am significantly older than my sister, 25F. As such, after she was born, I was repeatedly looked over and parentified by my parents in favor of her. Examples of this include giving my old clothes and toys to her (without my permission), rather than preserving them as a keepsake of my childhood. In short, my inner child has had to do a lot of healing over the years. I am low contact with my parents and sister, but apparently she is engaged and wants me to be a part of the wedding party. Now, I am not comfortable around children of any age. It is part of my trauma; being around them for me comes with a sense of responsibility that reminds me of the neglect I suffered at the hands of my family. My sister knows this, so I assumed with her asking me to be in the wedding, that the wedding would be childfree. During a discussion, she mentioned her fianc\u00e9\u2019s best friend\u2019s daughter would be serving as flower girl and our cousin\u2019s son would be ring bearer. I reminded her that I would not be comfortable around children and expressed my disappointment that she would invite me to be in a wedding that is not childfree. She looked sad for a second and told me that there were many young children and families that are close to her and her fiance and the day would feel \u201cincomplete\u201d without them, and if I really wasn\u2019t comfortable around children to that extent, she would understand if I am unable to attend. I was shocked that she would uninvite me in the favor of random kids and it reminded me of being thrown aside in favor of her when we were young, so I left to collect myself. I attempted to ask my parents to talk some sense into her but, surprise, surprise, they took her side. At this point, I was deeply hurt and needed an outlet, so I did something that might make me TA. I am friends with some other family members on facebook, and I made a post about how my sister was kicking me out of the wedding and that my parents were taking her side, all because of the trauma that they contributed to themselves. I didn\u2019t go into detail because I didn\u2019t think it was anyone else\u2019s business, I just wanted to vent. Now, people are apparently refusing to go to my sister\u2019s wedding unless I am reinstated as part of the wedding. She and my parents are begging me to come but still refusing to budge on the children being there, so it doesn\u2019t make much of a difference to me. I do feel bad because I didn\u2019t know that our family would refuse to come but I cannot go to an event that has that many children running around or retract my statement because I don\u2019t want the family to think I lied. AITA for refusing to go? EDIT: for those of you suggesting therapy, I am in therapy. My therapist is incredible and helped me realize how heavily my past has affected me. I have yet to discuss the facebook post with her, but we'll see what she has to say.",

        "selftext": "My future SIL is marrying my brother next summer and they are planning to have a child free wedding. I have about 3 other sisters and we all have kids as do most of my cousins at this point. Our family is kinda spread out over the country and my brother/SIL\u2019s wedding is out of state for most of us. Once I found out they wanted to make it childfree I began to lose interest in going to the wedding. I don\u2019t want to be away from my kids for a couple of days and it is just a hassle to find them living arrangements for when my husband and I are gone - especially since most of our adult family members will be at the wedding. We\u2019d have to leave the kids with some friends. However, I get that it is her wedding and her decision so I just declined to go stating that I don\u2019t want to leave my kids alone without any family to watch them. After I dropped out, my other sisters got the courage to drop out as well as they also have toddlers they didn\u2019t wan\u2019t to leave behind for a couple of days. Then my cousins began declining to come as well. Now it has become a huge deal in the family and caused a lot of drama. My brother has called me and yelled at me saying that I was the one who caused all the problems. I was firm when I told him I wasn\u2019t going to his wedding unless I could bring my kids and that all our sisters/cousins pretty much felt the same way. My parents who are paying for half of their wedding are also pissed that so many family members on our side aren\u2019t coming, they were already somewhat against the idea of a childfree wedding in the first place and have now started pressuring SIL to not make it childfree. My SIL refuses to meet in the middle and says the wedding will remain childfree, but she\u2019s also mad at all of us for not coming. She also still expects my parents to help pay for it, which I doubt they\u2019ll do at this point lol. I\u2019m fine with her having a childfree wedding, I just don\u2019t want to be a part of it if it means being away from my kids for days. AITA Edit: People keep asking why I'm mostly talking about my SIL and not my brother in the post. I know for a fact my brother was okay with having kids at the wedding, its the norm in our family and he loves his nieces/nephews. It's my SIL who wants this to be a childfree thing against the wishes of like 95% of our family and still have my parents foot the bill. My brother is just supporting her to make her happy. Edit: She has an entire 4 day itinerary planned with like 6 events that she expects to all be childfree. Are all of us with toddlers and kids supposed to swing back and forth from hiding our kids in hotels with random sitters to all the wedding activities just to keep my psycho SIL happy? And then PAY for it because she sure AF won't since our kids are our problems as she's stated to my face. ",

        "selftext": "My son is 18, He is going to be attending community college and is living with me, my husband and his 2 younger half sisters. The other day I found out that he found and accepted a job without telling me. I was upset with him about it and the reason for that is that first of all, he should've told me since we live in the same house and also, and more importantly now I'm left without someone to stay with the girls from 3 to 8 where my shift start-ends. my son is usually the one to stay home with the girls and his new job is during these hours so one way or another we are impacted. He told me his friend found him this job and it just happened - but I don't think it did because he knew he had to give up staying with his sisters while I work. my husband travels most of the time (he's a pilot) and paid child care is a no for me. My son said I shouldn't be surprised by him trying to work to save money to be able to pay for himself but that is just absurd since he literally lives with us without having to pay for anything except for his own entertainment. He said he needed the job and he wasn't reallistically going to stay and watch his sisters for days on end especially he doesn't get paid for it. We kept arguing and my husband got involved and he too was upset saying that my son had no respect for us. my son basically had a like it or not attitude with us and kept refusing to discuss this wirh us saying we have no right to be upset with him and should just accept it. but I'm just...I think that he's being inconsiderate of my husband's and I's struggle to provide for the family as a whole. this should mean something to him but he acted selfishly. ETA okay, it seems that I did not mention the reason why the babysitter option isn't ideal and is because my daughters don't want a babysitter. they're both dealing with some issues and are unconfortable being with a stranger at home. besides that my son decided to stay with them and we didn't ask him or anything. ETA Okay, some of you here are implying or suggesting that I'm making my son to be the girls' babysitter but that is in fact not true. He doesn't do much for them, just stays home with them while he studies or plays video games. He adores his sisters and only stays with them when he wants to. otherwise we wouldn't force him. Also, my husband said the girls are too young for therapy and I agree with him on that.",

        "selftext": "My wife and I have a six month old baby girl. She's mostly a SAHM, she works two half days a week and her sister watches the baby. I work full time and go to school one day a week. We've always had an arrangement where she takes care of the household duties (cooking, cleaning, and now baby care) while I happily support her monetarily. Honestly, we are both living our dream life and my wife does an absolutely spectacular job taking care of me and our little one. On the weekends, we share baby duty. We usually make sure each of us gets our own alone time to do whatever we want. However, our girl has hit a bit of a sleep regression, waking up every two hours--since my wife breast feeds, she's always taken care of the baby full time overnight. She's a light sleeper and unfortunately has insomnia, whereas I am a deep sleeper and wouldn't wake up for baby cries anyways . Recently my wife has been asking me to wake up with the baby both days on the weekends so she can get an extra hour of sleep. Baby wakes up around 7am. I get the baby dressed and take over for that hour. But sometimes, I want to be the one that gets to sleep in an extra hour. I brought this up to her and she says while she's happy to let me nap during the day, she really needs that hour bc she can't nap like I can. We got into an argument about it, and she said I'm being very insensitive when I know she is very exhausted and cant nap during the day and she struggles going back to sleep every time the baby wakes up. But I'm exhausted too, work wears me out, and school days are long... and I sometimes want the hour in the morning. I don't want to spend my off time napping, I want to play videogames and chill out. I've gotten mixed opinions on who is in the wrong here, or if there even is anyone in the wrong. AITA for asking us to share mornings off for sleep?",

Came back unprompted & hugged her. She said \u201coh good bc I was going to be sad\u201d. W my fianc\u00e9\u2019s, aunt\u2019s &bestfriend\u2019s edits, I sent her this: (Summed up):\u201cWe\u2019re teaching 3yo that he\u2019s in control of his own body & self-defined boundaries regardless of how it makes someone feel. If he\u2019s trying to make someone upset on purpose, that\u2019s a different story. We don\u2019t want him to go against his boundaries to make someone feel better. I\u2019m sure you just want to show he\u2019s important to you but we\u2019d appreciate it if you could show it in a different way.\u201d FMIL: \u201cOP, I\u2019d appreciate you not sending me these kinds of messages and we have these conversations in person. Thank you\u201d OP: \u201cI don\u2019t really see a difference to be honest. I would\u2019ve said the same things in person. I didn\u2019t see this topic as one that needs to be discussed too much. If you have a response I\u2019m obviously open to hearing it, but it won\u2019t change the fact that saying things that could make my kids feel guilty & responsible for other\u2019s feelings will be accepted. Again, you can show that you care for the boys but not in ways that make them feel bad.\u201d FMIL: \u201cBc having adult conversation via text I believe are pretty cowardess. When you address me or any other adult, via text, it\u2019s not really appropriate, so I will end this conversation with if you can't talk things over with me instead of telling me what not to do then that in itself is a problem. So I'm done.\u201d OP: \u201cAgain, I would say the same words to you in person, nothing cowardess about the method I choose to say these words. The reason I didn\u2019t see it made sense to do it in person is bc I\u2019m essentially asking you a favor & it\u2019s your choice to acknowledge it or not. I wasn\u2019t looking for a debate about it, just asking that you please not make certain comments to my babies.\u201d I\u2019m alright if she\u2019d prefer me to discuss something like this in person, but why ignore my initial message? Seems like blameshifting/diverting to me. She then went to my fianc\u00e9 & txted him \u201cso by now I\u2019m sure \u201cOP\u201d told you she was messaging me, if you guys have something you need to say to me just say it\u201d. They had a 30min phone call & my fianc\u00e9 told me she said: - she\u2019s already distanced herself from coming over & she\u2019ll distance herself more if she has to- it\u2019s not something she was doing intentionally (I never said it was intentional, just bringing her attention to this and potential repercussions) Chose to message her bc I\u2019m HORRIBLE at having deep/stressful convos in person (I have ADHD so can\u2019t process what I want to say & what other person is said & formulate responses,etc) also this is a boundary so not rly up for discussion or debate.

        "selftext": "This situation is a bit of a mess. I'll just mention the relevent conflict at hand. So My wife Liz and I have been married for 7 years. we have preschool age kids, and because we currently live in the same city as my parents. Mom would take the kids while my wife and I work. Liz is the one with a much larger income, she got an even better job opportunity that is requiring us to move to another city. I agreed since I could easily find a job in my field in the city we're moving to. but after my family heard we were selling the house to move, hell broke loose. Sunday, mom and Liz got into a huge fight because Liz told mom we'll move away and hire a babysitter for the kids so she's no longer needed. mom said she doesn't want her grandkids moving away, even said we should let the kids live at her house while we move. Liz laughed at her and mom lost it basically saying that Liz was an ungrateful witch and that her grandkids moving will only happen over her dead body. they began exchanging harsher words and Liz snapped and told mom to butt out of private matters that don't concern her. and said that she had no right to decide things regarding the kids. Mom firmly told her she was dead wrong and proceeded to tell her that she, as an involved grandmother, knows her rights and she will be taking Liz and me to court to ensure she still gets to see her grankids. Liz was in shock, she looked to the left and saw me sitting there not saying or doing anything. She told me to check my mom but I told her she was being unfair to mom and that mom had to feel upset because she will no longer be able to see her grandchildren - I honestly told Liz that she was a bit selfish to not consider my mom's feelings and her crucial presence in the kids life first. Liz started arguing with me saying she couldn't believe I didn't stand behind her and defend her after hearing mom saying she'd get the court involved. I said mom was upset and can not be blamed for her reaction. Liz started yelling at me calling me unsupportive and an enabler then went home with the kids, insisting my family is MY problem and I should handle it although this whole moving thing was her idea. Situation hasn't been resolved and Liz and mom are getting more intense in their fights. I choose to stay out of it because both have valid arguments but Liz has called me awful for not siding with her after seeing how mom spoke to her and being okay with the fact that mom was willing to cause us issues in court. AITA? I get that Liz wants my support but I feel like mom has been punished through no fault of her own after being a loving grandmother to my kids.",

        "selftext": "My son (24M) and his girlfriend (24F) have only been together for 6 months, and she is apparently 4 months pregnant with his baby. They have actually been friends since high school, and so my husband and I have known her for a few years as well.  She is a lovely girl, but honestly she is not someone I had hoped would be the mother to my first grandchild. First of all, she is a recovering drug addict and alcoholic, and while she says she has been clean for 3 years, a relapse is always possible. She only finished high school with her GED, and she now works as a waitress full time. Her parents died years ago, so she is largely on her own. Our family is considerably better off, and my son is joining his father's business, meaning his salary will be quite high and will only continue to grow.  Since my son first told us she is pregnant, it can't escape my mind that he may not really he the father, and that she picked him out of potential others because he would be the best in terms of support.  My son is pushing us to help her with some of her pregnancy expenses, and I told him we would under the condition that she get a paternity test first. He completely blew up at that, accusing us of disliking her (untrue) and not wanting to he grandparents (also untrue). He says he loves her and trusts her and that he can't wait to meet his baby. I get that, but I think he's being idealistic. If he wants our support, we want a paternity test first. If the baby is truly his then we would be happy to welcome her into our family and we would be happy to help her out. AITA? Edit: there are 7k replies to this post, and over 200 private messages in my inbox that I can't reply to. It's a pretty even mix of YTA and NTA, so clearly the only thing everyone can agree with is that it's complicated. I've gotten messages to kill myself, I've gotten messages calling my son an idiot, and I have gotten messages from the MGTOW subreddit telling me that the girlfriend is clearly a lying sociopath. I have also gotten a lot of messages from men who found out their child wasn't theirs after several years, who wish they had found out sooner.  It's a lot to read, and a lot to think about. Many people have called out my attitude towards this girl and I'll be honest, it is making me think.",

She is a freshman and has been with her boyfriend Steve for 3 years. Steve is really a great kid, but since money is a bit tighter in his family, he is doing 2 years at junior college while working to save up for the school my daughter attends. We have never taken him on a trip, but since he says money is right, we decided to bring him with on our visit to see our daughter. He visited her once on his own back in the fall, but due to his finances he wouldn\u2019t be able to afford another trip this school year. He was over the moon when we invited him.  We don\u2019t want him to pay for a single thing. His flight, his hotel room (he will be sharing with our son, they get along really well) and his food and drink will all be paid for by us. And really we are glad to do it. We\u2019ve also never really had a disagreement with Steve until now.  When speaking to my daughter about plans, the hotel came up. This is when I found out that my daughters dorm roommate is out of town that weekend. And she plans to have Steve stay in her dorm with her while we visit. I told her absolutely not. I said what they do when we aren\u2019t there is their business, but since we are going to be there and funding this whole trip, he will be staying at the hotel. Call my husband and I old school, or traditionalists, but we are Christians. And the idea of them staying together on our visit makes us uncomfortable. We think we are being rather generous to take him in the first place.  The word got back to Steve and he actually called me and asked why he couldn\u2019t stay with our daughter. I explained my reasons above and he got irate. He tried to pull the \u201cadult\u201d card. I said Steve,  here is the deal. If you wanna stay with her, that\u2019s fine. You will still be welcome to tag along with our family. But there will be separate checks on every meal. And he could figure out his own way there. He said we know he can\u2019t afford that. And I said all we ask is that you sleep at the hotel. He agreed but now my daughter is saying we embarrassed him and he\u2019s thinking of not coming.",

I was working in a bar to make money while I explored his city.  When I got pregnant he lost interest really quickly. I understood but I am pro choice. And I chose not to terminate.  I went home and had my son. I also made sure to get child support. He could afford it. He did fight it though. I had to prove paternity and everything.  Through that his parents found out. They are well off. They have met my son and they truly do seem to love him. They have provided gifts for his birthday and Christmas. They helped me with extra money so I could complete my university without going into debt. They have taken us on vacation with them so they could spend time with him. They aren't my biggest fans but we are cordial to each other.  Three months ago my son's father passed away. He got drunk at his bachelor party, tripped on the sidewalk, and hit his head. And that was all she wrote.  My son and I attended the funeral. We spent a week in that city so his grandparents could see him.  They approached me with an offer. They had no other children or grandchildren. Their son was only 28 so he had lots of time to provide them legitimate kids (they did not say this I'm just assuming) so they never thought about my son's name.  They said that if I changed his surname to theirs legally they would make him their primary heir. I think this is dumb. He is their only grandchild and they would deny him an inheritance because of his last name?  I said I would consider it, to be polite, and have left it at that. I actually have a pretty good life as it is. My family has been very supportive. And because of the whole court thing my son's father had to have life insurance with him as the beneficiary.  Would it be nice for my kid to get a big sum of money. Yes. Do I want him to have the surname of a man who didn't want him, see him, or love him? No.  I have been talking to my family about it and a few of them think I'm being an asshole for giving up.this kind of money for my son. It is generational wealth and I'm making the decision based on emotion. I think they are assholes for thinking money is the only thing that matters.  I think I will tell my son's grandparents that they can talk to him about it when he is 16. He will be old enough to understand the implications but young enough not to be tied professionally to his last name.",

However, I did NOT ask for this and honestly I freaking hate the color as it does not match anything in my place and it's also too big. I gave it to my friend who liked it and was moving to a different state. My boyfriend then got me a cute black standmixer that fit into my apartment a lot better so that's what I have. My dad was over last night and he noticed that the grey standmixer was gone and replaced by the black one. He asked where it was and I told him the truth (namely, that I thought the grey was ugly so I gave it to my friend and my boyfriend got me the black one instead). My dad was shocked and said the grey standmixer had cost a lot and that he thought I would have liked it so that's why he gave it to me as a present. Maybe here's where I'm the AH: I said if he would have been more observant, he would have known that I absolutely hate the color grey (it's my least favorite color) and everyone in my life who knows me knows that. I honestly wasn't trying to be rude, I was just stating a fact. But my mom called me today and told me I really hurt my dad and need to apologize for throwing away a thoughtful birthday gift my dad had put a lot of money and thought into. I don't think that's necessary, I think after my dad gave me the standmixer, it became mine and I could do anything with it. And I didn't throw it away, I gave it to a friend. So AITA? edit: okay so clearly I'm the asshole. I'll apologize to my dad. I didn't think it was such a big deal. But clearly I'm wrong. To explain some things: 1) I didn't say the observant comment to hurt him, he kept saying he picked out grey because it matches everything (which it does not) so that's why I elaborated on me hating grey 2) literally everyone I'm close with (except my dad I guess) knows I HATE grey. It's almost a running joke at this point 3) my friend is really into cooking/baking and I wanted to give her a moving-away gift, she's not just some rando person I gave it to",

I apologized and said the most convenient thing for me was to come here with Peanut.  He told me to fuck off and not to be a lazy pet owner. Then he stormed off. It was a bit of a scene.

The other day my 12 yo stepson fell off the stairs and injured his anckle, his dad and I had to get him to the hospital and needed someone to stay with the kids while we were there. My boyfriend told my son to skip workday and stay with and watch his stepbrothers. When we returned, My son asked my boyfriend to pay him for babysitting his kids I admit my son doesn't have the best relationship with his stepdad or stepsiblings but My boyfriend and I were shocked by this. My son explained that he had to skip a workday which cost him to lose money and asked my boyfriend to pay him for his time. My boyfriend scolded him harshly and told him that staying home with his stepbrothers isn't babysitting and he deserves no money for it. plus that skipping one day of work won't do much harm. but my son disagreed and kept arguing with my boyfriend saying his stepbrothers aren't his responsibility. My boyfriend ended up punishing him and taking away all his electronics as well as cancelling his birthday months away. My son fought back talking about how unfair this was and asked me to get involved. I sided with my boyfriend because I really did not appreciate how my son used this family emergency to his advantage and thought he'd get money out of helping family out. My son didn't like where I stood in this conflict and accused me of favoring my stepkids to stay on my boyfriend's good side while ignoring the mistreatment towards him. I cut the argument and he's become silent eversince. even refused to eat with us or sit with us. AITA for agreeing with my boyfriend to punish my son?",

She chose a seafood restaurant that we'd never been to. In looking over the menu I saw that the vast majority of the dishes contained shellfish. There were a few fish entrees, as well as some surf and turf. But there were only a couple of non-seafood dishes. Our son (15m) is deathly allergic to shellfish. He also can't stand fish. There were only a couple of dishes there that he could actually eat. I didn't want to take him there because I knew that he wouldn't really enjoy his meal and I was worried about cross contamination. I told my daughter that this restaurant wouldn't work and that she would have to pick out a different one. My son said that he would be fine just staying home; that we could use the money that we would have spent on his meal to just order him a pizza instead. My husband also insisted that since it was our daughter's birthday that she should be able to choose the restaurant, and that our son would be fine home alone with pizza and videogames. But here's the thing; we can only afford to go out as a family every so often. When we splurge on a restaurant meal, I want BOTH of our children there. I insisted and my daughter chose a different place and we had a nice meal AS A FAMILY. But she is still a little salty that she didn't get to have her first choice of restaurants. Most people I've asked say I'm wrong. But, again, we can only afford to go out every so often. Is it so wrong that I wanted to do it as a family? My daughter still had a nice birthday meal. ",

It was an entire month of her leaving the house right after getting home from work, spending some time with the cat, then going straight to her boyfriend\u2019s. Most nights she doesn\u2019t even sleep here.  She was starting to leave when i asked her if she was going to her boyfriend\u2019s. She said yes, then grabbed her keys. I stopped her and said we really needed to talk about her constantly at her boyfriend\u2019s. She said \u201cwhat is there to talk about?\u201d I told her that I didn\u2019t appreciate her going there almost everyday if she was going to live here and that there needs to be boundaries.  My friend said how she is there every night that she has her kid, and that she only leaves when she doesnt because that\u2019s the only time she can see him. She stated that she would invite him here but she wants to be courteous to myself and my son, so she just goes over there and ends up staying the night so that she isn\u2019t coming through the door very late when my son is sleeping. She asked if this was about her leaving the cat there some days, and mentioned that this was not something I told her would be an issue when establishing house rules I told her it wasn\u2019t about the cat, it was about her never or hardly being here for days at a time, when she lives here. She said she wasn\u2019t gonna just not see her boyfriend and didn\u2019t understand the issue then walked away. This made me feel confused and now i\u2019m wondering if i might be wrong? AITA?

To make sure we gave everyone enough time we got invitations ready 2 weeks in advance and I had my son pass them out Friday. We invited every one in his class (he goes to a small private school so there were only 15 kids to invite). Except for one child well call david.  The school my son goes to has a program for special needs kids where they are put into a normal class once a week. David is a high functioning autistic child who was put in my sons class to help him socialize and to help the other kids learn to not discriminate against special needs people. From what I know about him and his mother they are just doing their best, and I have nothing against either of them. However, there have been incidents with david before. Last year through friends I had heard that David had a meltdown at another party he was invited to. I don't know if I believe it but parents who were there say that it was because he wanted to open presents like the birthday boy and when told no freaked out. There are other logistical problems as well (The party will be in a loud arcade) so in the end I decided to not invite david.  Well, after my son passed the invitations word spread around that we had excluded the special needs child in his class. This got back to davids mother who called me last night and confronted me about this. She told me that I am awful for excluding her son and that i'm teaching my son to discriminate. When I brought up the logistics and the past incident she told me that i'm an asshole for assuming what her son can and cant do before hanging up. I woke up this morning to a passive aggressive post by her and many other parents are siding with her.  I just want my son to have a good party and didn't mean anything by this. AITA?",

Note that it was purchased solely by me, my wife did not help save for it (I started saving for it before I even met here) and it's in my name. When my parents threw us a party for this happy ocassion, mom asked for a copy of the key in case of an emergency. I let her have it which made my wife upset. She didn't say anything at the time but she waited til we were alone and started arguing with me saying I shouldn't have let my mother have a copy of the key. I said why?! Since my mother is known to respect privacy and is a very trusted member in the family. She said that she does not feel comfortable with the idea of someone else, who's not a resident to have a copy of the key. She also brought up how my mother didn't pay a penny towards the house so this should disqualify her from getting the key. I said it was not a big deal but she kept presisting saying I need to take the key back. Quite frankly, this had me fuming. I pointed out that I'm the one who bought the house and it's my decision to decide who gets to have a copy of the key end of story. She screamed at me saying that technically she did contribute towards the house savings back when she used to pay for our rent and daily expenses while I saved money. I told her that she was acting as if I put my mom's name on the title which's ridiculous but she said that I have no respect for her opiniins and keep undermining her input. We've been going back and forth on it since then. She's now letting me know that if I don't take the key back then she'll do it herself. I think she's being irrational and unreasonable acting like that over a copy of the house key. This decision I made could save us in case of an emergency but she kept downplaying it. E.T.A I think it's crucial to mention that there's no conflict between my mother and my wife. They're on near perfect terms, alright? I thought that I've already established that above.",

I recently got back to work and since I work nightshifts, I had to get the kids a babysitter (they're at school during the day and my sister stays with them) I was able to find a babysitter with the help of a co worker (actually they're related) and things have been going pretty well except for few days ago. The babysitter called me while I was at work to tell me that my 9 year old daughter broke her glasses, I got home, heard both sides of the story and came to a conclusion that it was in fact an accident. but the babysitter said my daughter broke them intentionally after she refused to let her outside late in the evening. I asked my 11 year old daughter and she said the babysitter's story is accurate but since she and her sister have a beef then, I figured she lied to set her sister up. my 9 year old daughter cried and said she didn't mean it and it was an accident. I apologized to the babysitter for the misunderstanding but she insisted there was no misunderstanding and then asked me to pay her for a pair of new glasses. I was taken aback by her request and told her I thought we talked this out and rolled it out as an accident but she insisted it wasn't an accident. I apologized but refused and said it was unfair to expect me to pay, especially since she didn't pay attention to keep her glasses safe regardless of wether it was an accident or not. The babysitter argued with me then started crying swearing that my daughter broke them to get back at her. My 11 year old daughter sided with her but my 9 year old said she is only siding with the babysitter for her own benefits. The girls started fighting and I ended up telling the babysitter to leave. she got my co worker involved and she said I should take responsibility and pay the babysitter for new glasses since she can not afford them being a broke college student and in need for glasses. I apologized but refused to pay, my co worker got upset and shamed me for condoning my younger daughter's actions and treating the babysitter poorly when she's the victim in this situation. It's been days and the babysitter is still wanting me to pay for new glasses but I feel like she's trying to use the fact that I'm in dire need of help and is hoping to get extra money out of my pocket.",

We've now set a date for this coming August and as we get closer more and more thoughts keep coming to me about how it should go. My biggest issue is that Kevin's best man is no longer his best man and is now his best woman. Kevin and Amy(MTF26) have been friends for a little over a decade and when they first met up until two years ago when our wedding was supposed to happen Amy identified as a man. Kevin and Amy have always had a very close almost sibling like relationship, Kevin had been kicked out by his mom at 17 and met Amy at work shortly after. She's been very close with him and he's told me multiple times that she is the closest thing he has to any family. Initially Amy had planned to not come out to Kevin until after the wedding but after finding out that the wedding was going to be delayed she came out to him. Without consulting me Kevin told her that he was fine with all of that and that if she was at a stage were she'd like to wear a dress when our wedding happened that he would find her a dress that matched the colors he had for his groomsmen. Amy has been medically transitioning for about a year or less now and Kevin told me that we need to find her a dress. I don't have a problem with Amy and I understand how close she is to Kevin but our wedding is largely for my very traditional family. Kevin has often said that this wedding isn't that important to him and that the only reason he's doing it is because it's important to me and my family. I know that my family would have a lot of issue with Amy which Im sure would bring a lot of unwanted or outright rude attention towards her. For this reason I've asked my fiance to choose someone else to be his best man and request that Amy attend as just a guest. This has lead to a large fight between the two of us with Kevin threatening to cancel the wedding if Amy can't be part of the wedding party because he wants someone from his family in it. Im trying to get him to understand the issues this will cause but I'm not sure he gets it. AITA?",

        "selftext": "I (27m) have been living with my girlfriend (29f) for several months now. For the most part things are really good and I plan to propose soon and hopefully have at least a couple of kids with her. However we've run up against a conflict. She's an absolute morning person. I hate mornings. By the time I force myself out of bed in the morning and into the shower she's already been up for at least 30 minutes--even though she has to be at work later than I do--and is at the stove making breakfast. She likes a huge breakfast in the morning. She usually has eggs, either French toast or pancakes, hashbrowns or breakfast potatoes, and sausage or bacon. Sometimes on weekends it's ham or steak. She eats almost nothing for lunch and usually has a smallish dinner but she loves a huge breakfast. Meanwhile I only ever have cold cereal for breakfast, or MAYBE if I'm feeling really ambitious some instant oatmeal and orange juice. I only even start to come alive halfway through my second cup of coffee and definitely don't feel like cooking in the morning. However my girlfriend obviously does. So recently I asked her if she'd start making breakfast for me, too. She asked if we were going to trade off and if I'd sometimes make breakfast for her, too. I told her no but reminded her that I do often make dinner for her. She said that since we trade off making dinner we should trade off making breakfast, too. I told her that there is no way I'll ever be able to muster that kind of energy first thing in the morning, but that since she obviously can that she should just make me breakfast too. I said that it would take next to no extra effort on her part to throw in a couple more eggs, strips of bacon, an extra portion of hashbrowns, etc since she's already doing it for herself, anyway. But it started a fight, with her saying that it wasn't fair for me to expect her to think of me in the morning since I don't do the same for her. She seems to think that her making breakfast for me should figure into our division of labor and that I should do something extra in return. But I think that since she makes a huge breakfast for herself every morning anyway that throwing an extra portion of whatever she's making on for me would take next-to no effort on her part, so why should I have to do more for her in return than I already do?",

        "selftext": "Throwaway My (M39) friend (M38)  recently got a service dog, its a diabetic alert dog.  The issue arises in that he wants to bring it to my house when I host hangouts/parties.  I'm not much of a dog person and really don't want it at my house.  It is a breed that sheds and I don't want to have to deal with dog hair in my house.  Also my kids regularly play in our yard and I don't want them to encounter dog poop and pee.  I've spend the last 10 years in this house turning it into a place my friends, family and I could hang out.  I have a pool, I built a bar in my basement, those types of upgrades.  I offered to meet out at a restaurant or someone else's place and host less, but my house is the preferred destination among everyone else.  I have amenities that others don't and there are no expensive food and bar tabs at my place.  I host a lot during football season and other major sporting events, with some general hangouts in between. I told my friend that his dog wasn't welcome.  I offered to pay for a monitoring device he can use while at my house, but he didn't take that offer well.  He let me know he wasn't happy and recently missed our Super Bowl get together.  AITA?",

        "selftext": "My 12-year old niece is really into arts and crafts, and recently got into crocheting. Before Christmas, she told me that she had a surprise gift for me, and seemed really excited about it. I told her I was really looking forward to it as well, and prepared her gift myself (which was actually art supplies).  On Christmas when we had our family gathering, she brought me her gift, and was super excited for me to open it. When I opened it, I saw a crocheted animal, but if I'm being honest, it looked REALLY REALLY bad. To give you an idea of what it looked like, imagine something from r/badtaxidermy but in crochet form. I couldn't help but burst out laughing, and I couldn't stop laughing no matter how hard I tried to suppress it, so I had to excuse myself to go to the washroom, where I locked myself for nearly 10 minutes.  When I came out, my niece was in tears with her parents trying to console her, and I apologized profusely and told her that I really liked her gift, but she kept crying and shouted at me, calling me a liar and that she sucked at art.  My niece avoided me for the vast majority of the party after that. I tried to make her feel better by displaying her gift on my living room cabinet, but my wife pulled me aside later in the day and told me to take it down after the party because it was in her words, really ugly and made her uncomfortable. Surprisingly, all the adults was very understanding of my situation, but I feel really bad because I feel like I destroyed my niece's confidence, and I'm not sure how I can make it up to her.",

        "selftext": "I (M26) am a second generation French immigrant to the US. I speak French and most of my family lives in France, so I try to make a trip back to France once or twice a year. I have been dating an American girl (F24) for two years now. My girlfriend does not speak French at all. The actual events in question happened this winter. I usually go to France around Christmas time. The most recent Christmas, my girlfriend wanted to come with me. I said sure as she had never been to France before and we'd been dating almost two years so it seemed reasonable.  My family comes from the South West, but I also have family in Paris so we stopped in Paris first. My gf wanted to eat at a fancy French restaurant while we were there, something with Michelin stars. Expensive, but not really a problem since I make pretty good money. We made a reservation for a good restaurant, not the best but still good. We had to make it months in advance because it's a restaurant that's high in demand. As a very upscale restaurant, there was also a dress code and things like that. We showed up and everything was fine at first. They took our coats, we sat down, the restaurant was beautiful, etc. The waiter then gave us our menu. I had to do all the communication as my gf doesn't speak French. I was showing my gf something on my menu and she noticed that mine had prices and hers didn't. I had completely forgotten about this tradition because it's just not common at all in the US. She asked me why mine had prices but not hers. I explained to her that it was just a tradition in many upscale French restaurants. She called it sexist and said it was ridiculous. I told her that it's just the way it is in these kinds of places, and that we shouldn't have come here if she was upset by this. She wanted me to ask for a menu with prices for her. I refused because we already had the prices and I didn't want to make a scene. She demanded that I confront a waiter about it or she would walk out. I called her bluff and she ended up staying, but didn't talk to me for the whole meal, which was delicious by the way. We've been back home for several months but she keeps bringing it up. I'm honestly considering ending the relationship over this because she will not stop talking about. She keeps accusing me of being sexist (I'm not) and has been making ridiculous comparisons. AITA?",

        "selftext": "Throwaway because reasons...My boyfriend (40M) and I (33F) have been together for five years and are trying to organize our next holiday. He's settled on a destination and so excited at the idea of a family trip. We're looking at flights that will likely be at least 9 hours long with business class flights, resort stay, and plenty of experiences. He makes significantly more than me but we will split the cost of the holiday 50/50 including my child's costs. The problem is he does not want to let my child (13) on to the same class on the plane as us.He thinks that my child should be grateful to be getting an international trip and just enjoy the movies and whatever other amenities there are on the flight. That they can pop up and visit us whenever in business class and that it's not worth the extra cost, even if he were a millionaire. I feel like it's weird to sit apart from my child for a 9+ hour flight, even if they're comfortable enough on a plane and I'd probably prefer to downgrade my flight if bf is unwilling to split that specific cost.He thinks I'm being weird for wanting to make that concession and it's not a big deal for child to fly alone. So, WIBTA or am I being a helicopter and stressing over something silly? Edit To Add: Just as a further explanation for why he's against it.   He has a view where children might not appreciate the value of business class and that his parents went on business class while he flew economy on his own. He absolutely wants to enjoy the business class for himself for the long haul on a nice plane. He's fine with me sitting in economy also or bumping up my child at my own cost, even though he disagrees morally and thinks I'm being kind of silly, he would accept it. He has spent plenty of money and time on my child, for birthdays, events and milestones. They get along well and have had very few upsets. Every now and then I've had to stick up for one or the other but I feel like that's to be expected with blended families.",

        "selftext": "We are in the process of moving into a new home. The house is more spacious then the old one but has limited rooms. It only has 3 rooms. My wife and I have 3 daughters 16yo/14yo/12yo and one son 10yo. The problem that's been tearing the family apart right now is that my 16yo daughter is refusing to share a room with her 2 sisters, She wants her 10yo brother's room. Her argument is that her brother is too young to have his own room and that she deserves more privacy and space since she's the eldest. Thing is we, as a family always give the boys their own rooms no matter the age while the girls share a room together. This method has proven to be workig cause girls naturally share while boys don't and they fight a lot.  My daughter threw a rage fit and got my wife involved. My wife called me unreasonable for thinking it's fair to make the 3 girls share one room while our son gets an entire room for himself, and he's the youngest!! So he's the one with the least privacy. I told her that it's been like this for years and just cause we're moving into a new home doesn't mean things have to change, to be honest part of me is thinking that my 16yo is doing this simply because she's against the idea of moving in the first place and is looking for excuses to not move in to the new home, my wife argued that moving our 12yo daughter with our 10yo is the best compromise, but my son won't accept this and I already know that. all I'm looking for is for everyone to be happy and comfortable and to my understanding, my daughter was fine with sharing a room with her sisters then, why Change her mind now?. My wife still sided with her and said that I should be careful because the girls are beginning to sense some sort of favoritism towards my son which isn't true at all. but it's all about what we're used to and what is the norm in the family, They're both not speaking to me and are acting somewhat hostile towards me. ETA for those who are saying I was in the wrong for buying a 3bedroom house, well our financial situation isn't the best right with everything happening in the world and real-estate prices getting higher and whatnot. Also, those who are saying I'm favoring my son, I'm not, I treat him the same as his sisters in pretty much everything and I 100% guarantee it, I accept my verdict nonetheless but still wanted to make few points clear. Thanks anyway.",

Due to limited space, no children were invited to the wedding except the bride's young nieces and nephews.  My baby was 10 months old at the time and I wasn't comfortable leaving him alone in an unfamiliar place with a stranger, which was a babysitter that my other cousins hired for their own kids. So I decided to bring him to the wedding. I wrote on the RSVP that I was bringing him but he would be sitting on my lap and I would bring my own food for him. My cousin didn't say anything so I assumed that he was OK with it. My baby cried at the ceremony but I quickly took him out of the room. At the reception I had him with me the whole time in a body carrier. He didn't make much of a fuss and I thought everything was OK.  After the wedding my aunt (groom's mom) confronted me and told me that I was rude for bringing my baby without permission. I explained that I wrote on the RSVP what I was planning to do but my cousin didn't object. She said that my cousin and his bride had a problem with it but the bride didn't want to start any drama because she doesn't know me well.  My other cousin's baby was 7 months old at the time and my aunt said that he had no problem leaving his baby with the certified babysitter and I should of done the same. And some of my cousins were upset because they thought that the groom gave me special treatment by letting me bring my baby and making them leave their kids with a babysitter. I didn't mean to start any drama. AITA?",

        "selftext": "So, I have a 20-year-old daughter who is currently living with me rent-free while she attends college. When she moved back home, we made a deal where she would cook and clean the house as a form of payment for her living here. She agreed to it, and we both thought it was fair. However, recently, she approached me and said that the cooking and cleaning are taking up too much of her time, making it hard for her to study and complete her homework. She asked if I could reduce the number of days she has to cook to give her more time for her studies. I told her that she should be grateful for the deal I offered her and that it's not that hard to do a few hours of chores compared to what many kids her age are going through. I pointed out that some of her peers are working 9-5 while going to school simultaneously, and I've given her the luxury of just handling some household chores in exchange for free housing. She ended up calling her aunt(my sister) behind my back to complain about how I'm treating her, and my sister called me, and kind of went off on me, basically saying I'm being too strict and should listen to my daughter. Here's where I'm unsure if I'm being an asshole. I want to stick to the agreement we made, but my sister's words have me questioning my stance. AITA for not wanting to change the deal we initially made? I thought it was a fair deal. Edit: Well I wasn't expecting this post to blow up. Just to address some things. For one I'm my Daughter's Father, not stepmother. Her mother is no longer with us and I'm currently single. So this isn't a Cinderella story. Two, I'm not sexist for making my daughter cook for my son's who are only children. They don't know how to cook, let alone clean themselves. Three, I'm not trying to take advantage of my daughter. As I said in my post, a lot of people her age would die to be in the position she's in right now. I'm paying for her college and all I expect back from her is a homemade meal. I appreciate the feedback, but a lot of bad assumptions were made about me so I had to clear it up. Edit 2: After reading a lot of you guy's comments, I'm leaning towards making an ultimatum with my daughter. Either she can get a job and pay some of the rent, so she no longer has to consistently cook & clean anymore or she can continue with the deal I initially offered her. To compromise a little bit, I might change some of the days she has to cook & clean, to days where she has more free time to do so. I believe if she decides to take a 9-5, she will eventually realize just how good the offer I initially made with her was. Some may think I'm being harsh, but my stance is different on that, because at her age I was going to school and I paid full rent by myself with no help from my family. So I believe this to be a fair compromise. ",

        "selftext": "So how to begin with this...I realize that on paper I am totally the asshole but when you dig deeper into my motivations I'm hoping its more of a grey area that anything else and maybe even I did the right thing.  When I was a teenager my dad bought me a classic 1972 Ford Bronco. It was my true passion and I don't recall a memory from high school that somehow doesn't involve that truck. Plus my dad and I would spend hours and hours working on it together and we went through that especially father/son rough patch when I was teenager it was always that Bronco that brought us back together. I made a huge mistake and sold the truck when I turned 19 and my dad died of a heart attack two months later so while not logical, I've always felt a karmic connection between the two events.  We had a baby in early February. she is our first and the light of my life. My wife is doing well but she's back at work and she's realized that she hates all the day cares we've tried and really wants to be a stay at home mom and plus she's still very hormonal from delivery, lack of sleep and breastfeeding so she's having a rough time and is angry a lot. I guess I need to say this.  Two weeks ago I was driving through our town's warehouse district and saw a Bronco that was pretty beat up but resembled mine. I stopped just for nostalgias sake and the owner came out and let me take a look inside. My dad and I had glued a wheat penny under the dash as sort of security measure so I just sort of checked and goddamned if it wasn't MY BRONCO!  I asked him if he'd ever consider selling it, he said actually someone was on I-25 as we spoke from Colorado to buy it for $21000. I freaked out and asked him if I could buy it right then and there for $23000. He said if I could come up with the cash, yes. I had been procrastinating setting up a 529 so I had $12000 in savings that my wife's parents had given us, I maxed out my credit card to Venmo and my mom bought down a check for $4000 and I fucking drove away in my old car. It was like a dream come true. Like a literal dream come true. It needs a lot of work I can't afford right now but it's mine. Like in my driveway mine. Again. I can't even describe what a joy this is.  My wife and her parents are furious with me. They feel I was deceptive, that a real man would have sacrificed anything and everything so my wife could go stay at home with his kids and that's setting aside that they gave us the money for a college fund. My point is my daughter is only 6 months old, we have 18 years to set up a college fund of her. But this Bronco means everything to me and if I wouldn't have acted it would have been gone forever. Now it can be that same connection between me and my kids. To me it's the literal meaning of happiness. Like I said on paper--asshole...whole story--grey area. How do you guys see it? Edit: had no idea this would go so one way. I guess I messed up. I talked with my mom and she is basically going to buy the bronco from me in order to refill the college fund and pay off the credit card. The $4k will be a gift and she\u2019s going to give me whatever I need to restore it. She\u2019s always been awesome to me and she\u2019s rather the money be spent now than wait for me and my sisters inheritance. Sorry to get everyone so mad at me, I was thinking with my emotions and acted badly edit2: are the \u201cmommy bailed you out\u201d comments really necessary ? I found a solution and it\u2019s coming from me and my sisters inheritance so it\u2019s not like I\u2019m not paying for it on my own eventually. Edit 3: my inbox is so buried I have no idea what those icons are that are where gold used to be. Does anyone know what those are ? Edit4: I\u2019m getting a 403 error whenever I try to respond, not sure what that means but I\u2019m still reading because honestly I\u2019m afraid to go home even with the great news I know my wife is going to be upset for one reason or another Edit5: does anyone know what 403 error means? I messaged the moderators but they must be busy /u/SnausageFest since you\u2019re a mod, do you know? I can\u2019t respond to any posts and get the \u201cstatus 403\u201d whenever I try. Thanks! Edit in the morning: I couldn\u2019t figure out why I was getting so many private\u2019s  but I guess this must be locked now. I didn\u2019t tell my wife that my mom bailed me out and lied and Said I found a buyer for the bronco. I\u2019ll figure out how to cross that bridge when I get there but my wife was so relieved that I \u201chad come to your senses\u201d I don\u2019t want to disappoint her. It\u2019s going to take all my lying skills to pull this one off over the next few years.",

        "selftext": "I(24F) have been dating Jay(28M) for four months. He is handsome, smart, funny, well-educated, has an awesome job, and is a sweetheart. Sunday he had a whole day planned for us. We were going to walk a nature trail and then go back to his place for dinner he was making. I was so excited because it was going to be the first time I'd be at his house. Since we were hiking he said I could bring my dog Shelby with us. He made us a roast and some vegetables for dinner. I finished my plate before Jay did and took it to the kitchen. There was still about half the roast left and it was close to Shelby's dinner time so I took half of the half of roast and some still raw vegetables from the fridge to put on a plate for Shelby. I was carrying the plate to the back door with Shelby to feed her outside and Jay asked me what I was doing. I told him feeding Shelby. Jay said something like Well that's not dog food. Jay knows I mainly feed Shelby a raw diet. I opened the door to put the plate down for Shelby and Jay got up, took the plate away from her, went to the kitchen and came back with it wrapped up in tinfoil and told me to leave. His excuse was that he made dinner for me and him, not me, him, and my dog and that I should've asked before I helped myself since he would've used his leftovers. I did leave but not before telling him that he made that meal for us so I could do with some of it as I pleased and he knew damn well how I feed Shelby. I tried talking to my friend about it later that night but she said Jay was right to be upset but this friend has never really approved of how I treat my own dog so I feel like she was probably a bit biased and the wrong person to ask. AITA for just feeding my dog like I normally would? Clarification: She does NOT get restaurant food daily, I eat out maybe 4 times a month. If what I eat is dog safe or the restaurant makes food for dogs on request, THEN I bring some home for her. Shelby's daily meals are a bit of brown rice, raw vegetables, and ground chicken hearts and beef livers. The hearts and livers are boiled just enough to kill bacteria and that is all with the approval of Shelby's vet. I asked Jay how he prepared the roast so I could know if it was safe to give her. That's also why I got her fresh, unused vegetables from the fridge. Update: I accept that Im the AH for what I said and did to Jay. Some of these responses were harsh but I see now how and why I was entitled. Thanks to people that responded to the actual issue. Others going on about her diet, thanks for the concern? but I came here to ask about Jay. Not get into a debate about dog foods. Shelby's been on her diet for 6 years and is a healthy and active puppo, that's all I and my vet need to know. As for Jay, I apologized to him and he did accept my apology but he broke it off. He said it was the last straw for him over me doing things without asking first. He has talked to me about taking things off his plate or his drink without asking before. I've tried to do better but keep slipping up. I didn't realize I was that bad about it so I'm going to work on myself for the next guy. For people that said not going to his place for 4 months was a red flag, that was my decision that he respected. I don't want to go to someone's house or them know where I live the first few months of dating and getting to know each other.",

I\u2019ve told Mia numerous times that she can just pop in whenever she wants to (she works from home) but she rarely does.  She did at the beginning but it\u2019s been happening less and less. Instead, she keeps suggesting we go out for coffee or pizza or even a drink but I don\u2019t have the time and always just tell her to come over and we\u2019ll have coffee at my place. She asked if I wanted to go out with her and her other friends for a drink last weekend but I said that no but she\u2019s welcome to come over and we\u2019ll have a few drinks at mine. She said she already had plans and it felt weird to drink when she knows there\u2019s a child around.  Honestly, I feel neglected. I feel like she put me on a back burner and doesn\u2019t want to be friends anymore. I\u2019m always available but she rarely comes over and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s fair. Today, I saw her photos from Saturday night out and I was fuming. She ditched me just so she could go and drink like she\u2019s 20 again. I felt rejected and horrible, I thought we were best friends but she clearly doesn\u2019t value me when she won\u2019t even have a few drinks with me at my house. When she finished work, she called and asked if I fancied going for coffee to town but I asked her to come over again. She said yes but before she disconnected, I heard her mumble \u201clike always.\u201d This really annoyed me. When she came over, I decided to be open about everything. And while not my proudest or most mature moment, I shouted at her that she\u2019s an awful friend m, that she barely comes over and if she doesn\u2019t want to spend time with me to just say it and stop playing around. She said she\u2019s always been accommodating but it\u2019s been 2 years and she doesn\u2019t want to spend time with me when there\u2019s always a kid, especially now when she has to watch her language (Mia likes to swear). I said that she knew I had a child and responsibilities. And she said that Tom (my partner) could take care of Ciara once in a while so I could have a time off. This felt really intrusive and I told her to mind her own business and not meddle on my marriage.  I was really angry with her and kicked her out. She called me a selfish asshole on her way out. Normally, I would expect her to call by now with apologies but she hasn\u2019t done so and I\u2019m starting to wonder was I the asshole or was she? Perhaps I was too harsh and should\u2019ve been more careful with discussing it.",

        "selftext": "Last weekend was my (26\u039c) birthday. Me and my GF of 2 years Kenzie (26F) had plans to get dinner. She came to pick me up from work and her car was packed and my best friend/his wife were in the backseat. To my surprise she planned a whole weekend away to my favorite lake, rented a sick house on the water and invited all our friends. Her sister/husband, my friends/their SO\u2019s and a few of Kenzie\u2019s friends all arrived Thursday night. It was an awesome and I was stoked for the weekend. We met thru my best childhood friend Grace (26F). Grace and kenzie were college friends and I never thought I had a chance. Kenzie is beautiful and while I\u2019m not ugly, I\u2019ve always felt like we weren\u2019t in the same league. No idea how I got her and I still don\u2019t.  Thursday night went well. Friday we swam and hung out at the house most of the day. We started drinking and playing games at night. Kenzie\u2019s sister broke out this couples game. Basically you pick one person in the relationship that fits the description or it has prompts to engage in debates between couples. Kenzie was pretty drunk by now because she\u2019s a lightweight and was drinking most of the night.  It was fun till a question of \u201cWhat originally attracted you to your SO\u201d. Kenzie blurted out \u201che was safe. And I knew he wouldn\u2019t cheat or leave me.\u201d I looked at her with a face and was like \u201chuh\u201d. She then says \u201cyeah you seemed nice enough and after my abusive ex I wanted a safer option\u201d. Things got really awakened and her sister quickly read a different card. I was really embarrassed and flustered so I said I had to pee and walked outside. I called Grace to tell her what happened (she was working and couldn\u2019t come) and she got upset. I told her I wanted to leave. She said I didn\u2019t need to take that and she would be there in the morning to get me. The night died down and kenzie tried talking to me in front of everyone but I told her we\u2019d talk about it another time. I decided to pack my bags and sleep on the couch. And before anyone woke up I left. I texted Kenzie and told her that I didn\u2019t want to fight about what happened and ruin everyones trip. So I was going home for the weekend and we could talk whenever she got home.  She blew my phone up all Saturday as did a few of my friends. I decided to go golfing and just turn my phone off. I just didn\u2019t want to talk to anyone. When Kenzie showed up at my place Sunday she was fuming. Saying that me leaving early ruined the whole trip. It was all anyone could talk about. And the whole vibe felt off because the birthday boy was gone. That she felt like a POS and I didn\u2019t give her a chance to explain. And she hardly even remembers what she said to begin with. She rented a boat (I love boating) and felt like I disrespected her efforts/money to put together the trip. I told her that I didn\u2019t feel like arguing so I went home to avoid the drama. Some said that it was an AH move to just bail and I should have stayed because she did put a done of effort into the trip. AITA? 8am edit: I\u2019ve had some time to cool off and we are finally gonna sit down and talk out in person what happened. I\u2019m gonna get clarity hopefully and see if this is a salvageable relationship. For everyone saying it was just the \u201csafe\u201d comment. I implore you to read the entirety of what she said. Being called \u201csafe\u201d and a \u201csafer option\u201d are two totally different things. Also the \u201cseemed nice enough\u201d comment bothered the hell out of me. She tried to speak to me immediately afterwards in front of everyone while still drunk which is why I didn\u2019t want to talk. Will provide updates when possible.",

        "selftext": "I have a close friend from college who's getting married, and she's been asking for my help to contribute to her wedding. I think it's sweet that she's thinking of me, but I don't think it's a good idea for me to help out financially.  My friend and I have been close for a few years now, and I'm happy for her. She is struggling financially, and they have asked that instead of wedding gifts, people can donate to parts of their wedding ceremony (theres a registry and everything, like \u201ctable flowers\u201d and stuff). I'm know she's trying to save as much money as possible for certain reasons unrelated to the wedding. But I just don't think it's right for me to be helping her out with the costs at this time. I'm a recent doctorate candidate (soon), am currently writing a memoir, and I dont know when I will have time to get a job - anything I give is just that much less time I can live on my own. Even if I could afford it, I don't think it's fair that I should have to help out when I know her fiance already has a job and could definitely get another, and some of his friends seem well off. I tried to explain my financial situation to my friend, but she's still asking for help, even a little. She suggested that I could contribute a much smaller amount than others, but I still don't think it's a good idea. I told her that if I was in a better financial situation I would be more than happy to help out, but right now it just isn't possible.  My friend got really mad at me and said that I was selfish, and that she expected more from me.  Our group of friends all pledged to help pay for each others weddings back in college, and she says that since she helped pay for my wedding ($550), that I should help her out, even if it's just $20. She is also threatening to tell our group of friends, just because all of them contributed to my wedding - but she completely ignores the fact that my marriage didn\u2019t last even one year. I don't want to lose her friendship, and I really don\u2019t want her to tell our friends - my financial situation is private. More importantly, I also don't want to be taken advantage of. AITA for not wanting to help pay for her wedding? ***Edit: ok, after seeing all the reactions and misunderstandings here, I talked with a couple other friends in our group and showed them the post. They sent me some money ($100) to give to our friend for her wedding. I\u2019m going to offer $5 at first and see if that is enough. Couple other points:  - My friends fianc\u00e9 agreed to purchase my ticket to fly, so giving up that money and not going is not an option - My friend did also give me a wedding gift which I returned - I do not have the money for a wedding gift, but I believe being there for her on her big day is a present itself - everyone laughs when I say \u201cmy presence is present enough\u201d so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s as negative as others see it. - I have not been accepted into a school yet, I am starting to apply for PHD programs. I\u2019m writing a memoir as a tribute and gift back for my experiences - and doing it now to prepare to become a doctor. ***Edit 2: to clarify, I understood the $100 is to be used for ALL friend weddings in our group, not just the one now. I am NOT just pocketing the money. I am saving it for when others get married and that means I have to try to ration it out, for lack of a better word. Note - there are only three people left in the group who are unmarried: my friend, one other person, and myself. ***EDIT 3: A LOT of people are asking about my memoir. I won\u2019t be sharing details here so as to not take it off topic. Anyone can DM me for more info though ***Edit 4: I offered the $5, and didn\u2019t hear back for a couple days. So today I offered $20 as a gesture of good will, without waiting to hear about the $5. She said no, and even had the audacity to tell me I didn\u2019t need to come to her wedding at all! I offered $25, then $50. Still nothing she just seemed to get more upset even when I INCREASED the amount. Idk what she expects literally more than double what she asked for, and it isn\u2019t enough?",

        "selftext": "Context: Me f26 and my husband m32 welcomed our daughter several months ago. So far we've agreed on every decision made regarding our daughter but the topic of peircing her ears came up and he said he didn't like the idea despite me explaining that 1. It's normal thing for babies and 2. It looks pretty 3. no it's not cultural we're both white but it's a great new experience imo. He said he needed time to think about it but weeks went by and he hasn't said okay yet. Mom suggested we do it behind his back and he'll then come around and see for himself that it's a good thing since he was having doubts and being indecisive. I was hasitant but I agreed and chose a day where he was out all day. Thankfully it went smoothly but when my husband got home and found out he lost his temper and went on about what a major breach of trust I just committed and how I should have never decided to do this without him fully agreeing since he's the parent too and got extra mad that I went behind his back and was being sneaky and untruthful about it. I tried to explain that first it was my mom's idea and I didn't think he'd overreact like that but he insisted that I did was not okay and that I overruled him as a parent and damaged the trust we have and also put our daughter through pain and discomfort. I had an argument with him and told him he was acting like this is just his daughter, I'm the mother and my opinion does have heavier weight than his to some degree. He got offended by that and went to stay with his mom who called and berated me for going behind her son's back and treating him as a less than when it comes to our daughter but I never understood why he thought that. He is not talking to me now. I think he's being selfish by saying he needed time to think about it and trying to stall without considering my point of view. Mom is on my side here but he and my inlaws said I screwed up for making such decision without his okay and going behind his back to get it done. AITA? Edit/ putting this out there/ My husband was aware that I had plans to get our daughter's ears peirced and we've had many many discussions about it so it wasn't like it was out of the blue and I didn't bring it up with him. I did but he kept giving me the same I need time to think about it the entire time. How long was I supposed to wait? Why he kept stalling instrad of just saying just no? He just kept stalling and putting off any further discussions/compromises that we could've had as a way maybe to get me to just abandon the whole idea.",

        "selftext": "edit: I want to clarify two things.  1. I am her dad, not sure why everyone keeps referring to me as her mother 2. Everyone keeps telling me the grade due date is actually the post date. If I was allowed to I would post the link so that you could see that the calendar literally says December 19th: Grades Due From Faculty and December 20th Grades Posted. She literally admitted to lying that they were due Sunday (today) so I'm not sure why people are so stuck on insistng I'm wrong about that   I'm 54 and daughter is 28. She is home on break from grad school getting her phd. She's only home for two weeks because she says she doesn't have any more time even though she has a month break. That's been a big thing with her lately, she is constantly to busy to do things with us or help us out even though she does have the time. I got my younger daughter a sweater and it turns out she already has it. I called my older daughter from work on Friday and told her she needed to run and exchange it for a different one. She said ok, she'd do it the next day. I said it needed to be done that day to get the best options and she said she was grading so she can't. I told her that it's not like she can't pause her grading, run out, and exchange it. She said she wasn't going to slow down her work and just said that I should do it when I got back from work that day. I said I was busy to and didn't feel like running out after a long day of work and she said neither did she. But she doesn't have a long day of work, she's sitting on her ass on her computer all day and doesn't even have scheduled hours to work, she can do it whenever she wants. Today things really kicked off because I needed her to pick up an online order for a gift for my mom, her grandma. She again used the excuse of grading (she hadn't even started working yet, it was in the morning and she was drinking coffee and having breakfast.) She said that she needs to have her grades done by today but I looked it up on the website and she has until Monday evening so I called her on her BS, and she said she had other work due on Monday so she needed to get the grading done today (but wouldn't enlighten me on what this mysterious other work is). I said well tough, this needs to be picked up today so I can wrap it and I was going into the office so I couldn't do it. She said that if I don't want to do it myself, then it will be done on her own time. I told her with that attitude she can stay somewhere else and she said happily and packed her things claiming she didn't want to stay here anyway but was only doing so because I insisted. She left her gifts and said to not expect her for the holidays and she'll go to her girlfriend's family instead. I think it's ridiculous that she is throwing a fit just because she can't constantly live like she's the only person on the planet but my wife and other daughter is now furious with me. So I figured I'd ask here because my younger daughter is always reading the stories with me. AITA or am I correct that my daughter is self centered and childish?",

        "selftext": "We came home from the hospital 5 weeks ago with our first child, a boy. For the next 4 weeks, my wife did not let any of my family visit our son. Her mother and sister came over several times a week. My wife refuses to let my family see him because she doesn't want to play host. My family understands that being a new mom is stressful and they have no expectations of being treated like proper guests. I told her it's not fair that her family can come & go as they please but my family can't even meet him. She said her family comes over to help her, which is not really true, they just hold the baby a little and if the baby isn't sleeping then I am the one taking care of him while they are here. They don't clean or anything, at most they might bring some takeout on the way over. Finally I decided I will be taking the baby to see my parents last weekend. My wife doesn't breastfeed so I got all the formula and diapers and everything I would need for a couple days and packed a bag. I thought this was a win-win because my wife could have some time to herself or come along and she would be under no pressure to host anyone. But she got mad when I told her what I would do but I told her this was happening, I am the baby's father and my family has a right to see him just as hers does. She refused to come along and said she can't believe I'm treating a new mother this way. I left on Friday evening and didn't hear anything from my wife on Saturday, but her sister & mom were over & sent a bunch of texts basically accusing me of abusing a new mother. Finally on Sunday she started sending me text after text on how I was a terrible husband, how I kidnapped her son, how a baby can't be separated from its mother, etc. It got so bad that I cut my visit short and drove home. She was very mad when I got home and refusing to speak to me. The next day when the baby was asleep I sat her down and tried to calmly explain to her that I am the FATHER of the baby so I have as much right to where he goes and who he sees as she does, we are equal parents and she needs to accept reasonable compromises when we disagree, like my family being able to see our son and she not having to host them. She called me an asshole and shouted that she gets more say because she's the one who was pregnant with him. At that point I said if she thinks that way & the accusations she texted me, I think she really needs to see a doctor and get assessed for PPD because her behavior is not normal. She called me an AH and said I was abusing my position as the earner (money was never part of any discussion). She has been giving me a near-silent treatment all week, resisting any attempts to discuss therapy, and her sister has texted me saying I should apologize to her for what I said. I told her sister that I had said absolutely nothing wrong in response to being accused of kidnapping and being a lesser parent to MY son. I am standing my ground but I need an outside perspective, AITA? EDIT: To clarify, the idea my wife might have PPD did not occur to me until after the visit with my family. EDIT 2: My wife knew of my plan to visit my family several days in advance. I planned a weekend trip because they are several hours away. EDIT 3: I want to emphasize this because people keep asking about it. **I DID NOT WANT TO SEPARATE MY SON FROM HIS MOTHER. I WANTED HER TO COME WITH US. SHE REFUSED.** I did not forcibly take my son away from her. It was her decision not to come along and her decision not to allow my family to come to her. EDIT 4: My wife is not physically handicapped from childbirth. She has been mobile and going out including a 6 hour car ride 2 weeks ago. EDIT 5: My wife refused any options involving my family coming to us. No hotel or in-town visits.",

His mom came to wait with me there but didn't speak to me because we have been having some minor disagreements. She offered me coffee but I declined politely.  Hours after the surgery, we were told only one person goes into the room for the day since he was still under anesthesia. From what I understand he woke up calling for his mom, the nurse asked for his mom to go in and she did. I was irritated and felt like all this waiting and stressing out got ignored. The nurse told me that he was still not fully awake and was repeatedly calling for his mom spontaneously, she was basically hinting that I shouldn't get worked up over a natural reaction from my husband but I couldn't help feel irked. I wanted to go home so I left 10 minutes later. His mom called saying she got out the room after I left so I could get time with him but instead I couldn't wait and went home. She said this was not okay and I flew off the handle for no reason, I said that her son acted like I wasn't there but she said that he can not be blamed for something he can't control and I'm just being unfair to him and putting blame on him because of a disagreement between her and I. I cut the conversation short after I sensed that she somehow blamed me for being unacknowledged and ignored. Her husband texted later saying I'm being hostile over nothing and that I should focus on my husband's health instead of acting petty but I don't think I did anything that qualifies as petty.",

        "selftext": " Me (F.) and My ex husband (M.) are divorced. We have a 16 yo son together Mason. I got remarried to my husband (M.) Nathan. My ex husband and I used to argue on who should get Mason for the holidays back when he was little. As he got older we started letting him decide. Last year he spend Christmas with me, Nathan and my inlaws and he complained that the experience was terrible because he said Nathan and his family had little to no accomodation for his food choices (I'm not defending them but my inlaws are quite traditional when it comes to food and a bit ignorant to what types of foods Mason eats). He also said he didn't feel as welcom as the other kids in the family and that Nathan forced him to share his personal stuff like his phone so that his stepnephews could watch christmas movies. Yesterday, during breakfast we were talking about christmas and what we were planning this year but hem out of nowhere announced that he'll be spending this Christmas with his dad at a rental christmas cottage in his favorite town. I was stunned, so was Nathan. I asked Mason when and how he agreed to this arrangement but he pointed back to what happened last christmas and said he didn't want to basically have another shitty holiday and be miserable I told him that his dad should've come to me first but he argued that he's already okayed it and so he saw no need for my opinion. We started arguing and he started complaining about me trying to ruin the experience but in response I told him that he has already ruined christmas for me and his stepdad the minhte he agreed to this arrangement. He got up and walked away after saying that I was being overdramatic. Nathan just sat there and looked down. I had a huge argument on the phone with Mason's dad and he kept giving me an attitude and laughjng and saying that I sounded pathetic. When I told him I'd have my lawyer call him, he bbackpaddeled and said he woukdn't have done this if Mason didn't like it. He urged me to drop it and let Mason have this experience or he'll resent me for missing it. Now Mason isn't speaking to me. Nathan is trying to convince him to stay with us because without him, our christmas is ruined but he won't budge from the looks of it. AITA for not dropping it as well? What I meant by why didn't his dad come to me first is that he planned to take Mason out of town which is a big deal to me. There's going to be traveling.",

I was recently informed by a young man I work with that my daughter strips at a club about 40 minutes away. I confronted her on this and she said she  didn\u2019t plan to do it after she graduated, and she needed some money. I told her then work at McDonalds, not use her body. We got into an argument, and i asked her to quit stripping and get a decent job then. She refused and said stripping was easy money, so basically I said there was no need for me to pay her car payment anymore since she is making money so easily. She got upset and said that wasn\u2019t fair, and that she doesn\u2019t make enough for that. I told her to figure it out. She told my wife about what happened, and my wife is upset by her job of choice but says it\u2019s unfair for me to stop supporting her so suddenly over an argument. I think it\u2019s perfectly fair, it\u2019s my money and my decision when to cut it off.",

I like Stephanie she has been great with my kids and makes my ex happy. My ex invited me to their wedding and I was happy for him. It was my day with the kids so it made sense for me to come was his reasoning. When I arrived at the wedding Stephanie thanked me for dropping the kids off and brushed me off. We had never had any issues before. I explained that I was going to stay for the reception and she was very upset. I was confused because I assumed she knew I would be in attendance. It turned out she didn\u2019t consider that I would actually accept the invitation. I told her that I was invited and since I took the 2 hour drive I would be staying for the entire duration. She didn\u2019t like this response. Stephanie asked me to leave and I stood my ground. She went on to complain about my dress upstaging hers. My ex and former mother in law helped her to calm down and the wedding shortly began. I thought that was the end of it, but later in private Stephanie accused me of trying to ruin her special day. She is convinced that I wanted to show off and make the wedding about my divorce. She said it was rude for me not to leave after the bride requested it because it was her special day. I told her that I am not responsible for her insecurities and once again reminded her that I have no interest in \u201dstealing\u201d my ex back.

We (my husband 28m) made a list in October and sent it out to everyone  Some rules include -up to date on ALL vaccines -if you feel anyway sick don\u2019t visit - let us know a week before hand so we can arrange a day/time- no smokers - no phone calls or visits between 7:30pm-10pm -you can only stay an hour -no picking up the baby without consent -no Adivce -no perfume/deodorant - no is no we won\u2019t explain why - no pictures to be taken or posted on social media - if you visit the first time you will be expected to give mom (me) a gift card and a gift for baby from out approved list- before you ever come no matter how many times you will be give a list of a ether food or groceries to bring with you AND a chore for a list of your choosing - no more than two visits a week per person  It\u2019s help to keep the visits to minimum and no one can complain about favouritism because everyone is treated equally. Which brings me onto my current situation my sister in law(20f)  studies in a different part of the country and is rarely home asked to visit last week before she had to go back to school, so We set up a date with link to our gift list than sent her the takeout we\u2019d like including the chores she can choose from  Sent immediately texted back saying she\u2019s broke and can she do extra chores instead,Me and my husband talked about it and came to the decision that if we bent the rules for one person everyone would want the same treatment  We told her no that we were very clear about our rules and maybe next time she could visit. She begged even said would clean the whole house because it would be June before she\u2019s would be home again and we simply texted no. She didn\u2019t reply  She left this morning and we got multiple texts for my in laws belittling us for using our child as a cash grab, my husband simply replied it was our rules and no one deserves special treatment than told his family they were on a time out and blocked them Since than my family and our friends have told us we were wrong because she is a broke collage student and they would have understood if we looked the other way once.

        "selftext": "I'll preface this by saying that my husband (Luke) M32 does not get along with my parents. You can't tell who's right or who's wrong, there's always this ongoing tension between them but can be civil enough to sit together at one table. I recently got an invitation for christmas celebration from my parents. The invitation including me and Luke but Luke thought this was somewhat rude and a disrespectful because he believes he should get his own invitation and not have his name mentioned as an extention to mine. We talked and he said he wouldn't go unless they send him a proper invitation. I called mom and asked if she could do it. She thought it was ridiculous and said that she and dad did the same with my sister and her husband. I told her it was fine but Luke can be sensitive like that and so a simple invitation in a form of a text directly to him will fix it. She got defensive and said that Luke is being ridiculous. Dad claimed that Luke is trying to pull some power move to humiliate them but I thought this was a small issue. They still thought it was ridiculous so I told them I won't attend if they don't send him a separate invitation because he won't attend if he doesn't get it. This blew up and my sister started arguing saying Luke needs to get over himself and shamed me for trying to force our parents to send him an invitation by saying I won't come if they don't. We haven't talked after that and we're waiting as of now. edit! The invitation I recieved was in a text. Luke is saying that a simple text to him will finish the conflict but my parents still think it's ridiculous and that they won't invite him since they already have. **UPDATE! I just got off the phone with my sister. She told me our parents have just disinvited me (Luke was probably already disinvited since the argument occured) from the celebration. I feel horrible but I can't argue anymore, just like I can't argue about what everybody else in the comments is saying. I admit it! Luke is the problem. He just caused me to be disinvited from the event and is blaming ME for it.**",

        "selftext": "Throwaway account  I (36 male) have a 16 year old daughter named Jane. Jane is a great kid and was really close to my mom until she passed away a year ago. My mother gave one piece of her jewelry to her children before she passed away. I was given her engagement ring.  I have been planning a proposal to my girlfriend, Laura (30 female) for about 6 months now. Jane is from my previous relationship (her mother and I were never married). I\u2019ve been dating Laura for about 5 years.  I told Jane I was going to propose. She was happy about it and asked to see the ring. I told her I\u2019d be using my mothers ring and Jane looked upset so I asked her what was wrong. She said she had assumed the ring would be hers since she is my daughter. I explained the ring was given to me and there are other heirlooms (small items like rosary beads) she can have.  For clarification I do have the money to buy a ring but the sentimental value of this ring is why I wanted to use it. Laura also helped us take care of our mom while she was sick and they were close.  I proposed to Laura with the ring and she said yes. After this happened Jane cried to her uncle (my brother) about it and he understands both points. His wife thinks I\u2019m an AH so do some other family members. I obviously can\u2019t take it back from Laura when I already proposed.  AITA? Edit:  The ring was given to me not Jane.  Laura has known my mother her whole life our mothers are best friends and have been hinting we should get married as long as I can remember. Update:  My daughter and brother decided to call my father to come to my house and talk to me. Laura was out to dinner with her friends.  My daughter and brother explained to my father their thoughts on the situation. I stayed quiet while they explained their point so that my father could really hear what my daughter was saying and so I could also hear her out. My father is a marine veteran and very blunt.  My father stopped them and said he\u2019s heard enough. He said my mother would have wanted Laura to have the ring and Jane isn\u2019t showing fhe maturity to receive an heirloom right now. He told her he\u2019s disappointed in her entitlement and that she needed to get her attitude in check by his next visit. He also reminded everyone Laura\u2019s been family for years even before we were together even if it\u2019s not by blood.  My daughter said yes sir and isn\u2019t happy about the outcome but accepts my father saying this is what my mother wanted. Final update:  Since everyone wants to know Laura\u2019s take here we go. I told Laura what was going on and that Jane is upset. I also told her the ring is hers now and she can decide who it is eventually passed down to. I know a lot of people won\u2019t agree with this but it\u2019s what I\u2019m doing.  We have a pre nup in the works for other properties we own. Laura suggested adding the ring just for secure minds and we agreed we would add that it would be given back to the family if we were to divorce.  Laura will not be passing on the ring unless she passes away. That is my fathers request to her and she is honoring that.  We have spoken to Jane and I have explained all of this. I\u2019ve explained she\u2019ll always be my daughter and that won\u2019t change. She understands. She apologized to Laura and me for her behavior and explained she was just upset. Laura had a one on one talk with her as well about how she loves her and isn\u2019t trying to replace anyone or change the family dynamic we have. Jane seems to feel better. Update:  Laura might be pregnant. Jane does know. Update:  The ring has been added to our will. We have decided to continue the tradition I started of the ring going to a son to give to his wife. If we do not have a son then the ring will go to a grandson or to my nephew. Since the ring will not be given to anyone until we pass we are not telling Jane that has been added to the will.",

        "selftext": "Longtime lurker here. Hoping some of you guys can weigh in on what has become a really frustrating situation with a close friend and his partner. So my wife (29F) and I (29M) have been hosting dinner parties a few times a year for as long as we\u2019ve lived in our current city. We like to go all out and cook elaborate multi-course meals, so we limit our invitations to just a few close friends, since cooking such a complex dinner is an all-day affair and the food costs add up quickly. We have about four to six people we invite to these events, depending on their availability, and it\u2019s become a great tradition in our social circle.  Our friend James started dating his girlfriend Sarah about a year and a half ago, and when we first extended her an invitation, we were informed that Sarah was vegan. I thanked James for letting us know and said she was more than welcome to bring her own food so she would have something to eat. He agreed, and the two of them have been attending our parties regularly for the past year. Everything was fine, until now. During our most recent dinner this past week, we noticed that Sarah was very quiet and looked like she was about to cry. My wife asked her what was wrong, but she told us not to worry about it and kept dodging the question, so we didn\u2019t push the issue.  However, after the meal, James took us aside privately and told us that Sarah felt hurt because we never provided any dishes she could eat at our dinners and it seemed like we were deliberately excluding her. He added that he thought we were being rude and inconsiderate by not accommodating her, which really pissed me off, and we got into a huge argument over it.  My wife feels terrible that Sarah was so upset and apologized to her and James profusely, but I don\u2019t agree that we did anything wrong. I like Sarah very much as a person and I don\u2019t have anything against her dietary choices, but I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s fair to expect us to change our entire menu or make an entire separate meal for one person, especially when so much time and effort goes into creating these dinners. For the record, nobody else has any dietary restrictions. AITA?",

        "selftext": " hey guys! So, a bit of context I (M32) have been with my wife (F30) for 3 years. she comes from a country where women get to keep their maiden name after marriage which was fine with me though as someone who comes from the south my family pushed for my wife to take my last name but she ended up keeping hers which made my family somewhat unhappy saying it was disrespectful of her to keep her maiden name but thankfully they got over it and things got better and we reconciled later. now this last name issue has been brought up again when my wife and I found out we were expecting a baby boy.I sat with my wife down and told her that my son is going to get my last name and explained so that there's no confusion but she disagreed and said no and came up with a compromise which was that our son gets both our last names but I declined explaining how awkward and confusing and just complicated that would be. not too mention the middle name so that would be a long name but she said I should consider since my last name will still be there but I said no and told her we'll just have to go with what most families here do and is going by the father's last name. she threw a fit calling me selfish and accused me of treating her as if she as a mother gets less or no say but I reminded her that she got to keep her maiden name and so we're even. she then argued that I was mixing two things that are unrelated and was holding the fact she got to keep her maiden over her head though it was her right to do that same with deciding what surname our son will have. I said I was sorry but I can not accept this compromise especially with how my family will react and told her she should just go with the flow and agree on my son having my last name. she got upset and refused to talk to me after that calling me selfish and a dictator and a minion for my family even though I'm just looking out for our son's best intetest and keeping them in mind. I just think she's being deliberately stubborn here. but I'm not sure. Aita? EDIT Jesus, whoah guys..there is just way too many responses here man and I won't be able to respond to all of them BUT I've got a couple of things to say and I'm adding them here for everyone to see. ONE - Just to be perfectly clear here I did NOT have an issue with my wife keeping her last name. in fact I encouraged her to stick to it after my family started giving us grief about it. And TWO - The main reason I was initially against using both names is the fact that our son might end up having a very long name as a full name.that's it. I have nothing against my wife's last name. I respect it I respect her family (they seem sane and levelheaded) and I appreciate them a lot. but as two blended families with two different backgrounds we kinda...we tend to disagree sometimes.",

        "selftext": "I (32m, white) am potentially in trouble at work, but I don't really think I deserve it. My coworker, Anna (23-ish f, asian), is new at our office and she brings her own lunch on days we don't have a food truck. On Thursday (yesterday), she brought in a homemade stir fry and used our shared microwave in the break room to do it. I was in the room when she took it out of the microwave, and it smelled heavenly. I asked her about the recipe and she told me it was just a bunch of ingredients and spices thrown together as to not waste any veggies that might go bad soon.  When I was telling her how good it smelled, I also mentioned that some other people at the office might think it would be too smelly or ethnic (as in, racist people tend to look down on ethnic things). I have read those kind of stories on here about microagressions when it comes to people of color and the food they bring in, and I wanted to warn her that she might not want to bring it in anymore so it doesn't happen to her. I emphasized that it smelled good to me personally, though. I guess a couple of the other co-workers in the room overheard our conversation, because after Anna left the room, some of them sort of quietly told me how it was inappropriate for me to have said that. I told them that it's true, that ethnic food gets ridiculed for smelling too strong and that I disagreed with that senitment, but I also think she would face less harassment if she didn't bring in that food anymore. One of my other coworkers then said that I was the only one harassing her and making insinuations that her food is problematic, plus the fact that she hasn't even been bringing in her own food that often since she just started last week, so there couldn't have been an opportunity to have had this hypothetical harassment happen to her. I just wanted people, yes, even the assholes, at the office to make her feel welcomed. I left work that day not thinking anything of it, until the following morning where I hear from a different coworker that Anna talked to our HR department about the conversation and how she was hurt. I'm a bit frustrated as to why she didn't talk to me about it first since it was just a misunderstanding and that I'm looking out for her. I did notice that today she was trying to dodge me, which is unusual and a bit heartbreaking. I just want to work things out. I wanted to be a friend to her and help her out since this is one of her first jobs out of undergrad, but this has been blown of out proportion. Now my coworkers think I'm racist, but I really try my best to be an ally, but then again what do I know? So, am I the asshole for telling her that her food might be a bit too much for other potentitally racist people in the office to handle? EDIT: Some people have said to edit this post to add this: yes, I get it, I'm the asshole. What I said was really stupid. If it means anything to you guys, I remember entering the workforce as a young man shadowing assholes and I didn't know how to express how shitty I was treated since I thought it was normal to be treated a certain way or overhear certain things. I just thought she was a sweet girl who didn't deserve to see the nasty side of corporate life so quick, but I guess I ended up being like the guys that made my earlier career so god awful.  Anyway I want to apologize to her in the most HR-friendly way this Tuesday. Hopefully she doesn't quit, but I also don't want to be the one that gets fired. Fingers crossed. Thank you for opening my eyes and I hope to do my due diligence to be a real ally.",

        "selftext": "Me (26m) and my wife (24f) have been married for 4 years. During those 4 years she had the same job which requires her to be away Friday to Sunday, so she leaves early on Friday and returns about 4-5pm on Sunday. Occasionally it would be leaving on Saturday and returning Sunday. She also has to work some of the school/public holidays. I work full time and get just a bit above minimum wage and tips, so our bills are split 60 (her) to 40(me). While I find myself struggling with money and having to have to borrow from the joint bank account, my wife never have this problem. I know she is getting paid more then I do as she works for a high profile client, but I'm not sure by how much more. She also wouldn't tell me what exactly she is doing, all I know is that it is connected to her degree and it is 100% not a sex work or nothing in that industry. The reason why she won't tell me is because she signed the contract and it is highly confidential so she is not allowed to go into details. She does chores around the house but doesn't cook (she admits herself she is a bad cook and hates it), instead she would order either those premade healthy meals you then heat up for herself or takeaway. When I'm home and she hasn't ordered she will order for me too. So most of the day while I'm working she is either in our house chilling (watching TV, playing video games, reading or exercising) or shopping or in the gym. Over the years I got annoyed with this and have asked her to find another job so she has something to do while I'm working instead of wasting her day. She told me she is not wasting her day but relaxing and her job pays her enough so she can afford the lifestyle she wants. I said it is not fair on me, as I come home tired while she has done nothing all day, to which she said I can find another job or a different job but I am an asshole for wanting her to find another job because I feel tired when coming back from my work, when she has already got a job she loves. After she won't talk to me. I have spoken to my family and while my parents agree with me that she needs to work, my sisters took my wife's side and called me a massive asshole. Edit: I'm not saying she needs to quit the job she has. I'm saying she needs to find another job to do during her freetime, could be a part time one, since she doesn't really do much during the day.",

Couple days ago me and my brother we\u2019re hanging out late night doing regular guy things drinking, watching sports, etc. We haven\u2019t seen each other in maybe 5-6 years so naturally we started talking about life and what\u2019s been going on the past few years. Towards the end of our conversation we started to get to the \u201csecrets\u201d I mentioned something along the lines that I smoked weed for the first time and did various other substances (This was hard for me to tell because my whole life I was pretty much anti-drugs and such.) We both laughed about it saying \u201cJust don\u2019t let mom find out\u201d The joke died out after a little bit and then he just blurted out \u201cI cheated on my wife...\u201d At first it didn\u2019t register until I saw his face and he was dead serious. I for one hate cheaters, but I try to do my best not to judge anyone for their actions. He begins explaining this was something that happened about 4 years ago when his wife was always busy with work. She would travel a lot and be away for weeks at a time. He told me they were going through a tough time back then lots of arguing, not communicating, and that he felt really lonely. During this same time my brother met a girl at his local gym, started off as friends, slowly kept bonding and you guessed they did the sex. He told me this occasion only happened once and pretty much cut her off after that night because he started to feel guilty for a short while. Few months later his relationship turned for the better for him and his wife. Pretty much after his wife\u2019s travels slowed down his whole relationship has been great. They\u2019ve both gotten promotions, bought a house, more family vacations. (They have a kid) He told me life has been good to him now and he\u2019s just thankful things have finally worked out.  As stated before I hate cheaters and I\u2019ve always felt that the person being cheated on always has the right know. I know for sure this would probably destroy their marriage and there would be a fight for the kid. My heart tells me I have to tell her because it\u2019s the right thing to do, especially because I\u2019ve known my brother to cheat one other time on an ex-girlfriend couple years before his current wife. My brain tells me it\u2019s none of my business and I should keep my mouth shut. I don\u2019t want to see their kid go throughout that kind pain either. On one hand I betray my brother if I say something on the other hand I betray our close family friend because I know this secret and I don\u2019t say anything. I wish he never told me, ignorance is truly bliss. So there it is, WIBTA if I said something? TLDR: Brother Cheated on his wife years ago because he was depressed, now everything is better and he told me about it, but now I feel obligated to tell his wife because she\u2019s a close friend. WIBTA? Edit: I\u2019m referring SIL as close family friend because my family and her family have known each since elementary school days and thus are Very close lol. I thought this iteration would make the relationship sound stronger than just SIL, but it looks like I was wrong. Second Edit: Wow this is on the front page, I never intended nor expected this blow up as it did! I\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t reply to everyone, but there will be some kind of update.",

But can be civil enough to sit at the same table. So, we went and had dinner and talked and everything was going well, no argument nothing til after my wife went to use the bathroom. Later my brother went to use the bathroom then came back looking pissed. He kept giving me and my wife looks but I didn't know what was going on til he pulled me aside before we left and told me that my wife had left her used pad in his bathroom. I was shocked and didn't know what to say because this felt highly inappropriate. He said he didn't appreciate what my wife did and that it was a sign of disrespect towards him. I apologized profoundly and said I didn't know about it. He asked me to speak to her or she wouldn't be welcome in his place anymore. We got in the car and I asked my wife about it, she nonchantly said there was nothing wrong with what she did and that my brother was being ridiculous. I kind of flipped and told her it was very inappropriate for her to leave her used pad in his place even if it was in the bathroom and in the trashcan because it made him uncomfortable. She yelled asking what she was supoosed to do and I told her she could've took it with her and threw it outside not in his bathroom -- that's my brother's place and he told me how he felt about it. She yelled at me calling my brother an incel and me an asshole for getting in her face about it. She said she needed to use the bathroom and it's not like the pad was vidible since she dumped it in the trashcan. At home we still argued about it and she kept on calling me and my brother names. She's currently not speaking to me and is avoiding me entirely. Regardless, I feel like it's his place and he gets to express what makes him uncomfortable in it. EDIT. I can't give info or expand on what was seen but I can tell you that the trash can does not have a lid. It's not like one of those trashcans that have a lid on top and you can push it. What I want to emphasize on is the fact that as guests we should respect people's homes and not argue about what makes them uncomfortable. He said it made him uncomfortable and that should, in my opinion, be acknowledged.",

Sophies mom called me yesterday, said that they were at an indoor playground, and Sophie wanted to know if Ellie could come and play. Sophies mom offered to put me on her punch card (she prepays for 10-20 visits at a time because it\u2019s cheaper) so it would be free for me so I got Ellie in the car and we met them at the playground.  After about an hour of playing, the girls started to get hungry. I packed a snack for Ellie but Sophie\u2019s mom didn\u2019t have any snacks on her. I told her they sell snacks in the front but she claimed that she didn\u2019t have any money on her and asked me to buy Sophie some goldfish. I said sure, Venmo me and I\u2019ll grab some.  I said no, I took care of my kid and it\u2019s not my job to take care of hers too. She says she paid for my kid to get in so I could cover the $2 for the goldfish. I told her if she wanted me to bring snacks she should\u2019ve told me when she invited me but I won\u2019t be wasting $2 for a $.50 bag of goldfish because she was unprepared. She went up to the front and I don\u2019t know if she lied about not having money but she came back with goldfish and fruit snacks. Now she\u2019s being petty by asking me to pay her back for all of the times we\u2019ve used their memberships and guest passes so we\u2019re not getting along.

For a multitude of reasons we haven't done a trip since 2018.  I am married and we have an 18 month old.  My sister has a boyfriend, and my brother has some sort of terrier and no GF I know of. My brother has morphed into a self described dog dad and based off social media seems to rarely do things without the dog.  We live in the same city, but different areas and we don't see him all that much.  The few times i've been around his dog it behaves fine.  Its too friendly for me and I can't speak to how it behaves over multiple days or around babies. My parents have a Vrbo beach house in Florida booked.  In a few week the deadline for a full refund for canceling is coming up and my parents need to know if we are in.  We live in the west side of the USA so we'd be flying.  I found out my brother plans to bring his dog.  My parents aren't thrilled about it but it is what it is, those are my parents words. I'm not a dog person, I despise them on airplanes.  I do not want to travel with the dog (tentatively we are on the same flight), I do not want to stay the week in the same house as the dog, I do not want activities based on being dog friendly, and I do not want the dog around my son. Our parents want to stay out of it and have us hash it out.  I broached the topic with my brother.  Essentially he isn't flexible on the dog, it is his family and it is a family vacation.  He says my 18 month old will be far more annoying and loud than his dog.  He seems firm on this and i'm ready to pull out of the trip.  If I don't go, the trip may fall apart.  WIBTA?",

        "selftext": "I have a big family that\u2019s incredibly close. We have big family dinners every few months where we all meet at my great grand fathers estate and eat together. Typically how this works is that the women go cook for the time they\u2019re there and the men don\u2019t. Which I am fully aware it\u2019s sexist as hell. That being said I am one of the youngest people in family and my protests mean literally nothing.  Some of those women choose not to cook, however this is usually met with a level of ostracizing. The women who don\u2019t cook are lives and long term girlfriends. So they kinda already have a good family relationship doctored in. When I have seen new partners not cook, it\u2019s gone bad. Like completely ostracized, not speaking, cattiness, rudeness etc. This dinner will be in two weeks and my girlfriend was asked if she would attend. Initially she said yes, which is great. I want for her to meet everyone and for everyone to get used to her being around, but when I explained to her the tradition she was understandably bothered.  I told her that I understood where she was coming from, however it was best for everyone if she just played along. I told her this isn\u2019t a permanent thing and that I am only asking her to do this so that she can avoid bad treatment from the rest of the family. This is her first impression and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s best if we cause waves. She told me that it\u2019s unacceptable and that if she has to do that she will not be going. I\u2019ve tried to find a compromise with her on this but she won\u2019t budge and she\u2019s pissed at me. She told me that if I think it\u2019s acceptable to make her do this I\u2019m just as bad as everyone else, while my point is that she needs to make a good first impression. AITA?",

The only downside is that he\u2019s almost addicted to buying things that are on sale or have coupons despite being a VP at his company. I\u2019m not talking about sometimes or even most of the time, I would be alright with that. He never buys anything at full price. NEVER! He plans his cooking around what\u2019s on sale that week at the grocery stores. All of his clothes were bought on sale or clearance, even his socks and boxers. Last week we were at my friend\u2019s house for dinner and she commented on his shirt. He proudly said he got it on clearance last year for $20. I was mortified. Lastly, we don\u2019t go to any restaurant unless he finds a coupon or they\u2019re running some kind of special. Things came to ahead last night when we went out to dinner. He had a digital coupon for buy one get one free. For some reason, the restaurant\u2019s computer didn\u2019t recognize the deal and the poor cashier couldn\u2019t make it work. We were holding up the crowded line because he refused to pay for both dinners. Finally the cashier called the manager but he was busy somewhere else in the restaurant. While we waited, the people behind us were getting annoyed. I was so embarrassed I left him standing in line by himself and went to the car. We argued the entire drive home. We were supposed to go to the movies, because he got free tickets, but I wasn\u2019t in the mood so he dropped me off. We haven\u2019t texted today at all.

I don't know how he ended up with my sister, she's the total opposite, loud, funny, outgoing. She's beautiful tho, really beautiful, and when they got together everyone said how good they looked. Anna seemed to be really in love with him ALL THE TIME, she used to say how dreamy he was, how good he treated her and how spoiled she felt, but Lance was always so stern and quiet, she would revolve around him at family gatherings but he wouldn't engage that much with everyone but me and her. I was surprised when he asked her to marry him.My sister never took the wifey role too serious, she had a non-traditional wedding and Lance when along with it, she made a bunch of rules that he agreed to and then they moved to his house. Anna banned house utensils from the wedding gift list, she doesn't work, didn't finish her studies and they don't plan on having kids. My sister is pretty much only into her looks (And I didn't think Lance cared for that before), she's always on Snapchat or Instagram, I thought that after getting married she would dress more appropriate since she used to use crop tops, blouses, dresses and shirts that showed her cleavage, short skirts or tight jean, but she says that Lance likes her just fine. Last week was my dad's birthday and we had a party, my sister and Lance came and she was wearing a pretty short floral dress, nonetheless most of the men were looking at her including my dad's friends, Lance was as stoic as always and my sister came to my mom and I and saying that she didn't know why he was so quiet since he's not like that (HE is like that wtf) so I told her that if she didn't dressed like that he might take her more seriously. She got sad and sat quietly the rest of the night and I didn't think much of that, but a few days ago Lance texted me and said that he would appreciate if I didn't comment on her wife's way of dressing again. ???

I like to keep notes on women I talk to about their favorite things, activities they enjoy, gifts/candy they like, sappy shit like that. I suck at remembering things like that so I decided to keep a spreadsheet. Eventually after getting a handful of entries. I offhandedly mentioned it to my friend group. One had the idea that I share it with them so we could all keep new entries as they \u201ccaught\u201d different entries.  So this expanded further. Right now about 40 guys have access to it and it\u2019s mainly the guys in my frat, and the women featured are girls from different sororities. We also added more information such as like where you should take them if you really wanna impress them. We don\u2019t keep this information for any nefarious or scumbaggy reasons.  Just to help us know what to do if we want to impress certain girls. Like the original idea of this was just to keep information like favorite color so I didn\u2019t every forget their favorite colors. Now it\u2019s helping a lot of guys. Somehow, a girl who was on the list found out and she was pissed tf off. She was eventually able to trace it back to me so I assume someone who was simping for her snitched when the Pok\u00e9dex wasn\u2019t making the girl like him. So she\u2019s pissed off and she made it out to be a guide to hooking up with women, when it\u2019s most definitely not that. It\u2019s just to make impressing them on dates easier. That\u2019s it. She\u2019s made a big deal of this telling so many girls around campus and now they\u2019re all saying that by the start of the fall semester, none of them will be visiting our fraternity or going to our parties. Now all the guys are mad at me, when I\u2019m not even the one who told girls about the list and they were all also using the list. I also think it\u2019s unfair to say the list was all about sex when it wasn\u2019t at all. AITA? Edit- I\u2019m not a stalker. There was no information in it that could\u2019ve been used to hurt someone. Only to have a better date. And it isn\u2019t about sex. I never used it for just sex.",

My neighbor across the hall, a woman around my age or a little younger (I actually don't know her first name but I'll call her Katie) lives across the hall from me diagonally and has for about 2 years. We exchange hellos but aren't friendly, which is how it is with most of my neighbors. So I don't know how to cook, and due to losing one of my part time gigs, I don't have as much money for takeout anymore. I'm getting really sick of eating cheap fast food or box mac and cheese. I'm gaining weight and I never feel great. This is where Katie comes in. I can always smell her cooking in the hall and it always smells amazing (I know it isn't the other person at our end of our hall cause it's a single old man). I've even complimented it a few times. So I got the idea that I'd offer to give her some money each week to cook a little extra and bring it over to me (or I can pick it up from her!) at night. She's cooking anyway and then I'd have varied presumably delicious food. I asked her the next time I saw her and she looked surprised and said she couldn't because she was too busy (which didn't make sense cause she cooks almost every day but okay). The next time I saw her a few days later, I asked her if she was sure and upped the amount I was offering, and she said she was sure and that it was rude to ask me, and that she isn't a housekeeper for hire and I should get a housekeeper if that's what I want. She also called me 'a stranger' even though we have talked in the halls before. Overall she made me feel like a big jerk and really embarrassed for even asking her, and a little mad because she was acting like I was being creepy (I wasn't, trust me, she isn't my type). I think asking her to split cooking wasn't completely outlandish, since she cooks every day anyway and it wouldn't be hard to make a little more. So, AITA? EDIT: People keep assuming I'm sexist because I didn't think it was the old man who lives on our hall cooking. It's not an assumption for me. He and I have lived across from each other for 6 years. The cooking smells didn't start til she moved in, and I've talked to her about how good her cooking smells before. EDIT: Okay. It is abundantly clear that I was the asshole and asking her was inappropriate and, as much as I hate to admit it, creepy. My instinct is to apologize to her but since my instinct was to ask her in the first place, I'll do the opposite and stay out of her hair. Thanks.",

We were all sitting at dinner table and I remembered when my brother's girlfriend, who's a widow, saying that she keeps an urn of her late husband's ashes in the house. Conversation let from one thing to another then, I looked at my brother and asked him quietly if he was comfortable with having his girlfriend's late husband's urn in the house. he gave me a long stare so I figured the answer was yes but maybe, he couldn't tell his girlfriend about it fearing she'd misunderstand maybe?. So I brought it up with her and told her it was quite weird to have her late husband's urn in the house. She looked at me and was apparently caught off guard by what I said. she said that she didn't think so and that it wasn't like the urn was on display, also said this is her late husband's house and where the urn should be. I told her it felt weird especially, since she just had my brother move in with her and he must be feeling uncomfortable with the idea, his girlfriend looked upset and got quiet. my brother shouted none of your goddamned business, shut your mouth Elijah, jeezus! I responded with I mean..personally I wouldn't be cool with my girl keeping an urn of her ex within close approximate, at best best it'd make me feel uncomfortable, at worst it'd make me feel creeped out. his girlfriend then replyed by saying that I have no business dating a widow then and I shrugged. She excused herself to the kitchen and stayed there, my brother went off on me calling me an obnoxios asshole for making dinner awkward and upsetting his girlfriend. I told him I was just giving my opinion but he lashed out more. my parents and I left and they told me my brother's girlfriend was being hypersensitive, but I too went too far and upset my brother and probably sparked an argument between them and I should reach to apologize but I'm not sure. [edit] Guys! please, One thing you should know is that I had no intentions of being hurtful. I do not hate my brother's girlfriend, infact, we get along pretty well but I just wanted to add that I had no malicious intent here. I'm not the the type of guys who go out of their way to act maliciously but I feel kind of guilty for how the situation played out. [edit2] my parents are the ones who said she was being hypersensitive, not me. [edit3] Yes, I overheard my brother venting about the urn when he first moved in just so you know.",

        "selftext": "Our son is 22 and our daughter is 26. She bought a house in July. We know that moving into a new home always comes with unexpected costs, right after you've probably depleted most of your funds. So, for Christmas we gave her $4000. Our son we gave a few different gifts totaling somewhere around $800. Our daughter had to work Christmas, but we did Christmas on the 26th and she stayed with us for the holidays from then until yesterday. Our son still lives with us, and today he told us both that he didn't want to say anything while his sister was here, but his feelings were hurt by the disparity in the value of the gifts. We explained that the gifts we got him were tailored to his interests, but his sister has just passed a big life milestone where money is more important to her right now than sentiment. He said it's still hurtful because it feels like we are more proud of her than him. My wife got really frustrated when he said that and asked why he would choose the least charitable interpretation of our actions. He said that's just how he felt and he couldn't control it. I said that we didn't give her money because we were more proud, but because we had experience being new homeowners and knowing that something always breaks in that first six months and it's always expensive. He said that was all fine and good, but it still hurt to get a worse present and feel like an afterthought. My wife asked if he expected us to get him four thousand dollars worth of gifts. He said no, but he expected the gifts between him and his sister to be equal. My wife said that's the same thing, and my son said it isn't. He said we could have given her the monetary equivalent of what we gave him. I told him that it isn't really fair for him to decide how much we spend on someone else's gift. Furthermore, cash is less personal than gifts, so giving her a cash equivalent to what he got would be her getting the worse gift. He said we weren't listening to him, just justifying. My wife said we didn't need to justify anything, and he was being entitled. At that point he said he didn't want to talk unless everyone was civil and he went to his room. He skipped lunch (breakfast for him) today, and when he left for work he didn't say goodbye even though I was right by the door. My wife is irritated, and my son is clearly resenting us. I can't really decide if we're in the wrong here. On the one hand, we should be able to give our money to whoever we want. On the other, I never want to hurt my son's feelings. Were we wrong?",

        "selftext": "I got a dog 2 years ago (Corgi) and she is very much so my side kick. I've been with my fiance for 5 years. My fiance does like the dog but she is currently pregnant and experiencing massive migraines and has been snapping at everything.  So every morning when I get up I find my fiance already awake and at the table relaxing. As soon as I get out of the bed, my dog goes nuts. It's like super energy where she is running sideways, barking up a storm, jumping from the bed to the floor a million times (causing the apartment to shake because it's old asf), etc and I will sit there and sing made up songs to her and just fuck around with her. It is pretty noisy and I can be loud. It's just my way of interacting with my pet. I also have ADHD, so I'm fully aware that I can be ridiculously loud and sometimes I simply forget to tone it down. My fiance has complained about it a few times and I will absolutely try to tone it down for awhile but as fucked up as it sounds, the second she stops complaining and it's out of sight, out of mind, I start doing it again. If I catch myself I apologize immediately but sometimes I don't even catch myself doing it.  So she has been getting up earlier than normal because she says she needs peace and quiet away from you and the dog because she can't hear herself think when we get up and then she starts getting migraines and being overall pissed off. But now she is complaining because I can sense her not in the bed anymore probably after twenty minutes of her being gone and her warmth no longer there and then I'm wide awake and the dog senses it and ya know. So she's now getting pissed because she thinks I'm purposely not letting her have space and purposely annoying her with my behaviors. I'm not, truly but it seems like it I guess. I've tried just laying in bed for awhile so she can relax but I get stir crazy and I also don't feel like I should have to stay in bed so she can be alone when I live here too.  But she flipped this morning. I felt her sneaking out of bed this morning at 5am and tiptoe out of the room. I watched her sit at the table with her book. Well, the dog saw me awake and immediately goes ballistic. Jumping on the bed, whining, barking, etc. She comes in and says will you guys calm down so I can have time to myself for once? I just side eyed her because I'm getting pissed at this point with her demands. She says well? I tell her to get over herself. Just because she's pregnant doesn't mean I have to change who I am or change how the household works or change my dynamic with my dog. She immediately left after telling me to go fuck myself and won't answer my calls. She's been gone for 6 hours.",

        "selftext": "A friend at work pointed me to this to get some more advice/points of view on my situation. I (46F) am the mother to two wonderful children, Andrew (16M) and Nicole (21F). Nicole was very bright as a child and excelled in her classes, and she headed into college with a plan to get a Master\u2019s at least. I never had to worry about her doing well or hitting milestones, but the last few years have been very surprising. She became a bit withdrawn in her teen years, more so than I realized until now, and after her first year of college she suddenly moved out from a relative\u2019s home and got her own apartment. Then, after her second year of college (last May) she told me and her father (58M) that she was dropping out and might return in a year, but wasn\u2019t sure, and that she was incredibly stressed and depressed and had been for years. It felt like it was coming out of nowhere.  Last fall she got a full time job and started talking about how she was happy and finally in a good routine and that she loved working. I was glad things were at least going well for her now, but still hoping she\u2019d return to college soon. One of the biggest recent bombshells she dropped on me though was a month ago when I drove to visit her. We went out for lunch, and we started talking about this friend (25F) of hers. Eventually, my daughter admitted to me that she was a lesbian, and that she and this girl had been dating since January and that she FLEW TO MEET HER WITHOUT TELLING ME OR HER FATHER! Mind you, she flew over 1,000 miles to see this girl that she had NEVER MET and had only called and video chatted with for a few months. I was shocked and angry, but all I did was gently scold her for not telling me, but that I\u2019m glad she\u2019s okay and that she had a good time with her girlfriend. I\u2019m very new to this whole thing with my daughter, as I thought she was interested in men, but I\u2019m willing to support her because I love her.  The problem now is that she told me earlier this week that she intends to move within the next year and a half. She says it may be sooner rather than later because things are changing with her girlfriend\u2019s living situation and she wanted to give me a heads up. I told her absolutely not, that she can\u2019t move in with someone she\u2019s only been dating for a couple of months, especially not when she\u2019s moving several states away. All of her family is HERE, including me and her father and her brother, and her three living grandparents. I told her she\u2019s too young and she can\u2019t move that far away from us just for a girl. She told me that regardless of her girlfriend, she\u2019s been wanting to move far away for years and that her girlfriend\u2019s state was on a list of potential places. She said she loved being there when she visited and can\u2019t wait to go back. She says I\u2019m being unreasonable by asking her to stay and that she hates it here and feels like she \u201ccan\u2019t be herself\u201d. Am I being the a-hole here? I don\u2019t think she\u2019s old enough or mature enough to leave. Edit because someone asked- my daughter didn\u2019t ask for money. She almost never asks for money, she\u2019s like her father in that way. She\u2019s almost completely financially independent. I have her on my health/dental insurance to help her out, my mother pays her monthly phone plan because she insisted on doing something for my daughter, and my daughters grandfather on her father\u2019s side pays her car insurance, and my daughter goes to her father when she has car troubles because he has a lot of experience with cars. My daughter takes care of all her other needs on her own. Edit- my child\u2019s father is NOT my husband. We never married. We have not been together since she was born. I would have left him earlier had I not become pregnant. I regret being involved with him because he is why I was introduced and became addicted to drugs. I do not regret my daughter. Please stop calling me a homophobe. I support my daughter. I am just apparently ignorant to some things about being gay. Edit- I am no longer talking about or answering questions about my addiction. Most of you are making baseless assumptions and disgusting accusations and I won\u2019t entertain them. I tried my best to be a good mother and get clean. That\u2019s that. I may not have been the best person to have custody of her as a child, but neither was her actively abusive father who stalked, abused, manipulated, and intimidated me the entire time I\u2019ve known him. Edit 3/24- I can\u2019t keep up with the comments. I\u2019ve also been banned from commenting because I apparently broke a rule. I\u2019m going to try to talk to my daughter about all of this when I see her this weekend. I want to be a part of her life even if I think she\u2019s moving in the wrong direction.",

        "selftext": "Wife and I own a home in an HOA. We split the mortgage and HOA fee 50/50. Recently a vacancy opened up on the Board of Directors and I applied for it and was chosen to serve. As compensation, the HOA fee ($400) is waived for our unit. My wife wants to split this windfall 50/50. I feel since I\u2019m on the Board and do all the work, the $400 should be all mine. She thinks if I keep the $400 it\u2019s tantamount to her *paying me* $200 since our overall housing costs have dropped $400 but she doesn\u2019t benefit financially. This has caused some of our worst fighting and I am leaning towards just giving in and splitting the money even thoughI do all the work. Am I the asshole? UPDATE: I\u2019ve seen the err of my ways and will split the rebate with my wife. Before I get into it, I just want to say there are some very sick people on this subreddit who think they know things about me and my wife with absolutely no basis in fact. But hey, it\u2019s the Internet. Expect trash. As for the many people who commented like a normal person and especially the Redditors who DM\u2019ed me and agreed with or validated my position, thank you. Ultimately, u/flyryan convinced me with saying \u201c[t]he perk you are getting is no longer having to pay the HOA fees. Not a salary of $400/mo. They are saying your household no longer has to pay THEM for their service and you are turning around and collecting $200 from your wife. You\u2019re essentially getting a free service (HOA membership) as a perk for your volunteer work and then reselling half of that service to your wife for $200. She is no longer paying HOA fees, but rather YOU to be HOA president.\u201d  Anyway\u2014while I still believe my position has some logic behind it, I now see my wife\u2019s perspective which helps soften my stance considerably.

Anyway she recently invited me to come over and have dinner with her parents at their home.  She still lives with them for now. We are getting more serious and they wanted to meet me. If it's relevant her parents are Indian immigrants to the US and I am white. So, I thought it was a completely casual meeting and I wore an Iron Maiden T-shirt.

I went and met her parents and thought we'd had a good meeting. However my girlfriend is NOT happy with me. She feels as if me dressing in a T-Shirt rather than a nicer button-up shirt was bad enough, but that wearing a shirt with skulls on it was--in her words--just obnoxious. I honestly just dressed for the meeting the way I usually do and didn't even think about it. I think that if she had certain standards that she should have communicated them to me beforehand. But she thinks that what I did was obviously stupid and inappropriate and that I should have known better. Is she right or is she being too critical?",

        "selftext": "I ride the bus because I can't afford a car, insurance, gas, etc. I'm 19F and live in the US. For context.  A couple days ago I was on a bus that wasn't that busy. Not empty, but there were multiple unused seats and no one had to stand. I had just gone shopping and had heavy bags that were hard to carry and hardly fit in front of my legs.  So I sat in one seat and placed my bags on the seat next to me, essentially taking up 2 seats on my own. Since it wasn't crowded when I got on I didn't see an issue and like I said the bags were super heavy and hurt to carry so I wanted to set them down.  The bus ride was kind of long and as it went on more and more people got on the bus. It eventually got pretty crowded to the point where some people had to stand up.  I didn't ever move my bag or offer the seat to someone. In my experience most people don't want to sit next to strangers anyway and a lot of the time people will end up standing instead of sitting in an empty seat next to someone they don't know. Also no one said anything to me.  At the last stop (ended at the bus station where pretty much everyone was getting off) someone passive aggressively told me you could have moved your bag and not been inconsiderate and rude. Everyone wants to sit not just you. Or something along those lines. I didn't really respond because I didn't know what to say.  The person who said that never asked me to move my stuff, and if they did I probably would have. So I don't understand how I was being rude? They could have asked during the ride instead of insulting me after it was already done. Busses are also generally first come first serve so I think my behavior was normal.  AITA?",

When I married my husband I kept my maiden name which he was perfectly okay with. We already discussed this and agreed that any future kids we have will automatically take his last name. His family considers this huge deal and I decided to keep to just go with it. But recently I started thinking about it a lot more and figured that it would be unfair for my unborn son to take my husband's family name and not mine. I talked to my family and they said my husband and inlaws are ridiculous to push this on me without a compromise expecting I go with it. So I went home and told my husband that I've changed my mind about the last name thing and want to either have both our last names combined or my last name to be given to our son. He was confused saying we had an agreement and then asked what was the cause of this sudden change of mind. I told him and he said I can't just do that and called me selfish when I pointed out that I'm the mother I get a say too. We went back n forth on this and he said no way he and his family will let me do this to his son, as if my last name is a disgrace. We had a fight and we stopped talking after this. He said that I broke and violated my part of the deal and I should just 'deal' with it now but I won't accept it. AITA?",

        "selftext": "My wife (35F) and I (35M) have been together for 10 years, married 5. We grew up completely different. She's the only child of a surgeon father. Her mother died when she was 2 and it was her and her father for most of her life. He remarried when she was 17. He's wealthy, sent her to private school, paid for her college, and when we met a decade ago he was still paying her rent, even though she had a solid job. I come from a poor family. But we both have pretty good jobs and make around the same amount of money now. She is such a daddy's girl and it's been affecting our relationship. Anytime she wants or needs something, she goes to her dad first. And sometimes it's about things I could help with. I work in tech and back when we started dating she was starting grad school and she asked her dad what laptop should I get  I told her I actually work in the field (which she already knew) and could easily answer that and get her what she needs and she just kind of shrugged. Okay fine. These little things have happened throughout the last decade. But, there have been bigger issues recently.Last year, she decided she needs a new car. I disagreed. Her car is fine and she works from home and barely drives. She was adamant, though. About a month later, she tells me she's getting a new car. I told her we need to make these decisions together and we share finances and this is a major purchase. She says, oh, my dad is buying it. He said we can just sell mine and get some extra money. I told her it's kind of ridiculous to ask her dad to buy her a brand new car when she has a perfectly good one and we don't need it anyways. She got upset and said it's not that big of a deal and her dad doesn't mind and that the car wasn't that expensive anyways. She said I'm overreacting and that it's okay for her dad to do nice things for her. She got a brand new 2022 car completely paid for by her dad. And we sold her old one. Now, we are buying a new house. We've finally narrowed it down to two options. We were discussing it last week and my wife says oh I don't think house A is good my dad said he think we could do a lot better in our budget. Before she talked to her dad, she LOVED House A. So, I got a bit frustrated and said it didn't matter what her dad thought because this is our family's home and he won't be living there. She got angry. We started arguing. We both said mean things. I called her a spoiled brat and said she needed to grow up and she got upset and slept in the guest room and has it's been a few days and we have barely spoken. She said I was so mean to her.  UPDATE: wow did not expect this to get so much traction. This was mostly a late night stream of consciousness and I realize I left a lot out, of course. I DID apologize to my wife for the name calling and we both agreed we have some issues to work through. Here's some more info for context and to answer some questions I've seen asked:  1. We could have afforded the car on our own. We do well for ourselves. I was not worried about not being able to afford it. I just did not understand the rationale of buying a brand new car when you have a perfectly good one. Her old car wasn't even that old. It was a 2019 and had pretty much all of the same features her new one has. It didn't make sense to me. Also, we have a toddler and it's actually harder for her to get him in the new car than the old one. She also barely drives. I mean, seriously, the car sits in the garage 90% of the time. She has even said before that she hates driving. Sure it was free but I guess it's more about the principle than the car itself. But, she got what she wanted so whatever.  2. We've been together 10 years - has it always been this  way? Why did I stay? --- valid points. And something I could dig deeper on. No answer right now other than I just fell in love and didn't want to leave.  3. Do I have my own daddy issues? No, not really. My dad and I are fine. My parents are still married. We were very poor growing up and my parents were undocumented, and that was a very stressful way to live but my family made it work. I live on the other side of the country now so I don't see them as much but we talk and visit regularly.  4. My father in law is a nice enough guy and for what it's worth, he also says his daughter is spoiled and has made comments throughout the years about it. Obviously I didn't need to call her a spoiled brat and I recognize the difference in her dad saying it and me but I am not the first person to say it to her. I KNOW THAT DOESN'T MAKE IT RIGHT.  5. I recognize I have my own issues due to poverty, trauma and all of that. I have been to individual therapy. That is a forever ongoing process.  6. The house: All of the reasons my wife gave me are just matters of personal preference, like my dad says we need a bigger kitchen, my dad says we need a bigger backyard. He is also convinced we will have more children even though we said we so not want anymore so he also said we need more rooms for more kids. Nothing about safety of the house, the price, etc..just things he personally doesn't like or would have different in his home. Also we've been looking for over a year and he has given his thoughts many many times throughout the year. So, I'm not saying she shouldn't ask him for advice. Also, no, he would not be paying for any of the house.  7. My wife has never been to any type of counseling in her life. When I suggested grief counseling for her after I started my own she looked at me like I said something ridiculous. Her family is very skeptical about therapy. So, I'm not sure if I will get her to do marriage counseling but we will talk about this further.  8. Finally, my wife is a funny, creative, and beautiful woman. She's a great mom. She makes everyone laugh. I do love her despite what the post may make some of you believe. Thanks to those who sent me thoughtful messages. They provided interesting perspectives. ALSO THIS NOT A FULL PICTURE OF EVERYTHING. I'M JUST NOT WILLING TO SPEND ANYMORE TIME WRITING IT. IT'S A LOT.",

        "selftext": "Throwaway because people who know me are on here.  Before the birth of our daughter, my wife and I both worked full time in low-middle earning jobs with my wife earning a bit more than I but not by much.  My wife returned to work out of necessity when our daughter was 3 months old. Her mental health became pretty bad and she has a minor disability that makes work life a little hard and she found it a bit worse after having our daughter but we had to do what we had to do.  My wife's nan who sort of raised her and was her only family passed away sadly when our daughter was 6 months old. My wife inherited everything she owned. It was a big inheritance. Not enough for us both to immediately retire but a lot. Enough for us to buy a decent house outright, a new car each and to put some away for a comfortable retirement.\u00a0  Shortly after her nan died, my wife stopped working and became a stay at home mom. Partially due to grief and struggles at her job, and a bit because she always would have preferred to stay home with our daughter.\u00a0 Thing is though, I'd rather not work and be a stay at home dad too but I've been sucking it up because we still need an income to get by.  My wife spoke with me recently about how to budget so we can live off just my income (she'd been dipping into savings to pull her weight but that's all tied up in investments now). I said if I'm the one who has to work (and I'd rather not) I don't think I should have to spend my money funding her hobbies and spending money. If she chooses not to work then she can buy clothes at the charity shop instead of new and get a friend to cut her hair for free etc. Or she can get a job working a night shift or start an online business or something to fund her spending money. I don't see why I should have to pay for stuff like her sewing materials and gym membership since I don't benefit from them and they're not my responsibility. I'm happy to pay for stuff for our daughter seeing as she's my responsibility so I don't think I'm being unreasonable here. I work 36 hours a week and I already pay for the bills and food. She said that's not fair if I get to enjoy my gym membership and hobbies like video games but the difference is I'm paying for them with my money. My wife said her inheritance was worth more than if she spent her whole life working and without that, both of us would be working anyway and having higher expenses from paying a mortgage and car loans so I should count that as her contribution and share my money with her.

They are both great kids that are successful, accomplished and I couldn't be more proud, but lead very different lives.  We all still live in the same area, the area I raised them at.  One (F25) travels extensively for work and has an on again off again boyfriend and the other (F28) is married and has a 3 month old son.   My daughter with the 3 month old works full time and is going back to work as her maternity leave is ending.  I work part time but offered to watch my grandson at my house while they are at work.  I'd quit my job, which I'm okay doing. We recently had a sit down about watching him and my daughter and husband gave me a list of rules, one they stressed was no animals around the baby.  That one was a bit of a surprise and conflicts with the needs of my other daughter. I asked why, they cited safety.  I accepted them, because I want to watch my grandson and be involved in his life.  My other daughter that travels for work has a pair of dogs. When she is out of town, she drops the dogs off with me.  The dogs can be a bit rambunctious but otherwise behaved.  She is usually gone 3 days at a time, usually midweek.  So the time that I watch the dogs would conflict with my grandson.  I've been watching her dogs for 3 years.  I've informed her that I want to watch my Grandson and because of that I can't watch the dogs as much anymore.  Well she did not take that news well and flipped out.  Says it isn't fair that she now has to find other means to take care of the dogs and it is financially affecting her. I told her I can stop by and check on them in the evenings, but I won't have the time to properly take care of her dogs if they were left at her place. She hasn't spoken to me or her sister in the past week.    So was i the asshole here?",

His widow/wife aka sister inlaw has never really been on good terms with my inlaws/her inlaws. They were having issues in the past and now from what I gather, my mother inlaw is planning on going to court for grandparents rights to get visitation of the kids. My inlaws had been asking my sister inlaw to give them my brother inlaw's wedding ring so they could keep it. She refused and they got into a huge argument then she left with the kids. They went over to her home yesterday hoping to take the ring from her but she told them she didn't have it, and that she buried it with my brother inlaw. When my parents inlaw mentioned this and were devastated, I suggested that she might just be lying to get them to drop it. Suddenly, they got up and quickly got into their cars and went over to her house and had another huge argument there. Sister inlaw called me later cussing at me saying I was horrible to be basically meddling in her life and encouraging my inlaws to come after her and harrass her. I argued that I only made a suggestion and that her real issue was with them. She hung up after telling me to mind my own business and stop getting involved. My husband berated me for what I said and said that his parents are crazy, and that I shouldn't approve of their behavior or even help them harrass my grieving sister inlaw. I mean my parents inlaw are also grieving and I, too, am grieving and my sister inlaw's words hurt me when all I did was just make a suggestion when I saw how devastated my parents inlaw were.

He had no problem with that, and he still drinks with his friends, but won't do that in my presence. It still bothers me that he drinks, but it's his life, I can't tell him what to do. Fast forward to last Sunday, and we're at his apartment. I come in, and he's in the middle of making pasta sauce, and there's a large bottle of vodka on the counter. I didn't say anything about the bottle, but he saw me staring at it, and he told me it's for the sauce. Pasta sauce he's made me at least twice a month for the entirety of our relationship. He said he's told me from the beginning he does that, that it cooks away, but I think that would be something I would very much remember, and I got a little angry. I knocked the bottle off the counter and went to my mom's. He's called and apologized for triggering me, and that he was being brainless, but he wants me to pay for the broken bottle, which he says was about an $80 brand. I told him that I wasn't under any circumstances going to pay for something he's been lacing my food with for years. We haven't really talked since, and my mom wants me to just go ahead and buy the thing to make amends, and I'm still refusing. AITA? Edit: I didn't smash the bottle, I pushed it off the counter and it broke. I didn't throw it.  Edit2: alright, I get it. I'm going to get him $80 worth of stuff to make up for it.

        "selftext": "So my 20 year old daughter is currently a college student. She lives in my house free of rent. I only ask her to do a few things around the house from time to time, like cooking and cleaning. Typical things you're expected to do on a daily basis anyways. Occasionally she has to watch over her younger brothers since I may be busy with work or when I need a break to hang out with my girlfriend.  My daughter recently spoke up to me about how she feels I'm putting too much of a workload on her back which I don't see how. She told me she's okay with cooking and cleaning around the house, but having to watch over her siblings was annoying & stressful and that it's taking away from her studies. That pissed me off because I myself went to school while having to pay bills & take care of her as a baby alongside my ex-wife. I told her she was acting very privileged and that if I could do it, so could she. She didn't like that very much and stormed off into her room.  Well she went behind my back and told my sister about how bad I was treating her. My sister is very kind & gullible at times, so she called me and said the least I could do was give her an allowance for the chores I make her do. I explained why I felt that wasn't necessary and she told me not to compare my situation to my Daughter's since apparently I put myself in the position I was in back then which I guess is a fair argument. But since she is living in my house rent free and I'm paying for her college, I feel that in of itself should count as an allowance. So I just wanted to ask whether I'm wrong for not wanting to pay her extra money to do basic chores. Edit: So in regards to how often I ask her to babysit, it's usually 3 times a week. I don't see how that's too much to ask of her. It's usually only for a few hours until I get back home. My boys are twins & they're 5 years old. They aren't crazy kids by the way, they're more mature than the typical one's you'll see.",

I do have one friend \u201cMel\u201d (20f) that I had to exclude from the wedding.

Now as an adult, I feel like I have a responsibility to prevent underage drinking, and as the bride, I feel like I have the right to have a childfree wedding. Mel is unconvinced and keeps talking bad about me behind my back to our mutual friends and making snarky comments about me feeling superior.

I caved in eventually but told him we'd have a small, secret celebration so that my family wouldn't find out. He agreed. The next day, I got a call from mom and she was so upset saying that my word meant nothing and that I have no respect for my brother's memory nor the family. I asked what she meant and she told me she saw the birthday party pics my husband posted on social media. I was to shocked to even argue. I hung up and went straight to my husband to confront him about it. He got defensive and said that he didn't need my permission to post pics, and that he wanted to show his family the birthday celebration pics since I insisted we have a small, secret party and exclude them. I explained to him how this made me look bad and a liar to my family but he said they can get over it and called my mom snooby. I blew up at him and we had a huge fight about it. He started sulking later and said I ruined the memory of our daughter's first birthday for him and verbally abused him with how I lashed out. But I solely did it out of frusrtation knowing that what happened caused a massive problem between me and family. Now he's expecting an apology from me. AITA?",

        "selftext": "My ex husband and I share custody of our 10 year old daughter and 12 year old son. We have a 2-2-3 schedule which usually looks like I have the kids Friday after school and then he gets them Monday after school. I get them back Wednesday after school and then he gets them Friday after school and then the week flip flops. We've done this since our divorce 5 years ago and it works well. I'm a nurse in the OR so I schedule my shifts for the days during the week when they are with their dad and my one call weekend every 6 weeks is a weekend they are with their dad.  Recently, the kids said they want to try splitting up on the weekends, so instead of both of them being with one us during the weekend, one will go with dad and one will be with me. My son said he would make sure he was with me on call weekends because he can stay by himself if I have to get called in or can hang out at the hospital until I'm done. My ex is on board with this because he says it will allow us to spend one on one time with the kids and will allow the kids a break from each other (they squabble occasionally and annoy one another). While they have a point- sometimes it is hard to not feel like you are disappointing one by trying to accommodate the other, I do not want to give up my free weekends. It took me a few months to get used to not having my kids all the time after the divorce but now my weekends without them are filled with activities or travel. My ex agreed if there was a weekend trip I wanted to take he would be fine having both the kids that weekend but I honestly don't want to have to take his schedule into consideration when planning my trips, and sometimes they are spontaneous trips.  I was talking to my family about this at breakfast this morning and they are all kind of appalled by me not wanting to do this. My sister pointed out that if I was still married, then I wouldn't have all the child free time I have now and many mothers don't get a break from their kids like I do. My mom said she can't believe I'd deny my children quality time with their parents for selfish reasons like not wanting to give up my weekends. My SIL seemed to understand where I was coming from but said that she would still do it and just incorporate the child into whatever I was doing and pointed out my daughter would love to go on the NYC shopping trip I had planned for December and my son would happily join me for my Saturday morning spin classes. I considered that but my SIL loves taking her kids everywhere so I don't know that she is aware of how nice it is to just be an adult without the responsibility of a child wherever you go. They were really making me feel like an asshole though. AITA?",

So few weeks ago a lady had booked me for a party makeup on June 25th. She booked at 10am. I went there thinking I'd do a regular party makeup. I had agreed $150 with her. As I was there, there were some people coming over. I assume relatives. At some point it slips from a woman about the wedding and I realise the woman I'm doing the makeup on is the bride. I'm doing a bridal makeup charging for simple party makeup. I was completely pissed how she lied about the occasion but I kept doing my job. After we were finished. She gave me $150 and I notified her we are actually $350 short. She asked what I meant by that and I said that I did a bridal makeup. You're the bride. That's what I charge for bride's. She said we had agreed on a simpla party makeup and that I am basically ripping her off because I worked the same amount of time and used the same products as I'd use in a bridal makeup so the title of the event shouldn't matter. I told her she doesn't get to dictate how I form my prices. She then refused to pay me at all and called me a scammer and told me to get out. Before I left her mom threw $200 on my face and told me to get lost. I was telling what happened to my friends and they all sided with the bride and said that unless I used more expensive products and I did extra labor then I'm not justified in charging her more and since she requested party makeup I should just charge her that.

If they are worried about their kid they should get a sitter and leave him at home. My gf got pissed and said I was being unreasonable because the flu shot was inexpensive and you can easily get them at a CVS. I am all about vaccinations, but I am not a fan of being told I need to do something for someone else's peace of mind. Edit: Quick edit, that I thought was obvious. I am not going to go if the baby will be there, and I don't have my shot. I don't want to get a baby sick/possibly die. I may still be the A**hole, but I am not heartless.

Instead of watching I should\u2019ve said taking care of the house and kids. Her going to the beach is what I thought she wanted to do for Mother\u2019s Day and me taking care of everything was enough because we pretty much split everything 50/50, she cooks more and I clean more. She wasn\u2019t expecting gifts but acknowledgement of her is what she was looking for but again her being gone that day I thought that it didn\u2019t mean that much and wasn\u2019t expecting anything. She didn\u2019t speak to me for 4 days after I apologized. Eventually we talked it out and admitted my mistakes for not communicating with her.

She instantly tells me that she doesn't know why he never changed it but I can decline or sign the cheque over to her once I receive it.. Instantly I am in shock, he's gone? And he left me on there? Why? I went back and forth wondering if this was on purpose or accidental.. it had been years, approximately 6 since we mutually civily split up. I was informed he had a new gf that lived with him and she has 2 kids from a previous relationship that threw a wrench into things more.. is there a reason she never got put on it? Was this all just a big mistake? Today it has been 1 week and this has been very hard especially since his mom has been terrorizing me all week trying to get me to agree to give her this money. She has said the most hurtful things, and has sent me the most disrespectful photos and video of her son in his last moments..As of right now I haven't even gotten in touch with the insurance company, I have no idea how much this is or if I need a lawyers help at this point.  Well today is the day I woke up knowing 100% I am keeping this money and I am not going to feel bad at all for helping my family with a gift my ex left for me. Unfortunately part of me still wonders if it's the right thing to do by my ex.. and if these were his wishes in the end. A little info too add, my home burnt too the ground 3 years ago July 20th and October 1st 2 years ago my mom passed from cancer as well... it has been a long hard few years and this money would literally buy myself a new bra for the first time in 3 years.. my little clan could really use this money and I think my ex knew that..

        "selftext": "I am 19M, and my sister (22F) got married about a week ago. She was rather mean to me growing up, and I still don't like her very much. Several months ago, we were all having dinner as a family. I was asked by my sister if I could be the organist for her wedding. She told me that she can't pay me, but that I can have food at the buffet. Since most of the gigs that I do are paying ones, I initially said that she's going to have to pay me. But my parents got mad at me and told me that it's unreasonable to expect family to pay me for playing music. I asked my sister if there'll be vegan options for her buffet, and she told me that she'll make sure that there will be. So I gave in and agreed to play as long as she has vegan options for me. When I arrived on the day of the wedding, my sister came over and told me that she wasn't able to get any vegan options for the buffet, so she got an Impossible Whopper for me from Burger King on her way there. Not only was that completely insulting, it has mayo in it so it isn't even vegan. I told her that I'm not going to play for the wedding unless she sends me $200 on Venmo right now. She went and discussed it with her fianc\u00e9, only to be told that she can't do that. So I immediately left the wedding and muted my sister, her fianc\u00e9, and my parents on my phone. There was no music for the wedding ceremony. I went to go see a movie with my friends instead. When I got home, my parents were predictably very angry and screaming at me. But I refused to apologize. I honestly don't care that much what they think anymore at this point because I'm already moving out in less than a month. My sister is now demanding that I reimburse her $2500 for the organ rental, and is threatening to take me to small claims court. I told her to pound sand because not only was there no contract, she didn't even uphold her end of our verbal agreement.",

My eldest is married to Steve while my youngest is engaged to Adam. Steve and Adam are so different they disliked each other the first time they met. Steve works part time because he treasures family time with my daughter. They spend their time traveling and exploring different parts of the states. He spends freely because he often say he can\u2019t take his money with him when he dies.  Adam is an executive and for his side business, he owns several dozen properties. He works about 80 hours a week at both jobs because his philosophy is that he wants to make as much money as possible while he\u2019s young so that he can retire early. Steve thinks Adam is a corporate shill and basically blames him for everything that\u2019s wrong with society. Steve said that Adam is actively keeping people from buying homes and making them dependent on him. Adam thinks Steve is a slacker and have told Steve people like him who does the bare minimum but expects hand outs are what\u2019s wrong with society. Neither of them are bad and they treat my daughters well.  I retired last year due to my health so Adam built a house for me so that I can live comfortably. I was able to customize everything in the house to fit my taste. Adam owns the house, pays for all of the utilities, and charges me $1 a month for rent. Part of our deal is that no one else can live in the house but me. He was very clear about this. Steve recently lost his job so he and my eldest are living off of her single income. As you can imagine, they are struggling. My eldest recently called me crying because their savings are almost gone and they can\u2019t make next month\u2019s rent. She asked if she and Steve could move in with me until he finds another job. I live on a fixed income so I don\u2019t have money to set them up in another apartment. She\u2019s my daughter and I couldn\u2019t let her be homeless so I let Steve and her move in. I gave them strict rules and a time limit on when they had to move out. I didn\u2019t think my youngest and Adam would find out because they live in another state but somehow she found out. She called and screamed at me last night for betraying Adam\u2019s trust but I argued that I\u2019m a mother to 2 daughters and I can\u2019t let one be homeless. I told her about the rules and time limit and begged her not to tell Adam. She hung up on me so I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen. I know I went back on an agreement but I had a good reason. Edit I couldn\u2019t add many details in my original post because I was afraid of going over the character limits.  Adam pays the taxes and utilities on this house but because it\u2019s the only house he has in this state, he keeps its financials separate from the rest of his properties. Also, he doesn\u2019t really have anything to do with the house. Instead, he gave it over to my youngest to take care of so she handles all of the bills and maintenance and pays them out of an account he set up. She noticed the increased utility cost which is when she called.  We just spoke again and I laid my soul bare to her. I knew I was going back on our agreement but it was to keep her sister from being homeless. We had a lengthy conversation and in the end, she agreed not to tell Adam. She\u2019ll cover the increased utility cost out of her own pocket so he won\u2019t notice it. In exchange, her sister and Steve will have 3 months then will have to move out. I originally told them they had 6 months.  I\u2019m lucky to have such a compassionate daughter. Thank you for taking the time to read my post. Some of the comments were very hurtful but some were helpful. You made me realize I should have called my youngest at the start and asked. That would have saved alot of tears.",

My husband uses Reddit and thought this sub would provide a third insight that we are missing. My husband (42M) and I (40F) have 2 daughters: Jane (22F) and Lisa (5F). This concerns Jane who has been struggling with the cold. Jane started to complain about the temperature of the house now it\u2019s no longer summertime. Currently, we leave the central heating off all the time apart from in the early morning (5-7am) so Lisa doesn\u2019t get too cold when she is awake. My husband and I don\u2019t have an issue with the temperature of the house (its approx 16C at night across all of the bedrooms since we checked in case her room was draftier), we don\u2019t really feel it and do not see where Jane is coming from. Jane complains and says she wears multiple layers to bed and around the house while we are all asleep. So, she asked if she could have access to the thermostat in order to switch the heating on at a higher temperature than 18C (what we set it as). She wants to raise it to 21C but we said no. She keeps complaining about how she has to wear 4 layers to bed so she doesn\u2019t feel cold in the morning. Lisa says it isn\u2019t cold when we ask her, my husband and I also don\u2018t feel the cold so we said no to her asking and thought that would put an end to it. It did not. We had dinner at my parents house in which Jane was making comments about how warm and toasty her grandparents\u2019 house is. My parents were shocked that we didn\u2019t allow her access to the thermostat and they tried to sway us into giving her access because it isn\u2019t right for her to sleep in multiple layers. My sister also agreed with them and said my daughter has valid points since the temperature is starting to drop in the night. Are we wrong here?    Hello everyone and thank you for all your feedback. I did not realise there were so many reasons as to why my daughter potentially could be cold and that layering may not work in those cases. We reached a compromise with our daughter: she can have a small heater for her room with a timer so I am 100% sure it is not left on overnight for my own peace of mind. We are also going to buy her a heavier duvet and thicker mattress topper to prevent cold from underneath the bed. Thank you all. ",

        "selftext": "My (27F) fiance (29M) is an extremely picky eater, and lately, I\u2019ve been feeling really frustrated with his extreme pickiness when it comes to food. He has a very limited diet and refuses to try anything outside of his comfort zone. He doesn't eat meat or vegetables, his diet typically consists of stuff like pizza, macaroni, cereal, and bread with the occasional fruit on the side. This has made it extremely frustrating whenever we eat out. If we're getting something to eat, we have to only go to places that serve anything he wants, which limits our options to mostly just fast food or pizza places. He's offered to go out to other restaurants with me, but he never ends up ordering anything when we do and it's extremely embarrassing. He never eats anything I cook, and typically just sticks to making his own food. This came to a head when we visited my parents last week. We sat down to eat together, they know he doesn't eat meat so prepared a vegetable dish. When we were eating, he only ate a small portion of it, and I could tell from how little he had eaten he wasn't going to finish it. My parents asked what was wrong, and he thanked them for the food, but said he just wasn't that hungry and ended up just fiddling with the rest of it and threw most of it out after dinner. I was mortified. On the way back, he wanted to stop and get food and I kind of laid into him. I told him he embarrassed me, was rude to my parents to not eat the dish, and that he seriously needs to grow up and stop eating like a manchild. This isn't the first time we've had an argument about this, but it is the first time I've been this mad. Last summer we visited my extended family at my uncle's lakehouse, and he basically only ate frozen pizza and cereal the three days we were there, which caused issues since my nieces and nephews were there and I felt it set a bad example for them. He got really hurt and hasn't talked to me much for the past few days. I feel bad, but at the same time, I'm just tired of this. So, AITA? I feel I could have been nicer and more accomodating, but it's not like he has a medical condition that forces him to eat this way. I'm just so tired with him not even being willing to try and continuing to eat like a 5 year old.",

        "selftext": "For context: I 39, got married to my wife Nelly 36, months ago. I have to say that Nelly and my daughter (her stepdaughter) Megan 16, never gotten along. They have lots of disagreements and nothing in common and it was obvious since the first say they met but I didn't do anything about it thinking they'd move past their differences and warm up to each other the longer they spend time together. I was wrong because once we moved in together the fights got worse. Nelly would complain from Megan throwing away stuff of her's just because she thought it didn't belong there. It's been basically a mouse and cat game and I've lost track on who's right and who's wrong. I did try tk establish some boundaries to try to bring back peace to my home and had them agree that each stays in their own lane and not bother each other. Nelly said that I was wrong tk think that what Megan is doing is okay but I told her to let it slide. Nelly has especial type of haircare products for her sensitive hair. Shampoo, conditioner etc etc. She put them in the bathroom but Megan ended up throwing them away saying that Nelly had no right to store her products in the bathroom cause it's not her house. To keep the peace I asked Nelly to just keep her stuff in the bedroom and take it with her whenever she wants to take a shower to which she agreed. Last night Nelly took a shower and forgot her hair products in the bathroom. Megan ended up going in there and then the shampoo collection was gone. Nelly freaked out and then had a fight after Megan told her she dumped them out saying she already warned her about leaving her stuff laying around in the bathroom. Nelly broke down and when I said I choose to stay out of this because of how petty it was, she blew up at me. She yelled about how I keep letting Megan get away with bad attitude and unjustified misbehavior. Told me to stop enabling her and start setting consequences for her actions. I told her she shouldve been more careful knowing how Megan is so I feel like this was preventable. but she said that she forgot her stuff there and didn't think Megan would go that far. We had an argument and that was it. Megan is acting nonchalant sdespite me talking to her and Nelly went tj stay with her parents saying I need to step up and do something.",

        "selftext": "Throwaway because. Last weekend was my (M28) birthday. My girlfriend (F25) had asked what I wanted to do and I said I wanted to watch my favorite movie trilogy, LOTR. I don't think my girlfriend was thrilled but she didn't say anything and agreed. She has seen them before and I don't think she really likes them very much but she knows I love them so she doesn't really say anything besides they aren't really her thing.  But I really wanted to make a day of watching them and I went over to her house because she has a really big comfortable couch.  About ten minutes into the first movie and I look over and she is browsing on her phone. I was a little miffed but didn't say anything. She basically scrolled through her phone the entire movie. When we started the second movie, she opened a bottle of wine and proceeded to drink the whole thing, while still sitting on her phone. I was pretty irritated at this point because she wasn't even paying attention at all.  The third movie started and by then she had opened another bottle of wine and was asleep within the first twenty minutes. I was really mad at that point and just left and went home.  A few hours later I got a text asking where I went. I told her I was mad that she couldn't pay attention to my favorite movies on my birthday. She told me I was an asshole and to grow the hell up. I've texted her a couple times but she hasn't responded. AITA? Edit: This has really blown up and I've gotten a little overwhelmed, but I do accept that I was the asshole. Watching 9 hours of movies that she hates was definitely too much of an ask and I shouldn't have reacted the way I did. I just took it personally because I felt like she didn't even try and these movies are important to me. The fact that she isn't much of a drinker and drank this much kind of set me off. I called and left her a voicemail apologizing.",

He's made it clear he is just not interested in spending time with his nephew, keeps saying that the reason for that is that he's actually child free. for so many emergencies he has turned me and my wife away when we begged him to watch our son  and he didn't even budge or apologize for his attitude. it all came to head a couple of days ago, I had a work meeting while my wife was out of town and my inlaws were attending a wedding so no one was free to watch my son except for my BIL. I showed up to his place and told him I was desperate for help and needed him to just watch my son for 2 hours. he refused, even suggested I take him with me to work but that's not a good suggestion. I begged him and he just said no. I had enough I confronted him and asked why? does he not like his nephew and he threw that no it's just that I'm child free excuse which made me lose it. I told him to just stop because it's cringe of him to keep saying that and use it as an excuse to be unsupportive of me and his sister and cold towards his nephew. I told him he should really do better and stop being so negative but he got mad and said I had no right to disrespect his lifestyle/choices but it's the attitude that gets me. we had a exchange of words where he said my son isn't his responsibility whatsoever then I left. he complained to my inlaws and they called me out for disrespecting their son and treating him like that. They insisted that he's not responsible for my son and I shouldn't expect so much from him then guilt him about it. they wanted me to apologize and my wife said I should but he was about as helpful and supportive as a rock so, I decided I will take my time before I consider apologizing.

        "selftext": "My 24 f bridsemaid / cousin Ella 26 f is to be in my wedding party in June. The ongoing issue is that my wedding has a blue and green peacock theme and guests have been asked to follow this colour scheme with their clothes. Hair wasn't originally included at all in the colour scheme but my cousin Ella has natural bright ginger hair. I would never ask someone to permemnantly change their hair for my wedding,  I know that would be bonkers so I suggested some temporary hair dye, but Ella argued that she has been growing her hair for 6 years and doesn't want to risk the colour not washing out. I thought this was ridiculous because it literally says washes out in like 14 washes.But Ella says because her hair is completely natural colour it might take strongly to her hair.  So I gave up on that avenue and suggested a wig, it is 1 day 1 single day and there are some amazing wigs these days,  I had a look on Instagram and you wouldn't even be able to tell. But she said she would feel self conscious and weird wearing a wig and that because her hair is butt length that it might sit weird on her head.So she won't dye it,  and won't cover it up. I really don't want to come across as a bridezilla but butt length flaming red hair will destroy the wedding photos,  and ruin the colour scheme completely.  Im at a loss, I can't cut her from the wedding because my mom would murder me but I can't have freaking Merida ruining the photos, AITA for asking this of her for just 1 single day? tl;dr   bridesmaid has flaming red hair and refusing to hide it for one single day for my wedding that has a colour scheme it will clash with aita EDIT: Ella has dropped out of the wedding because we couldn't reach a compromise so it doesn't matter anymore. I now have to deal with my mom and aunt chewing me out over it all. EDIT: OK I get it jesus iata please leave it be now, I decided to link ella this post as it hit twitter and i was worried she would hear about it anyway,  we will be working to reach a compromise.",

I don't work so I don't have everything I need for my daily skin/hair routine so I borrow stuff from Claire. Claire didn't have an issue in the beginning but then started complaining about me randomly walking into her room but I go in there looking for the stuff I asked for. She gave me a hard time just because I walked in on Thomas half naked to get the eye shadow I borrowed from her. and then that other time when I walked in late at night. She told me I nedded to get her permission to enter the room before I take anything but I figured this would make things complicated. It's enough that I have to ask to borrow an item. So, last night at around 10pm I went upstairs and into her bedroom to grab the hair dryer. I walked it and woops, I saw them in an intimate position together in bed. I had NO IDEA they're were doing it, especially since Claire told me that Thomas has been feeling sick the past 2 days. She lashed out at me yelling that I get out. I quickly grabbed the hair dryer then walked out and shut the door. minutes later, She came downstairs in her robe and went off on me saying she was done with me repeatedly disrespecting and violating hers and her husband's privacy. I told her it was cool, no big deal. and that I needed the dryer but didn't have time to ask for permissin. She got even louder saying I had no business barging into her marital space and embarrassing her and her husband like this. I told her that I was sorry but she really overreacted to this whole thing. This made her more pissed she went on about how I'm living here rent free and yet not being respectable enough. I stopped arguing and went to my room. This morning, Thomas left the house early amd Claire ignored me on breakfast. Still upset saying I don't get to say wether she overreacted or not and that my behavior was inappropriate. She even wants me to apologize to her husband for making last night awkward.",

        "selftext": "My MIL has made a small family quilt for all of her kids and their spouses (5 couples including us). The quilt is really cute, has the couple's names, their kids' names, and their favorite hobbies and things all done in stitching and cute little cloth pictures. I was really looking forward to getting ours because I admit I'm a bit of a hipster and I love home-made kitschy stuff like that for our home. She recently finished her latest one for my husband's brother and I thought we were getting ours soon since my husband is the youngest. I asked my SIL (she got hers first) and she very awkwardly informed me that no such quilt will be coming our way. I was a bit upset and asked my husband to investigate. Turns out MIL has no intention of making a quilt for us because there's not enough to put on all the squares or whatever, basically meaning since we don't have kids we don't deserve a quilt because she can't be bothered. I message her directly about it because I'm just that kind of person. I like hearing it straight from the other guy. MIL says her fingers hurt after the first 4 quilts and she's taking a break. I ask her if it has anything to do with the fact that we have no kids (which she expressed negativity against in the past) and she says no even though I know it's a lie. I push her more and ask her when she thinks the quilt will be done after her little break and she kind of loses her temper and says there's no quilt and there never will be a quilt. I ask why and she says she's only interest in making quilts with her grandkids and things on them and we don't have enough hobbies and kids' hobbies to fill up a whole quilt. I tell her we have 2 beautiful dogs whom we love and could be put on there and she says I'm not making a whole quilt for a couple of goddamn dogs verbatim. I hang up and tell my husband and he's 100% on my side. But now I got a really mean voice message from my SIL telling me that I crossed the line and am acting like a huge B*tch for no reason. I'm shocked because I have a great relationship with my SIL and she always defended me from other family bullshit. My husband wants no part in this now. AITA for what I said to my MIL?",

This friend's parents were doing my wife and I a huge favor, because my wife's father had surgery yesterday, and we needed to be there and didn't get home until after midnight. So yes, this story begins with us already in debt to them. Anyway, at naptime today my son started freaking out because he couldn't find sleepy Dumbo (his stuffed animal) and he *cannot* sleep without sleepy Dumbo. I remembered that when I picked him up I didn't see sleepy Dumbo. So I text the mom and dad of the friend. I get no response. My wife is a wreck, so I'm not bothering her with this, but my son is freaking out. So I tell him we will get in the car and go get sleepy Dumbo and he slightly calmed down. So we drive over and I try to call them both on the way. When we get there, I knock, and we wait a bit with no answer. At this point my son starts freaking out more because he is afraid something happened to sleepy Dumbo. I try to reassure him, but he starts crying. I knock again, and the wife of the couple answers. She says she is working and asks what I want. I explain about sleepy Dumbo. She again says she is working, and she says she doesn't have time to look for Dumbo and tells us to come back later. My son starts freaking out more. I ask if we can look. She says she needs to focus. I promise to be fast. She lets me in. We get to his friend's room, sleepy Dumbo is on the bed. My son gets him, and I hustle us out. I thank the mom, but she is glaring at me. On the way home he hugs sleepy Dumbo the whole time. I remind him to be more careful with sleepy Dumbo in the future, and at home naptime commences peacefully. About an hour ago my wife and I both got this text. I'm going to copy paste it: {Me} and {my wife} I really don't appreciate the way {me} barged into my house earlier today while I was working. I know you both have a lot going on right now but the world doesn't revolve around you. {Her husband} and I agreed to do you a favor but that doesn't mean you get to just walk all over us. In the future if you call and we don't answer that means it isn't a good time to come over. I felt very embarrassed and guilty after reading that. My wife, however, is furious. She called the wife of the other couple some indelicate names. I am really grateful to them for agreeing to babysit for us, and I accept that I am to blame for forgetting sleepy Dumbo the first time. I don't know if asking to come in and get him is quite as big a deal as she's making it out though, and my wife is pissed. I don't know how much of that is misplaced fear for her dad though.

Alice has four kids and is currently expecting child number five, while Miranda can\u2019t have children which her ex divorced her for. Miranda is very successful in life, she has a nice apartment, works a good job and earns a decent amount of money. Alice, on the other hand, is struggling financially. She had her first kid right out of high school and got pregnant with her second child soon after, so she decided to become a SAHM to her children while her boyfriend provides for them. Me and my parents try to help them out as much as possible, be it childcare or money, whatever she needs. I love my nieces and nephews. I take them to the park and play with the older ones, I really enjoy it. Miranda doesn\u2019t help out with them, she says it\u2019s because she\u2019s too busy. Well, she works long hours, but she doesn\u2019t have kids, so I don\u2019t know what she does on weekends. She also doesn\u2019t help out financially, which I find unfair, since she makes so much money and all she does is spend it on herself, although she does give us very nice gifts for Christmas and birthdays. My parents nag her about it, saying she should give some of her money to Alice monthly, and I agree with that. So, here comes the part where I may have been an asshole. I was at Miranda\u2019s place last week, as she baked muffins and invited me over to eat some and catch up. We got on the topic of Christmas presents and I told her some of the stuff I wanted. She nodded and said she would give our parents a coupon for a much needed vacation and Alice some clothes she had mentioned and also some new boots and jackets for her kids. I was a little stunned she didn\u2019t have more for Alice, so I asked, \u201cWhy do you only get Alice the bare minimum? You can afford to help out more and you refuse to out of spite.\u201d Miranda looked at me and laughed. She said it wasn\u2019t her business to feed six people, that Alice was old enough to make her choices and live with the consequences. She knew what she was getting herself into and that she wouldn\u2019t pay Alice\u2019s way through life just because she kept having children she couldn\u2019t afford. I was stunned at how cold she reacted. I asked her how she could live her life being so selfish and uncaring, and she got angry and told me, \u201cListen, kid, there are some thing you are way too young for to be discussing with me, and this is one of those. Drop the subject or get out.\u201d I got really frustrated with her and said something I probably shouldn\u2019t have. I told her, \u201cNo wonder your husband divorced you, even if you could have children, you would be a terrible mother.\u201d Miranda got very quiet and told me to leave and never come back. She has now blocked me on everything, and though I don\u2019t agree with her not helping out, I\u2019m starting to feel guilty for what I said. So, AITA?",

This has worked out well so far, but lately it has been taking a toll on me. I pay Hannah child support every month, ever since Stacey had our first child she has demanded that I give her the same amount of money each month to keep things fair. In addition, I have to pay for half of our joint household expenses (ie mortgage, utilities, food) and my own car. Stacey pays for the majority of expenses for our children.  Here lies the problem. Stacey has never taking issues with having to care for mine and Hannah's children. She picks them up from school, takes them to activities, and ensures they have everything they need. However, anytime she purchases anything for them, she immediately sends me a Venmo request and demands I cover all expenses related to children that are not hers. We recently went on a family vacation and she demanded that I pay for half of the portion for our children and all of the portion for Hannah's. I told her that all theses expenses are taking a hit in my finances and she didn't seem to care. She reiterated that my children are my responsibility. To add insult to injury, she recently started contributing money to college funds for her kids, while Hannah and I have nothing saved for our kids' college. Hannah found out and asked that I start funds for our kids. When I talked with Stacey about this, she said this was fine, but I had to put the same amount of money in the funds she has set up for our kids. I told Stacey I need her to start paying her fair share of expenses around our household. I cannot afford to pay child support, household expenses, and all these miscellaneous expenses that come up for my kids. It wouldn't hurt her financially, as she makes more than me and could easily spare some money. Stacey blew up and took our children to her parent's house and I haven't heard from her in a day and a half. Am I the asshole for demanding that she pay her fair share?",

The houses also stick out horribly in terms of aesthetics \u2013 think single level brick homes with a 3-level gigantic white and black box in the middle. My home\u2019s been in my family for several generations. We have always been known for having a large, beautiful garden. We invited over kids to help with gardening, we gave away so many veggies, we\u2019d hold parties, etc. It\u2019s been a neighborhood treasure for years. Until developers snatched up the lot next door, bulldozed and erected an enormous house that blocked out the light to most of the garden. Many of us tried to fight it with the city but everything was denied. It was heartbreaking. Our neighborhood has been changed forever. This was a link to my family and I almost have had to go through a grieving process for it. The new owners moved in and were not welcomed warmly by people in the neighborhood. I avoided them for as long as I could, other than politely waving or nodding. It was a young couple in their early 20s. We finally came face to face and the woman asked if we could chat. She said that they felt like maybe they\u2019d done something wrong when they moved in, or if they aren\u2019t pulling in their trash bins or something, being too loud, etc, because people haven\u2019t been very friendly. The guy says that he\u2019s surprised considering it felt like a \u201cnice\u201d and somewhat \u201caffluent\u201d neighborhood, and given the price, he was expecting friendly neighbors. I asked if they had done any research about the area. They said that they moved from California, so no. I said that maybe that was their mistake? They said they didn\u2019t know what I meant, so I asked if they\u2019d ever looked in our backyard. They said yes and said they think the garden is cute. I said \u201cYes, the garden that now has about half less sunlight than before that house was built was a neighborhood treasure. The guy said \u201cWell it\u2019s not our fault you built the garden there, is it?\u201d I said \u201cWell, you guys got what you paid for. 2 million dollars for a house that everyone in the neighborhood hates.\u201d I said that I hoped it was worth it and wished them a nice day.

I don't have any issue with my brother being gay, but I have one with him wearing a wedding ring in order to pretend that he's married to him. You see, we live in a country where gay marriage still isn't allowed (Romania), but despite this, my brother and his boyfriend started wearing weddings rings recently. When I asked my brother about it, he told me that despite not being able to do it legally, they already consider themselves married spiritually and they're hoping that one day gay marriages will be allowed to do legally as well, either by leaving the country or waiting till gay marriages are made legal here as well. While I think this nice, I told him that they shouldn't be wearing wedding rings till they actually get officially married, as I think it's kind of distasteful. He told me that they're just a symbol of their love and that they're not hurting anyone by wearing them, but I disagreed, they're actively misleading people into thinking that they're actually married and frankly just making a mockery out of marriage.  My brother told me that he doesn't care what other people, including me, think about them wearing wedding rings and maybe they should just mind their own business, then left furiously. Not gonna lie, I think his comment here was kind of out of line, as all I did was to give my opinion on people wearing wedding rings when they're actually married yet and he seemed to take it personally. His boyfriend also contacted me later and told me that their romantic lives doesn't concern me and to stay out of it. AITA ?",

Their mother and I agreed on a 50/50 custody arrangement after we split up and have stuck to it until this issue arose. My daughter hasn\u2019t spoken to me since last summer due to an argument she and I had about college.\r  \r  I have college funds for all 3 of my kids, and had an agreement with them that they would receive it after graduating high school as long as they attended a state university (not community college). I wanted to set them up for success later on, and I knew future employers would take them more seriously if their degree was from a legitimate 4-year college.\r  \r  Last Spring my daughter and I got into an argument about this. She was filling out financial forms for college and asked me for my tax returns. While we were going over the forms I noticed that she put down a local community college, and when I pointed it out she told me that her mother encouraged her to because they waived the tuition fees for first time college students so we wouldn\u2019t have to pay for any of it.\r  \r  I told her that she shouldn\u2019t be asking me for my information if she was going to use it to do something that I\u2019ve made clear I don\u2019t support. She told me that she thought I just meant I was against paying for it and I told her that I had been crystal clear and that she knew what I had meant, and that she was being sneaky and taking the easy way out.\r  \r  Eventually I stormed out. I figured that it would blow over by the next day, as it usually does when we have a fight. However, she told me a few days later that she reached out to the financial aid company and asked to submit the forms with only her mother\u2019s financial information. \r  \r  They ended up approving her request but it was a long process and didn\u2019t get completed until after the deadline to enroll in most universities for the fall semester. As a result, she wasn\u2019t able to start college last semester and ended up getting a job instead. My daughter told me that since I \u201cclearly wasn\u2019t going to help her\u201d, that she would move in with her mother full time after she turned 18 (which was during the summer) and she started college this semester.\r  \r  I told her that was ridiculous and that she was being petty, and that she sabotaged herself and if she had just enrolled in a real college like I told her to, she would\u2019ve been able to complete the paperwork without a problem. She told me that she hated me and was cold and distant to me until she moved out permanently.\r  \r  That was all during Spring and Summer of last year and my daughter hasn\u2019t spoken to me since. I pretty much forgot about it until my youngest son told me this morning that he misses her being there when they spend the week at my house and how he wishes I hadn't been so harsh. In retrospect, I might HAVE been too harsh with it. AITA?\r  \r  ",

Unlike a lot of women, she didn't have any reconstructive surgery. This was before I met her.  I'm a big anime nerd, and last weekend I invited her to a small anime con with me. She's seen a few episodes of my favorite shows, but she's not into anime; she does like cosplay, though, and she works seasonally as an SFX artist at a haunted house near us. So when I asked her to go to the con with me, she asked if she could cosplay, and I said sure. She got very excited and said I was going to love her costume, so I'll admit I thought she was going to do something sexy for me. Well, not exactly. The day of the convention comes, and she showed up at my house cosplaying Dabi from MHA- specifically a look he has later in the manga. It's a long white coat over white pants, no shirt. Her entire chest was exposed and she'd obviously spent hours applying burn makeup; she has short hair that she dyes constantly, this time she bleached it white and dyed a few red streaks.  I wasn't expecting her to show up without a shirt. Her burn scar makeup only covered half her chest, so you could clearly see her mastectomy scar. It wasn't a verry attractive costume, especially since she'd gone all out with the scars and made them look raised and kind of realistic.  We went to the con, and while a lot of people came up to take photos with her, I noticed several others looking at her chest. That evening, she said I'd been quiet all day, and I honestly told her I was a little embarrassed that she was flaunting her mastectomy scar like that. She got mad and said she was making the best of her situation and said I was being insensitive, and she's been distant ever since. I'm starting to feel guilty. AITA?",

For context, I have a 10 yo son Billy from my previous relationship and my ex isn't in the picture. I have to admit that Philip's relationship with my family isn't so great. They would disagree on a lot of things. For example, he had an argument with my dad when he said that he was keeping their grandson away from them but Philip stated he wasn't and that he couldn't visit with Billy because he had work (I was sick at the time). The latest argument was what made things worse. My mom and sister were discussing natural remedies (they're into this stuff) for my niece and Philip (he's a pediatrician) called both of them ignorant for not using meds instead which caused a huge argument and Philip being no longer welcome at my parents house. Now they'd sent me and Billy an invitation for Christmas but did not include Philip which, I expected given how strained their relationship has become. I called my mom to confirm that I'll attend but the minute Philip found out, he went off saying he could not believe I was fine with my family excluding him and then agree to go and leave him behind. I told him it's their celebration and I don't get to decide their guestlist for them. And also, I'm not leaving him behind because we did not have any plans for Christmas. He said he thought that we'd automatically celebrate together the 3 of us but now I'm taking Billy away from him as well. I thought that was a bit melodramatic because it's literally just few hours at my parents home but he insisted it was about principle and respect. We had a big argument and I said that he basically alienated himself by continually picking arguments with my family, but he started ranting saying it wasn't about the fact that they didn't invite him, but the fact that I was willing to let him spend Christmas alone without me and Billy. We went back and forth on the issue but do not seem to reach a solution. My parents are used to spending every major holiday with Billy.

I pointed out to her after splitting the gift card it would be way less then she spent on the costume and it was only a few hours but she didn\u2019t want to listen to reason.  Now a month later and she is still moody and mostly ignoring me. My ex husband told me I made her miss out and she works so much she missed out on a lot of stuff with her friends and I could have let her have this. But at the end of the day I saved her 80$. I just trying to teach my daughter how to be responsible with money she could have gotten a cheap costume especially since I she would have only worn it for a few hours.",

        "selftext": "Last week, I was using my sister Ashley\u2019s phone because mine was dead and I needed to call a friend to confirm plans. Dialing my friend\u2019s number, I saw a tinder notification of some dude messaging her. Immediately, I asked why she\u2019s on tinder (she\u2019s 17) and she grabbed her phone back and said \u201cnone of your business\u201d  I decided that I wanted to have a little fun with this. I wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt (maybe she\u2019s just swiping for fun?) so I didn\u2019t want to go straight to ratting her to our parents. To test if she was just using for fun, I decided I was going to make a tinder profile (of someone else) and message her and see if she responds. I asked a good friend from back in college (who happens to be a male model) Kevin if he\u2019d mind if I used his pictures and explained the situation. He thought it would be hilarious and told me to go for it.  I created the account, set my age to 22, set my swipe radius to a mile, and quickly found my sister\u2019s account. Her age was set to 19 (lie, she\u2019s still in **high school**) so I was definitely more suspicious of her now. I superliked and less than an hour later, she matched AND messaged me.  I decided to set up a date to a fancy restaurant downtown for Sunday afternoon and told her we could \u201chead to my place afterwards\u201d. She was completely receptive and said she\u2019d meet me there. She told our parents she was hanging out with one of her track friends and spending the night at her place.  After she left, I told our parents EVERYTHING and showed them all of the messages. They were pissed, and I suggested we all go to the restaurant. My dad and I just went instead and saw her sitting at a table alone all dolled up waiting for \u201cJim\u201d. My dad went up to her and said \u201cJim\u2019s not coming\u201d and she screamed and asked what we were doing there. I told her that there was no Jim and that it was fucking stupid of her to be trying to meet grown men on tinder at her age. My dad harped on to that and lectured her on lying and meeting strange men on the Internet, and being so willing to go back to a *stranger\u2019s* place. We were a bit loud so people were starting to look at us and my sister eventually bursted into tears and ran out.  I told my friends in a groupchat the situation and they all agreed it was hysterical, except 2 of my female friends who said I was a \u201cfucking dick\u201d and \u201ccruel\u201d to her. My other friends defended me and said she needed to be taught a lesson. Wondering who\u2019s right and if I went too far? EDIT: Yes, when I asked if she wants to go to my place afterwards, it was heavily implied that she would\u2019ve had sex with Jim. That\u2019s why I went the extent that I did. Alright after reading all these judgments, I came to the conclusion that I\u2019m TA. But I\u2019m TA she needed. If anything, she knows not to be a complete moron when finding people to hook-up with on tinder.  And to the people who said she\u2019ll never speak to me again, we just finished playing fifa for the last hour so \u00af_(\u30c4)_/\u00af",

        "selftext": "Hey I'm 29 my husband is 34. We have an 5 month old daughter. I have decided I want to become a veggie mainly for enviromental reasons. I've been considering doing this for some time as I think meat production has a hugely negative effect. Having our daughter has made me a bit more eco conscious as I am afraid of the world she'll live in in the future. I've been trying to reduce the meat in my diet for some time. My husband doesn't want to do this and complains every time I cook a meatless meal. I am a SAHM at and cook almost all of our meals. I've told him I don't want to cook meat anymore and that if he wants to eat meat then he can cook it himself and that he is lucky I am cooking for him everyday whatever I cook. However he says that I should also at least cook meat and add this to the meal for him. He says I can't force him to change his diet and eat less meat but I say that I'm not as he can still cook him meat. He says it is unfair on him to force this major lifestyle change on him. And he thinks I am being hypocritical and petty not cooking meat anymore when I've eaten it all my life. He thinks it is silly me not cooking meat for him if he is going to do it later, as I am just saving him from cooking meat and the amount of meat cooked will be the same so he thinks the only result in this is me not doing something nice for him. But I think doing that would be a massive inconvenience for me and also it defeats the purpose of me becoming veggie in the first place. I do kinda understand his point of view. He also is unhappy that I plan to cook veggie meals for our daughter and thinks it is unfair to force her into being a vegetarian but again i don't think I am as I don't plan on stopping her eating meat in school etc. Just wondering what y'all think about this?",

        "selftext": "My lovely girlfriend and I have been together for 8 months. She slept over at my place last night, and in the morning she woke me up saying she had went out and brought back a couple of lattes and pastries from a coffee shop around the corner from my apartment for breakfast. My issue with this is that my apartment has a two factor entry, first my student ID to scan in and then my key to get back into the apartment (it auto locks). I asked her how she was able to get back into the apartment and she said that she grabbed my keychain (which has my ID on it in a wallet type thing) before heading out to buy us breakfast so she would be able to get back in. I told her that I didn\u2019t appreciate her violating my privacy like that, and she got upset, saying that she was just trying to do something nice for me. We started to fight about it and I ended up asking her to leave. Since then, she hasn\u2019t answered any of my texts or calls. When I told my roommate about this he said that I was the asshole because she did something thoughtful for me and I yelled at her about it. I think she was violating my privacy by stealing my keys. AITA? Edit: I thought it was weird that she took my keys without asking, they could have gotten stolen or something while she was out, I get that she was being nice but why couldn\u2019t she have asked?? Edit 2: and no she still hasn\u2019t responded to me Edit: I\u2019m at work now obsessing but I know that I screwed up. I had a bad experience with privacy in my last relationship and i guess I\u2019m projecting or something. And no, my girlfriend hasn\u2019t responded to any of my voicemails or texts besides sending back money I tried to send her for the breakfast last night but she might not be awake yet, it\u2019s early in my time zone Final edit because people keep messaging me: long story short, she texted me and we met for coffee earlier this afternoon. I brought her flowers and apologized for being insane. We had a long talk about my privacy issues from my last relationship.  She chose not to break up with me, she will be getting lots of dates and back rubs in the future. Also, I am already in therapy but thanks for suggesting it",

        "selftext": "Okay just writing the title like that made me feel super guilty, but please hear me out before judging too harshly. I (38 F) have 4 kids ages 11 months, 3, 5, and 10. I love them all more than anything, but I\u2019ll be the first to admit that our house is constant chaos and it can get very exhausting. My sister (33F) is child free, but loves my kids and was happy to watch the older 2 or sometimes 3 to help me keep my sanity. This has been extremely helpful and I tell her all the time how grateful we are for her help. The thing is that the kids used to go over to her house, but right now they couldn\u2019t because my sister was fostering an elderly chihuahua. My sister claims she couldn\u2019t have them over for the time being because they would stress out the dog. Her dog was extremely frail and timid so I think this was a fair assessment. This was the 4th dog she has fostered, all of which couldn\u2019t be around my kids. This most recent dog took 8 months to find a home for, but most of her other dogs took even longer. When she told me she found an adopter I knew I could finally breathe a sigh of relief and joked about how I was so glad she could babysit again. My sister proceeded to tell me that there was a second dog that desperately needed a new foster, so she planned to take in that one as soon as her current dog was gone. So, she couldn\u2019t do anymore babysitting than she already is (sometimes she comes over to my house in the morning to help out). I could literally feel my stress levels spike. I haven\u2019t ever done this before, but I opened up to her about how much I have been struggling since she got the dog. How little sleep I get each night, how my husband hasn\u2019t been helping as much as he should, and some other deeply personal issues that I\u2019ve been struggling with. Then I asked her, point blank, to not get another dog. She comforted me, but ultimately didn\u2019t agree on anything and said she needed some time to think. I know I am asking a lot of her since rescuing dogs is her passion and that is why I feel so guilty. But I don\u2019t have anyone else to help me. I can\u2019t afford a babysitter long term, and my friends all have their own kids to look after. Above all, my kids will always come before a dog and that\u2019s the reason I was willing to request it. I\u2019ve told a few different people about the situation and gotten a wide range of heavily biased opinions. So that\u2019s why I decided to come on here and as you guys. Was this unreasonable? I would never demand her to do this if she didn\u2019t want to, but is it really so wrong to just be honest my situation and earnestly ask? Edit: I am grateful for the honesty from people respectfully telling me that what I did was wrong. However I have also read a lot of horrible assumptions from people as well and I\u2019d like to clear them up. I am not some careless mother who just keeps \u201cpopping out children\u201d that I can\u2019t take care of. My husband is not a deadbeat dad. After our youngest was born he got severe depression. He isn\u2019t out having fun while I\u2019m working 24/7, he is miserable. I went to my sister instead of him for help because I don\u2019t want to lose him. I love my kids and I have always made every one of my decisions with what I believe are their best interests in mind. And no I don\u2019t think my sister is obligated to do anything for me, I was asking for help not demanding it. Edit 2: Insulting my husband doesn\u2019t help anyone. Yes he is in therapy and is on antidepressants. Anyone who has actually dealt with depression would know that that isn\u2019t an instant cure all. Still my husband does the very best he can. I asked my sister because I needed more help than he can provide right now.",

However, my wife is often exhausted so I let my mom come over to help out with cleaning and stuff (I can barely have time to work) and also, at the same time, Spend time with the baby and bond with him a little bit. Thing is my wife acts strange whenever she sees my mom with our son. She'd make a face and talk to her in a descending tone, even raises her voice at her causing mom to feel hurt. I asked my wife about it and she said it was because of what my mom is doing. I asked her to elaporate and she complained about mom holding the baby for long and taking forever to give him back to her. mom argued that my wife could ask nicely instead of outright yelling but my wife defended herself saying that she only starts raising her voice after she's already asked a couple of times and mom won't listen. They started arguing and mom started crying. that's when I felt enraged,  pulled my wife aside and told her to stop acting out and that if she keeps this up then we won't get anymore help from mom. She argued that she was trying to feed our son and that it was awful of me to think of it as acting out. I said I understood her frustration and yes mom can do things that require some patience from us. but a little kindness can go a long way in keeping the peace in this difficult time. She called me selfish and said that it's easy for me to say when I'm not the one dealing with this. from there the argument escalated despite me trying to cut it short. I went outside to calm down and after that my wife started cold shouldering me. I told her this was not okay but she told me to go sc*ew myself and that from now on out I should deal with taking our son back from my mom when it's time for feeding since I condone this behabior. I really am not condoning anything and really think she's stressed out yes but the way she behaves around mom is, in my opinion, not okay. ETM:: My goodness! I'm seeing so much anger here. I'm sorry I can not respond to you all but I just want people to calm down and understand that I in no way  agree with some of my mom's behaviors, just how my wife reacts is......not okay and that's all. really. thank you very much though!

        "selftext": "So right now both of my kids (16 year old son and 9 year old daughter) and my ex are extremely mad at me because I won't give up my appointed time with them. My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time.   A little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't switch days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged.   Well, last week my ex contacted me and told me the good news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to think of them. I told him tough luck and hung up on him.  Well, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying ask them in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was not letting daddy take them to Disneyland. Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.  I'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being can't tell them the truth cause they already know it.   I'm so pissed right now. Am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during MY time with MY kids? How is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? ",

We are a healthful household and we teach moderation and controlling how much we take when we have treats. We are also very active and every day strive to get the boys moving. However, Gwen is only here two weekends a month, and her mother has the exact opposite attitude. In all honesty that woman's blood type is probably ketchup. Similarly, Gwen is about 20lb heavier than a 5 year old girl is supposed to be. It makes me sad for this child and her health so when we get her I try to teach Gwen about healthy eating and moving around. We have the boys play with her so she's getting active, and we make a distinction between foods that are healthy and ones that aren't. When I see one of the kids reaching for a treat food in the pantry I'll ask would you like to make a healthier choice? And Gwen is really getting it, she's always going for better choices now and is also asking for fruit at home which is really good. Gwen's birthday ended up falling on one of her weekends with us, and while we were talking about what kind of cake to have, I asked Gwen about the healthier choice. My reasoning is unfortunately she's still getting all that garbage at home, and it's just not good for a growing girl. She agreed and we decided to have some low fat ice cream so she can still have a sweet treat. It's a brand Gwen loves and asks for every time she's here, so she was happy with it. Until the next day after she went back to mom. Her mom called us furious, she said then when Gwen got home and she asked about her birthday with us and her cake, Gwen started crying because she really did want cake but didn't want to make a bad choice. She accused me of fat shaming her and her daughter and that I owe her a cake and a big apology. I'm just looking out for the health of a child in my care, but I never said Gwen couldn't have cake and she could have had one if she said she wanted one. I suggested sticking to ice cream because I care. But did I go about it in a TA way?",

        "selftext": "I (21f) usually always sit with the same group of people in my university\u2019s dining area. There\u2019s this girl who i\u2019ve talked to a few times, but i\u2019m not really friends with. She\u2019s kind of quiet, but when she finally talks she seems normal. I\u2019ve sat across from her a few times and noticed how she was eating because it was weird to me. She eats maybe half of her food (keep in mind you control the amount of food. it\u2019s cooked by the cafeteria staff buffet-style. she could easily take less) and kind of plays with it with her fork when she\u2019s \u201cdone\u201d (aka eating half of it, sometimes even less).  I didn\u2019t say anything for a while, but a few weeks ago I had to ask her why she always only ate half her food. She seemed a  embarrassed, but answered she thought she was more hungry and laughed it off. I then asked her why she made this mistake every time we ate, and that she must have learned by now. She didn\u2019t really answer (I don\u2019t actually remember, but it wasn\u2019t actually an explanation) and left pretty quickly. She doesn\u2019t really show up that much anymore, but when she does she still eats like this, and I couldn\u2019t hold it in anymore. I asked her once again, and also asked her if her parents never told her not to play with her food.  It was a genuine question, some people are raised in households where manners aren\u2019t important, but obviously they are for most people. She got really mad at me and told me to stop commenting on her eating habits and that it was none of my business. I told her that it absolutely was since she was sitting at our table and obviously wasting food. She told me to go fuck myself and left and threw out the rest of her food (AGAIN!) After she left, one of my friends told me to leave her alone as she seemed like she was having a hard time and maybe had some sort of issue with food. Yeah, obviously she has an issue with food?? She keeps wasting it! She hasn\u2019t shown up again, i\u2019m assuming she buys her own food now, which might teach her not to waste it so that\u2019s good. The same friend who told me to leave her alone keeps pestering me to apologise to her, but I think she should apologise to me. She\u2019s unnecessarily rude when being asked the most basic and obvious questions and also told me to go fuck myself? That\u2019s way more harsh than anything i\u2019ve ever told her. Keep in mind that I care a lot about food waste and the environment.AITA for telling a girl to stop wasting food? EDIT: OK! I\u2019m the asshole! Sorry i\u2019m not studying to be an eating disorder specialist. I looked up stuff about it and i\u2019m realising I was too harsh. I\u2019ll apologise the next time I see her and try not to be so condescending. But you should all follow your own advice. If people genuinely don\u2019t know something you should tell them nicely instead, and i realise i should\u2019ve tried to educate her NICELY about food waste and not have commented at all on how she was eating",

        "selftext": "I F30 have been with my fiance Ned M36 for a year and a half. He has a 5yo son with his ex girlfriend. They don't have a custody arrangement but he has him most of the week because the mom is currently sick. His son is lovely but I noticed that Ned takes him everywhere he goes, including places that aren't child friendly and we have an issue with that now but we're working on it.  His son's 5th birthday was days ago, Ned took us out to a restaurant to celebrate. The place was nice and looked a bit unfitting for the occasion because it was a somewhat expensive place. Anyways, We ordered food then got the birthday cake which was a surprise to me because I thought we were going to celebrate at home...so we could be free to sing and play however we wanted. I still had no issue with that til Ned started singing the happy birthday song to his son. I was stunned I almost drop my plate. He was singing it at the top of his lungs not even looking around or paying attention to how many people staring at us awkwardly. I felt so embarrassed I kept whispering for him to stop but he ignored me. Of course my future stepson was hyped and a little too active which isn't good when we're at a public place. I expected the staff, the manager, anyone to get involved and stop him but no one did. In fact some woman came up to us and offered that she help him take a video recording. I wasn't in it at all. I froze in my seat looking stunned and a little angry. He looked at me later asking what was wrong. I didn't say anything except thanks for finally noticing! he didn't understand what I meant and I didn't explain til we were in the car. I flatout told him that he embarrassed me the second he started singing in the restaurant. He looked shocked saying he didn't get why I would be embarrassed by him celebrating his son's birthday and cheering him up. I told him we could've done this at home when we'd be more comfortable and free. He took it as in I was ashamed of him and his son but I denied it and said that it just felt awkward and embarrassing to maybe because I've never been in this situation and also judging from the restaurant we were at. He said that his son's mom is sick and he's trying to do all he can to cheer him up and that all families do that and no one had an issue with that except me then when I tried to explain, he got mad and said he no longer felt like talking. We haven't been speaking since then. It appears he's still salty about me saying what I said and insiating that I see him and his son as an embarrassement. AITA? I think he's being too harsh with the whole ignoring me thing instead of talking it out.",

        "selftext": "I (35F) am a single mother to 2 kids (5 & 3).  Both my kids are in daycare and over the years I have built a solid friend group with a handful of other moms and our kids regularly get together for play dates.  The father of my kids is not in the picture at all and my relationship with him is non-existent.  This is 100% for the best and I am currently in therapy to deal with a lot of things that my ex did to me.  This friend group has literally been a lifesaver for me at times.   A few months ago, there were 2 new kids that started at our daycare center.  They are similar in age to my kids and were placed in the same classes as them.  I noticed that their dad was the only parent to ever pick up or drop off the kids.  He would try to make small talk with me a few times, but I am uncomfortable around strange men so I would be polite, but not engage further than that.   Our mom group has a group chat that we use to support each other and arrange play dates.  A few weeks ago, one of the moms texted the group chat that she was adding this new dad to our group chat because he wanted to have his kids participate in play dates outside of daycare.   I privately texted that other mom and told her that I don't feel comfortable with a man I don't know having my contact information and told her that she should have consulted all of us before deciding on her own to add him to our group chat.  I then texted the rest of the moms and told them that I want them to keep a separate group chat without the other dad because I don't know him and it makes me uncomfortable.   This resulted in a lot of divided opinions with about half of the moms agreeing to a separate chat and the other half saying that would be too difficult to keep track of and that it is wrong to exclude another parent just because he's a man and that I'm being unreasonable.   The mom I texted privately replied to me that she has talked with this dad numerous times and that he seems like a nice person and good parent and that his kids shouldn't be excluded if they want to hang out with their friends outside of daycare.  She told me I am being difficult and making this all harder than it needs to be.   The other day when I picked up my kids, my 5-year-old was upset because a bunch of his friends were talking about a playdate that he wasn't invited to.  I texted the moms about it and they said that they were getting the kids together with the new dad and didn't invite my kids because of how I was acting.    I told them it was rude to exclude my kids like that and a couple of the moms told me to grow up because that's exactly what I was trying to do to this dad and his kids.   I'm at a loss because these moms have been so supportive to me in the past and as soon as this dad comes into the picture it's like they pulled a 180 and don't seem to care at all.  There are still other moms who agree with me, but now it's like our friend group has been divided by this.  ",

        "selftext": "My ex and I are split up.  Our older son lives with him and younger with me.  We are both not high income but he somehow landed a wife who makes 4x our income and they often go out of the country on nice vacations which I guess he has been sharing with the kids. The kids want their passports now thanks to his brainwashing. I initially said yes because him and my son caught me off guard and started asking me if it was okay one day.  Then I had time to think about it and realized how bad things are in the world right now and I don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s worth the risk and danger having the kids so far away from me and out of the country with their dad and stepmom.  They also need my consent per our custody agreement to go out of the country anyway, and at this point I\u2019d never say yes. So today when my ex asked me if X date was okay for the passport appointment I asked where he is even going to be taking the kids, to which he told me \u201che didn\u2019t know yet, they just want to get the ball rolling because it takes 3 months just to get the passport and they haven\u2019t planned anything specific yet\u201d which I find sketchy. So I told him and the kids no, that he needs my consent to take them anywhere because of how bad the world is right now and I\u2019d never agree so passports are pointless.  My younger son got upset and my ex got angry also and kept repeating \u201care you just never going to allow them to go anywhere then?\u201d I never said that, just not right now. So my ex is texting me now saying I\u2019m an asshole and I\u2019m \u201crobbing my kids of experiences\u201d except I never have gone out of the country and don\u2019t have a passport and I am fine, so I don\u2019t really buy it.  Like does a 7 year old and a 14 year old really need to experience japan or england or whatever, they can go when they are 18 and probably appreciate it more then. Other than some initial disappointment my kids haven\u2019t even mentioned it to me again so I have a feeling they don\u2019t really care and it\u2019s more their dad influencing them. So AITA?",

He refused to get them when he was a child/teen cause he feared people would make fun of him, but he finally accepted to get them after the dentists told him clearly that it wouldn't be recommended to replace his extracted teeth till he fixes his crooked ones. The issue is that our wedding was supposed to be coming up soon, but now I plan to postpone till my fiance gets rid f his braces. I have nothing against him wearing braces. I even encouraged him to get them to finally fix his bad teeth, but did you ever saw of a groom wearing braces at his wedding photos ? I don't think so. I thought my fiance would be understanding, but instead he got mad at me and accused me of being ashamed with him. That's obviously no true, I just want our wedding photos to be as esthetically pleasing as possible and that's why I want to postpone our wedding till his braces come off. I also told him he could've avoided all this if he got invisible braces, but he said these were much more expensive and wanted to save money specifically for our wedding and honey moon and didn't think his fiancee would be so shallow to care about it. He ended up saying that if I postpone the wedding now I might as well just call it off altogether, which I think is incredibly unfair of him to do, but maybe I should've insisted on this issue either.

        "selftext": " 2 weeks ago my son [Ethan, 27]and his wife [Jess, 30] bought a small one story house in the town we live in. After settling down they invited us for a small party for the occasion. We sat for dinner and talked about the house a bit. Me, my husband and Jess continued conversing after Ethan excused himself to take an important call. Jess showed me the original key to the house and I asked if she made copies yet and she said no. I said she should and also give one copy to me as well. She looked at me funny and asked why she should. I explained that it is necessary so that it could be used in emergencies. she rudely said I don't know what kind of an emergency that would require you having a key to our house, sure won't be a fire incident!. She obviously didn't seem to have any idea that a fire incident wasn't what I meant and I got offended by her sarcasm. I pointed out that it's not just her decision because this is my son's house as well. She smiled at me trying to be polite and stated that only the ones who contributed towards the house get a copy and that I really don't need one anyway. Also assured me that my son will have the same answer for me. Basically saying Don't bother bring this up with Ethan, he'll tell you the same thing but I did and she spoke on his behalf the entire argument repeating what she said over and over. Things escalated to her calling me pushy and me telling her she was being unnecessarily rude and disrespectful . My husband and I left in a rush and I felt horrible. My husband went on and on about how paranoid and controlling I was to basically be demanding a copy of the key to the new house but again I stated that I was just trying to be helpful and taking extra precautions since anything could happen but he insisted I overstepped and ruined Ethan's and Jess's joy for their new house as well as dinner. I genuienly do not think what I said was out of line and I'm not sure why Jess reacted so intensely. I think my request was innocent.",

My wife (F33) is a big nerd, which I normally appreciate, but she is taking things way too far today. She took today off of work, so she could be up at 4AM to play her online game at launch. I didn\u2019t wake up until about an hour ago (10:30, and she was still playing. I mentioned that I wasHungry, hoping we could make breakfast together , which we like to do together. She instead said that I should \u201corder us something from doordash, im in the middle of a dungeon and may be a while.\u201d I didn\u2019t really wanna get takeout, because we had already discussed ordering pizza tonight for dinner, and that\u2019s a lot of take out food in one day.

I said that it was unfair to our family for her to isolate all weekend, and she got even more mad, telling me that I have two hands and can feed the goddamn cat. I was in tears at this point, and I did raise my voice and said that I was worried she\u2019s obsessed with this game and maybe she needs professional help. She threw her car keys at me and said that I need to get out of her face, that she\u2019s works all the time and doesn\u2019t ask for much, and I need to leave her be and get out of her face for a few hours. I am truly concerned that she has become obsessed with this online game, and I\u2019m hoping that maybe reading this thread will wake her up to it, but I might\u2019ve been the AH too. Edit: some additional info I forgot: ir isn\u2019t just today, for the last few weeks she\u2019s been hyping herself up for this. When the game got delayed, she MOVED HER VACATION time rather than just keep her previous day off and spend it with me.

        "selftext": "Hi everybody (((: I (20F) and my fianc\u00e9 (24M) will get married next year in the summer and I'm very much looking forward to this. We have our issues, but then again, which couple doesn't, right? However, lately, he has been ridiculing my studies and the degree I'm getting. I'm studying in the Netherlands and he lives in Denmark, so we will close the distance next year after the wedding. I'm currently in my last year of the bachelor's degree in biomedical sciences. I would argue (but of course I'm biased) that this is a very intensive study and requires a lot of time and effort. Sometimes when I complain about this, he says that my degree doesn't matter and that I would be better off quitting anyway. The reason why he says this is because we would like to have a marriage with more traditional gender roles once we are married. So he will earn the money and I will become a SAHM. I don't have a problem with this, but I would like to have a degree to fall back on during tough times. Whenever I try to make this argument, he shuts it down immediately and claims that I would be better off just quitting my studies and becoming a housewife already, since once we are married I will never use my degree anyway. I would not mind working e.g. two times a week, but he is strongly opposed to this as he claims that it would interfere with my tasks and chores in our marriage.  He is currently still in carpentry school, which consists of him having several months of work followed by weeks of school, both of which he gets paid for. Not only does he dismiss the difficulty of my degree, but he also claims that the work he is doing is much harder. I can't disagree with him, because physically speaking it is definitely much more intensive, but I would like for him to acknowledge that my degree is also time-consuming and difficult.  Recently he made a joke about what a waste of time it was, me getting my degree when I should be in DK and making him dinner instead, since that would be more fulfilling for both him and me. I know I should not let these harmless jokes get under my skin, but I lashed out at him and told him he needed to stop ridiculing my academic achievements and dismissing all of it so easily, since it might come in handy at some point in the future. He then quite seriously told me (again) that I shouldn't take everything so personally and that he was speaking the truth, since I will not use my degree once we are married so it is a waste of time and money. Then somehow he spun it around and told me that I was not appreciative enough of him wanting to provide for me and our future family and that if I wanted to be a 'girlboss' I would be free to do so on my own.  So now I'm wondering if I did make a mistake by telling him to stop ridiculing my degree and if I somehow hurt him by appearing ungrateful. So, AITA?",

His best friend who was a mutual friend of ours until the divorce also texted me and said that he hoped I was happy with myself. I don\u2019t get how I could be an asshole but it obviously seems like he and his best friend has come to that conclusion, if I am the asshole yes I will apologize but firstly I need to know. Edit!My kids are fine and I of course would have taken them if no one else was available, I am not a monster. They are currently with his best friend as my ex is still in the hospital with his wife. So no, I would not him \u201crather\u201d leaving them with a stranger as many of you assume.",

We\u2019ve been saying we\u2019ll convert the laundry room into a bathroom for the twins for a while. It\u2019s an expensive project so we\u2019ve never gotten to it.  My husband and I started working on our garage recently and turned it into a gym for him, a new laundry room, and an office for me. Then we came into some money and decided to renovate both bathrooms, remodel the kitchen, and do work on the backyard.  The girls were pissed when we told them about the work we were doing on the house. They were saying it\u2019s not fair that my husband gets a gym when the twins share a room and that we chose to work on the backyard instead of adding the third bathroom.  They\u2019ve been calling us selfish and even got our parents and siblings to give us a hard time for not giving the girls another bathroom or giving the twins their own rooms. They don\u2019t understand that now that the laundry room is done we have the space for the bathroom. The bathroom is next on our list.  I wanted to get some outside opinions on this since our kids and our families have been giving us a hard time.",

We spent the day in an area that\u2019s known to have a lot of rich/famous people and towards the end of the day we saw one of my daughter\u2019s favorite celebrities (we\u2019ll call her A) walking out of a store.  My daughter ran to the store but when she got near A, she was stopped by A\u2019s security. They said that A\u2019s there with her daughter for her daughter\u2019s birthday and wants to focus on her daughter.  My daughter was very upset because she\u2019s been a fan of A for a very long time so she tried again for a picture but was turned away.  My daughter was crushed so later that night I made a post talking about my experience with A. How she wouldn\u2019t let anyone go near her and her daughter, the fact that her security was rude, and her not being willing to stop for a couple seconds for a picture. I understand it\u2019s her daughter\u2019s birthday but a 1 minute interaction with a fan isn\u2019t going to ruin her day and if it does, that girl needs to learn that the world doesn\u2019t revolve around her.  The post ended up getting a lot of attention and a lot of people actually said my daughter and I were being entitled for expecting A to interrupt her daughter\u2019s birthday for everyone that wants a picture.  My husband also saw the post and said he couldn\u2019t believe that I would bash her for trying to spend the day with her daughter. I\u2019m not trying to bash her for spending the day with her daughter but she wouldn\u2019t be where she is without her fans so I think she at least owes it to them to take a picture.

I am on the more fit side, I\u2019m pretty lean, have well defined muscles and probably around 15% body fat. I used to be about 40 pounds heavier and lost the weight pretty simply. My girlfriend always complains about her weight and her body. I tell her I find her sexy for so many reasons outside her body and it didn\u2019t matter to me whether she got bigger or smaller. Eventually she decided she wanted to lose weight, I offered to help and when I pointed out things she could be doing better she gets mad at me. She isn\u2019t losing weight currently and in fact says she is gaining a few extra pounds. I ask her what exactly she eats in a day, she says she eats healthy so she should lose weight. I question that and we have an argument. I tell her that if she wants to show me, let me just spend a day with her and see what she eats in a day. She said only if I don\u2019t make comments on what she\u2019s eating as she\u2019s eating it. I agreed. Now by the end of the day she had consumed, a plate of avocado toast that was about 400 calories, a coffee that was 110 calories, an 800 calorie salad from chick fil a and a fry (as a \u201creward\u201d for the salad) and veggie burrito that was about 500 calories. Along with snakinga but throughout the day. Her total consumption was about 2200 calories. At the end of the day I explained this to her. My exact words were that the amount of calories she is consuming is the amount I need to maintain my weight as a man 5 inches and 20 pounds bigger, who is constantly active. So chances are she\u2019ll slowly gain weight eating like that and that eating healthy isn\u2019t going to guarantee she\u2019ll lose weight. She got super fucking pissed at me and told me I wasn\u2019t helping her and was just shaming her. I told her I want to help her but she did not listen.  AITA ",

When I was a kid I always wanted a dog but my parents said no. I never got the chance to get one during my twenties but recently my interest in owning one was sparked again so I asked my family what they thought about getting a dog. My wife wasn\u2019t enthusiastic about it but she relented after a few weeks of me asking. Alex and Jake were excited to get one but Dylan was immediately opposed to the idea.  Dylan was always different than my other sons, he never had an interest in sports and was always more subdued than his brothers which has always made it hard for me to connect with him.  He remained opposed to the idea of getting a dog but me and my other sons managed to wear him down until he finally relented. However, he said that if we did get a dog, he wasn\u2019t going to be interacting with it or taking care of it, that would be completely on me and his brothers. I found this ridiculous but i agreed in the moment hoping he would change his mind after meeting the dog.  The problem is he hasn\u2019t changed his mind yet. We\u2019ve had Zeus for seven months now and Dylan has not warmed up to him in the slightest.  He doesn\u2019t play with the dog, he doesn\u2019t cuddle with him, he doesn\u2019t let Zeus into his room because he \u201cdestroys stuff\u201d and whenever he is near the dog he just ignores him. I find this completely ridiculous. Zeus loves Dylan, he follows him around whenever he sees him and jumps on him to get his attention and play but Dylan just isn\u2019t receptive to it. To change this, I told Dylan last week that he would be in charge of walking the dog every day after school. Dylan straight up refused and has shut down the conversation every time I bring it up. It\u2019s been a week and he hasn\u2019t walked the dog once.  In my frustration, I told him that if he didn\u2019t start listening then I wouldn\u2019t allow him to go to the comic book store anymore and he freaked and told my wife. Now, my wife is upset with me, claiming that I knew what I was getting into with this and I knew that Dylan wouldn\u2019t be playing with the dog but his intolerance of the dog is weird and I refuse to entertain it any longer.  My wife has been short with me ever since that conversation and Dylan is cold with me as well. Alex is now agreeing with his mother which is making me have second thoughts. So Reddit, AITA?",

On the car ride back, Will was pretty quiet. I ask if he\u2019s fine and all he says in a sarcastic tone is, \u201cPeachy.\u201d I ask him if I did anything to upset him and he responds back with, \u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m educated enough to properly explain myself.\u201d I tell him I didn\u2019t tell my friends that he was unintelligent, just that he wasn\u2019t college educated. He accused me of minimizing how hard his Navy schooling was, but I explained that military education and college education are simply not the same. We continued to fight until we got home.

Even my parents started calling and there was a huge fuss which frankly, was unnecessary if my brother just left in silence or made up some excuse. I contacted him later and expressed my grief and frustration with what he did. I told him how the news of his wife being in labor disrupted the wedding and caused my wife to feel like her day was ruined. He lashed out asking how any of that was his fault. I explained how he should've just left or made up some excuse to leave but he said he didn't mean any harm and that he was in a hurry and worried at the time. He said it wasn't like he announced it and told me I disrespected him by arguing with him about it. We had a big argument and our parents sided with him and told me to 'get over myself' and are now expecting me to apologize. Edit// I just came back and started reading the comments.

The past few months, my house has turned into a hangout spot among my friends. My best friend Tyler is dating Gwen. Gwen has a friend named Julie. We\u2019ve all known each other since freshman year of college. I\u2019ve always had a crush on Julie and we\u2019ve always been part of the same group. One night a few weeks ago I decided to just go for it and texted her to ask her out. She told me that she liked me as a friend. I told her I totally understood and thought that would be the end of it.  Well the next pool day came. I typically send out giant group text to invite everyone. I decided to not invite Julie this time. But she showed up. Not even with Tyler or Jenn. She came with some of the other friends in our group. And it was just really awkward. She tried talking to me the WHOLE time. I\u2019d say something quickly and try to leave. She partnered with me for every drinking game. We have never spoken that much even before I asked her out. After she left that night I told Tyler/Gwen what happened. Gwen told me she already knew. I told them that I didn\u2019t really want her around anymore. Gwen said she would talk to Julie about it. Well this past Saturday I had another pool day. Similar thing, sent out the text, left Julie off of it. I invited a girl that I\u2019ve been talking to. Well Julie shows up again. But this time she spends the whole day talking to the new girl I brought. They became \u201cbesties\u201d. Julie even told the girl that I asked her out before. It was just incredibly awkward for me.  So this Sunday I texted Julie individually and told her that I didn\u2019t want her around anymore. And that she shouldn\u2019t come to the next get together as I felt uncomfortable. She didn\u2019t respond. But now people in the friend group are calling me an AH.

And what I really appreciate about this counselor is that she takes our situation into account as well and is willing to speak up for my husband and I. A few years ago, when our daughter wanted us to attend a gay parade with her, we were hesitant and our counselor stood by us by telling our daughter that it was too soon. But other than the gay parade, things have been pretty smooth up until now. My husband has drawn a hard line about attending the wedding. I was sort of on the fence about attending, but I decided to stick with my husband. Our daughter is pissed. At our last therapy session together, a week ago, our daughter said that if we didnt come to the wedding, all the work and progress that we had made would mean nothing to her, and that she would not want us to be a part of her life. Again the counselor spoke up for us and told our daughter that everyone had their hard boundaries (boundaries that they would absolutely not cross) and that instead of making ultimatums, it would be better to consider the overall picture rather than letting one moment be the deciding factor of the relationship. [I'm paraphrasing, she said it much better, but I think I got the main point]. The counselor talked to me privately afterward and told me how her parents hadn't came to her wedding, and they eventually made up thirty years down the line, but that was thirty years of memories that they both had missed out on. Yet, when she talked to her parents about it recently, they said that even as much as it had hurt them not to go, they would have made the same choice because it was just something that they strongly disapproved of. She ended by telling me that she wasn't going to tell me to go or not to go, but to really consider all the pros and cons.",

        "selftext": "I had a major fight with my wife a few hours ago and I strongly think I\u2019m in the right but she is so angry I almost feel like I\u2019m the one crazy. I\u2019ll provide context. I married my wife 3 years ago but we have been together 6. One important thing to note is she\u2019s extremely clean. I regret not moving in together until we married because while I knew she was clean I didn\u2019t know the full extent. Let this be a lesson to live with your partner before marriage. She is the reason why our house looks like a model home. She hates dishes in the sink while I\u2019m content to let them sit for a couple days. She spends her off days scrubbing bathrooms because in her mind they should be cleaned weekly. She doesn\u2019t let me bring my shoes inside and insists I shower immediately when I get home before laying in bed. There are a million more things but hopefully you have an idea.  This didn\u2019t start hurting our marriage until we had kids. We have a 2 year old and a 1 year old. I\u2019m a SAHD. I left work when our youngest was born and that is when our disagreement on how clean the home needs to be started to get bad. She expects me to do most of the chores now when it used to be primarily her and I wouldn\u2019t mind if they were reasonable. She wants the children to have a bath everyday and I think every 1-3 days is fine. She wants all of their toys put away by the end of the day and I think there is no point when it will be a mess again. She wants the dishes done daily. She wants all house bedding washed weekly. She wants me to vacuum weekly. She wants me to mop every 3-4 days since in her logic the kids spend a lot of time playing on the floor. They will not be hurt or sick if I mop every 2 weeks. Because I don\u2019t play along with most of her demands she ends up being the one to do most of the housework when she gets home or her rare off days. She works 40-80 hours/week so it is a lot but she does it to herself. I feel I do what is reasonable. This all built up to today. She got home and saw I hadn\u2019t yet washed the dishes and there was still grease/food in some of the pans and on the countertop. Also I hadn\u2019t yet brought in the trash cans from the previous two days when they were emptied. She flew off the handle calling me lazy and a slob. She said she would like for me to return to work since in her eyes I\u2019m doing a poor job and use the money to hire a weekly housekeeper and a nanny who \u201cwouldn\u2019t leave the kids in pjs all day.\u201d I got pissed and told her she is crazy and she works herself up over small things and I will not be leaving my kids with a stranger. She packed a bag for herself and our babies and to her mom\u2019s house. I\u2019m furious. Am I the asshole? Edit: so I\u2019m the asshole. The common belief is I need to help more around the house. I\u2019ll see what I can do and apologize to my wife. Thanks.",

        "selftext": "I (30f) am a teacher. I have a class with 24 students. I teach 1st grade.  I told my students that we could have a barbecue at a park (with hotdogs and hamburgers and snacks) for whoever filled their \u201cgood noodle\u201d sticker charts. This has been approved by the principal and I teach at a private school.  We have daily sticker charts to track their behavior in school. They had to have perfect behavior all of April in order to participate.  I have one student who has some behavioral issues. They did not earn all of their good noodle stickers this month. Since this student - we\u2019ll call Bobby - didn\u2019t earn the barbecue I had let his mother know just in case he mentioned it.  Bobby would join another class for the day and do work inside while his classmates were at the barbecue.  She has been sending emails complaining to myself and the principal all week about how her child should also be able to participate and it is unfair. She thinks we should make an exception since he has behavioral issues and feels we could be targeting him. I think I\u2019m being fair because he did not earn all of his good noodle stickers.  So AITA? Update:  I had a meeting today after school with the parents and the principal.  The principal agrees it would not be fair to the other students to allow Bobby to participate. She expressed she understands the frustration but she needs to make it fair for all students and not just Bobby.  The father said he understood and thought it was a fair assessment if all the other students were able to complete the goal.  The mother argued Bobby\u2019s IEP. The principal then reminded her we follow his IEP as a courtesy but as a private school we legally do not have to follow it and she has a choice to come to this school but if she\u2019d like to unenroll Bobby then there was a waiting list of students they could contact to take his place.  Bobby will still be enrolled in the school and in my class if anyone is wondering. He will not be attending the barbecue. Update 2:  Bobby\u2019s mother came to the school yesterday to drop off Bobby\u2019s lunch he forgot at home. She arrived during the children\u2019s snack recess. All of the kids were playing freeze tag. A game where once you\u2019re tagged you have to freeze until someone unfreezes you. I was inside prepping art while the teachers aid was with them.  Bobby\u2019s mother came inside absolutely livid saying we were forcing her child to stand in one place and not let him move. We explained the game and she said then the students are cruel for not unfreezing him but unfreezing everyone else. She was making such a big scene and so loud the principal overheard (their office is down the hall).   His mother was removed from the school grounds and we had a meeting with his father in the afternoon. The principal let him know Bobby would need to be unenrolled due to his mothers behavior. He did try to get him to stay until at least the end of the year but ultimately understood. He was also told if Bobby\u2019s mother is on the school grounds again the police department will be called immediately.",

        "selftext": " I used to have a german shepard named Willy, but had to put him up for adoption because my future stepson is allergic to dogs so Willy had to be out of the house before my fiancee and her son moved in with me. Ngl, I did feel like I'd given up on Willy, I've had him since he was small but I did thorough digging to find him the perfect home and the perfect family. I'd met up with the family and they embraced him right away, they seemed nice and all and agreed to keep in contact so I could learn about how willy's doing. This took place in december, I got busy with the holidays then loads and loads of work and was only able to call the family to check on Willy last week. Anyways so while I was with them on the phone I heard a small girl yelling Rudy repeatedly, I asked who Rudy was and they casually said it was Willy but they gave him a new name. I was absolutely shocked I asked if they were being serious with me and they asked what's wrong. I absolutely lost it on them telling them that that dog already has a name that was given to him by his owner and they should respect that. Pluse all his legal papers are under the name Willy but I was surprised when they said they took care of that legally...like how... I told them they had no permission from to rename the dog point blank period. but they argued that willy is theirs now and I have no say, I told them they were dead wrong and demanded that they have some respect and stop confusing him and start calling him with his real name. They refused and we got into a huge fight on the phone and social media where they threatened to block me. I was so mad I took the argument to their place where they threatened to report me for harrasement. I decided to take few days to let things settle down then I'd visit them again but my fiancee thinks I'm overstepping and should let the family decide this stuff without harrassing them which was an expected thing to hear from her since my stepson is the reason I had to let of my dog in the first place. She got offended but I told her that siding with strangers mistreating my dog did not paint her in good light though I started thinking she might be right. So AITA?",

        "selftext": "This is literally really stupid but she's really upset about it. So my (48) daughter (23) has a blue tongue skink who she heavily adores. She jokingly refers to it as her daughter, I've found it weird but she says it's because it's the closest thing she'd have to a child and she feels a strong emotional bond similar to a child. She has decided to remain child free for multiple reasons and I have been very supportive of this decision. Well she recently took her Skink to the vet for a checkup and she was excited to find out her Skinks gender. Afterwards I got a text asking if I'd come to her gender reveal party she was having. She explained it was just a small get together with cake and food for her friends she hasn't seen in a while with the gender reveal being mostly a joke (and a way to make fun of real gender reveals). Well I didn't come. I didn't see a point. It's just a lizard and I'm a busy person. She later called me and expressed she was kind of sad I didn't come cuz it'd been a while since I'd seen her but she understood I was busy. I told her she couldn't actually expect me to come to a gender reveal for a lizard. She said that it wasn't a real gender reveal, that was more of a joke and it was really just a small gathering to catch up with everyone. I told her if that was the case she should've just called it a gathering because I'm not coming to a gender reveal unless it's for a real grand daughter. She got quiet for a minute and then turned my words around, claiming I wasn't supportive of her decision to be childfree. I told her she can't possibly expect me to treat a lizard as a grand daughter, she said she didn't expect me too but it was clear I didn't respect her bond with her lizard and her decision, and she just wanted to see me and my reason for coming was hurtful. I told her she was being ridiculous over a lizard, she claimed it wasn't over the lizard and it was a gathering and not even centered around the lizard, but I stick by to what I said. It's ridiculous to have a gender reveal for a lizard. She hung up and I got a message from her best friend about how I'm an asshole for treating her that way, but I don't think I'm the asshole for not wanting to go to a party for a lizard?   EDIT: In the time I was away I got many replies and it was a lot to read through. Let me clear a couple things up. 1. My issue is that she said the party was a gender reveal, if she had called it just a party I would have come. But calling it a gender reveal makes it sound like it's for the lizard, and I'm not going to that even if it is a joke. 2. I don't know why it matters but the Skink is a girl which is why I said I'm not coming to a gender reveal unless it's for a real grand daughter. 3. Even though I don't agree with my daughter for being childfree, I have been supportive and only shown mild frustration. The reasons she decided to be childfree is she claims she's asexual, she just doesn't want one, she has emotional baggage and feels unable to care for a real child, she fears pregnancy, and she has a carrier gene like me and doesn't want to go through what I did (I had 4 miscarriages and a highly defect child that died after 3 months due to the gene). Yes there has been slight tension between us because I think she just hasn't found the right man (she never dated growing up) and her other fears are unnecessarily exaggerated, but it's ultimately her decision and I don't resent her.4. We haven't seen each other in three months. I'm a single mother and we have always been close which is why she invited me with her friends, I just didn't want to go to a party with a lizard, and if it wasn't for the lizard she should've called it a party instead of a gender reveal.",

        "selftext": "I've been married to my 2nd Husband Mike for 4 years now. He's a jokester and loves to crack jokes all the time. He especially like to joke with my brother Ethan and his wife. Ethan used to be okay with it til he started complaining about Mike taking it too far with his jokes. Some context about Ethan. He and his wife couldn't have kids so they adopted a boy Joey 2 years ago. Mike has been making silly, lighthearted jokes that involving Joey's bio parents as a way to mess with Ethan and his wife. I already talked to Mike and I tell you that he's 100%means no harm and he was just trying to get them to react. So fast forward to NYE, my parents hosted a big celebratory dinner and Ethan and his wife came. While we were eating dinner, Mike decided to tell a knock-knock joke to Ethan. He said Knock knock.. Ethan laughed and said Who's there?. Mike replied Joey's bio parents then he bursted out laughing. Silence took over and Ethan's facial experssions changed. His wife called Mike an idiot to which Mike replied with Hey...Relax it was just a joke. An argument ensued and dinner was paused. My parents suddenly told Mik to leave which I thought was too harsh. I tried to speak to them and get them to calm down but mom insisted that Mike leave. We left and Mike was complaining the whole time about how they overreacted. I called mom later and she told me Mike was out of line with his hurtful jokes about this touchy topic and told me I was wrong for defending him and saying he was just joking. She said he ruined NY for the family but I told her it was her and dad who ruined NY celebration for escalating the situation and kicking him out. I told her he could talk to them but again they were the ones who ruined NY celebration. She called me delusional for this statement and hung up. We haven't talked to them for days. I tried contacting Ethan but no response.",

        "selftext": "I\u2019m 49m and I have 2 children, Jake (23) and Nikki (17). Their mother and I are divorced. I have full custody and she sends no support. Both of my kids are good kids and good students with good grades. Jake got into his dream school but didn\u2019t get any scholarships. His undergrad school is one of the best school in our part of the country and it\u2019s expensive. I didn\u2019t want him to take out loans and have to carry a debt so I\u2019m paying for his tuition and living expenses. The total cost is roughly $50,000 a year. He\u2019s following in our family tradition and pursuing a career in dentistry (I\u2019m not a dentist but we have about a dozen dentists and oral surgeons in our family). I will also be paying for his dentistry degree. While I know it will be costly, I view this as a good investment as he\u2019ll have a starting salary of about $120,000 as a dentist in our area. If he decides to become an oral surgeon, his starting salary will almost double that figure. Nikki is a senior in HS. Like her brother, she\u2019s a good student and will have a good chance of getting into her dream school but she has a low chance of getting any scholarships. Her dream school is also a very good one located in the middle of a very expensive city. Tuition and living expenses will be roughly $75,000 a year. The problem is that she\u2019s dreamt of being a teacher since she was little and have made it clear she will be an education major because she wants to be a middle school teacher. The other problem is that the salary for middle school teachers in our area is $48,000-$60,000 in our area. I fully realize that she can move and work elsewhere but I can\u2019t imagine there are many middle school teacher in the US making 6 figures. I don\u2019t view paying $300,000+ for a career that tops out at $60,000 as a wise investment. I told my daughter that the state school that\u2019s 2 hours away have a good education program and her instate tuition and living expenses will only be about $20,000 a year. I view paying $80,000 for a teaching degree as a much better investment.  I\u2019ve tried discussing the matter with Nikki but she gets distraught every time I\u2019ve brought it up. She cries and accuses me of favoring Jake and being a sexist which is not true. I told her if she picks a major with a $100,000 starting salary, I\u2019ll gladly pay for her to go to her dream school but there\u2019s no way I\u2019m paying $300,000 for her to be a teacher. Now she\u2019s got family members involved. Some are staying out of it, some agree with me, and some are telling me not to play favorites.  I feel terrible so I\u2019m beginning to doubt myself. Am I wrong? Edit to answer a recurring question: I thought I made it clear but apparently I didn\u2019t. I\u2019m not limiting Nikki\u2019s education to $20,000 a year. I told her that\u2019s the max I\u2019m willing to pay for her education degree. I\u2019m more than happy to pay $75,000 a year if she picks another degree that will have a better return. For a while she thought about being a doctor and fell in love with England (we have family there) so I even offered to pay for her to go to Oxford which will be double the cost of her brother\u2019s tuition. But she\u2019s adamant about being a middle school teacher and I\u2019m unwilling to spend $300,000 that I worked hard for on an education degree. Edit to add: Oxford is hard to get into, I know that she won\u2019t be able to just walk in. I meant for her to apply and if she got in, I\u2019m willing to pay the cost of that school and the expense of living in an expensive country if her degree earning potential warrants that cost. Edit to answer a recurring question #2: Why did I bring up the family tradition? Am I an elitist? Why does it matter? I brought it up because getting into dental schools and graduating is tough. The reason why we have so many in our family is because we help each other out. The dentists and oral surgeons in the family happily tutor and give valuable internship experiences that would otherwise not be available. People who pursued the dental career in our family have never failed because we don\u2019t allow them to fail. Last semester my brother spent weeks tutoring our niece to prepare her for her state board exam and she passed in one try.",

He\u2019s at a curious age and is discovering the world, and I refuse to try and limit him and shut him down for not having the emotional sensitivity of an adult. Politely, I told that mother that I was sorry her daughter was struggling with insecurities, and I found some online parenting articles about building your child\u2019s confidence to send to her so she could use some tips to help her daughter out. She replied and said I was acting completely shamelessly and disgracefully, and I am not able to text her anymore. AITA?",

        "selftext": "My (16, M) family has a pet parrot. They are all pretty much obsessed with him and my younger and older sisters both keep buying him toys, new food, making him new fruit and vegetable mixes to try out etc. My parents also pay a lot of attention to him and even set up the extra room we have for his cage so he can sleep better at night. He has been with us for a few months now and my family's obsession still hasn't died down. I've been mostly indifferent since I'm not the biggest fan of animals and my parents keep him away from my room. Luckily for me it seems like he doesn't like me anyways so it's even easier to avoid him flying to my shoulder or anything like that.  The problem though is that today my sister Emma (10,F) was talking quietly to that bird. She was holding him and saying things like You know I love you right? and kissing him on the head while the parrot would just mimic the sound. It went on for a while and she repeated that enough that it seemed like she was looking for a response so I told her You know he doesn't understand you right.  After I said that she just looked at me and made a sour face and ignored me. I didn't want her to actually believe this bird can understand what she is saying since she watches a lot of Disney movies so I feel like they could have given her the wrong idea. I gently explained to her that it's just a bird and that he doesn't understand things like we do. She told me to stop bothering her and ended up leaving the room and told my mom about it. My mom told me she believed it was harmless for my sister to talk to her pet and that the bird reciprocated her feelings. So I told her that this will harm my sister's way of thinking and get her bullied at school. She told me to drop it and not get involved anymore. AITA? I think my sister is old enough to understand what I'm saying and my mom is just too nice.",

I've got a fake grass lawn.\u00a0 A guy walking his dog stopped, let his dog shit in my yard.\u00a0 Baffled, I just say what the fuck?\u00a0 He goes, i'm cleaning it up.\u00a0 I clean it up every time my dog poops here.\u00a0 I tell him I don't care if you clean it up.\u00a0 My young kids play in the grass, like they are now, and i don't want them playing in dog shit.\u00a0\u00a0 He says he always picks up his turds and nothing is left behind.\u00a0 I'm like, there is still poop residue, and your dog peed.\u00a0 Are you spraying my yard down?\u00a0 He of course says no.\u00a0 I say don't ever let your dog do its business here again.\u00a0 He just stares at me.\u00a0 I continue, I don't have a dog, I don't want dog problems affecting my life.\u00a0 He says, you could have just asked nicely asshole and says some other mean things. I yell I hope I never see you again.\u00a0 My wife saw the whole thing and said I was a bit agressive, especially with the kdis around.\u00a0 AITA?  Edit: this blew up.  There is no wildlife where I live.  I don't have squirrels, deer, foxes, whatever else.  I put up spiky things for birds not to shit up my yard. I put cat prevention stuff down to deter cats.   So yes, I don't like it when wild animals shit in my yard either.  ",

        "selftext": "I run a TNR program for feral cats. Non profit, I catch all cats and get them the medical attention they need myself, out of my own pocket. I love helping them. A lot of the cats are not able to be rehomed, so I fix them and release them. Get them their shots and hope for the best. I am not a large scale operation. Recently I was called to an area overrun with orange cats. They were everywhere and I mostly ended up handing it over to professionals. I did, however, manage to grab three very sweet cats. Two were terrified, skinny, a little beaten up, but overrall friendly. The third one was a little gent.  He was tubby, well groomed, fish patterned collar, the works. My plan was to find his parents and drop him off with a warning to keep him in due to the large amount of traps being set. Then the little bastard sprayed the inside of my car to the freakin max. So, apparently, he wasn't fixed. I couldn't really tell (longhair) and assumed he was so left my covers off. Big mistake! I debated taking him home or taking him to get neutered with the rest. He was an indoor-outdoor cat (indicated by his collar tag) and with so many strays I'm certain some were carrying his genetics. Ultimately I took him with me and got him neutered. No chip so I called the number on his tag and informed them where their cat was and gave them time slots to pick him up or have him dropped off. The owners went ballistic. They were cursing me out and came to collect their cat not twenty minutes later. Called me a kidnapper, blamed me for their child having nightmares (scared over their cat going missing). I tried to explain that he needed to be fixed if he was going to be outside but they didn't want to know. They said I should have called immediately regardless. I spoke to my rescue friend who said I was in the wrong. Even though we know we are technically in the right, we didn't have the legal ground to do that and it wasn't my decision to make.  I did apologise, but have blocked their numbers (the mom is flaming me on facebook and dm'ing people I know). I have a duty to care for stray cats. Me knowing an unneutered male was roaming free and not doing anything about it was a concern for said stray cats. Things are still tense between my rescue buddy and I and I don't completely disagree. I know I crossed a line even if it was for the greater good. People are finding out and taking sides, so I'm not sure who to really believe was right here. So... AITA?",

        "selftext": "So super weird situation and need a judgement. I (32M) have been engaged to Amanda (34F) for about a year, we dated for 3. She has a 12 year old daughter named Alexis. Me and Alexis have a good relationship. Me, Amanda and her ex all have a good relationship for the most part. I\u2019m totally comfortable with my role. So Amanda, her ex and Alexis have this weird thing they do. They all get together on Sundays and hangout the three of them. I guess it started as a family tradition and then once they divorced they kept it going. They make breakfast, watch movies and just hang around all day together. I find it really weird tbh. Like I\u2019m not insecure about it, but why you would want to spend a day a week with your ex is beyond me. I said how weird I found this when we started dating but Amanda said that Alexis looks forward to it weekly so she never stopped it. So at first I would just hang in our room or the basement all Sunday. But I got tired of being trapped in my own house so I started leaving the whole day. Amanda would never ask where I was going or anything. Wouldn\u2019t even notice I was gone.  So at first I was golfing or getting errands done. Or would find a bar. But then I reconnected with my old friend Bella. Bella and me dated 5 years ago and have remained good friends since. She just broke up with her husband and moved into a new apartment. I told her one Sunday that I was just planning on going to the movies and she instead invited me over. We smoked some weed, watched some movies, cooked and just hung out. It was nice and ever since it\u2019s become my weekly tradition. Whenever Sunday would come I\u2019d head over to Bella\u2019s and we\u2019d just hangout all day.  I didn\u2019t see the need to bring up to Amanda where I was going. She never asked or even wondered where I was every Sunday. So yesterday Bella stopped by our house to drop off my phone charger because I left it at her place. Amanda asked why Bella had my phone charger. And I told her that it\u2019s where I was on Sunday. She asked why I was there and I told her that was my Sunday hangout spot. She flipped out. Saying how rude it was to not let her know I was hanging out with an ex. I laughed and said \u201cdo you really not see the irony with that statement\u201d. She said it\u2019s different because she was forthcoming about her/ex\u2019s relationship and that if I had an issue with it then I should have said so. I said I did already bring it up and that she said it was important to her daughter. Was I supposed to interfere with the highlight of her daughters week in order to make myself feel better? No I\u2019ll just sneak out the back door and head to my friends house. And that I didn\u2019t see why this was even an issue at all. We trust each other and are adults. Amanda doesn\u2019t want me over there anymore and said she wants me to find another way to spend my Sundays. I said then I don\u2019t want your ex over here on Sundays anymore if that\u2019s how we\u2019re playing this. AITA? Update: some shit has already hit the fan with the whole situation. I\u2019ve put my foot down and said I\u2019m not being forced out of my house anymore. That they can do Sunday funday at her ex\u2019s place moving forward. I\u2019ll post a complete update when I can. I did want to clarify that the reason I don\u2019t hang out with them is that I was asked not to at first. Then I always felt awkward about the whole thing. So at first I stayed away because I was asked, then I felt like the fourth wheel so I decided to quit trying. Bella has really helped because she went through something similar with her SO.",

        "selftext": "My girlfriend (22F) and I (26M) have been together for almost 4 years and live together. She has a stable career and has bought herself a car and was taught to drive in high school.  I was never taught to drive, and it\u2019s not really necessary because I can uber, take the bus, or my girlfriend can drive. She\u2019s offered before to teach me to drive, but I decline because I\u2019m not really interested in learning because I don\u2019t plan on getting a car since they\u2019re a lot of money.  So, my birthday was yesterday and my girlfriend was really excited to give me my gift. It was private driving lessons, which admittedly cost her several hundred dollars. I was really offended because I don\u2019t want to learn to drive. She hyped the gift up like I\u2019d love it, but I honestly hate it. It seems more like it\u2019s for her because she wants me to learn to drive, than it is for me.  I got really upset and disappointed when I opened it and she kept pushing to ask why I didn\u2019t like it. I told her again that I don\u2019t care for driving and it seemed like a really impersonal gift, because I don\u2019t even want my license or a car so why would I want this? I felt like she doesn\u2019t even know me. And she got really upset so I suggested she return the lessons and get me something I would like better.  Now she\u2019s calling me an AH and said the lessons are non-refundable, and is really upset with me. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the AH because I\u2019ve told her before that I don\u2019t want to drive and I feel like she\u2019s trying to change me. So now she\u2019s being immature and won\u2019t drive me anywhere and tells me I can uber if I want to go somewhere, even if it\u2019s somewhere she was going to go already. Like she went thrifting and to the grocery store without me (we always go together) and said if I really wanted to go that badly, I can uber.  It\u2019s not even like I ask her for rides ever, I just tag along if she\u2019s already going somewhere. I get uber\u2019s to and from work and have a good job. So it\u2019s pointless for me to even get a car or license.  When I told her that she said that she\u2019s tired of always being the driver and likes to be the passenger sometimes, but to me it sounds like she gave me a gift that *she* wants. Because if she hates being the driver so much, I suggested that I could get lessons for *her* birthday, not mine, and that upset her even more. She said that isn\u2019t a gift for her and she\u2019d be upset if I got myself driving lessons for her birthday. I told her basically \u201csee, so you\u2019d be upset if I got you something that you think is for me for YOUR birthday\u201d and she said yes. So even though I explained to her there\u2019s a double standard, she\u2019s still insisting that I\u2019m the AH.",

        "selftext": "My SIL (married to my brother) is a resident physician who works 60-80hr weeks and frequently works 1 or both days of the weekend. Her residency is a 7hr drive from where me, my husband and my baby girl (1.5yr old). My brother and I were always very close growing up and even lived in the same apartment and later same city. We were never more than 20-30m away from each other. I got married and had my baby and he moved 7hrs away to be with his fiance, now wife, pretty soon after I had my baby. It was devastating for me as I had always pictured us being close and him really involved as an uncle. SIL works 6am-5:30pm 6-7 days a week but does have some golden weekends where she has Saturday and Sunday off. She usually has one per month and then she has 3 weeks of vacation (never over Christmas or New Years holidays). During those 1 weekend a month that she has completely off, her and my brother either stay at home because she needs to relax or will drive 2hrs to see her family. During the 3 weeks of vacation, which she is only able to take 1 week at a time, they went on a 1 week long trip to Hawaii, a 1 week long trip to Cancun with her family and then 1 week where they just visited her family 2 hrs away. They haven't made the trip to visit us more than 1-2x a year as they say the drive is too hard with the limited time off she has and she's usually too tired to come anyways. But not too tired for Hawaii or Cancun? They always ask my parents and us to visit them during holidays she works so at least we can be together and she will join everyday after 5. But, it's hard for us to travel with a 1.5 year old. My parents have to split time visiting there and visiting us and we need them for childcare. I've been asking my brother and SIL to visit us more even though I know her schedule is busy and my brother got frustrated with me. When I asked him to visit alone, he said she needs him because the heavy workload has been really mentally straining on her and quoted how resident physicians have a really high depression rate and basically called me TA. I feel its unfair we have to visit all the time considering we have a 1 year old  and also both work FULL TIME and feel they should balance better to visit us rather than just vacation.
