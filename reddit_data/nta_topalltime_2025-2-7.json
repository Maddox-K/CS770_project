        "selftext": "My brother in-law (Sammy) lost his home shortly after his divorce 10 months ago. He moved in with us and brought his twin daughters (Olivia & Sloane18) with him a couple of months ago.His sister (my wife) and I have one daughter (Zoey 16) and she and her cousins aren't close but get along fine. Olivia & Sloane have no respect for Zoey's privacy, none. they used to walk into her room and take everything they get their hands on. Makeup, phone accessories, clothes, school laptop etc. Zoey complained a lot and I've already asked the girls to respect Zoey's privacy and stop taking things. My wife and Sammy saw no issue with this. After all, they're girls and this's typical teenage girls behavior. I completely disagreed.  Last straw was when Zoey bought a 60$ m.a.c makeup-kit that looks like a paintset that she saved up for over a month and one of the girls, Sloane took it without permission and ruined it by mixing shades together while using it. Don't know much about makeup but that's what Zoey said when she found the kit on her bed, and was crying.I told my wife and she said she'd ask Sloane to apologize but I got Zoey a lock after I found she was moving valuable belongings out the house because of this incidence!!! Sammy and his daughters saw the lock and weren't happy, the girls were extremely upset.Sammy asked about it and I straight up told him. He said my daughters aren't thieves!!! it's normal that girls of the same age borrow each others stuff he said Zoey could easily get another makeup kit for 15 bucks from walmart and shouldn't even be buying expensive - adult makeup in the first place and suggested my wife take care of this defect in Zoey's personality trying to appear older than she is.He accused me of being overprotective and babying Zoey with this level of enablement. I told him this's between me and my wife but she shamed me for putting a lock on Zoey's door for her cousins to see and preventing them from spending time with her saying I was supposed to treat them like daughters, then demanded I remove it but I said this lock does not get removed til her brother and his daughters are out of our house. She got mad I was implying we kick them out and said her family'll hate me for this. so I reminded her that I let Sammy and his family move in which's something her OWN family refused to do so she should start with shaming/blaming them for not taking their own son and nieces/granddaughters in. if it wasn't for her family's unwillingness to help we wouldn't be dealing with this much disturbance at home. Everyone's been giving me and Zoey silent treatment and my wife is very much upset over this.",

        "selftext": "I'll try to keep this short. I had a [1967 Impala 4 door](https://i.imgur.com/HLBPpTF.jpg) that I bought in Feb 2019. A couple months ago I bought my first house that had a 2.5 car garage. I moved the car in and started tearing it down for a complete restoration. I had the body in one bay and the chassis in another, plus the whole garage filled with parts. About two months ago my girlfriend came to live with me during this whole crisis and the whole time has hated that car. She wants to park in the garage but I have 2 acres of land with a lot of nice places to park under shady trees or hell even in the barn if it has to be inside. I tell her tough luck its my house and its not like I can just throw it back together real quick. Anyways I was out of town for a couple days on a business trip for the small local company I work for. When I got back, my girlfriend was all smiles. Making me food all the time, doing all the chores, all that. I though maybe she just was happy to have me home but then I realized that I didn't see her car in it's usual spot. I asked her where she parked so I could make sure I mow that area and keep it clean and she said not to worry because she parked in the garage. I asked how and she told me to go check it out. Turns out that while I was gone she hired some people to come over and move everything related to that car, including the drivetrain, body, and chassis and all parts, and take it to the local dump/scrapyard. I was absolutely dumbfounded. I had spent over 11k on that car including new parts, services, and the car itself. I told her that I was going to be taking her to court for that and she brushed me off like I was being dramatic. I told her that its done between us and to pack her things and leave. I admit I was a really angry but I did end up getting a lawyer, and as I have all the receipts for all that money spent and I have her on my house's security cam footage letting the guys in and watching them take it all I think I can win. Her family and friends are absolutely blowing me up saying its just a stupid old piece of junk and that she cannot pay back all that money I spent, and that I should just let it go. But I have been putting all my time, effort, and money into that car for a year and a half now and goddammit if I am not going to get justice for what she did. AITA Edit: Thank you all so much for the support and awards and everything. I'm glad I have some people on my side. I got a call from her mom about 20 minutes ago and she told me that i was ruining her daughter's life over a stupid car. I told her she ruined her own life. I've been gathering documentation and stuff and I'm about to head down to the police station and file a report, as suggested by lots here. Once again thank you all UPDATE : went to the police station last night, was told to come back in the morning. just got back and filed an official report against her for grand larceny and grand theft auto. i showed them all the receipts i had for the car and the footage of her letting the guys come and take it as well as the title for the vehicle in my name. they said they will be in contact with all 3 parties (me, ex gf, and junkyard guys) soon and they will hopefully be able to recover some or all of the car. just have to wait now HUGE UPDATE : THEY FOUND MY GODDAMN CAR!! the junkyard guys apparently were in the middle of hiding it when the police came to ask them questions. it was on a forklift and they were gonna put it on top of a pile of cars that was hidden behind more piles of cars. they said it was theirs and they had the title, but obviously didnt have the title for it and since they matched the vin on the chassis and body to the vin on my title, it was obviously mine. I know at least one person there has been arrested, i think he was in the camera footage i talked about earlier but idk if it was the boss or whomever or even his specific charge, they also told me they would be looking into this specific junkyard for any other vehicles reported stolen. they said they haven't been able to get in contact with my ex just yet but they're working on it. im just so glad they found my car. luckily i made quite an album of pictures detailing me tearing down the car and so i can use that to prove what parts they had were mine so i can hopefully get most or all of it back. police haven't let me take it back home yet as they say it is evidence or something so hopefully i can get it back eventually. thank you all so much for the support and advice!

        "selftext": "I am a high schooler with a weekend job at a coffee shop. My coworkers who work weekends are:  James - the owners son, he goes to my school. He's a shift manager but it's not a real formal thing, he's a friendly guy. Danielle - A college student who sometimes works weekends too. So sometimes customers will come in and just be angry about such little stuff. Like literally blow up about nothing. I dunno if theyre in a bad mood already and looking for someone to take it out on or what, but it's a lot... Like how sad so your have to be to be a grown-ass man taking your anger out on high school and college kids. So James and I were joking about having a little fun with them and hopefully getting them off our backs. So one day I was at work and some guy was having a temper about how we don't make the coffee hot enough... Which I couldn't do a thing about because I gave it to him right out of the machine. So James came in and was like sir is there a problem here and the guy started ranting at him too. So he was just like OP, this is unacceptable, you're fired.  I started acting real sad, like no please don't fire me, my family needs the money, I need this job, pleaseeee and he played up being a hard-ass, telling me to take off my apron and leave. The angry guy started to backtrack, like It isn't that big of a problem, you don't need to fire her over it. I didn't mean it and James was like No, we pride ourselves on the best customer service Of course after all that drama I still had my job, we were just acting. And we've done it a couple times, whenever a customer will lose their temper at Danielle or I, James will storm in and fire us. And almost every time, the person who had come in angry will apologise and say that they didn't mean it. It's kind of satisfying, making people realize their actions might actually have consequences.  Anyway, I was telling my friends from school about this and a few of them thought it was a mean prank, to let someone go away thinking they'd gotten someone who desperately needs the money fired.

I also work hand in hand with the doctors and midwives to create a healthy maternity, birth, and postpartum situation.  My fiancee is completing her residency.  We live together and have for a few years now.  We aren't in any hurry to get married.  We originally had plans to do so a couple of years ago but then we got really busy for two years.   It is driving my very religious parents crazy that their youngest son is living in sin.  I don't really care.  I'm an adult and I do what I want.  We are getting married in June.   So we are visiting my parents for Christmas. The way it came together this year everyone is at my parents house.  So that's my folks, my three siblings, myself and fiancee, and seven grandchildren.  So seventeen people.   At dinner my mom starts going on about how she is so glad that we are finally getting married and she won't be embarrassed at church any more.  And my dad says how proud he is of his three older kids who all either waited to get married before moving in together or got married right away after moving in together.  My fiancee was getting embarrassed and I was getting mad over this stupid argument we have had too many times. And a family dinner was the last straw.   I have asked them repeatedly to just accept that they cannot control how I live my life.  I refuse to stay with them when I visit even if I come alone.  Hotels are just easier.   So I started talking about a premature baby I had been reading about.  It was almost three months premature and weighed about 1.6 pounds. It was super strong and healthy for being born so little and the NICU had high hopes for the baby doing well.   My mom and dad both got deer in the headlights looks on their faces.  To bad. Should not have fucked around with my fiancee's feelings.   So I asked about my oldest brother.  He was born almost four months premature.  Is there a chance that we could check out the family album where we keep all the records of family births and stuff.   I already know my brother was over 9 pounds and almost 23 long when he was born.  My grandmother told me all about it the first time my parents tried to shame me.  The subject gets changed very fast.  After supper my parents told me that I should not try to embarrass them with private things that are not my concern.  I told them that if I heard anything about my living arrangements ever again for the rest of my life I would make sure to keep bringing up the FACT that my mom was in her second trimester when they got married. My parents are mad at me for telling them how to behave in their own home.  But my fiancee is happy that they seem to be off the subject for good.   AITA?",

Ops sorry sister doesn\u2019t feel like going out. I am graduating ops sorry sister had a bad day at work. They have missed both major and smaller events in my life because of her melt downs. I met the love of my life. We decided to tie the knot. From the beginning I told my parents how I am worried my sister will ruin another special moment in my life. My mom told me over and over again it would not happen. The day of my wedding. I received a voicemail from my mom saying they couldn\u2019t come because my sisters dog was sick and she was upset. I was hurt, my best man however is a jokester. He took my phone then went to my fianc\u00e9 and asked if he could post a video of our wedding as a gift? On social media. She loved his idea. I had no idea about it until I came home. Our honeymoon was at a lake side cabin. No cell service. The post caption was \u201cMy best friend. He is an amazing person even if his parents NEVER showed up for him.  video was still pictures of us next to her parents, me on the dance floor, cutting the cake. Where you would normally see both parents in wedding pictures. The sound behind the video was my moms voice mail explaining how they couldn\u2019t come because my sisters dog was sick. I came home a week later to hundreds of messages.Family members from both sides insisting I take it down. I was told my sister hasn\u2019t stopped crying. My mom is refusing to leave the house.  I maybe the A here. I didn\u2019t take it down when I got my messages. I didn\u2019t call my family back right away. I waited until my vacation time was over at work and enjoyed my time with my Wife. In our new home. Before I contacted anyone. My dad told me to take down the video. It was \u201cjust a bad night for them\u201d. That they will make it up to me and my wife for not coming. My reply was exactly how do you plan to \u201cmake up\u201d my wedding? It\u2019s a once in a life time thing. You choose to ignore my feeling on the whole matter. Then he just repeated he will make it up to me. I told him I would take down the video only when he made up missing my wedding. Flustered we both hung up the phone before we both said things we shouldn\u2019t have. Am I the A here. I could have just taken down the video.",

        "selftext": "About a week ago, my (39F) family ordered Chinese food for delivery. When the delivery driver came to the door, my daughter (16F) was taking the cat upstairs to put in her room because he always tries to eat the food. My son (13M)  loudly says, \u201cMake sure the hide the cat from the Chinese guy!\u201d as I am at the door getting the food from the Chinese delivery driver. He very obviously heard what my son said and was upset by it. I quickly apologized and took the food.  I told my son that racist jokes were completely unacceptable and very wrong and he refused to admit that he was in the wrong. So, later that night I forced my son to write a sincere apology to the delivery driver, (his name was on the receipt) as well as write a one page paper on Chinese culture and a one page paper on why racism is perpetuated by racist jokes and stereotypes. Then the next day I took him to the restaurant and had him read his apology aloud to the delivery driver as well as give him the papers he wrote. The driver was very appreciative of the apology and thanked me for making my son do it. He then told my son about multiple instances where he had faced racist comments and attacks from people while he was a delivery driver.  That night my husband (43M) and I got into an argument about me making our son do this. He told me that it was embarrassing for our son to have to do the apology and that the \u201cpunishment didn\u2019t fit the crime\u201d. I told him that it was much more embarrassing for the driver to have to face that kind of racism and racist stereotypes and that our son would get over the embarrassment. I do not condone any kind of hateful thinking in my house, and the fact that my son said that embarrassed me as well. My husband told me that it was \u201cjust a joke\u201d and it wasn\u2019t that big of a deal. I feel like I might have over reacted some but I think it\u2019s important to help my son understand how what he said was wrong and hurtful.",

My dad had a college fund for me, but he had stipulations like he wanted nothing below a B for grades and to pre approve any classes I take, weekly meetings to discuss grades and a bunch of other stuff.

My dad has a temper and I spent 6th-12th grade stressed out about grades and being screamed at or grounded over things that sometimes weren't even my fault like a teacher not updating online grading and an assignment being marked missing because of it.  And getting my back pack and locker randomly searched by him for no reason besides to make sure I'm not hiding anything .  I decided to pay for school myself because of 1 not being stressed over getting screamed at 2 I didn't feel like constantly worrying that he'd disapprove  of a class or a grade and decide not to pay.

We\u2019ve always been a meat eating family, we live in the rural Midwest and bacon for breakfast is pretty much a given. This year my 14 y/o daughter decided to go vegan, and I jumped onto her support team with enthusiasm. We learned how to substitute ingredients, cook new things, try new things, I adjusted our budget to include more expensive vegan substitutes for her, etc.  None of this has been a problem for me until recently. She saw me cook bacon in a pan, and then I rinsed it out to load in the dishwasher. She exploded in anger (teen years, I\u2019m not too fussed about the anger explosion, I know she doesn\u2019t mean it) and said that that was HER pan for vegan food. I was completely floored and said, kiddo this here is a family pan, older than you, it\u2019s not YOUR pan.  She asked me to purchase her a pan that she can solely use for vegan food. I didn\u2019t want her to feel weird about food, so I said sure, and ordered her a few colored ones that are only for her. The reason they\u2019re colored is so it helps me remember that I\u2019m not to touch them unless I\u2019m cooking vegan.  That wasn\u2019t good enough. Now apparently the dishwasher is \u2018contaminated\u2019 with animal product, and the fridge has \u2018bacon grease fingers\u2019 on it (because I eat bacon and then touch the fridge) and she\u2019s asked me and her mom to completely stop eating meat at home. I don\u2019t mean I literally touch the fridge with greasy bacon hands, because I wash my hands, but it\u2019s clearly enough that it upsets my daughter.  frankly I\u2019m on team hell no, her mom is much more amenable and strongly wants me to consider taking our daughter up on the request. My wife\u2019s reasoning is that both our parents live close so we can eat meat products there, and that she doesn\u2019t want our daughter to feel uncomfortable in the kitchen. My daughter says she is fine with cheese and butter in the fridge, but it\u2019s specifically meat products that make her feel sick. Now I\u2019m sorry for her, but I feel like she just needs to adapt and live side by side, because I\u2019m not going to stop eating bacon in my own house.",

I told him dinner was ready and he goes what's for dinner tonight, B*TCH ... With like a lot of emphasis on the last word.  I was fed up, I'd had a pretty rough day with work and I have some awfully bad associations with that word being used by other people in my life who were pretty abusive.

And I better not hear you using that word again, it's for the girls He was freaking out about how sauce had landed on his rug and he even said you're seriously acting like a bitch right now, I dunno what else to call it I just walked out and got takeout for myself and went to my friends house. She thought it was funny but my boyfriend was furious, he kept texting and calling and sending me voice memos trying to explain that saying what's for dinner tonight b*tch was a TikTok trend.... And that he was just quoting something as a joke to put on tiktok.  I thought that was the shittiest excuse ever, it doesn't matter if he saw it as a joke, or stole the joke, it was still disrespectful.  But it didn't change the fact he thought that shit was funny, to demean me when I was trying to do him a favor. Like hell I came over when he was studying to make a home cooked dinner and he decides it's time for jokes? So I put my phone on don't disturb for the night and split a bottle of wine with my friend and her roommate.  The next morning he was sending me angry texts demanding I clean his rug because he was too busy with exams to do it. I was shocked he left it overnight, that's disgusting. I texted him back saying. Yeah so that's the b*tch tax honey :) leave me alone till you're ready to handle your own cooking and cleaning because this b*tch isn't anymore. Also it's vile you left that soaking in all night He called me and told me that he was okay with doing his own household work, but I did throw a full pot of sauce at the ground so that's on me to clean up.  I told him yeah no I'm not comfortable doing chores for you if you see me like your b*tch  He told me he didn't and it was just a trend and I got pissed off he was playing that TikTok trend BS excuse again and I told him Well I'm starting a trend called 'saucing' where as a little joke people throw pasta sauce around! You can't be mad because it's just a little trend, a little jokey joke, just a little prank bro!  He got really pissed off and hung up on me and now I'm seriously wondering if this dumb fucking tiktok joke is gonna be the end of things between us AITA for how I reacted when my boyfriend asked me what's for dinner tonight, b*tch Edit to address a comment I've gotten a lot and I don't have time to reply to every time: > But did you tell him not to call you a bitch? Like how would he know otherwise? Honestly if someone has gotten to the age of 30 and not realized that women (as a whole) do not like having demeaning slurs used against them... They're beyond my help.  This isn't something that needs to be told. I shouldn't have to go through life like Hey man just in case you were thinking I might like demeaning slurs against my gender used on me, I don't actually :) And if you were about to comment something like that, let me just tell you in no uncertain terms... WOMEN DO NOT LIKE BEING CALLED BITCHES BY MEN. DO NOT CALL WOMEN BITCHES. IF YOU NEEDED TO BE TOLD THAT IS UNKIND, CONSIDER YOURSELF OFFICIALLY TOLD. NOW YOU HAVE NO EXCUSE TO NOT UNDERSTAND",

        "selftext": " Context: My sister (F27) and I (18F) lost our dad a year ago. He was my only parent, mom was never in mine or my sister's life. Dad left money (inheritance) for me and sister and she used her inhertance to get new cars and renovate her houseI live with my aunt right now cause my brother inlaw didn't let me stay with my sister. I'm planning on using my inhertance money to pay for college tuition (I've always wanted to be doctor but haven't decided which branch yet). My sister & I haven't been close, it started after she got married to her chronically ill husband who was allowed to make backhanded comments about dad and mock his llness and make a scene at his funeral.only because he's ill and shouldn't be held accountable for his behavior.I've distanced myself But my sister kept visiting alot lately venting about my brother inlaws condition. He's been in & out the hospital for heart problems and in need for a surgery. She brought up my inheritance money several times but I end up cutting the conversation. She then straight up asked if I could help pay for her husband's surgery and she'd pay back in less than a year. I felt uneasy cause if I give her money from my inhertance which is a large amount then there's no gurantee she'll pay back before It's time to apply for college. I'm taking a year gap but I know my sister can't pay back that much and I felt I was risking my future. I refused to help and she had a melt down at my aunt's house calling me heartless, cruel with no empathy. She said that her husband's health should be a priority and I needed to help because education is nothing compared to someone's health and asked if I'd be happy to see her as a widow and my nephew with no father.My aunt suggested others pay but most of them cut my sister and her husband off. I argued that her husband's poor health isn't my fault after she kept blaming and guiltriping me. She kept crying and although my aunt decided to stay out of it she said that I should be prepared for permenant damage in my relationship with my sister if I don't help her now.  She's been sending texts and pictures of her family telling me this is what I was saying no to, a happy healthy family with a healthy husband and father. I cried and felt like I was being selfish not good aunt and sister. I asked my friend and he said let them sell the cars and all the luxurious stuff they bought to afford the surgery and warned me if I give them money I'll never get it back and may not be able to go to medical school.",

        "selftext": " I F30 don't have the best relationship with my husband's mom. Since day one she tried to make remarks and compare me to her ??. She then tried to get on my good side and started overly praising everything I do and sometimes even copying me like that one time when she LITERALLY dyied her hair purple just like mine and when everyone pointed out how ridiculous she looked, she actually blamed me and accused me of trying to make a joke out of her.  So, Anyways! My husband and I took 2 weeks off work to go visit some places out of the country - tourism in other words. Thing is I was the one who saved up for and arranged for the trip (my husband was responsible for booking the tickets). My husband's mom wanted to come along and threw temper tantrums when I said no. She called, texted, sent people to talk to me into letting her come, even threatened to call the police and make some complaint up to get us to stay if she can't come. My husband said we should just take her but I told him he was wrong to tell her about the trip in the first place. He gave me an ultimatim. said he wouldn't go if she can't come and I told him I'd gladly call his bluff which made him take his words back and say FINE! I will tell her to stop it because we won't take her. Things got quieter, suspeciously quieter. the day of the trip came and we got to the airport at 2pm. My husband was walking ahead of me and was looking left and right like he was looking for someone. I asked him but he didn't respond. He lead me to the waiting area and first thing I saw was his mom standing there with her luggage . I froze in my spot, I felt a cold wave washing over me and I was fuming inside. She and my husband were hugging that's when I quietly turned around and started walking towards the exit. My husband followed me while shouting at me to stop. he tried to stop me but I told him off the harshest way possible. He tried to say I was overreacting and that his mom was there anyway and I should let it go and not mess the trip up for us. I told him he and his mom could still go and that I was going home. I went home and sobbed into my dog's fur for several minutes. turned out he booked her a ticket without me knowing. an hour later he came home yelling and raging about how pathetic and spiteful I was to walk out and go home and ruin the trip last minute. I told him he caused this to happen. he said that I was being so hard on his mom it's ridiculous. I refused to fight any more but he kept on berating me then called my family to tell them that the trip was cancelled and that it was because of me. My family said that I shouldn't have ruined it for myself and should've sucked it up and done my best to enjoy. Did I really overreact?",

        "selftext": "So, Ever since I had my son months ago, my husband has started making indirect comments about my body. He never says any hurtful words but I find his observations as he calls it hurtful. For example, he'd see me wearing an old top and say oh that top used to look good on you but not anymore though... or when he looks at my waist and says Wow, didn't know your waist could get this wide!. Basically passive stuff that I tried to ignore til it extended to friends and family. FYI this went on for months and months and months!!.  We went to christmas celebration at his family's home. My SIL complimented my floral maxi dress and my husband said I agree it looks nice on you...though I have to admit that your waist could get smaller than this!. Awkward silence took over. I was absolutely fuming and this was my last straw. So I got up from my chair in the middle of dinner and shouted at the top of my lungs SHUT THE FUCK UP ABOUT MY BODDDYYY!!!!. He was absolutely speechless as his family stared while some others tried to get me to calm down but situation got more tense and dinner ended up being cut short and my husband storming off to his friend's place to spend the night upon leaving a very nasty text saying I embarrassed him and made a scene over an observation he made. He called me childish and told me to get therapy for my insecurities instead of verbally abusing him and scaring his family.  Now I feel like an absolute idiot asshole and like I ruined christmas for him and everybody with my over sensitivity. AITA??",

It was going fine until I found out that I was expected to pay for everyone at the table. My husband's mom joked about paying for dinner out of my  inheritance pocket which made me livid but I showed no reaction. Just silently paid for my own food/drinks. Then got up and made my way out of the restaurant. They were shouting after me like a crowd and my husband tried to get me to come back but I drove home. He got back at 3 a.m yeling at me saying I was pathetic to get up and walk out on him and his family after they *relied* on me to pay for their food and thougt I was gracious enough to do it BUT they were wrong.

        "selftext": "So my son had a long-distance gf recently for about two years. She was great, a really nice girl and we all loved her welcomed her with open arms. She was flying here constantly to visit him, like a weekend a month and he didn\u2019t lift a finger to go visit her.  I tried talking to him about it several times and told him he should really start looking into flying over to her instead of expecting her to do all the travelling. He said no. And my wife probably had something to do with it as she constantly told him she was afraid of him flying. I spoke to them both and said this girl is great for him, she was willing to move over to our country too, but said there was one condition and that was he\u2019d have to fly over to her country too. Which is fair enough.  He said no, he didn\u2019t want to fly or travel anywhere. My son was becoming lazier and lazier, eventually telling his gf and us that he was perfectly fine never travelling anywhere including holidays etc.  Last week, he told us she\u2019s dumped him. I went on her fb page as we\u2019re all still friends (she wrote us an apology letter about how she\u2019s upset it didn\u2019t work out but these things happen, so we\u2019re on good terms) and looks like she\u2019s with a new guy already. Me and my wife have no doubt she was seeing him whilst still in a relationship with my son.  I confessed to them both that I actually agree with her decision and he should have expected it. He did not treat her properly and I hope he learns lessons for the next one because he needs to make more of an effort. I said he deserves it for his lack of effort in the relationship and for essentially just allowing this girl to spend all her money and time coming here all the time.  Wife and son are very upset that I said this. Very very upset and my wife says I am being horrible.  AITA? I stand by what I said.",

        "selftext": "**TL;DR at bottom** For context: I've been married to my wife for ~10 years and we're a mixed-race couple (I'm Asian and she's Caucasian). I've gotten along with her family (MIL, BIL, SIL), but I always felt like her FIL and other SIL (Sarah) never liked me. I'm a professionally trained chef with 15+ years of experience and I work at a high-end Chinese restaurant (a spin-off of a popular one in Beijing) in a large US city. My crew and I have won several awards, and I've been explicitly told I'll be the next executive chef. Sarah is also a professionally trained chef and works at a popular upscale French restaurant in the city. She constantly brags about it and (no joke) compares herself out loud to Ramsay and Bourdain. Whenever I'm at my MIL and FIL's house and helping out in the kitchen, Sarah is *always* criticizing everything I do. Whether it's chopping, braising, marinating, etc., she always butts in with comments like Umm, I think you should actually do X like this.... I've been patient for my wife and side stepping those comments, saying things like Thanks, but I think I'll stick to the way I do it. Things came to a head two weeks ago when my wife, FIL, MIL, and I were in her parent's kitchen prepping dinner for my MIL's birthday. We were running a bit behind so things were heated (which I kind of like because it reminded me of work) and that's when Sarah walked in. She took one look at what I was doing, scoffed, and said something like Oh wow, okay, so that's not the right way of doing things. It hit a nerve and I pretty sternly told her to stop criticizing my cooking and that I'm also a chef like her. She laughed and said making Kung Pao chicken at some Chinese restaurant doesn't count. The kitchen went silent, FIL snorted/chuckled, and my MIL yelled SARAH WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU. I stopped what I was doing, swore at her and called her a racist piece of shit, apologized to my MIL for not being able to stay, and left for home with my wife. Apparently this caused a massive fight after we left, with my MIL/BIL/other SIL taking my side and my FIL/Sarah saying it was a joke but kind of true and that I was being too sensitive. The extended family somehow got wind of this and now everyone is arguing and taking sides, with my wife even getting texts from some her cousins apologizing for Sarah's behavior. Despite being on my side, my wife is begging me to apologize so that the fighting will stop but I refuse to because fuck Sarah and her blatant racism. AITA? **TL;DR:** I'm a chef working at upscale Chinese resto, my SIL is a chef at upscale French resto. She's critical of my cooking skills and has now called it making Kung Pao chicken at a Chinese restaurant. Family at war, wife begging me to apologize, what do? **EDIT:** My wife has also informed me that now Sarah may be in trouble at work and she's blaming me for it. Apparently one of her co-workers heard her rant about what happened and reported it to management. (Edit: To clarify Sarah is blaming me, though my wife is partly blaming me) **EDIT2/UPDATE:** So it looks like one of my wife's cousins found this post and put it on Sarah's Facebook wall going This is you right?.... Her FB friends are starting to comment with things like If this is you Sarah then I'm disappointed. I think Sarah's still at work - shit might be hitting the fan soon and now my wife is pissed too. Will try to update but might have to delete post if things go nuclear **EDIT3/UPDATE2:** Was considering removing but I just got a voicemail from my FIL that [my] presence was only being tolerated up until this point and threatened a world of hurt if I didn't delete this post. Officially going to keep this post up and if you're still reading this Doug - I'm very disappointed in you, you're better than this. Will also continue to update and thanks again for all your support folks **EDIT4/UPDATE3:**  *Lots of stuff just went down* 1. My wife got a call from SIL. (From wife's paraphrasing) Sarah started screaming/crying at her the moment my wife picked up and said that she just got demoted because of [her] {Asian slur} husband. Apparently some of her co-workers have her on FB and showed the post to management, which combined with her earlier rant, double whammied her back to being a line cook and now she might get fired. My wife told her to go fuck herself and is now solidly on my side after taking the verbal abuse from Sarah and reading some of the comments here. My wife is still the opposite of happy though...2. Wife called MIL and asked her WTF was going on with FIL. MIL was confused so my wife played back the voicemail I had on my phone and apparently my MIL literally just walked away from the phone without hanging up and started screaming at FIL.3. Facebook post has now devolved into a clusterfuck flame war with family and friends jumping in. Suffice to say, it has officialy gone nuclear [Me right now](https://i.imgur.com/8QnGdHK.gifv) I think I'm going to have to call this a day, will make an update post when the dust settles. Thanks again folks **EDIT5/UPDATE4:** Turns out I'm not allowed to post an update post for some reason:> No, you provided all your updates in the original post with your many, many edits. You can edit this in, but we will not be allowing a standalone update on this. *I'd like to clarify that I got my wife and MIL's permissions to post this update (out respect for them and their privacy)* Suffice to say, it's been kind of nuts this past week. My wife and I had to turn off social media for a bit because of the shitstorm caused by her cousin putting my last post on Sarah's Facebook page. Some people even tried to call the restaurant I work at to get me fired as retribution, but luckily everyone there is 100% on my side (or as my boss put it Fuck [Sarah], fuck those racists, fuck them so goddamn much). I guess it didn't help them that half the calls involved threats, screaming, and more racial slurs. We didn't hear any updates from her family, even though we assumed the shit met fan after MIL found out about FIL's threatening voicemail (*still disappointed in you Doug*). But that changed on Sunday night, when MIL suddenly showed up at our door with overnight bags. After we took a moment to help unpack and calm down, she spilled the beans on everything. **FIL (aka Doug)** Apparently my MIL and FIL were already having trouble in their marriage, and it was only made worse with a certain 2016 Presidential election (she's a Dem, and he had apparently gone more far-right since then). Seems that a line was crossed with the Kung Pao Incident and his voicemail. When he refused to apologize for anything (typical Doug), she asked for a divorce and he went beserk. She didn't feel safe there so that's when she came over (other BIL and SIL live out of town). **Extended Family (aka The Great FB War of 2021)** You may have been able to tell already, but the extended family was largely arguing/fighting/divided along political lines for a few years now and my cousin's FB post was likely just the light to set off the powder keg. According to my MIL, the fallout has allegedly already led to some break-ups, excommunication of some family members, and even an argument that ended with police involvement. Haven't verified this myself though. **Sarah / SIL** According to my MIL, Sarah came over to her place on Friday. The writing was on the wall and she was basically forced to quit. Despite her trying to start from scratch as a line cook, the entire staff turned against her. Nothing was coming back from the (dish) pit for her and she was getting the cold shoulder. She\u2019s a great chef (I will admit this is true), but they took no chances since it turns out (shit you not)... they're partly owned by a Chinese investment company. Found this hard to believe and didn't want to add this detail, but it turned out to be true after some research (won't say any further for privacy). Word also got around in the local industry, and Sarah is essentially blacklisted from high-end establishments. She's now considering selling her home and moving to find work. As much as I don't like her and found her behavior horrifying, I didn't intend for this to happen so I've reached out to some buds in other states to see if they had any openings. Whether or not she wants to take itis up to her (and no, she has not apologized for anything either - but I still want to be a decent person to her). It sure as hell doesn't feel like a happy ending. Perhaps bittersweet justice, but that's all I can give you. Thank you all for your support and for reading.  [Still me right now.](https://i.imgur.com/8QnGdHK.gifv)",

I\u2019m the only girl and have 3 brothers.  Because of their expectation I\u2019d stay home with kids, they never valued my education, educational achievements or emphasized things beyond domestic skills. I\u2019m the second youngest. By the time I was in high school, my two older brothers had gone to the college of their choice, with my parents fully covering tuition, books, an off campus apartment and other living expenses. They eventually did the same for my younger brother. I was told I wasn\u2019t allowed to apply for college. I did so in secret and got accepted with a partial scholarship. I didn\u2019t tell them I was moving out until a week before I left, with essentially nothing but what a few friends gave to me that their parents bought \u201cthem\u201d for college. I took engineering, and had to work, take on debt and struggle. My parents and I have barely spoken for years. I\u2019m married now and expecting our first child, and they asked to meet up. We met at a park, and they said they were \u201csorry if they caused me pain\u201d but would like a relationship now. I asked them specifically what they were sorry for. They wouldn\u2019t elaborate and just said they wanted to move forward. I said that wasn\u2019t sufficient. In the end, I said they could prove they were sorry by forwarding me the $100k my degree and college expenses were, just like they did for my brothers. My mom burst into tears, my dad said I wasn\u2019t being serious and I just left. Since then, I\u2019ve been getting calls from my brothers telling me I\u2019m being immature and hurtful. I don\u2019t think so at all.",

        "selftext": "New to reddit, please bare with.  So I (21, guy) live with my childhood best friend (22, also a guy) and have done for 2 years now. Up until last week, things were perfect between us.  However, he recently got a new girlfriend (23, lady) and she honestly seems absolutely great except for one thing; she seemingly has a complete aversion to knocking. She and I have quite a lot in common, and I actually like spending time with her. However it bugs the hell out of me when she just barges into my room without knocking first. Now, she's never walked in on me doing anything untoward; I'm usually just chilling on my bed or studying at my desk. However, on at least seven seperate occasions now she's done it first thing in the morning to ask if I want coffee. I sleep naked. Every time prior to the last one, I've been under the covers and she hasn't seen anything. I always point out that she *could* have and she just giggles and says but I didn't.  When she stayed over last week, in order to make my point, I intentionally slept on top of the covers. Sure enough, she barges in at 7AM, begins to ask if I want coffee and sees my you-know-what. She immediately backed out of the room and didn't speak to me for the rest of the day. My mate later pulled me aside and said I was bang out of order, accused me of deliberately exposing myself and pointed out that I'd threatened to do it before (I literally just said okay but what if I had no covers and you saw everything before). They're now framing this to others that I'm some sick creep who intentionally got naked and lay in wait of her because that's how I get my rocks off, and I'm kinda seeing how it came off that way. AITA for doing this?",

        "selftext": "The title makes me sound horrible but hear me out.  My sister is severely autistic. She requires attention almost 24/7 and cannot be left alone. She is non-verbal and cannot take care of herself at all. Despite the fact that she is only 12 she is extremely destructive and violent and destroys anything she gets her hands on.  I hate her. That should be wrong to say but it doesn't feel like it.  I was only 6 years old when she was born and since then i've never solely had my parents attention. Even since I can remember the world has revolved around her. I was moved out of my room into the basement at 7 because she needed to be in the room next to my parents. All of my toys as a child were destroyed by her and my parents simply ignored me when I complained. Even when I was 14 and she destroyed a mac my school gave me I was in the wrong.  Along with this I am expected to take care of her and drop everything I do for her. I can never make plans with friend because my parents expect me to be there if they need me to take care of her. Even when I do somehow get time to myself I am required to leave if they need me. If i do not then I am punished. The recent example of this is when I went to see the new spider man movie, and was grounded because i turned my phone off in the theater.  It seems as if I am nothing more than a slave to them and anything involving her simply overshadows me. This last week I was chosen to give a speech at a school event. I was so exited and my parents promised to be there, but they never showed and claimed it was because of my sister. Anytime anything like this happens for me they are to busy with her.  I've held this in for so long and it finally spilled out today. While talking about colleges with my father, he joked that I should get a degree that pays well so when their gone I can take care of my sister. I don't know why but this caused me to break down. I cried and screamed about how it always about her. I'm nothing more than a caretaker to them, that they always make it about her and that I'm expected to be her slave for the rest of my life.  I've locked myself in my room since then and my parents have not come to check on me. Am i the asshole here?  Edit/Update kinda: Wow, thank you for all the support and love that you guys have given me. I never expected this post to reach the popularity it did. Thank you all. After thinking about it for these past hours, you are right that I don't despise my sister. It's not her fault that she was born the way she is. My parents came to talk to me a while after my break down but I was unable to bring myself to talk to them and only cried and asked them to leave. They have made arrangements with my grandfather for me to stay with him for the time being and am getting ready to go to his house. My parents want to talk to me but we have decided it's best I leave for now to have some space and time to collect myself. we will be sitting down and talking later this week about this issue. Thank you all again for the love and support through this <3  I'll send an update your guy's way later this week if people are interested. ",

        "selftext": "Me and 2 other guys share an apartment together and we split all the bills. The only thing we don\u2019t split costs on is groceries. Everyone\u2019s in charge of buying their own food and we don\u2019t touch whatever doesn\u2019t belong to us in the fridge. We put our names on everything so no one gets mixed up.  This issue has been going on almost a year and I\u2019m sick of it.  One of my roommates, R, keeps stealing my food. I get home from work and containers with my leftovers are sometimes missing (they have my name written on it), or my stuff finishes too quick. My gallon of milk for example. I buy almond milk because I like the taste. But it seems to finish after a week even though I\u2019ve only drank once or twice.  I confronted R about this lots of times and that\u2019s caused a lot of arguments. He outright denies it and tells me I\u2019m crazy even though it\u2019s so obvious.  My other roommate and I carpool together because we both work the same early morning shifts around the same area so I know it\u2019s not him. It\u2019s always after we get back home and R\u2019s already left for work that I notice my food\u2019s gone. My roommate\u2019s also had a similar problem but not as often as I do. I\u2019m guessing cause R doesn\u2019t like what he buys. The funny thing is R buys a lot for himself and is even more stingy about his food. He will literally point out what\u2019s his when he comes back from grocery shopping and tells us not to touch it. Last week, my milk was nearly empty again and I got fed up. I went to the liquor store and bought regular dairy milk. I drank what was left of my almond milk and refilled the gallon with the one I bought. This was to catch/prove R is the one stealing since he\u2019s lactose intolerant.  The nxt day, Saturday, we get back from work and R is pissed. He yelled at me that he was stuck in the bathroom for 40 mins with diarrhea because of my milk; he was using it to make a shake. I only responded with \u201cSo then you\u2019re the one who\u2019s been stealing?\u201d  He freaking exploded. Yeah he admitted he was \u201csometimes\u201d drinking my milk and eating my food but he was more mad that I switched milks than the fact that he was caught. I told him I wouldn\u2019t have done that if he\u2019d just stopped taking my stuff from the fridge or at least told the truth instead of tryna make it seem like I was making it up. My roommate backed me up and thought it was kinda funny he got payback for stealing from us. It\u2019s a little tense rn and my roommate told me R is trying to convince him to agree to kick me out. Little does he know we\u2019re both looking to move somewhere else together cause we are sick of his shit.   I told some buddies what happened and a few think I was an asshole for that. I feel like I\u2019m not in the wrong here. He was taking my food and not even owning up to it and I wanted to prove it, does that make me TA?",

        "selftext": "I 23m was repeatedly stuck playing the part of helper and babysitter on family outings. I had to move out of my parents' house because I kept being forced to help watch my three nephews. Last year we took a family vacation in summer to the coast. I rode along with my parents, and they paid for my hotel room. Only, I had to share that room with three rowdy boys because my sister and her husband wanted a room to themselves. I was promised time to do my own things on the vacation. But instead I ended up having to help with these kids. I complained to everyone about it, and was reminded I was there for free. And then we pretty much just did only one thing I wanted to do. Which was tour an art gallery. I like doing this whenever I'm at the coast. But the kids find it boring. This year my parents have a beach trip planned for June. And they assumed I'd be riding along the same way as last year. But I refused. I said I'd be driving myself, and paying for my own hotel stay to have my own room. My parents were shocked, and tried to remind me of the cost. I said it was no worry. I've got a good job and a decent running car. I can more than afford it. That's when the Buts started. I stated the previously listed things as why I'll be driving myself and paying for myself. I want to be able to enjoy this vacation as an adult, and not be treated like a child like last year. My parents told my sister, and she called to blow up at me that I'll be ruining the vacation if I'm off doing my own thing while she has to wrangle her three boys. I ended up yelling at her that last year all she did was rope me into her mess. I didn't really get to do much of anything I wanted to do. And I was treated like the bad guy for wanting to just go to an art gallery. I'm a grown man. I deserve my own vacation too. Now my sister is not speaking to me, and my parents are still trying to convince me to just ride with them to keep the peace. I'm still refusing. But the pressure is getting to me. AITA for not giving in? I know they'll have a pretty hard time when they won't have another person there to help. Edit: It's barely been an hour since I posted. But my sister is apparently a reddit lurker in the mornings, and she saw my post. Not only is she furious with me. But she's also upset no one in the comments is siding with her. To make it short, she went on a big rant about how it's so hard to be a parent to triplets. And the least I could do is help because I'm young and single, and she needs a break. I stood my ground on my decision, and now she's calling our parents to get them involved. I'm expecting a call from them any minute. Update: Well I'm off work now, so I can tell more of what went down. I guess you could say it's over. My sister got our parents involved, they looked at my post, and were absolutely horrified by the continuous influx of commenters. Yes they're very angry with me that I posted here. But I told them that if they'd just listened to me to begin with, I'd have never needed to. I'm sick of the whole keep the peace mentality that sacrifices me to placate my sister. They in turn went off on my sister, and to make a long story short the whole vacation has been canceled. The hotel wasn't booked yet anyway. But my parents are arguing with my sister, my sister is blaming me, and my nephews are crying because they aren't going to the beach. My sister called me at lunch and basically implied I have no life, which is why I have time to help. I recorded that and told our parents, and that's currently what they're fighting about. Smol Update: I wasn't gonna update again. But here's a little more. Parents said that they won't ever push babysitting of my nephews on me again, and have agreed that what happened last year was unfair to me. Right now they're VERY angry with my sister for telling me I should help her because she thinks I have no life. My sister is playing the victim. And my brother in law is basically saying Nope! to the whole mess and spending most of his time at work.  Thank you to everyone who has commented. You made my day.",

        "selftext": "My (23F) wedding was back on Saturday December 31st and I'm still getting backlash from this, so I want to know if this was an AH move. In the country I live in it's currently winter, and we get a fair amount of snow so my wedding was a winter themed wedding. The color theme was forest green and gold. My dress was obviously white, and I chose the color of my bridesmaids dresses to be forest green as well. My MOHs dress was black, and everyone was to wear gold accessories.  I have this friend, we'll call her Kat, that I asked to be one of my bridesmaids. When we went dress shopping and I told them the color theme I was going for, Kat immediately expressed that she thought forest green was a bad choice. She said the thinks it's not a flattering color, and thought I should choose something different and more girly. I said no because my wedding was winter themed and I thought the color would go perfect with the theme. She suggested a pink, blue even a red. I said no, but thanks' for your opinion. She found out my MOHs dress was black and asked if she could wear black too? I said no, only my MOH is wearing black.  I paid for all the dresses.  Fast forward to wedding day, everyone's getting their hair and makeup done and Kat show's up 30 minutes late holding a bag that looked like it had a dress inside. I asked her what this was for? She told me it was for later on at the reception if she got uncomfortable and wanted to change after pictures. I was like ok cool. So fast forward we're all dressed and walking down the stairs because the ceremony is beginning in 30 mins and we were going to take some pictures before. Kat is the last person to come down and she's wearing a BLACK DRESS. At the time I was preoccupied taking pictures with my parents, but my MOH came over to me and made me aware of the situation.  I confronted Kat and asked her what was going on. She said she hates her bridesmaid dress, as the color is ugly and makes her look gross so she's wearing black. I told her please go back and change. She refused and started walking away from me. I said I'm going to ask her one more time, and if she doesn't oblige I'm calling security and kicking her out.  She began yelling at me to fuck off, so I called security and asked them to please escort her out. She started making a BIG scene yelling how I'm such a bitch, that I can't force her to wear anything and that I'm a horrible inconsiderate friend.  The wedding went on and it was truly amazing. Ever since the wedding Kat has been blowing up my phone with texts saying some really nasty thing's and asking for the money back she spent on the black dress, since it was a waste and she didn't get to wear it. I had to block her number. Some of my other bridesmaids have been giving me shit saying that it was a little harsh kicking her out and embarrassing her like that. And that maybe I should give her the money back. AITA for kicking her out?",

It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family.  My ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf.  She was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board.  Long story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids.

I went all-out, because honestly if we were out 5 grand, after insurance, that would fuck up our holiday plans pretty bad.  So I... - had him call the hospital and authorize me to handle his bill and access his medical records.  - got an itemized bill and compared the prices for each code to the fair prices - called billing to dispute the bill, but was told that billing only collects bills, I'd need to contact admin to dispute - bounced around a call center for hours trying to get someone who was actually qualified for bill disputes, and getting nowhere  - google and linkedin searched for the hospital board of directors and upper management  - got 30 emails of the most influential people at the hospital, plus the hospital's investors - every day would send a few emails, working my way up the chain, and writing an (increasingly long) email describing how they billed my client at 7 times over the fair price for services rendered, and how their billing department, customer service department, and the growing list of management I'd emailed, had failed to address the issue.  - escalated the emails until I was writing the director-level staff with the entire board of directors and a number of outside investors CC'd, asking for a written statement regarding their justification for billing at a rate 7 times higher than the national average, for commensurate services to what is available at other hospitals. And sternly laying out the failures to appropriately respond, at every level of the company.  Well, once I'd done all that (which was honestly only like 15 minutes a day) they reduced the bill... From $5000 to $26. Yep, twenty-six fuckin dollars.  Well, I told my boyfriend the good news, and he was at first overjoyed and blown away, like literally jumping up and down and hugging me and saying I was literally a Christmas miracle.  But then when he asked how I did it, I said it wasn't too hard, I just had to send a couple emails each day. He was curious what I'd said, and I handed him my phone.  He started to get stressed, and flipping back through other emails. Which there were like 60 of. He told me I went way too far, he was expecting me to dispute through their billing department or something normal and reasonable like that, not internet stalk every single manager and board member and investor and harass them into dropping the bill.  I was frustrated because I'd just saved us 5 grand, actually made it possible for us to afford a nice Christmas and save some money, and he was mad at me because I'd been a bit of a hardass?  I was furious, and he was also mad at me, saying he authorized me to dispute a bill, not basically threaten and harass a whole damn hospital for weeks.

He came home almost in tears from her chewing him out for behaving like a jackass in front of her family.  I heard him telling my wife about it and I laughed. She asked what was so funny and I reminded them both that I had tried dozens if not hundreds of times to teach him table manners and he rejected them and she protected him. I said that now he is a grown man and he had to learn the hard way.  They both think she overreacted and that I'm the asshole for being amused by his experience.",

        "selftext": "One of my (29M)  best friends \u201cCarla\u201d (31f) is getting married soon. It\u2019s only meant to be a small backyard type of wedding but they\u2019ve been planning it for a few months now and originally it was supposed to be on my property. They wanted it because it\u2019s private, has lots of open space for the reception, a nice view and the house could be used for them to get ready and stuff. Of course I said yes, she and her fianc\u00e9 \u201cRick\u201d were very happy. Thing is Carla and I do have a history. We went out on & off in college but decided to stay friends. Then I met my wife, we got married, Carla met Rick and now here they are. Now my wife knows I went out with Carla back in college and she didn\u2019t care. Carla still went to our wedding and everything. I never knew if Rick was told or not, it\u2019s not my relationship therefore not my business to say anything so I never did. Rick found out recently and not in the best way. Not sure how but from what I heard from friends is that one mutual friend told him (no idea why) we used to date. Not only that but apparently Carla said a couple years ago she was still in love with me when she was already dating Rick. Don\u2019t have actual confirmation if that\u2019s exactly what he was told. All Carla\u2019s told me is that Rick was told about our past and he\u2019s angry at her for never saying anything.  It became quite a drama and didnt hear from her for over a month until now. She told me they\u2019re going to couples counseling and that the wedding is still on. But Rick requested that I not attend. It sucks but I totally get why he wouldn\u2019t be comfortable. Then I asked the obvious question, where are they going to hold the wedding then? To my surprise she said they still want it at our place.  Rick said so to and in my mind I\u2019m going \u201che doesn\u2019t want the guy who dated his fianc\u00e9e  years ago at the wedding, but still wants the wedding at his house.\u201d My wife and I are expected to just...not be at our home that weekend, And I told Carla no. They\u2019re going to have to find some place else since we\u2019re not going to simply leave our home to them for the weekend. Not only for safety reasons but it just doesn\u2019t make sense. Rick doesn\u2019t want me around because he\u2019s not comfortable but is comfortable enough to have their wedding at my house? They really want their wedding here though and because of that I\u2019ve been bugged by not only her but also Rick and some friends who think I\u2019m being a petty asshole for not letting them have the wedding here anymore. Honestly don\u2019t think that I am, it just doesn\u2019t make sense at all to have to leave our own place for a wedding we\u2019re no longer welcome to and leaving our home totally vulnerable. Still, being accused of sabotaging their wedding and Rick believes it\u2019s the least I can do after everything. AITA?",

        "selftext": "I (19f) study drama at uni, and my boyfriend is on the same course. My boyfriend is a really good-looking guy, but he doesn't seem to know it. He gets a lot of attention from girls and for the most part, doesn't seem to get that they're flirting with him. I'm not generally annoyed by this, and never really say anything. However, there's one girl in our class, let's call her Victoria, who is obsessed with my boyfriend. She goes out of her way to be paired with him in group activities (for example, if the professor picks groups by numbering us 1, 2, 3, she will move herself to be in the same number as him) and she recently stepped down from a main role in a play we're doing so she could be in a more minor one, simply because this character has a romance with my boyfriend. I know this is the case, because I've heard her say to her friends that she thinks he's hot and what not. I've never said anything to her about it, because she seems pretty insecure (always complaining about how she thinks she's ugly) and I don't see it as a big deal because my boyfriend doesn't care. However, we recently performed the play and had a small afterparty where she got slightly drunk and was bragging about how she 'definitely felt something' when they kissed in the play and she's 'going to ask him if he felt the same'. I rolled my eyes and again ignored it, until she actually went up to my boyfriend. She was a little bit drunk, and when she went up to him I was there too. Victoria started saying that she knows he must have felt a spark, he's a really good kisser, etc. I snapped, and sort of shouted at her that 'you sound incredibly desperate, going after somebody else's boyfriend. You're pathetic if you think a stage kiss means you should be together.' She looked super embarrassed and walked away, and I later heard she'd gone home crying. I feel like a dick because she's obviously insecure and whatnot, and her friends haven't stopped calling me a bitch since. AITA? Edit: She 100% knows that I am his girlfriend, I have heard her talking about me being his girlfriend before.",

        "selftext": "Some backstory: I had been dating my ex fianc\u00e9 Sarah for four years. We had been planning to get married in November 2020 but I found out at the start of this month that she cheated on me. She begged me to give her another chance but I broke it off.  The problem was that being cheated on is, in my mind, completely emasculating and humiliating. So I never told anyone that was the reason we broke up. For obvious reasons, Sarah also didn\u2019t tell people we broke up because she cheated. So people have \u201cblamed\u201d me for the breakup, including my mom. They just see that I dumped her out of the blue.  I\u2019ve gone very strict no contact with Sarah after I discovered she was cheating on me. Sarah has been talking with my mom and has convinced her that if we could talk one more time, we would be able to reconcile. My mom has been applying hard core pressure on me to talk with Sarah but I\u2019ve explained that there\u2019s no chance we will ever get back together.  So tonight I go over to my mom\u2019s place because she\u2019s hosting family for Christmas Eve. I\u2019m there for a bit talking with my aunts and uncles and cousins when the doorbell rings and I can see it\u2019s Sarah. I ask wtf is going on and my mom says she invited Sarah so we can work this out in the spirit of the holidays.  I\u2019m pissed now because the only way to explain my side of the story is to tell everyone I was cheated on. Complete humiliation in front of my whole family. So as my mom goes to the front door, I go into the bathroom. My mom starts knocking on the door saying that I need to come out and talk to my ex like an adult. I say fuck it, kick out the window screen and get in my car and go home.  My mom called a short while ago saying she\u2019s cutting ties with me over my behavior (she\u2019s really fixated on me jumping out of a window) and that Sarah will always be like a child to her. My sister called me after to ream me out for ruining Christmas. I broke down and told her that Sarah cheated on me which is why I dumped her and didn\u2019t want to see her under any circumstances. She called me a big asshole who was lying to cover for myself.  Am I really in the wrong?",

He's willing to miss the dr appointment over soccer or a drink or board game with friends. His response is always I'm not the one carrying the baby, why do I have to go see the dr with you?. Last week was my final straw. He was supposed to come with me for the baby's gender reveal appointment but he chose to not come last minute because his friend invited him to fish 'n' chips meal. I was pretty livid but didn't make a fuss about it. Mom went with me instead.  He texted asking me to tell him the results (boy or girl) but I refused to tell him. He kept spam calling me but I hung up each time. He came home fuming demanding I tell him the results but I refused and bluntly told him, since he refused to attend the appointment then he gets no results til after the baby's born and said I was wiling to die on this hill. He went off calling me spiteful and immature for doing this and punishing him. He said he's the father and has the right to know. He then called me dramatic since I wasn't alone and mom was with me. I said he gets no results period. He's been fuming about it and told his family and they're now pressuring me to stop playing mind games with him and tell him but I declined.  AITA? EDIT/UPDATE: Hi, so, first of all, wow!!! I did not expect this to blow up. Sorry, can't answer any comments because of feeling overwhelmed...um I just wanted to mention that my husband just attempted to contact my dr to get the results. It didn't go well and we had another argument over it. He couldn't get it since his mom was the one who made the call.",

My brother 'Chris' (M) and his wife (F) have a 3 yro son who everyone calls miracle or rainbow baby. He came after several failed pregnancies that lasted for years.  When they found out that my nephew was included in the no children rule; they tried to convince me to make an exception for him. Chris told me his son is a miracle baby and his presence at the wedding will bring blessings for me and my fiancee. I refused and said no, the wedding is childfree. His wife kept sending my fiancee pics of my nephew when he was months old (what that mean??). I told them no, and to stop. My brother told me this might cause a rift in our relationship, I again said no and explained that the wedding is childfree. He asked again and pointed out how his baby is different since he's a rainbow, a miracle baby. I again said no and explained that the wedding is childfree. They brought it up when they visited at my home and I knew they weren't going to stop so I'd made flash cards in advance with the phrase the wedding is childfree, period and pulled them out and started slowly showing them the flash cards one by one in this order:  - The wedding (with a sticker of bride and groom).  - Is Child (with a sticker of a baby).  - FREEE (with a sticker of a \ud83d\udeab sign).  - PERIOD (with a huge, black dot sticker).  They both were stunned. I asked if they get it now and Chris had lost his shit. His wife had already grabbed her stuff and walked out. Chris called me an asshole for doing this and said that I disrespected him, his wife and their son who's my one and only nephew. He rushed out after we argued. My fiancee saw the whole thing and thought that it was funny but my parents and Chris are livid beyond measure. They're telling everyone about the amount of disrespect and mockery I had displayed towards them and I'm being told to fix it now.",

        "selftext": "Ok this is the worst. I\u2019m losing sleep over this. I\u2019m getting married in a week to an awesome woman, and I cannot wait to be her husband, we are so excited. My brother is gay, but my family doesn\u2019t know, only me and my parents know. I come from a very old school traditional family, so the old part of the family, grandparents and some aunts/uncles still have last century\u2019s mind, and the younger portion, cousins/sibilings are open minded, and are living in the present. So my brother has been dating his bf for 6 months now, the dude is great, I\u2019m so happy my brother found a great guy. But it\u2019s kind of a secret, as he hasn\u2019t told my family he is gay. I\u2019ve been telling him for years that he should come out, cause I know it stresses him a lot, and I think it will make him feel better not to hide anymore, plus I bet a few family members already know anyway. But he disagrees cause he knows a part of the family won\u2019t accept it and it will be a lot of drama. I see the opposite, I see it as the sooner you know who the idiots are, the sooner we can cut them from our lives. I have no interest in having someone in my life that doesn\u2019t accept my brother being gay. Anyway, that\u2019s his decision not mine, so for now he won\u2019t say anything. Until a few weeks ago, when he said he wants to bring his bf to my wedding. I was not expecting that to be honest. So he went from 0 to 100 pretty fast. If it was any other occasion I would be supportive obviously, but I don\u2019t think my wedding day is the day to do that.  Imagine all the drama and gossip and bullshit that would happen. And I don\u2019t want to get the attention away from my fianc\u00e9e, that\u2019s her day. And I dont wanna have to worry about that on my wedding day, and I think it\u2019s a pretty good reason I asked him why my wedding day, he said it\u2019s because he wants to celebrate love with the 2 people he loves the most, me and his boyfriend. This is killing me. I would fight my whole family for my brother and never speak to them again if I had to, but my wedding day is supposed to be a celebration, not a family fight, and I can\u2019t do this to my wife, that might ruin our future.  I didn\u2019t even tell her, she is already stressed out, dont wanna make it even worse With a heavy heart, I asked him to please come alone to the wedding, and that I hope he understands me. He  started crying and left my house without saying anything. Next day I got a text and he said \u201c dont worry, going alone\u201d. I tried calling him but he didnt answer  me, and my parents don\u2019t seem to know what\u2019s happening because they didn\u2019t say anything. He eventually called me back a few days later, we spoke, he said he understands my side, but things are still weird between us This is the worst situation of my life, am I the asshole for handling it the way I did? PS 1: I wanna thank the redittor that sent me a private message and said they hope a mass shooter shows up at my wedding, so thoughtful!!! PS 2: Thanks for the gold and stuff! Update: spoke to fianc\u00e9e, couldn\u2019t keep this from her anymore, she agreed with me. Clarification: I know it won\u2019t be my brother that would cause trouble. The trouble would start with remarks and looks from some aunt/uncle. Doesn\u2019t matter, we are spending a lot of money on this wedding, planned it for a long time, my fiancee put her heart and soul into planning this wedding.I don\u2019t want to see my bride or mom crying, or some idiot uncle insulting my brother. Literally every other day of my life I will support my brother\u2019s decision to come out. Even at the wedding, I would obviously defend him. But the point is, NOT AT THE WEDDING. Also, MY BROTHER IS NOT THE ASSHOLE. Not at all.",

It reached a really bad point where I passed out hit my head and my Dr admitted me to the hospital for a week.  When I got home my husband allowed his brothers family to move into 2 of our 3 bedrooms. (They were evicted i dont know why). One room was My office was tossed into our room papers every where. The house was a complete wreck. Trash, dirty clothes, used diapers. I started to cry. It was like a light flipped my husband was no longer the same.  My husband told me it wasn't that bad. My reply was fine then you should have the house cleaned up before I wake up. Completly exhaustedI fell asleep for 4 hrs. I woke up and went to get a drink of water. I couldn't every glass we own is scattered around the house. They didnt clean a single thing. I passive aggressively started to pick up the dirty dishes and washed them. The following morning. I was trying my best to work when their kids were crying non stop. Banging on the walls so on. Their mom was in her room for hours ignoring them.   When my husband came home. He was upset with me over how I didn't make his brother's wife feel welcome in our home. By helping with their kids when she was tired. Then continued to complain how nothing was done while he was at work all day in the house. Yep the same one he didn't clean. That lead to a fight where I told him. I am too sick to have company and they need to leave.  To which he replied they are his family and he won't kick them out. I started to cry again.  I was beyond frustrated, exhausted, I physically couldnt do it anymore. I called my mom asking if I could come stay with her. Telling her the whole story infront of my husband. Who at this point was completely shocked, Angry, also I could tell he wasnt sure what to do. My mom came with my brother's (I have 3 older brothers). My mom super angry told my husband. Since your family can stay so can we. My mom quickly took charge. I was sent to bed. My brother's started cleaning complaining loudly at how disgusting my BIL family is. Along with what a horrible husband my husband is for putting me through this while I am sick. I got a text message from my MIL for calling me an A for not helping my husband clean up the house and putting my BIL in a uncomfortable position by having my mom boss him around. Edited to add update, when my MIL showed up she was super angry outside. I could hear shouting but, couldn't understand what was said. Once inside she was shocked. My house looked really bad. My BIL lied to her about what happened. My MIL quickly started to help my mom in the bossing mode.My house is not just cleaned but deep cleaned. My BIL and his kids are now staying with MIL. She didn't know about the eviction. My in-laws helped them financially a couple of months ago. My MIL was not happy about it. SIL refused to come out of the bedroom. She would scream through the door but that was about it until her family came to pick her up. Last little bit. I did talk to my husband. He seemed very remorseful. I asked for some space he is staying at a hotel. He asked to come by and talk to me tonight.  My mom and dad are here. Both mom's felt like I should have someone here since I am sick.Both moms have set up a meal plan. Where they trade off who will bring in dinner. It was my MIL idea. Thank you for all your advice. I truly appreciate it. Talk with husband: summed up since it lasted 4 hrs.  it was a hard talk.  He is remorseful.Bil was only supposed to stay for a couple of nights. Then leave originally he thought they would be gone before I got home. He said he is tired and emotionally upset himself. When I originally passed out. My husband left to help a friend move. He came home and found me. He said he has no idea how long I was on the floor hurt. He was originally scared I had died.Since then he has had nightmares. On top of dealing with his family drama. He admitted to dumping his frustration onto me. When it's not my fault. He begged me for another chance. The next steps. We are still separated. He plans on staying at my brother house in his casita. We are going to go to marriage counseling and Individual counseling. He asked if he could come when the home health nurse comes each night and to my Dr's appointments. I agreed to that. Update on BIL: his wife admitted to having and affair. She told him she got married too soon and doesn't want the responsibilities of being a mom anymore. I am not sure what will happen with him and his kids but, I am shocked that she feels this way especially with her kids.",

        "selftext": "My dad passed away 2 weeks ago. Me, my wife 'Candace' and my daughter (16) 'Shiloh' and her stepsisters (19) & (17) flew to my hometown to attend the funeral. After that we got 2 hotel rooms (one for me and Candace, one for the girls). While I was in the room, I got a call from Shiloh at 11pm crying and sounded like she was arguing with her stepsisters. I asked what the matter was and she told me that her stepsisters insisted that she sleep on the floor (there were one large bed in the room and there was enough space for all 3 girls to sleep on). I asked why and she said she didn't know. I went to see what the issue was and talked with my stepdaughters about it. They kept talking but didn't really explain why they told her to sleep on the floor. They just shrugged and said It's better this way...we're more comfortable this way... I told Shiloh to grab her things and when one of my stepdaughters asked where we were going, I told her I was booking her a hotel room. Both looked upset but didn't say anything but they must've called their mom because she was awake when I got back and started arguing with me about giving Shiloh an entire hotel room for herself. I explained why I did it but she said I wasted money and that Shiloh could've sucked it up for one night on the floor. I called her unreasonable for saying this but she told me I showed the girls that I'm playing favorites and made my stepdaughters share a room while I gave my daughter and entire room for herself. We went home and Candace is still bringing it up saying I mishandled this. She even pointed out how my stepdaughters are upset since they're not speaking to me. ETA It was Candace who got a room for the 3 girls as to not stir any drama and save money. She was in charge of hotel reservation since I was emotionaly distressed. Also. Candace did NOT expect Shiloh to sleep on the floor. She wanted all 3 girls to share the bed.  ETA#2 For those that are calling me an ah for giving my daughter her name. Her mom did that and she's deceased so please let's not focus on that. And also, I've known my stepdaughters since they were little. We're pretty much family and Candace is a sahm but I give her full access to my money since this stuff was already discussed before handed. Pretty much everything was.",

        "selftext": " I (M/37) have a 13 y.o son. I was a widower when I met my now wife. She has a 16 y.o daughter from another relationship. The family is often on pretty good terms. My son is the quiet one in the house, he keeps to himself a lot but not to the point of being concerning. My wife and stepdaughter are the complete opposit. They both encourage him to be outgoing and share activities and join gatherings with extended family. My son complained about having to be forced out of his comfort zone and having his need for space invalidated. I spoke to both my wife and stepdaughter and asked them to give him space and freedom to spend his time however he wanted. they apologized and promised to let him be. As mother's day was approaching I wanted to throw my wife a surprise mother's day celebration. It was no longer a surprise because my stepdaughter gave her the heads so she could prepare. Yesterday I got off work earlier than usual to get final arrangements done (we planned to celebrate at the restaurant and invited her family there) I had the key and while I was entering the house through the front door I overheard my wife and stepdaughter talking to my son. My wife was asking my son if he could convince me to let him stay home and not go with them to the restaurant to celebrate. I paused and decided to keep listening. My son said why and she told him that his introverted and socially inept attitude will make her family uncomfortable and will ruin the mood. He promised her that he'd be well behaved and would try to interact and socialize with everyone but she said that she wasn't buying it. He kept reassuring her but she snapped and told him that technically, she's not his mom so she didn't get why he wanted to celebrate mother's day with her so badly. My stepdaughter threw some (I don't remember) backhanded comment and then both of them were shocked to see me standing there. Both were staring without saying anything. I told my son and his stepsister to go to their rooms then told my wife that the celebration was off, cancelled. she tried to argue asking why repeatedly and I told her why. She tried to explain that she didn't mean it like that and that I only heard part of the conversation but not all of it. I told her I was done arguing and the decision was already made. She yelled asking what she was going to tell her family and said that I was making tremendous mistake towards her. I ignored her while she kept throwing tantrum after a tantrum. Early this morning she took my stepdaughter and went to stay with her folks. not a single call or text from her so far. Situation is full of tension. I'm upset still but more hurt to be honest. I mean yes I did say I was going to havw this celebration but I thought that what she said to my son was too harsh to ignore.",

        "selftext": "I've been married to my wife Beth for 5 years. I have a bio daughter named Jessica (she's 18). And I also have two stepdaughters named Monica and Leah. They're 25 & 28. Both are single moms and live with us currently. there's been issues about my stepdaughters asking my daughter to babysit the kids. Jessica didn't have a problem with it at first since this is what she does to earn money but since her stepsisters don't pay her much, she'd just refuse to babysit. We worked this out by having my wife take care of paying for the babysitting. I planned a family vacation for 3 days and everyone wanted to go. However, Both Monica & Leah suggested that Jessica stay home and watch the kids since Beth doesn't want her grandkids to come. They said it's because the kids are used to Jessica and hiring another babysitter would cause issues. And also said that Jessica isn't too fond of our destination but it was obvious that Jessica wanted to go. They insisted and Beth offered to pay her double and there was just..a lot of back and forth on this til I demanded they stop bringing it up. We were supposed to go last week but when everybody had bagged their bags and was time to go, Jessica found out that she didn't have her passport on her. We searched her bag then went home and searched there. Beth and my stepdaughters kept insisting that we go back to the airport or else we'd miss our flight. They insisted that Jessica stay at home with the kids. They even told the new babysitter to go home cause she was no longer needed. I refused to go and kept searching for the passport til Monica admitted that she helped Leah hide Jessica's passport to get her to stay home with the kids. I was livid I tried to get her to tell me where it was but she said Leah had it, Leah denied so I threatened to cancel the vacation that's when they gave it back. I decided to actually cancel the vacation and blew up at both of them and berated them. They stayed upstairs for a while and Beth refused to speak to me and said that I punished my stepdaughters for worrying about their kids and wanting them to stay with someone they know. I got told I overreacted and ruined the trip for everybody. Editing to mention that kicking my stepdaughters out isn't possible since my wife co-owns the house that we currently live in.",

        "selftext": "I wanna preface this by saying that I f34 married my husband m37 a year ago. His mom is snoopy and annoying af. She can't help it that is just how she is as my dear in laws say. My husband and I purchased a new house recently. My MIL kept pushing to get an emergency key, She promised that she only use it in an emergency but giving the fact that she had an emergency key to our old apartment and walked in on us being intimate twice (but my husband didn't think it was big deal) I just couldn't trust her so I just sent her a fake key (after she kept pushing) and she had a smug on her face after I hand delivered it to her. Days gone by and on Christmas dinner MIL angerily called me out on the fact I gave her a fake copy of the house key. She shamed me for doing this in front of everyone but in my defensive I asked her how she found out and she said days ago when she came over at 4 while my husband and were out. I reminded her didn't you promise you wouldn't use it unless there's an emergency? So You tried to get in when there was no emergency and you broke the promise you made to us! She looked red in the face and the other family started staring and some even laughed at her for the face she made. She suddenly got up from her seat and rushed into the kitchen where she had a huge meltdown so loud the next door neighbors must've heard - literally I've never heard a 60+ year old woman throw a tantrum like that. Needless to say dinner went awkward and my husband and his sister were giving me looks. My husband went off on me in the car and said I lied and manipulated and humiliated and exposed his mom and said he wouldn't have let me get away with it had he known. We had an argument and he is demanding I apologize to his mom for my childish behavior and for ruining Christmas dinner for the whole family. AITA? Eta so this went off unexpectedly and I thought I'd show my husband some pretty helpful comments I found here minutes ago but he got mad at me when he saw it and said I was nuts to talk about his family online. He demanded my phone so he could delete it but I refused and I went upstairs and into the bedroom. I never seen him so agitated and I didn't think he'd react like that honestly. But thank you guys for your support. It really means so much. I'll update if I can. Thanks again :)",

He\u2019s been with this girl for six months and throughout the time we have gotten close because we both like hair, makeup, and shopping. I never knew there was anything wrong with their relationship except when she texted me last week I saying she would love to hang out but thinks it\u2019ll be inappropriate because her and my brother broke up. I asked her why and she said she was sick and tired of \u201cauditioning\u201d to prove she was with him for the right reasons. She went on to say that my brother is paranoid she\u2019s after his money so he would test her like 1. Leaving out his bank statements on their bed and getting upset when she picked it up 2. Going out to eat at high end restaurants he requested and leaving his wallet on home at purpose to make her pay the bill and prove she\u2019s not going out with him for money 3. Never buying her gifts and questioning her when she asks why he doesn\u2019t.   I was shocked so I had to hear my brothers perspective. We spoke and he told me everything she said was true and that there\u2019s nothing wrong with making sure his girlfriend is with him for the right reasons. He said he left his bank statements on the bed and was peeking through the door to see if she would be curious and when he saw her pick up the papers he knew in his gut she was using him for his money, so he set up the restaurant idea to see if she would get upset at paying a 500$ bill which she was. I asked him if he thinks her being an elementary school teacher could\u2019ve contributed to her being upset at a 500$ bill at a restaurant he wanted to go to and he said no. He said the straw that broke was when she asked him why he hasn\u2019t bought her a single gift since they\u2019ve started dating when she bought him a gaming console and new rims for his car and he knew she was just discretely asking him to buy her an expensive gift.  He confronted her and said he thinks she\u2019s with him for his money so she said let me do us both a favor and dumped him and blocked him. He\u2019s upset about the \u201cgold digging bitch\u201d and when I laughed he called me an asshole. He said I would never understand what\u2019s it\u2019s like being a rich man and being used and I get that concern, but I told him if he thinks any woman will be okay with his tests and auditions he\u2019s delusional as hell. If he doesn\u2019t want to be used for his money he should start dating people as wealthy as him or leave lower income people alone if he\u2019s not going to be genuine in his relationships unless they pass his \u201ctest\u201d.",

She remarried when he was 14. I did when he was 16.  I had an RESP set up for him. That's a education fund in Canada. As long as he went for post secondary education he could use the money for anything.  I always told him that I was okay with him not going to university. That way I could use the money I had saved up for him to go to Belgium and buy some beer from monks that only allow you to buy one case. He knew I was joking and he always played along. He wouldn't let me get his goat.  When he got accepted to McGill it was the proudest moment of my life. I took him out for a beer to celebrate his achievement and mourn the loss of my trip to Europe.  My son was struck and killed by a drunk driver in March. I'm dealing with it.

I said I was not going to do that. I was going to go drink beer in my son's honour.  She says I'm wasting thousands of dollars. And I guess I am.

        "selftext": "**UPDATED 7:50 PM:** Holy crap! Thank you for the outpour of support, everyone. I never thought posting this in an online community was going to reach the right eyes so quickly! I had written this on my lunch break and was completely blown away and brought to tears when I checked back in after work. Several people reached out with helpful resources, including a litigator on Reddit who put me in contact with a colleague who practices in my state. Apparently there is precedent and people have won against the state although it did take several years.  My intent was to answer more questions since I wasn't able to do that while at work. I was also going to post the website as that has been a popular request, however I've been told not to continue further discussions beyond what I have already posted if I wish to pursue a civil suit.  Just a couple things I want to address in my update here. Some people are saying I'm leaving out details. My original post was much longer but there's a 3000 character limit imposed. I had to delete a lot of things from my initial draft so I apologize if it looks like details have been left out. I did try to make sure everything that was relevant was kept. Lastly, my son is now back with me. There was a lot of paperwork and even a court hearing, but we're together now and that's what counts.  I'm sorry if I didn't respond to your comment or private message. I'm still going through my unread messages and still have quite a lot left to read. Truly, thank you from the bottom of my heart for your support, words of encouragement, and advice that you sent my way. I can't even begin to put into words how grateful I am. Again, thank you so much to all the kind strangers who went out of their way to help.  ---------------------------------------------  Back in November 2018 I was arrested at work in front of my boss and co-workers. It was the most humiliating thing I've ever experienced. I later learned at the police station that I was being charged with multiple felonies. This came as a huge surprise. Luckily I was able to keep my wits and lawyer up instead of speaking with the detective. For $13,000 which completely wiped my savings, I was able to retain a criminal defense attorney. However it cost me everything and I was unable to pay my bond. This resulted in me staying in jail for a total of 54 days. At a status hearing, my attorney presented video evidence of me gassing up my car 3 hours away from where the crimes took place and I ended up having all my charges dismissed. When I finally got out I learned that I had lost my job, was in the process of being evicted, and my son was in the state's care. His mother is a heroine addict and I haven't spoken to my own parents in nearly 15 years. They wouldn't let him go to my girlfriend because they didn't consider her family.  Since my release, I've learned that I can't sue the police and no one gives a shit that I was locked up for 54 days because the detective did poor investigation work. I've gone to the local press about this and was told that what happened to me happens quite a bit. They took down my info but never followed up. So what I did was create a website sharing my story. I also uploaded the police report and some other documents from the discovery. Literally the only reason why I was arrested was because an eye witness said they saw me. If the detective had done his job, he could have verified that I wasn't even in town on the day the crimes took place. This is what pisses me off the most. My life was ruined because of a lazy employee.  I'm writing this now because my website is now ranked #2 on the first page of search results when you type in my town's name. I live in a touristy town and we attract a lot of visitors over the summer. My web traffic has more than quadrupled, and apparently it's gotten someone high up's attention. I received a cease and desist letter recently, which I showed to my attorney. He said sharing my experience online isn't illegal and that everything I had stated was a fact or my own opinion, protecting me from a defamation lawsuit. Yesterday I received a visit from two officers and the detective who had arrested me. He apologized, stating mistakes can happen. They then talked to me about my website and asked if I could remove it. I said I would delete it on the condition that the detective leave his job and never do police work again. Suffice to say that isn't happening.  After the visit I received, I'm more pissed off that the only reason the detective apologized to me was to get me to take down my website. I don't plan to and the only one supporting this is my girlfriend. My friends think I'm being spiteful and have suggested that I just delete it. AITA for keeping my website up? Edit: Grammar",

We pay the taxes and services / maintenance on the house, our son pays for his groceries and the house utilities. All was going well for a few years, our son meets a girl and they get serious. We met her and she seems nice enough.  The announce their engagement and she moves into the house with our son.   Now for the problem: The wedding !!!

We all seem to be getting along well, my wife, daughter and the fianc\u00e9 go into the house along with her mother an sisters and my son.  A few minutes later my wife and daughter come out and are really upset. The come over and tell me we're leaving and driving back to NJ.  I try to find out what happened.  Once we get back to NJ and they calmed down they tell me that our son and his fianc\u00e9 along with her family don't want us at the wedding.  According to what I was told We're not their kind of people.  I was livid, I called my son and asked him WTH this was about.  He tells me that her family feel that we are not good enough and will embarrass them at a family wedding and that we are all uninvited from the wedding.   I let a week go by to calm myself down and drive back to the PA house, the new future in-laws are in the house along with the fianc\u00e9.  It appears that they all moved into the house They ask me why I'm there, I tell them that since we aren't invited to the wedding, I was coming over to talk to my son.  They tell me to leave their house.  I lost it, and told them that they had 30 days to get out.  Tell my son I'm selling the house and he could find somewhere else to live with all of you.  I go to a realtor in town and list the house for sale.  They call my son at work and tell him what I said.  Apparently they thought that he owned the house. He calls me and asks why I'm selling his house, I tell him I paid for it along with the taxes on it and it is mine.  He was living there rent free, but since he doesn't want us in his new life, he has to get out.  I tell him the same as I told his future in-laws they have 30 days to get out then I'll get a lawyer and get them evicted.  Am I the AH for taking a hard stance on this.  He is my son but thein-laws seem to take over and we no longer count.",

        "selftext": "I am the  by-product of my parents extra-marital affair. Both of them had spouses at the time. My birth-mother got pregnant and had to tell her husband as he was overseas when I was conceived so there was no way I was his. A few months after I was born they decided not to divorce. I was given to my grandparents on my mothers side to raise with my birth father secretly paying child support without his wife's knowledge.\r\rBoth my parents had other children, my dad's side knows nothing about me but my siblings on my mum's side were told that I am adopted by my grandparents. Recently I decided that I wanted to know more about my dad's family and I sent a friend's request to one of my siblings and my dad so I could get to know him. Well he freaked out and contacted my birth mum and they asked to speak to me over Skype. They both told me that they couldnt risk staying in contact with me and told me that they were going no-contact and to please respect it and move on with my life. \r\rWell I did pretty much the opposite. I contacted my dad's wife and shared screen shots of our conversations and told her everything. She is now divorcing him while on my mother's side I told both my siblings who then went on to tell extended family including her husband's side so now they are seperated and my siblings hate my mother. \r\rCurrently my siblings on both sides lives have been upturned and after the satisfaction has worn off I feel like I unnecessarily hurt them through my parents.

        "selftext": "I (37M) have three girls; 8, 10, and 12. Their mother walked out on us for another man when our youngest was around 4. My ex still stays in contact, though, and pays child support. A few weeks ago while doing laundry, I saw red spots on my oldest's underwear. I asked her if she knew about it, and she cried and told me she tried to call her mom, but my ex didn't call back. She'd been stuffing toilet paper in her underwear, hoping that would work. I explained to her that periods are nothing to be ashamed of, and found some great resources online for us to review together. I took her to the store to pick out brands of feminine products she wanted to use (she picked Playtex Sport because she's a gymnast).  After we were done, I decided I should do the same thing with my other two. My 12yo volunteered to be part of preparing them, and we made a whole night of it; it was wonderful, and I learned a lot. I even learned what a menstrual cup is, and how they benefit the environment. The other day, my ex called back. I'll usually arrange a video chat and leave the room so they can have some alone time, and when they're done chatting, I'll come back in to talk boring co-parenting stuff like school, bills, etc. This last time, my ex was FURIOUS with me for talking about periods with the girls. She shouted at me that I was sick and perverted, why didn't I call her myself if I knew it was so urgent, I could've called one of their grandmas/aunts, but my mom has dementia, while her mom and sisters call me a loser because I teach kindergarten, so I'm not fond of them. My ex told me I was being immature and should have just toughed it out for the girls. This really pissed me off, so I shouted back that maybe if she wasn't such a deadbeat and answered her goddamned phone once in a while, she could have handled this. I brought up everything she does that hurts them; she hasn't been to a single soccer game, piano recital, or gymnastics meet in two years, every other weekend when they come home from her house, they go straight to their rooms, only to emerge hours later asking me why she loves her new husband more than them, and what did they do to make her leave. My ex responded by saying I should tell them it's not their fault I couldn't satisfy her, and I screamed fuck you, and she just smirked and pointed behind me, saying Look what you did When I turned around, my 8yo and 10yo were standing in the doorway crying. It broke my heart; I never shout, so I know I scared them. My 12yo stormed in and started screaming at her mom, and while I appreciate her sticking up for me, this is not a battle I want her fighting. My ex hung up before I could fully deescalate the situation, and let's just say the girls have been given free reign of the ice cream and limitless hours of video games, because I feel so bad. I even watched all the Twilight movies with them, so don't say I don't love them. But in this instance, AITA for shouting?",

        "selftext": "I'm not really a photographer, I'm a dog groomer. I take lots of photos of dogs all day to put on my Facebook and Instagram, it's my thing if that makes sense. A cut and a photo with every appointment. I very seldom shoot things other than dogs even if I have a nice set up. A friend got married a few days ago and wanting to save money, asked if I'd shoot it for them. I told him it's not really my forte but he convinced me by saying he didn't care if they were perfect: they were on a shoestring budget and I agreed to shoot it for $250, which is nothing for a 10 hour event.  On the day of, I'm driving around following the bride as she goes from appointment to appointment before the ceremony, taking photos along the way. I shoot the ceremony itself, and during the reception I'm shooting speeches and people mingling. I started around 11am and was due to finish around 7:30pm. Around 5pm, food is being served and I was told I cannot stop to eat because I need to be photographer; in fact, they didn't save me a spot at any table. I'm getting tired and at this point kinda regretting doing this for next to nothing. It's also unbelievably hot: the venue is in an old veteran's legion and it's like 110F and there's no AC. I told the groom I need to take off for 20min to get something to eat and drink. There's no open bar or anything, I can't even get water and my two water bottles are long empty. He tells me I need to either be photographer, or leave without pay. With the heat, being hungry, being generally annoyed at the circumstances, I asked if he was sure, and he said yes, so I deleted all the photos I took in front of him and took off saying I'm not his photographer anymore. If I was to be paid $250, honestly at that point I would have paid $250 just for a glass of cold water and somewhere to sit for 5min. Was I the asshole? They went right on their honeymoon and they've all been off of social media, but a lot of people have been posting on their wall asking about photos with zero responses.",

        "selftext": "I'm a software engineer, with a full time job and a side hustle of doing freelance coding work in my own time. I've always been the type to have a side hustle I put a lot of my free time into; I get really bored sitting idle. My freelance hourly rates are $60 an hour, and at my full time job, my hourly pay works out to about $40 an hour. So that's how I value my time.  Anyway, over Christmas vacation, I was staying at my parents house. My cousin was also staying over with her three young kids from Christmas to new year's. I'd been planning on doing some work on my freelance projects when I had free time; in the mornings when my family had no plans. I wasn't in any rush; I was already ahead of schedule on them all, but I didn't really have anything else to do. It was in a really rural area and it's like an hour drive to the nearest anything Then my cousin and her husband asked if I could babysit all day for three days, so they could visit some friends in the area and hang out with just adults. I said I had planned on doing freelance work at the library, and she offered to pay me to babysit. I said I could if they got close to my freelance rates. She wanted a number, and although my freelance rates are $60 I didn't feel like that was right, it was high. But I didn't want to go too low; honestly babysitting 3 kids would be harder for me than the routine coding work I had for my freelance project. I don't know a lot about kids and I've never babysat for long, and I had a feeling it would be stressful and difficult. So I said $35, which is below what I make hourly at work, and what is the bare minimum I'd value my time for, if that time is spent doing difficult work.  And she went crazy at me, saying that's a ridiculous rate for babysitting, that I was entitled and being selfish, that I'm trying to take advantage of how she didn't have other options, etc. I said that's way below what I'd be making if I had the time to do my own work, and I'd be putting off my own work to babysit.  Her husband then got mad at me saying that I was a 24 year old girl, that I'm damn near a child myself, that my time is not worth that much and it's childish to say that it was. And that I was a stupid girl for not knowing that babysitting costs like 15 an hour, when I grew up and have kids of my own I will see how stupid I was being. I was kind of done with being called stupid so I just told them I hoped they could find someone else. My mom thinks that I asked for something offensive, and my cousin and her husband obviously did too. AITA for giving that number?",

        "selftext": "**ETA**: There may have been some confusion as to my gf's reaction, she was ashamed her family dug so deep into me, not about my response. After wanting to die for the next 48 hours she agreed I did the right thing and that it was funny Backstory: due to my dad's job we lived in Italy for 3 years when I was younger, so I speak Italian almost fluently (it's been awhile, so I've lost some of it)  Recently I started dating a girl. She's great and I love her so much. I met her family a few nights ago for dinner. She warned me that the male side of her family is very big into being macho, into testing the boys the women date and are VERY big on taking pride in their Italian ancestry. I think besides the grandfather, however, they were almost all born in Bergen County, NJ but whatever, its nice to take pride in ones heritage.  Long story short at dinner they kept making jokes at my expense (I honestly would not call it bullying, just things about my height, beard, shaved head). They tried making fun of my IT job too but stopped once I told them my income. It was overall not a bad experience, but a not so pleasant one. Anyways, her older brother kept pushing things, giving me exceptional amounts of shit for playing Lacrosse in HS (apparently its a sport for prissy rich kids and not manly like football or baseball). He ended his rant by saying hey, we're just a big Italian family, we're loud and tell it how we see it! Hahaha! and all the family except my girlfriend laughed. So I, for the next minute, responded to everything they said in Italian. My girlfriend buried her head in shame, the grandfather laughed and everyone else kept looking at each other confused before telling me they didn't speak Italian. I replied then don't use your Italian heritage as an excuse to behave poorly when you can't even speak the language. They got mad, but the grandfather told them all I was right and to be quiet.  My girlfriend isn't mad, just ashamed, I think the grandfather likes me, but word from my gf's sister is that all the men are furious, think I'm a smart ass and that I disrespected them and their masculinity in an unforgiveable way.

He convinced her to be a stay at home mom and sell her business by telling her how good of a childhood he had and how happy my marriage was without telling her (which I today found out) that our arrangement was everything everything before 9am andAfter 5pm was split 50/50, Sunday was my day off and I was brought out twice a week.  On to the story- on my last visit I noticed my daughter in law was  struggling mentally so I,my sister(55f) and her girlfriend (53) pulled our money together and paid for a spa weekend for them while we\u2019d babysit the kids for her birthday last weekend.  I was preparing on Thursday evening  for the kids to arrive when my dil rang me holding back tears saying they\u2019d won\u2019t be going because my sons friend came to town and he said he wanted to spend the weekend with his friends catching up. I pressed her a little and I\u2019m talking a little about her situation , she came clean about him doing no chores,no date nights and her basically doing all of the child care because \u201cthat\u2019s what stay at home moms do\u201d I was honestly disgusted. I convinced her to drop me off the kids and bring a friend to the spa I even dipped into my savings to give her \u20ac500 to buy herself something nice. When she dropped me off the kids I begged her to tell me were son was after 5 minutes she told me the bar. She left for the spa while I left for the bar (she knew I was going there and knew my sister/my sister in law were taking care of the kids)  Here\u2019s were I might be the asshole I when to the bar were he and his friends were, I sat down next to the Group and asked my son \u201cdid i fail you as a mother or was it your father because we both thought your partner comes before your silly drunk friends\u201d the post is getting long enough but long story short I humiliated him and got myself banned from a bar  My dil said she will taking the kids to her parents when she gets back tomorrow and my son is calling me an asshole for humiliating him/ sticking my nose in his marriage Maybe I should have stayed out i don\u2019t know Edit I just wanted to say I\u2019m heartbroken not by any judgement towards me or my parenting skills but the fact a lot of people are shocked I\u2019m care about my daughter in laws mental health and stood up for her against my sons bad  behaviour I just want to say as a mother my advice is Treat your daughter/son/non-binary in laws how you\u2019d want YOUR children to treated.

        "selftext": "My (27F) older brother and SIL (both mid 30's) just welcomed their first child a year and a half ago, after YEARS of trying. After many failed attempts, SIL was told that she wouldn't be able to conceive due to a medical condition she has, they finally got pregnant.  Since having my niece, the baby has been the center of attention at EVERY family even we've had since she was born. Birthday's, wedding's, family get togethers, you name it. Now don't get me wrong I LOVE my niece, but it can get to be a little too much when my SIL goes on and on about how long they tried to conceive, complications they've had, miscarriages they've had etc. Like a little TOO much info. Many family members have commented on how it's a little bit excessive, but no one has said anything because they don't want to sound like an AH.  Anyway I'm getting married in the spring and my brother and SIL approached me last weekend about having my niece be the flower girl. Now my fianc\u00e9 (35M) has two children (10M and 6F) from his previous marriage. His son is one of his groomsmen while his daughter had asked to be our flower girl when we told them the news that we were getting married a year ago, as it's something she always wanted to do, so of course we said yes.  So I explained this to my SIL when she asked me about my niece. She asked if my step daughter can just carry my niece with her? I said I don't think she'd be comfortable with that considering she's 6. She then asked why I can't give that role to my niece, and allow herself to carry my niece down as the flower girl? I said no because I already promised my step  daughter. She then starting going off about how my lack of effort to incorporate my niece is disgusting to her. I should honor her in some way since I know how long and hard they tried for my niece.  Now I may sound like an AH for this but I kind of got fed up and snapped and said  Incorporate my niece how? By the time the wedding comes around she'll be 2 years old. The ENTIRE family already knows your story about how long and hard you guys tried for her. What more do you expect me to do to honor her? She started crying and said that clearly I don't love my one and only niece and I'm letting her down. I said of course I love my niece, and obviously she's going to be involved in pictures and stuff. But I'm not going to let my step daughter down by giving my niece a role she's too young to remember anyway.  Well now SIL and my brother are pissed off with me for not letting my niece be flower girl, and are running around telling the rest of the family I don't love my niece. My mom had been trying to stay neutral but thinks my step daughter would understand if I explained to her I need to give that role to my niece. I'm firm in my decision though, and my fianc\u00e9 is thankful that I didn't let his daughter down. AITA for not allowing my niece to be the flower girl?",

        "selftext": "So my friend 20f and I 19m have been friends for a few years and she recently got engaged. A week ago I got a dm from her for a small costume party she was hosting as a celebration for her getting engaged. I asked if there was a theme and she said there wasn\u2019t. I\u2019m a cosplayer so I had a lot of choices. I didn\u2019t want to rock up in an anime cosplay, so I thought it would be funny to go to an engagement party as the Corpse Bride. I arrived at her house yesterday and everything seemed normal. A few people complemented my costume and I was having a lot of fun. After ten minutes my friend\u2019s fianc\u00e9 walked out in a black tuxedo and announced this was actually their wedding. Apparently my friend saw a video of someone doing this and wanted to do the same. He asked us all to go to the back yard for the ceremony to begin. I went straight to him. I asked him if I should quickly go home and change my outfit and that I would get back before it started. He told me it was fine since I didn\u2019t know this was the wedding. I trusted him and followed everyone outside. They got married and everything seemed good. The reception was just in their house again so everyone just walked back inside and picked up where they left off. I tried talking to my friend and celebrating with her but she kept making excuses to not talk to me. I assumed it was just because she was tried from the big day and wanted some alone time. I didn\u2019t bother her after that and the party soon ended. I got home and half an hour passed when my phone started getting notifications. I checked and it was my friend texting me. She was cussing me out and telling me how I ruined her wedding. I was really confused and asked what I did. That only made her more angry. She told me it was basic knowledge not to wear a wedding dress to a wedding. I reminded her I had no idea it was a wedding and that I asked her now husband if I should change and he said it was fine. She didn\u2019t respond, but I got a text from her husband. He asked why I would tell her he said it was fine. I told him he said it was fine. Then he said how I should have changed anyways and it\u2019s my fault that the two are now fighting over this. I\u2019ve tried texting her that I wad sorry and if I had known I wouldn\u2019t have done it. I woke up today and saw her and her husband have blocked me on everything. So, AITA for not changing out of the wedding dress when I found out it was actually a wedding? Edit: I am a guy. I cosplayed the character Emily from The Corpse Bride and had blue paint all over. I\u2019m also Australian and I\u2019ve never heard a costume party meaning fancy.

        "selftext": "This happened just a few hours ago. I am a 19 year old man and the people calling me an asshole are 18 year old men and women.  On Thursday, a person I had a major crush on in high school (but who rejected me) messaged me out of the blue. She had never contacted me without my contacting her first, and at one point I realized she had had me blocked on social media, and so I found it odd that she was suddenly being friendly. After sending a couple of greetings/questions about how I've been, she said that she was going to have some people over and wanted to know if I would get the beer. The drinking age where we are is 19, and she and the people who were going to chill were all 18. The liquor stores in my area all card. I thought it was silly that my being a month older meant I could buy liquor and they couldn't, and so I said I would love to go. She said thanks, I'll pick you up at seven! 7 o'clock rolled around, and she texted me to say she was in front of my house. I went out dressed and ready to chill with some people, and she drove me to the liquor store. When we got there, I asked what beer she wanted me to get, and she told me to get Budweiser. I hid my disappointment as well as I could, but it was her party so I went in and bought two cases of 24.  I got back in the car and said let's party, and she was eerily quiet. I noticed that she wasn't driving towards her neighborhood, but rather back towards mine. I thought she had moved or something, but didn't want to press the issue. When she turned down my street I finally figured it out. She was being purposefully vague about the invitation because she wanted me to get the beer, but she wanted a way out when she told me I wasn't actually invited in the first place. She stopped in front of my house, leaned over, kissed me on the cheek, and said thanks! in her best voice. I deadpanned her and asked when she was going to tell me I wasn't invited. She feigned surprise and said that she never intended to invite me in the first place. I sat in silence for a long awkward minute, picked up the beer, and walked towards my front door. She got out of her car and frantically tried to reinvite me to the party, but I told her that what she did was the most humiliating thing that ever happened to me. I opened my front door, slammed it a bit too hard, and came back to my room. Now I'm sitting here drinking absolutely unpalatable piss water, and I have text messages from all of her friends and her asking me why I'm being such a dick. I don't think I'm the asshole for reacting the way I did, but if you haven't figured it out I'm not amazing socially so I'm not sure. Am I here?",

        "selftext": "This whole saga started because my husband took my last name. A couple weeks ago he got his workplace to change it, and his coworkers found out. About half of them think this is the funniest thing ever and about half are deeply offended. Brenda is in the offended half, and has made that clear.  He and I are in a group chat with his coworkers where we organize carpooling during the pandemic. It is very helpful to us, so we can't leave the chat. Since he changed his name, my husband and I have been dealing with a lot of dumb jokes in the chat, which we have been mostly ignoring.  Yesterday Brenda, his coworker and I got into a bit of a spat. I messaged the group asking if someone could take my husband home since I wouldn't be back from work until late and needed the car. One of his other coworkers agreed, and I thought that was that.  Brenda messages the group saying maybe if you spent less time at work and more time being a wife, your husband wouldn't come into work with dirty shirts I took this as a bad joke initially. My husband is a rural mail carrier, so his shirts look like shirts worn by someone in 90 degree heat on dusty roads. I do wash them, but there's only so much to be done.  Me: I could make cleaning those shirts my full-time job and it wouldn't do much lol Brenda: you won't be married very long if you keep trying to be the man in the relationship. I'd be embarrassed as a wife if I did so little for my husband Me: well I work more hours and pay the bills, so I think he can oxyclean his own shirts if it's so important Brenda: maybe you should learn to take proper care of your husband or you'll find yourself divorced.  Me: I'll let you know when I need relationship advice from someone who is 42 and single Now apparently Brenda is going around and saying that I mocked her for being single in her 40s. I don't care if someone is single in their 40s, but I think it's absolute bullshit that she can call me a bad wife but I can't point out she has no frame of reference.  AITA reddit? Edit: people keep asking why I need to help arrange rides in the first place. When my husband is out on deliveries he rarely has cell service, so if I find out late that I'm going to be home late I need to be able to reach his coworkers directly. Multiple spouses are in the chat for the same reasons. Edit 2: people are saying that I've hurt my husband's feelings by saying I pay the bills. After reading the exchange he sent me a text saying sometimes I forget you're a hard little bitch who takes no prisoners. I'm so proud lol.  He's fine, I asked him just now if my comment about the bills hurt him and he said oh yeah, it's so hard having a hot wife who makes good money. Really tough, pray for me.",

        "selftext": "I (40m) have a sister (30f) who is getting married in a week. The groom proposed to her a year ago at a family dinner that left everyone speechless, but very happy for them as they are longtime companions. During this dinner, my sister asked my son (17m) to make her wedding dress. My son has always loved design and fashion, he took technical courses in these areas and sewing, and even his friends keep asking for his clothes because they are so beautiful. He agreed, but said that he needed time and that he would need her opinion constantly.  At first my sister was very annoying. My son drew about 50 dress designs in a month and she only liked one, which he continued with. He sewed it with great quality fabric which I paid for as I wanted to get involved in a certain way. For five months he made several adjustments to suit her wishes, as she always complained about something. After a while, he arrived at the final model and it was just amazing. My mother cried seeing my sister in the dress and I confess that I almost got emotional too.  The problem was that last week my son came to talk to me about the wedding invitation that had not arrived for him, but for other family members. I thought maybe he didn't need one, but it still felt weird. I messaged my sister raising this issue and she replied that she didn't want any underage people at her wedding because there would be alcohol. I asked if she was going to make an exception for my son, but she cut me off and said no.  There are no children in our family, my son is the only minor, so I didn't see any sense in this rule for family members. And to make matters worse, my son was very sad and cried because he spent months on this dress and couldn't go to the wedding. I was very upset and told my sister that she should look for another dress as soon as possible, as she would no longer wear the one my son made.  She called and yelled at me, saying I was being unreasonable and that I couldn't do this. My mother called me saying I should deliver the dress and follow the rules, but I didn't and hung up on her. Because of this, the family is divided. Many agree with me and condemn my sister's action saying she could only make an exception, but another part says I'm unreasonable and I'm spoiling her big day.  I don't think I'm being wrong but just rational and paying her back in kind. So AITA? UPDATE:  first I would like to thank all the comments and suggestions, I really didn't expect my post to resonate so much.  I talked to my son about the suggestions you guys gave me and he agreed to sell the dress at market price. He calculated the price of everything and the value was quite high. We sent the proposal to my sister and she hated it. She said she couldn't afford it because it was too expensive and it should be a gift because she is family. I responded by saying that it was too easy to say she was family to get a free dress, but not enough to include my son. She cried on the call and begged me not to ruin her day, but I didn't call because that to me was bullshit.  At no point did she offer to just let my son go or apologize for it.  And for anyone who said that maybe she's homophobic, I'm not sure, but I think who could be influencing her is her fianc\u00e9 who is a Christian and has never been close to my son. However, I don't care if he's doing it or not. If she wants to exclude my son from this event then she will also be cutting ties with me.  And for those who are asking for a photo of the dress, I'm sorry to disappoint you, but my son didn't agree and unfortunately I won't post it because of that.  If anything else happens I'll let you know, until then, thank you all!",

Thankfully the offers of charity have stopped (here's hoping they were redirected to their communities) but a good deal of them asking whether or not I stopped being a grinch and started being a good husband and father again.  So, to get those people placated first, here you go:  I DECORATED.  Pics without our faces only, sorry.   [https://imgur.com/H4b2Cak](https://imgur.com/H4b2Cak) [https://imgur.com/QySEGOS](https://imgur.com/QySEGOS) [https://imgur.com/w074cpg](https://imgur.com/w074cpg)  I also spoke with a financial advisor, who is helping me set up a budget for 2020, and a counselor who helped me realize that I was worth more than the goods I could offer someone.  She recommended 2 separate therapists to me, and neither are taking new patients before the new year, so for now, my wife and I are working on our budget and cleaning out various corners of the house for things to sell.  So far, we've gotten rid of some unused basement furniture, a mini fridge that has been empty for 2 years, a bunch of wine racks and paraphernalia (we don't drink at home since the baby was born 2 years ago, so no need to keep it around) as well as some other things and made about $750, more than enough to pay all the overdue bills, put some money in savings, and groceries in the cupboard.  It's going to be a long road to pay off this cc debt, but we're finally addressing the issue head on and moving in the right direction. Since my last paycheck (that covered mortgage and utilities, no worries there, for those who asked if I was behind, thank you) I have also been offered (and taken) 3 DJ gigs for Holiday parties.  2 for personal friends/acquaintances businesses, 1 for a charity.  I refused payment for the children's charity gig, instead offering to give the money right back to the kids instead, which was gratefully accepted by the organizer.  The extra cash from the 2 paying gigs paid down some more debt, and was enough leftover to allow me to have bought some nice new books and a Moana doll for my little girl to open on Xmas morning, (to say nothing of the bags of presents from both sets of grandparents full of clothes and toys, so she'll be fine from a presents standpoint). Inspired by everyone's offers of charity, I volunteered again at Paul's Place in Baltimore, where this time I donned the hairnet and apron and served hot meals.  Cell phones are prohibited inside, plus taking photos of yourself doing charity work defeats the purpose of said work.  I also organized a food drive at my office to provide meal kits for Christmas for needy families, and we were able to donate 574 lbs of food to the MD Food Bank! Thank you to all who reached out and made me realize that I really was an asshole.  I let my personal shortcomings almost ruin a holiday for my wife and child.  It won't be as fancy as our last Christmases, but I have a feeling that this year will be very special to me, no matter how little is under my tree.  I realized that I have all the gifts I need, and I cannot thank the beautiful people who offered up so much charity to a grumpy stranger.  I didn't need to accept your gifts to accept your love, and the offers alone changed my life.  Happy Holiday's y'all.",

        "selftext": "I'm 19f, I have a 3 week old baby girl. I do still live with my parents, but since I pay rent equally, they say I can have just as much of a say in who comes and goes from the house as they do. I've never actually taken advantage of this rule until recently enough. I have a brother, who's 26 and his wife is 24. They're crunchy parents to a 8 month old. Basically what that is is fucking stupid, they use reusable wipes/nappies, think formula is the epitome of evil, babywearing, the list just goes on. I'm the complete opposite, pacifiers, supplementing with formula due to low supply, disposable wipes and nappies. They are completely against the products I use and often give me things like SiLs breastmilk in bags, disposable nappies their LO has grown out of, etc. I've used some but it's not really my cup of tea. On Monday night, my bother and SiL were minding my baby for me since it was my birthday and my babys father (not together, very close friends and co parents) took me to get some dinner in one of my favourite fast food places. It was great and really relaxing.  When I got home that evening, my SiL said that she did some cleaning and threw out anything I don't need. This immediately gave me red flags but they were in a hurry to get out the door and left almost immediately. When I went into the nursery, every disposable nappy and wipe pack was gone and replaced with some reusable cloth ones. Same with my formula, there was 8 tubs and all of it was gone, I'm not able to replace them at the moment and soley breastfeeding isn't sustainable for us. I was extremely angry and I just turned my phone off to avoid being mean to my SiL. She and my brother came over yesterday to collect something they forgot and that was when I confronted her. I told her she has to replace everything she dumped. When she said she can't afford to, I said fine, just get out and don't come back until I've been reimbursed or everything is replaced with the original items. My brother thinks I'm being a massive asshole and he's on his wifes side. Our parents think im being completely reasonable here but they think telling her essentially not to come back is taking it too far. AITA?",

        "selftext": "My son Aiden (23) moved back in with us upon graduating college as my husband wanted. My husband's original plan was to have Aiden live with us for free, but stay home and help with his disabled younger brother (16). Aident started complaining about needing money and wanted to find a job. My husband was against this and even offered to double his allowance but Aiden was growing tired of staying at home. So he began looking for jobs here and there for over a year but non of his job applications came through. He'd just apply and they never get back to him. We were confused by this til recently, I found out that my husband was behind all the job applications being cancelled. He'd wait tol Aiden applies then he proceeds to cancel the application by impersonating him and using his email. I blew up at him for this but his justification is that he's just trying to make sure that our younger son is cared for by Aiden and said that Aiden has been big help and him getting a job will affect his care for his brother. I went ahead and rented an apartment for Aiden and told him to stay there til he finds a job and starts paying for it himself. Aiden was hurt upon knowing what his dad did. My husband was livid when he found out. He called me unhinged and said that I was separating the boys and teaching Aiden to become selfish and care more about a job than family. He also said it was huge decision for me to rent an apartment without even running it with him. He's been giving me hell about it and is calling me a terrible mother for encouraging Aiden to be selfish and selfcentered. He said I needed to see and understand why he did what he did. [Edit] few things to mention: (1) My husband says that since he and I have health issues then we could use Aiden's help. (2) When I suggested outside help, my husband refused saying he won't ask anything from anybody and that his son is his problem and no body else's. (3) I used money from our joint account to pay for the rental apartment. My husband said it was wrong and that it was a major waste of money since we deal with medical bills consistenly.",

Well, family started trying to throw money at us to make it bigger and more spectacular. We were surprised, but it was a good surprise. Then the demands started coming out. They wanted this, they wanted that, they wanted this person to come, these colors, dresses can't do this, this person has to be flower girl, this person HAS to be a groomsman, etc etc. Suddenly it didn't feel like our wedding, but an excuse for our families to have a family reunion. We put our foot down and said: >Thank you all for your kindness and generosity when it comes to our wedding. Unfortunately, it looks like we may not have been on the same page as the rest of you. When we were offered money for this wedding, we did not realize it came with strings attached. With so many requests and so many demands from people we didn't expect would think they had a say in *our* wedding, we have decided to give everyone their money back.   >  >Our understanding of what a gift is must be very different.  >  >If you would like to give us money without strings attached or requests or demands, we will gracefully accept it. But if you believe a gift should come with stipulations, we must regretfully, and politely decline. This has caused an epic shitstorm. Such to the point where I have people saying they will never come to our wedding (honestly, not the worse thing in the world), that we are spoiled, we're assholes, etc etc etc. My parents are rather upset about it, but hers (who never made any demands and gave us a small cash gift) said we did the right thing.

He can be quite rude and make backhanded comments about me and the family sometimes which is bothersome but my sister says he's not malicious but is just the brutally honest time and we should get used to it. I visited my parents house to celebrate my sister's birthday and my husband couldn't come with me because he was busy, after the party we all sat down for dinner and my sister's boyfriend said it was weird that my husband and I don't have kids despite being married for 6 years now, I was shocked that he brought this up but I gave a short answer stating that it's because of infertility issues, he asked on which side and I didn't wanna answer but my sister said it's on my side. I got uncomfortable as he looked at me for a second and said that maybe not having kids now is a good thing because he thought women over 30 might produce defective babies due to age. I told him it was none of his business but he said that he was just giving his honest opinion and that's all. I, in return, told him while maintaining eye contact: trust me, if I wanted an asshole's opinion, I would've farted!. Literally everyone at the table bursted into laughter and my sister and her boyfriend were stunned. Few seconds later her boyfriend excused himself out and my sister followed then sent me a text after they left saying I was mean and disrespectful towards her boyfriend and insulted him maliciously just cause he stated his honest opinion, she also said I ruined her birthday by being petty and making her boyfriend the joke of the night infront of the family. I didn't respond but she demanded an apology via mail as soon as possible, mom agreed that I shouldn't have said what I said and should've just ignored him knowing how he is.

        "selftext": "I\u2019m 15 years old. I have a stepsister who is a couple years older than me and she is really seriously disabled. I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s wrong with her because no one ever wants to discuss it with me but she\u2019s non verbal, breaks her bones a lot, and has severe epilepsy and will have many fitting episodes. She also doesn\u2019t understand stuff. That\u2019s probably the easiest way to put it. She\u2019s just a human body with nothing inside.  She\u2019s my stepmoms daughter. My stepmom married my dad 3 years ago and they dated only for a year before that. I don\u2019t know my stepmom very well and I don\u2019t really get on with her. We are respectful to each other but I\u2019m basically living with strangers because she\u2019s so busy with her daughter and my dad. I am always on my own and I used to hate it but I\u2019m used to it now. Ever since they moved in to live with us life changed drastically for me because all the care now revolves around my stepsister. That\u2019s fine, I get it, but both my stepmom and my dad ask me to do things for my stepsister that I don\u2019t want to do and I resent doing. Stuff like staying home when I want to go to the mall with my friends, they\u2019re disappointed that I don\u2019t get her anything for her birthday with my very limited funds, etc.  My own mom passed away when I was small so I can\u2019t go and stay anywhere else and all in all I\u2019m just a lot more angry than I used to be because they seem really disappointed whenever I say I don\u2019t want to do anything for her. Even stuff like feeding her- like- I don\u2019t want to sit there feeding her banana pudding and wiping her drool. I didn\u2019t ask for this.  Anyway, she recently fell a few days ago and had a seizure for 8 minutes. She was taken to hospital and the doctors want to keep her in and look after her. I don\u2019t want to go and visit her. I remember seeing my mom in hospital before she died and I just hate hospitals and I sort of hate my stepsister and I just don\u2019t want to go and visit someone who doesn\u2019t even know I\u2019m there.  My stepmom is really upset with me and so is my dad. They haven\u2019t yelled at me or anything but they are both being super cold towards me because I don\u2019t want to visit. My grandma who lives in Canada called me up out the blue and told me it was okay and I don\u2019t need to force myself to go to the hospital so I\u2019m assuming my dad has told her I\u2019m refusing to go. He keeps pleading with me but I keep telling him I\u2019m not doing it. I told him hospitals remind me of mom and he got even more upset and said my stepsister might die and I need to stop being so selfish towards my stepmom.  I just want to know what Reddit thinks because half my friends think I should go and the other half think I\u2019m justified in saying no.",

        "selftext": "So here is the situation. Me: nurse. Working 50ish hours a week in paediatric ICU. Cry at least once a week because that shit is hard. My salary pays our bills. All of them.  Husband: 25M. Has a degree but isn't looking for a job. Works 2 days a week at the grocery store. Spends most of his time playing LoL.  Btw all events here are in accordance with Covid Legislation.  Today was supposed to be A Good Day. I had been begging my husband to swap his Saturday shift to literally anything else so that we could have days off together. We haven't had a weekend together since our wedding, 18mo ago.  Today was supposed to be our first Saturday off together. We were going to go to an animal sanctuary. He starts the day by going to breakfast. With his best mate. Leaving before I even wake up. I wake up around 9 and realise he is not home. Call. He says he's helping his mate set up some lights and that the weather is too rainy for the animal sanctuary anyway.  He gets home at 1ish. Lies around. Plays some video games, promising we would cook dinner together tonight. Leaves again at 5 to help the same mate with something else.  I go grocery shopping. I don't drive because of medical issues, but I walk there and back in the rain. I get home, realise I've left my keys inside. Call husband, knowing he's 5min away. He says he will leave in a minute. I sit in the rain and the cold (southern hemisphere). 45 min later, I call again. He hasn't left yet. He finally agrees to come and let me in the house, so he drives up, presses the clicker to let me in the garage and leaves again.  At 10, I I called to see where he is. His friend answers. Says he is driving out to do something an hour away.  It's 10.30. I am going to bed. I have sent him a txt that I am upset and don't want to speak to him tonight and would rather he left me alone.  As far as I am concerned, if he can't value me more than his best mate on the first day off he and I have shared in a year and a half, he can go sleep in his bed instead. (Btw, his friend doesn't work, so they hang out all the time when I am at work).  He is going to be upset. And he is gonna tell his mate and his mate is going to tell him I'm being a bitch.  AITA Adding some info: I am 26. We weren't always like this. I don't know what changed. I'm fairly confident he's not having an affair. And I fully intend on talking this through, but at a time that isn't 4am.  Also the crying: sick babies sometimes make me sad, and I love all my patients. That's why I cry. And I don't mean hours of sobbing. I mean stepping into a supply closet to take a moment before getting back to work.  Also thank you for your kindness. I was expecting maybe 5 replies. I am trying to respond as much as I can. But there are a lot of you.",

        "selftext": "My girlfriend has online summer courses and she had an exam for one of them this morning.  I usually wake her up for pretty much everything because she sleeps through her phone alarm no matter how long it buzzes or how many she sets.  She has joked that I\u2019m her butler before and within the context of a relationship it\u2019s ok so I didn\u2019t mind, obviously I want to love my partner and try make her life easy.  However last night she was chatting with her friends and she thought I couldn\u2019t hear. She was bragging that I\u2019m her little bitch and I do everything for her when she tells me to, etc. It really hurt my feelings because they were making comments like \u2018good, put him in his place\u2019 and she was agreeing.  She specifically said \u2018yeah I\u2019m not worried about tomorrow because the bitch will make sure I\u2019m up and he\u2019ll probably have breakfast ready for me too\u2019  I went to bed pretty hurt by it, and come morning I didn\u2019t bother to wake her up when her alarm started to go. She usually only gets up when someone physically shakes her, but I let her turn off her alarm and she slipped back into sleep and I turned around and went back to sleep too.  When she woke up she was yelling at me saying I\u2019m an asshole and I\u2019ve cost her her exam and I\u2019m a piece of shit for what I did. EDIT: sorry for not responding sooner I wrote this up on my break at work and now I have to get back to it (can\u2019t have my phone, work with food) I wasn\u2019t expecting this many replies so fast.  I think we\u2019re breaking up. I told her this morning after she called me a \u2018bitch\u2019 for being upset re being called a bitch, lol, but she says she\u2019s not done with me.  I\u2019m just trying to get through today\u2019s shift and then deal with stuff later. I\u2019ll try and get back as I can. We\u2019ve been together a year and it was my first real relationship but I\u2019m tired of her not acknowledging how shitty she made me feel and still calling me a bitch. That word is really making me feel shit and small.",

        "selftext": "Quick backstory, after graduating high school my son moved 3 states away for college. At 19 he married a girl he met, I tried convincing him to wait because I personally felt he was too immature. They both dropped out and moved back here to his home town. At 20 they had their first child, a beautiful little girl. 16 months later, my DIL gave birth to their second child, a little boy.  After the first baby, my wife and I noticed our DIL wasn\u2019t happy. We both thought it was PPD related. Just after the second arrived, my son and his wife separated. She would bring the kids over for a visit, it was then she began unloading on us. I know there\u2019s two sides to every story, but considering I know my son, I believed her. I sat my son down numerous times to speak with him regarding his marriage. He refused to take responsibility, blamed her for everything even when I directly pointed out where he was the sole problem.  They got into counseling, for a year things were \u2018ok\u2019 on the surface. Our DIL filed for divorce, my son 3 days later was on Facebook announcing his new girlfriend. A month later, they were engaged. My son had forced his then wife to become a permanent SAHM at the birth of their first child. She of course had no other family or friends here, she knew no one aside from us. She had nowhere to go with two small children. Unbeknownst to our son, my wife and I helped her financially and got her an apartment.  Before the divorce was even finalized, we received a wedding invitation. I made it clear to my son, I would not be attending and they would not have my blessing. His mother told him she would see to it that I would attend. I stayed consistent in my decision, I also asked him not to bring his fianc\u00e9e around our house out of respect for the mother of his children.  The wedding happened on Feb 11. The night before, my wife gave me the finial push. I did not attend. Our daughter, also did not attend for the same reasons. My wife picked up our grandkids, got them dressed and attended the wedding. My daughter and I decided to spend the evening with his ex. I couldn\u2019t imagine her sitting alone, while her kid\u2019s attended their father\u2019s wedding.  She was taken aback that I didn\u2019t end up attending his wedding. We took her out to distract her mind. I just wanted her to know, she\u2019ll always be considered family to us. My daughter also made a joke they can drop the in-law status and just be sisters now. She was very tearfully grateful, I realized just how badly she needed our support and specifically on that night.  The next morning, my son called to tell me how much of a horrible father I am for not attending his wedding. Few days later he caught wind that I spent the wedding evening with his ex. He said that was the ultimate form of betrayal, and further myself and his sister would have to earn an relationship with him on his terms only. *****ETA: First, I\u2019d like to sincerely thank each and everyone of you for your support, encouragement, and all the awards. I know without a doubt, I did the right thing. I even feel differently now, his mother should not have attended either. But we can\u2019t go back and undo that.  So, my son saw the post. I had sent my daughter the link yesterday so she could read the comments. This morning she texts me at work\u2026DAD YOU WENT VIRAL! Lol But anyways, he sent screenshots of the post and all my comments to his mom. He also told her\u2026\u201dHe\u2019s dead to me now.\u201d Time will tell if he means that. I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll see this update too. For that reason, I\u2019m positively certain the second he needs another cash loan I won\u2019t be dead anymore.  His mom told him, \u201cYour children have to be our number one priority.\u201d They\u2019re not just some disposable items you can leave behind when one chapter of your life closes. Maybe one day, he\u2019ll understand this.",

        "selftext": "Throwaway account. So me (26f) and my husband (28m), who I'll call Jake for this story, have been together for 5 years and married for 3. We have recently started trying for a baby as we both felt like that was the next step in our life together, and 3 weeks ago I got a positive test back.  We were really really happy and told our families, and now my mom and MIL want to throw a big baby shower for us, it was just super good news all around.  Well 2 nights ago me and Jake were getting ready for bed when he reminds me to go through the house and make sure all the lights are off. Now he can be a little lazy at times, and it has become a nightly routine for me to make sure all the lights are off that he leaves on before we go to bed. I wasn't feeling very well and asked if he could just do it since he wasn't doing anything and was literally standing by the door. He then tells me No, this is what is expected of you every night. I was a little hurt but I didn't want to fight with him so I just did it. When I came back Jake goes on this very long and unprovoked rant saying things like Just because you are pregnant does not mean anything will change and You are still expected to cook, clean, and do all the chores every day because how can you be expected to be a mother if you can't handle a little work. He wasn't yelling or anything, he was talking to me quietly like a was 2 inches tall.  I was shocked because I had never heard him say anything like this. The rant went on for about 30 minutes before I interjected and asked Well what do you plan on doing to help me with all of this. He then got extremely defensive saying he works his ass of at his job to provide for me and what is going to be our future children. (For context I don't work atm, my job was not paying enough to justify me going so I am a full time college student) He ended by saying that it doesn't matter how I feel physically or mentally, it is a mothers job to push through, and if he helped and babied me I wouldn't be a good mother. I got extremely upset and started yelling and I said that I wish I would've known this is how you felt before I got pregnant with your baby. There was a moment of silence before he started crying and he left for the night to stay at his mothers house. He hasn't been back yet and my MIL and SIL have called me berating me and saying I broke Jakes heart with what I said and I need to apologize immediately, and until I do he isn't coming home. I don't know how to feel.  So AITA for yelling at my husband after he said he isn't helping me with anything during the pregnancy because its a mothers job to deal with it? EDIT: First I want to thank you all for your responses. I'm sorry I haven't really responded to anyone specifically but I really do appreciate you guys. A few of you asked if I told my MIL and SIL what he said, which I did. They basically said I was being sensitive and all he meant was pregnancy isn't an excuse to be lazy, he meant no harm. ......ok. I am getting some things together and am going to be headed to my mom and dads house. My mom is furious with him and doesn't want me apologizing to him or talking to him without the situation either being recorded or having a witness. Regardless, I am ok and will be ok. I do appreciate all of you though, you have opened my eyes to many things I may have been ignoring or looking past over the years.",

        "selftext": "I'm in a relationship with a guy who also works in tech. He makes 68k and I make 130k. I am a mechanical engineer at a robotics startup. He works at a more stable job doing programming at a large company.  He brought me to meet his friends at a party and they asked me about myself. His friends mostly work in tech too and talked about themselves in terms of their jobs. I told them I'm an hiker, I do archery, I love road trips and camping and riding dirtbikes, etc. Basically talking about my hobbies because work is just a way to get paid to do the shit I love. It's not how I define myself and it doesn't come to mind when someone wants me to tell them about myself.  One of his friends asked about work and I said Oh gosh, I don't wanna talk about work at a party! Spent my whole day sweating my ass off in 95 degree heat trying to replace this busted ass motor just to find the replacement part was also fucked. I wasn't lying or trying to downplay that I have a good job, that really is how I spent my day, and I wasn't in the mood to talk shop at a party!   Some other conversations came up casually that probably also made me seem poorer like me saying that car dealership repairs were a ripoff, and telling my boyfriend that my childhood neighbors trailer caught on fire and I was gonna visit and help her out I wasn't doing it on purpose, I was literally just talking about my life, but I guess I gave the impression I was poorer It got later in the night, everyone was getting drunker, and some of his friends (not close ones tho) were making jokes about me growing up in a trailer and being a gold digger. And being ready to jump to a richer guy. Really misogynistic shit honestly, since they don't even know me and seemed to just assume all girls are good diggers. He didn't say anything. He later said it was because he'd smoked weed and gets quiet and has trouble carrying on a quick conversation when he's high. But regardless I felt hurt he didn't say anything.  I got irritated with his friends and asked Now why the hell would you say that when I make twice what he does? His friends went quiet for a second and I continued saying There ain't no gold to dig here, not with him or anyone at this party. So do y'all think I'm cheap, or do y'all think I'm stupid?  My boyfriend wanted to leave the party shortly after and he was pretty upset with me for telling everyone I make twice what he does. I said I would have held my tongue if he'd checked his friends himself. But he didn't say anything so I wasn't about to let them talk to me like that. He said it was humiliating and now everyone thinks I'm a bitch, and I flippantly said at least they know I'm a rich bitch  He was angry I embarrassed him when I spoke up, I was angry I had to say anything at all because his friends were talking shit so it should be on him to check them. Stuff is still tense. AITA for explaining why I'm not a gold digger?",

We aren\u2019t too close to her since she lives pretty far away. She was over our house and she started complimenting my son (my son is 19). It starts off innocent but as time goes on it gets more and more crossing the line.  When we were out on my deck she starts telling my son to take his shirt off, 'whats the point of going to the gym if no one will see it.' My son is visibly uncomfortable and tries to shut her down. She repeatedly is asking and is getting more aggressive with it. I interject and I am like Hey Kathy, I think you are a bit too old and ugly for my son.  This got her upset really quickly, and she excuses herself to the bathroom and starts crying. My wife goes to comfort her, and then later she leaves.  At the end of it my wife is super angry with me for saying that, that I should have said hey Cathy looks like you had too much to drink or something else. I told my wife, that Kathy (btw this is not her real name) works a corporate job she has had training on this and that she knows better. And our son was uncomfortable. He is 18+ but he doesn't know how to deal with an adult-adult let alone someone saying that in our house.  I told my wife flat out that if I was to invite a guy friend and he was to ask to see our daughter in a bikini my wife would have called the police. She says its different. I tell her that I was way kinder to Kathy than I would have been had a guy said something like that to our daughter. And I told my wife that Kathy needs to apologize to my son before she can ever come into our house again.  Overall, I think I was fair. If Kathy just said it once and I said that I think I would be the asshole, but the fact she kept repeating it that's why I said it. And I wanted her to get the message that yes I am upset that's why I included the ugly part.",

        "selftext": "This issue is honestly making me frustrated. Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help. I am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19. I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway. But there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend. I was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.It all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted. She had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's, 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway. I was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi. She is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied. Edit: I am honestly really grateful for not only judging me(not in that way) but also giving me love and support. Each comment means the world to me. I am honestly crying reading some of the encouragement. No one besides my family has said these things to me. I know it might seem silly,but it geniunely means the world to me guys. From the bottom of my heart,thank you. Edit 2: Honestly the support is geniunely overwhelming. I promise to not let you down and to continue being a good person. Thank you for the gold.Thank you all so much for the private messages you have sent me too. I honestly have gone through as many as I can and I just feel really fortunate and grateful. I sincerely hope you all have an amazing life ahead. Thank you so so much, this has been one of the highlights of my year. Edit 3: I am sorry for boring you with all these edits. I geniunely can't thank you guys enough. I showed my parent's these posts and they had tears of joy too. I am so thankful to each and every one of you guys, loads of love. BUT, I have been noticing a worrying number of DMs saying me I could have used her body and had some fun after knowing the truth etc. I am not this kind of person and I hope nobody is. I have my own integrity. It's NOT right to just forcefully have sex with her, that's appalling. A couple of other DMs sent me links to secret webcams to expose her nudes etc. It's honestly horrifying. I am not that kind of person and shall never ever be one. I just want to make the world a better place and the people around me happy.  I thank these people for their support, but their way to go around it is very wrong. A lot of women ARE amazing. My mother is amazing, the person who sent the screenshots is amazing, my coworkers are amazing, and I am sure many women out there are amazing.  Please don't tell me to take 'the red pill' or anything of that sort. Because I am not going to do that, ever. Please don't say all women are manipulative etc.  This post isn't anti-women in anyway, it's me talking about the person I believe wronged me.",

This wouldn't be a problem except she doesn't visit for an evening. She will come for a week. And for that week I'm an unpaid nanny.  If we go out to a restaurant I have to entertain them because my mom needs to talk to my sister and BIL.  You get the picture.  My parents decided that since this was my last summer before I became an adult we would be going to Disneyland to celebrate my graduation.  I asked who was going and they said it was just the three of us.  But when we got to the airport my sister and her family were there. Strangely enough they were also going to Disneyland.  I went into my backpack and grabbed my passport. I put it in my sock.  When we got to the international security I couldn't find it. We looked everywhere.  I had to Uber home and I missed my flight. Oh well. I get to stay home by myself for a week of peace and quiet.  My parents were very mad at me for losing my passport. The money they spent on my flight and entrance was wasted. Darn.  My mom and sister have both been posting about how hard it is to be at Disneyland with two little ones. They both posted that I ruined the vacation by being so thoughtless.  My dad says he knows why I did and he understands. But he says I should have let him know so he didn't waste money. He said he would have gone along with my ruse.  I feel bad about wasting money but I have been to Disneyland before. And I will go again later by myself or with friends.",

        "selftext": "The title sounds bad but hear me out.  Backstory: I (F28) have a friend (F28) who purchased a house late last year. It's an awesome 2 story town house and I've been over there plenty of times to help out with moving/decorating and for hanging out. As mentioned in the title, her parents purchased the house for her and her partner. I truly have no issue with this as the housing market is terrible for buyers so more power to them for being home owners. I recently, unfortunately inherited my parents house, which is 3 bedroom, out in the sticks.  The issue: We went appliance shopping because most of the the stuff in the house was 10-15 years old. We were standing with an employee who I had asked to recommend some smaller items like toasters and kettles when the employee asked if I was moving out as general chit chat. I told him I was moving, and he asked whether I bought or rented. I told him bought, because it was just easier and less awkward than telling him I inherited the house. He told me that was cool and began talking about the toasters again when my friend cut in that I had inherited my house, not purchased it. The employee went quiet and I gave her a what was that face. I was taken aback, she continued on saying Yeah, *I* purchased my house. I asked does it really matter? I'm here to buy some kitchen appliances not tell this guy my personal issues. She grinned and said it's just for the record which made me more confused and annoyed. (You can probably see where this is going) I replied Oh okay then if it's just for the record your parents purchased your house for you. The employee quickly retreated and she walked outside of the shop. I caught up with her and she said I was a massive asshole for pointing out she couldn't afford to own without her parents help. I returned with a very similar my parents also helped me with getting a house too, just in a really terrible way. My partner agrees with me, saying that she's the one that opened that door, but our other friends are split almost 50/50. Edit: Holy hell this blew up. Sorry I wasn't clear with my friends being 50/50, half think I'm NTA and the others think we're both assholes and I shouldn't have escalated the problem.",

        "selftext": "EDIT TITLE : AITA for NOT telling a guy what I do for work and letting him pay for my drinks during the whole evening? ---- My friend Grace invited me to a board game bar to play and have drinks with her, her boyfriend and one of their friend's Nick. We went to get drinks in pairs, Grace going with her boyfriend, meanwhile Nick and I stayed at the table and vice versa. So Nick and I had plenty of time to talk just the two of us.  Nick started the night by telling about his recent career change, he decided to quit his previous job, go to a coding bootcamp and he got a job as a developer one or two months ago. He was very proud of himself and his new salary and told me this multiple times.  He never asked me what I do for work, but talked about his new job quite a lot, occasionally saying sorry, you don't understand that, haha. During the entire evening, I never told him I has been working as a software engineer for the past 4 years, because he never asked and honestly, I found it a bit entertaining.  When it came to the drinks, he invited me to every single one. Don't worry about it, it's not a problem with my devoper salary. I told him multiple times he doesn't have to pay for me, but he insisted.  At the end of the night, when we were saying our goodbyes, he took out his phone to send me a friend request on Facebook. My job is listed in my profile, so that was when he realized that I'm software engineer.  He asked me if it's true that I'm a software engineer and I answered yes. He asked me why I haven't told him, why did I let him believe I was a cashier like Grace used to be (?? I never implied that), and why did I let him pay for everything when I probably earn more than him.  I told him that he never once asked and it was his fault he assumed. He could have simply asked me about my job, but he only wanted to brag about his. But if he wants me to, I can pay him back for the drinks.  He was a angry and said I made a fool out of him. I think he did that, not me. But now Grace and her boyfriend are on his side too, saying that it would've cost me nothing to tell him early in the evening and I only kept it for myself for my own entertainment.  Well, I did find it entertaining, but I don't really feel like I did anything wrong. AITA?",

        "selftext": "So, my MIL (I'm a gal btw lol) came to stay with us for few weeks til her home is renovated for christmas. The problem is that she has been randomly walking in on me while I'm in the bathroom. Thankfully not once has she seen me naked because I started picking up on her behavior after the second time in a week. She'd barge in, then turns and says oh sorry then close the door. I tried talking to my husband about it but he kept ignoring me then flatout said so what if she accidently seen you naked? She's faaaammmillly!!. He seriously said that!. We have a lock and I could've used it but I have past trauma from the idea of locking/being locked in a room after my brother locked me in the bathroom when I was 5. So I came up with this idea. I'd go inside the bathroom pretending to use it and wait for her to come (cause honestly? It's deliberate at the this point). When she accidently barges in she'd see me in a weird/awkward position. For example doing a ballet stand, standing on the toilet, or standing facing the wall with my hands up, (fully clothed of course). I could see how awkward and weird this would be for her because she'd stand there for few seconds trying to figure out what I was doing. It was halirious at first seeing her initial confusion but she told my husband about it claiming she's caught me practicing rituals in the bathroom. I cleared things up and revealed the reason why. My husband was livid. He called me childish and said that I made his mom feel terrified/weirded out by my behavior. He said I should've acted maturely and locked the damn door instead of playing mind games. Edit. Lol. Um what? I just came back on here and saw literally 1000s? of people? OMG now I feel embarrassed Glad I went anonymous Lol. But seriously...I'm looking at my screen and am like ....I'm famous? Seriously though...My husband and his mom are extremely upset with me. He still thinks it was ridiculous and is demanding an apology before she goes back to her home.  I'm not sure if I will apologize because yes while it was a me problem that I couldn't use the lock. It's still feels wrong what she did and maybe I'm wrong too but at least I got (so did you apparently lol) a bit of a chuckle out of it \ud83d\ude05\ud83e\udd23 also, I'm sure Thanksgiving dinner will hella awkward tomorrow.

        "selftext": "My (25F) father married my step-sister's (23F) mother when I was 4 and she was 3. We've lived together most of our lives and are a family. She and I were extremely close. She developed cancer when she was 14 and was sick for about 2 years. She's since made a full recovery. During that time, my parents became understandably over-protective. They also asked a lot of me. I quit my extracurriculars so I could get a job (the money went towards her medical bills) and so I could drive her to appointments. I didn't go to dances and any fun activities I did needed to include her. I did almost all of this willingly, the exception being having to quit my high school volleyball team - I did throw a bit of a tantrum about that, but was swiftly punished. And I think having one emotional breakdown was pretty chill given the circumstances. Anyhow, I go to college and meet my ex, we'll call him Ben, when I'm a junior. We fall in love, blah blah blah. He and I move in together when we graduate, so we've been living together for about 3 years. We were serious until July when I walked into my bedroom and saw him fucking my sister. I broke it off, tears were shed, he moved out, etc. My sister apologized at first but then backed off. I thought she was giving me space but last week she called and asked if we could meet up. She told me that she and Ben were in love and were just telling me as a courtesy before they started posting photos online. Distraught,  I left her in the restaurant by herself and did not pay my portion of the bill. She later venmo'ed me asking for the money. She told my parents who then called me to their house, telling me how disappointed in me they are for not supporting my sister's relationship with Ben. They brought up the fact that because she had cancer as a teenager, she never learned proper social etiquette, and has a hard time meeting people. I don't buy this, in part because I've seen her socialize just fine and since we spent a good chunk of the time she was sick together, that would also mean that I should have bad social skills as well, by that logic. They then told me that if I don't accept my sister and Ben's relationship, they may have to go no contact with me. I reminded them that I'm also their daughter and they should understand my point of view, but they are adamant that this is about me being jealous of her. For the record: I'm not jealous of her. I'm not upset that Ben picked her over me. I'm sad about the end of the relationship and do feel betrayed, but lord knows that I don't want to be with a cheater. What I'm upset about is the fact that my sister chose Ben over me. That she slept with Ben knowing he and I were in a long-term, committed relationship, and continues to be with him knowing how much it hurts me. Now no one in my immediate family is talking to me and I'm getting messages from aunts and uncles and cousins telling me that I'm an asshole and a selfish bitch.   Edit: Thank you everyone so much for your comments. This has gotten more attention than I expected and am having trouble keeping up, so if I don't say thank you, then thank you. I've been given a lot of food for thought. TBH, while I've had moments where I've been resentful or upset about my teenage years, I've always thought that I did the right thing for my sister and for my family. And that time wasn't all miserable; I was very close to my sister and we made things as fun as we could. But I didn't think of it as an abdication of my parent's responsibilities or that they were doing wrong by me, which many of you pointed out. I definitely have a lot to think about. Thank you again for making me feel less crazy about all of this!   UPDATE: Sometimes you can only laugh. Just got off of the phone with my cousin who saw this post and said he could explain a few things. I asked him why he was on Reddit instead of school, he asked me why I was on Reddit instead of work, and I said touch\u00e9. He told me that after my conversation with my mom, she went to his house and talked to my aunt. And here's the deal: Turns out my sister is not only in a relationship with Ben but **FOUR MONTHS PREGNANT**. Which means she and Ben were fucking for longer than I had even guessed. Apparently my parents are so adamant that I forgive her because I'm already ruining their experience of their first grandchild. That's right, I'm less important than my stepmom posting ultrasounds to Facebook. This is where we're at. Anyhow, I called out of work sick the rest of the day and am going to drink a lot of alcohol. Like, a lot of alcohol. And then start thinking about what the fuck I'm going to do.",

        "selftext": "I own a vape shop. We're a small business, only 12 employees.   One of my employees, Peggy, was supposed to open yesterday. Peggy has recently been promoted to Manager, after 2 solid years of good work as a cashier. I really thought she could handle the responsibility.   So, I wake up, 3 hours after the place should be open, and I have 22 notifications on the store Facebook page. Customers have been trying to come shop, but the store is closed. Employees are showing up to work, but they're locked out.    I call Peggy, and get no response. I text her, same thing. So I go in and open the store. An hour before her shift was supposed to be **over**, she calls me back.   I ask her if she's ok, and she says she needed to take a mental health day and do some self-care. I'm still pretty pissed at this point, but I'm trying to be understanding, as I know how important mental health can be. So I ask her why she didn't call me as soon as she knew she needed the day off. Her response: I didn't have enough spoons in my drawer for that..   Frankly, IDK what that means. But it seems to me like she's saying she cannot be trusted to handle the responsibility of opening the store in the AM.   So I told her that she had two choices:   1) Go back to her old position, with her old pay.   2) I fire her completely.   She's calling me all sorts of -ist now, and says I'm discriminating against her due to her poor mental health and her gender.  None of this would have been a problem if she simply took 2 minutes to call out. I would have got up and opened the store on time. But this no-call/no-show shit is not the way to run a successful business.  I think I might be the AH here, because I **am** taking away her promotion over something she really had no control over.   But at the same time, she really could have called me.   So, reddit, I leave it to you: Am I the asshole? EDIT: I came back from making a sandwich and had 41 messages.

My daughter and I recently went on a short trip out of state while my husband stayed as he had work and was supposed to look after our dog.  On the last day of our trip we got a call from my husband who was acting distraught and said that our dog Ellie had run away and that he could not find her. He claimed she just bolted away from him in the park, into some bushes and he could not find her. Our dog is quite small, a mini poodle mix and almost 13 years old, she is still active but it is really unlike her to run away from us and I was suspicious but chose to believe my husband and me and my daughter were in grief but did not want to blame him. When we came back home, he seemed surprisingly ok unlike us. Ever since the pandemic, my husband started working from home and he has always been annoyed at how much attention we gave Ellie and hated how Ellie begged to sit on our laps and his while he worked. A few days later we got a call from an animal rescue in a neighboring state quite far from us that she had been found. I picked the phone and it was on our landline which we almost never use these days but was the contact on the microchip. I told my husband and he just said that is great, I am so happy but it felt kind of blunt and insincere. I said it is strange that she got so far and he responded that someone must have stolen her and then abandoned her. This made little sense to me as to why that would happen. When he was out drinking with his buddies, I copied the videos from his dashcam for the days I was away and saw that he had indeed taken Ellie far out of state, and clearly dropped her in front of his car thrown a frisbee like object into a field, yelled fetch and drove off without her. I was livid and confronted him and he just stupidly muttered how he dropped her there so she could find a farm and have a better life and then the next day got really angry at me for viewing his dashcam and called me an my daughter AHs.",

Obviously, they can\u2019t have the wedding as planned, but they still would like to get married, so they decided on a \u201cZoom\u201d wedding where all of the family/friends would just call in to watch the officiant, my sister, and her fianc\u00e9.  My sister didn\u2019t want to be in charge of hosting the Zoom call because she thought it would stress her out, so she asked me to and I gladly accepted.  She and her fianc\u00e9 decided to invite everyone they originally wanted to, and it was a very big list. When we were going over the list, my sister mentioned to me that she wanted everyone else to be muted for the majority of the wedding as she was worried that others would talk over her and her fianc\u00e9 and quote \u201covershadow\u201d them on their big day \u201cthat was already scaled down\u201d. However, her and her fianc\u00e9 said that I should unmute everyone at one point so everyone could talk and have a nice time with each other.  Fast-forward to the day of the wedding\u2014everyone is muted during the ceremony which goes great, and so I then unmute everyone and ask to please raise a hand if they\u2019d like to talk so it doesn\u2019t get confusing. My cousin (around my age) starts waving his hand crazily, and he\u2019s with his longtime girlfriend (also similar age I guess). He\u2019s a very gregarious guy, so I was not surprised. Then, he says stuff like \u201c(my sister) and (her husband) are such an inspiration, it\u2019s given me the courage to do this....\u201d then turns to his girlfriend and pulls out a box that is the size of an engagement ring box?? I immediately saw this as him trying to steal the spotlight (something that he\u2019s done since we were kids, ex: he would secretly mess up my sister and I\u2019s drawings if the adults would praise ours) and booted him off of the call. Then I quickly announced that my cousin had technical difficulties and would not be joining again. Everyone else accepted this and went about talking, and my sister and her husband did too.  The rest of the wedding went smoothly\u2014except for the fact that my cousin kept texting me angrily saying that he finally wanted to propose as a surprise with family all around and I ruined it.

        "selftext": "This all started back in March. My son's best friend turned thirteen. In his family, thirteenth birthday is a huge deal. In addition to a massive party (which all four of us were invited to) his parents also took him to Disney World. They invited my son to attend as well. My wife was hesitant to consent to this. She said it was unfair to allow our son to go when our nine year old daughter can't. Especially since she loves Disney and princesses. I said that our kids won't always have the exact same opportunities, and if we set a precedent here, we'll have to stick to it if and when our daughter gets a similar opportunity. So we'd just be punishing both our children needlessly. My wife reluctantly agreed that we should allow our son to go. I gave our son money to buy his sister souvenirs. He did, and his friend's parents even bought extra stuff for him to give to her. Still, when she saw him come back wearing a Star Wars shirt with the Mickey hat and trading pin lanyard, she burst into tears. My wife later said we made a huge mistake and never should have let him go. I (mistakenly) thought all of that was behind us. Now, we are not well off financially, but my BiL is, and he invited all of us to visit a beach house he rented for a summer send-off. My wife told me she wants to have our son stay with my dad and just take out daughter to even the score. I told my wife that isn't happening. We are their parents. We can't favor one child over the other. Not being invited to the birthday trip of a kid you barely know is in no way comparable to being left out of a *family vacation* and I'm shocked she would even suggest such a thing. I refuse to allow it. Now my wife is angry, but I don't care. I'm not punishing my son for being lucky. AITA?",

We get to the airport and Becky got 7 other people first class tickets and me 1 coach ticket.  She told me I was used to it and she had a free coach ticket so I should be grateful for going. They all did their express check ins and left me in the long line for me to think about what the heck is going on. I had to keep from crying the whole time in line. I got up to the counter and there was a baggage fee to me. My boyfriend at the time never once helped me through the coach line or said anything to his mom. I looked over at his mom\u2019s smug face as I was about to pay the checked baggage fee. And I let all of my frustrations out on the attendant and started crying. Basically she said don\u2019t go with that family sweetie they don\u2019t appreciate you. Continues to cry and took my luggage and got out and got out of line with the super sweet check in woman. I was so upset on how I was treated and started crying on my boyfriend in the airport about how his mother was treating me.  I broke up with him at the airport and his mother was so embarrassed. I told her what a bitch she was.

She doesn't call me by name she calls me slim and I even heard her say one time go ask toothpick and she has said stuff like you need some meat on your bones & you need to eat. I have only worked there 8 days. I have asked her very nicely to stop. Yesterday I asked her to stop calling me slim again and she basically said it's her mouth and she can say what she wants.  Today when she said morning slim I replied morning chunky and she got upset and actually started crying. Everybody here at work, (only 6 of us total) is saying I'm wrong and I should apologize because being called fat is different than being called skinny because being called skinny is a compliment. I said as long as she calls me slim, I will call her chunky and now I'm the bad person. AITA if I don't apologize? The owner/manager has completely ignored the situation saying it's a high school issue and we should figure it out. EDIT FOR MORE INFO: We don't have HR. There's only 6 of us working here (cupcake shop). We are all regular employees. I went to the owner BEFORE I called her chunky and I asked him to talk to her because I felt she was harassing me. That's when he said we can handle it ourselves. That's why I called her chunky. I told her to stop calling me slim and I didn't like it and she continued to do it. She didn't stop doing it after I asked multiple times and I didn't know what to do besides what she was doing to me. She brought up my weight, I brought up her's.",

Recently my in laws were over, and we were all watching a movie together. It was a kids movie, and so my 15yo was bored out of her mind and tired, so she started to snuggle up to me and go to sleep. After the movie was over, we sent all the kids to bed/their rooms and got chatting for a bit longer. There was a fair bit of wine involved (I was sober though), and eventually after a short silence my FIL let it drop that he thought it was inappropriate I still cuddled with my 15yo. I don't really know why he brought it up suddenly, but I was prepared to laugh it off and just assumed it was the alcohol. To my surprise, my wife and MIL both agreed with him. I have a lot of respect for my in-laws, I get along with them great and I consider them closer than my own parents. Obviously I'm quite fond of my wife as well, but I outright told them to fuck off and go fuck themselves and then left them and went to bed. I've never spoken to any of them like that before, but it felt like the right thing to say in the moment. They all want me to apologize for being so rude to them. AITA?  Edit due to info request: We were not spooning, she was sitting next to me laying on my chest. Edit of my own free will: Idk if it's important info, but I didn't yell. Edit: I think I've read most everything now, thanks for all the messages of support and hate, I liked them all. Some people asked me to make an update post, I don't think I will, sorry. I've been speaking to them over the past few days and I know why they said what they said (although it's not relevant to me telling them to fuck off), but it's pretty personal and I don't feel like sharing. I wont be apologizing to any of them, especially now that I know their reasoning. I love my wife, but it hurts that she doesn't trust me.",

        "selftext": "When I (17 M) was 8, my parents bought me a piano and signed me up for lessons. I was super excited because I love music. Over time I kind of became known as the 'piano guy' at school. I play at school concerts, accompany the school jazz choir, and play once a week for the residents at a couple of retirement homes in our town. When I was 15, I started to talk about quitting lessons, and my parents quickly tried to guilt me out of it. I told them I wanted to try other things, and that between piano and studying, I didn't have much time left for other extra curriculars. My Dad proposed a deal. If I kept playing and taking lessons until I reached level 10 RCM (Royal Conservatory of Music), and continued to keep my grades up at school, he would buy me a new car of my choice. I jumped at it and we shook hands on the deal. I should explain that my family is well off financially. I have a very privileged life, but I wouldn't say I've been spoiled. If I ever want a luxury item like a new phone or game console, I have to buy it myself with money I've saved from summer and after school jobs. I should also explain that my Dad's big on loopholes.  When we compete, he always finds a way to win, and when I do it doesn't count because of some loophole. It drives me nuts, but he thinks it's hilarious.  Whenever I complain about him not playing fair, his answer is always the same: life isn't fair. So, because of our deal, I kept up with my lessons. I spent about 1-2 hours a day on piano, while keeping my grades up. Last summer, I took my level 9 RCM exams and passed, fulfilling my part of the deal. II told my Dad I'd chosen the BMW X5 plug-in hybrid SUV. A couple of months ago, on my birthday, I came downstairs for breakfast, and my Dad told me there was a surprise waiting for me in the garage. I ran out, and sitting in the middle of the floor was a 1/24 scale, toy BMW X5. My Dad burst out laughing and said, A deal's a deal, so as promised here is your brand new BMW! My heart absolutely broke. I asked if he was being serious, and he said I couldn't seriously have expected him to buy a 17 year old a real brand new BMW and that we could discuss getting me a reasonably priced used car. I said we had a deal and I fulfilled my end of it, he said he did too since I never said that the car had to be full size and drivable. I said he wasn't being fair. His response: life isn't fair. Ever since this happened, I've been distant with my Dad. I honestly feel like he betrayed my trust and that he deliberately made a fool out of me. He keeps bringing up the idea of a used car, but I told him I'm not interested, which I admit is kind of petty. I have enough money saved that I can buy a cheap used car myself, and I just feel like if I accept one from him now it's like saying that breaking his promise didn't matter and that he didn't do anything wrong.

        "selftext": "**UPDATE POSTED ON MY PAGE** This happened last night but my phone is still blowing up.  I F(26) dipped into my savings and got Mike, my boyfriend (27) a PS5 for his birthday yesterday.  He knew he was getting the PS5 because he told me that the PS5 is the only thing he wants. We\u2019ve been together for 4 years so the cost didn\u2019t matter. That is until, I found out what he thinks about me.  Some background: When I was 18, I was involved with Jake, a guy who I met online. We ended things after 3 months, and I moved on shortly after with Adam, a guy from work.  I found out a couple months later that Jake and Adam were actually really close friends but I didn\u2019t know Jake long enough to meet his friend group, so I had no idea.  After finding out, I took some time off dating and two years later, I met my current boyfriend Mike. I was upfront and honest with Mike about my past and the fact that I was unintentionally involved with friends. He said he understood and my past didn\u2019t bother him. Last night at his party, I showed up with the PS5 and him and his friends were screaming with joy. His best female friend Jessica laughed and said \u201cI wish I was a thot so I could afford a PS5 too.\u201d I looked at her with an \u201cexcuse me?\u201d Look on my face and she just said \u201cnevermind\u201d and walked away.  I confronted my boyfriend about it and he said and I quote \u201cshe\u2019s just messing with you. You can\u2019t take a joke?\u201d So I pushed further as to why this girl is even calling me names to begin with and he said \u201cwell, everyone knows you were a thot before you met me.\u201d  I asked him to explain how I was a thot before him and he said \u201cyou know\u2026messing with best friends?\u201d  He then pat me on the shoulder and said that it\u2019s okay because I\u2019m not who I was back then and if he could get over my \u201ccolourful past\u201d and \u201cthot mentalities\u201d to give me a chance, then I could get over Jessica\u2019s comments and give her another chance. I didn\u2019t say anything. I just got up. Took the PS5 from the gift table and left. He was PISSED. He literally called me like 20 times, but I didn\u2019t care. I was so hurt that I took the bow off and took it straight back to the store I got it from. They happily refunded it. I thought that was done but Mike and all his friends including Jessica are berating me for being petty and they\u2019re all saying I brought this on myself by making poor choices.  I responded to Mike and told him that he deserves better than me so find someone who wasn\u2019t a \u201cthot\u201d and get the PS5 from them because I returned it.  He started screaming how I\u2019m \u201cthe biggest AH\u201d for returning it and how I should be happy he ignored my \u201ccolourful past.\u201d  I\u2019m thinking maybe taking it back went too far.

        "selftext": "I sustained very bad injuries to my face this month. I'm in the stage of healing when the scar tissue has formed, but it's still very tender new skin. I'm going to have very obvious facial scarring for the rest of my life. The injury starts about an inch above my hairline, goes down over my brow so that on part, hair will not grow. It continues down my cheek where it is deepest; I'll always probably have an indentation in the fullest part of my cheek. Then it continues to my jawline.  In some ways it's OK. I'm happy it's just cosmetic damage. My friends are super reassuring, telling me how badass and sick it's gonna look. They say I'm still as hot as ever, now a little more sexy and mysterious lol. But in some ways it really sucks... I know that I'm always gonna be seen first as the girl with the scar and it feels especially bad when people look at me differently. This week, I had to fly home for a family thing; it was a plan I'd made long before my injury. I wasn't really looking forward to the pity or people making a big deal of it; I'd rather it not be acknowledged. I'd also met with my dermatologist who said that I was at the stage of scar tissue formation that I no longer should be dressing the wounds; the skin was healing and instead I needed to be applying topical cream and Vaseline to keep the site clean and moist.  It also looks a bit ugly; the building scar tissue is very red and tender, and with the Vaseline over it, looks slick and shiny. So I get on this flight; I have the window seat and I put on my headphones and drift off to sleep when the plane is still boarding. I wake up to this kid, maybe 4 years old, sat next to me, throwing a tantrum. I didn't catch the first part of it and I honestly couldn't understand what he was yelling about...  His father said to me, Can you cover that injury?  I said that my dermatologist recommends I don't, so no I don't think I will.  He started snapping at me saying there is no need to be so rude. That injury is graphic and it's scaring my little one. I said this is my face. The only damn face I've got. It sucks being told I'm so ugly I can't show my goddamn face in public. He started to backtrack saying just until it's healed and I said it'll always be with me. Maybe teach some fucking compassion and respect instead of telling a girl half your damn age what you think about her face. That's rude.  He actually got up after that and I think went to a stewardess about a seat change because a young couple came to sit next to me on a few minutes instead. I've gotta admit I felt so low that I put on my sunglasses and had a quiet cry for a few minutes. AITA for not covering my healing scar, and for being confrontational about it?",

That's how I met my now fianc\u00e9 (37M) tho he was never my client. We began to date when I was 25 and three or four months after that his BIL ''exposed me'' (no idea how he found out) because *there's no way my fianc\u00e9 knew* and thus we had to come clean in front of his whole family. Yes I did that. Yes he knows. Yes he doesn't care. It was 2 years ago (at that time), we got over it. After that there was a span of 3-4 months in were my MIL and some of my fianc\u00e9s aunts and cousin ''police'' their husband when I was around, it was really weird tbh because this dudes were like 40-60yo and I wasn't that desperate, so my fianc\u00e9 shut their bullshit hard and even when his family still gives me the side eye from time to time, we thought it was behind us. He proposed last year and five months ago we found out that I was pregnant, we were really happy about it and we told his family as soon as we knew. His sisters and young brother were happy for us, but his mom took me aside and *begged* me to be honest with her and asked if this was really my fianc\u00e9s child, I was taken aback but I just rolled my eyes and said yes, she gave me some shitty speech about how ''she only wanted to make sure'' and that ''she was happy to be a grandmother''. Well, last weekend we were at his parents with his family and some of his friendsand we were talking about the name, how he might look (small talk, we will love him regardless but there's always some ''*Oh I hope he gets your nose!*'' ''*mmh I like your eyes, I hope he gets them*'' comments) and my FIL said that he and his children have a birthmark in the inner tight and that even his grandchildren (one of my SIL's kids) got them, so our baby might too, and then he said ''But how can we know from who he got it? it may as well be from me, my boy or my brothers'' and he and his brothers began to laugh. My fianc\u00e9 got mad and before he could say anything I said ''I don't get it'' and my FIL was ''yeah because it runs in the family'' and I said again ''I don't get it, why would he get it from you?'' and he began to get nervous and said ''because you know... it's just a joke OP'' and I said ''but I don't get it and you all laughed, explain'' it got to the point that some of his friends said ''hey, it's not funny'' so he he excused himself and left.  Later my fianc\u00e9's BIL came to me and said that I was wrong for embarrassing him like that in his own house and that I knew what the joke was about and *because of my past*, I shouldn't be surprised. Now they're all demanding that I apologize to my FIL.",

She kept telling me she was getting less and less sleep and kept acting aggressive, blaming lack of sleep from the cats, and that if I didn\u2019t get rid of them, she\u2019d leave me. I legitimately started considering giving the cats to my sister, until I noticed something. One morning she claimed she had gotten up multiple times throughout the night to help the cats. She listed a bunch of times. I thought it was weird, because I had been up until 4am, and she claimed that she \u201cgot up at 1am to open the door for them, and a few times around 3am because they were meowing and jumping on her.\u201d I was in the bedroom the entire time while she slept, and I know none of that happened. Things weren\u2019t adding up, so I decided to run a test. I waited until she said she was going to bed, then I let the cats out of our bedroom, lowered my phone brightness, and faked going to sleep. I just laid there in bed for the entire night, bored, but I definately did not fall asleep. I made sure to make timestamps every 30 minutes on my phone through Discord just to be sure. I marked down every noise my cats made. One cat had jumped down from something and made a little sound at 3:18am, and one ate food relatively quietly by the bedroom door at 4:57am. Other than that, nothing happened. Sure enough, my wife slept from 11pm until 9am, and that morning she claimed she had woken up \u201cat least 7 times\u201d to open doors and from cat noises and cats jumping on her. At this point I was pissed because she was clearly lying to me. I was exhausted and fed up with the lies, so I just bluntly called her out on it. I told her, \u201cThat\u2019s funny. I stayed up all night to monitor the cats, and they weren\u2019t even in the room at all last night. I have timestamps and everything. So you\u2019ve been ***lying*** to me and trying to convince me to get rid of my cats? Why?\u201d She just sat there quitly shaking and looking pissed, then got up and left without answering. She came back hours later and ignored me whenever I talked, and when I asked her how **I\u2019m** the bad-guy in this situation, **she finally said that I was treating her like a child by lying about sleeping and staying up all night just to see if she was lying or not** and that making timestamps and everything as if I was an investigator was \u201cgoing too far\u201d and makes me an obsessive asshole. I did it because she was threatening to make me get rid of my cats or she\u2019d leave me, and her claims didn\u2019t add up. So, am I an \u201cobsessive asshole?\u201d **UPDATE:** My wife has been Baker Acted. She did not hurt herself, just said something concerning in public. I got a call from the hospital this morning, asking me to head over for some \u201cfamily therapy.\u201d Apparently she finally wanted to talk. I\u2019ll be honest, I\u2019m pretty pissed at the reason why she\u2019s been so hateful towards my cats. It\u2019s absolutely asinine. It\u2019s nothing that anyone had suggested. *She\u2019s not cheating. She\u2019s not sick physically or mentally. She\u2019s not bored of the relationship and looking for an \u201cout.\u201d* According to her, ***one of the cats stepped on her laptop and ruined a story she was writing.*** She\u2019s hated both cats ever since. I mean that sucks, but it\u2019s not worth trying to emotionally blackmail me into getting rid of them. I asked her why she didn\u2019t just tell me the truth and why she\u2019d been lying and refused to talk about it when I\u2019d asked. Her answer was \u201cBecause you wouldn\u2019t have gotten rid of them otherwise.\u201d and explained that when she saw I wasn\u2019t willing to abandon them for her, she took offense and made it a \u201cgoal\u201d to have me pick her over them. Sickening. Don\u2019t know why she actually admitted to it all. The woman with us asked me how I felt about all of it, and I just told the truth. I told her it was a nice run, but I\u2019m ***probably*** going to want a divorce. I was asked why, and I told them. I\u2019ve seen a new hateful, malicious side of her that I want nothing to do with. She was so set on getting rid of the cats over a *fanfiction* being ruined that she manipulated her husband. My wife started shouting at me that I\u2019ve betrayed her and that I\u2019m \u201cscum\u201d for choosing animals over her. At least cats don\u2019t give ultimatums like she gave. It sucks that she\u2019s been Baker Acted and all I guess, but it\u2019s for the best right now. She\u2019ll have time to process it all in a safe environment and hopefully come to terms with it. Bad husband, I know. I\u2019m almost sure I\u2019m going for divorce. I\u2019m very worried about having her in the same house as my cats. I want my cats safe. I don\u2019t want to worry about them being harmed or \u201cdisappearing.\u201d Screw that. I guess I\u2019ll do what almost all of you suggested: \u201cKeep the cats, rehome the wife.\u201d Not how I *wanted* it to end, but life isn\u2019t always nice. **If I may, I want to clear up some things from the original post:** ***I did not stare at her all night.*** We have a mute TV with subtitles playing every night. I subtly watched TV while paying attention to the cat sounds. ***I\u2019m not allowed to install cat doors, and she won\u2019t let me keep the doors open.*** Apartment rules. ***Why did I instantly assume she was lying?*** I\u2019m unfamiliar with mental health/diseases. I know about some diseases, but ones that make you think your dreams happened? Tumors that make you see/hear/remember nonexistent things? Sorry that I wasn\u2019t aware of those possibilities. So when someone tells me events happened when they literally didn\u2019t, I generally assume they\u2019re lying. Shame on me. ***If you want even more context/questions answered, simply go through my comment history.***",

He seems very nervous around my daughter and has admitted in a passing comment here and there to my wife and I that he can\u2019t believe she agreed to date him and he thinks she\u2019s way out of his league. He seems very respectful, just shy.   My wife is usually an independent, awesome woman and her ideals align closely with mine particularly in term of feminism and equality. We have both striven to raise our daughter to be as independent and capable as possible.  Since my daughter has been dating this kid my wife has changed considerably and has given our daughter advice that has left me with raised brows more than once.  Some of the advice I\u2019ve heard my wife give is \u2018oh it\u2019s cute for boys to pay for everything, especially in your first relationship!\u2019 Or \u2018oh honey don\u2019t worry about that, he can pay for you, if he really liked you he would\u2019 and similar.  I\u2019ve tried to balance this out by telling my daughter straight away \u2018two people in a partnership should be contributing equally\u2019 and my personal favorite \u2018if someone asks if they can *take you out* to dinner, it\u2019s reasonable to expect them to pay, but if someone asks you to grab dinner with them, it\u2019s reasonable to split the payment\u2019. I figured that would be an easy way for a young person to understand the difference.  However I\u2019ve noticed my daughter becoming more and more entitled with her boyfriends money. They haven\u2019t been anywhere obviously since we\u2019re home but the way she talks about him \u2018oh I\u2019ll just ask him to pay for x\u2019 etc leaves a bad taste in my mouth. She has also flippantly bragged/ mentioned that she gets him to buy gift cards for her etc by mentioning her mother\u2019s advice, i.e. \u2018if you really liked me you\u2019d pay for x\u2019  I spoke to my wife privately and told her my concerns, she insists it\u2019s a rite of passage for girls and it\u2019s cute that she should feel a guy is completely spoiling her. I told her that it\u2019s not cute for her to be thinking it\u2019s acceptable to view relationships as personal ATMS, and my wife became very angry with me and is now calling me an asshole with a lot of hostility.",

A week ago I was going to a conference by plane and because I was going alone (usually when I fly with my boyfriend I don't buy two since he sits next to me) I bought two seats. I fit in one but my side is usually touching the person next to me and I feel uncomfortable for them. It happened to me that they gave me nasty looks and I felt extremely uncomfortable the whole flight.  So I sat down in the plane and put the armrest up so I would be really comfortable. Some couple came and they both sat next to me because they got separate seats and they noticed the seat next to me was empty. Exactly what I was afraid of happened. My side kept touching the guy next to me and he even pushed me a bit when he moved in the seat. I was feeling extremely uncomfortable and asked him if he could go to his seat because I bought this one for my comfort. He told me no, since the seat is empty and he wants to be with his girlfriend. Well, I told him I understand but I feel uncomfortable and I paid for the second seat so exactly this doesn't happen. He refused again and started to chat with his GF. I called the flight attendant and quietly told her what is happening. She asked the guy to leave my second seat and he and his GF gave me a nasty look. The GF mumbled something like Fucking fat bitch under her breath but nothing directly to me.  So Am I the asshole for insisting on him to leave?",

Today gf was taking her daughter on a special outing because she passed a math test, and my dad suggested I go with them for a girls day out.

On our way back home gf stopped at the Starbucks cause daughter wanted a drink and some cakepops. She ordered a drink for her and her daughter and 2 cake pops. I asked her if I could get something and she said she ran out of money and she'd get me something next time. When they got their order I asked if I could have one of the cakepops and gf said that it was her daughter's treat for hard work and it would be wrong for me to take one since I didn't do anything that deserved being rewarded. I'm not gonna lie, I was pretty upset. When we got back home my dad saw their drinks and asked where mine was. I told him that I wasn't allowed to get one cause I don't deserve it. His gf got upset and said I was twisting her words and the daughter just said I was being greedy and was jealous of her. I know I'm not entitled to a drink or a cakepop but I also don't think it's wrong to be a little annoyed. AITA?",

        "selftext": "Hi all.  I gave birth four weeks ago, and we decided to have a ''baby ceremony'', where everyone gets to meet our lovely daughter Charlotte.  My cousin Alice and her parents were among the guests. The first thing I'll say about her is that she has expensive taste. She's the sort of person who has a *minimum* price range for how much she spends on clothing. She doesn't own anything that isn't designer and has some items of clothing that cost thousands. She is a banker and still lives with parents so can afford the lifestyle.  It was Alice's turn to hold the baby and she was happy to at first, but suddenly Charlotte vomited on her. Alice handed Charlotte back to me and ran off crying, and spent the rest of the event crying in the car. I went to see her to apologise but she didn't want to hear any of it. My mum gave her one of her shirts which was too big for her and she felt completely upset and humiliated. Today I got a call from my mum, saying that she'd been on the phone to her sister (Alice's mum) saying that they want me to reimburse the cost of the blouse (roughly \u00a31800) since it was completely ruined.  I have said no. At the end of the day we all know what babies can be like. She took a risk wearing something so expensive knowing a baby was nearby and unfortunately it backfired. I feel bad for her but it was not my fault.  Am I doing the right thing by refusing to pay up?",

I never expected ever in my life that I'd be a mother to triplets so when I first became pregnant it was definitely the last thing in my mind.  I'm home with my babies all day long and had to even transfer my education to online.  Sometimes I just need some fresh air especially when I can't get them to stop crying and I find myself getting super frustrated to the point of tears, it's honestly soo hard and the dad isn't here to help as he's ether at work or at school.My fiance's (24) parents rented us a main floor apartment so when I step outside I'm literally just sitting on the chair right beside the door plus I have a baby monitor step up in their room and it has a camera on it I can literally see them and hear them so if anything happened I'd be able to quickly get to them.  Being able to step outside for a few minutes to take a breather is really important to me because I start to have mini panic attacks when I can't get them to stop crying and I get really frustrated because I just feel super overwhelmed, Being able to go outside just gives me a chance to clam down.  My fiance came home to me sitting outside while the babies were crying and freaked out on me calling me a horrible mom and a bunch of other names that I'm not gonna list here. He thinks that I was being super neglectful and putting the babies in harm way and even told his parents and now everyone seem to be really against me.  I grow up in the system my fiance's family is the only family I have and ever known so it breaks my hurt that they are so upset with me but I really don't think I was doing anything wrong or putting my babies in harm way but they seems to think otherwise. So here I am wondering if I should apologize for my actions or if I am the A-hole in this situation. ~~~~~~~~~ Update ~~~~~~~~~ I decided to show my fiance this thread at first he was really upset with me for sharing our personal problems with strangers on the internet even though it's anonymous.  But in the end when he had a chance to clam down and hear me and all of you guys out he actually apologized and promised me he'd be more involved with parenting and even is willing to take parenting classes which I'll hold him to that.  I just wanna thank everyone for the support that you all give me it brought tears to my eyes (happy tears) seeing how supportive you all were to a stranger on the internet I don't think I ever received this much support before.  I can't believe how much attention this post even got plus the award again thank you so much.",

        "selftext": " My fiance (31 male) and I (25 female) are getting married soon. There wasn't much that disagreed on during the wedding planning except for food. Me and my family are vegans, and there so many reasons why we chose this lifestyle and one of them being that we have a history of health issues. My fiance and his family are the complete opposite. they're hardcore meat eaters which is fine by me obviously. However, When deciding on the wedding food menu, I wanted to add 4-5 vegan options. My fiance and his mom objected saying it was a waste of money over food that 'isn't real food'. They also argued that this would be offensive for 'their' guests and suggested my vegan options just be the good ol' salads & appetizers (his mom wanted cupcakes lol). I said no because for one it's me and my family who's paying. and two I want to make my guests feel welcome and not be treated as second class citizens by being served salad. my fiance made a face and said isn't that what vegans eat?. I refused to argue about it and said it was final. The other day, I found out that he had cancelled all the vegan options and took them off the menu completely and behind my back. I was seething. I called him at work but he kept hanging up on me. I went straight to his workplace and confronted him there and just flipped out on him. He was stunned to see me. He at first said it was his mom's idea then told me to go home because I was making a scene at the office. the fight continued at home and he defended himself by saying that I sort of made him resort to doing this after I kept brushing off his thoughs and input, and refusing to accommadate his family. but there were PLENTY of meat options why why can't I get 4-5 vegan options? when I'm paying for it?. He yelled that it was his wedding too not my family's. My family said it was fine and they'll figure it out and told me to let it go but I refused. AITA for putting my foot down on this? UPDATE: So his mom messaged me earlier to try to get me to listen to what she had to say after I kept ignoring her phonecalls. She spent long walls of text just to address what I did at her son's workplace, calling it all kinds of stuff from immature to unhinged. She then went to explain how she's noticed that me and my family kept acting dismissive of her son's input and contributations to the wedding. She said that she noticed my behavior towards him and her entire family and wanted to speak up earlier but didn't and tried to keep the peace. She then went on to address the food menu issue and denied her involvement in the cancellation of the vegan option but that didn't mean she doesn't support her son's decision. moreover, she thought it was soooo responsible of him to make that move because of my continual refusal to see how this stuff is waste of money. she also pointed out how I kept saying I paid for it and said that technically this isn't just my money, it's mine and *his* because we're getting married she suggested I wisen up and get rid of my money, I paid for it mentality. She finally mentioned how bad this whole situation is making me look, and said that she and her son had already offered a number of compromises that I chose to brush off and decided to make it my weird hill to die on. She said that not only her son is upset but she and the family are as well after hearing about it and suggested I just agrre on their compromise and be done with it. This pissed me off beyond belief I responded by letting her know that I'm still standing my ground on this even if I'll have to call the whole wedding off because of it because honestly? this is just ridiculous, it is!!! my mom and dad....they don't even know what to say anymore. Apparently, my fiance saw my response to her (he's with her) and is now trying to call me but right now I'm waiting on him to get home and see if he's still insisting on the stance he took.

He was gone for hours and I was worried sick until my buddy came to my house and returned him, saying he found him 2 blocks from my house. I asked my girlfriend how my cat, who has never tried to go out before ended up that far from my house and she admitted to kicking him out. I was furious, saying she had no right to kick him out and told her that since she thought she had the power to kick my cat out, I wanted her out of my house by the end of the month. She cried that she had nowhere to go and that she would have to live on the streets. I said I didn't care and told her to leave by the end of the month. My friends think I'm being too harsh, but my cat could have died because of her and I don't want her trying anything else. AITA?",

        "selftext": "I (46M) live with my wife and my 17 year old son. My wife has been on a different continent for about a month taking care of her dying mother, so it has just been me and my son for that time. My son and I have a very close relationship where he tells me almost everything going on in his life. On Saturday, he told me that he was going to his first ever high school party this upcoming weekend. He was a bit nervous since he had never really drank before, but he knew that he was going to on that occasion. I'm not sure if this is relevant, but this is in Canada where the drinking age is 19 (in my province), and teenage drinking is very common. I asked my son if he wanted to have a few beers with me while we watched a sports game that night, as a test run of sorts. My logic was that if he goes into the party with zero awareness of his tolerance then it could end badly, and it would be best for him to find out his limit in the safety of his home with me. We had some beers over a few hours in the night, and I cut him off at 6 (he has had beer in the past, but never more than one at a time). He was pretty drunk but he was okay, and slept it off. We talked about it the next day, and we agreed that six was a bit much for him, and now he knows to have fewer than that at the party. I was actually pretty content with this whole situation, since he had his first experience drinking in a safe environment, and I feel much more comfortable with him going to a party now. However, in an effort to be transparent I told my wife about it the other day over the phone, and she was livid. She thinks it was reckless and irresponsible. AITA? INFO: I understandably am getting flack for not telling my wife beforehand, but I figured she had enough going on and I didn't need to bother her with something that seemed pretty trivial at the time EDIT: Thanks for all the comments, I am reading every single one! I appreciate the different perspectives",

        "selftext": "I am a hiring manager at a tech company and I was hiring for summer internships a little while ago. We had a guy, about 19 years old, applying for a summer internship between his freshman and sophomore years of college. It was a virtual interview over Zoom because of covid.  A minute or two in, when I was introducing myself, his mom came in and introduced herself and started talking about her son's work ethic. I thought it was a little strange. I said something polite about wanting to hear from him. She just didn't get the hint and kept coming into camera frame during the interview and interrupting her son to answer questions for him. I asked a few technical questions which he seemed to answer well and then cut the interview fairly short. I thought that was all over and done with until I'd gotten an email from a woman, a month later, asking about her son's application, she seemed offended he hadn't gotten an acceptance or rejection.  It bothered me, I felt bad for the kid honestly. Wayyy back when I was a teenager, my mom used to pull the same shit, but luckily she only did that when I was 15 and working for a day-camp, not when I was an adult applying for engineering jobs. But I felt like this poor kid was getting his chances ruined because his mom wasn't giving him the chance to apply on his own. I sent an email back saying I was not at liberty to send information about an application to anybody but the applicant. I also asked HR to send an email to the kid saying sorry but we were not making him an offer. (It is something we usually do, but his rejection email must have slipped through the cracks with all the Covid craziness.) Anyway, after we sent that, I got a phone call from his mom, she had a forwarded copy of the email, and she was demanding answers. I said that I could not comment on the guy's performance in the interview to her as she was not the applicant. If he wanted to reach out to me I was happy to give him some feedback.  However, I could say that regardless of his performance, her presence in the interview took him out of consideration for the position. We were looking for an independent and self-driven person for the position, and for that reason, it is important to see an applicant speak for themselves, follow-up themselves, etc. I also said that, as a piece of advice, every hiring manager I've met in my career who sees someone other than the applicant answering questions during an interview, following up on the applicant's behalf, etc... Would also put their resume in the do not hire pile. Since, while the applicant may be skilled and motivated, they need the ability to demonstrate those traits themselves.  She fucking blew up at me over that, kinda cussing me out to the point where I hung up. AITA for how I handled this? Maybe I should have kept my mouth shut way earlier",

        "selftext": "  I f32 gave birth to my son 5 weeks ago. My husband's mom has been camping in the living room ever since and inviting people over, making a mess in the house, etc. I said nothing because if I open my mouth, my husband would start scolding me saying his mom is there to help and I should be grateful. What I did was ignore her and focus on my son. I handle feeding, diaper change, cleaning, wiping. I only get a few hours sleep so my husband's mom isn't really helping with the baby. But I thought to myself well, at least she cooks for us!. Last night, I was in the bedroom breastfeeding my son. I knew I was late for dinner but I thought that my husband and his mom saved a plate for me. Once I got done with my son, I walked out the room and saw my husband and his mom sitting watching tv. I asked about dinner and my husband said it was probably on the stove. As I was walking towards the kitchen, his mom loudly said that she didn't save me any food. I was absolutely shocked I asked her why and she simply said Well, we didn't see you at dinner table so I thought you weren't hungry. I lost it and yelled that I was feeding my son OF COURSE I was hungry, I was actually starving!. She shrugged her shoulders and said it wasn't her fault I didn't show up for dinner but she knew damn well that I was with my son and hadn't eaten a thing in hours!. My husband asked me to not raise my voice at his mom but I told him that he saw what happened and didn't think about me being hungry and needing food. he lashed out asking what the fuck I wanted him to do and I said I don't know, maybe save some food for me? She defended him saying it was selfish of me to basically berate him for eating his dinner after working for long hours at the department. An argument ensued and I went inside the bedroom, packed a small bag for me and my son, called my brother to come take me to mom's house and my husband blew up at me as I was making my way out. We argued at the door and he told me that what I was doing was uncalled for and childish. I told him I couldn't take his mom anymore, he said I should be ashamed of myself for talking about her like that after she literally put her life on pause so she could help ME out. My brother came and I got into the car and left. He picked some food for me on the way and I ate like a hungry bear. My husband never stopped calling though. In his last text he called me nuts and demanded I return today but I said that I miss my mom, that I like it here in her clean home with her healthy food and would like to stay for a while. He's lost it and got his family involved accusing me of keeping his son away from him and punishing him over food.  **Edit...Ok, to those who are saying that I'm keeping my husband away from his son, I promise you that he has full access to him but chooses not to come over simply because he hats my mom and refuses to be with her in the same room. How long am I going to stay here??? There's no telling but at least I'm being pampered and treated like a princess by my mom, dad, brothers - heck, I couldn't get this treatment in my own home!. As for my husband, He can come over to mom's house if he wants to see his son so badly but I doubt he'll do it since he's a very prideful person and this might hurt his ego.** **one more question to answer cause a lot of people asked me to clarify. Yes, Department = Police Department. He's a police officer. I'm sorry if you got confused, but I thought it was clear.**    **Edit Ok, I felt sorry for him and decided to send him a couple of pictures that I took of our son sleeping and what was his respons? A long wall of text berating me left and right and claiming that I was rubbing it in his face that he can't come see his son because of you know what!!. He called me the b word which he never did til now and I'm shaken and so so mad right now because I really thought I was doing something nice and considerate after having sympathy for him. I've decided to get the rest of my stuff tomorrow because I need more time and space to be able to think about what he's done and said. I feel terrible right now but at least I got dinner for tonight, unlike when I was at my own home when his mom first came** **Edit. OH MY GOD, I can't even find a place to start with this. So he just sent me a picture of him and his mom cooking dinner in the kitchen (it's nearly 7 pm here) saying that he was repaying me for the pictures I sent earlier and that they were making dinner and they were not including me for real this time ?????? I just....Oh my God I'm literally laughing like, seriously, what is this? I'm truly speechless!. I haven't responded to this (yet) and I don't think I will because I'm so angry right now and may just regret the words that I say to him. I'm gonna put the phone on silent or something for now because I don't want them to ruin yet another night but tomorrow I'm going to collect more of mine and my son's stuff so I could stay longer at my mom's house. Thank God I went anonymous with this and I might update later if anything new happens. Goodnight!** **Edit. God I can't believe I'm back on here, but he just sent me a text saying he's only willing to come over IF I could get mom out of the house tomorrow, like literally have her leave her own house! He said it's just for 2 hours so he could see his son and also talk (he doesn't even know I'm coming over tomorrow to pick more stuff for me and the baby). I'm freaking out! Like absolutely no, not happening. I wouldn't dream of telling mom to leave her own house, that's crazy out of line request!!!. I'm not sure wether to respond or what I should say to him but I'll try to get some sleep then see how it goes in the morning!. I'm too tired to do anything but I Just wanted to put this here for those who just read my thread, I'll let you know what happens tomorrow. Aright!.**",

        "selftext": "I\u2019m going to be vague for privacy reasons, sorry.   I (33F) am the breadwinner of our household. I have multiple, highly specialized degrees for a niche industry. I make 200k+, with potential to get in the 600-M\u2019s range. My company has not been hit that badly by COVID, so most of us have kept our jobs, but we\u2019re held to strict standards.   My husband (36M) has a broad degree/work experience. He quit his job right before COVID hit, hoping for a better job in the meantime, and I was supportive. He spent a ton of time applying to various jobs, and finally landed an interview at Organization X.  This is his dream job, in almost every imaginable way (I can\u2019t be detailed). However, it\u2019s paying about 65k a year, which would be fine except this job directly puts my job stability at risk.  My company and this org. are adversarial, at best. My field is extremely secretive, and if clients discovered my spouse was working for a competitor, I would be permanently tainted. I wouldn\u2019t be able to get a job in the industry forever. I know this sounds like an exaggeration, but I promise you, it absolutely is not. It\u2019d be like if I worked in protecting the privacy of celebrities, and he worked for TMZ. If he tapped my car, got into my work devices, he could use that to advance his career, and any trust I have in this field will be gone. Even if I trusted my husband not to do that, my clients and company don\u2019t. Worse, b/c my background is so specialized, this is the only field I can work in.  I asked him to drop from consideration for this job, since if he got it, we\u2019d lose my income. 65k a year cannot support us in this city. Plus, he does not have to work for this organization. Even if the job market is awful right now, his background gives him access to a wide range of jobs, but I only have this one, niche field.  He was extremely angry, and said I was \u201cselfish and only cared about money.\u201d I told him that if he wanted to go back to school for an advanced degree or just be unemployed for a while, I would support him, but taking this job isn\u2019t possible.  He continued the process behind my back, and got the offer. He wants to accept it, b/c he says his career needs to take priority and that I wasn\u2019t being a supportive wife.  I feel so betrayed, and I\u2019ve contacted all relevant higher ups in my company to inform them. I notified them as soon as he got the interview, b/c it\u2019s better coming from my email than from a background check.  I told him he could decline the offer, w/me watching him physically decline it, or he could accept the offer and move out immediately. I would pay for him to stay two weeks at a hotel, and we would begin divorce proceedings. My company is willing to take care of all of my legal fees.  I feel fucking awful. I still love him. I moved decisively, b/c this was the best way to cut my losses, but it still hurts. He called me heartless and cold. It\u2019s true that I was prioritizing my career over his, but it felt like the only option at the time.",

        "selftext": "For some weird reason my MIL really wants to go into our bedroom whenever she comes over.  On one occasion I followed her as she went upstairs (i was going to get something for my child as the bedrooms are upstairs) and she walked past the bathroom on the main floor and up the stairs behind it.  She didn\u2019t hear me and I caught her walking straight into my room and rifling through bills on my dresser.  She denied snooping (even though I\u2019d just watched her do it) and said she was just going to use our bathroom because she couldn\u2019t find the other ones. She walked right past the one on the main floor and another one in the upstairs hallway to go into our bedroom. Since that happened, I installed an exterior doorknob that requires a key on our bedroom door and one on the door to our office/spare bedroom.  However, she\u2019s still always \u201cforgetting\u201d where the bathroom is and trying the bedroom and office door.  This really ticks me off.  My husband says that I just get annoyed at this because everything she does drives me crazy and since we\u2019ve put locks on the rooms we don\u2019t want her in, there isn\u2019t really a problem anymore.   Well over the holidays we had my in laws over for dinner and before they came I was searching for the bedroom keys. We hadn\u2019t used them in a while since we only lock the doors when MIL comes over.  My husband told me we didn\u2019t need to lock the doors since she wouldn\u2019t try to get into the rooms and I insisted that she would because she loves to snoop.  We went back and forth and decided to cover the doorknobs in super fine glitter to see if she tried them.   I did this once before when husband didn\u2019t believe me about the snooping to prove she\u2019d been in the rooms.  Last time she ignored the glitter and we didn\u2019t say anything about it but then my husband couldn\u2019t deny that she\u2019d tried to snoop.  So this time I covered the knobs in glitter and for the office went a touch further and rigged a little folder of glitter over the door to the office before the in laws came over.  I left it one side unlocked (French doors) and it was set so if you walked in the room you would get covered in glitter.  Husband goes out of his way to show his mom the main floor bathroom when they got here and specifically asks his parents and sister not to go upstairs.  There\u2019s a  baby gate so the kids can\u2019t get upstairs either.  Well guess who had to go to the bathroom and got covered in glitter and had it all over their hands and hair?  She completely lost it and started screaming at me so I yelled back and now my husband is saying I went too far and I\u2019m the asshole.  MIL also says I\u2019m the asshole but SIL says I didn\u2019t do anything wrong and MIL deserved it for snooping.  FIL is Switzerland.  Apparently her car is ruined now too because it\u2019s covered in glitter that she cant get cleaned up. So AITA? ETA: I can\u2019t believe this blew up and I wanted to say thank you for all the support and the awards!  My husband woke up and found this post and I think the comments have been an eye opener.  We are going to start couple\u2019s therapy in January so I think that will be great for us.   I will be ordering some cellulose glitter that is biodegradable and safer for future projects.   And if she comes over again I will set up a camera haha or at least print out some fun fake documents so if she snoops again she can at least find something interesting :)",

I'm not his supervisor, but I'm definitely a senior employee. I'll call the guy Ted Faro, because he's a dick. \u200b Supervisor was going around introducing Ted to people, and when he got to me said This is John and described my job. \u200b Ted: Hi, Jack. Me: It's John. \u200bTed: What?\u200b Me: My name's John, not Jack. Ted: It's close enough for me. Supervisor: His name's John, not Jack. Let's move on. \u200b This continued for a few months. Despite reminders from supervisors (when he referred to me when I wasn't present) and myself, he continued to use the name Jack. I finally told him You either use my name, or I ignore you completely, no matter what the situation is. \u200b His response was Sure thing, Jackie boy. \u200b Since I don't work directly with him, I figured screw it and that I'd ignore him. \u200b Recently he had a 2-day business trip that required car rental. I work late some nights, and Ted came to me and says Hey, Jack, I'll be dropping the rental car off at 7 when I get back. See you there for a lift back to the office! \u200b (they closed at 6 and there's a drop box) \u200b As promised, I ignored him. \u200b 7:15 rolls around on the night he's dropping off and I get a call. I recognize his number, so I ignored it. He called 7 more times, then starts e-mailing. The first one was along the lines of Jack I'm at Enterprise. Come pick me up. E-mails pour in every 5-10 minutes, addressing me as Jack, Jack-o, Jackie, and Jackie-boy. The emails also started being laced with profanity and a couple threats. \u200b I signed out and went home. It was raining hard. Next morning, I saw that Ted had sent a few more e-mails. I printed them off. At 10am, he storms up to my desk and  screams Where the [f-bomb] were you? I told you when to pick me up! I HAD TO TAKE A CAB! DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH THAT COST ME?! He goes on like that for a bit until his supervisor came and hauled him away and asked to speak to me. \u200b Supervisor: Ted tells me that you ignored his requests for a pickup when he dropped off the rental. He was caught out in the rain. \u200b I relayed what happened, and showed him the printed e-mails. I'd highlighted the threats. Supervisor: I can see why you wouldn't want to spend time around him. But it was still kind of inconsiderate to leave him stranded in the rain. That's not the greatest neighborhood and he could have been hurt. he sighed and said With the threats and him being on probation, he no longer works here. Just try not to be an a-hole in retaliation to your coworkers. \u200b A few people at the office have commented that I'm the jerk for ignoring Ted and getting him riled up, which got him fired. \u200b *AM* I the a-hole on this?",

        "selftext": "A few nights ago, I hosted a game night for a small group of friends (we had all been quarantining and following the proper guidelines in my county). It was only going to be 5 of us (including me), but one of my friends texted me last minute that she was going to bring a coworker from work (Matt-fake name). Fine with me. We started playing a card game where you answer questions about yourself; based on the level (Level 1, 2, 3), the question could be extremely surface level (ex. what's your favorite color?) to something deeper (ex. what characteristic of yourself do you not like about yourself?). Everyone was enjoying themselves, and I was happy with the way things were going. Cue a question I drew: What's the hardest thing you've ever had to go through? Some backstory: My sister passed away a few years ago when I was still in high school. I was pulled out of class and flew immediately to her college and watched her die in the ICU. Needless to say, this is probably the hardest thing I've been through. 3 of my friends in the group knew about this, the other 2 and Matt did not. I didn't want to bring the mood down, so I answered that the hardest thing I'd been through was transitioning going to a college in a different state where I knew no one. We were all ready to move on, but Matt immediately piped up and said, Wow, if that's the hardest thing you've ever been through, you live an extremely privileged life.  Everyone got quiet. Now, if he had said it jokingly, I probably would have let it go and moved on. However, the way he said it was in a very condescending and patronizing tone, and I will admit, it rubbed me the wrong way. Instead of letting it go, I said well, the hardest thing I've ever been through is seeing my sister die in the ICU and having to watch her being lowered into her grave when I was 17. I just didn't want to bring the mood down. If things were quiet before, they were dead silent now. Matt mumbled an apology but game night ended shortly after. After my friends all left, my friend who had brought Matt texted me and told me I was a jerk for making Matt look bad, and I could have just let his statement go. I do feel bad about what I said and being the cause of game night ending so soon, but I also feel like I was just making a justified statement. AITA?",

        "selftext": "I was raised mostly by my uncle and aunt.  My older sister developed a serious illness when I was 6 and my parents decided that they couldn\u2019t care for both of us I guess, so they kind of unceremoniously dumped me at my grandparents and my uncle took me in. Like, didn\u2019t even explain to me what was going on, just \u201cyou\u2019re going to go visit gran for awhile\u201d and never picked me back up.  My grandparents and uncle explained it later, and they were pretty livid at my parents. I\u2019ve seen my parents maybe 5 times since then and not at all for the last 9 years.  I decided to stop having contact with them when I was 12 and since I was the only one reaching out all communication broke down.  It turned out ok, I love my aunt and uncle and it turns out they can\u2019t have kids so they\u2019ve always said I\u2019m their miracle kid, I was just misrouted by the stork at first. I was formally adopted by them when I turned 18, I wish it had been earlier but there were some red tape things that would have made that really expensive and difficult. I\u2019m 21 now. My sister passed away between thanksgiving and Christmas and I made a trip back from school for the funeral, but I stayed in the back and left before my bio parents could talk to me.  They called my uncle to try to talk to me, but I said I didn\u2019t want to so he told them that I wasn\u2019t available at the moment. They finally caught up to me over Christmas when I went to midnight mass with my gran, and approached me and tried to give me a hug.  I did recognize them, but I pretended not to and just backed off and said \u201cSorry, do I know you?\u201d They said \u201cWe\u2019re your parents!\u201d and I said \u201cMy parents are at home.\u201d and went and sat down with my gran. They sat behind us and I could just feel the stare, and on the way out they were like \u201cYou really don\u2019t recognize us?\u201d And I said \u201cOh, are you my dad\u2019s brother? I think I remember you from when I was little.\u201d My gran thinks they deserved it trying to come back to me like nothing happened, but they wrote me a long letter about how hurt they are and how I should understand that they were trying to do the right thing and how they\u2019ll always be my parents and I can\u2019t change that. Other family members think I was too harsh as they\u2019re grieving, but I don\u2019t think they should get a pass just because they remembered me now that my sister is gone.",

        "selftext": "I [20 F] am an older sister to my little (biological) brother (17 M) who finished high school last year. My little brother and I are really close. He says I'm the best friend he has and he loves me more than anyone (of course this is not true, he has many friends of his own). My brother has been asking our step-dad/mother if he could get a new car for his grad party since last year, and he said he'd pay 50-75% with his own hard-earned money while they paid the rest. They said no. I have a car but I had been working for one, they helped me pay off for it. So my brother's arguments with our parents got heated after awhile (one time I told my brother that I'd help him pay off expenses for a good car once I got my own. He hugged me and said I didn't need to worry and that he owed me way more than I owed him). But he continued to press our parents all of last year until they gave in and said yes like they did for me. Note that our step-dad and my brother have a negative relationship for the most part. Our bio mother and step-dad got together soon after our bio dad and mom divorced when we were little. My brother thinks that step-dad and mother were seeing each other before our real parents divorced and tbh, I think that might be true. Not certain, though. Anyway, my step-dad, mother and brother compromised and said they'd get him the car in 2021 so that people don't gawk at him at the graduation party. June this year my brother and step-dad/mother are still on about the car, now the arguments getting loud and lasting hours until evening. My step-dad was getting into screaming matches with my brother over it but they reached a final compromise of the car being bought last week.  The fated morning comes and my brother wakes up to our step-dad and mom guiding him outside to... a car. But not his, our mother's. Step-dad used his and my brother's money on a dumb prank, bought a completely different model of car, and said it was for our mother. Our mom and step dad just laughed and kissed each other. My brother didn't lose it, he didn't even look angry. He just looked dead in our step-dad's eyes and said, and I'm not joking, verbatim: you might think I'm fucking stupid, you might think whatever. But I'm just better than you, bro. You know that, I know that, and our mom is a fucking idiot for staying with a prick like you. But I'll make you wish you'd never fucking met us. I promise you. You might be laughing now, but you'll be crying later. He then walked off, not even looking back at them as they stared horrified. They asked me what was that about and I, feeling terrible for my brother, said they had it coming and not to be surprised. So now they grounded both of us. I've had to explain the situation to my friends as I can't see them anymore but I feel so bad for my baby brother and they back me up on this and ask me to comfort him as much as possible. But our parents are so mad, and they can't see that my brother had his heart crushed. AITA?",

        "selftext": "My fiance M33, and I F28 are getting married in december. His mom is the intrusive type but she's nice overall and we....somewhat get along. I hate to admit that wedding planning has been an absolute nightmare. His mom wasn't willing to agree on most things, and my fiance said that since he's her only son then I should respect and appreciate this vision she has for the wedding and how it should be. She insisted to come along for wedding dress shopping. I took her with me and my mom and friends. I was so lucky to have found what I was looking for. but she picked a dress that she liked so much and said that she always pictured her son's bride in it mom and friends thought this line was creepy. I thought the dress was somewhat creepy and toooootally not my type. I apologized and thanked her for her vision but told her that I'd already decided on a dress that I had envisioned myself wearing at my wedding!. She got all pissy because of it apparently, then must've told my fiance because, he came home in the evening ranting about how I made his mom upset and turned down her help in choosing the wedding dress and excluded her from the process. I asked what process? duh it's just a wedding dress...my wedding dress so I really didn't get how she should get a say at all!. He got upset and said that this attitude of mine isn't working on him or his mom. He said that I should consider the dress his mom wanted me to buy especially knowing that both dresses weren't that much different anyway like she said but I told him yes they were different...like so much different. Anyways, We argued about it then we dropped it. Yesterday I came home and found out that he had returned my wedding dress and replaced it with the one his mom wanted. I called him and he was straightforward about what he did and why he did it. I lost it and started screaming at him. He asked me to calmn down and really give this dress a chance. I refused to even listen I screamed at him without giving him a chance to speak. He got home and we had an argument. I then went to stay with one of my friends and he kept calling and calling then texting saying that I overreacted and it's his wedding too so it wasn't cool how I screamed at him. He insisted I give this dress a chance. He went on and on about how his mom has a vision and good intentions and just wants what best for me as her future daughter inlaw. Mom is livid and has been wanting to go scream at him and his mom but my dad said that this isn't worth ruining my relationship with my inlaws. He suggested I wisen up and go with the flow but is it too much for me to be able to pick my own wedding dress without being guilted about it just to keep the peace?. AITA for my reaction? ETD Q & As I'm editing in some answers to frequent questions I get. A. The dress she picked wasn't all too crazy but just wasn't my type. B. This issue started during wedding planning and there were other things...like way too many things we didn't agree on. but this vision has been there for...quite a while. C. I AM paying for the dress obviously. D. My fiance's dad is deceased. also, his mom suffered from multiple health conditions. Has no daughters but one only son. E. He's still presisting...",

I have not eaten meat since I was roughly 3-4 years old when I found out where meat comes from (spoiler alert: there were a lot of tears). This is no secret and everyone in my life knows and respects this - or so I thought.  Four nights ago, I was at a party and I will admit, I got white girl wasted. My friends thought it would be funny to feed me chicken nuggets as a prank. I checked with them before chowing down are these vegan? To which my friends replied yeah, they're sunfed (a type of vegan chickenless chicken). They tasted off to me but I figured it was just because I was drunk. I was wrong.  I found out the next day when my sister sent me a message telling me to check my friends Snapchat story. The story was them showing the nugget packaging, and then showing them giving them to me (including the conversation where I asked if it was vegan). The and then later them mocking me and pretending to be me when I found out I ate meat (things like fake crying and yelling the CHICKENS!!!). I took a screen recording of the video and took it to the police, on the grounds of food tampering, and now 3 of my (ex) friends are facing charges.  They all think that I'm overreacting to a 'harmless' prank, so Reddit, AITA? In my view, they took advantage of my drunken state, tampered with my food, and publically humiliated me. In their view, it was just a prank.",

        "selftext": "My stepsister (20F) and I (24M) have never gotten along. Her mom and my dad got married when we were six and ten so we've known each other for a long time. In my stepmom's eyes, she could do no wrong and anything bad that happened was pinned on me. My dad is a complete pushover so he would always fall over to whatever my stepmom would say. When I was about 15, I started gaining weight. My gf broke up with me (woohoo high school romance), I started failing some of my classes, and I quit baseball. I started to stress-eat and ballooned up from 125 pounds to 162. I guess at that point she decided she was cooler than I was and started mocking me and making fun of me, calling me names like fatass and chubster. I would constantly go to my stepmom about it and she would tell me she's just teasing, she's so much younger, why are you getting upset? I got pissed off to the point where I just started avoiding her and locking myself upstairs in my room with a bag of chips. At 22 I hit 270 pounds and I knew I had gone too far. I was way past my weight limit and bordering on obese. So as a New Year's resolution, I decided to start losing weight. I cut out all junk food and started hitting the gym. Around this time my stepsister started to overeat too, I don't really know why but she gained over 30 pounds. She still was constantly belittling me about my weight (which admittedly, was way over hers). By the end of this year, I lost 120 lbs. It felt amazing. My stepsister now weighed more than me. Over Christmas dinner, all the aunts and uncles and cousins were complimenting me on my weight loss, telling me how I looked so much better. My stepsister just sat there smoldering. Every time someone said something she'd add, He's still pretty big, Well he didn't get rid of that face roundness, Maybe lose a little more around that gut. It was infuriating and I was getting angrier. Now here's where I might be TA. Finally, at her last little snide, Look, you know you'll just put it all back on. Why do you even bother? I flipped out. I yelled, Why can't you just be happy for me, instead of getting on me for every little thing?She said back to me, Defensive much?  Oh, I'm sorry. Did I hurt your 200-pound feelings? I asked her. I probably should have stopped there but I kept going. Calling me a fatass. Look at your plate! You've eaten half the table, fatty! She started crying and left the table. My stepmom screamed at me, saying just because I was insecure I can't take it out on everyone. I said, Oh, so *now* you're talking. Not in the past ten years of constant 'fatty' and 'lardass' and 'porker'!  But you're way older! she whined. I left the table too and went home. I woke up today to a thousand messages from my stepmom, my dad, and my stepsister. They were saying I wasn't welcome to their house until I apologized. I'm not going to. AITA? EDIT: Thank you so much everyone for your comments and the awards. I've never felt better about myself than now. And yes, I understand that 270 lbs was not bordering on obese. I'm 6'0 so I was pretty damn obese. I called myself bordering for a few years after getting fat, it made me feel better than classifying myself as morbidly obese.",

        "selftext": "Edit: Update. I want to thank you all for the kind words and comments. I knew after reading the comments that it was time to come to a resolution. I decided to drive home from work and talk with Erica. When I showed up Leah\u2019s car was parked in the drive. I went inside and they were watching tv. I told Leah immediately to get out, she tried to argue but I told her if she didn\u2019t then I\u2019m calling the police. Erica tried to get pissy that I kicked her friend out but I said I\u2019m done talking about Leah because at this point nothing is changing with that relationship. Sat Erica down and showed her this post. 20 minutes of reading later I asked her what she thought, she said \u201cthose people don\u2019t understand our relationship or Leah\u201d. I knew then that it was over. I asked her to hold out her hand and I took the ring off. She begged saying she is sorry and she\u2019ll cut Leah off etc. I told her I can\u2019t even trust her with the garage code, how am I supposed to trust her as my wife. She\u2019s locked herself in our room now. I\u2019m in the kitchen packing up her things. I called her dad/mom telling them about what has happened and they were furious. Leah is apparently banned from their house and has been since HS. I didn\u2019t know this but her parents said it\u2019s been like this since Hs. They are coming this weekend to get Erica and the stuff. I couldn\u2019t be any happier than I am right now. A huge weight feels lifted off my shoulders. I felt like if I never made this post I wouldn\u2019t have ever seen how messed up my life had become. Sincerely thank you everyone. Can\u2019t wait to take my clubs out and play a round now that I have more free time. Really excited to see what single life brings and can\u2019t thank you all enough again.   Me (29M) and Erica (27F) dated for 2 years and have been engaged the last 4 months. After we got engaged Erica moved into my house. I still pay the mortgage while she pays for utilities, Groceries and household items. After we get married the plan is to put her on the house so she gets equity as well. Her friend Leah (27F) and her have been best friend since high school. I don\u2019t particularly like Leah but have also been cordial as I know she\u2019s gonna be in my life. My issue is Leah thinks of my home as hers. Couple examples\u2026 She always brings her boyfriend over and he\u2019s a sketchball. She talks to me in a very disrespectful way in my own house, like I\u2019m a guest and she/Erica own it. One day I went out to my garage and some of my tools were missing. I checked my camera and Leah/BF were in my garage with Erica and took some tools with them. I asked Erica and she said they were just borrowing and would return them. I had to reach out multiple times for them to finally return the tools weeks later. I have a nice wine/liquor collection and I was working late one Friday. While working I heard some clanking of bottles together. Erica wasn\u2019t home so I went out to see what was up. Leah was behind my bar. I asked what she was doing and she said that Erica told her it was okay to borrow a bottle of wine for her party and that she would pay it back. I told her no that wasn\u2019t alright and to leave. I asked Erica about this and she said \u201cI don\u2019t remember telling Leah she could take a bottle but I might have I don\u2019t remember\u201d. I told her at this point I wasn\u2019t comfortable with Leah being in my house, Erica sorta understood but also blew me off.  Final straw came when I wanted to go hit some golf balls and my clubs were missing. I freaked out because i golf regularly and my clubs are my biggest investment. Went to check the camera again and Leah used my garage code and took the clubs. I blew up, called Erica and told her to get them back immediately. Erica said Leah had asked for the garage code to grab some clothes from her closet and not my clubs. I threatened to call the police but Erica stopped me. Leah kept telling us that her boyfriend needed them for a work thing. I got them back almost 4 days after they were taken and they were dirty. At this point I sat Erica down and told her that if I see Leah in my house again then I\u2019m calling the cops, no discussion. Erica got upset saying that it\u2019s her best friend and that wasn\u2019t fair to do to her in our house. I said it\u2019s a pattern and since Erica\u2019s stuff isn\u2019t affected she doesn\u2019t care. I said she can go over to Leah\u2019s if she wants to see her. She said she can\u2019t do this because Leah doesn\u2019t like her apartment and Leah\u2019s BF is always there which makes Erica uncomfortable. I\u2019m now getting the silent treatment and getting called an AH but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m doing anything wrong. AITA?",

        "selftext": "So background: I (32f) have a brother, Dave (35m), who's married to Sarah (29f). They don't have children yet. I have a son who just turned four and a three-month-old daughter with my husband (39m). My husband and I live in Belgium most of the time, but we travel back to visit my family about once a month (in England). At home, we speak both English and French to our children (my husband is Belgian), and right now, my son is in this very sweet phase where he'll sometimes mix up the two languages and say a couple of words in English in a French sentence or vice-versa. This has never posed a problem to us, and even the staff at his nursery have reassured us that it's very common and they tend to grow out of it once they start at school. My sister-in-law has decided that this is a problem, so when we're visiting my parents and she notices my son doing this, she'll correct him, but she does so really rudely, whereas my husband and I will just gently correct him. Anyway, we're visiting at the moment and she's now decided that instead of correcting him, she's just going to start ignoring him when he does this. I sort of noticed her doing it when we arrived, and I thought it was odd, but assumed maybe she was just stressed (her job is quite intense), but it only really became an issue yesterday. My husband was talking to my dad outside and I was feeding my daughter in the other room, and I'd left Louis with Sarah and Dave. When I came back downstairs, Louis was crying, and I managed to understand that he'd tried to ask Sarah for a drink (he has a special cup he uses that he was holding, so it was obvious what he meant) but that she'd just ignored him. I asked her why and she explained that she wasn't going to reply to him unless he said the sentence correctly and that I shouldn't be ignoring my son's obvious speech issues. For context, it's not that she didn't know what he wanted. She told me that she understood exactly what he was asking for, but that she was deliberately refusing because he hadn't asked correctly. This really pissed me off, but luckily my husband came inside at that moment and pulled me away so we could calm down and settle Louis. That night at the dinner table, Sarah asked me to pass her something, but she said it in bad English (she IS English, I just mean that she asked for it in slang. Think, Pass *us* the peas, will you. I had a bit of an epiphany and I just decided to totally ignore her. She asked again, and I did the same thing. My brother asked why I was ignoring his wife and I said that I'm not able to reply if she can't speak English correctly and that it's wrong of him to ignore her obvious issues with grammar. Everyone's pretty pissed off with me and I admit it was incredibly childish, but she was needlessly being a dickhead to my baby. Should I just apologise? **Edit: WOW this really blew up. Thanks for all the comments and support, and thanks for all the ESH/YTA messages too. I'm not going to apologise to her, because, to be quite frank, I think she deserved it, but I will have a conversation with her and my brother before we leave to try and explain that, for one thing, it's completely normal, and, more importantly, that if she keeps correcting or ignoring my son, I'll be severely limiting their contact. Although I doubt if I'll ever leave him alone in a room with her again anyway.** **To answer a few of the most common questions: When I said everyone was mad at me, I meant my brother, his wife and my parents (although, my parents don't agree with what Sarah's doing either. They're more trying to keep the peace). My husband is entirely on my side, and when he realised what Sarah had done to Louis (he only saw the aftermath), he wanted to cut short the trip.** **Sarah (and the rest of my family), only speak English, which I suppose goes some way towards explaining why she doesn't understand it. I do think it's a monolingual reaction because we've never experienced anything similar in Belgium.** **One final thing - lots of questions about why we're in the UK so often. My husband has to be in London for his job about once a month/ once every six weeks, so we tag along. I freelance, and a few of my clients are UK based, so it's a good opportunity for me to fit in a few meetings too. It also gives us the chance to bring Louis and Misha over to see my parents before Louis starts school, and we have to cut down on the visits.**",

        "selftext": "My sisters car broke down 6 months ago because of her own stupidity. I won't go into it here but she ignored the advice of a mechanic and because of that her car broke. I decided to be nice and offer my sister my car until she could get hers fixed as i could bike to work while she needed to drive. She did not get her car fixed for some reason. She claimed to be saving money to do so but every time her paycheck came she spent it. My parents have even offered her a loan to fix her car but she refused. Along with all of this, she has been abusing my generosity and taking my car all day and night. I told her she could use it for work but is seems to her that is a free pass to use my car, not fill it with gas, and take it when I specifically tell her not to.  Recently I've been needed to get to work very early and I really don't feel like riding my bike 6 miles at 3 in the morning so I told my sister she had 30 days until I took the spare key from her and she is no longer allowed to use it. That was 32 days ago. Yesterday morning she woke up specifically before me to take my car (at 2:30 in the morning). I called her and demanded she bring it back but she just hung up on me. because of this I reported it stolen.  My sister was arrested 30 minutes later and my parents had to go bail her out. My sister is now facing charges for unauthorized use of a car and my parents and her are pissed. They claim I want way to far here but honestly, i feel justified. My parents are worried if she's found guilty she will loose her job but in my opinion, it's her own fault. Am i wrong here? Am i an asshole?",

        "selftext": " So, I'm getting married to my fiance soon. I bought my wedding dress weeks ago. His my (FMIL) kept pestering me about trying it on but I firmly refused. I finally shut it down after she offered me 100$ to let her try it on. Her reasoning for presisting so much? She says it's because of her love for wedding dresses and her obsession with them. Fast forward to yesterday, I came home from work early and I found my fiance at home. He freaked out after seeing me and tried to prevent me from going into my room while trying to text somebody on his phone. I opened the door and was shocked to see his mom standing there wearing my dress. I instantly pulled out my phone and took a photo of her in it. Sheand my fiance freaked out after I told her that she needed to pay me for a new dress in 3 days or else I'll show the whole family the photo. She started crying and then left and my fiance blew up at me saying I can't be serious and that I overreacted because his mom just wanted to try the dress on, no harm done. But I refused to listen to him because in my opinion, the dress should only be worn by the bride and the bride only. quite frankly, I felt disgusted looking at the dress again, I don't want it anymore. And so I think it's fair that she pays me after she ruined it for me. He yelled at me. and told me to wake up and stop treating his mom like that as if she was an enemy. We had a fight after he failed to get me to back down and he's been staying with his mom since then. I felt awful, but I spent 3k on this dress and worked hard .to get it, I can't stand looking at it but people in my family think I'm escalating things and risking my relationship with not only FMIL but my fiance as well. AITA? Update: Oh My God! This blew up, and so I thought I'd add some updates. My fiance called and offered to pay for the dress himself so we can end the conflict but he wants me to : * hand him my phone so he can delete the photo himself.* Swear that I don't have any copies to use against his mom later.* Apologize to his mom.* And lastly, He asked that I quit his family group chat and log out of facebook for at least a month. I haven't responded yet. P.s He called with this offer/conditions hours ago but I didn't want to include this in the post but now I did. Also, I'm not sure if I'll agree because I don't want him to pay for it, I want his mom, the one who wore it to pay for it. Not being vicious but trying to hold her accountable.",

        "selftext": "My husband and I live in the US northeast, where I am from. \u201cJohn\u201d moved here for work several years ago, from the deep south of the US where he grew up, raised with Christian holidays but never attending church. Coincidentally, shortly before everything hit, John\u2019s parents AND his childhood best friend \u201cDan\u201d and his wife decided to move here as well. This past weekend was the first that us three couples have gathered together since any of us moved here; we had a \u201cdistanced picnic\u201d at our house. John sat down 2-3 minutes after I did, as he was settling our kid into his pen in the yard with us. Dan and my FIL immediately started to \u201cjokingly\u201d rip on him for being \u201cwhipped\u201d and doing \u201cmy\u201d job of parenting our child while he was supposed to be \u201callowed\u201d to just catch up with the two other men. I was trying to politely deflect when it turned to how \u201cmean\u201d I was for not \u201cfixing him a plate\u201d and serving him  before serving myself. (If I thought a certain dish would run out before he got to it, or if he had asked me to, I of course would have!) Dan and FIL continued to brag about how their families do it right, where they handle the \u201coutside chores\u201d while their wives handle the \u201cinside chores\u201d (including the care of Dan and his wife\u2019s two children). I think it\u2019s important to note here that both currently live in rented condos that by their nature do not have \u201coutdoor chores\u201d, and **both their wives have always worked full time, as I do**. The whole day was kind of wrecked by that start, and I was frustrated when John left with Dan and FIL to \u201cgo for a walk\u201d and left me to do all the clean up alone while also looking after our kid. I expected John to apologize when he returned hours later, but instead HE got at ME for \u201cmaking [him] look bad\u201d in front of his friend and dad. He brought up how \u201ca traditional division of labor\u201d is \u201ca huge part of southern culture\u201d, and how I was being \u201cdisrespectful\u201d to his background by \u201cforcing northern culture\u201d onto him and his family. He said he\u2019s been building up a lot of \u201cresentment\u201d the past few months that I \u201cmake\u201d him do half the chores and childcare, since in his \u201cculture\u201d, women do the chores and hands-on childcare, and men do the fun parenting, the discipline, mow the grass, and bring in the cars for oil changes when needed. I was stunned but honest and told him southern culture is garbage. It's bigotry. I lived in John's home state for 8 years, and I saw how southern hospitality is reserved only for those in your in-group. Deviate from the norm--be queer, non-Christian, a POC, a liberal, a non-traditional woman--and they turn on you viciously. Does every single person act like that always? No. But it's the culture.  John is livid and says his culture is just as valid as that of other global regions, religions, and ethnic groups, so I am the bigot by not compromising with him here and incorporating aspects of his culture into our family life the way I would if his culture was Islamic or Asian or whatnot.",

It sucks because there's so much our there about us and it's what's gonna come up when I'm looking for a job, when I'm dating, when anyone looks up my name. I found a website that will print custom jackets, print all over the front and back and arms... And I ordered some hoodies that say a bunch of phrases all over them. No photos no videos i do not consent to be photographed no means no respect my privacy no cameras no profiting off my image It sounds silly but it looks pretty sick actually. I got one for me and one for my nine year old sister who's started to not always want photos. And I guess the idea is that my mom can't take good looking pictures, even candid ones, with us in the hoodies without them having a pretty strong message that we don't want to be in pictures. My mom was mad when they showed up, and really mad when I'm wearing mine. Like she says she just wants pictures to remember my young years by, she won't post ones without asking But I know that's a whole mess anyway; she always says that and then negotiates me into letting her post, like either by saying that's how she makes income so if I want money for something, to stop arguing about pictures. Or posting without asking and then saying I thought it would be ok because you're face wasn't visible / you're just in the background, etc. And I'm always like no you didn't THINK. if you thought at all you'd remember what I said I want. No new pictures of me or mentions of me online. Remove all pictures that include me that you've ever posted. and delete any writing that mentions me.  I am just so fed up, and upset that my mom is mad at me for wearing my new hoodie everyday. She's mad I won't take it off for any event and thinks it's inappropriate to wear to certian things. I know it's really weird looking but it feels like my only option. Edit to add a couple more things... She also says all the mentions of consent and no means no and this body is my own (sorry forgot to mention that one earlier) imply something more inappropriate and that it is really inappropriate to wear those words out in public. We've also fought about me wearing it to family events and school events with a generally dressier dress code, because it looks like a gangster hoody. I don't know what to say to that, but I don't agree AITA for always wearing my no photos hoodie?",

But as of now, he hasn't moved much stuff in, right now 95% of the stuff and furniture in the house is mine.  When his mom comes over, she's kind of a snoop. He was used to that, but when she comes to our house, it's so uncomfortable because she's just going through my shit.  When I am bothered, she's like I was just helping with chores etc. He says I should just let her because she has a lot of nervous energy  One thing she snooped on was actually embarrassing. In my home office, I had a little affirmation post it note on my monitor saying I am smart, I am skilled, I am deserving of great things It was a silly thing my therapist recommended to get me in a confident mindset before an interview.  Anyway, she made a comment to about my ego...  But as a joke, I decided to do it again. I had my best friend over and we got wine drunk and wrote a bunch of affirmations to hide. Some were: Medicine cabinet: My teeth will regrow! I am sharklike and powerful! Kitchen drawers: I know when to spoon, but I also know when to fork! I am sexy and self assured! Work desk: I will not just fuck my way to the top of the company, I will fuck my way to the top of the world!  Walk in closet: I am beautiful with clothes and without! Especially without! My boobs are legendary! There were a bunch more, and my friend and I had a hilarious time writing them.  Next time my MIL came over she saw a few. And she didn't acknowledge them to me even though she definitely started acting a little weird about me.  I went to run some errands and when I was out, she confronted Al about the notes and was trying to tell him that I seemed unstable, egotistical, and moving in was a bad idea. She showed him the notes and he didn't really know what to make of it.  He asked me and I said that they were just some silly private notes to boost my self confidence and make myself laugh; how had she gotten them? Had she been going through my things?  He said she was just tidying, and saw them. And they were real weird. I was like 'have you met me? You should know how weird I am. Anyway if you don't want your mom seeing my weird shit you've got to stop letting her go through my shit He asked if I left them on purpose to annoy her, and I admitted that was kinda the joke, but I also have other weird or private shit so what I said about her needing to stop snooping if she didn't want to find weird crap was still for real. He said I was making stuff hard for him, his mom was really protective and adjusting to him moving in with a girlfriend for the first time, and I was agitating her on purpose and making her think I wouldn't be a good partner, when he wanted her to have the opposite impression of me!

        "selftext": "Throwaway account and please don\u2019t repost anywhere else.  I (24f) was with my ex fianc\u00e9 N (27) since I was 13 and he was 15. He was my first love, my first everything. We got engaged when I was 20 and about 6 months after we found out we were expecting. Unfortunately I miscarried a couple days later. That was the worst moment of our lives.  We always dreamed about starting a family early so this was a major blow to us individually and to our relationship. I fell into deep depression and I admit I was wrong for only caring for the lost i felt and not my partner\u2019s. We argued a lot, he partially blamed me and I accused him of not knowing how it felt to lose a life you were growing inside you.  We were hurting each other and decided to separate for a while, that while turned into a year. We still kept in contact, I went to therapy and worked on healing myself, he even came to a few sessions with me.  We decided to get back together shortly after my 23rd birthday. However the relationship wasn\u2019t the same. He was somewhat withdrawn from me and I thought it was because he still blamed me. I was sick overthinking and worrying. It got to the point where i was going backwards in my process so i decided to snoop through his phone. I found out during the year we separated he had been confiding in my sister (27) and it turned to something intimate. He cut it off when we got back together but the damage was done. She was pregnant.  Turns out my parents knew about this and some of our friends. I kicked him out and cut off everybody who knew. Well a couple weeks ago I got an invite to the wedding. Something snapped inside of me, I got drunk and I took a cab to my parents house where they were throwing a party for them. Most of my family was there, I basically showed up and gave a whole fuck you speech to everybody. My sister ran upstairs in tears and my parents called me an a hole for ruining the prospect of their wedding. I said good because nobody apologized to me, everybody just kept saying we were separated, things happen people fall in love, i should be happy for them, the heart wants what i wants. The worst part is my sister told me maybe my baby died for a reason so she could get her happy ending.  I\u2019m regretting getting drunk now because i\u2019m not a confrontation person but i was so upset. Aita ? Hi everybody, thanks for all the support and encouraging words so far. I know this update is coming so soon but i\u2019ll like to tell you guys a joke. My sister called from an unknown number a couple minutes after i posted this lol (I\u2019ve blocked everyone). She asked well more demanded that I return the ring fianc\u00e9 bought since it would be disrespectful to keep anything for him knowing they\u2019re starting a family. She said how immature of me for basically not sucking it up and being happy for her. She even intended to make me her MoH. I apologized to her for ruining her party and told her I\u2019d mail the ring but as for me and her, we\u2019re done and to tell my parents the same. I\u2019m here balling my eyes out waiting on my therapist to finish with another patient so i don\u2019t turn to a bottle again and go off again.",

        "selftext": "I\u2019m the dad of a 25 year old young woman who I love very much. I\u2019ve been able to have a good relationship with my daughter and I enjoy my time with her, but there\u2019s one thing about her that would give many people pause - she is a diagnosed sociopath. She exhibited odd, disturbing behavior at a young age, and after a serious incident of abuse towards her younger sister, I realized she needed professional help. Throughout her elementary years she struggled heavily, getting in lots of trouble in school for lying, cruelty and all other types of misbehaviors. With an enormous amount of therapy & support, her bad behavior was minimized as she grew older. She received an ASPD diagnosis at 18, and I had suspected it for long prior. After her aggressive behavior was tamed, her following years were much more fruitful. She\u2019s law-abiding; has a decent job and a good education; and has many good friendships and admirers. Especially male admirers; she is very, very charming and adept at attracting guys and maintaining their interest. She uses that old dating guide \u201cThe Rules\u201d like a Bible. She currently has a boyfriend of about a year and a half who\u2019s crazy about her, and who I have a very strong relationship with (we live in the same area and spend time together regularly). He is a **great** guy, very kind, funny and intelligent. But I doubt she loves him. We\u2019ve had some very honest, in-depth discussions about her mental health since her diagnosis, and she\u2019s been open with me that she doesn\u2019t feel love or empathy towards anyone, even family. When she acted very sad and broken up over the death of one of her closest friends at the funeral, she confessed to me privately that it was all a put-on, and that she felt \u201cpretty neutral\u201d about the whole thing. She has also stated she has never once felt guilty about anything she\u2019s ever done, and doesn\u2019t know what guilt feels like. While she enjoys being around her boyfriend and is sexually attracted to him, I highly doubt she feels much of anything towards him love-wise. Her boyfriend (who might propose soon) **has** **no idea** about her diagnosis, and she\u2019s been very upfront with me that she has no plans to ever tell him, thinking it\u2019ll scare him away. I\u2019ve made it clear to her that she needs to tell him the truth before they marry; that he has the right to know and consider it; **or I will**; to which she always responds, \u201cI know you wouldn\u2019t dare.\u201d I actually would - I really like and respect this young man, and would feel awful keeping this \u201csecret\u201d from him, and letting him walk into a marriage without this piece of knowledge. I\u2019m not trying to sabotage my daughter\u2019s future. **Maybe** her boyfriend\u2019s love of her personality and other aspects is enough that it won\u2019t end the relationship. It\u2019s his decision to make; but he deserves all the facts. Someday he\u2019s bound to find out she\u2019s a bit \u201coff\u201d; it can\u2019t be kept a secret forever. AITA?",

        "selftext": "My (39M) son (17M) Bryce dated our neighbor Lana (17F) for a year, they broke up mid Jan for reasons I don't know. I won't sugarcoat this, I never liked Lana, she always seem a little unhinged, controlling and aggressive, she's always demanding Bryce's attention and there were quite a few times when she showed up on our house our of nowhere (whether it was 7am or 11pm) because Bryce wasn't answering his phone, screaming and calling him a cheater when it wasn't like that. The thought of our son getting abused by his gf made us worried so much. My wife and I tried to talk him out of that relationship, we said how that it wasn't normal nor healthy, we didn't want to force the break up because we feared Lana would lash out to him so we tried to do it in an sneaky way, we don't know if it worked but they ended up breaking up.  He said that after he broke up with her Lana didn't contacted him which was weird because he expected her to go nuts but I told him that if fate didn't gave him shit he better not tease it. Now the problem is that we bought my son a car for Christmas, nothing fancy but enough to get him to school, his job and eventually college, he parks it in our driveway outside our home. Ever since the month began we had been founding scratches all over the car, we know Lana was doing it but since it was minimal my son decided to not do anything even if we could prove that it was her (we've CCTV). Still, something smell bad for me so I decided to switch one of the cameras facing his car directly just in case.  Well, two weeks ago we got up and we found my son's car covered in a lot of shit: paint, glue, feathers, confetti, the door handles were wrecked, flat tires, paint all over the windows, you get the picture, Bryce and my wife were so distraught. We called the police and I handled them the CCTV that showed Lana and her brother (23M) destroying my son's car. We pressed charges and needles to say, Lana's brother went straight to jail, but since she's still a minor her parents want to make a deal but I refused. I don't think she should get a way out, before the police was here she was laughing her ass off and she tried to play it cool, if she thought this was funny then she's old enough to face the consequences. My wife and I want to stand our ground, they said they'll buy my son a better car and put Lana on therapy but is not enough. AITA?",

        "selftext": "I 23 am the oldest of five siblings and I am a full time student. I also have a part time job in my field but when I complete my after degree  my employer will take me on full time.  I make enough from part time to pay for school and put money aside. My siblings range from 20-10.   Both of our parents work full time. I have taken on a lot of the responsibilities for keeping everything running in the house.  I do the grocery shopping, the laundry as well as making suppers and doing meal prep so everyone has lunches ready to take every day. I also get all my siblings to do their part with regards to household chores.  For example my youngest brother is responsible for feeding and walking the dogs.  So I make sure that there is dog food in the storage and poop bags on the leash.   My dad works very long hours and my mom works 9-5 at a hard job.   Over Christmas I had a chance to buy a PS5 for myself so I did.  The rest of my family is still using a shared PS4.  I keep mine in my room and I do not share.   My parents started fielding complaints from my oldest brother about how I made so much money and I don't share the things I buy for myself.  Totally true.  So they had a talk with me where they brought this up.  I pointed out how much of the household work I did and they said it wasn't fair that o was earning so much money without contributing. They told me how much they expected from me.   I went to my room and did the math.  If I gave them what they wanted I would have about $800 a month left over.  If I dropped a couple of classes next semester I could go to almost full time hours with my employer and and it would only be one more year until I graduated with my second degree.  But I could afford my own place and I would have way more free time and disposable income.   I packed up and moved out. Everything I owned fit in my car.  I stayed at an Airbnb for two weeks until I could get everything sorted with an apartment, school, and work.  It was great.   I'm not going to lie I may have gone a little overboard on Tinder.  I couldn't have women over to my parents house.   I just moved into my own apartment.  I'm staying part time until I finish this semester.  I will work full time over the summer and go to a lighter class load/higher work hours in the fall.   My oldest brother has been tasked by my parents to do everything I used to do.  His chores have been split up with the other three.  They are all pissed at me for moving out.   My parents are upset that I left them in the lurch.  My siblings are mad that they all have more chores.  My oldest brother is especially salty because he has no free time to see his girlfriend and she isn't allowed in the house when my parents aren't home.   I'm enjoying my free time.  I bought myself a plant from IKEA.     I feel bad for screwing them all over but it didn't make sense for me to do all that work and pay rent on top. #EDIT All the chores were split fairly.  I wasn't doing any more than anyone else.  I thought it was fair until I was asked to out in money as well.",

        "selftext": "(No names in this story are real.) For some context before the story, I (38f) cook asian foods regularly for dinner and for my daughter, Lily\u2019s (7f) lunches at school. This is because my family enjoys these foods, I like to cook these foods, and my mom cooked a bunch of these foods growing up since she\u2019s half Japanese. Often times I\u2019ll either give my daughter some leftovers from last nights dinner, plus a fruit/veggie and a snack, or I\u2019ll make her a quick little bento box or some other thing really quick. So, after school one day, my daughter wanted to play on the playground for a bit before we went home. I said she could play for a few minutes, and she ran off to play. I was waiting next to this other parent, who we\u2019ll call Debra. While I was waiting, Debra came up to me. Debra: Are you Lily\u2019s mother? Me: Oh, yeah, I am, why? Debra: Well, your daughter\u2019s lunches have been bothering my son, and I would like to ask you to pack something else. Me: What? How are they bothering him? She then proceeded to start talking about how her son was complaining about my daughters lunches smelling terrible, and that he thought it was disgusting. She also said her son didn\u2019t eat most of his lunch because he was so grossed out. Me: Okay\u2026I understand your son doesn\u2019t like the smell, but can\u2019t he just sit somewhere else? Debra: Are you kidding me? My son shouldn\u2019t have to put up with whatever crap you make your daughter bring to this school. It\u2019s disgusting! And she started making more vaguely racist complaints, but I was fed up at this point. Me: Listen, I understand your son might not like my daughters food, but he can very easily just not sit next to her. I\u2019m not changing what\u2019s in my daughters lunches because you and your kid don\u2019t want to exist near Asian food. Fuck off. She angrily stomped off with her kid then, and my daughter finished playing soon after, so we went home. I talked to my husband about it, and he said that maybe I shouldn\u2019t have told her to fuck off, to avoid her bothering us in the future. AITA?",

        "selftext": "It's a complex situation but I'll do my best to explain. I M45 have a bio son 'Leo', 16 from my previous relationship. I married his step mom who is a mother of two boys 'Connor',20 (deceased) and 'Derek',12. I've never had the pleasure to meet Connor who tragically passed away from a motorcycle accident. Derek was so devastated by this loss and although it's been years he's still pretty much grieving.  I've seen tons of pictures and videos of Connor and made efforts to get to know who he was as a way to share Derek's grief and be there for him to lend an ear and a comforting shoulder. It's safe to say that Derek and I grew a strong bond in no time. But my son Leo isn't close to Derek. Understandable because not all siblings and step siblings are the same. Leo and Derek are different in everything which isn't a bad thing but Leo calls himself the brutally honest type and makes insensitive comments about Derek most of the time. they tend to be under the guise of 'Advice'. Derek never complained so I had to step in and tell Leo to stop being insensitive towards his stepbrother especially, with everything regarding Conner and his memory. Leo would say OK I get it and I won't do it again. Days ago, Leo wanted to hang out with friends and asked Derek if he wanted to join. Derek agreed and put on Connor's hoodie before going out. Leo commented on the hoodie and called it ugly and asked him to put on something else but Derek insisted on wearing it or not go. Leo dropped it. Hours later Derek came home crying with his hoodie in hand. He said Leo and friends cut it into pieces while he was in the bathroom after they convinced him to take it off. I was furious I asked Leo and he said it was his friend's idea then said he had to do it since Derek wears it everywhere and it looked old and embarrassing. I reminded him who this hoodie belonged to and he said so what, maybe this will help him move on in life. I told him his birthday was cancelled and his friends aren't welcome anymore.He pitched a fit saying his birthday was a right not a privilege and I can't cancel it. He had my ex criticize my decision and wanted to host his birthday party but I refused because he's grounded so no party anywhere. She and her family called me awful and ridiculous and asked me to think how Leo will hate me for this but I insisted he needed punishment for putting his stepbrother through this. Note: the hoodie belonged to Conner when he was younger and Derek kept it.",

I used and used until I was basically in poverty and my older sister helped bail me out more than once.  She\u2019s my best friend and I know it hurt her a lot to see me like that.  She also met her fianc\u00e9 two years ago and he really only knew me as the junkie brother then. He\u2019s not my biggest fan to say the least considering how much I put my sister through.  Despite this she still invited me to her wedding last week because I am her brother and she wanted me to be there.  When I get to the reception, my brother in law is greeting people as they walk in.  When I walk by he pulls me to the side and in front of everyone starts patting me down and says that he needs to check me to make sure I \u201cdidn\u2019t bring anything in\u201d.  I instinctively pull away, because why wouldn\u2019t I, and I tell him not to touch me.  He tells me to \u201ccalm down\u201d and that if I want to be here then he needs to do this. I tell him he\u2019s being ridiculous and I try to push past him. He stops me and tells me that he doesn\u2019t want to throw me out but he \u201cwill if he has to.\u201d I told him that he\u2019s trying to look tough but it\u2019s just making him look stupid.  At this point I\u2019m getting more and more angry and I\u2019m practically yelling in his face at this point.

        "selftext": "My graduation ceremony is being held next week. My dad had given me some money in advance to pay for the party. I live mostly with my mom but they were supposed to be hosting the event together. Dad and I have a rocky relationship. After my parents divorced when I was 4 they split custody of me and he was able to stay a good dad. When I was 10 he met Jane. Jane had three kids, twins and a single kid. They got married when I was 12 but I would say even before that I felt like he prioritized her kids over me a lot. He would cancel plans with me if they wanted to do something and would either do the thing with them or force me to go and say it was even better than our plans, when for me it wasn't. Think going for a hike with me vs taking them to an indoor play area. Or seeing a movie with me vs the kiddie park. One more example is when I was given a ticket for a concert my dad and I both love. He was supposed to buy a ticket to come with me for some father/son time, but actually spent it on his youngest stepkid who wanted their room painted. He told me at the last minute and it hurt. There are other times stuff like this happened. He didn't show up at the hospital when I broke my arm because one stepkid was getting their tonsils out and wanted both him and his wife there. He told my mom over the phone to tell me he was proud of me for being brave and understanding, even though I never said that shit. When I would bring this stuff up to him he'd tell me it was natural to feel jealous of sharing his attention. That was all he would say. In 2019 he told my mom he would split the cost of a trip I wanted to go on with one of my clubs, because she didn't have the money all by herself. Mom had her half saved. We told my dad he needed to pay. He said bills were tight and it was the twins birthdays and the money needed to go on something for them. He told me we could do something as a family when the trip happened instead. I told him to forget it. That he was making it clear who was more important and I was going to stay with my mom where I actually mattered. Mom borrowed money to cover the other half of the trip. Dad told me he regretted making me feel less important and we were working on things and then the graduation money was given about a month ago. Then a week ago he called and told me how one of the stepkids was being bullied, how bad of a time they're having it, and with that money they could help cheer them up for their birthday. I was pissed. I hung up. Then two days later I showed up at his doorstep, gave him the money and told him I didn't want to see him or his new family at my graduation, and that he had chosen who was more important so he better stay out of my life. His stepkids and two younger bio kids were there.  I didn't stick around. He called and told me we needed to talk it out like adults, and that I had hurt the kids feelings. His wife freaked out on me so I blocked her. AITA?",

I got a lot of nice replies and awards and i am very thankful for all of the support i have been getting. I'm having my daughter come home from school with her grandma instead of the daycare. I emailed the owner of the daycare franchise (not the manager) and they are very furious and have decided to let go the people who were participating in this. I am not going to report them yet unless they do this again and i am in a group chat with the parents and i told them to all tell me if they do this to their kids again and i am afraid that reporting the place could make a lot of the people who didn't know about this lose their jobs. Turns out the manager and her friends were just power tripping. I am not very confrontational and my husband also said reporting would not be a good idea since if they close down other parents would lose childcare.** A while ago my daughter[8f] was complaining about her daycare because they were not giving her sunscreen. she asked for sunscreen but they said that black people do not need sunscreen but they actually do. before covid they went on a field trip and they made all the black kids sit in the sun and made the white kids sit in the shade because it would damage their skin or some bs. i talked to the ladies at the daycare and they said that it was justified but said if we brought in a doctors note they would give her sunscreen. i made my daughter take it to school and let her share it with other kids but then the teacher took it saying she was not allowed to do that without permission. The other day she came home with a bad sunburn and her skin was peeling and i had enough and wrote that they were racist and segregating kids and that she could get skin cancer because they are forcing her in the sun without sunscreen. i sent the lady in charge articles about cancer and that black people can get sunburned and sent her names of the workers who enforced this. she said that they were under her orders and that she was right because we have more protection against this and said that i was blowing this out of proportion and asked me to take my review down. I am seriously thinking of contacting a news channel about this. my friend said i am being a karen for complaining publicly and that black people have melanin so that gives them lots of protection that other kids dont have EDIT: we live in the deep south",

She no longer meets friends nor welcomes them at our home nor even meet family on person. It's been bad to say the least but her stepbrother (18) Ben has been making it worse with his nagging comments and jokes about her looks. He tried taking and posting pics of her secretly to share but I shut that down even though my husband thought it was just harmless teasing. My husband's sister's wedding was last week. The family wanted Megan yo go but she didn't want to. I spent so much time trying to help her and convince her to start socializing again and see family. She agreed under the condition that I let her wear a wig which I agreed, not only that but I took her shopping to pick her own wig and she looked beautifully stunning in her pixie hairstyle wig. My husband and Ben laughed when they saw it. I don't know why.  We went to the wedding and everything was going well til this happened. We were all sitting and we started talking about Meghan look, suddenly Ben reached out and pulled her wig and exposed her head. I was shocked I froze but Megan yelled then took her wig and ran. Ben, his cousins and some guests started laughing. I was upset especially when looked over my shoulder and saw my husband sitting next to his mom and laughing. I lost it on Ben and berated him infront of everyone then took my stuff, got Megan and got into the car and went home. Ben and my husband didn't have a ride home and my husband kept calling me but I didn't respond. He came home asking about me leaving mid wedding and upsetting his sister and then leaving him and Ben with no rude home. I argued with him about how Ben embarrassed Megan and humiliated her publicly which must've ruined what's left of her self esteem. He said that it was just kids teasing each other and that I overreacted and Ben had no malicious intent he was just messing with her. I said I was sick of it but he said that this is their way of bonding as stepsiblings and I was getting inthe way of it and being overprotective and unreasonable. We didn't talk after that and Ben is refusing to apologize and his dad is backing him up.",

I got a (rather pricey) gift for my fianc\u00e9 \u201cDan\u201d related to his hobbies, I got nice gifts for \u201cDan\u2019s\u201d parents based off of things I\u2019d talked about with them before, and I got a small pack of chocolates for each of Dan\u2019s other relatives (I didn\u2019t know them that well).

Everyone laughed, and I just kind of laughed along thinking it was a gag gift and that the other gifts would be different. But every single one turned out to be coal. All 18 of them.  I started to get upset, so I cried and lashed out at Dan. But he calmly explained apparently this is a longstanding tradition in his family where they gift coal to newcomers who are celebrating Christmas with them for the first time. He explained that it\u2019s just easier that way since all the relatives who might not know the newcomer well don\u2019t have to stress over finding a gift, and it\u2019s a fun experience for the newcomer as well.  I told Dan I couldn\u2019t believe I skipped my own family\u2019s celebration for this and left.

My daughter and son-in-law (my 4yo granddaughters parents) felt very bad for what had happened and paid the cost of the TV that day. My husband was watching our security cameras and our son's story doesn't hold up. We never see our granddaughter breaking the TV. All that we see is our son taking away the TV that is not shattered. We asked our son about this and he said that the security camera must have cut out the part that shows our granddaughter breaking the TV. Eventually I got a call from my son's girlfriend that lives with him. She said that she knew what was going on and felt guilty. She basically told us that our son had made up the story about the TV breaking and stole it and took it to their house to watch.  I filed a police report and his girlfriend let the police into their house to get us our TV back. We do plan on pressing charges against him. He stole our TV and made my daughter pay for it.

        "selftext": "My dad practically gave me up to his sister from the moment I (27M) was born. My mom died when she was giving birth to me. And my aunt told me he never recovered from that because he blamed me for her dying.  It hurt a lot as a kid that at family events he would ignore my existence. When I was a little older he got more vocal about me \u201ckilling\u201d her and he can\u2019t stand to look at my face.  You can imagine the amount of therapy that put me in. I used to go to church crying because I was scared about going to hell for doing that to my mom. That\u2019s how much his words fucked me up. But the shitty part was that I never stopped trying to be accepted by him. After my highschool graduation he told me to never bother him again since he legally has no obligation to me anymore (since he was sending my aunt money to take care of me). Around that time is when I finally started accepting that reality so from there we moved on with our lives.  My aunt doesn\u2019t talk to me about him. Sometimes my grandparents do and that\u2019s how I found out he got married. They were mad he didn\u2019t invite me to their wedding but to me it didn\u2019t matter because we\u2019re not close. But it was his wife who wanted to meet me. It\u2019s the first time ever that he wants to make contact and it was to pretty much say she wants me on their life. She doesn\u2019t know the real reason about why we\u2019re estranged, he asked me to please not say anything and maybe this could be a way to reconcile after all.  But he was only doing it for her. That much was clear when we talked. I never said I would be he still insisted on us meeting at their place because she really wanted to meet me. All she thinks is we were estranged for not getting along in my teenager years, going to college and losing touch because of \u201clife stuff.\u201d It pissed me off that he played it off as us just not talking for petty reasons meanwhile the actually reason damaged me for years.  I told her the truth. Everything he said to me. That he was never a parent to me, that was all my aunt. It was definitely a shock for her. The outcome was a disaster. Everyone has heard about this now. My grandma\u2019s in particular told me she understands my anger. But this was his chance finding someone since losing my mom and now it\u2019s been put in jeopardy.  My dad is devastated. They think it was going too far to ruin his marriage that way when he was willing to include me in their lives which could have been the start of our relationship. And they say not only did I ruin that but also possibly wrecked his marriage. She just doesn\u2019t agree at all with what he did and it could\u2019ve been avoided if I didn\u2019t say anything.  For me it was hard not to tell the truth after the lies made it seem like it was nothing serious. I couldn\u2019t ignore what happened after what it did. Idk if it was the right call since it put their whole marriage at risk after all.",

        "selftext": "Okay this is a doozy, so please strap in and bear with me. For context here, my sister is 30, I am 22.  Ten years ago, my sister had a miscarriage. Obviously, it was devastating for her and the whole family and it took her a couple of years to fully heal from it. We're still not 100% sure why it happened, but it was a one off and she's since had three very healthy, beautiful children, including a set of twins.  So here's the thing. My sister and I don't really get on. She resented me as a kid because she had to share mum's attention and because she thought mum left her dad to be with mine. Never really grew out of that resentment and she was pretty much my biggest bully throughout childhood and my teenage years. One thing she absolutely cannot stand is when  mum and I do things without her, or when mum pays more attention to me than to her. When this happens she calls mum and says she's feeling really upset about the miscarriage and without fail mum goes running. This includes a trip to Paris I took mum on for her birthday earlier this year, which she cut short because sister said she needed her. Also includes when I had a manic episode so bad I was hospitalised and sister managed to need mum every time she was planning to visit me and so she never did. Note, these times when mum is spending more time with me than her are the only times sister brings up what happened and certainly the only times she still gets so upset about it.  So recently I was sick. Like, don't leave the bathroom for days, can only keep water down sick. Didn't manage to get the doctor, but I think it was norovirus. It lasted about a week Mum was popping in daily on her way home from work to check on me and stuff. On the last day of being seriously unwell, when I felt I could eat again, Mum offered to make me some soup while she was there, which I accepted. She was halfway through making it when sister called her saying she was upset about the miscarriage and she told me I'd have to finish it myself because she had to go. I didn't say anything to Mum and I finished making the soup, but I sent my sister a text saying she really needs to stop bringing it up for attention because she can't bear me getting some instead. I guess she told mum and her dad because I'm hearing from all sides what a horrible, insensitive, selfish bastard I am and how dare I say that to her. I understand she may still be traumatised, I just think it's really weird how that trauma solely manifests whenever I'm getting attention and she isn't. AITA?",

        "selftext": "UPDATED!  Throwaway account because she uses reddit. My (M25) girlfriend (F30) Nat has a very particular sense of style. Picture Harley Finkle from wizards of waverly place, you will get the idea. Don\u2019t get me wrong, i never had a problem with that! In fact, i love the way she dresses because she loves to do so, and i am happy if she is happy. The thing is, sometimes she likes to incorporate memes into her clothes. No problem. It\u2019s cute. But now she wants to wear a dress inspired on the meme \u201cgay rat wedding\u201d. To my friend\u2019s wedding. He and his fianc\u00e9 are gay. I told her, maybe that is not really appropriated? The dress in question would be full of little stuffed rats, pride flags and a big \u201cI SUPPORT GAY RATS\u201d on the front. My friend is not a big fan of the way my GF dresses and i think this dress may cause an certain uproar in the wedding. Now, nat is upset with me and claiming that i am \u201cthrowing water in her flame of creativity\u201d. The wedding is next month, so she has plenty of time to think about another thing to wear. Should i just let her go with the dress? Am i the asshole in this situation?   UPDATE: well guys, as many of you pointed out in the comments, me getting a throwaway account didn\u2019t help. She found the post. Guess i was too specific after all. I will update soon  FINAL UPDATE: Hello everyone! I would like to thank you all for your judgment, advices and opinions on my post, it was greatly appreciated! So\u2026 the conversation did not go well. She was livid with me for exposing her in this way, and although i showed her the comments (most important, the ones from the LGBTQIA community) she refused to admit that her dress was a poor choice, but in fact, her way to \u201cappreciate the gays\u201d. That did not sit well with me. Love can move mountains, but can NOT maintain a relationship with a homophobic. So, now i am going to the wedding a single, rat-free-dress, man! I did reach out to my friend and send him this post. He thought the situation to be hilarious, but if she did show up in the dress, he would def kick us to the curb. I guess this is all! Ps: i am deeply sorry for misspelling harpey\u2019s name, won\u2019t happen again lol",

        "selftext": "I'm 29F. When I was about 10, my mom married my step father. I have an older brother Luke who was 15. My step father had Amy and Ada who were 12 and 11. We didn't come from a privileged background, my mum was a min wage worker and my dad was absent. Our step father had a very good income. Their deal was that they wouldn't combine finances, and they would each contribute equally to the household, and then each takes care of their children with their spare money. So my mum never had anything for us, and my step father was spending big on his kids. This included holidays which Luke and I were excluded from (step father would pay for mum, but not us). Luke and I also shared a room even though Amy and Ada had their own rooms and we had a guest room, because step father insisted that he was paying more towards the house so my mum's share would only get her one room for the kids. Luke and I were constantly teased for this situation by the three of them as we grew up. My mum always said that we should be thankful because if it wasn't for our step father we would not be living in a nice home in a good neighborhood.  Anyway, Luke and I became determined to be able to take care of ourselves so that we wouldn't need to take nonsense from anyone. We have both done quite well with our careers and finances and we are in a very good place. Since turning 18 and moving out my relationship with the three of them has been very limited. I wouldn't call us friends, but we can exist peacefully if we are in the same place. I visited my mum recently and my step father mentioned that Amy wants to buy a house now that she's pregnant. He asked me if I'm able to help out a little with the deposit. The house is \u00a3500k and she needs a \u00a3150k deposit. She has \u00a3100k so far. \u00a325k on her own, \u00a325k from her mum and \u00a350k from step father. He was asking if Luke and I can help cover the extra \u00a350k and he said he'd pay us back as part of the inheritance eventually. I said no. He insisted that Luke and I both own our houses outright and with our incomes so we should be able to help. I said whether I can or not is irrelevant, my answer is no. He reminded me that Luke and I each gave \u00a310k to our cousin for buying a house as a gift, Amy is my sister and he's offering to pay us back. I said that was our choice then, this is my choice now. He insisted that we should be willing to help out our family if we're able to, I replied back like how you helped me and Luke when we were kids? Everyone just went quiet when I said this. After a while, he said if we went back in time he'd have done things differently, treated all four of us equally. I said that's good of you but doesn't make you entitled to my money now. He said he knows he's not entitled, that's why he's asking and promising to pay it back, I said the answer still is no, not entitled to a loan either. My mum later told me I could have turned him down without being an asshole or bringing up childhood which he already feels guilty about. AITA?",

        "selftext": "I'm a single mom in my 50s with one daughter. I got very lucky in that I bought a home in the Bay Area nearly 30 years ago for around $230K before the tech boom and now the house is worth about $1M.  I have a 23 year old daughter Camila who grew up in that house and she moved out last year to go live with her boyfriend. I've never explicitly told my daughter the house will be yours nor has she asked anything about it, but just sort of common sense - that's my daughter. Who else would I give it to? One important note - There are 2 homes in the neighborhood that are owned by lower middle class people (me and a neighbor who's been here as long as I have). Otherwise, our neighbors are engineers and software developers. The Bay Area is simply un-affordable if you're not in tech. My daughter is a hair stylist. My fiance Steven and I have been together for 2 years. He has 2 young children (elementary school) he has joint custody of who I adore and I'm excited to help raise them. Steven and I don't have a ton in the bank so a pre-nup seemed silly if it weren't for the house. I told him that I'm ready to combine finances and plan long term with him, but I wanted a pre-nup agreement just for the house. It's a non-negotiable for me that my daughter inherits the house. He wasn't happy with this. He said that $1M split 3 ways is enough for all 3 kids to get a headstart in life. I disagree, I paid 80% of the mortgage by myself and Camila is my only child. She can have her dream life (working as a hair stylist, living in the Bay Area) with this house but will be unhappy (have to move out to a less desirable area) if it's split.  I spoke to Camila about this and she agrees that she should get the house and said she always planned on inheriting it, just like I always planned on giving it to her.",

        "selftext": "My sister and I have always had a strained relationship. I usually just let things go and try to keep the piece. We both have sons who are around the same age. My nephew is 13 and my son just turned 11. For my sons birthday I bought him the new gaming system he has been wanting. He was absolutely thrilled and he plays nonstop.  My sister is bad with money. I usually have to lend her money for bills and stuff for my nephew. I know my nephew doesn\u2019t always get the best Christmas gifts so this year I went a little crazy and I purchased the same gaming system for him for Christmas. I already had it ready and wrapped under my tree. Yesterday my sisters family came to visit. My son asked me if they could go play video games. I said yes and reminded them to be careful. About 30 minutes later my son comes running to me crying. I asked him what was wrong and he led me to the front hall. When we get to the stairs I see the new system smashed on the floor. Someone had thrown it from the upstairs and it was now smashed to pieces. I asked my son what happened and he sobbed and pointed at his cousin. I asked my nephew if he did this and he started to laugh. He said that it was a \u201cstupid baby toy\u201d and that he saw people break them online.  My sister came in and I told her what happened. I explained that this was an expensive system and that her son needs to be disaplined for what he did. I told her I wanted her to pay for what her son broke. She laughed and said no. She says I shouldn\u2019t have let them play unsupervised. That it was my fault and that I am a bad parent. She said my son will get over it and that it was not important.  Seeing my son sitting on the ground next to his broken system trying to put the pieces back together tore my heart out. I walked over to the Christmas tree and grabbed the system that was meant for my nephew. I pulled the gift wrap off and it gave it to son and told him to go upstairs and set it up. My sister asked me why I was making such a big deal when I had another one already. I than laughed and told her that was her sons Christmas gift. That since it wasn\u2019t important and it was just a stupid baby toy than they obviously won\u2019t miss it. I than told them to leave. My nephew realized what happened and began to cry that my son had stole his system. I said no his was the one that he smashed. My sister was livid and told me that I will never see them again. I just said okay and slammed the door. Other family members have now been calling me nonstop and saying I am an asshole and that I ruined my nephews Christmas. I don\u2019t think so though. My nephew is 13. He is not a stupid kid and he knew what he was doing. I don\u2019t care that it was over jealousy, he is old enough to know better. My sister was not going to make the situation right so I just did what I had to do. They all think I should buy another new system for him but I don\u2019t have that kind of money. I\u2019m starting to feel bad about this and I am wondering AITA?",

We got married in the fall of 2018, so it\u2019s been almost 4 years. We now live in Vermont. My whole family is from a small town in Texas, a super conservative Catholic area. I was raised there, but dad got a job in NYC when I was 15. The culture shock was difficult. We went from living in rural Texas to living in an apartment in Manhattan. My parents didn\u2019t sell our house in TX, they allowed our aunt & uncle who just had their 3rd child to move in while charging them a small rent. In college when I came out as bi, my brother and dad were very supportive. My mom needed some time to accept. The rest of my family reacted poorly at first but came around.  During visits we stayed with my aunt and uncle at my old house, but because we weren\u2019t married we weren\u2019t allowed to share a bed. We didn\u2019t argue, we both would rather make peace. Visiting since, instead of staying with my aunt & uncle we would rent a motel room. During Covid we did not visit them. But this summer, my parents and bro decided to go visit my hometown again for 2 weeks, & invited my husband and I. I wanted a motel again but my aunt & uncle insisted my brother, husband and I stay with them. The 1st night sleeping situation was being discussed after my cousins went to bed. My aunt & uncle wanted me and bro to take the spare bedroom, husband on couch. All 3 of us took issue with that.  They snapped that we were not really married because we were gay, & that they had children in the house. They said that it would be a bad influence on their kids. This hurt my husband\u2019s feelings and he started crying & ran out of the room. When my husband ran out, my uncle had the audacity to start laughing. That\u2019s when I saw red.  I started cussing them out so loudly that my young cousins came to investigate. I told them that if they didn\u2019t go apologize to my husband immediately then I was going to tell my dad what just happened, and I was going to make sure to have them kicked out of the house \u2014 that was still in my parents\u2019 name. My bro seconded everything that I was saying. They started backtracking and saying that we were still welcome in \u201ctheir\u201d house but that we had to follow their rules, I responded that it wasn\u2019t really THEIR house. I told them they were going to be homeless if I had my way. The kids started crying cause they heard me say they were all going to be homeless, so we left. My husband was on the porch crying, I promised him that I would never subject him to that again. I told dad what happened. To say that my dad was angry would be an understatement. He served them a notice of eviction for 60 days. I have been getting calls and texts and Facebook messages from my family calling me AH. I want to know AITA for allowing my young cousins to end up homeless? Is it fair that they have to pay for what my aunt and uncle said to me and my husband?",

This was an outdoor wedding with unlimited seating and these people don't give a shit about COVID so it wasn't about that.    I was told it was because my relationship wasn't serious enough despite us being together for a year. That only engaged or married couples were invited. And that they didn't want some random guy in their wedding pictures who I might not even be with later in the future. They don't want to have to look at some random guy in their pictures even though he wouldn't have been in any of the posed pictures at all. Maybe just in the background of crowd shots.   There have been NO conflicts between them and my boyfriend and he's a nice and mild-mannered guy who gets along with everyone so I don't think it was about him personally.    I get to the ceremony and find out that literally everyone else has a +1, not just married couples, but there are couples there who have been dating for less time than me.    This is when I started feeling surly. I smiled and played my part during the ceremony but inside I was very surly and angry.    We then got to the reception which had way more people than the ceremony. This is where all the more distant friends were invited. AND EVERYONE THERE had a +1. I was literally placed at a table as the one single person and everyone else at the table was a couple. Some at the table were other members of the wedding party, but others were random distant acquaintances. People started asking me where my boyfriend was and I said I was told he wasn't invited. They asked why and I said I had no idea why. This is when I started letting my surliness show and started acting rude and mean, because I was humiliated.    AND THEN, I was brought into conversation with the couple's male friend, Dean. I was previously told that Dean has a crush on me and I made it clear I wouldn't be interested even if I were single. Even after that he kept trying to message me and I ignored him. But now the people who brought me into conversation with Dean were like standing around staring at us and giggling behind their hands. Like they thought they were Cupid matchmakers. Dean was absolutely a participant in this   I was meaner to Dean than I've ever been to anyone in my entire life. I was as fully rude as I've ever wanted to be when being the target of someone's romantic interest unwantedly. It's true I don't really know if I was being set up but I was already furious before that happened. Everyone was silent and awkward.   I went back and finished my meal, and as soon as I was done, picked up my purse and left and went straight to my boyfriend's house, skipping most of the reception, cake cutting, speeches, and everything.    I'm now being told by the couple that they're hurt and confused why I left so early. I haven't replied.",

After we got engaged, I suggested it might be nice if I asked my fianc\u00e9's niece (who's 15) if she wanted to be a bridesmaid too. I've only met her a couple of times, so we're not close, but she seemed like a cool kid and I thought it might be a nice way for us to bond/ get to know each other/ involve her in the wedding. (Side note - she's the only niece/ nephew on either side of the family). Anyway, cut to a few weeks ago and we're in my fianc\u00e9's hometown to visit his family and discuss wedding-related stuff. His brother, sister-in-law and their daughter came over and I noticed this time that she was dressed a lot more androgynous than I remembered. The topic moved to wedding dresses and bridesmaid's dresses and I could see she was immediately uncomfortable. Her parents (her mum really) and grandma were making comments about how she'd need to be more feminine/ brush her hair etc, and how nice it would be to see her like that. I'll be honest and say this hit a nerve with me, as I was very much a tomboy as a teenager (even though I'm not anymore) and it absolutely broke me whenever my relatives would say things like that. Eventually, her mother made a comment along the lines of, It'll be nice to see you dressed like a girl for once. and she looked really sad/ embarrassed/ upset. In response, because that *really* hit a nerve, I immediately told her that my maid of honour would be wearing a trouser suit for the wedding and not a dress and that I'd given all the bridesmaids the option of wearing anything they want as long as it's in the wedding colour, to make things easier. I pulled out my phone and started showing her photos of the ideas my friend had sent me (a jumpsuit, culottes, a trouser suit, a tailored tux etc) and let her know that she could pick anything at all she wanted - she could even wear jeans and trainers if that made her comfortable \u2013 and that it's a wedding, not a fashion show. My niece perked up a bit when I said that but her mum looked really pissed off. She's since asked my fianc\u00e9 to pressure me into getting all the bridesmaids dresses so their daughter will have to wear one (which, lol, no). My husband doesn't give a shit what she wears, but obviously also doesn't want his family and me to be arguing on the wedding day. I don't want to back down because I know what it feels like to be pressured into wearing something that makes you uncomfortable, but on the other hand, I know it's only for a day and it'd make the family happy.  AITA for trying to overrule her parents?",

        "selftext": "My daughter is 12, I'm trying to teach her ways of creating and respecting her boundaries that are age appropriate. Teaching her that it's ok to say No to things she feels uncomfortable with. There is a boy in her class who keeps bothering her and her female friends at recess. I've encouraged her to go to me or her teacher when this happens. My daughter told me a few days ago that in class, the teacher had asked the kids to form groups of about four or five. She had formed a group of five with some other girls, then the boy who had been giving her trouble at recess came over and said he was joining their group. Another girl said that they already have five, and he should work with a group who only have two or three people.  He said no because the teacher had said about four or five. My daughter then said that they didn't want to work with him, and he should find another group. A few of the other girls agreed with her. He said that you can't exclude me like that, it's against class rules and she said she didn't care.  I heard about this from my daughter first, and the way she talked about it, she had been firm but not unkind. But then I got an email from her teacher saying she wanted to call. She said there had been an incident at school where my daughter had excluded another child, and that wasn't allowed in her class, and she wanted me to have a talk with her about it. Her telling of events was the same as my daughter's. I felt proud of my daughter for her honesty.  I sent her an email saying.. Dear Mrs. (Teacher) I'm sorry, but that is not a lesson I feel comfortable teaching my daughter.  She's at the age where she is already having to deal with unwanted attention, and I'm making a point to teach her that she does not have to be around anyone who makes her uncomfortable. And that a young lady is able to choose to spend time with people who make her feel respected. I understand you already are aware (Boy) has been behaving in ways that she feels uncomfortable with at recess, from our prior conversations. I think it is a very dangerous lesson to teach a girl she has to include and be kind to everyone, instead of teaching her to be aware of when someone is not respecting her No and stepping out of the situation. I hope I don't have to explain in too much detail why I find this important... But to put it briefly, I was brought up with the Include everyone mindset. No exceptions. It taught me to ignore my own comfort level, and as I became a young adult I became the victim of men who used my inability to say No to their advantage. It's a dangerous lesson, and no longer appropriate at that age.  Thank you, OP She emailed me back asking for a meeting in person with the principal. I'm preparing for that but wondering if my email was too harsh AITA for my response to my daughter's teacher? //// Edit to update... I reached out to the parents of the other four girls in the class who were involved, and we all coordinated to go speak to the school administration together. They had similar views, thinking it was inappropriate for the school to expect the girls work with someone who they're not comfortable with, and frustrated the teacher didn't do more to deal with the issues during recess that made the girls uncomfortable to start with.  I ended up asking the school if we could reschedule the meeting to a time all the involved families could make, and we ended up meeting this afternoon along with my husband, another couple, two mothers, and a father. Along with the teacher and principal.  We all presented a united front asking for the following... The school does training for the teachers on trauma-informed teaching methods and the dangers of expecting young women to go against their best judgement of their own boundaries to be nice. Instead of Include everyone the kids should be allowed to respectfully set boundaries and taught to respect each other's boundaries. The school addresses harassment in class or at recess and doesn't enable it to continue.  We went to talk, and I think it went a lot better having all the parents join instead of if I'd gone alone. The teacher and principal apologized and the principal agreed to look for resources on how to better navigate the balance between being inclusive and not forcing kids into including someone who is crossing a line with them. Thanks a lot for all the amazing advice in the comments, I cannot believe how much this blew up and I'm so grateful to everyone who replied with advice and support. And honestly was getting pretty emotional hearing how the lessons I'm trying to teach my little one resonated with other women, whether they're moms too, or have been through some of the same struggles I have.",

It\u2019s just cloth.  Anyway the worst instance possible was with this girl named Megan (also 15f). When we were sitting together at lunch she came up to Aysha and I and told Aysha she dared her to take her hijab off, taunting her saying she would look so pretty without it. (This was with malicious intent because I told her one time thinking she was just clueless and wanted to educate her) Then she forcibly tried to remove her hijab. I moved her hand away and we went to the principal. Instead of getting a punishment, Megan made up a sob story about how it would harm her position on some prestigious soccer club she was in.  Fast forward to a few days ago. She makes a TikTok that said \u201cwhen you get called to the principals office for telling the Muslim girl to take off her durag\u201d.  I was so livid for her. Aysha is very shy and didn\u2019t want to seem like a buzzkill, so she asked me personally to email the soccer organization. Well, I did, and she was immediately kicked off and other organizations in the area were notified of her behavior.  Now, all of her friends are in my dms saying how horrible I am, how I\u2019m a retard, how I need to take a joke, etc. my parents think I should have stayed out of it.

        "selftext": "Last week a new colleague Cathy (33f) started at my (25f) work place. She instantly stood out in the team, because she seems like someone who is very... loud and assertive? Two of my colleagues, me and Cathy were having coffee in the break room (we were the only ones in there and we were sitting far apart), when the subject of travel was brought up. My colleague said she wasn't booking trips anymore because it'll probably get cancelled because of covid anyway. Cathy, immediately cut in about how sad she is because she travels so often and she goes on these far exotic trips to Europe as her hobby. When I think exotic I think the Bahamas or something instead of Europe but. Cool. Cathy then jokes about how all this no travel business is making her fear that she'll lose some of her foreign language skills. I asked what languages she spoke. She claimed to be fluent in 3 European languages, among which were French and Dutch. Cathy said she was at a native speaker level and went on about how people in Europe were always surprised when they found out she wasn't from there. I was excited, because I never get to speak Dutch over here. I was raised in Belgium, which has three national languages: French and Dutch (which are my mother tongues and the most commonly spoken there) and German. It's quite common to be pretty fluent in at least two out of the three languages in Belgium, because you're required to learn them at school (along with English) from a young age. I told Cathy oh leuk, dan hebben we iets gemeenschappelijk! (oh fun, we have something in common then!) She immediately pulled this sour face and asked me if that was supposed to be Dutch. I said yes. She laughed awkwardly and said she couldn't understand because I have a terrible accent and must not be that good at speaking it. Now see, I don't have an accent. I speak Dutch more fluently than I speak English. I told Cathy that I grew up speaking Dutch and speak it to my family all the time. She got miffed and asked what languages I speak and where I'm from. I told her I'm from Belgium, so I also speak French and I added which you just said you speak as well, cool! We can speak French instead! I acknowledge that I was a bit of a dick here, because by that point I knew she probably lied about speaking French as well. She then shoved her chair back and angrily got up, said whatever and stomped off. It was awkward. My other colleagues just kinda shrugged and said she shouldn't have lied. However, she later approached me and told me I embarrassed her by acting superior about my European heritage. I told her there was no way for me to know she'd lied about speaking those languages. She rolled her eyes and told me I was immature. A colleague told me that Cathy had called me a little b-word who enjoys bullying new colleagues behind my back later. I don't think I was a bully at all, but I don't want this to turn into a huge thing. Do I just apologize to keep the peace? AITA? ________________________________________________________________________ Edit1: I'm not sure about escalating this to HR, which a lot of people have told me I have to do. I feel like this might make me look immature to the rest of my colleagues (of which I am the youngest) and it might not need to go that far... It depends on if Cathy is willing to put this behind her and be professional. If all else fails I do have witnesses who would be honest about what happened, so I think I might be in the clear if she tries to twist the story.  Edit2: Some people have taken offense to me giving the Bahamas as an example of an exotic place and are trying to make this into a race issue. I didn't know exotic was an offensive term in the US. Do I think of The Netherlands, Belgium, England, Norway, which were countries she was describing as being faraway exotic destinations, as my idea of an exotic trip? No. Not because there's a lot of white people there, but because when I think of exotic I think of a place with nice sunny weather, white sand beaches and a blue ocean. Maybe it's because I'm from Belgium, but I don't really feel like being in my home country where it's dark and rainy all the time is quite that experience.  Edit3: Some people think she might not have understood me because she is fluent in Dutch, but learned it in the Netherlands, which has different accents. While it is true that The Netherlands and Flandres have different accents, I didn't speak a very specific dialect like West-Flemish or something. I spoke the general Dutch you'd see in the news in Flandres. I didn't speak quickly to try and make it incomprehensible to set her up. I genuinely believed she spoke Dutch because that's what she was saying, so I talked to her in normal, conversational Dutch. The same kind of Dutch I'd use in a work environment back in my home country, the same kind of Dutch I use with friends from The Netherlands. (But with a soft g lol.) ",

        "selftext": "My husband (Asian) and I (american) welcomed our first born 4 weeks ago. The baby is health (Thank God) but I'm exhausted, haven't fixed my hair, barely able to shower and can not sleep. My husband's family had been pressuring us to visit to meet the baby. I tried to hold them off as much as I could but yesterday, I was surprised to find them standing on the porch. turns out hubby invited them for dinner. I was embarrassed and felt like I wasn't ready for visitors (judgemental ones at that \ud83d\ude09) cause the house was a M.E.S.S y'all. Anyways, my husband sat with them while I fed my son then later I asked my husband if we should order take out for dinner. He said NO because his parents would find this rude and unwelcoming. He suggested that I go inside the kitchen and prepare something, anything long as it's homemade. I said fine then went and made some Mac N cheese. The reason I prepared this meal is because of how easy it is. Once I served the family, My husband's mom looked at me and was appalled. I noticed something was wrong. She asked if I really found it appropriate to serve her and the family Mac N cheese. I asked why not and she went on a rant about how disrespectful this was and that I clearly have no experience in what is right and wrong when it comes to hosting. I said excuse me? Who said I signed up to host an expected visit from them and she took it as in I didn't want them there. her husband said they were just there to finally see the baby that I kept them from seeing for an entire month. that's a whole month of his life they missed out on. We had an argument and they decided to go home. My husband said that deciding to serve his family Mac N cheese was more offensive then serving them nothing at all. I told him I was too exhausted to cook their traditional feasts that I was forced to learn from his mom. He took offense and said that I was being mean and disrespectful towards not only his family but his culture. I went inside the bedroom to stay with my son. My husband stayed on the phone with his family for an hour then kept giving me the cold shoulder and refused to eat what I cook in support of his family. I understand how some guests might find it offensive especially his family. but I was just trying to make a quick homemade meal like my husband wanted. What's wrong with Mac N cheese? EDIT* Ok, So I'm seeing commenters here offering to come over for some Mac N cheese. It's amazing to hear that some people here would aporeciate this kind of meal. It kinda makes me feel relieved and reassures me that I didn't mess this up entirely. Come on in Y'all! I'll be more than happy to serve you some mac n cheese, some of y'all even offered to bring mashed potatoes and pizza. LOL would love to have y'all over some time.",

He's a quant PM and makes like 10x what I make (and I make a good salary haha!). As we've grown wealthier, I've learned that people become nosier. Friends, acquaintances, relatives, you name it. In the beginning I would entertain the nosy questions, but since I turned 30, I've adopted a take no shit attitude. When people ask me how much he makes, I no longer say anything. I've learned the hard way that giving an exact number can have bad consequences. My co-worker, 25, is new and she already has quite the reputation. Very chatty, catty, gossipy, you get the gist. You can just tell she craves wealth and status. She wears a bunch of flashy designer items and is always asking the ladies around the office which of the men are single. Last Friday, our office hosted an afternoon happy hour. She approached me and asked how me and my husband's recent vacation to Europe went. I told her it went well and briefly summarized what we did. Then the conversation went something like this: Her: So what does your husband do? Me: He works in finance. Her: Oh wow, he must make a ton then to be taking you on all these lavish vacations! I hope you don't mind me asking, but how much does he make in a year?? Me: Yes, we're very lucky that he makes a good salary. *Polite smile* Her: Oh c'monnn I won't tell anyone. How much does he rake in a year? Millions?? Me: *Awkward chuckle* I'd rather not say, but it's up there! Her: What, he doesn't allow you to give an exact number or something?? Me: *Visibly annoyed* No, I just prefer not to say. Her: *Laughs in my face* You'd think the stuck-up one would be the one with money, not the one without! Me: You should learn how to take 'no' for an answer and when to quit being a nosy bitch. It's a valuable lesson. Then I smiled at her and walked away. Later on, I had a few co-workers reach out to me and say that she was crying and left early and that I should apologize for calling her a rude name. I refused. I told my mom and she said I was too rude to the new girl and that she's young and might not fully understand salary talk. I think she's old enough. Husband is fully on my side but said maybe I should fake apologize for the sake of office politics, which I somewhat agree with. But still, AITA?",

Not like laughing gas that wears off really fast, but actual IV medicine so I was pretty much unconscious during the whole thing. They told me to have a responsible adult drive me to the appointment and back because the meds they gave me would make it dangerous to drive. My mom was on a work trip and couldn\u2019t take me, so I asked my sister in law Bri (24, not her real name) if she could do it as the whole thing would only take an hour or two. I even offered gas money because the dental office is about 45 minutes away. I would have asked my brother but he works during the day while bri is a stay at home mom to their 2yo daughter who I think was at bri's mom's house that day. Bri agreed to take me to my appointment and the surgery went fine, bri waited in the lobby for me to be done. When I came out of anesthesia I was very disoriented and nauseous, which I guess is normal. I had gauze shoved in my mouth to stop any bleeding and bri took me to her car after I was let go. I don\u2019t really remember much of the drive but it felt like not enough time passed before bri got out of the car and told me to come with her. I was really out of it and just followed her because the alternative was staying in the hot car. long story short, we were at a pool?? I was really confused but once we were through the gate bri basically parked me at one of those little table-benches said she'd be back in a while. I was still trying not to puke and was really dizzy from the heat (90+ degrees) and the drugs, so I asked her to take me home but she wouldn't. I guess since it was her day off and she didn\u2019t have my niece she was meeting friends at the pool. I was starting to feel really sick and on the verge of passing out or having a panic attack, so I called my brother. I don\u2019t think he could understand me between the meds and the stuff in my mouth because he hung up and I guess called bri because she came stomping back over, cussing and yelling at me, and took me back to the car. I passed out on the drive home, but when we arrived my brother had left work and met us in the driveway. He was screaming at bri and she was crying. I was still pretty disoriented but my brother took me back home and stayed with me until the meds wore off. That's when he told me he's divorcing bri because of what she did plus some other things he didn\u2019t go into detail about. It's been a few days since then and bri has been blowing up my phone telling me what a bitch I am and how me tattling destroyed her family. Part of me feels bad because of my niece and I wonder if I should've jjst dealt with it and waited for her to be done at the pool instead of calling my bro and causing problems. AITA??",

        "selftext": "I'm at a loss here guys. Realistically, I know I'm in the clear. Legally, I'm in the clear. But I'm being vilified by my coworkers, and I'm genuinely considering quitting my job because of this mess. So I work a pretty standard day job, and at night I help my friend at her restaurant, which serves an assortment of Thai cuisine. Tbh I'm insanely picky, but I fell in love with this peanut sauce the main chef makes, and he showed me how to make it, so about once a week I take it on either noodles or stir fry to my day job for lunch. People know this and a handful have tried it. It smells nutty, it tastes nutty. It's white girl pad Thai, basically. Lately my lunches have been disappearing, or I'll open my lunchbox to find half of my food missing. I've tried addressing it, but nothing has been changing, and I was pretty sure it was one of the new hires that was doing it, but had no proof. Until now.  Thursday I took my noodles, and my entire tupperware was missing, which hasn't happened before. I'm pissed, but what can I do? A coworker shared her pizza with me and that was that, until today. My boss confronted me and accused me of poisoning my noodles because his daughter (one of the new girls) borrowed my lunch and had to be hospitalized. Turns out she's severely allergic to nuts, ate some and boom. Anaphylaxis.  She used an epi pen, had to be hospitalized and now her dad is trying to hold me accountable for her bills and condition, but I don't see it. Why should I pay? I don't mark my food as an allergen because I'm not allergic to it, she was just dumb enough to steal from me and eat something she can't have.  But he's being hateful, and some of my older coworkers are icing me out because I warned him I'd report any harassment to HR if he tried anything funny. Brown nosers, I guess. My friend is aware and offered me a full time job, but I just can't help but feel it's unfair. At the same time, I could have killed his daughter tho... So, AITA?  Edit: holy shitballs this blew up!  I *did* email the HR rep and let her know of the situation. She's been on vacation and gets back tomorrow, so I don't know if she's aware of what's been going on since last week. I should note that I work weekends most weeks, not quite a 8-5 M-F job, but yeah.   My coworkers mostly chilled out by the end of my shift, thankfully, after I explained to the (nosiest) friendlier person that I always bring a peanut sauce dish. I guess the general assumption was that I somehow found out who has been stealing lunches and decided to poison them?  To answer a common question: this was the first time my pad thai was stolen, and no I'm not the only victim of the lunch thief. I usually take a late lunch, and I'm not the only one, so I'm guessing the lady who was stealing food decided what was left is a free for all. F her. My boss said it was an HR issue when I'd tried talking to him about lunches disappearing, and HR always said they'd look into it (or further into it) and nothing ever happened. We're 100% not allowed to eat at our desks, unless you have a medical reason for it, so that wasn't an option either.  I'm assuming she's fine, but I don't know the severity of her allergy or how much she ate before she had her reaction. I'm not privy to her medical information, sorry guys.  Suing.... Sounds like a great revenge, but probably not worth the cost of a lawyer. My friend let me take tonight off to just bitch about everything, and I'm probably going to take her job offer. One commenter was right; even if everything settles down, I don't want to deal with a potentially hostile or reactive workplace like this anymore. It's not a  career with much room for upward mobility, and I didn't feel welcome in our group meeting today. And for the people calling this fake, okay? It's not, but even if it were, why are you getting mad about it? Karma doesn't give me anything, monetarily or status. I can't exactly give out a bunch of details unless I want to dox myself, and the post seems rushed because I wrote it out of frustration during my lunch. Short time+word limit= rushed. Sorry it didn't meet your writing standards.  Anyway, I'll keep reading comments and responding occasionally, but this is it for me unless I get something worth updating. Thanks for everyone's opinions! (And the information about Caesar dressing and Worcestershire [thanks Google] having anchovies. That's crazy!)   Edit: the recipe  2 tbsp red curry paste 3/4 cup smooth natural peanut butter1/4 cup sugar2 tsp dark soy sauce2 tbsp cider vinegar3/4 cup of water12 oz of coconut milk I cook it on med-low heat and add more water if it seems too thick. And use regular coconut milk!! The low fat isn't as good imo  I had to find one for home that seemed similar to the restaurant's since I'm not making enough for an army! I like this one, but I'm also lazy and want it done in 15 minutes. I hope everyone likes it! If not... Well, you tried something new And the natural pb is important! Nuttier, stronger and far less sugar",

        "selftext": "I have big boobs. I\u2019m currently at 52kg and there\u2019s nothing I can do to change the size of these things unless I have surgery. I\u2019m also extremely shy and from a very conservative family so my resentment and shame towards my bust is an ongoing issue.  My friend *Sarah is one of those unfiltered free thinkers who says whatever is on her mind. She\u2019s also slim and her chest is very much in proportion to the rest of her body. We work together and I\u2019m always secretly jealous of how great shirts and tops look on her whereas I feel I look very sloppy and unprofessional with oversized, ill fitting clothes.  Sarah has this way of always bringing up my boobs in conversation, starting off complimentary but often ending with an subtle insult. She knows they\u2019re a physical feature I\u2019m uncomfortable with but doesn\u2019t let up. Examples of things she\u2019ll say is how my boobs look good now but give it a few years, and they\u2019ll be down to my knees, hahaha! Or she\u2019ll show me comments on reddit where people are discussing chest size preferences and most are commenting how they much prefer a smaller bust over large. Or just a general reminder of how work or men will never take me seriously because of my \u2018cartoon boobs\u2019. I know she\u2019s trying to have lighthearted fun but it gets to me and I\u2019ve told her a few times to drop it before.  Now we\u2019re working from home, we all have daily video calls and meetings. Uniform is not necessary and can wear what we like. A few days ago, it was extremely hot and I was wearing a lighter, more revealing top than my usual baggy coverups. During this video call, in front of 6 other colleagues, Sarah starts vocalising her thoughts on my appearance: *\u2018Holy shit! Put those away! You look like you\u2019re in a porno. We don\u2019t need to see that first thing in the morning, hahaha.\u2019* I was mortified. One other colleague laughed along but the rest looked uncomfortable. I felt close to tears, made an excuse and left the meeting. Sarah called me up half an hour later asking me what was wrong and I went off on her. Told her to go fuck herself and was sick of her constant jabs about my appearance. I went on a 10 minute tirade and hung up. Sarah has been off sick since that day and we haven\u2019t spoken again. I\u2019m wondering if I was too harsh and maybe should call and apologise for my outburst? Was I TA?  **Edit:** I\u2019m fuming. I just spoke with a colleague, *John, (who was part of the video call that day) and he told me that Sarah\u2019s been telling everyone that it\u2019s ME that\u2019s been bullying her and making her feel insecure about her appearance. When she made those comments during the meeting, it was in retaliation to how I\u2019ve made her feel. Apparently, I said she looks like a boy and called her flat chested and ugly several times in the past. I have NEVER and would never say this! I don\u2019t even understand the stupid \u2018boy body\u2019 insult because a small bust has always looked very beautiful and classy in my eyes. Anyway, John knows she\u2019s full of shit and has suggested we speak with HR. The others will also back me up. I know most people here suggested I do this and I wasn\u2019t sure at first but fuck it, I\u2019m reporting her. I don\u2019t know why I ever considered her a friend, she\u2019s fucking mental and annoying. **Edit 2:** I now feel stupid for even asking the question AITA. I thought I may have been at one point because the video call was amongst mostly work mates rather than clients and I wasn\u2019t sure if my sensitivity towards my body image made me overreact to a joke that could have been innocent (I now realise it wasn\u2019t). I\u2019ve also spoken to another coworker who is closer to Sarah and she thinks Sarah may have  already reported me to HR. She said the phone conversation we had after the meeting was filled with abusive bullying language and physical threats. It wasn\u2019t a pleasant phone call but the worst thing I said was she go fuck herself and that I don\u2019t want to speak to her again. The rest of the conversation was just rehashing all the comments she made about my body and how it made me feel. She also claimed that I have been making inappropriate jokes about her appearance and work ethic(?) through the years and this confrontation was a long time coming. She also suggested that I\u2019ve convinced the guys in the office to take my side by being a flirt and a tease (did I mention that I\u2019m stupidly shy?) My head is swimming and I think I may be dealing with an actual psycho. I don\u2019t know how it\u2019s come to this ridiculous level of craziness. All I wanted to do was get on with my fucking work in peace and get through this crappy time but now I have to deal with this bullshit. **Update:** Just to answer a few questions I\u2019ve seen: - I\u2019ve contacted HR with my complaint. I have a lot of old text messages and emails with comments and memes Sarah has sent making fun of my chest size. John and other colleagues are fully supporting me as well as my manager. It will take a while for them to get back to me but I\u2019m confident that things will be sorted and Sarah will be dealt with. - My breasts alone aren\u2019t 52kg (114lbs). My overall weight is 52kg. I mentioned this because my chest seems much larger on my small frame making clothes that others wear and look nice in, look completely gaudy and cheap on me. I can\u2019t lose anymore weight to make a difference on my bust size. I won\u2019t get surgery but I have been working on my body image issues which my shyness and upbringing did a number on. People\u2019s comments don\u2019t usually devastate me as they once did but Sarah obviously tried her best to break me down. - Thank you to all for clothing suggestions. I will definitely look into tailoring some tops and have spent some time checking out Bravissimo which looks great. - In hindsight, I should have confronted Sarah more sternly in the past but I guess I was trying to avoid conflict. Others have suggested I may have allowed her to gaslight me which may be true. I just want to move on at this point. **Update 2:** The coworker (*Lucy), who keeps in contact with Sarah and told me earlier that Sarah may have reported me to HR, has just phoned to tell me that Sarah has suffered a serious panic attack. Lucy does not want to take sides but has suggested I reconsider taking drastic action. Sarah is too unwell to talk to me herself but has asked I drop my complaint and she will drop hers, citing the whole thing as a misunderstanding and stress-induced disagreement.  I have had panic attacks before in my life and I seriously felt like I was going to die. It\u2019s a horrible feeling and if Sarah has honestly just had one herself, I don\u2019t want to push her too far. I still want to address her comments over the video call but I\u2019m wondering if I should just drop the other complaints. Sarah has asked to move teams so we don\u2019t directly work with one another but it doesn\u2019t seem she wants to apologise yet. And just to clarify to people who assume I was wearing a bikini top or boob tube during the meeting, I wasn\u2019t. It was a short sleeved plain tshirt which hugged my breasts more than my usual baggy tops.  I don\u2019t like to hold grudges and I think getting her fired during a time like this may be a shitty thing to do. I feel she has already punished herself by displaying this fucked up behaviour to others and losing a lot of respect from coworkers. If we don\u2019t ever have to interact with one another, I\u2019m up for that. I have a suspicion that Sarah may have found this post and read it which I thought I would feel bad about but I really don\u2019t care. **Last Update:** I\u2019m not dropping any of the complaints. Sarah (fuck you Michelle) and I have spoken, and although it started off promising, she is mentally unhinged and without a conscience. I did not realise how deep her hatred runs. Not only did she mock all those things I had told her in confidence about the way my family treated me growing up, she accused me of fucking every guy from work to get ahead. Now I know where some of those fake office rumours about me came from. I\u2019ve been such a naive idiot and allowed my shyness and aversion to conflict to stop me from fighting people who manipulate and walk all over me. I don\u2019t need this misery in my life. If she\u2019s reading this, get professional help immediately. I know you desperately fancy John and, as you said, despise the way he looks at me. I know it bothers you that he took my side and has been a great support. Maybe I will go for drinks with him when lockdown ends.  If I don\u2019t make any new updates, just assume that the right person was reprimanded and faced the consequences of their words and actions.",

        "selftext": "My son was born when I was only 15 years old, and I\u2019ve been a single dad since I was 18. It was hard living for a long time money-wise but I always tried to do best by my son. Today I own my own gym and my son is now 22 and going to college and works at my gym full-time. He came out to me when he was 14 years old and I\u2019ve always been supportive of him and his identity.  I\u2019ve been with my fianc\u00e9 now for about 2 years and while she does come from a very deep religious and conservative family, she has never had any issue with my son \u2013 at least nothing she has ever expressed to me. My son has been dating his boyfriend since he was 18 and I\u2019ve gotten to know him really well. However my fianc\u00e9 told me recently that she does not want my son\u2019s boyfriend to come to the wedding nor does she want her parents to even get the inclination that my son is gay. That if they found out, they would have a complete fit. This really bothered me because I refuse to ask my son to go back in the closet. What is going to happen in the future? When my son gets married himself? Will they want him and his husband barred from other family events? He\u2019s my son and will be the best man and it would be unfair to deny him a plus one because her family has an issue with gay people. When I told her this, she got very angry with me and told me that I was being selfish and over-dramatic \u2013 that it would just be for this one day, that she wants the perfect wedding. I told her that this was unacceptable and that I was not going to ask my son not to bring his boyfriend. It\u2019s my wedding too and I was his boyfriend there.  After that I got the silent treatment for a day and since then it hasn\u2019t been discussed again. However, it has left an extremely bad taste in my mouth and has me contemplating calling the wedding off. I do not want to marry into a family that would potentially discriminate against my son. I love my fiance very much but my son will always come first. I told my brother and he said that I was being the asshole here \u2013 that it would just be for one day and that since my son is an adult, it\u2019s unlikely that he would have that much interaction with his \u201cstep grandparents\u201d in the future anyway. I still don\u2019t feel comfortable about the entire situation and am really thinking about calling the wedding off. Would I be the asshole if I did this? Am I being unreasonable here?",

This year, my husband told me I could go with him and his friend since they were visiting a new destination. He paid for my ticket and everything else since I'm a sahm and have no job. the kids were left with my mom. However. When I found out that he had booked 1st class for himself and his friend while I got economy. I just couldn't hold my tongue. I confronted him about it and he at first refused to discuss then when the argument got heated he yelled I PAID FOR YOUR TICKET FFS!!! ISN'T THAT ENOUGH??? then kept on about how I should stop acting like I was royalty and that if I come to think about it, even economy is fine for me since I technically don't work anyway. I cried because of what he said but decided to just not go altogether. He changed his tone and started begging me to just go with what he planned but I declined. I went to pick the kids from my mom's house and he came back 3 hrs later huffing and buffing about what happened. His friend sent me a text calling me entitled, and said this was the reason why he didn't want my husband to take me with them and I just proved his point. I did not respond but I blocked him since he's gotten increasingly rude over the past few months. He (my husband) said I keep crying about being excluded and this is what happens when he finally decides to include me. amitheasshole for not settling for economy? by the way he's perfectly capable of financing the trip.",

        "selftext": "This is a shitty situation but here we go.  Me and my daughter, Anya, are from India. Our native language is Hindi. She 11 years old now. Her father died when she was 5 and I immigrated to states because everyone was trying to get me remarried to a 60 year old sleazebag because oh no. How ever will a woman live or raise a child alone.  I stated dating my now-husband when Anya was 6. He had a 5 year old son, Ben (50% custody). Me, Anya, Ben, Husband and Ben's mum get along really well. The kids were very well adjusted and they were genuinely happy when we got married. Whenever tensions arose, we dealt with them patiently. Let's just say after walking through the minefield of Indian family/drama, diffusing these toy bombs were very easy.  Anya has a habit of talking in Hindi when she gets really excited. Sometimes, while talking to me, she starts talking in Hindi without even realising it. This wasn't a problem. If she does that while others are around, I would remind her and she would revert back to English.  Few months ago, Ben's mum passed away and he came to live with us full time. He has a room already and we put Ben into therapy immediately.  A week ago, Ben walked in when me and Anya were cooking and we were talking in Hindi and he started crying. He told me he is feeling bad that he can't understand what we are saying. I hugged him and consoled him and assured him that we didn't do it to exclude him purposefully. And then Anya started crying and apologised. The whole thing was just heartbreaking.  Since then, Anya has been making concious efforts to talk only in English and I can tell that it puts Ben at ease. Yesterday, however, she was frustrated and started lamenting about school work in Hindi to me. Me and Anya were in the living room and Ben and husband were in the kitchen and they heard it.  Later that night, my husband told me how he thinks we must start thinking about giving punishments whenever she speaks in Hindi unconsciously until Ben starts feeling better.  I was horrified at this suggession. I have never pulled the She is my daughter, not yours card. But this is the hill I am willing to die on and use that card if necessary.  Whether he likes it or not, it's her first language. Expecting her to always converse in her second language, even when she is feeling some extreme emotions is just cruel. Especially after she is genuinely making an effort to make Ben feel more comfortable. It's almost like punishing for her heritage or for her being Indian.  Of course, this is a huge point of conflict between me and my husband. I think it's unfair to do this to Anya, even temporarily. He thinks me and Anya are unnecessarily making feel Ben bad while he is mourning his mother, while we can try and prevent it.  Both of us are conflicted here. Who is the asshole here?",

        "selftext": " Hello!  I f23 have been married to my husband m26 for a year. I'm in my last year of university and been so so busy for the last two weeks, with many projects and finals looming. My husband complains from seeing me studying and not doing activities together or hanging out with friends anymore. I've told him it's not gonna last forever and that I need to focus because this is my last year and it's been the hardest.  The day before the exam he wanted me to go with him to a friend's birthday party. I refused because I was busy preparing for my exam. he pleaded with me saying it's just one hour and talked about how his friends will be upset if I'm not there. I said no and shut down any further discussions. He got upset and called me selfish and inconsiderate but then dropped it. Before I went to bed, I set my alarm clock like I always do since I'm a heavy sleeper+I stayed up late studying. The next morning I woke up at 9am. I literally freaked out and checked my alarm and found that it was set to go off at 9:30 am. I had no idea how this happened til my husband told me he did this to repay me for refusing to take one, one hour to attend the party so he took this hour from my time. I couldn't believe it I absolutely blew up at him just yelling and screaming at him left and right. He just stood there shocked from my reaction and my rage. I got dressed quickly and rushed to the university.  They didn't let me into the exam hall. I got into a lot of hassle to get them to re-schedule the exam especially since I had no legit reason as to why I was late. It was awful is all I can say. I went home and my husband and I stopped speaking to each other. He kept acting as if I hurt his feelings and traumatized him by yelling. And that I deserve what he did since he was frustrated with my continual refusal to attend all events for the past 2 weeks. I might be wrong for not considering it but I think that my exams should be a priority and his way of teaching me a lesson was not right.",

        "selftext": "Yeah I know this sounds insane but I\u2019m living in it.  So my sister is getting married next February, destination wedding no less. I have doubts whether this wedding is actually going to happen with the pandemic and everything but she is totally set on moving forward. Anyways because of the pandemic, her original venue has made her cut down on guests because they\u2019re cutting capacity by half. As a result she\u2019s sending out \u201cre-invites\u201d that asks everyone to RSVP again. But in order to figure out who to invite and who to cut, she\u2019s asking all confirmed guests to submit two 250-word \u201cessays\u201d to two questions. The gist is that they\u2019ll use these essays to choose who can come or not, based on people\u2019s enthusiasm. People who don\u2019t write the essays at all will be automatically disqualified. I just feel really insulted by all of this. The questions aren\u2019t even pandemic-related, its broad topics like \u201dwhy do you still want to celebrate this day with us?\u201d And \u201cwhat will attending our wedding mean to you specifically?\u201d So she\u2019s blatantly looking for people to kiss ass and tell her why they REALLY want to go.  Anyways I told her in advance I\u2019m not writing 500 words on why I NEED to attend her wedding, spend my own money on plane tickets/hotels, and buy her a present. This has really rubbed her and my parents the wrong way. She\u2019s said that to keep things fair if I don\u2019t fill out the RSVP correctly I won\u2019t be saved a spot. I said fine with me. Then my parents said if I don\u2019t show up I\u2019m going to be in big fucking trouble with all our relatives so just write the essays.  AITA if I stay stubborn on this? I\u2019m already annoyed at the thought of spending thousands and coming home to quarantine. But I will not belt out 500 words on how this is totally my choice. AITA? Edit: I\u2019m 27F. I don\u2019t live with family but she is my only sister. Edit2: Sister has framed these essays as \u201csurveys\u201d but there\u2019s a word limit requirement so if you don\u2019t reach it on the google forms you can\u2019t even submit. Parents think this is perfectly reasonable, nice even, because sister is letting everyone have the chance to attend.",

        "selftext": "My husbands girl best friend (we'll call her Madison) has never liked me, for reasons I guess I will never know. Anyways my fiance (we'll call him Michael) and I were having a hangout with a little bit of the friends that we shared. It was nearing the end of the night and Madison was the only friend left when Madison came out crying with Michael looking angry, (I was around nine months pregnant at the time). The thing that really caught my attention is when Michael called me a raging b**** and a c**t. Myself being a hormonal pregnant women started crying at the name calling. I asked through my tears what was going on and he then proceeds to tell me about a text message I sent to Madison. In the message I told her to f*** off and about how Michael and I would not allow her near our child. I will admit that I did send this, but it was taken completely out of context, I only sent this text after the many racist text messages that she sent me talking about my child and I. I am biracial. Instead of hearing me out Michael kicked me out of the house that we shared (his name was on the lease). Without arguing I decided to leave not wanting to start anything else, as I was walking out the door I felt a cramp in my lower abdomen. I thought nothing of this because I was not due for another three weeks, when I flinched from the pain Michael told me to stop faking. On the way to my moms house I felt a gush of water and immediately turned the car around so that I would make it to the hospital. While driving I took out my phone to call Michael but my call was quickly declined. At this point I was in to much pain to call anyone else and arrived at the hospital. I pushed for two hours without an epidural and gave birth to a beautiful baby girl named Grace Noel. Giving birth without my fiance by my side was the final straw for me, I decided to do something and post all the hurtful messages Madison sent me on facebook. Maybe 45 min-1 hour later Michael calls me asking me if we could talk, I inform him about my whereabouts and he shows up about  42 minutes later. He has tried to apologize multiple times, But I dont think I can forgive him. I went through the pain of pushing out an 8 pound baby by myself all because he chose to believe his best friend without listening to his fiance. AITA for not wanting to forgive him??",

There is one family I definitely should've fazed out by now but the kids are cute and if I don't have another job, it's easy money. My issue is, the mom is never home on time. She used to not give me return times but finally I started asking as it made it impossible to get anything done on the weekends. I'd go babysit so she could go to brunch but she'd be gone from 11 AM to 7 PM. My whole day was gone. After that, she'd start giving me times but never stick to them. She wouldn't even call to tell me, she'd just stay out. On Saturday, I got to her house at 6 and she was supposed to be home by 9. I told her she needed to be on time because I had plans to go out with friends. I was even getting ready at their house after I put the kids to be. She promised. Of course, 9:00 rolls around and she's not home. I call her, no response. Text, no response. Another hour. Nothing. Still calling and texting. Finally, it is midnight. By this point, my plans are long ruined but I'm pissed and exhausted. I call her and leave a voicemail saying if she's not home in the next hour, I'm considering the kids abandoned and calling the cops. I also text her this. I try calling her 30 minutes later and it goes to voicemail on the second ring, I text her again and she leaves me on read. If she had reached out saying Hey, I'm staying out until x time, I would've stayed. I don't know any of her family nor the father of the kids so I can't call them. I gave her a grace period of 15 minutes and tried calling again, finally called the cops (non-emergency line). They showed up and I showed our agreement in text from earlier in the week confirming that she'd be home by 9. They try contacting her, didn't answer. I was dismissed and they took the children to the police station. I go home and go to bed. I am awoken at 3 AM by a frantic call. It's her. Where are the kids? Why am I not here? I tell her I followed through on my threat, check the police station. She cursed me out, I hung up and went to bed. The next day, she sends me an essay saying the kids' father was called and there's a DCF investigation launched against her. She called me every name under the sun but I didn't think I was wrong until I spoke to a friend with kids. She said I should've just waited it out and refuse to ever sit for her again. She asked if her potentially losing her kids was worth me being petty.",

She was a single mom of three kids when we started dating, she had two daughters (now 10 & 12) and a son (now 16). I\u2019ve watched these kids grow up, I\u2019ve read the bedtime stories, done bath time, the first days of school, pta meetings, all of it. I very much consider them to be my kids, and they\u2019ve been calling me mom for almost 6 years now. My brother Ivan (28m) just had a baby girl with his fianc\u00e9 Sara (27f). I love my niece, and my kids adore their cousin. My kids have been the only grandchildren on my side of the family since Ava and I got together, and there\u2019s never been a moment where the kids and my wife were treated like they didn\u2019t belong.My brother is their uncle, my mom and dad are their nana and pop\u2014 the kids see my family as their family and I always thought that my family felt the same way about them. The kids and I were over at my brother's house just hanging out, and my parents ended up dropping by with gifts for my niece.Ivan laughed when he saw the toys and told our mom and dad that they were going to end up spoiling her rotten. My mom said since my niece is their first grandchild of course they have to spoil her. My kids were sitting in the living room with all of us and my youngest daughter looked hurt when she realized what my mother said. My son and my 12yo didn\u2019t fully react to it, but I could tell it bothered the both of them too. Sara spoke up and said \u201coh you mean first grandbaby, not first grandchild.\u201d My dad shook his head and replied that my niece was their first grandchild. I didn\u2019t want my kids to keep sitting there and listening to that so I handed my son my keys and told him to wait in the car with his sisters. When they were gone, I asked my parents why the hell they\u2019d say that my kids weren\u2019t their grandchildren, and my mom said they couldn\u2019t be their grandchildren because they weren\u2019t really my children. My wife and I were going to be hosting thanksgiving at our house this year, but I told my parents that if they didn\u2019t view my kids as their family, then they could just host a meal at their own house with their \u201creal\u201d family while I spent the holiday with mine. I left before they could say anything else to me, and my wife and I have reiterated to the children that they will always be my kids and I will always be their other mom, regardless of our DNA. My brother is pissed at me now because he thinks I reacted too harshly, and that I should try to see where my parents are coming from. My mom texted saying that she and my dad love the kids, but they still aren\u2019t their grandchildren, and she hopes that we can come to understand that because she doesn\u2019t want this to ruin my niece\u2019s first thanksgiving. I haven\u2019t replied back. I meant what I said, but I\u2019m worried that maybe I\u2019m reacting too harshly. ETA INFO: I adopted all three of the kids about 4 years ago, so they aren't just my parents step grandchildren. Even if I hadn't legally adopted them, they'd still be my kids in my eyes. Edit no.2: - My wife's parents don't have a relationship with the kids. When my wife came out, they pretty much stopped speaking with her entirely.- Their bio dad is not involved and neither is his family. He lost his rights to the children before Ava and I started dating. The 10yo has never met him, the 12yo doesn't remember him, and the 16yo wants nothing to do with him.- My parents wanted the kids to call them Nana and Pop. I didn't make the kids start calling them that.",

        "selftext": "I work at a petting zoo here, and this weekend we had two teenager (around 16, boyfriend and girlfriend) who were antagonizing a llama. I told them you might want to cut that out! Llamas spit in self-defense. But they kind of laughed my warning off. Now, I knew that llama spit was a whole lot worse than they probably thought it was. But I decided not to tell them about that. I figured if they persisted, I'd trust the llama to teach them a lesson. The llama was being patient. At one point it gave them a warning spit (just saliva) and they went eww and laughed about it and brushed it off, and then kept going at it. Finally, the llama had enough...and unleashed its green, defensive spit that llamas are known for. It got the girl square in the face. She dropped to her knees and started retching, and eventually threw up. Her boyfriend was gagging and ran away, towards the building that I was in. To make things worse for them, I didn't even let them come in to wash up in the petting zoo's only bathroom! It was a slow day, so I just locked the doors. I told them I didn't want that smell inside, and made them leave the farm without washing up. AITA? The girl's parents called me the next day and yelled at me saying that was too harsh. Maybe it was...I knew that if you don't wash out llama spit right away the smell sinks into your skin and becomes extremely hard to remove, but I wanted the lesson to sink in as well.",

So today I was at my parent's house to celebrate Christmas Eve with my side of the family (as this year I will be spending Christmas with my girlfriend's this year). Anyways, we opened presents up early this morning. Something I should note about my sister is that she LOVES her children. Which is great and I do love my nephews, but every year she gets me magnets, pictures, blankets and pretty much anything she can plaster her kids on.  While it's nice, I don't have a shrine at my house dedicated to them and I know this might sound selfish, but I don't really want them as I don't know what to do with them. They end up in a drawer or something, cause one year she got me a large tapestry thing with her kids on it, and it was HUGE. Obviously I didn't want to hang it up as it quite literally covered the entire wall. I never say anything to her as I don't want to offend her and ruin Christmas. So that's when I had the genius idea of doing the same thing but with my dog. I put him in a little tie, took his picture and put it in a frame. I love my dog as my child, so I figured I'd gift it to my sister. (I also got her a $25 Starbucks card as she's obsessed with them and I wasn't trying to be petty). Anyways, she opens it up and her face drops. Then she goes to me and says, what the fuck am I supposed to do with this? Without a thought I said, same thing I do with yours, it'll look good on your coffee table.  Long story short, she got mad, my family is pretty much on my side expect for a couple of people who thought it was funny but in the end dogs aren't comparable to humans. Which I don't necessarily agree with and wasn't the point of the gift, but whatever, I thought it was funny, but I need unbiased opinons, AITA?",

I have a variety of plants like Lily, aloe vera, also flowers and they all require care and attention. It's a hobby of mine and because I don't own enough space I just stick to indoor planting. I have a 16 year old stepson Sean who loves to pull all kinds of pranks and has been trying some weird-prankes on me lately. I don't mind it as long as he's happy and also because nothing is too serious just hiding my farming tools/replacing them with damaged ones and so on. He just keeps messing around like any other kid. days ago he posted a FB video of him spraying cold water on me when I was sleeping. It was embarrassing since he shared it with family. I got mad at him and had him delete it despite him begging me to let him keep it. He kept sulking afterwards and had his mom try to convince me to let him repost the video but I thought that was crazy request. Sean suddenly became friendly and asked if he could water my plants, I was glad he asked and gave him the watering can and told him to start with the plants in the kitchen. He was gone for few minutes then he got back and started watering all the plants in the house. Later in the evening I was cleaning my tools and there was a weird smell coming from the watering can. It smelled like bleach. I freaked out and checked my plants and the same smell was coming from them . I confronted Sean and asked what he watered the plants with. He acted dumb and said nothing but I found a bottle of bleach in his room which made me lose my temper. He admitted watering my plants with bleach to get back at me for making him remove the video. I was mortified I immediately canceled the weekend trip to the national park that he was looking forward to. he started crying saying it was too much and he made a mistake in moment of clouded judgement. I refused to discuss it, My wife feels bad Sean hasn't been eating well since I canceled the trip but he damaged my plants and caused me hurt and pain. She thinks an apology was enough, he is a kid and made a mistake. She wanted me to let it go but I said canceling the trip is his official punishment, Period I got called unreasonable and stubborn for this and that I don't respect her as a parent too and said taking away the only thing he cares about the most and look forward the most reeks of ab%$&se. Sean has this mentally that if he admits doing something wrong then he'll be forgiven. This isn't how it should be but his mother thinks admitting to it and apologizing should be the end of it.",

She always talks to me about how she loved him, how he always listens to he and he was made for her. I have agreed with her, since I found i=him to be a good natured man, he was kind and humble and was always respectful to our family. We've met his parents for dinner twice or thrice and they hit me as a little sexist, asking questions to my wife like I don't know why you're working, isn't that the husband's job? Its the mothers job to be taking care of the children.   Now that they wanted to make it more serious, they planned a marriage. Anyways we have been planning about the marriage, and one day her boyfriend comes to me and says that his parents want to talk to me. I was going to call my daughter too, but he said that she wasn't allowed. I went with him and his parents started talking with me about DOWRY. I was confused and said that there was no dowry and in 2020 who even gives dowry?? But boyfriend and his parents started lecturing me about how necessary it was and how my daughter would be a stay at home wife(my daughter has told me that she wants to continue her dreams so I don't know what this is). Anyways they told me that I should give it a thought and told me not to tell my daughter for the time being. However I immediately told my daughter about it, and she started crying saying she didn't know that her boyfriend was so sexist. She asked me what she could do now, and I told her that she wasn't being forced and could cancel her marriage if she didn't want it.  Well, that is exactly what happened and now her boyfriend and his parents are calling me saying I took away the love of his life etc... On top of that, some of her friends (some were bridesmaids) said that I was a asshole for breaking up what would've been a healthy marriage. But its my daughter's happiness that matters. AITA?",

Recently I\u2019ve moved back home during the stay at home orders to look after my parents. My brother still lives with them. I find out he\u2019s been trying to date in recent months and confessed it\u2019s been pretty unsuccessful for him. He even got to go on a first date but his date literally got up and left after about a half hour.  I know exactly the reason why and it\u2019s not flattering. For one thing my parents coddled him since he was a kid because he was on the spectrum and was the only boy in our family. My mom in particular always told him he was smarter and more advanced than everyone else who\u2019s neurotypical. This has led to his belief today that he genuinely is smarter than everyone else, especially women who he thinks are inherently irrational, illogical people.  So I know how he interacts with women like me or his other sisters. He tends to say very hurtful things first and when we get upset, he will then say things like \u201cyou are being irrational/hysterical/illogical, I\u2019m just being honest and you can\u2019t accept it.\u201d This is like his catch phrase over the years and drives us absolutely INSANE.  Anyways when he asked me I basically said, \u201clisten the truth is your way of talking to women can come across as extremely demeaning and borderline sexist.\u201d I told him he acts like he can read every woman perfectly when he\u2019s pretty much always wrong. This struck the wrong nerve with him and he later complained to my parents that I attacked him over things he can\u2019t control.  Now I\u2019m in hot water for \u201cruining his confidence\u201d and I feel both bad and kinda relieved at the same time. This was the first time in my life I told him how annoying his behavior is because growing up our mom always blamed us whenever he got upset. But maybe I was too harsh?

Or cut all the roses off her bushes because they were too cheap to buy from the florist I guess. Anyway my dash cam of my car which I park in the driveway near the garden bed caught most all of them close up and as a way to help my mom not have her plants stolen I printed all their pictures out and made a poster that said  Oh Hay there! Don't be a Daffy-dil and steal, or else you might end up doing hard Thyme! We hope Thistle be a lesson to Yew!  And I put the pictures of everyone stealing from the garden around the border. Also gave each person a funny fake name : mr potato head dill-a-tante pothead prick 'Succ-er  i peony in my pants frond-less 'dirt-bag' 'in-fertile and root boy  . I thought it was funny and cutesy, like how can you be offended with dumb plant puns... My mom thought it was hilarious and wanted me to hang it up because she was sick of seeing stuff stolen  But I got a couple complains, one neighbor said I needed to take it down because I had a picture of his son a minor who did something dumb yes but was just trying to bring his sick girlfriend flowers. And that is was disproportionate and rude to publicly shame him. I told him that it wasn't that big of a deal and he told me that I was being petty. I called his kid a little Birch which pissed him off and honestly might of been petty. Another guy came to the house and returned a cutting his wife apparently tookbto propogate thinking it would be no big deal... But yeah it damaged the plant because she cut like a quarter off. And he asked if we'd take down the sign because she was on the board of directors or something from the town and whatever. My mom had answered the door and told him to make like a bee and buzz off.  Anyway I guess they both know each other and now both these familys are annoyed.  AITA for making a petty sign about people stealing from my mom's garden? Hoping to get them to stop?",

I have a16 year old son 'Daniel' and I recently got engaged to my fiancee of 2 years.Her mom and I aren't on good terms because of how she behaves. She's a controlling, self-centered, Dolly parton wanna be. I learn to ignore her crap but she's been annoying Daniel and criticizing his personality regularly (he's a private kid and still hasn't gotten used to the new family dynamic but he's in therapy and is doing fine) she keeps diagnosing him left and right calling him anti-social, autistic and other crap. Fact is, Daniel is a shy, well manared kid but people confuse that with being anti-social.MIL tried several time to force Daniel to open up by embarrassing him with personal questions on family dinners and test his personality type. I've realized the effect her behavior had on Daniel so I gave him the choice to no longer be in the same room/house as MIL and he appreciated this alot. MIL didn't like that Daniel kept his distance and no longer visits and kept bitching about how spoiled he will become for her daughter to deal with. I told her to stop bringing it up but she cried I'm just doing this for Daaannny; Last week she visited unexpectedly wanting to say hi to Daniel. After Daniel greeted her he went into the bathroom and she went into the livingroom with my fiancee.I was in my bedroom when Daniel came and said his journal was gone. We looked for it but didn't find it. I asked my fiancee who was alone in the kitchen but didn't see it. I paused for a second to ask where MIL was, My fiancee said in the living room but I saw her coming down the stairs. I asked where she was, she said the bathroom. I saw her purse in hand so I bluntly asked if she took Daniel's journal. She looked offended and called for my fiancee when I insisted to see inside her purse. She wanted to leave but I didn't let her. Fiancee told me to stop it but I insisted and the journal was there. MIL tried to explain this was her only chance to get to know Daniel better because she cares about him. I blew up at her and berated her for stealing from my son and told her she's banned from my house for the stunt she pulled. she argued with me then left.My fiancee apologized for her but said banning her from the house was over the top.It backlashed and and FIL argued and hoped his daughter realizes how f///ing ab///ve I am and call off the wedding for refusing to apologize to MIL. Fiancee said her family won't come to the wedding til I reconcile with her mom and cancel the ban but I won't let my son be disrespected in his own house and asked my fiancee to understand. I'm refusing to reconcile but am aware this could ruin my relationship with all my inlaws not just MIL and my fiancee thinks I'm selfish to cause drama.",

        "selftext": "I am 100% being petty here but curious if I am actually wrong. Most of my husbands family think I am being childish and need to let the past go, as my SIL can't afford this but her behavior toward us in the past makes me feel this is warranted. 2 years ago my house burnt to the ground after being struck by lightening. Thankfully it was during the day so our 3 kids were at school and my husband and I were at work. We lost everything but we were safe. It took almost 11 months for the insurance to pay out. The insurance covered 1 month worth of hotel stays but after that we were made to fend for ourselves and the only option we had was to move in with my SIL. She tells us we can have her spare room and her office space, since she used neither of the rooms and her stipulations was we needed to purchase all of our own food and pay her $100 a week. By week 3 all of that changed. She then decides we need to pay her $250 a week and we can only use one room. So all 5 of us were crammed in to the smallest room she had, which was the size of a glorified closet space and didn't even fit a twin bed and a small dresser (so we lived out of trash bags and slept on the floor) for close to $1000 a month some months and still had to purchase all of our own food, despite her claiming my children on her foodstamps. She also had no bills outside of her land tax ($450 a year), electric and heating oil (which she hardly ever filled). So we were essentially paying her so she could do leisure activities. It was the worst 8 months of my life.  3 months ago my grandmother decided that she wanted to go to assisted living after a fall and transferred the deed of her house to me and basically said it was mine now. It is a 5 bedroom farmhouse. My boys insist on sharing a room so we have 2 extra bedrooms. Well, my SIL lost her house last month due to not paying her land tax for several years and asked if her and her step daughter could stay with us until they get enough money to move down south. I said sure, 1 bedroom, $800 a month and you have to buy and cook all your food separately because my daughter is vegan. She looked at me like I had 10 heads and said that she and her step daughter should not be made to share a room when there are 2 extra rooms and stated she cannot afford a rent of $800 while purchasing all of her own food on top of it. I said neither could we but we managed to cram 5 people in to a glorified closet space while you were getting $1000 and foodstamps. Take it or leave it. She decided to leave. Again, I am being told I am childish. AITA?",

        "selftext": "This has been causing a conflict with my entire family. And they think that I'm being selfish and unreasonable. Let me explain first. I M39 lost my son in 2019 due to a chronic heart condition. He was 15 years old. It was devastating and I just couldn't take it especially when my family did little to nothing to support me during these difficult times. They didn't bring my son meals when he was at the hospital. They didn't let me go home and rest even for a few hours. They didn't take care of other things while I had a lot to deal with I wasn't offered any help just words. They'd just talk but do nothing. Despite the struggle. I've created an account for my son's college fund and kept putting whatever I could get at the time and me and my son would talk about that a lot. He was depressed but always believed that he was going to get better and continue his education and attend college. I started saving money To keep him motivated and to make him feel like he could be like any other kid with hopes for a good future. He had a very close friend that's about the same age as him. They were friends for 5 years, and I can't express how his presence in my son's life helped him through the worst days, sometimes his friend would spend the night with us and try to get my son to do activities and lighten up his mood all the time. To be frank his friend was closer to him than his own family. He never stopped visiting and asking how I'm doing after my son's death. He'd show me handmade projects he made for my son and as a way to remember him and we'd sometimes just sit and talk together or cry together.  Last week. While I was with my family my sister asked me what I was going to do with my son's college money. I didn't wanna mention this but since she asked I told her that I will be giving the money to my son's friend. She barely even recognized his friend and was confused and said that my nephew deserves this money since he's family. My mom agreed that I wasn't thinking straight and that I should help the people close to me-family and that my nephew has a right to go to college and I was wrong for giving this opportunity away to someone else. I didn't know what to say they kept pointing out that I was making a mistake and how my nephew will resent me if he finds out. Thing is my nephew wasn't close to my son I don't even know why he'd be bothered. My sister went on about not being able to afford my nephew's college I told her this was my decision and I felt more comfortable that way. She started lashing out, constantly texting me constantly wanting to talk to me and ending up arguing. When I snapped she had my mom calling me basically guilttripping me and telling me I'm wrong and that I needed to think about this. It's just too much pressure and I'm feeling lost and unable to figure out how to deal with this.",

        "selftext": "I know I likely am, but the extend of which I'm unsure about.  My son is almost 17. This Christmas we bought him an expensive computer gaming chair, as he plays a lot of online multiplayer shooters. My son has some anger issues, which he's currently in therapy for, and these shooters tend to bring out his temper more than normal. However, for the past few months he's been keeping it together well, so I figured the chair might be a fair present.  I was wrong, because the day after Christmas he was gaming, started to have bad luck and apparently people in-game were fucking with him because he was losing his patience. This culminated in him screaming insults and then picking up his chair and slamming it into the ground, breaking the back of it. After talking him down, we had a very serious conversation about him no longer being allowed to play multiplayer games while under my roof until his therapist feels comfortable with his progress, talked about coping mechanisms, etc. However, I made it very clear this was unacceptable and he would be grounded. We've had these heart-to-hearts many times, so it's not like every time he has an outburst I'm making light of it. It's a serious issue and treated like such. However, when he came to me later that day and told me he'd like me to replace the chair because it was a gift, he really liked it and it would only be fair, the frustration, disbelief and disappointment in his behavior boiled over and I started laughing hysterically. As in a full laughing fit, barely able to breathe or talk. The more he'd plead his case, the harder I'd laugh, repeatedly asking him how it was fair in his mind to have me replace a gift I paid for that he broke in anger. This obviously pissed him off more, which led to him getting emotional, but I just couldn't seem to stop myself. I tried walking out of the room and asking him to drop it but every time he'd say but I need a chair! or What am I supposed to do now I'd laugh again. I tried explaining that I'm not laughing at his feelings, I'm laughing at how absurd it is for him as a teenager to expect me to replace shit he can't be bothered to treat with respect and then whine about it when he broke it. He's still pissed about it, and feels slighted. I feel bad for laughing, and honestly wonder if I had some sort of mini-stress break myself, because it's never happened before and I couldn't seem to stop. But at the same time, I stand by the fact that his request *was* ridiculous enough to make most people *want* to laugh. How badly did I fuck up?",

        "selftext": "I have a small group of close friends (all males around the age of 25) that I hang out with almost every day. We've all known each other almost all our lives and recently (~1.5 years) got a new addition to our group, John.  I never really liked John. He was rude, obnoxious, and would always talk like he knows everything. He was also incredibly pretentious. A friend of mine said Einstein once and John interrupted him to say, I have no idea who you are talking about. Do you mean the reknown scientist Albert EinSHTein?. I once put up a snapchat story saying, I love college football!, and he replied to my story with It's called gridiron you moron.  I don't understand how but my friends readily accepted him into our friends circle.  On one night about 5-6 months ago, we had a little get-together and were just drinking and having fun. John was kind of tipsy. We had some new girls show up so I was kinda working my charm on them. They asked me what I did and I went I'm a Biomed Engineer. I don't know why that triggered John so much, but he went on this hour long tirade about how I'm just a drone in a rat race. He kept telling me about how I'm just like every other person and lacked creativity. He later passed out, but his little tirade became a running joke in our group. Every time I mention work or anything, John would start roasting me. He nicknamed me 'drone' and kept calling me that even though I expressed multiple times that I dont like to be called a drone. He would keep telling me about how easy engineering is (he watched some intro to engineering courses online) and that any monkey with a brain can do what I do. That really pissed me off. Once I told him to shut the fuck up but he was like, What are you going to do, fight me? I dare you to swing. I didn't want to fight him so now I started getting referred to as a 'pussy'.  Over the last few months or so I kinda went frontpage a couple of times on Reddit and everyone was like, damn M0shka you famous now (as a joke). That triggered him even more. He'd say stuff like His posts suck. They're not even funny. Reddit is now just filled with stupid facebookers who upvote stupid clickbait shit and downvote meaningful talent.  At this point it is relevant to bring up what John does. He's a 'photographer' who works as a barista at Starbucks. How good is he? Honestly, he started off as an annoying kid with a DSLR, no talent, and a facebook page where he uploaded 3/10 pictures. Over the years he got slightly better but it's still terrible. I'd say he's more of a 5/10 now. 2 weeks ago, he got rejected from his dream job and made an Instagram post about how National Georgraphy discriminated him because of his skin color (brown).  Last week, we had a surprise birthday party at his place with his family (he lives with his parents) and friends. At the party, I apologized to him (I hadn't met him since the post) and said, I'm sorry you didn't get Nat Geo. To which he got angry again and said, I'd rather eat my own shit than be a drone like you. What I'm doing is making real art and it's something your robot brain won't ever understand now or in the future, so I actually feel sorry for you. He said stuff like this in front of a girl I was with who got so enraged that she left and told me to tell them that shes sick or something.  That's it. I fucking lost it. We were handing out mics to talk about our favorite memory with John and I took that opportunity to say, Well John, your pictures fucking suck, no wonder Nat Geo rejected you. You're a 27 year old barista with no college degree, mooching off your parents, and taking worse pictures than any jackass with an iPhone camera. You're not going to amount to anything in life so just --- *I get cut off here*  His dad grabbed the mic and shoved me. John came charging at me but everyone just held him back. The rest of the guys were like get him out of here, and I got kicked out. No one has talked to me since the incident and John blocked me from all social media. Our group chat has been pretty silent too. John also apparently made a roast post about me. Idk if I should apologize to him or not. Sorry for the long post. I know John is an asshole, but AITA? ",

        "selftext": "So I dated a YouTuber. We went out for about a year and it was alright but they were so emotionally invested in their channel that they constantly neglected me and made me feel like I wasn't a priority. Not really important why we broke up, but we broke up. Then I get a bunch of messages from friends about 3 months later telling me to go to their channel. I'm pretty much done with them but I do and I realise they made a video about me where they claim I was emotionally abusive. I continued to get messages from strangers telling me how awful a person I was and how they hoped I died through various means. So I sued my ex. It ruined them. I knew they were financially in a bad spot and they likely couldn't afford court fees but the case dragged. They made a video about not being able to afford court costs and such and how it was going to ruin them. After which a bunch of friends started telling me to just let it go and move on but I had sunk money into the case as well. It wasn't cheap for me either so I didn't just let it go. Eventually the judge ruled in my favor and I received a total of nothing from my ex...... But it meant I could link to the result in the comments section of every video she tried to frame me as the bad guy because in our state, court proceedings are public record. Suddenly her viewership dropped and she blamed me for ruining her life. A bunch of my friends said I went too far and should've just taken the court win and left her alone. Was I the asshole?",

        "selftext": "I\u2019m an author of mild success. I\u2019m not incredibly popular, but my books sell enough. About 3 months ago, someone from my old high school reached out to see if a student could interview me. I responded that my time at the school wasn\u2019t the happiest, but I would give the student responses relating to my career. We had a great chat. She started asking questions about my time at the school, but I redirected. She caught on to what I was doing and asked \u201cI\u2019m sensing that you\u2019re hesitant to talk about your time at (school). Is that true?\u201d I said let\u2019s focus on the story, and she was like \u201cActually this could be a better story.\u201d So I said y\u2019know what, sure. Whatever. I don\u2019t owe the school anything, I\u2019m not being paid, and even though it\u2019s been a long time and I\u2019ve grown from what happened, it\u2019s still worth talking about. I mentioned a few names in specific, and how I\u2019d tried to ask for help and was blown off by everyone. Teachers at my school very strongly favored the girls in sports teams, and would often be buddy buddy with them and their parents. I mentioned a teacher who openly mocked the way I dressed, my lack of athleticism, etc. I brought up the time that a group of girls followed me around the school mooing at me and when I broke down crying because they wouldn\u2019t stop and tried to tell a teacher, the teacher called me \u201cMoolly\u201d for the rest of the year and when I yelled \u201cMY NAME IS MOLLY. *MOLLY\u201d* she had me suspended for a week. She ended up publishing the whole interview. Nothing exactly went \u201cviral\u201d but there were posts on FB with a ton of comments and it caused some commotion in that community. A few weeks later, I was contacted by a school official who chastised me for bringing up old wounds and trying to paint veteran teachers as bad people when they were going through difficult times already. The teacher responsible for the \u201cMoolly\u201d incident had a local lifetime teaching award taken away from her after it all came out, so was it really worth it, and maybe did I remember things wrong? Finally, a handful of my old classmates (many of them stuck around town) found me and I was barraged with a ton of messages telling me that I\u2019m ruining the reputation of the school and of several prominent community members, it was X years ago so why can\u2019t I just get over it, etc. Some of them obviously haven\u2019t changed. It was a long time ago, yes. I don\u2019t know how I really feel about how this all went down though. I know times are tough for teachers right now. I didn\u2019t set out to hurt anyone, I was just telling my truth. AITA? **Edited:** So... I didn't expect this to be so overwhelmingly in favor of NTA. I wasn't looking for validation, but wow. Some of you are sending me heartbreaking stories of bullying and being ignored or gaslit, and I am so sorry. Thank you all for the responses. If the Mods want to take this down because of validation or whatever, please do. I have my answer. ",

I wanted to give them up but my parents told me not to.  For the first seven years of my boys\u2019 lives, I didn\u2019t act like a father and was more like a big brother (They knew I was their father though, but we never bonded like father-sons)  When I was ready to move out, I wanted to do it without them but my dad let me know it was my responsibility so I had to take them (I didn\u2019t want it at first but I\u2019m glad it happened) We started bonding as father-sons, I started loving them and their love for me increased I remember the three of us would seat on the couch to watch movies, one would sit on my left and one on my right while I wrapped my arms around them, they\u2019d put their heads on my chest and I often kissed their forehead. We\u2019ve been doing this since they were seven. I met my current wife, 5 years ago, (my kids were 15) we married 3 years ago after we welcomed our daughter (4F), she saw me doing this with my kids when we watched movies and she never said anything.  My kids are no longer living with us because they left for college, but they come to see me every now and then. My boys are 20 now but they still like to put their heads on my chest while I wrap my arms around them, they do it every time they visit and I\u2019m watching TV. My son, Liam visited me 2 weeks ago, he came out to me as gay and introduced me to his bf. I don\u2019t care how my kids live their sexuality or who they love, I love them no matter what, I just want them to be happy and I don\u2019t feel any different, and it doesn\u2019t make me feel uncomfortable to hug him or kiss his forehead, but it seems that my wife is a little uncomfortable.  My son visited me again last Wednesday (Since he was here 2 weeks ago, so the first time \u201cofficially out\u201d) I was watching \u201cRed\u201d with my daughter (she was on my left) then my son Liam arrived, he was tired and sat on my right, put his head on my shoulder while I wrap my arm around him, then I kissed his forehead and said, \u201cGood to have you back buddy\u201d.  We went to sleep and the next day my wife told me that It made her feel uncomfortable (me hugging and kissing my son) and asked me not to do it again while she doesn\u2019t mind me doing it with Lucas (my other son, straight) she doesn\u2019t want me to do it with Liam. I told her that she has no business being in my relationship with my sons, I also called her homophobic. She accused me of not treating her like an equal parent, (to my sons) thus I said that's  ok because you are not  My brother says I should understand because this is a big \u201cchange\u201d for her (a son coming out) but seriously think there is nothing to get \u201cused to\u201d this isn\u2019t neither her nor my problem who my son loves.

        "selftext": "Throwaway in case someone I know sees this, don't want them to know my main reddit account. So I am a 30 year old man. I'm single and live alone in a house that I own. A few months ago you know what happened and my mom lost her job. So I decided to let her stay with me. I have a medical marijuana card and smoke every day. I knew my mom disliked weed so I warned her before she moved in that I would be smoking weed daily and would not stop for her. She agreed, and only asked that I smoke outside. Which I thought was a relatively reasonable request; weed has a strong smell and many people don't like it. At first this worked out fine at first. But she started making remarks about how I should quit, ect. I mostly just ignored them/brushed them off. Then it evolved to her demanding that I quit. As if I were still\u00a0 a child she could issue orders to. I refused and told her that she can move out if she doesn't like it. She started crying and saying that I don't love her, I have a problem, ect.\u00a0 The next day, I come home from work to find her waiting for me. She explained that she had flushed my weed (a little less than an ounce) for my own good. And then demanded that I go to treatment.\u00a0 Well, predictably, I was furious. And not even really about not having the weed anymore. It is pretty cheap (I usually buy ounces for $125) and I can easily get more. It was about her total lack of respect for me. I'm an adult, own my own house, have a good job, and have approval from the state to legally purchase and possess marijuana.\u00a0 So someone I'm doing a huge favor for demanding that I stop and throwing out my stuff when I refused is extremely outrageous to me. No matter if she pushed me out of her vagina 30 years ago. Anyway, we argued about this for a while and it became clear to me that she was not sorry at all and that she would probably do it again. So I told her she can't live with me anymore. I gave a month, but she has already packed all her shit and drove to my brothers house a couple hours away.\u00a0 She obviously thinks I'm a huge asshole. So does my brother. But I think that's mostly because she is his problem now.",

        "selftext": "Throwaway account, English is not my first language, I\u2019m on mobile - I apologise.  I (27F) have been married with my husband (M32) for three years and haven been dating for a little over 5. My husband has this friend (F31) \u2018Mary\u2019. They\u2019ve known each other since they were in high school and she\u2019s considered \u2018one of the boys\u2019, if you may. That basically means she\u2019s always invited to all the fishing trips and stuff, which I don\u2019t mind at all, I trust my husband.  Well, my problems with Mary started when she first found out I\u2019m half Romanian. It started kinda innocently, with her asking me to say certain words, teach her some insults etc which didn\u2019t necessarily bother me, but it usually put me on the spot whenever we were out with my husband\u2019s group of friends. It only escalated to her googling stuff about Romania and asking me \u2018are you a vampire? do you bite your husband by the neck?\u2019 to \u2018are you a gypsy? I bet you\u2019ve got some of that gypsy blood in you\u2019 (which is just blatantly racist) Last week, me and my husband organised a mini BBQ with our friends and Mary was invited by my husband despite me telling him she makes me uncomfortable. He said he had talked to her about her remarks and she\u2019s been understanding so it\u2019s unlikely she\u2019ll say something this time. It was midnight and there were about 4 of us left and I accidentally spilled some red wine on Mary\u2019s jeans when I tripped over a carpet. All hell broke loose. Mary started saying that I\u2019m a witch and I\u2019m trying to ruin her life and this whole thing is part of my ritual and I\u2019m just a \u2018immigrant gypsy trying to ruin my husband\u2019s life\u2019 and I\u2019ve poisoned my husband against her. I started crying and profusely apologising. When she wouldn\u2019t drop it, I kicked her out and banned her from ever coming to my house again.  AITA for doing this? My husband insists that Mary was just drunk and talking nonsense and he would talk to her. He also told me I\u2019m way too sensitive about my heritage and I\u2019m an a-hole for banning her. Mary has since given me a half hearted apology but I\u2019m still not ok with her. EDIT: I guess this is the update some of you wanted. Sorry I\u2019m still a mess and idk how coherent I am. We\u2019ve talked. He admitted to being in and out of an affair with Mary in the first 2y of our relationship and she wanted to win him back I guess. I called my mom to come help me pack some stuff and im out. Thats it. Mary can have him I\u2019ve been gaslit for years and it took a reddit post to realise. Oh the irony. thank you reddit. EDIT2 and probably the last one for a period of time:   A lot of people seemed suspicious of Mary and my husband\u2019s friendship/relationship etc and have asked if I ever suspected anything. No, I didn\u2019t. Me and my husband had (or I thought we had) a very strong relationship, based on communication and honesty (guess it only applied to me). Also, Mary is very close with all the boys in the said friendship group. The other wives raised concerns in the past but they\u2019ve all been shut down by the boys in the group or by Mary herself. I guess I always respected their friendship group because they were very close for so long and it felt unfair to change that because of me. As far as I\u2019m aware, the other wives feel the same - plus Mary has been in a LD relationship for about 2 years and always claimed she\u2019s focusing on her career, she\u2019s too busy etc so none of us ever saw her as a potential threat.   But now it just makes me think there could be more to this story. But I\u2019m tired, as of right now, I am just exhausted. My Romanian witch blood won\u2019t let me live until I find out the whole truth but I need time.  Thank you to everyone who took the time to reply to my post, message me (even the ones that insulted me further - it was semi-funny) and thank you for the awards! I\u2019m sending virtual hugs to all of you! Ave\u021bi grij\u0103 de voi!",

        "selftext": "For some reason my 14 year old son cannot wipe properly.  This was never a concern to me as his mom did the laundry.   Unfortunately she is sick right now so I have taken over the household chores that she used to handle.  My son is still responsible for his and I do mine as well as hers.   First day I did laundry I gagged and almost puked from his underwear.  If he were three and not fully potty trained I might understand how they end up like this.  But he is a healthy young man.  He should not be leaving his ass this unwiped.   I talked to him about it and he said he would make an effort to do a better job.  Nope. No change in the situation.  So I went to the hardware store and installed a wand bidet in the bathroom he uses.  We already have one in ours.  I told him that he has a choice of either using the bidet or washing his own underwear.  He doesn't know how to use the washing machine and he refuses to do them by hand.  He started going commando.  Which just meant the problem was his jeans now.   So I said that we might need to take him to the doctor to see what is wrong with him.  If it's physical or psychological.  I also said that the next time his friends were over I was going to ask them is they left their underwear in the same condition.  I WOULD NEVER ACTUALLY EMBARRASS HIM LIKE THAT. He said I was being an asshole and he called his mom to tell her what I was doing.  She said that he was just like that and I could deal with it until she was better.   I don't think that's a great plan.  If this kid never learns to wipe his ass he will be bereft of a sexual partner without a poop fetish.  I'm not kinkshaming him if that's his thing.   He has started using the bidet but he says that it is gross and weird.  I said it was grosser and weirder for a 14 year old to crap his pants every day.  We are both stressed about his mom but this situation isn't because of her. I asked her.",

        "selftext": "I (21f) have a brother (28) who came out as gay last month. He has been married to my best friend's big sister (24) for four years, they have 2yo twin daughters together. I'm really close with her, so I've been trying to stay neutral in what has become a messy separation.  My brother told his wife he's gay by sitting her down, and saying he had been sleeping with two different men for about six months. He said he is now sure that he feels romantic feelings for men, and also told her he has been sleeping with random men from Grindr for over a year behind her back. She obviously freaked out, asked him how he could do this, why didn't he tell her when he started having the feelings, etc. He said that he's always thought he was gay but he didn't want to come out because it might affect his career. She asked him what about the effect on her life? She is now a single mother to two toddlers. He was essentially very angry that she wasn't supportive of this, so he kicked her out of the house, with the kids. After she eventually found a place to stay, my brother moved in one of the men he has been having an affair with.  Since then, he has had very little contact with the kids, as in speaking to them on the phone once a week maybe. He has expressed that he still doesn't want to be public about coming out, so he posted on Facebook that he has separated from his wife because they aren't in love anymore and hinted SHE was the unfaithful one (posting things like 'yeah, seems like someone in this relationship wasn't satisfied with just one man') and is basically being a dick. I told him a couple weeks ago that he's a fucking asshole and I don't want to be involved with him anymore because I think it's disgusting that he's treated his wife like this. I told him I get that you have to come out in your own time, but you don't need to kick her out, ignore your kids and berate her, and you don't need to make comments that people will assume mean she was being unfaithful (he said this was a joke about him having two partners now? still fucked up). He said I'm being a homophobic asshole, and that I don't know how hard it is to come out. He said that if I don't accept him, I'm a bigot. He made mistakes and what not. I said maybe I will forgive him if he improves his behaviour to his wife, and he said he resents her for keeping him from sleeping with men for years. I gave up at this point. My sisters (17&24) both think I'm being homophobic, my mom agrees with me. AITA?",

        "selftext": "Okay, throwaway because my boyfriend knows my other account.  I (23f) moved in with my boyfriend (24m) of two years a couple months ago. We haven\u2019t had any problems before this argument. Things had been going pretty well.  Anyways, a couple days ago, I got my period. It came early and I had ran out of pads. I couldn\u2019t leave to buy some because I bleed pretty heavily and I would\u2019ve bled through my pants. So I asked my boyfriend if he could buy pads for me from the drugstore, because it was late. He immediately said no. I was shocked because I wasn\u2019t really expecting that.  I asked him why. He said that he didn\u2019t want the cashier to see him buying pads. At this point I started laughing because that was hilarious. He wasn\u2019t joking though. He just glared at me. I told him that the cashier would obviously know it wasn\u2019t for him. Plus, the cashier would definitely not care what he was buying. He still refused. I told him that he could go to the self checkout machine if he was so insecure, but he said that he didn\u2019t want anyone to see him with the pads because they\u2019d think he was a \u201ctr***y\u201d. I told him that he was childish, and that his masculinity was really fragile if he couldn\u2019t even buy pads for his own girlfriend. He got mad and went out. I had to bunch up toilet paper as a makeshift pad, wear black pants and a long cardigan and go buy the pads myself. My boyfriend has been ignoring me ever since. I\u2019ve been thinking that maybe I might\u2019ve pushed it too far. So AITA for telling my boyfriend that his masculinity was fragile after he refused to buy pads for me? *Edit*: *Wow, thank you for all your replies! I\u2019m definitely going to have a serious talk with my boyfriend in the morning about this and we\u2019ll see how it goes* **UPDATE**: First off, thank you for all your awards, replies and stories, they all mean so much to me. I confronted my boyfriend an hour ago. We sat down together and I told him that I didn\u2019t like how he acted about buying pads for me. He said that he didn\u2019t feel like he had to, and that I could\u2019ve \u201cheld it in\u201d and drove to the drugstore to get the pads myself. I told him that you can\u2019t \u201chold in\u201d menstrual blood, but he insisted that I could\u2019ve done it for a few minutes and that it wouldn\u2019t be a big deal. We went back and forth over this so I just dropped it.  I asked him (like most of you mentioned) what would happen when we have kids and he\u2019d have to take care of me and buy me nipple cream, take me to the washroom, etc. He said that I would not need those things because I should be able to do them on my own after giving birth. He said that there wasn\u2019t anything hard about using the bathroom and the only reason I\u2019d need help is if I was a \u201ccripple\u201d. Then I asked him about the tr***y comment. He said that he didn\u2019t understand why people would want to change the gender they were born in. That basically cemented everything for me. I felt completely betrayed and humiliated.  I can\u2019t believe I spent two years of my life with a guy who holds these views, and I can\u2019t believe I was too oblivious to it. I just feel so dumb. I told him that we need to break up. He cussed at me and told me that I was exaggerating and that I was being a bitch. I told him that I would send him my half of this month\u2019s rent (we live together but it was his appartement so we would split the bill). Then I packed my bags and drove to my parents house without saying another word. I\u2019m gonna be staying with my parents until I sort myself out. I\u2019m feeling really down right now, because I really did love him, but I also feel relieved. Again, thank you all for helping me out, and sending me encouraging messages. I appreciate it all.",

        "selftext": "Hi there, this is my first post and this is a throw away. I am a 30 year old white woman with thick curly brown hair (3c if you know what that means).  I have always struggled with my hair and was adopted into a family of people with straight hair who couldnt care for my hair properly leading to huge knots and regularly get my hair massacred by scissors to make it short to be easier to deal with. When i went to uni i met my best friend who is black and has a similar hair type to me and when noticing my struggle helped me out. She showed me hair products from brands intended for black people that really helped with my hair quality and even took me to the salon she went to that catered for black hair types. My hair has been amazing ever since, theyve been the only people to understand how to care for my hair and make it look nice.  Well onto the actual argument, me and some friends from work went out for dinner and we were talking about our hair and i commented that i go to a salon that specialises in black haircare. One of the women ( also white) commented that it was inappropriate for me as a white woman to take advantage of black products and services that should only be used by black people. When i asked why she said that its kind of cultural appropriation. The others there agreed with her and i felt uncomfortable ever since. I dont know if she is right and if i am in the wrong, i dont even know what id do if it was wrong as i dont want to go back to the salons that butchered my hair before.",

She was in class and suddenly felt like she was going to vomit so she tried to run to the bathroom. She didn\u2019t make it and vomited in the hallway. However she was sent to the office for running out of class without permission. The principal called me about this and I had to come in. He told me that she was being punished and was losing her privileges to go on the field trip the next week. I told him that was insane considering she did it because she was trying to keep from making a mess and she\u2019s 7! She made a snap judgement that I think most people would make. On top of that, they sent her to the principal instead of the nurse. He refused to change the decision so I took my daughter out of school for the last 2 days of the week. Since she was missing the field trip I wanted her to have as much fun as possible so we went to an amusement park, the movies, and to paint pottery. She told her father about this during his visitation time and he got very angry at me for undermining the principal. AITA?",

        "selftext": "That\u2019s the actual quote. I\u2019m still pissed as hell but maybe I went too far here.  My brother and I are both late 30s. We get along fine most of the time, but my brother doesn\u2019t do well in a lot of social situations. He says things that are inappropriate, gets overly opinionated, yells a lot etc.  He just doesn\u2019t seem to understand tact or when to let things go in a casual conversation.  Our wives are best friends. They talk almost everyday on FaceTime.  My wife is an ex model/actress (local) and very good with makeup.  She\u2019s in her mid 30\u2019s, we have 3 kids and she doesn\u2019t wear much makeup anymore - but she got some as a gift for Christmas and decided she wanted to get more. Apparently she\u2019s been buying cheap stuff and she wanted to splurge on some good shit.  Anyway, she\u2019s been testing it all out over the last month, buying more here and there and doing these crazy eyeshadow things - honestly I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m talking about. She looks great all the time. She\u2019s gorgeous without makeup. She\u2019s really talented with it though and she\u2019s having a lot of fun. I tease her a little since she works from home and she\u2019s wearing pajamas but her makeup looks like she\u2019s at a nightclub. I think it\u2019s cute and funny.  My brother thinks she\u2019s doing it because she\u2019s cheating or she wants to cheat. He called me this morning to say he\u2019s concerned because he\u2019s seen her on FaceTime and he\u2019s decided she must be posting pictures or sending pics to some dude or multiple dudes. I tried to blow it off and explain that it wasn\u2019t that way, but he got more aggressive about it so I ended up yelling at him and shouting the insecure testicle man baby thing.  He\u2019s being ridiculous and needs to mind his own business. But I think I might be the asshole for blowing up and name calling when he\u2019s probably well intentioned.  I want to add too (my mom and brother both asked, maybe other people will):  No, I haven\u2019t asked my wife why she\u2019s recently starting wearing more makeup and I\u2019m not going to because I think asking is fucking rude.  She\u2019s spending her money on stuff for her face and it\u2019s a creative hobby. I\u2019m not going to be the dick that ruins someone\u2019s creative outlet by asking them to justify it or by insinuating there\u2019s a sinister motive behind it.

        "selftext": "So I'm an engineer and I'm working on a team with 7 decently chill guys and one guy with anger issues. Like he can't just have a respectful disagreement, he'll raise his voice and yell and get up close to your face. I hate it. So I started by just complaining to my boss about it. And he brushed it under the rug saying he is just like that. And if I thought he was bad now I should of seen him 10 years ago before he mellowed out  It makes me wonder what he was like 10 years ago because he sure ain't mellow now.  It's also a small enough company that there's no HR, only the corporate management. Which didn't help.  So I took a different approach. I stopped calling him angry, or calling what he was doing arguing or yelling. I just swapped in the words emotional or throwing a tantrum or having a fit I was kinda hoping if I could shift his reputation from domineering (big man vibes) to emotional and tantrumming (weak sad baby vibes)  So I started just making subtle comments. Like if I had a meeting with him and he got a temper, I'd mention to the other people Wow, it's crazy how emotional Jay got. I dunno how he has the energy to throw a hissy fit at 9 am, I'm barely awake  Or when my boss asked me to recap a meeting he missed, I told him Dan, Jack, and James had some really great feedback on my report for (this client). Jay kinda had trouble managing his emotions and had a temper tantrum again, but you know how he gets.  Or when a coworker asked why he was yelling I'd say Honestly I don't even know, he was getting so emotional about it he wasn't speaking rationally.  I tried to drop it in subtly and some of my coworkers started picking it up. I don't think consciously, just saying stuff like Oh, another of Jay's fits or something. I got gutsy enough to even start saying to his face Hey, I can hardly understand what you're trying to explain when you're so emotional And again my coworkers started picking up on it and I even caught several of them telling him to get a hold of himself. After a while, he started to get a reputation as emotional and irrational. Which I could tell pissed him off. But he stopped yelling at me as much.  Anyway, he slipped once this week and I just said I really can't talk to you when you're being this emotional and he blew up at me asking why I was always calling him that. I shrugged and said dude you look like you're on the verge of tears, go look in the mirror before you ask me and he got really angry I suggested he might start crying. (That was a kinda flippant comment, he was red faced angry not tearful angry, and I could tell.)  I feel like a bit of a dick for being petty and trying to gaslight this guy into thinking everyone around him sees him like a crybaby.

There's a girl in one of my classes who's father was in the World Trade Center. He died. Of course, this is very sad, and I pity the man, but not her. She's extremely racist. She hates everyone who isn't white or east asian. But she especially hates Muslims due to her father's passing. So of course, we don't talk. But today, September 11, was the day she exploded. I was wearing a hijab. She told me I should take it off out of respect for the victims and that it was the equivalent of a hat. I said no.  She said that you Muslims did this, you need to take off the hijab to show respect.  I obviously told her no. Then she went on a very long Islamophobic rant that I can't entirely recall because this was hours ago. But I remember she concluded by saying that Islam took away her father, so she wants to take away Islam. (I'm still confused as to what she meant.) She made a few comments towards me, and I went on my phone to de escalate. She made more comments, I kept ignoring her. But then she said Yeah, you're not responding because you know I'm right. I don't know why that set me off, but it did.  I told her No, I'm just busy texting my DAD. She left the room in tears.

I figured it must be his mom walking in and snooping on my personal things.

So, I got me one of those fake postive pregnancy tests and threw it in the bedroom's trashcan. note the trashcan was placed in the corner near the closet.

My husband came over to my workplace and was all worked up about it asking since when I was pregnant, and why I didn't tell him. I asked how he found out and he said his mom found the positive test in the trashcan in the bedroom. I asked if his answer just confirmed that she's been snooping in the bedroom all along. He had a realization moment but demanded we stick to the bigger issue, I said there was no bigger issue because the positive test was fake and this whole thing was done to expose my MIL's snooping. he was not convinced. he had me take an actual test right infront of him and he was livid asking how could I lie about such thing and break his mom's heart since I know...very well that she longs for kids.

After I while he started complaining about not getting help at all to raise his kids. He asked me to watch them on Sunday and step up as a grandparent. I told him the reason the village doesn\u2019t exist to raise his kids is due to him burning that village down. He called me a jerk and hung up.My husband is iffy on the situation but told me it\u2019s my call since I would be the one to watch the kids most of the time since he travels often for work.

        "selftext": "I (20m) has two younger siblings, Joe and Jill. They're twins, both 18 and graduating high school this year. Jill is my parent's favorite, because they've always wanted a daughter, while Joe is their scapegoat, because I guess he's the bonus baby they never actually asked for. I'm mostly better off than Joe, as I'm the oldest grandson from both sides of my family, almost all of whom are just as blantant as my parents are about their favoritism. I felt really bad for Joe, so I did what I could to make him feel less alone. Like when Jill got to go shopping with mommy and daddy, I took Joe skating with my friends. When our parents were too busy watching Jill's kiddie pageant, I dragged my best bud to sit through Joe's elementary school musical. Small things like that. It all started as pity moves, but soon my friends pretty much like Joe better than me, while Jill's princess syndrome got in her head, so now I spend more time with Joe because I simply like him better than Jill. Never said it out loud, but I don't make it a secret either that I prefer not to spend my time with entitled brats. Anyway, like I said they're graduating soon. They both already had their choice of college, accomodations, etc. Jill's going to a uni in SF, fully funded by our parents, unsurprisingly. Joe's going to the same Uni as mine in Seattle, but different campus just 20ish minutes away. He got a full ride, which apparently makes him ineligible to get any financial help from his own parents. This is also hardly surprising, so I made some calls to ask around, see if anyone is hiring next fall. I did this while on facetime with Joe. I was reassuring him that we'll find him a job that don't suck and pays enough, that he's better off without dad's money anyway because we both know it comes with strings attached, that this way, mom and dad wouldn't be able to stick their noses into his purchases. I got him to feel better about the whole thing and logged off. I guess Jill overheard, because the next day she sent me texts after texts demanding I help her find jobs as well because she doesn't want dad nagging her. When I told her, politely btw, that I don't know anyone in SF, and that she'd get more help from mom and dad, she blew up, saying all these things about me favoring Joe over her, which, yeah. It's true. I love both of my siblings, but I don't particularly like Jill. It's not like she's making herself likeable, though, so AITA?",

The stipulations were continuing good grades, good attitude, she could only bring one friend with her somewhere (to begin with), we had to know where she was, and the obvious two: don't drink & drive, and don't text and drive.  We made it clear that **we** were buying the car, but it was for her to use. We got the car, a 2012 Honda Civic. She has a summer job right now, it's summer break so she's out doing stuff with her friends, etc. In a few months she will be off to college. Everything was going swimmingly. Until someone on that NextDoor app started posting pictures and videos of bad drivers in the area. And lo and behold, my daughter was posted with her face down as she texted and rolled through a stop sign. Once with her face down in her phone at a stoplight. I was livid. My wife was the one who showed it to me. We found out there were more instances (from her Instagram Stories) and we decided... no. Wife and I up and sold the car. We didn't lose very much in the process, except of course our daughter completely came unraveled. It's so unfair, I didn't hurt anyone, everyone's doing it, how am I supposed to get to work, what about when I go to college? Well, we said no, it's not unfair, you hurt us by being a shitty, irresponsible driver, no, not everyone's doing it, you can walk, ride your bike, or take the bus, and as for college, you don't need the car to get to and from classes, and again, ride your bike or walk. She tried to play the how can you send your daughter to college without her safety in mind? card and I said Well, well, well, now you're concerned about safety? and she just up and screamed.  This has everyone in our life up in arms and divided. Her grandparents think we're being over the top and awful, that grounding her would have sufficed. They've threatened that THEY will buy her a car again if we try to send her to college without one.  The car is already sold, so there's no going back. I think what we did was absolutely correct, that actions have consequences and we would be in the wrong to pull back from that. In terms of her going to college? Well, she made that choice. She had a car, it came with certain stipulations, she disobeyed us, and now she pays the price.  So AITA?",

But turns out they also invited her husband\u2019s side of the family.  When it was time to get in the pool, I changed into my swim trunks and removed my shirt. But my sister stopped me before I came out their house and asked to keep my shirt on because of my scars. She was referring to the scars from when I had my top (chest) surgery. I\u2019m a trans guy. Had started transitioning 8 yrs ago and my surgery was 4 years ago. My scars have already faded and they\u2019re pretty well hidden under my pecs. You\u2019d have to look really close to even notice.  I\u2019ve been to their pool many times and she\u2019s never said anything before so I was surprised. Every other guy including my dad were all shirtless in the pool.  When I asked what the prob was with my scars she said she was uncomfortable with her in laws knowing I\u2019m trans. My feelings were hurt but I was mainly pissed. She said she didn\u2019t want her in laws to look at her differently if they found out about me.  She told me not to make a big deal and to go with it.  When she left, I went back inside to change because i wasn\u2019t gonna go in the pool with a shirt on. I only had the one I came wearing because I didn\u2019t expect her to ask me this.  My mood was soured after that and I didn\u2019t wanna be around her so I decided to leave. When I said bye to everyone they were all confused since I was only there less than an hour. My dad pulled me aside and asked why I was leaving early.  I told him to ask my sister and left. An hour later my sister called me upset because she and my dad got into a fight.  My parents were furious about what she told me and they ended up leaving early too. Now she\u2019s angry at me for ruining the bbq and said I didn\u2019t have to cause all this drama if I only did what she asked. What she said hurt me and I was no longer in a mood to be around her or anyone else, but I didn\u2019t mean for all that to happen.

My ex husband's girlfriend tried to get involved in my parenting several times, she even commented on my son's name implying that we should agree on a name we all want not just what I wanted, and tried to dictate what he should and shouldn't have. As a result she started throwing stuff of his that I paid for myself. Honestly it's frustrating because I'm barely getting by with the money I have and can not afford to buy replacement for all the stuff she throws put but my ex husband says it's her house and she gets to decide what can and can't enter. I made a crochet blanket for my son with his name on it. This blanket is special to me, and the tools I used to be able to make it cost me money. Not to mention the time and effort it took to get it down. I sent my son to stay with his dad days ago, and he wanted to take the blanket with him to sleep with it. I don't know exactly what happened, but when I came to pick him up he told me his dad's girlfriend took it away from him and threw it out leaving him with no blanket to sleep with at night as punishment for him for not accepting the one she offered. I was furious. I called his dad but he hung up on me, I sent him a text explaining the situation, but he texted back telling me that I should stop the drama and go look for a job if I have so much free time on my hand instead of picking on his girlfriend. I felt frustrated I visited his family who are good to me and told them about what their son's girlfriend did, now it's worth mentioning that she's been working hard for their approval and to get on their good side. They were shocked to know about what she did they all flipped out on her and started calling her out. My SIL took it further by putting this on social media which made other family members see what she did. My ex husband called me yelling about my pathetic attempt to turn his family against his girlfriend. I could hear her freaking out in the background while he was lashing out at me saying I ruined every chance she had to have a good relationship with her future inlaws. I hung up and felt absolutely horrible, even though I was just venting to his family about what happened and felt frustrated. Maybe I shouldn't have told them? I'm not sure anymore since the whole family aren't speaking to her si that might have epa lasting impact on their relationship with her.",

He was just raised by his mother, who had abandoned him and later died (no adoptive family). As an adult, I've looked into both trees and our biological ancestors are, to put it mildly, really dangerous people and/or dead. My late husband and older son died in a car crash. My daughter is in kindergarten and she, more accurately me, was supposed to do a family tree project for school. I tried speaking to her teacher that this was not going to be a Pollyanna report, but she is one of those people that can't comprehend that sometimes family is a dark subject, and insisted that it needed to be biological. So, I did it. Some of them, like her father and my son, I have actual information for aside from that they're dead. But for most of my family and her paternal family, I literally only have birth date, death date, when they would have had their kids, and cemetery information, unless they were cremated. It was supposed to have 10 pictures, but most of the pictures I have of any ancestors are just headstones. I made a trip when my husband and I first married to take pictures of the headstones, so I included those in there. I only have 3 pictures total of my biological family, and most of them are group shots where I could only label maybe 3 people. I don't have any pictures of my late husband's family from before me and my kids, but I put some of the old ones in there too. So while the other kids had long family trees, my daughter was basically introducing the concept of death to her kindergarten class. Now I'm getting slammed with calls from other parents, the teacher, and the principal. They're appalled that I allowed such a morbid report and are saying I traumatized their children. I don't think I did anything wrong. They wanted a report on her biological ancestors, I gave it, and kept it G-rated. I just didn't lie that people were alive when they weren't. I don't raise her to think that death is taboo or something to be ashamed of anyway. Death is part of life. Most of her/my family is dead, so talking about family just means talking about death, and it's just something you have to accept. AITA?",

        "selftext": "About two months ago, my husband and I got \u201cmarried\u201d in a beautiful ceremony. It was SO MUCH FUN. We went on a honeymoon after. The price tag makes me wheeze, but my parents were insistent on paying for 95% of it, saying it\u2019s their only daughter\u2019s wedding. As a result, the wedding was way more fancy than something my husband or I could afford! My husband and I paid the rest \u2014 his family did not contribute (which is fine!).  The wedding was lovely, but missing one piece - the marriage license. About a year and a half ago, I was going through some serious health issues (the issues are resolved now, thankfully!). I had recently graduated from school and didn\u2019t have health insurance. My husband and I decided to get married so I could join his health insurance. It was a quick Justice of the Peace ceremony. We were always planning to have a ceremony at some point in the future. A few months after that, he \u201cproposed\u201d (something I didn\u2019t see coming!), the wedding occurred, and here we are today, planning for kids.  Very few people knew we got legally married about a year and a half ago. We weren\u2019t trying to be deceptive. However, part of it was that I wasn\u2019t comfortable revealing my health issues. My husband respected this. My parents knew about our legal marriage, but his mother did not. His mom (I\u2019ll call her Carol) and I aren\u2019t close. She\u2019s fine enough in low doses, but... We\u2019re currently in the process of moving. This past weekend, his mother came to help us pack up things. As we were packing files (birth certificate, social security cards, etc.), somehow our marriage license must\u2019ve slipped out. Carol picked it up and kept insisting we need to frame it. And then she noticed the date.  Carol lost it. She insisted we lied to everyone. She said our wedding ceremony was just a \u201cgift grab\u201d (our wedding website stated that someone\u2019s presence was gift enough\u2014 we still got many generous gifts and we are forever grateful). Carol went and called her twin sister, my husband\u2019s aunt, and the sister called and lashed out at us. She said we were sneaky and deceptive. She is saying she may want her gift back\u2014something we are fine with giving her.  For me and my husband, the legal wedding was just so I could get insurance. A means to an end. Our wedding date is what we will celebrate. Are we assholes for not being more upfront? I\u2019ve been really upset and confused and waffle back and forth. My husband insists we are not assholes.",

        "selftext": "Throwaway because I don't want my family tracking this back to my main. My sister got knocked up by her boyfriend right out of highschool, got married the next year, then proceeded to pop out another baby every year or two, so she has four now at 24. She's a stay at home mom even though she was brilliant and could have gotten a free ride to a great University. Since hers are the only grandkids, our parents fawn over her like she's the next coming of Christ. They gush over over every new tooth or haircut like it's some huge achievement. Problem is, her husband's business wasn't great even even before COVID, and is barely limping along now. Sister doesn't work, and my parents have limited income. So guess who's constantly being told to lend them money for shit like school fees, car seat, car payment, new  stroller, etc. They don't even ask! My mom just texts me your sister needs $X.XX for the kids and I'm supposed to cough up. If I complain, they accuse me of being  jealous because I don't have a husband and family even though I'm older (I'm only 26!) So over Easter I notice my sister isn't drinking and I think oh god, here we go again. Sure enough, she stands up and announces that she's been inseminated with yet another precious miracle.  Everyone's gushing and I just try to stay quiet and out of the way.  Later she asks me if everything's alright and I try to play it off but she pushes so I asked her if she and her husband could really afford another baby. She very snippily replies God will provide like he has so far, which really pissed me off. I yelled that no, actually god didn't provide for her babies, **I** did, and I wasn't going to giving them any more handouts. It devolved into a big argument with everyone shouting at me, and basically I've been banned from my family unless I apologize. I haven't apologized.  It's been radio silence except for one text from my mom saying that if my sister miscarries it's my fault for stressing her out. I asked if my sister was showing any symptoms but no one will answer or tell me. IDK. I don't think I'm TA but I don't want to be the reason she miscarries. Also, I think I might be TA because secretly I think it would be better if she did even though I wouldn't say that to her.",

        "selftext": " My biological (12yo) daughter ~ Susan likes to collect and read old children's books. She's become incredible reader. She had problems with reading and learning before and we were advised to encourage her to read and eversince she started reading (which she does regularly) her skills improved. she also reads to her 2yo sister everynight. I have a (16yo), stepson ~ Levi who can be a hothead sometimes. We don't have a son~dad relationship but I respect him and he respects me though he can act quite mean and selfish towards me and his sisters. He'd throw away stuff that belongs to us over small arguments and teases Susan for spending a lot of time to read calling her grandma. My wife and I discussed his behavior and had conversations and agreed on punishments but Levi'd go to his dad's place whenever he causes troubles then have his dad yell at me for wanting to discuss a suitable punishment. Then Levi comes home days later expecting me to let go of what he did everytime, it's frustrating. I got a call at work from Susan saying Levi took her entire book collection and threw them in the pool after she refused to lend him and his friends her camera for his trip. My wife helped get them out but they were wet and some were torn. It was horrific because some of those books are hard to get and meant a lot to Susan as a part of her life.I was so mad at Levi I came home to have a conversation with my wife to decide on a punishment but he already packed a small bag and went to his dad's, I asked my wife how could she let him basically run after doing this and she said he called his dad and he came to pick him up after Susan said that I was coming home to deal with the problem. I went to his dad's house and he refused to let me see him. I told him how Levi was hiding from consequences and his dad tried to justify why Levi was acting out by blaming me for how me and Susan treat him. He even said he'd get CPS involved if I ever try to punish him because I'm not his dad, I have no right. Adding what Levi did was a reaction to my daughter being mean to him. He told me to leave because Levi won't come home til I promise not to do anything about what he did and put it in writing. I told him Levi should stay there with him then. He's not to come back til ~he~ get proper punishment.His dad argued it's his mom's house too and called my wife and she asked to let this go and we'll figure out some way to resolve it but I don't think it's fair for Susan to have her books ruined and Levi getting away with it. They're asking me to let it go but this will only encourage Levi to do worse if I don't deal with it now.It's been 2 weeks and my in-laws say I was out of line for banning Levi from coming home and are telling me to step back but I refused. EDIT ~ Levi's dad thinks that because I'm not his bio dad then I have no right to punish him for whatever he does in the house. In the past his dad caused issues when I used to take Levi's electronics (that his dad bought) as punishment. Then I got talked out of punishing him everytime he did something unacceptable wether to me or his sisters. I've arranged for family therapy but Levi's dad refused to let him go. EDIT ~ I'd like to mention that my inlaws said that Levi is willing to apologize to Susan and so this should be enough to get this over with but I kept saying no and for that I'm being considered at fault.",

This acc is just for privacy reasons -I always had good grades in high-school, was home on time, cleaned the house etc. I never had problems with my parents before this.  -I went to med school, still living with parents when I was 20, I dated someone who was 23 -Dad was against this because be does not believe in dating people far older than you (so like don't date far from your own age)  and says I cannot date J.  -Argument breaks out, Dad says it's his house so either I agree or I move out. I say it's not fair as J has a job, goes to college, has future plans etc. Dad kicks me out. Mom agrees with his decision. Little bro was only 14 at the time.  -I moved with J, his family was supportive, helped me with my college (I went to another college due to financial reasons), finished my required years but still kept in touch with my lil bro -Years later, me and J (with the help of his parents) got a small house. (Like really small but I'm happy with it). I ended up giving birth to a sweet baby girl. I let my lil bro know that he could come see her when he was able to.  He came a few times.  -Today, bro came to see the baby, and asked when I was going to let mom and dad see her since they wanted to reconnect. I said never and that I wasn't going to forgive them. Bro says I'm being unreasonable as they were just strict and trying to protect me, I say that's bullshit because Dad shouldn't have kicked me out over age. Bro says I should at least let Mom come because she didn't want to agree with it. I say Mom was able to do something but didn't,but that Bro's situation was different because he was only 15. Bro is upset because he says Mom and Dad regret their decision and just want to reconnect and that I am dragging this entire situation. I told him that if he thinks I'm 'dragging it out' then he can stay out of my life too. He's angry and says that I need to move on and that I shouldn't be withholding them from seeing THEIR grandchild. I say that THEY disowned me and so have no grandchild from a daughter that doesn't exist.  AITA? I don't hate my bro and I (kinda)  get what he is saying, but I just have a resentment for my parents. It's not like I had a baby just to put it against them,  but my lil bro thinks I'm going go die on a hill with them for something done several years ago and it's petty. I'm curious on what reddit thinks. I want a relationship with my bro, just not my mom and dad",

        "selftext": "I am in college and my roommate from last year, Meg, who's family is really rich, said she could bring a friend on vacation. It was kinda awkward, I was her third choice but her family vetoed the first two because they didn't want her bringing a boy or this other female friend of hers they disliked. Her parents bought my plane ticket and booked the resort which I was very grateful for and I saved a lot of money up so I could make sure I buy my own food and activities when I'm there, and treat her family to a dinner as a thank you for the ticket. But when the trip started, it was just bad. It was her, me, her mother, her father, two of her father's friends, and her three brothers going.  On the flight, they all got first class and got me a economy seat. But I didn't say anything because why argue about a free ticket? The first night they went to a grocery, it turns out they wanted to cook at the resort kitchen for the whole trip  And by they wanted to cook it actually turned out that they wanted me and Meg to cook. I wasn't warned about this but it turns out Meg's family is sooo traditional that they see cooking as a women's job. And her mom had just had hand surgery. So it was me and Meg cooking every meal for six men and her mom. And I can't cook well. I know a couple staple meals to feed myself but since I rarely eat meat I don't know how to cook it. I'm also ok at cooking for 1 or 2 but have no practice cooking for a group of 9 I screwed it up, undercooked chicken, and overcooked some steak and her dad was angry with me. I got short with him and told him that if he knew how to do better he could pitch in instead of standing around criticizing. But he got furious and said he was on his vacation. I said that I was trying to have a vacation too, or did they invite me to be an unpaid domestic servant?  Meg's parents and dad's friends got angry I said that and started yelling at me. The argument escalated, I sarcastically called myself the help His dad snapped at me and told me to get out of their suite and go home. Didn't say shit about how he expected me to do that. I left and called the airline with my ticket, and asked them if they could do anything to prevent anyone else from modifying or cancelling my ticket. They let me set a passcode, and no changes could be made to the flight without it.   Then I went to the resort desk to ask about rooms, saying I was stranded unexpectedly. They actually did have some affordable rooms available because of a weekday discount. So I got housing and still had money left over for touristy stuff.  I went sightseeing and relaxed on the beach for three days, until Meg's parents ran into me. They were taking a sunset walk and did a double take seeing me on the beach. They said they thought I was going home, and I said I decided to stay. They were angry because they saw me staying and using the return flight as having deceived them into thinking I couldn't afford a vacation, and using them for flights when I could actually afford things.  AITA for staying on that vacation and using the flight home? ,,,,",

        "selftext": "When I was 25, we found out that my father had been cheating on my mother for years and he had a 7 year old daughter with his mistress. In one split second, the happy family I knew was gone, and I went through the darkest time in my life. My parents divorced and per their prenup, my mother walked away with most of their assets (since she also contributed more to the family income). She never forgave my dad for what he did and never talked to him again, though she grudgingly allowed me to have whatever relationship I wanted to have with him. I eventually forgave my dad mostly because I was tired of carrying so much anger and hurt in my heart. I talk to him but I want nothing to do with his mistress or my half sister. My mother died last year and left me everything - her money, her real estate assets, and her business, which I now own and operate. I am in a relatively comfortable financial position, while my dad is... getting by. He was never a good businessman on his own and lost a lot of his money on businesses that later went belly up. This year my half sister was diagnosed with a life threatening sickness, and she has been in the hospital for the last four months. The bills are mounting and my dad came to me for help because they are now in a situation where they are finding it difficult to come up with money for my half sister's treatment. The thing is, I don't want to use my mother's money to pay for the treatment of the child her husband had with his other woman. Though it's not my half sister's fault, it feels so unfair when I think that the money my mother worked hard all her life for will go to a child that neither my mother and I have any responsibility towards, and the very same child of the man and the woman who hurt her so much at that. I'd really rather use it to grow her company and let my dad and my half sister's mother figure out how to get money for her treatment. They are her parents after all. The only thing tying me to her is my father saying She is your sister and If she dies because she didn't get the treatment she needs, would you be able to sleep at night? AITA?",

Ngl most of my mom\u2019s family is high key racist and is been problems sometimes growing up. My grandma on my mom\u2019s side never liked my dad and was happy after they divorced when I was 7. My names Emiliano and my grandma always complained how hard she tried to change my parents minds and it\u2019s a shame I got stuck with it. I\u2019m actually proud of it. My dad told me about the revolutionary I was named after and their history. But literally my entire life my grandma refuses to say it. She says it\u2019s \u201ctoo many syllables\u201d (i got a cousin named Alexandria and they say the whole name) and always came up with her own names. She says Leo or once tried to get everyone to call me \u201cElliot\u201d as a nickname for a while. Obvious my moms family was for it but my dad refused that cause it\u2019s not my name.  Is always the same thing when I see them. She\u2019ll call me Leo or whatever. Even when I correct her she says it\u2019s not a big deal an keeps calling wrong name. I told my mom I don\u2019t like it but she always say I\u2019m just not gonna change her mind and no point in fighting it. So I decided if she not gonna wanna call me by my actual name in not gonna call her grandma or say her right name. Is stupid I know but it\u2019s bothering me more that she don\u2019t care and all my other cousins she says their names fine, no nicknames.  Her name is Susan so I decided to call her Sandy.   Tbh I was scared to say it but that look on her face was worth it lmao. It wasn\u2019t surprise Pikachu face but it was close. She said that is not how I address her and it\u2019s \u201cgrandma\u201d. I told her nah I\u2019mma call her sandy from now until she says my actual name. It got awkward. My mom was serious and my gma got super red in the face. She started ranting about me being a fucking disrespectful child and this is all my dad influencing me again. My mom told me I need to apologize immediately but idk what gave me the balls to not do it. We ended up leaving there house early and my mom didn\u2019t talk to me until we got home.  She say what I did was outta line and I don\u2019t disrespect my elders ever. She wants me to apologize and I\u2019m grounded until I do. Haven\u2019t talked to my dad yet about this since it just happened but I wanted to ask if it was being an asshole or was it okay for this situation to \u201cinsult my grandmother\u201d ?",

He wanted the new truck and our savings. I wanted the old trailer and the land. My ex and I have 2 girls (8&7).Since my divorce. I slowly started buying old single wides and restoring them. Turning it into a business. I love it.  My girls go to their dads and AP apartment  every other weekend. I started noticing their clothes, electronics, toys were not coming home. At first I thought their dad was just keeping a few outfits there for them. However, my 8 yr. old got upset when she was packing. I asked her what was wrong. She told me her dad takes her clothes and sells them on line. That she doesn\u2019t want to take her favorite shirt over there. I immediately called my ex. I asked him to return our daughters clothes. Not wanting to throw my daughter under the bus. I blamed it on them not having enough for school. He played dumb. He said he got rid of the clothes that were too small. I pointed out that the jeans our (7 yr.) had were brand new. He then said that it was only fair he got some cash because he owned the trailer and land. If it wasn\u2019t for him I wouldn\u2019t be doing this good. I was pissed. I took my daughters down to the dollar store and bought cheap shirts.To a thrift store and bought cheap shorts.We had a \u201cgirls\u201d tie dye night. Hot pink every thing. Each made 5 shirts and 5 bottoms. I let our girls design and decorate them. My girls loved it.  The following week Ex sends the girls home. I could tell he is mad but, he didn\u2019t say anything. The clothes were not returned. No fear I knew this would be a issue. We made extras. When the girls went back they were wearing tie dye. They were with their dad for a hour before he called and demanded different clothes. I kindly told him that our daughters love those clothes (they really really love tie dye). Ex get even angrier and said his parents have a major family party and the girls can\u2019t wear pink tie dye. I told him that he should go buy other clothes if he didn\u2019t want them to wear it. He called me an A for being petty.AITA?Edited to add. Thank you so much for all the comments. Here are some things to clarify.1) AP stands for Affair partner 2) owned is past tense. My ex is not on the land deed or the title to my trailer.3) sadly this is a true story. I am sorry for those who don\u2019t believe it. At the same time my heart goes out to those who shared your similar stories. Thank you for the love and support",

My daughter Judy F16 has never met them til very recently where they hosted dinner to celebrate 4th of july and that's when they met her for the first time. Judy has a visible burnscar on her forehead. It was due to an accident she was in when she was 9. She used tk be incredibly insecure about it. To the point where I was forced to home school her and it was hard trying to deal with and navigate through this rough time. Now she's doing a lot better though some comments can really cause her to become stressed out and anxious. My fiancee knows all that and respects it. Before we went to her parents house I asked her to tell them about Judy and her struggle and get to try and not say anything negative about it or possibly mention it. She said she would guarentee no one will say anything. We got to the event and they talked to Judy and she slowly warmed up to them. Everything was going well til I was dinner time. My FMIL looked at Judy while she was eating and pointed at her scar. Basically asking questions about it which made Judy lose her appetite and start to get uncomfortable. I kept sending my fiancee and her mom signs to knock it off but to no avail. Finally, FMIL then brought up the wedding and asked my fiancee if it'd be possible to photoshop the scar out of any wedding photos that will have Judy in them just in case they distract viewers. I was dumbfounded, fiancee said nothing just stared casually while nodding. I looked at Judy and it was clear this got to her. I leaned closer and asked if she was feeling uncomfortable and that we could leave if the answer was yes. She took her time then nodded and said yes, I'm feeling uncomfortable right now.I got up and told her to get ready cause we were leaving. My fiancee, her mom and the family started insisting we finish dinner and stay but I refused. I took Judy and got in the car and left before even talking to my fiance. Obviously, she was pissed. She called an was angry talking about how I disrespected her parents by taking Judy and leaving in the middle of dinnerand not even saying goodbye, i told her that Judy was feeling uncomfortable with FMILs comments and questions. She said Judy overreacted and is in need to go back to therapy if a simply mention of her scar caused her to react that way. I got tired of arguing and asked her to give us some time but she went on me and said that I have no respect for her and her family and that what I did was irrational and now she won't speak to me til I clear things up with her family after ruining their celebratory dinner.",

        "selftext": " Hi. I'm a new mom, had my son 5 weeks ago. my husband's parents have been staying with us and things have been super overwhelming. MIL has a habit of taking the baby and refusing to give him back to me. She'd say I'm deliberately ruining her time with him. My son needs feeding every 2hrs and she basically makes me beg her to hand him over to me so I could feed. last night at 10PM. MIL had my son in her arms while sitting on the couch with my husband and his dad. I was exhausted, the baby started crying. I told my MIL to hand him over to me so I could feed him. She refused and I kept asking. my husband starts talking about what a whinny little girl I was to complain that our son is receiving love and cuddles and how I'm using feeding as an excuse to keep the baby away from his mom. I ignored him and told his mom to hand over the baby. she refused and said I needed to wait a little longer. I got angry at this point, My husband said I could take the baby after I ask his mom nicely. This had me seething I meanly told his mom to stop being annoying and overbearing and hand him over to me. She looked at me shocked and hurt. She handed the baby over and ran into the guest room and my husband gave me a look than followed her and stayed inside to comfort her. He came into the room while I was feeding my son and started yelling about how disrespectful I was to speak to his mom this way and treat her poorly when all she's doing is showing our son more love than I do. I told him about how she's been taking the baby for hours and preventing me from feeding him properly. he said that 1, our son isn't an object for me to act like I own him and 2, his mom was doing nothing wrong and 3, I should've asked nicely instead of being a bi$ch to his mom and making her cry. I started crying and yelled that I'd go to my mom's place if his parents stay any longer and he yelled back saying shut the fuck up, you're only acting up cause you don't want my parents around! fuck's wrong with you? then walked out. I felt terrible thinking maybe I was rude to his mom but I also think that I'd hit my limits here.AITA for not asking her nicely like my husband wanted? Edit; some mistakes because my hands are a bit unsteady.",

        "selftext": "This might seem silly. I (24F) like wearing cheerful socks, since my uniform is all white (currently working as an phlebotomist), it usually cheers up the patients too.  I've spent a few years collecting strange socks, ones with sushi, pizza, corgis, cats, Nick Cage, etc. I think I had about 30 pairs. My boyfriend (29M) has always hated them, and thinks they're childish. So I agreed to only wear them to work, and never on dates or around his friends/family. I thought that was fair.  On boxing day his parents came over for coffee and gifts (just the 4 of us, which is allowed where I live, and keeping a solid 3 meters apart). I accidentally put on a pair of 'childish' socks, and his mother made a comment about it. I explained that I wear them to work to cheer people up, and she liked that. My boyfriend didn't.  The next day all my socks were gone, and the drawer was filled with plain black socks. I asked my boyfriend, and he told me he threw them away and purchased some more 'appropriate' socks, so I won't embarrass him in front of his parents again.  I told him that that's insane, they were mine and he had no right to throw them away. Not to mention that I spend quite some time collecting them.  So I made a list of the ones I remembered I had, and told him that I expect the same ones as a replacement. He told me that's completely unreasonable, and that it would take a lot of time/effort/money for him to find those specific pairs. I haven't changed my mind yet, they cost me a lot of time and effort to find too.  I think he's being controlling, he thinks I'm being unreasonable and demanding.  AITA? I think I might be an asshole for asking for the exact same pairs, I know that'll take a lot of effort to find. Edit: Thanks everyone for replying, I've realised that this might not be a 'normal' fight and am evaluating the relationship.",

I also have two stepbrothers who are younger and who I don't really interact with. My dad has a four bedroom house. So all the kids have a bedroom. When I went to visit last month, I was surprised with a renovated room. And by renovated I mean it was converted to an office with a couch that pulls out to a bed. It did look nice I suppose. Apparently my stepmother works from home and needed an office. I didn't cry or throw a tantrum. I slept in the room that weekend and have refused to stay the night since. I was really hurt and felt like I didn't matter. My mom tried to convince me to go back but gave up after I told her I was old enough to decide. My dad is stressing out and has apologized and said he'll change the room back but honestly, I'm done. This was the final thing that sealed the deal for me. I told him that as well. I told him I'll come for day visits and we can have dinners but I won't be staying overnight anymore. Was I the asshole? He did cry and I feel really shitty about it.

        "selftext": "My 7 year old daughter\u2019s doing virtual school in our living room recently. I heard her teacher address a girl named Kelly a few times, which stuck out to me because my daughter\u2019s class is only about 15 kids and I know them all by this point in the year.  A couple times more and I realized she was calling my daughter Kelly. My daughter\u2019s name is Keeley, pronounced Kee-Lee.  So after school was over I asked her if that had been happening all year in this teacher\u2019s class and she said it had and it really annoyed her. I asked her why she hadn\u2019t corrected the teacher if it annoyed her so much and she said she had repeatedly at the beginning of the year but the teacher kept calling her Kelly, so eventually she gave up on reminding her.  I sent the teacher a quick email explaining the misunderstanding but got no response. This teacher teaches a special subject (think music, gym, art, or language), not just one grade level, so my daughter will be in her classes for the next several years, so we couldn\u2019t just wait it out. And how moments like these are handled now will set the stage for how my kid deals with similar situations on her own in the working world.  I encouraged my daughter to come to class early or stay late her again, thinking maybe she hadn\u2019t heard or understood her last time, so a quiet one on one would be better. She got to the class early and she told her very politely that her name was \u201cKeeley like really, instead of Kelly like jelly\u201d and that people often get it confused so she just wanted to clarify. So class starts and sure enough she gets called Kelly again almost immediately. So there\u2019s only so much self advocation a seven year old can be expected to do. I just walked over and said \u201cHi, this is *Keeley\u2019s* Dad. Her\u2019s name not Kelly. It\u2019s Keeley. Hard E. Sorry for any confusion.\u201d  A few hours later I had an email in my inbox \u201cinviting\u201d my wife and I to a parent teacher conference with the vice principle.  The long and short of the meeting ended up being the school feels that while the teacher probably should\u2019ve learned her name, that the real problem is she feels I challenged her authority by correcting her in class and that the names were \u201csimilar enough\u201d for it to \u201cnot have warranted such drastic action.\u201d That surprised me. I couldn\u2019t believe a meeting was necessary, let alone that it cast blame on us.  I can\u2019t tell if I\u2019m being that annoying \u201cmy kid matters most\u201d parent that my grandmother the schoolteacher always complained about or if the teacher should just learn her damn name because that\u2019s a basic part of her job.

        "selftext": "My (29f) parents have always been in financial trouble, something that I have never been able to understand because they both have a really generous salary (more than three times my own). Because of these financial troubles, my auns, uncles, and grandma have had over the years to lend them money, we were evicted a couple of times (that I know), we have had the water, the electricity and the internet cut... Many things that over the years I admit have affected my emotional and mental health. All of this has made my relationship with my parents very difficult over the years, more when they would take advantage of me making me pay for many things with the money that I earned working during holidays to pay for college or making me call my grandma to ask her for money, all of it while my mum used to spend money whenever she could in purses or jewellery . In the moment I became an adult because they started to sign on the bills under my name without my permission mostly because their credit was so bad that the companies wouldn't allow them to sign with their own names. When I figured it out I asked them to stop but they just lied about it and I just let it go because I couldn't deal with it. Fast forward to the present, because of the 'rona situation, I was looking forward the money from my income tax return, because my salary has gone down so this money would have helped a lot. Instead of it, I received a letter from a courthouse saying that the money has been confiscated. I immediately phoned my mum and she said that she didn't know anything about it but she will fix it. Since I don't trust her at all I called the court myself and then they explained me that during the last year there has been a proccess against me by a company I owe money from unpaid bills. All the papers had been sent to my parents and they had sign and take them. The debt was not paid with the money from the tax income so part of my salary from now on will be confiscated too until is fully paid. So my parents stole my identity to contract a bill under my name, didn't pay for it and when the company claim that debt through lawyers and a judge they kept all the papers from me (which is also illegal) apparently waiting for all of it to be fixed by itself. My mother said that it was her right to put it under my name because I am her daughter and it is my duty to help with the family burdens. Since then, and after really nasty words from her side and my sister's (who says that I am ungrateful and selfish) I haven't spoken to them and I am in the middle of a global pandemic with my salary already low, paying for a debt that it is not mine. My friends and boyfriend say that I should talk with the police and stop all of this because otherwise they will keep doing it and I am afraid they will. So, WIBTA if I speak with the court even if it means that my parents (70 and 63) could go to jail?

        "selftext": "My older brother (OB) is... a bit of a bum. It's mean to say but it's true. He can never hang onto a job for longer than a couple years max and when he inevitably loses whatever job he had he starts mooching off family and friends until he can find another job months later. This entails him freeloading at their place, eating their food, using their stuff, etc. He's lost friends because of how long he bummed off of them and I don't blame them for cutting him off. Well this last time he lost his job he went to our parents but they didn't have room because they were letting our eldest brother's (EB) family stay with them after he and SIL lost their jobs out of nowhere within the same month (EB's entire crew was laid off with zero warning and SIL's work burned down) and they couldn't afford the home they were renting anymore. So OB was pretty much SOL. So our parents, aunt, and uncle all started calling me asking if I'd take him in just long enough so he could get on his feet again. I (stupidly) let myself feel bad for him and said okay, but he only had a few months to get another job or he was out on the street. They all said of course, of course and so he came to stay with me. And it was a nightmare. He's a slob. He NEVER washes dishes, never washes his clothes, and eats pretty much whatever he wants. I guess since I'm his little sister he figured he could ignore me saying to get his shit together. Well after 6 months I told him he had to go. And gave him a couple weeks to find somewhere else. Well it seems he called our parents and cried about me kicking him out and they told him he knew he couldn't stay forever but they also ofc called my aunts/uncle and told them all about it. And my busybody aunt called me and scolded me for being cruel to my brother and abandoning family when they need help. I let her talk and finally said she was right, helping family was important and I'm glad she showed me that. She seemed glad I understood the right thing to do before hanging up. So I followed her advice and packed my bro up and drove him to her house. I couldn't take care of him anymore (he was running all my bills up) but my aunt made a good point, family should help each other. So I dropped him off there (she has room since all her kids moved out) and then left. But I wasn't even halfway home before I was getting multiple calls from my parents and aunt. Parents were demanding to know why our aunt was blowing up their phones and aunt was leaving voicemails shouting at me to come back and get my brother. I explained to my parents and they said it was a good idea since aunt sounded like she wanted to help but my aunt called me an asshole and said she didn't want my brother there. And when I told her family helps each other she called me a cunt. Last I checked he's still living with her. AITA? - Sorry for my lack of replies! I answered what ones I could before I left for work and when I got back I had far too many to answer. Lots of people have been asking similar questions so I thought answering them here once would be helpful. 1. My brother doesn't work menial jobs, he's not just hopping from one minimum wage job to another. He's working Very Good paying jobs. Like electronic repair, automotive maintenance, etc. He's very skilled but lazy.2. No my aunt hasn't spoken to me since she called me a cunt then hung up on me.3. My brother has only been with her about 3-ish weeks. He stayed with me for 6-7 months.4. My brother was upset I was kicking him out initially but in a better mood when he realized I had another place lined up for him to stay. Not sure how they're doing together since I haven't talked to either since after I dropped him off.5. No my aunt isn't married anymore, her and my uncle got divorced and he lives with his new wife (but I heard from dad that he thought this all was hilarious). - Edit 2 - To everyone who has been hounding me through PM and in the comments, my brother isn't (last time we checked) neurodivergent nor does he have ADD or ADHD. Our mom took him to the doctor more than once around when he was 15-17 when his behavior was at its worst.  According to our mom the doctors all said he was perfectly healthy and fine, though they (the doctors) suggested he wasn't being mentally stimulated enough (aka he was bored?). Mom wanted to take him to see other doctors but by then he'd turned 18 and refused to go and she couldn't force him. Also its been suggested he maybe see a doctor now but my OB doesn't seem at all interested. He's never had the highest respect for doctors or mental illness. He treats it like it's fake. When our baby sister was diagnosed with an ED when she was 19 he just cracked a joke about her just wanting a doctor's note so she could eat more...",

        "selftext": "For context, this year was the first time we would try the elf on the shelf with our kids. We have 3 kids, Lucas (9M), Andy (8M), and Claire (5F). Where Lucas and Andy are from our past relationships. However, Miles (my husband M37) has accepted Andy as his, and so did I (F35) with Lucas. Every Christmas is special for Andy, his bd is on Dec/24.  His dad started a tradition where Santa would've consideration with him for being a kid of Christmas. So he feels magical and special. I always try to give him that. Last year, i left Santa Claus footsteps, ate a carrot and grass he left for Rudolf. Stuff like that. My husband doesn't think it's a good idea i do all that for him, and I'm showing favoritism. So, we should shut it down, because of my ex's decision to create a tradition without considering my other kid's feelings. I disagree since i do consider the 3 of them. But he asked if we could so smth else, like the Elf on the shelf. I had no problem with it, but I didn't know how that works. He explained me quickly, and since he was the one who offered, i let him do it. We bought the cute Elf. My kids named it Bob. Later my husband explained them they should behave, and never touch/hold Bob if they don't want it to be naughty. At first, it was cute to see them spy on Bob, try to see it fly each night. Andy was the most excited of all, i found him one night talking with it, asking it if Santa still remembered him. But my husband took seriously the Behave or Bob would be naughty part. Lucas was his first victim after he didn't do his chores. The next day, his face was drawn with sharpie markers. Then Claire, who touched Bob and her fave onesie was destroyed. Apparently, Bob had cut some pieces of it, while she was sleeping. Miles was having fun, but i could see my kids weren't. I talked to him about how we should lower the pranks, he agreed but wanted to catch Andy since he hadn't break any rules. I told him that Bob's supposed to tell Santa instead of being naughty. We argued but he finally agreed. Fast forward, it's Christmas Eve and in the afternoon we had some of Andy's friends to celebrate his bd. So the kids were playing in backyard. But my husband looked sus. I decided to look for Bob. It was supposed to be in the kitchen but it wasn't there, I asked Miles where it was and he told me no idea. I started getting paranoid, but Andy asked me if we could cut the cake already. I put my best face on and went for it. The cake was in a box, and when Andy opened the box. He starts crying. I take a look and it's ruined. Bob was covered in all of it, appearing he had been eating the cake. Half of the cake wasn't there anymore. Miles starts laughing and so did some of the other parents. My blood is boiling and i grab Bob and throw it in the trash, Then i grabbed Miles. We have a terrible argument, calls me an AH for what i did to Bob, that I've ruined it, how are we supposed to keep the magic with our kids if i wasn't supposed to touch Bob. Edit: Hi everyone, so the response has been really overwhelming. I'm sorry if it took me some time to answer i was kinda avoiding the post, since i was conflicted by the possible outcome. I'm going through all your comments, so i can answer some of your questions. I'd also explain things you all have doubts in common. 1.-Andy's dad is from Canada, he visit's Andy every spring, summer and on Christmas break. This year he stayed for his job, so he isn't an absent parent. 2.-After Andy's bd i told Miles to get out of the house, and so he did, he spent Christmas with my in laws. I stayed with the kids, and all of them slept in Andy's room. My kids didn't want to leave his brother alone. The next morning we opened the gifts and i made sure that Andy could feel special after what happened on his bd, so i wrote a note from Bob. Saying that he is sorry if scared him and his siblings, he didn't do his job correctly so now he would be flying to the NP with Santa. And when he asked if Santa still remembered the kid of Xmas, he did. Santa was really happy to see him. 3.-My kids and i, are ok, we are sleeping at my parent's house. And we would celebrate NYE here too. 4.-Yes, Claire was usign the onesie while she was sleeping. My husband took the idea out of Tik Tok. And no, Andy, did nothing to even be attacked by Bob.",

        "selftext": "I moved from Georgia to the Pacific Northwest last year for a dream job after I graduated college. It was a little bit of a culture shock, because I went from being one of many black people around at any given time to often being the only non-white person in a room, let alone black person. There hasn't been a lot of overt racism, but there's been a lot of strange borderline situations that are amusing and race-related but not necessarily racist. For example, every white woman I meet mentions Beyonce to me within the first five minutes. When I was sitting for my driver's license photo the woman taking my picture opened with, 'So... Beyonce.' So the problem in the post title is that I am the only black woman at my office, and I am constantly, constantly being called the wrong name at work, and I'm coming up on my one-year anniversary. My name is Tina, short for Christina. Pronounced just like it looks, very easy name. For some reason, a handful of people at work call me Tiana, Tiara, or Tia, I think assuming that my name has to be more 'black sounding' than it is. I am most often called Tiana, especially by one of the guys on our development team and by the 'big boss' for another team, which I think then confuses their team members back into calling me the wrong name again. The other thing is that apparently another black woman (elderly, not in the same position I'm in) used to work there and I get called her name (Mary) sometimes too. Sometimes people will look at my name plate and ask me, How do you pronounce that? It's Tina! I have tried politely correcting this and I correct it immediately every time. From polite, Just for the record, my name is Tina! to lighthearted, Tina, like Tina Belcher! In e-mails from me that say Tina in a million places, including my e-mail address, I still get, Thanks Tiana! Sooo... I'm considering doing the Twitter approach, where I just respond to coworkers who call me the wrong name with the wrong name. Like: Chuck: Thanks, Tiana Tina: No problem, Chad! Jessica: Hi Tiara! Tina: Good morning, Jennifer! Would I be the asshole if I did this? I know it's passive aggressive, but every form of polite correction hasn't worked, and I feel really disrespected by this, so I may as well have some fun with it. EDIT: I am pretty overwhelmed by the responses so I just want to add a couple of things: A lot of people have suggested that I gently and firmly remind people of my name. That's what I've been doing, and was my first line of defense! A lot of people have suggested I go to HR. This is the kind of nebulous thing HR doesn't really help with, and it isn't as serious as it could be. A lot of people who identify themselves as white have informed me that this isn't race-related. It is. I have been black for 25 years, and I have a lot of firsthand experience with racism, and I can identify it in my own life. It isn't overt racism, like a slur or an assault, but it is still race-related. I feel like a few people are ALMOST getting it. A lot of people are referencing that Key and Peele sketch with the substitute teacher, which is literally a joke about how white people do this to black people, turned on its head! And finally, a few people have asked why I don't use Tina Turner as an example, since she's also a black Tina. First, I thought young-ish white people would be more familiar with Tina Belcher, but I used 'Tina Turner' as an example for our Dean and he then 'affectionately' nicknamed me Tina Turner, which took deprogramming from his EA to get over. EDIT #2: No, I don't have a southern accent. I'm from Atlanta, and black people from Atlanta don't really have an indecipherable country twang. Plus, my 'working in an office' voice is pretty practiced/neutral. More to the point, no accent makes the name 'Tina' sound like 'Tiana' or Tiara No, the people I work with aren't just 'idiots.' As annoying as this is, they are not stupid people. No, I can't wear a 'Hi, my name is' sticker or a nametag. We have a business professional dress code! Yes, I correct them every time. No, it's not because I'm not 'memorable' or a bad employee! Responding to this post saying, 'Okay Shaniqua' or some other racist caricature of a name truly misses the point, as this is already what my coworkers are doing ('Tiana' being the 'Shaniqua' in this instance). Several people have alarmingly said, 'Okay, Trayvon' and invoking the name of a dead black child at the idea of me calling a white guy 'Chad' is VERY WEIRD!",

        "selftext": "Heyo,I'm a schizophrenic.  Started when I was 22, and will last till I die. I'm active in schizophrenic communities, go to groups,  the works but I am fairly private about it to most people to include friends. It's fairly common for people to think I'm eccentric (comes with the turf) due to some of my habits. Those habits include not going to parties or other places with lots of people, suddenly deciding not to do something (I have to be protective not to do or go to certain things if I think a delusion might be coming on), saying the occasional odd quip, normal schizophrenic stuff. Some friends thought it would be funny to make it seem like  I might be going crazy as a group. They would individually wear something silly like a wizard hat or dinosaur costume (TRex blow up costume) to a group event or say something totally out of the ordinary and pretend like it was normal (Police like to track people like you, covid is just a way to microchip you, etc). These are very real scary thoughts to me. I would ask members of the group if they had heard concerns about these conspiracies or weird garb from the other members, but they all acted like they had hung out with that particular member that day and I hadn't been involved. I was really, really scared that this could have been a massive delusion morphing into a full psychosis so I preemptively checked myself into a hospital to stop myself from potentially hurting myself or diving further into the rabbit hole(common in schizophrenic community). I was so scared my medications stopped working. No one heard from me for a few days while I was in the hospital, and when I checked out I confided in one of them about what had happened. I got a really long apology explaining what had happened and I blew up at them.  I have ignored attempts from the others trying to apologize and have no desire to talk with them again. AITA for not previously stating that I am schizophrenic? Edit- People have been asking saying to post the length of the prank. Around 3 weeks. Edit 2- Thank you for the awards and stuff, but I really want to highlight some of the messages I have gotten. I'm at around 150 messages and counting and am trying to respond to the ones where I can hopefully offer insight. Resources that I find helpful- r/schizophrenia  For groups just google schizophrenia support groups in my area, something will pop up and when you actually get there someone will have a further list.  You get what you put into groups. You don't have to talk your first couple of times. But no one will look at you with the batshit look if you say Reality check- is there a bird in the room or something in that regard. That did happen once and the audible sigh of relief from 8 other people and the laughter that followed was hysterical.  Medication helps so much. It's the difference between being able to go for a walk with my dog and staying in bed all day. But it takes time. So many people have asked what drug and dosage a loved on should go on. I cannot answer that. There are so many drugs out there and different dosages. I can tell you that you (probably) will not have a noticable difference in behavior in two weeks after trying a medication. You start small, and work your way up to a therapeutic effect (when it actually helps). It might take some time to actually get to feeling human again. Not every medication is meant for every person, but don't give up!",

        "selftext": "I (35M) am a single father of 3 boys (10M, 7M and 3M). Their mother died last year due to ovarian cancer. It has been a rough year to say the least. My sister got divorced 6 months ago and temporarily moved in with me and the boys. She has a son, my nephew (9M) who stays with us most of the time. My nephew and my 10yro are not the best of friends, but so far they got along fine apart from some teasing from both sides. A few weeks ago my 10yro started telling me that his cousin was bullying him and being mean to him. He called him names, pushed him around, took his video games etc. I talked to my sister many times and told her to talk to her son, we talked to the boys together and things settled down. Yesterday was my 3yro's birthday, so my whole family was here and my late wife's family as well. It was extremely emotional for everyone, because it was the first birthday since my wife's been gone. The boys (10yro and 9yro) started fighting again and I asked them both to calm down and behave. My son started crying and told me his cousin teased him about him not having a mom. I choked up and asked my nephew if that was true, and he said yes, but that he's sorry. I figured I'd have a proper talk with him and my sister after the party, so I just told him what he said was really awful and he cannot say it again. I comforted my son and we went back to the party. Before we cut the cake, my sister came yelling at me, saying I had no bussineaa disciplining her child. I told her to drop it and we'll talk later, instead she said besides, he's right, kids need a mom. I had tears in my eyes by that time and she just said see, it's even turning you into a pu**y. My in-laws were crying, I was tearing up, the kids were upset, just awful. I told her to stop it and just leave me and the kids and the family to cut the cake and we will talk in the evening. She said listen we both lost our spouses, but at least I'm still a normal person. She stormed off. After the party I told her she has 2 days to pack her shit and leave. She is begging me not to throw her out, because she and her kid will be homeless. Aita for throwing her out? UPDATE: my mom agreed to take my sister in temporarily, and my nephew is still going to his dad's because now his dad is saying that there's no way he's letting my sister ruin their kid. I want to thank you all for your kind words and all the love and support. Also, to everyone who also shared about losing a loved one, I am so so sorry for your loss. My nephew is supposed to leave tomorrow morning, my mom is picking my sister up right around that time, and my inlaws are bringing my boys back in the evening. We'll have a little post-birhday thing for my little one when they come, just me, the boys and my inlaws. Just some ice cream (he said he prefers it over cake) and a few cartoons. One day at a time.",

For the last two years my brother and his fiance Sarah (32f) have been planning their wedding. And it's coming up in September. I was asked to be a bridesmaid. I figured i was only asked as a courtesy since I'm her soon to be sister in law but I still took it seriously. I have been a bridesmaid for the last two years. Just a few weeks ago I managed to save up to buy the 800 dollar bridesmaid dress. Over all in the last two years between group outings to parties, dinners,  lunches, clothes, etc\u2026 I spent thousands of dollars. Eventually all the girls in the wedding and I became extremely close and I started to get hyped for the wedding.  Sarah recently got close with her brother's wife Becky (30f). Last week she dropped the ball on me that she no longer wants me to be a bridesmaid and she would prefer if Becky would take my place.  It broke my heart a little but it's her wedding and it's not my place to tell her how to run it so I said it was fine. Yesterday I went to my brother's house to pick up the bridesmaid's dress, and was going to see if I could return it since it was within the time frame.  Sarah was completely appalled and said that Becky was going to wear it since she and I are the same size.  I said that would be fine, but they would have to pay me the 800 for it. Sarah said that Becky couldn't afford and I should just be nice and let her use it and said that I could keep it after the wedding.  I explained that I'm not just giving away the dress, and I'm not ever going to usei after the wedding. After some bickering back and forth I just ended up taking it and leaving.   My brother and Sarah tried to compromise with me, and say I could be the assistant flower girl and I felt offended at the offer. After I said no, they then said that Becky could give me 250 bucks for it. Again no and I returned the dress and got a full refund.   I told them I understand that it's their wedding but they are being extremely disrespectful to me and I don't need to deal with it and I'm not going to the wedding. Today my coworker says she has an extra round trip plane ticket to go to Miami that she'll sell to me for half price plus I would have to pay for half the hotel and I can go hang out with her in Florida. The only downside is that I'll be in Florida for the week of my brother's wedding.  So will I be the asshole if I just go party in miami instead of going to my brother's wedding?",

        "selftext": "My husband and I have been married for 6 years. Still don't have kids (we want them but it still not happening). Friends and family are causing us constant stress about having a baby soon but it's obviously something we can't control. We only wished that they'd stop but to no avail. So what I did was come up with idea (stupid I know) and that is have an empty jar and call it Pregnancy Jar. I carry it with me in my bag whenever I'm with friends and family and everytime someone asks about when my husband and I are gonna have a baby, I pull my Jar out and ask them to drop a dollar in there for asking. I'd get puzzled looks but they reach out for their pockets/wallets/purses and pull out a dollar and out it inside the jar. It actually worked because most of thrm stopped asking after 4 months. Last week we had dinner at my parents house, My brother came back from his business trip that lasted a month and while we were eating he asked when me and my husband were going to have a kid. My husband paused, I got up from the chair and made my way to where my brother was sitting with my jar in my hand and asked him to drop a dollar for the question he asked, he stared at me then laughed nervously asking if I was being serious.  Everyone was looking at us. He said no, he didn't have to pay me but I told him he didn't have to ask either so here we are!. I could tell he felt embarrassed he immediately reached out to his pocket, pulled out his wallet and put a dollar in my jar. I made my way back to my seat and sat down and resumed eating like nothing happened. It got awkward afterward. Mom pulled me into the kitchen later to tell me that I embarrassed my brother infront of his wife and family and said I should quit acting childish by running around with a jar demanding others to put money in it, I told her they should quit asking then. She went on about how they're just worried for us since we are in mid 30s and don't have much time left if we want at least one healthy baby. I got upset and she started arguing. My husband and I left and we haven't seen them in days, except I got a call from my sister basically siding with mom and the others saying I'm being childish. So AITA for this?  [Edit - Q&As... ] (1) this has been going on for years but in the past year it has gotten worse.  (2) I already told them about how I feel regarding this question, my husband doesn't care much and says I should let it go too. (3) Yes they pay everytime because it's just a dollar, it won't make me any richer or them any poorer. (4) My husband and I spend the money on snacks to eat every night when watching tv or some toys for the dogs. One more thing... I realize that this could actually be expanded into wedding jar/Cake jar (for weight loss)/work jar/house jar/ and so no and so on. Depending on the the type of truggle because these are the things we struggle and get frustrated with often but.. with the fact that people will just keep asking then we might become millionaires one day. Lol. Also, someone suggested I up the price to 5$. It will mostly depend on the prices of gas, lol, so we'll see.",

        "selftext": "I have a younger sister who looks exactly like me. I am 19 and she is 16, but people have been mistakening us as twins for some time because of how close we resemble each other. We have same height, same skin tone, similar voice even.  She also has a habit of being a copycat, from way of dressing to hobbies, even piercings. I know, its cute if you look it from the outside, sisters dressing and looking so alike that they are spitting images of each other. Honestly though, it's annoying and creeps me out sometimes, like yeah, we are quite close too but why does she always happen to pick up everything I pick up?? I have been asking her to stop that, but she always insist that she really just finds it suiting her liking that she just had to try it herself by getting similar, if not identical things that I have. One afternoon I was tidying up some costumes in my college showroom and found a rather cute brown and pink wig, looks like mushroom. I put it on, think it looks rather funny so I snapped a picture of it and posted in my Instagram.  I received a text from my sister asking if I really cut my hair(I did not mention it was a wig). The AH part is - while I somewhat have a feeling that she MIGHT copy that too, I lied and replied yes, I want a change of style. I went home when weekends came and lo and behold - my sister emerged with the same silly brown and pink bob cut, except this one is her permanent hair.  She was very surprised that I arrived with my hair still long, then realized that I lied to her. She was furious that she had to cut that silly hairstyle because she thought I had it, but truth be told, I never asked her to. She should have seen it in my picture that that hairstyle look super silly and yet she still tried to cut her hair that way. Our parents think that it was a really bad joke and wanted me to cut my hair too to make it up to her(I wonder why did they not stop her in the first place). While I feel sorry for her, I am somewhat glad that at least she won't be able to copy my hairstyle now with her hair so short so I am keeping my hair long.",

        "selftext": "My (31M) sister Anne (34F) got married on Saturday. My husband of 7 years, Mark (32M), was there with me and up until one point, is was an amazing evening. After the ceremony, Anne wanted a picture with all of our siblings (there\u2019s five of us) and their respective partners so we started lining up. When Anne saw that my husband was standing next to me, she shook her head and said something about him ruining the aesthetic.Apparently, her plan was to put one man and one woman next to each other alternately.  My youngest sister (18F), who doesn\u2019t have a partner and was standing on the very side, offered to stand between the two of us, so we could be close and Anne\u2019s wish would still be respected. I thought that was a great solution, but Anne disagreed and told Mark to get out of the picture.He\u2019s quite introverted and tries to avoid confrontation under all circumstances, so he simply complied and told me not to get angry, but it was obvious that he was hurt and disappointed by being left out. Obviously, it didn\u2019t stop me from getting angry and I walked away with him. I can understand that Anne wants her wedding pictures to look exactly how she imagined them, but I think that the idea my younger sister proposed was very reasonable. I congratulated Anne and her husband one last time, but then I said my goodbyes. When I was asked why we were leaving early (especially before taking the pictures), I said that I didn\u2019t feel like our presence was wanted. We left before dinner was served and I took Mark out to his favorite restaurant to cheer him up a little. Anne has texted me since saying that I was being overdramatic and making a fuss over nothing. Our parents have tried to remain neutral, but expect for my youngest sister, the rest of the family supports Anne and thinks that leaving early was going too far and that I should\u2019ve sucked it up instead of ruining her big day. EDIT: typos EDIT 2 because there was some confusion: My husband is able bodied and white (so is most of my family), but we are indeed a gay couple.",

        "selftext": "To start, my ex and I were 19 when she got pregnant. We had recently broke up and she found out a couple weeks later that she was pregnant. She said she planned to get an abortion but only wanted her sister there. So I was always under the belief that she had aborted. She only contacted me once saying it was done and we didn\u2019t speak again.  Fast forward 19 yrs later, I found out a month ago that was a lie. My ex passed away 3 years ago and my daughter Kara has been living with her uncle.  He was the one to reach out to give me a heads up after she expressed an interest in wanting us to connect. He and I spoke at length because I was feeling some pretty strong emotions like rage for never being told about her.  My ex had backed out of the abortion but didn\u2019t want me involved because we were broken up so decided just not to tell me. But he told me that Kara doesn\u2019t know about that. Apparently I wasn\u2019t ready for fatherhood because we were both young so I bailed.  I couldn\u2019t believe it. Rob (her uncle) told me he knows his sister was wrong for that but promised Kara doesn\u2019t have any negative feelings towards me and my ex never painted me as some villain, just a young guy who knew he couldn\u2019t properly care for her.  He asked me not to tell Kara this when we talk if she asks and because it could hurt the way she saw her mom. I never actually confirmed I would. Kara messaged me and we\u2019ve been talking. I\u2019ve met her twice and it\u2019s been crazy emotional. Looking at this girl who looks just like me and hurting that we\u2019re just barely getting to know each other So far our conversations have only been about what her life was like, how my life is, what her wants/future goals are, and getting to know each other. We met again Tuesday and she finally decided to ask the obvious questions about what made me not be involved. How did I feel, what went through my mind, did I ever think about her,etc. I had been thinking about what to do but in that moment I just didn\u2019t have it in me to lie so I was honest. That I was told about the abortion, had no idea she even existed until now, but that I still really want to be in her life and have the chance to be her father if she wants that. Kara was a bit emotional, we talked some more, and said she still wants me involved. That night my messages were blowing up. Not just from rob but her grandparents as well. They\u2019re all outraged for telling Kara about her mom because she yelled at all of them and is refusing to even take their calls.  Yes, the lie was terrible but I just ruined the image she had of her late mother for my own benefit. Rob called me a selfish dick for not taking into consideration how this would affect Kara finding out about this. So right now I feel like shit. I get \u201chonesty is the best policy\u201d but in this case I don\u2019t know if I was an asshole for doing it. I\u2019m still learning this whole \u201cdad\u201d business so don\u2019t know if I dropped the ball here.",

Me and my sister (37f)are  not as close as we used to be because of some messed up stuff that happened years ago. I had my son Jesse (9) pretty young. Months after that to my surprise my ex was pregnant again. Only I knew it wasn\u2019t me because having an infant to take care of and provide for left me with zero interest in sex. And we found out it was my sister\u2019s fianc\u00e9 -ex now -that she was seeing behind our backs. It hurt. Worst pain ever but for my son\u2019s sake I tried to get past it. I come from a family of half sibs too so I wanted my son to be close to his half brother (Keith).  Surprise, not only were they (my ex and my sister\u2019s ex) horrible lying cheaters, but also terrible parents. Both got hooked on drugs, only escalated from there. He got locked up when Keith was 3. This particular issue with my sister happened a couple years ago: My ex got sick, she was scared of Keith ending up in foster care like her and I didn\u2019t want that for him either. I legally adopted him before she passed when he was 6. Not everyone in my family was on board at first but he\u2019s the kind of kid that is hard *not* to love so they warmed up to him. My sister never did. She hated that I brought the son of her ex fianc\u00e9 into my family. And I understood why it was painful but Keith\u2019s and Jesse\u2019s best interest were my main priority. That\u2019s how we drifted apart. Last weekend was my birthday and had a small barbecue at my place. My parents have tried hard to mend things between us so they convinced me to let her come too so we can chat. I thought that meant she was cool with Keith because obviously the 3 of us are a package deal.  I asked my parents how would she feel about Keith, they said not to worry about it. Again I took it as she came around. Only she wasn\u2019t told he would also be present. But how could he not be? He lives there. My sister got there and she was mad when she saw him . She very specifically said \u201cI thought this was family only what\u2019s he doing here.\u201d Loud enough where he could\u2019ve easily heard but thankfully he was playing with his brother.  My sister was pissed because my parents told her Keith wouldn\u2019t be around. And I got pissed when she told me she didn\u2019t want him here expecting me to do something about it. So I just told her to leave, and she\u2019s not welcome here then. There was some back and forth from her and my parents. I didn\u2019t want that kind of talk around my sons so still made her leave. My mom seems to think I was a huge asshole for kicking her out of my party instead of trying to work things out.  Like they take Keith somewhere out of site while me and her talk. But to me, what\u2019s the point of us working it out if that\u2019s how she still feels toward my son? Well this is still causing some conflict since I \u201cescalated\u201d the feud by making her leave instead of actually talking to her . AITA?",

I live in Florida so I usually wear leggings and a sports bra or a tank top. I literally only wear it because it's insanely hot here. This woman always gave me dirty looks when I'd walk by her apartment (she'd be sitting on her porch.) There are a few maintenance guys (not sure if that is the correct title for them - but that is what everyone calls them) that walk and ride around on golf carts throughout the day. I soon realized that the dirty look woman is married to one of the maintenance workers. I am always polite to them, but have never talked to them by any means. So, yesterday I was working out on the tennis court which is near their apartment. Her and her husband were sitting on the porch. She is giving me the dirtiest looks and is making me pretty uncomfortable but I try to ignore it. Before I leave she says, Do you like get off on having the maintenance men check you out all day? To which I replied, Actually yes it makes me super wet. They are what keeps my sex drive high. She looked shocked and her husband started laughing and then she smacked him on the arm.  I came back and told my mom this story and she said I should be more sensitive and obviously the woman is insecure. Now I kinda feel bad. AITA?",

        "selftext": "So pretty much the title, I don't think I am the A but I've been getting some flack for it so I really want to clear this up. So I started a new job recently I work in small studio, there are several others in the building, think open plan office with sections assigned to each studio. The person I had an altercation with doesn't work for my studio just FYI.  I eat lunch at 1ish and most people eat at 12. I came down ealry to eat at 12, I made coffee and while at the counter noticed my tuppaware in the sink, empty.  Imagine my surprise when I turned around and saw a man I didn't know sitting down at the table with my food on his plate. He had just stuck it in the microwave. Acting rashly since I was mad, I sat down next to him and said 'hey that looks good, mind if I try it?' Then before waiting for an answer I yanked the plate away from him and snatched his fork out his hand, he just blinked in shock as did the other people there as I started eating. He then, quite loudly, asked what I thought I was doing and I replied 'huh you know this was actually much better when I first cooked it, it probably lost some flavor in the fridge.' he caught on quickly that it was it was my food and went a lil red. I then asked him where he got the gall to steal someone else's lunch and then ask them what they were doing when they took it back. He stuttered out some nonsense about not knowing it was mine and I replied well you knew it wasn't yours right? He just mumbled something like an apology and I said that's no problem it was nice he'd warmed it up for me at least, in an admittedly b*tchy tone, and then he just got up and left and the people there just stared in silence. 2 of the silent watchers, maybe his mates idk, told me that I was rude to him and that there had been nicer ways to go about it. I told them to think how they'd feel if someone ate their food before saying they should focus on their lunch and I'll focus on mine. Well it's been a little awkward at lunch since and I have the impression a few people are talking shite about me at work now, maybe I could've been nicer sure. I still don't think I was wrong but tell me reddit AITA Tldr lunchthief tried to eat my food in front of me I took it back and embarrassed him in front of his colleagues. Edit: Okay this blew up, just wanted to drop an edit on here to say thank you so much for all the comments, support and awards it's great to know I wasn't completely overreacting. Maybe I shoudl chat tp some people and see if the food thief has struck before will update then if yall are interested.  Otherwise additional info, I saw some comments saying I should go to hr but my studio doesn't have hr and the perp doesn't work for the same place, we do have a defacto office manager but I don't want to take it any further since I'm still new here and on probation/think my reaction might have been enough.  Update: So not sure if anyone wanted an update but I finally found out from a a new friend at work that yes the lunch thief has struck before! Apparently everyone wrote their names on their lunch to combat this, and the thief then targeted unmarked lunch or lunch items, guess no one told me ha.  People apparently starting being petty and standoff-ish to the thief since and he blames me for that lol. Also according to my new friend most were actually very pleased that the thief was finally identified/dealt with. I was assured that besides the thief in question and his cronies no one thought I was being a b*tch. However, not knowing much about me, assumed I was a very serious or clique-y person from my reaction, which I mean fair, I dress very professionally when most of the office dresses quite casual which probably added to that (think high heels, blouse and skirt VS shorts, graphic tee and slops). I've started to come down to lunch earlier to chat to some people and the office seems to be warming up to me. So not a drama filled update but I'm very happy things turned out so well and my reputation with my colleagues is off to a good start, thanks again for all of the comments and support think this will be final edit slash update too, thanks reddit :)",

        "selftext": "I F(25) have been renting a house since I was 18 (7 years). When I moved in, the backyard was a large piece of dirt, no lawn or anything, just a decently big backyard with a fence all around. It was a cheap but not great house, but I signed because I wanted the backyard space.  Over the past few years I erected a small garden shed, greenhouse and pizza oven (transportables), planted lots of veggie gardens in big transportable garden beds, and put down some nice pavers, an aquaponics set up, and generally made the backyard a really green and beautiful place to be. It became the green oasis all my friends gathered at.  A few months ago, my landlords let me know they were planning to sell, and my final move out day was a week ago. When I left, I brought my garden with me to my new place - nothing in my last backyard was directly planed into the ground, and nothing permanent. I dismantled the sheds and greenhouse, loaded up all the pots and garden beds onto a truck and cleared the backyard in three days with lots of help.  My former landlords are furious over this, and demand that I return the backyard to the former state - apparently they\u2019d listed the house for sale with pictures of the backyard and potential buyers were walking away from the house when they saw the barren backyard. They\u2019re accusing me of stealing their plants, and wrecking the backyard. Legally I\u2019m fine - my contract said I could garden, and I have photos from the first real estate walkthrough before I moved in that show that the backyard was in the same state as I first found it (although with more fertile soil now probably). The same real estate agent signed off my final inspection, and I got my deposit back.  I\u2019ve received mixed responses though, because I saw the landlords taking pictures of my backyard before I left but didn\u2019t make the connection because imho when pictures of a house has furniture in it, you don\u2019t expect to also get free furniture. Some of my coworkers suggested that IATA because the house valuation certainly has fallen dramatically because I didn\u2019t tell them I was taking my garden with me, so they couldn\u2019t plan to landscape before lockdown hit. Tl;dr AITA for moving my garden that I build from my former rental house into my new house, upsetting my former landlords who didn\u2019t expect me to take it with me?",

        "selftext": "Over the weekend, I (23F) went to dinner with some of my dad\u2019s relatives who I don\u2019t see very often.  My dad has never gotten along with my uncle (his brother) and I haven\u2019t either. He\u2019s rude, condescending, and we don\u2019t agree with him on a lot of things.  Normally I just try to ignore him. However, at dinner, my uncle asked me about my car I had shown up in and my new job.  I started my job a little over a year ago after graduating college and I worked hard for it. I make a lot of money and I\u2019m proud of that. (Software engineer.) I recently bought myself my dream car I\u2019ve always wanted.  Uncle asked \u201cHow much are they paying you anyway?\u201d in a condescending tone, and I just point blank told him how much I make.  I guess I was supposed to laugh and say something like \u201cOh, enough\u201d but I told him the number.  He started going off on a rant about how no 23-year-old should make that much money and how stupid my company is for paying me that much.  I got pissed and said \u201cI deserve every penny I make. I work hard and most people can\u2019t do what I do.\u201d  Well, I guess this really made my uncle angry, because after dinner I received a text from my cousin saying I had been really rude at dinner and insulted my uncle\u2019s intelligence. My dad sided with me (since he hates my uncle anyway) but my sister agreed with my cousin and said I shouldn\u2019t have said how much money I make or talked to my uncle the way I did because it was impolite.  AITA? EDIT: Wow, I didn\u2019t expect for this to blow up! Thanks for the responses everyone. I feel justified in how I reacted now. For more info on my uncle - he\u2019s a retired airline pilot, so I don\u2019t think he\u2019s even jealous/bitter about how much I make, he\u2019s just a jerk.",

        "selftext": " I (F35) am infertile. My ex husband and I tried everything to have kids but it just never happened. He divorced me, went and married someone younger who was able to give him a kid and from what I gather, they're expecting a 2nd child together. It hurts like hell seeing someone else have what I couldn't. I get frustrated with myself sometimes and with family blaming me for basically everything. I turn to my friends for support, Especially Alessia, she's in the same infertility boat as me but she and her husband are currently trying IVF hoping it'd work. Alessia asked me for help to pay for her upcoming IVF cycle. I agreed to write her a check of $12,000, I really wanted to help her and the money came with no strings attached. I wrote the check and gave it to her last week. She was very appreciative of it. The very next day, I got a sudden message from a mutual friend Carol with a screenshot of the conversation she had with Alessia. Turns out she and Alessia were talking about the next IVF cycle, and Alessia said she hoped the cycle would work because she didn't wanna end up divorced, and having her husband go marry someone younger and have a baby with them and another one on the way! While she's alone and without a family at 35! (She's 32). I was stunned and...hurt, I knew she meant me here. But I did not confront her I simply contacted my bank and cancelled the check. In the evening, Alessia called to ask why I cancelled the check and I told her. She went batshit saying she didn't mean it that way and that she thought that this was somewhat an inside joke between desperate infertile women. She came over with her husband the next day begging I write another check but I refused. An argument ensued and her husband thought I wasn't being supportive of her like when she supported me throughtout my struggles. She left crying and we haven't talked since then. Her husband keeps reminding me (while repeatedly calling Carol a toxic snake) of the date of the next cycle saying they can't have it after I took the money that was supposed to pay for it back!. Some friends thinks I'm being oversensitive. Carol's on my side telling me to tell them to go to hell but I feel so bad about it. what I've done might just damage our 15 years of friendship. Maybe I shouldn't have cancelled it but I just felt so offended by what she said about me and how she basically mocked my unfortunate circumstances. so reddit, AITA? Hello again! And Wow thank you so so much for all this support and compassion that you've shown me. I could feel it through my screen (LOL \ud83d\ude05\ud83e\udd23) I have decided I'm going to put some distance between me andAlessia. Things have been rough lately and I think that distance is what I need right now especially for my mental health. After reading some comments here I now feel less heavy and more relieved. Doesn't change the fact that I'm still feel completely and utterly shocked by Alessia's behavior. It's a shame having to come to the realization that even those who are supportive of you the most, could cause as much harm. Oh and by the way, I sent Carol a link for this thread to see what her thoughts were and she just laughed. She was kind of angry I used her real name but relieved that I used a throwaway LOL.",

She doesn\u2019t live with me, she stays over really often tho, so she has the house keys. 2 days ago, she came over without warning me. Me and my brother were asleep on couch, he wasn\u2019t wearing a shirt because it was hot, and he was laying on top of me. She woke us up and made a scene in front of him. She said that our relationship was weird and disgusting and it\u2019s extremely concerning that he\u2019s so affectionate towards me. My brother was in tears and he even apologized to her. I brought him to his room and calmed him down.  I went back to living room, she was sitting on couch, watching tv and acting like nothing happened. I told her to get the fuck out. She got defensive again and said that she was just stating her opinion without hurting anyone. I grabbed her wrist and brought her to door. I didn\u2019t hurt her, she was following me, I didn\u2019t use any force. She left, she called me few times but I didn\u2019t answer. Update: thanks for all the comments.

        "selftext": "My brother lost his job along with all his savings several months ago, and soon after he asked me if it would be okay if he (28M) and his wife (30F) stayed with me until they could afford their own place again. I hesitated at first, considering I only have a 1 bedroom apartment, but according to them they had 'no other options' so of course I invited them over and bought a blow-up mattress for the living room. For the first month things were manageable, although admittedly cramped. Then my brother told me that sleeping on the mattress was giving him back pains, so he asked if he could buy a small double bed for the living room. The living room is by far the biggest room I have, so I told him that would be fine as long as there was still room for my couch/TV/bookshelves.  The living room is also connected to my kitchen in an open plan style, so I reminded my brother to leave walking space around the bed. It's now been 2+ months and things have gotten a lot worse. When they first moved in, I would still use the living room every day to unwind on the couch after work. Now whenever I go in, there's a strange vibe like I'm intruding. My brother and his wife are often sitting in bed together when I go in (I always knock) and stare at me pointedly until I leave. Sometimes when I sit down they will directly ask me for some 'alone time' and say they would like the room to themselves. This came to a head yesterday when my sister-in-law messaged me with a 'timetable' she'd made of when it would be 'a good time' for me to use the living room. The timetable basically says that they will allow me into the room for an hour each evening, plus 20 minutes around mealtimes. I basically shut her down instantly and told her there was no WAY I'd be following the timetable since in the end it's my apartment. She sent me back a HUGE message with a dozen paragraphs about how my constant presence was 'ruining' her marriage with my brother and they feel like they have no privacy.  I tried to talk this over with my brother that night, but when I got home neither my brother/SIL were talking to me, so he's clearly just as pissed. Today an Amazon parcel arrived for my brother with a lock for the living room door, which I told him there's 'absolutely no way' I will allow him to install. My brother says I'm 'creepy' for wanting constant access to where they sleep and he's insisting on installing the lock anyway. AITA for not giving my brother and his wife their privacy?",

Now that he knows I have seen him in his true form he doesn't even try to act the way he did before. I sent his gf screenshots of the texts he's sent and told her the things he's said. I'm not sure if she is leaving or staying but I've let her know and told her to let me know if she needs any help. I don't plan on moving any time soon as I enjoy having room for a grill and smoker and a garage. He told me he's looking for new places to live and will potentially go back to his parents. I make enough working at a restaurant to afford the rent alone. I would like more going into savings but I'm not worried financially for the time being.\r  \r  \r  \r  \r  \r  \r  \r  I am flattered and overwhelmed by all the positive replies. Bout a hundred of you told me to thank my mom so I sure will. I grew up working in hospitality with my mom and siblings. My dad is the one that instilled respect into me. He never felt emasculated even when my mom's business ended up making more than he does. They just save their money from their jobs and go on vacation a lot. Thank you for all the kindness and offers for adoption/jobs/relationships/friendships lol. A lot of people wanting gumbo & chicken recipes. Too much to type out but I use curry powder in a lot of things to give it some good flavor(that's how my mom does it). White pepper is essential for that good good fried chicken flavor     (original post) I(21m) am from the south. I grew up in New Orleans and Texas. My mom runs a catering business and the majority of clients were either at home in Louisiana or in Texas. I add this to say that I grew up cooking and helping my mom cook for the business. I was frying chicken and catfish when I could reach the stove and making gumbo and buttermilk biscuits at a very young. I'm currently in culinary school right now.   I've lived in a rented house on the east coast with my roommate(22m) for a year and a half. He's not a friend or anything. We just linked up because we both needed roommates in the area. He's good to live with and we watch shows and movies together. We hang out and go out for drinks sometimes. I always make friends easy because of being from the south and doing customer service related things since I was a kid. I know how to talk and charm and listen to folk despite being naturally more in the introverted spectrum. My roommate has been seeing his girlfriend(20m) for like 6 months. I've met her before and seen her in passing. Roommate and his gf had a 2 week break from school things. She still lives at her parents so she decided to stay here the whole two weeks.  I was just doing things as I would normally do. It got weird at first when I was about to go mow the lawn and the roommate stopped me and said he wanted to mow(I usually always mow.) A couple of days later I was outside washing my car. I asked both of them if they wanted me to do theirs. She looked like she was going to agree but he looked at her angrily so they declined.   I cook pretty frequently at home as well and usually let my roommate have some. So any time I'd make some I would say that they could have some and this would get him pissed. Weeks prior when she was here and we were all talking. She mentioned this specific kind of cheesecake that she really likes. So I made and sent out a group text that everyone could have it. My roommate got upset. I don't see anything as overstepping a boundary as this is how I treat him and all guests. The other day he told me how annoying it was to hear his gf talk about how good your roommate can fresh baked bread is. I'm not trying to make him look bad or anything. This is simply how i was raised. If I bake two loaves of bread I'm gonna leave it out for the house to eat.  EDIT- The cheesecake is just common courtesy type thing to me. When his parents come over i make pound cake because they like it. If a guest is coming you get/make what they like. Nothing odd about picking up their favorite chips or making some tea when guests arrive. Just how I was raised  EDIT- Wow this has blown up. Just want to say we generally have a good roommate relationship. We're not best friends but it's friendly enough. The only change has been when his gf is here. So lol no I am not looking to for new roommates/to be adopted/or to move but thanks. Here is some more things that upset him.  I went to the grocery store and asked if anyone needed anything  I was frying chicken and offered the first/best pieces out the oil to them  I changed the oil to my own car  I used a smoker in the backyard to make brisket  I grill and smoke in the backyard and needed a piece of wood cut into a certain way to hold something up. I cut and nailed some wood together in the garage.  Feels like I can't even exist while she is here  FINAL EDIT- I tend to see the good and best in people. So I was not seeing him as being very insecure and was trying to look at this in a more positive light. But he just texted me and said that I  greet his gf in too kind of a way and it's annoying that I say be safe when she leaves the house(I say this to him and everyone when they they tell me they are going somewhere). He sent me a long text detailing it's bad that I look her in the eyes when she is talking to me??? Maybe it is time for a new roommate  ",

        "selftext": "To start, my fiance is willing and happy to take my last name-- he grew up with a horrible father. He has no attachment to his last name and no siblings. I have a very unique last name and a strong attachment to it.  I brought this up to my father and he said wasn't so sure about it, given my brother is the only male in the family who would carry on the name. My brother found out before I could bring it up to him and called me, saying I was being inconsiderate and couldn't believe he hadn't been asked. This got me irritated, because in my opinion, I have just a right to share my name as he did with his wife. He and his wife have been married for over a year and I think they feel possessive about the fact they were the only ones supposed to carry on our name. I think the fact that this is an issue at all is rather sexist. It's my last name too and if I want to give my future husband--who has never had the privilege of feeling like he belongs to a family-- my name, no one should take issue. I have three sisters who aren't yet married, but they shouldn't have to feel bad about giving their name either. I don't feel like I'm being selfish here, but AITA for breaking tradition? *UPDATE*  Did not expect this to blow up! My father and brother are amazing people and husbands\u2014I think they were caught off guard by my thinking more than anything else. I\u2019ve let it go for now, but will bring it up again simply to explain my thinking and I believe they will understand. They are rational, empathetic human beings, if a little old school sometimes :)  As for my fianc\u00e9\u2014 he is absolutely amazing and all my family approves . When I originally brought up keeping my last name, he was the one who suggested taking mine as well. He\u2019s perfectly secure in his masculinity for all those wondering lmao. Thank you for all the encouragement! My fianc\u00e9 and I will be rocking our kickass last name soon enough.",

        "selftext": "Throwaway account  I (24f) gave birth to my daughter six months ago and it should've been the happiest moment in my life. When my daughter was born her skin was very dark and looked like she could have two biological parents who were of African descendent. My husband Jim (26m), fake name, was furious and accused me of cheating and left right then and there. He told everyone on both sides of the family what happened, made posts on social media and wanted a divorce. His family and a lot of our friend all called to say how upset they were at me and called me really nasty names. My mother was by my side the entire time and I kept professing my innocence. Jim refused to pick me up from the hospital, threw my stuff out on the lawn and changed the locks, so I had to stay with my parents. When my sister called to ask for the baby stuff Jim texted me pictures of the bare nursery room and said he got rid of everything. He even destroyed my Art studio, I like to paint, and the art I made and told me my work would be too awful to sell. I was distraught and tried to focus on my baby. Weeks went by and Jim refused to speak to me directly and has never once asked about our child. Eventually he agreed to do a paternity and he was 100% the father. No one could believe the results and it was done again, Jim's the dad. Around that same time one of Jim's cousins did the Ancestry thing and there was around 30% of African ancestry in the family. This combined with the test Jim paternal great-grandmother admitted to having an affair around the time Jim's grandfather was born and was because he could pass she just assumed her husband was the father. Since then Jim has been reaching out and everyone has come to apologize, and while it did feel good to feel vindicated the damage has been done. I can't un-hear or unsee all the horrible things that was said and done. Not just to me but to my child as well. Jim made some very racist remarks. Things that I thought he'd never say and he did it so easily. Regardless of what our daughter looks like I don't want her to be around that. What else will Jim and his family say or do the next time they get mad? How are they going to treat our daughter when she does something that upsets them? Jim has been begging for forgiveness. I said I needed time, he asked to see the baby and I let him but I'm too afraid to physically hand her to him. He's repairing the the nursery and keeps asking me what I would like and I cry every time saying we already had what I liked and some of the items that we had can't be replaced. He asked me if I still loved him and I admitted that he showed me his worst self and I don't know if I could live with that image. I didn't mean to be hurtful but it's how I feel. My sister suggested Couple's Therapy but I don't feel like I should have to work to fix something that I didn't break. I've never cheated and have been 100% innocent in all of this the whole. AITA for not wanting to give Jim a second chance? Update 1: I stepped away for a few hours and couldn't believe what I came back to. I am truly amazed by all the wonderful comments of support as well as the private messages. I also understand why some people may think this is fake and all I can say is that you are free to believe what you want in this. I also see some questions and I think I should clarify a few things just in case your judgement may change. 1. All of this initially happened at the near February and I was already settled at my parents' house before the pandemic hit.2. One of the reasons Jim wouldn't pick me up from the hospital was because I wouldn't admit to cheating or give him any details, because there weren't any which made him angrier.3. Based on the pictures Jim sent me he didn't take a sledgehammer to the crib or anything. He just took stuff down to either return it for the money or gave it away. While deeply hurtful I wouldn't call it violent, but maybe it is.4. Online he announced that I pushed out a dark skinned baby and was going to he was divorce me. His family started with the racial comments and eventually he started doing it too but only through my family, he refused to speak to me directly.5. Once the truth came out everything he and his family posts were all taken down but I, and a few friends, still have the screenshots. Jim never wrote down his racial remarks.6. While he didn't say any of the racist words he did make comments about our daughter being a Welfare Princess, and how I was going to be just another baby mama.7. Just to clarify. Jim is white and I am at least half white. One of my parents is adopted and with everything that's happened they decided to do the Ancestry thing too and we should be getting the results any day now. Update 2: Spelling Errors   Update 3:    Mod denied separate post so it's here as an edit. Thank you so for all your words of encouragement a couple months back, both in posts and the DMs. A lot of things have happened since my initial post and I just needed time to process it and be in a place where I can write about on social media. So here it goes.... First, my parent who was adopted did the Ancestry/23 thing and it turns out that Jim wasn't the only one who had African ancestry. My parent had at least 45%, which means I have at least 20%. I am legally separated from my husband with primary custody, and I'm living with my parents until further notice. He still keeps apologizing and wants me to come back to the house, he even offered to leave so I could stay with our daughter but I don't want to and really like having the support of my parents. My dad is retired so he does a lot of the babysitting while my mother and I work remotely. I do go to the house every so often so Jim can see his daughter and for Couple's Counseling via telecom. In one of the sessions Jim confessed something really hurtful and some of you guessed right, he cheated. It was while we were dating, before he proposed, and his treatment towards me was a projection. It was with an ex-girlfriend who had cheated on him and he hooked up with her as an ego boost. He started to feel guilty but was too scared that I would walk away to ever confess. Jim also admitted that he was scared when I got pregnant (our baby wasn't planned), was very anxious about being a father, but just pretended to be excited because he didn't want to look like an A. My husband was so willing to believe that our daughter wasn't his because he thought he had an out. Now that he knows that our child is his and has spent time with her Jim regrets everything and just wants his family back and is willing to spend the rest of his life making it up to us. This was all deeply hurtful and I've cried about it more than once. Jim has been lying to me and my ability to trust him hasn't improved at all. When the holidays came around Jim's parents asked about seeing their grandchild and I didn't want to. They told me that it was selfish of me to keep her away and I reminded them of their past. They said that they've already apologized and tried to minimize the situation. They said that I can't be angry forever and that I need to learn to forgive them. I'm so ashamed of ever loving and marrying into this family and wonder why I didn't see this before. I've decided to contact a lawyer and will be filing for divorce after my daughter's first Birthday.",

        "selftext": "My daughter had a spelling test which included some holiday words for extra credit. One of the words was Chanukah. My daughter spelled it the way I just did, but the teacher marked it wrong and corrected it to Hanukkah. She said to my daughter you're Jewish and you don't know how to spell Hanukkah? I think she meant it jokingly but my daughter was annoyed. My daughter told the teacher that Chanukah is correct, but the teacher didn't believe her. I told the teacher that Chanukah was also correct and that my daughter should get the point, and the teacher argued with me, saying that Hanukkah is more correct because it's more commonly used than Chanukah. I said if any spelling is more correct it would be Chanukah because the Ch represents the sound from the back of the throat you're supposed to make. The teacher agreed to correct the test but seemed really sour about it and said she was just trying to be inclusive. I said I appreciate that but she should keep in mind that if the word isn't in English that there might be multiple acceptable spellings for it and that they should all be given credit. My husband says I overreacted. Honestly I probably wouldn't have bothered so much if the word was something else, but I resented the teacher, who isn't Jewish, arguing with me and my daughter about how to spell our own holiday.",

        "selftext": "This happened a few months ago, but my brain won't let this one go. So I was hanging out with some friends. Two guys, one woman. We're all in our early 20s and have had our fair share of romance in life. The topic of sex popped up and we start talking about some of our past experiences. One guy joked about how having sex only made his dick bigger and bigger. We all laughed and he said that he wished that's how it works. My female friend (let's call her Sarah) piped up and said Yeah, for women, it's the complete opposite. The more sex you have, the bigger your labia gets and the looser you become. There were some chuckles, but then I asked her if she was serious. She said she was. Now, this is a big myth. I was surprised a woman who has had some experience actually believes that. I basically told her this, and then she started getting annoyed, asking how me and my dick knows about that. I said the same way I know anything about female anatomy- I've read up on it. The whole women get looser thing is something sexist dudes made up to slut-shame women. My other friends were silent on this. She then just said: Whatever, I'm not in the mood for your mansplaining. So I'm at a loss here. AITA for explaining something that I feel like people should just know about?",
