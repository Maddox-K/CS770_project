        "selftext": "I (22f) have an older brother (John-32m) who has been with his fianc\u00e9 (Jane-30f) for 4 years. They have a 4 month old. Jane found out she was pregnant at 5 and a half weeks and immediately called my mum to tell her. Mum was confused, but still very excited. Jane said she was going to tell John when he got back from his work trip. A few hours later, she called again, sobbing, saying she has \u2018insatiable cravings\u2019. Mum made a joke like \u2018isn\u2019t it a bit early for cravings?\u2019 and Jane went OFF on her. She started yelling about how this was \u2018her pregnancy\u2019 and no one else\u2019s. It was an odd reaction. she also apologised for her outburst by blaming it on hormones. When my brother returned from his trip, him and Jane left to stay at her mother\u2019s and we didn\u2019t see her until after the baby was born. John said this was because Jane was afraid of losing the pregnancy and wanted to be with her mum and we needed to respect boundaries. Whenever someone would ask about Jane or the baby, they would shut it down with vague answers like \u2018Every pregnancy is different\u2019 or \u2018She\u2019s carrying small, which isn\u2019t unusual\u2019. They barely shared anything about the pregnancy. No ultrasound pictures, no baby shower, and Jane didn\u2019t want anyone around during the delivery. I also discovered that every craving she listed, came from one article about pregnancy cravings (she even listed multiple items in the same order as the article). When the baby was born, we were finally allowed to see Jane and John (and baby of course). It was very bittersweet as we all wished we could have been there for Jane to help out, but Jane and John both reassured us that we did help out by staying away during the pregnancy. The weirdest part though, is how Jane describes the birth. She claims she had an epidural via IV drip into her HAND (edited bc I didn't elaborate--)\u2026 which is NOT how those are administered. When I asked clarifying questions (thinking she had gotten confused, which is understandable) she shut down and refused to answer, like how she would during the pregnancy. She said the baby had 'latching issues' because he was born with no umbilical cord stump. This can technically happen, but it\u2019s a rare and fatal medical condition that their baby does not have. The final straw was when she told us that the baby \u2018basically fell out of her\u2019 within an hour of being in labour, despite my brother telling us how hard the birth was (and even stating that was why they weren\u2019t going to try for any more kids). Mum is on the same side as me, and has been noting this inconsistencies and inaccuracies but doesn\u2019t know how to bring it up. And their reactions don\u2019t help. A few days ago, my brother text mum saying her doubt of Jane is disrespectful and they both want full apologies from the both of us for 'bullying' Jane about her pregnancy/labour. I haven't made any outright accusations about it, nor have I said any of this to Jane. I've only asked questions when she brings the birth/pregnancy up. AITA for having doubts?",

        "selftext": "My niece Jay(10F) was the only Granddaughter when my mother died in 2020. When she died, she wanted my niece to have her porcelain doll collection which had around 6 dolls. These porcelain dolls were around when I was a child and I had memories of getting in trouble for playing with them. They were absolutely beautiful. Well, when my mother died I (29F) decided to keep ONE doll, I know it wasn\u2019t left to me, but I felt like they meant more to me than they could to my niece. I contemplated giving it back to her when she was old enough to appreciate it. We\u2019re from Louisiana and hurricane Laura hit \u2026 when we evacuated. I took the doll with me because I knew it was sentimental and irreplaceable. My niece, however let all of the remaining five dolls get ruined in hurricane because she let them in the house when where got ruined. My twin sister (Jays mom) thanks that it\u2019s only fair that I give Jay the doll. I kept safe because after all it was left for her\u2026. My argument is that if I would have gave her the doll, it would have gotten ruined with the other ones because she didn\u2019t care enough about them to take them her with her. Fast-forward, we are now in 2025 and I have a daughter of my own. I 100 % believe if my mom would have known she was gonna have another granddaughter she would have left a doll to her. AITA? ",

(He sometimes picks the bill up himself but more often it\u2019s the joint account that gets used).

I didn\u2019t say anything in front of the kids but when home I checked he\u2019d used the joint account, and when he confirmed he had I asked why he\u2019d not corrected the kids that it wasn\u2019t just him that had paid.  He went off at me for ruining a good night and that I was being picky about paying the bill, completely missing my point.  My point wasn\u2019t about money, it was about him taking the credit and not correcting the kids.  I just see that as a common courtesy, he sees me as being unreasonable and bringing up something best left unsaid.  So AITA here? Should I have just let it go?",

        "selftext": "My Maid of Honor (29F) found out she's pregnant and due in August. I (29F) live a plane ride away from her. We've been friends for 15 years.  Today my MOH mentioned planning a baby shower in a group chat with me and our other friend, we can call him Ben (29M).  She asked Ben, who is local to her, How can I make sure you can attend the baby shower? He has a demanding job. I have a salary job and it's easy to get time off.  MOH shared she wanted to have her baby shower on a specific long weekend between my wedding (In April) and her due date. I said I'm so sorry, that's [other friend, let's call her Sue]'s wedding. MOH said woof, well I think that's the only weekend I can do it. Not only is it Sue's wedding but I was also planning on going to an event in the wedding's area with another friend, Daisy, who was planning to fly there for the event. I have no other plans the remaining weekends. I said I'd really hate to have to be an asshole and cancel on two people, I'd really appreciate if you did not put me in that position. Perhaps my wording was disrespectful there. My MOH shared that she did not understand why I have an issue cancelling on Daisy, but Sue's wedding she can understand. I explained that if it came down to it, I would cancel both of them for her baby shower, but it just sucks to be in this position.  She made several comments such as my baby shower doesn't revolve around your schedule and Yeah I get being upset about cancelling things, I have to cancel and change things for the next 18 years. I chose to ignore these comments as she has shared she is hormonal and wants people to go easy on her. I asked her to speak to her husband's family about their schedule and let me know to try to de-escalate. She said she didn't understand why I was getting upset at her and I didn't understand where she was coming from. Where she is coming from is that she is guessing this weekend is the only weekend her husband's family is available, and the weather around that time would likely be ideal. That's when I snapped a bit and pointed out that I was ignoring her rude comments and just wanted to work with her because I love her but she doesn't seem to see that effort and asked her to stop attacking me.  From there we did manage to de-escalate, but I still feel hurt that she was not willing to reconsider her plans for me, but had no problem asking Ben about how to make sure he can come. I also feel upset that she doesn't find it significant that I am being expected to cancel plans with multiple people that involve travel. Her opinion is I should have little problem cancelling these other things for her baby shower. I love her, I will, but it still fucking sucks. AITA for telling my MOH to stop attacking me after I told her it'd suck to cancel two large life plans for her baby shower. EDIT: This baby shower is NOT scheduled or confirmed with any of her family. She was throwing out a possible weekend and I shared I was busy. To clarify, if this date was SET and she told me \u201cthis is when it is, it is scheduled\u201d I would not have given her any grief at all.  EDIT2: some commenters have expressed opinion changes with this detail. We have the kind of friendship where I am 100% expected to attend this baby shower, which she considers a major life event. I am wondering if I am the asshole for not wanting to cancel on my other commitments or if she is the asshole for expecting me to cancel these and not being very willing to choose a date I am free, despite completely expecting my presence.  UPDATE: I spoke with my MOH today and we have resolved this conflict. We had a communication breakdown. She does expect me to be there but understands I have commitments. She chose another weekend.

        "selftext": "I have two children: Donna (21F) and Austin (19M). Both live at home but also stay on campus at their respective colleges. Austin has a girlfriend, Bridget, whom he\u2019s been dating for nearly a year. Early in their relationship, Bridget stayed over once while Donna was at school. With Donna\u2019s blessing, Bridget slept in Donna\u2019s room, and Austin stayed in his own. They chose to sleep separately, and there was no drama. This winter break, both kids were home. Toward the end of break, Bridget returned from out of state but couldn\u2019t move back into her dorm yet. Austin asked if she could stay with us for a few days. I agreed but mentioned we\u2019d need to figure out sleeping arrangements since we don\u2019t have a guest room\u2014just mine and my husband\u2019s room, Austin\u2019s, and Donna\u2019s. Austin said he and Bridget now share a bed, but his twin bed would be a tight fit. Donna has a full-sized bed, so I suggested Donna and Austin switch rooms temporarily. Donna could use Austin\u2019s bed, and Austin and Bridget would stay in hers. I assured Donna I\u2019d change the bedding afterward, but she was visibly upset and asked why Austin couldn\u2019t just sleep on the couch. I told her it was only for a few days, and since Austin wanted to share a bed with Bridget, this arrangement made sense. When Bridget arrived, everything seemed fine at first. That night, Bridget went to bed early, and Donna pulled Austin aside in the kitchen. I couldn\u2019t hear the start of their conversation, but Austin suddenly started yelling, \u201cShut up! Why would you say that?\u201d before storming into the living room. He loudly announced he\u2019d never invite Bridget back if \u201ceverything\u2019s such a problem.\u201d When I asked what happened, Austin explained that Donna asked him not to have sex with Bridget in her bed. He claimed he had no intention of doing that and accused Donna of being weird and trying to cause trouble. Donna said she had purposely tried to talk to Austin quietly to avoid a scene and hadn\u2019t said anything to Bridget. She also said it wasn\u2019t unreasonable to ask, given she knew Austin and Bridget were sexually active. I told Donna she didn\u2019t need to make such a big deal since I\u2019d already promised to wash the sheets. Donna became upset and ended up staying with a friend for the rest of break. School has since resumed, but Donna is barely responding to my calls or texts. Austin told me Bridget overheard the argument and now feels uncomfortable being in our house or around Donna. My husband said Austin caused the scene by yelling and pointed out that Donna wasn\u2019t out of line for making her request. He also said I should never have let Bridget stay in the first place.AITA? ",

        "selftext": "Son's birthday today. He's 5 years old. I wasnt there this morning as stay away from home some nights due to work. Even if had slept at home would have left for work before the kids woke. We have a party planned on Saturday, and will be there at dinner time tonight. I realised that my wife gave my son a present this morning. She said it was from 'us. Apparently she does this every year. I was hurt, and told her so. I thought it was selfish that she couldn't wait to share his excitement.  Her excuse is that it is unfair on him to make him wait. find that ridiculous, and believe he absolutely could wait.  I said the only reason to give it early is the selfishness of wanting to experience his joy alone without sharing it. AITA?  Edit(s): This blew up quicker than I expected (I couldn't get online for the last hour). And overwhelmingly with YTA responses, many with some unfair assumptions so I want to add some context in my defence although I think it wont change the general outcome. 1. Today is his birthday, although we have other special plans. Next week I'm taking 3 days off work, two of which are for a family trip and the third is a special day for my son. I couldn't get today off work though, and Saturday is his proper party, which I obviously will be there. I have a 1.5 hour commute each way (hence why I don't normally see him in the morning before he gets up for school), but I normally read the bedtime story when I'm home and I video call EVERY evening that I'm not home. I'm not an absentee father, and I'm not just a sperm donor. 2. My wife has bought most of the presents but not all of them. We tend to put things in gift bags not wrap them. Last year it was me that bought the main present, this year there wasn't a main present, it was mostly a few smaller ones because the family trips mentioned in (1) are really his main present. I don't expect her to do all the gift shopping and give all the ideas, I do a share of it. She does have more free time than me, and does more of the childcare than me. That's a problem of our (shared) lifechoices and not something that we can easily change. My long commute is primarily due to decisions on her part. 3. Yes, she said she does this every year, but first and second birthday are not quite the same level of concious response, and 3rd and 4th I am not sure what she gave him in the morning. As I mentioned, last year I got the 'main' present, and that was given in the evening I am definitely jealous if she is giving him presents. I definitely want to be part of the enjoyment of his birthday.  I was hurt and didn't understand why he had to receive the present when I wasn't there. Yep he's 5 years old, and every family is different. I don't remember receiving presents until the whole family was there in the evening. I thought that was normal, and assumed my wife had the same thoughts. We hadn't discussed it, and I was upset for missing out.I think if I knew, then I wouldn't have reacted that way, but it was a shock and I was upset. I still am jealous and have some feelings to work through. I don't like my work situation and commute, but I really don't see a way to resolve it (without significant financial risk that I'm not willing to take in this climate) so will have to suck up my disappointment. I called my wife selfish for getting the joy, alone without discussing it first, or without giving me the chance to join on video call. I guess I need to take the YTA verdict. Edit(again):Too many comments to respond to, and can't respond for at least a few hours so that I can spend time with my son on his birthday!",

        "selftext": "I (35F) and my husband (33M) live together with our two children (3M & 1F).  Recently I have been under the weather with some low level cold & sore throat. I\u2019m feeling crappy but still able to do day to day stuff, I have been going to work, looking after the children etc as normal.  Today the children are due to be looked after by our childminders who live next door to us, we can drop them off anywhere between 8-9am. We get them up and dressed and feed them breakfast before they go and pack their bags with spare clothes, nappies, bottles for our daughter and food for both of them throughout the day.  Today I have a dentist appointment in the town over at 10am. My husband is due to attend a viewing of a primary school in the village next to us in the opposite direction at 9:20am with my mother who is making her own way there.  This morning I got up when my alarm went off with my son, got him dressed and gave him his breakfast, went back upstairs for our daughter, got her dressed and gave her her bottle then started making their lunches which included washing up as there were no clean bottles for her to take with her. My husband remained in bed until 8:50am then came downstairs and asked why I was stressed and grumpy. I told him that I\u2019d got up by myself with both children, needed to leave for my appointment in ten minutes and the kids bags still weren\u2019t packed and the car was frozen and I still wasn\u2019t dressed myself. He then asked what he could do to help and I asked him to defrost the car which he did.  When we had dropped the kids off at 9am I started getting myself dressed and he asked I was \u2018even going to have time\u2019 to take him to the primary school (we only have one car and only I have a drivers licence), I said no and was he expecting me to take him and he said yes because I had organised the trip to the primary school.  I pointed out that while I have organised for him to go to the primary school I am not actually going myself. Not only that I have plans, which he knows about, at the same time in a different location in the opposite direction. Also at no point has he asked me for a lift. He says I should have known he would be expecting a lift there as I planned the visit.  In addition to the above, if I was going to give him a lift we would have needed to leave earlier so I could drop him off and make my appoint on time but he didn\u2019t get up with me and get the children out of the house and everything ready so we could do this.  I left for my dentist appointment while he complained he was going to be late and started trying to book a taxi at around 9:10am.  So AITA for not giving my husband a lift to the school viewing?  For info - at 9:05 once we realised he was expecting a lift and I wasn\u2019t expecting to give him one if we had left immediately to drop him off I would probably have been about 5 minutes late to my appointment, maybe just made it if traffic was ok but the ground is frosty today so driving conditions weren\u2019t great.  For info #2 - also, for everyone in the comments who is at an absolute loss for how he was supposed to get himself there without a lift, The school is a ten minute drive from our house and taxis are very cheap where we live, it would have cost him approximately \u00a35 to get a cab there.  Update - ok ok I get it, I\u2019m TA for going to the dentist with a cold haha. Although yes I do take on board all the comments highlighting our issues with communication, going forward we\u2019re going to have a briefing for the next day where we\u2019re clear about who is getting up in the morning, what our plans are and how we\u2019re getting there. Also for those dragging my husband for being a third child, despite how he was acting yesterday he\u2019s usually a very involved partner and father who takes on many jobs around the household and does his fair share of parenting. He used to get up in the night with our daughter and I would do the early mornings which worked well for us however our daughter no longer really wakes up in the night and he has continues to have the lie ins so I think we just need to update our division of labour in that regard. Thanks to everyone who\u2019s posted measured and detailed responses, I\u2019ve found a lot of helpful advice. ",

        "selftext": "Hi AITA, I have a 5 year old cardigan corgi. He\u2019s an absolute unit, and as my friends say, he\u2019s high in strength/constitution and low in intelligence/wisdom. He often tries to eat things that aren\u2019t safe for him.  I live alone and hired a dog walker I found on Rover to visit him once a day during the work week. Instead of going through the app, I agreed to pay her in cash. She\u2019s generally been great. But, we\u2019ve had a few mishaps like her not telling me when my dog ate and tore up a wooden hand fan. I\u2019ve given her the benefit of the doubt because my dog loves her and enjoys his walks with her.  Last night, my dog vomited up five or so partially chewed, large, bright-orange seeds. They are from the coontie plant and are in the same family as sago palms, which can be fatally toxic to dogs even in small amounts. Unfortunately, they are part of the landscape in my \u201cdog-friendly\u201d apartment complex.  I decided not to wait it out and took my dog to the emergency vet. They admitted him to critical care because the risk of him deteriorating was so high, even though he was in good spirits when I left him.  I messaged my dog walker to let her know what happened, and she insists she never saw him eat the seeds and that she tries to prevent him from eating things on the ground. I know he did not eat the seeds on my watch, because I exclusively took him to the turf-only dog park yesterday, which isn\u2019t near the toxic plants.  This emergency vet visit is costing thousands of dollars. I haven\u2019t brought up the cost to her yet, but WIBTA to request that she contributes to this huge expense? I get it\u2019s my dog, but also I have never let this happen on my watch. I understand it was likely an honest mistake, but also I feel as though it\u2019s really irresponsible to let someone\u2019s dog eat random things off the ground, especially if you aren\u2019t paying close attention.  Edit \u2014 Thanks everyone for your feedback. I will absolutely accept that I would be TA if I asked my walker to contribute to my vet bills. I had several people in my life reach out and suggest I ask, hence this post.  I will not be asking her to pay. I will, however, invest in good pet insurance and will only pay dog walkers through Rover from now on.  I will clarify a few things for the sake of this post. - Yes, I pointed out the unsafe area. - Yes, she knows he will eat things off the ground, but she also knows he is trained and responsive to several commands including \u201cleave it\u201d, \u201cdrop it\u201d, and \u201cwait\u201d.  - This plant is only in specific parts of the complex, which are easily avoidable. - Yes, multiple sources have confirmed this was a life-threatening situation for my dog due to what was ingested.  Edit Part 2: Electric Boogaloo \u2014 Thank you AGAIN for everyone\u2019s feedback. My Hoover of a dog is doing okay, his labs look good and hopefully he\u2019s coming home soon.  A few more things I\u2019ll add: - I will absolutely be investing in a muzzle.- like some of you have suggested, it might be worthwhile to invest in a more vetted walker (instead of Rover)- I am very blessed, and my low rider Unit of a dog\u2019s bills are paid (yes, by some of the very people who asked whether I was going to ask my current walker for compensation)- I walked my apartment complex\u2019s property this morning. On the very far side of my building, there is a line of these palms that were apparently just trimmed, and there are huge piles of the seeds all lined up. Dog walker admitted to letting my Dyson Dog \u201csniff\u201d the seeds, so \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f- it\u2019s a moot point because there are lots of things I will do moving forward to prevent this from happening again (boy I\u2019m dense, I genuinely don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t think of a muzzle in the first place \u2014 I\u2019ve used things like grazing muzzles for my horses before). - Medical scares and renewed agency are one hell of a drug. - I do want to say, I\u2019ve truly been trying my best. I came here for feedback, and I got what I needed to move forward and keep my dumb dog safe. Reddit gives me tough love, and even when it stings, I\u2019m grateful. - I talked to the front office staff about the plants. If anything, maybe some signs can be posted. ",

        "selftext": "I (35M) have a friend, Steve (48), who accidentally got Stephanie (44) pregnant about a decade ago, and they now have a daughter, Chloe (9). I met Steve last year at a park while walking my dog, and we became friends since he lives nearby and also has a dog. Steve\u2019s a good guy who cares deeply about his daughters (he has three adult daughters from another relationship). Whenever I\u2019m with Steve and Stephanie calls, she often seems ridiculous. Sometimes she calls over minor things; other times, she\u2019s frantic, like she\u2019s on the verge of a breakdown. She\u2019s a helicopter parent and very possessive of Chloe. Stephanie doesn\u2019t let Chloe visit Steve alone. The first time Steve ever took Chloe anywhere without her was recently\u2014and only because one of his adult daughters went with them to a movie. Steve said Stephanie blew up Chloe's phone the entire time. Steve wanted to teach Chloe to ski, but Stephanie told him it wasn\u2019t appropriate for a 9-year-old and that he needed to find a better activity. Every idea Steve has for activities gets shut down with an excuse. Despite this, Stephanie often makes passive-aggressive comments like, \u201cCome over here and be a dad,\u201d even though Steve gives her at least $250 a month (voluntarily, no court order) and spends multiple evenings a week at her place to be with Chloe as that's Stephanie's idea of visitation. She makes it seem like he isn't a good father or something when it is\u00a0**she**\u00a0that doesn't really let Chloe hang out with friends,\u00a0**she**\u00a0that bought Chloe a smartphone due to her incessant need to always be able to contact her,\u00a0**she**\u00a0who isolates Chloe from Steve's side of the family and\u00a0**she**\u00a0who is always worrying about making rent, yet only has a part-time job and spends money that should be going towards other things on weed. When Steve brought up to Stephanie that he thought that 9 is way too young to have a smartphone, his concerns were all ignored. When he brought up that he doesn't like Chloe being around her when she is smoking weed due to secondhand smoke, the issue was disregarded. Recently, Stephanie moved, and I helped Steve while she mostly stood around watching. Her place looked like it was recently featured on *Hoarders*. That day, Stephanie took Chloe to the ER for **the flu** as Urgentcare won't see her without insurance. Later, I told Steve about the Affordable Care Act and how he could get insurance for himself and Chloe. The next day, Steve asked Stephanie for Chloe\u2019s social security number to enroll her, and Stephanie freaked out, saying, I don't even give Chloe's SSN to the state! She claimed Chloe was already insured and when asked by Steve who the insurer was, she mumbled something vague. I directly asked, \u201cWho is she insured through then?\u201d and Stephanie snapped, yelling, \u201cWE ARE HER PARENTS!\u201d When we left, Steve said, \u201cSee what I\u2019m dealing with? How she snapped at you?\u201d I replied that she had a point\u2014it\u2019s not really my business. What do you think? Was I an asshole for asking who insures her child? EDIT: I wanted to add that I have already advised him to get an attorney. He mentioned once that his brother is in huge debt over attorney fees to get time with his own daughter. I let him know that many attorneys will work with you and let you pay in monthly installments and he was very receptive. I was going to include that in the original post but was limited to 3000 characters. Why he hasn't done this already? I don't know, I mean I certainly would have long ago. Also that about $250 is in addition to him paying a big portion of her rent every month. SECOND EDIT: Wanted to add that I agree that my buddy should have taken care of this sooner. He stopped smoking weed shortly after I met him and has gotten and new job and is getting his life together, but Stephanie has made not made it easy for him to be a good dad by alienating Chloe from him and his side of the family. Her need for control is so great that she won't allow Steve to spend time with the child alone, and she wouldn't give the SSN to Steve because she perceives it as getting one over on her. When Steve asked her for the SSN so he could insure Chloe at **no cost to her** she should be happy to oblige, not adversarial. She isn't working at co-parenting and **he clearly is.** As far as child support what more should he be doing? He already pays a big portion of the rent and whenever she calls him for money, he never says no or doesn't give her money when she asks so I'm not sure what more he should be doing. ",

        "selftext": "My mother in law (wife\u2019s mom) initiated a divorce from her 2nd husband late in 2022. NC law requires couples to live separately for a year before divorce proceedings can occur. She asked to move into our house, which gave her our bonus room. This room is a 12x24 room, with carpet, a closet, full bathroom for herself attached to the room. She moved into our house on 12/31/22 and began paying rent ($500 per month for the first year, then she volunteered an extra $100 per month for the 2nd year to cover Netflix access and increases in HOA dues and utilities). She just moved out last month into her new home.  My wife and I knew we needed our flooring downstairs replaced, and we wanted to go ahead and do our stairs, main hallway, primary bedroom. The bonus room we had decided to also get done, since the carpet had been lived on 24/7 for 2 years. My mother in law worked from home so she essentially spent her time in that room working, relaxing, or sleeping. She also had a dog with her.  We felt it wasn\u2019t right to charge her the cost of the upgraded flooring we wanted, so we asked the flooring estimator to send us a separate price for similar carpet in the bonus room so that we could present that price to her. We were told the LVP option was $2500, the carpet option was $1400. We advised her of the $1400 in November, and told her it wasn\u2019t expected up front, nor would we ask for it after she closed on her new home. We were willing to work with her on it. Flash forward a month and she\u2019s moved out, and she asks to speak with us about the carpet payment. She isn\u2019t sure why she\u2019s being asked to pay $1400 when she thought it was our plan all along to change the flooring anyways. Mind you, this carpet was new and used as a toddler playroom for about an hour each day prior to her arrival. She and I decided to agree to reduce it to $500 because she felt she should have been able to at least get the carpets cleaned, which would have cost $500. We denied this request initially because we knew that carpet cleaning wasn\u2019t going to remove the wear and tear of her existence. Well, once we agree on $500, she asks about the $100 I had agreed to refund her for some car work I had done. I agreed to it and figured we were done.  Next, my wife finds out about this agreement and immediately calls her mom to discuss in frustration. Her mom decides to \u201coblige\u201d to $1400 but then begins to say how she incurred extra costs from her car repairs because I wasn\u2019t able to fix her car, and that it should cover her $1400. She also mentioned that her extra $100 per month should have covered the cost as well, even though that was never agreed upon.  Of course, since this all happened right before the holidays, we just agreed to accept $400. We\u2019ve seen eachother a few times without issue, but there\u2019s still some bitterness, especially with the comments about how she now had to pay a bigger sum of money for her car repairs.  AITA? ",

Every time that one of these guys comes over, our bathroom smells like a fishy sewer for days afterward. Every. Single. Time.  We keep re-caulking the toilet but it doesn't even matter because the next time he comes over, it's back. Both of these men are significantly heavier than us but one of them lived with us for the better part of a year and we never had this issue. Friend #2 must be doing something ~extra~ on the toilet that's causing this right??  My partner feels uncomfortable saying anything to him about it (understandably) but we are both disgusted even standing in our own bathroom. It feels dirty and nauseating and takes days for the smell to fade. WIBTA if I banned him from using our home bathroom? WIBTA if I put a sign up in the bathroom indirectly addressing the issue??  This all feels ridiculous for my own home bathroom but I'm at a loss LOL  ETA: We called the plumber today and they're coming next week to check it out. \ud83e\udee1  Also adding: This man does not smell otherwise so it's not a hygiene thing. We are not aware of any medical issue (doesn't mean it doesn't exist). And it's not clearly a poop smell or pee smell. It's distinct. We don't think he's wiping out the bathroom every time he comes over. ",

Her preferred method of traveling is without him (I won\u2019t get started on my thoughts about that).My birthday is Middle of Jan and hers is 5 days later. Last November she decided she wanted to go on a trip for her birthday. Conveniently it was \u201cfor our birthdays even though I went in support to what she wanted to do and we traveled all day on my birthday.  When she brought up the trip in the beginning, I mentioned my son going and that he would be really interested. She gave 100 reasons for him to not go, and asked if I still wanted to take him\u2026.  \u201cUmmm yeah\u2026\u201d she flipped out. Said if he comes, she wants to go to Hawaii for 3 weeks without him. I tossed it back at her and said if he doesn\u2019t come, can we do a family vacation for 3 weeks to Hawaii with him \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd2f, yeah didn\u2019t go over well.

I\u2019ve also been sleeping on the couch because it\u2019s more comfortable with my shoulder.

        "selftext": "My (29F) daughter is five months old and goes to a daycare at my husband\u2019s (32M) workplace. My mother in law also works at the same place so she has easy access to the daycare. At least once a week she goes and spends 30 minutes to an hour just playing with my daughter. This rubs me the wrong way for so many reasons. As a mom, it frustrates me that she thinks it\u2019s okay to just drop by whenever without at least saying something or asking (I actually just found out while writing this that she tells my husband but nobody communicates it with me). As a former daycare worker, I would have hated having someone just come in and spend time with a child because now not only do they have infants to watch, but now they have to work around a fully grown woman and make sure that she isn\u2019t taking pictures/videos of other babies as well. I think my biggest issue is honestly that some days she gets to spend more awake time with my daughter than I do and I know that\u2019s a horrible reason to be frustrated with someone but it is what it is. Would I be the asshole if I asked her to stop visiting daycare so frequently? She comes to our house and gets to spend several hours with my daughter at least once a week so it\u2019s not like daycare is the only time she gets to see her.   ETA: Yes. I know I\u2019m the asshole for being jealous. After talking with my husband, I\u2019m realizing a lot of these feelings are based on big emotions from being exhausted and PPD. I don\u2019t hate my mother in law. This is my first and probably only child and she\u2019s my rainbow baby so I\u2019m very protective. For those of you that politely told me I\u2019m the asshole, thank you. For those of you that told me I need to see a therapist, already seeing one for my chronic depression and added postpartum depression so I\u2019m good. I\u2019m going to stop reading comments now and go snuggle with my baby that just got home. ",

        "selftext": "I (27F) have a strange living situation. I live with a family (Chris, 65M, Danielle, 59F, and their daughter) and do household chores in exchange for rent. I've lived here for 19 months; it's mostly smooth sailing. I work full-time and am applying to law school. Danielle has some issues with boundaries (she doesn't understand why she can\u2019t enter my room w/o permission, for example), and I know it's both due to age differences and the fact that they allow me to live in their house for free. I have to be very careful when enforcing boundaries. Yesterday, I made dinner for everyone after a full day of chores. Around 10 pm, as I was finishing the dishes, Danielle told me I needed to steam clean the carpet in the living room because the cats had peed all over it. I did, and as I was putting the steam cleaner away, Danielle entered and said she wanted me to do another room. Because it was 10:30 at this point and I still wanted to work on an application before bed, I politely but firmly said, I'm not going to do that. I probably should have said, I'll do it tomorrow, but I was exhausted, so I just said no. I put the machine away, submitted my application, and went to bed. Tonight, as I was finishing up my meal prep for the week, Danielle cornered me in the kitchen. I don't want to fight about this, she said, But I wanted to mention something. Last night when you told me you weren't going to clean the other room, I found it rude. You should be careful when you say things like that at work so that you don't get fired. I was floored. I snapped, Danielle, you haven't had a job since before I was born. You don't get to give me advice about how to act in the workplace. Danielle rolled her eyes and huffed, See, I didn't want to fight about this, and walked out of the room. I called after her, Then maybe don't bring it up?!? Danielle hasn't spoken to me since, and I don't know what's coming. For context, Danielle has only had one job in her whole life, from age 22 to age 25. After that, she quit to raise kids. I grew up very poor. I have been working since I was 14 and supporting myself since I turned 18. They offered to start our arrangement in 2023 because they needed help around the house and I was struggling financially. As for Danielle's work advice, I currently work as a Regional Manager at a small firm. Not only is her advice outdated, but I can't take it. I'm a people manager; a lot of my day-to-day job involves being polite but unyielding. I think she was frustrated by my setting a boundary and that's why she brought it up. I know part of my frustration is that I feel powerless to protest most of the time. I will be moving out in August of this year when I go to law school (hopefully!), and my goal is just to make it until then. I'm also really frustrated that Danielle felt like she could say whatever she wanted and then walk away as if I had no right to feel anything. AITA for what I said? UPDATE: First, as an aside, a lot of the comments here missed the point. Danielle was not angry with me for refusing to do an additional chore at 10:30pm; that was not the issue. Even by the most generous of understandings, demanding additional overtime work at the end of a 14-hour shift is unreasonable, and she knew that. During our follow-up discussion, she added a detail I had totally forgotten about \u2013 the second room in question has a large potted Fiddle-Leaf Fig tree in it, and in order to steam clean the additional room, the tree needs to be moved. Neither she or I were able to move it after multiple attempts, so at that point I said, \u201cUntil Chris and I can figure out a way to move this, the steam cleaning will have to wait. I know you want it done tonight, but I will not be doing that.\u201d Very important context that I missed adding when I was angry. The issue in question was the exchange the next day. As to how I responded the second day when she came to confront me on my wording, for that, I understand now that I was absolutely the asshole. As one of my close friends put it to me, \u201cThose are inside thoughts.\u201d My context about her work history was also unnecessary and irrelevant. Last night, I approached Danielle and opened the conversation with a profuse apology. No qualifiers, no protests, just that I was rude during our kitchen conversation and I needed to apologize. She in turn immediately apologized for her incredibly poor introduction to the follow-up conversation and for cornering me in the kitchen while I was otherwise occupied instead of meeting with me at a more neutral time. Chris then joined us and we had an extensive conversation. During the conversation, I asked them to define how they view our arrangement. They were immediately very clear that they don\u2019t see me as a tenant, employee, or servant. I pointed out that if that is how they want to view things, then I need to be free to say no extra requests. They were receptive to this. I also pointed out that in our state, I could either be considered a tenant or a live-in domestic worker, but due to the length of time I\u2019ve resided here and the conditions in place, I am definitely not considered just a guest. They did get offended that I see our relationship as fundamentally a transaction, which I found kind of funny, because while they have the freedom to frame it in their minds as \u201cwe\u2019re helping this person out and she\u2019s helping us out,\u201d it\u2019s wise for me to see it differently. I do have obligations to them and my life has substantially larger implications should this not work out. In the end, they agreed that because they aren\u2019t landlords and I am not their employee (in their minds), I should be receiving more freedom than I have been given. Chris and Danielle have chronic illnesses that make most of the work I do very difficult for them, including a lot of the care I provide for their adult daughter who lives with us. We then outlined (again) exactly what my responsibilities are and what they\u2019re not. Finally, to my surprise, they apologized for previous invasions of privacy and agreed that we would put a lock on my room door. It is an interior lock only so I can\u2019t lock it while I\u2019m gone, but I am fine with the progress. I was never threatened with eviction or anything like that; people can be emotionally mature enough to talk through issues instead of immediately pulling a metaphorical trigger, which is what happened here. After the conversation, I typed out a long email detailing the terms of my living here as it currently stands and had them send a confirmation in reply. While it is not officially a lease, it is something in writing outlining responsibilities that was agreed to by all parties. We agreed that my monthly hours would be reduced to 80 instead of the roughly 100 I have been doing. If the value of that is calculated according to the federal minimum wage, that\u2019s a value of $580 every four weeks, which is more than most rooms-for-rent are in our area. Of course, the labor I do is somewhat skilled and has a market value of at least double, but I used the federal minimum wage for the sake of argument. I also established that the latest I would be available for housework is 9:30pm, barring some form of emergency, and if a task absolutely requires going past that time, I will be taking that time back on a different day. I know that I will laugh at this in Contracts class in the future, but for now, I\u2019m fine with what it is. Like I said in a comment, it\u2019s not ideal but it works. I\u2019m not in a position where I desperately need this anymore, but I\u2019m going to stay here until August because being able to funnel what otherwise would be paid in rent into savings is doing wonders to set me up for the future. To everyone that commented something along the lines of \u201cYou have to do everything she says\u201d or \u201cYou\u2019re the help\u201d or \u201cYou\u2019re entitled,\u201d I encourage you to think about that perspective more. Employees, household help, and any people in a subordinate position are still very much an individual and deserving of basic respect to their space, their time, and their person. No laws, no matter how extensive, take those basic rights away. Also, if you said it was my \u201cfault\u201d for being in the situation in the first place, kick rocks. We are all working through our own situations where we pick the best option available even if it isn\u2019t perfect. That\u2019s not weakness or stupidity, that\u2019s life.",

My wife chose Vienna and found a flight with Ryanair priced at 60 pounds return each. She suggested we should take that flight for a 4 day trip. The flight doesn\u2019t include any luggage, with cabin luggage the flight is worth 120 each and she said we can manage without the luggage.  She said she wants to experience travelling for a cheap amount and doesn\u2019t want to spend too much. For context, we are high earners and live way below our means so this is not due to a budget constraint.  I suggested that we should at least be able to take some cabin baggage as I don\u2019t like travelling without clothes especially for a 4 day trip.

        "selftext": "I\u2019m a single dad to a 15 year old girl. We live in an area where we get a lot of snow every winter. Around the time she was 11, I taught her how to shovel and usually, we do it together. We have a decent sized driveway and walkway. Sometimes, if it\u2019s too icy, I\u2019ll do the whole thing myself. Over the weekend, we got some unexpected snow while I was at work. I called my daughter and asked that she shovel out a bit of the driveway so I\u2019ll have room to park and get out the next day, as well as shovel the walkway and steps. She said yes. When I came home, the entire driveway was shoveled and the walkway and steps were cleared perfectly. I thanked her and said she did a good job. She then told me that when she went out to shovel, she saw our neighbor (who\u2019s a couple years older than her) was shoveling his walkway. She offered him $40 of her own money to shovel for her and he accepted.  I told her that I had asked her to shovel, not the neighbor and it was something assigned to her. She asked what the big deal was, as it got done. She also pointed out when she has her own house some day, she can easily just pay someone to do it so she doesn\u2019t have to do it. I told her she wasn\u2019t in trouble but next time it snowed, she was helping me shovel and going forward if I asked her to do it, she was expected to do it. She seemed a little disappointed but didn\u2019t argue. I was talking to my mom about the situation and she told me I completely overreacted, and pointed out my daughter has a point. The job got done and it shouldn\u2019t matter how it gets done, as long as it does, and the neighbor kid willingly did it (which I confirmed with him later that he was happy to do it for the extra cash). My mom said I should\u2019ve praised my daughter\u2019s initiative.  So, now I\u2019m left wondering if I was the asshole for lecturing my daughter on this.  Edit: To those asking, she got the money from babysitting. She works for a different neighbor twice a week and is paid $18/hr. We\u2019ve had talks about money constantly over the years, ever since she was old enough to receive birthday and Christmas money and decide how to spend it. She knows the value of the dollar, that once you spend money it\u2019s gone, and to think before you buy. She says to her, this was worth the $40.  And to those asking why it bugged me, I thank you because I wasn\u2019t even sure myself. I think I just want to make sure that she has these skills, but I also understand people\u2019s points that she has the skill and she can now decide to use it if she\u2019s in a situation like this one.  **Update*** I want to thank everyone who talked some sense into me. You all were right, it really doesn\u2019t matter how it gets done. As well as the fact that yes, there are times I contract out work of my own, so it\u2019s unfair to expect otherwise of her. One of my main priorities is that she\u2019s able to do things on her own. I won\u2019t always be around to help and I want her to be independent. But, I realize now, this was her being independent and getting something done, just in a different way. I spoke with her and apologized for lecturing her. I also added I was proud of her for taking initiative and explained why I reacted the way I did. Additionally, I thanked her for getting it done, regardless of how it was. She forgave me and everything is good now. We did have another talk about money but she insists that\u2019s how she wanted to spend it, so I\u2019m going to leave it alone for now. But she says she appreciates me admitting I was wrong. I told her next time, she can either hire the neighbor again or do it herself, I don\u2019t care as long as it\u2019s what they both want.  Some people said I should force her to put more into savings. She already puts a good amount away on her own. I\u2019m going to continue to let her decide what works for her.  Also, to those going to either extreme that either 1) I was wrong for having her shovel because she\u2019s a girl or 2) assuming I\u2019m only making her do chores and expecting her to do them herself because she\u2019s a girl, you\u2019re wrong. I do everything that I ask her to do, and I also occasionally contract out tasks. I don\u2019t care if she does in the future. This was a genuine mistake on my part and not anything malicious where I expect more/less of my daughter because she\u2019s a girl. ",

        "selftext": "So, a little context: I (35M) am getting married to my fianc\u00e9, Audrey (29F), in a few months. My brother, Steve (30M), has been dating his girlfriend, Lisa (28F), for about a year now. I\u2019ve never really clicked with Lisa, but we\u2019ve always been cordial. She\u2019s kind of loud and opinionated. She also has a tendency to interrupt people when they\u2019re talking, and it drives me nuts. Here\u2019s where it gets tricky. A few weeks ago, my mom mentioned that I \u201creally should\u201d invite Lisa to the wedding, even though I didn\u2019t initially plan to. I told my mom that I was keeping the guest list tight, and that it was more about the vibe of the event. I didn\u2019t think it would be an issue since Lisa and I aren\u2019t close. But my mom started pushing, saying that if I didn\u2019t invite Lisa, it would be \u201csuper awkward\u201d for Steve and that \u201cfamily is important.\u201d I still didn\u2019t budge, and my mom seemed to accept it. However, I was talking to Steve yesterday, and he brought up the wedding. He casually mentioned that Lisa was upset she wasn\u2019t invited, and that it was \u201cweird\u201d that she was left out when she\u2019s been dating him for a year. He said that it would mean a lot to him if I reconsidered. I told him I didn\u2019t want to cause drama, but I just didn\u2019t feel comfortable inviting someone I don\u2019t get along with to my wedding. He got kind of quiet and then said, \u201cI guess I\u2019ll just skip the wedding, then,\u201d and walked off. Now, I\u2019m feeling conflicted. I don\u2019t want to lose my brother over this, but I also don\u2019t think it\u2019s my responsibility to make space for someone who isn\u2019t really part of my life, especially on such a personal day.",

        "selftext": "My 18yo daughter lives at home - as she should since she is not at college or working in a full time job. She graduated high school in 2024 and has a part time job.  She does not drive. My husband and I drive her to work, to her community activities, to hang out with friends, and to dates. She recently asked if she could have 5 people over for her birthday and for a sleepover. We said no. We told our kids that parties are fine through their 18th birthday and for graduation but after that we only have family celebrations. Our reasons: It's a small place and we'd be on top of each other.  After working our jobs all week and juggling her and her brother's activities, we need some calm and quiet. Also, we don't know these kids.  Having them over for a couple of hours is something I can gear myself up for, but an open-ended time of strangers in my space... my heart is racing as I'm typing this.  It makes me super anxious. Daughter knows this (about the anxiety) but has been arguing that it's not a big deal, everyone else does it, and I never have people over.  She has had people over from time to time, but since she and her friends are all dependent on rides, it doesn't happen often. I floated the idea of a 2-3 hour hangout but since she argued with us for about 20 minutes, my husband is like 'nope. not gonna happen. I understand that she's disappointed and wants to hang out with her friends for her birthday. So, reddit, would I be the asshole for not hosting a party for my daughter's 19th birthday? UPDATE 9:55 pm. Some thought provoking questions in the comments. No sleepovers ever? Yes, from around 2nd grade to age 16 we hosted a couple every year - except during Covid, of course.  She hasn't been interested for a few years.  Why doesn't she drive? Lost her driver's license after causing 2 accidents in 3 months.  Thankfully, only damage from the accidents was to the cars; all people involved were fine. However, insurance dropped her and threatened to drop us if she didn't surrender her license. How are you  trying to help her? I've been trying to get her to try for her driver's license again but I'm meeting with resistance.  Talked about the pros and cons of several career opportunities but she doesn't want to have anything to do with it.  Going to counseling, but she seems to use it as a vent session - which can be helpful! - rather than taking the homework and following through with the counselor's advice. Honestly, I know that I need to step up here and take the lead.  Humans tend to do a much or as little as is expected of them; I need to help her raise her expectations. Why isn't she in college? She's not interested in post secondary education right now. She may go back later, and I'm fine with that.  Why doesn't she have a full time job? She doesn't know what she wants to do.  She's currently refusing to look for a full time and I'm not willing to kick her out.  I know a lot of folks do that to their kid when they become an adult, but I don't want to.  I love her and like having her around, knowing she's safe.  Honestly, as a parent I am struggling with how to help her without pushing her away.  ",

        "selftext": "I have a group of lady friends who plan regular get togethers. Most of us are connected through Carla (not her real name) who is our unofficial matriarch. She plans the events, they are usually at her house and when we do trips out of town, she pays for the Airbnb on her card and we pay her our portion. The most recent upcoming trip has an indoor pool. We go do these parties and pretty much let loose. There\u2019s drinking, and shenanigans. We\u2019re silly af.  To be clear we\u2019re old ladies. Most of us are moms and about half of us are grandmas. Carla asked how the group would feel if her grandbabies came for a swim in the morning. We established some guidelines- like not just Carla\u2019s grandkids could be invited, but only toddlers can come for the swim and they had to be brought by a female (or female presenting- this is a ladies weekend after all). There would be a strict time frame and we didn\u2019t plan on curtailing our behavior- so fair warning I guess. The group was divided, some feeling like they would feel stifled and it would change the whole vibe, others feeling like a morning time would not interfere with the craziness and it would be fun. I suggested that we do a vote, majority rules.  Here\u2019s where I might be the ahole. When the verdict was in, one person, we\u2019ll call her Jen, said she was out. She didn\u2019t want to come because the vote didn\u2019t go her way. I told her she was being a spoiled brat, and that she was having a childish petty tantrum just because she wasn\u2019t getting her way. Jen told me she didn\u2019t want to pay for something when she didn\u2019t agree with the way things went and that I should \u201crespect her boundaries\u201d. This isn\u2019t the first time that Jen has said or done something sideways, but it is the first time I called her out. Now I\u2019m wondering if I\u2019m the one being petty. So Reddit?

But we\u2019ve worked through a lot this past year and I know he is trying to put in more effort. He told me recently that he was going to pay someone to come deep clean our house as my birthday present. To be fair, I have said many times that I would love to have this done but it isn\u2019t something we need to be spending money on right now so we haven\u2019t done it.  He followed this up by saying that if I didn\u2019t want to spend the money, he would gladly just take the whole day and do it himself. When he told me this, I wanted to be very mindful of my reaction. Again, he has not been in the habit of gift giving or being super thoughtful when it comes to special occasions. I told him that I really appreciated the thought and saw the effort that would take for him to do but if he took the entire day to clean the house, I would obviously just be watching my kids and trying to keep them from coming behind him and messing all of his hard work up and ultimately that doesn\u2019t sound like a present. I felt guilty because I want to praise his effort but I also feel like this \u201cgift\u201d doesn\u2019t feel personal or thought out well, despite the effort.

Now I have to get out of bed to turn it off, and I HATE it... Like I don't even know how to describe how much it annoys and irritates me... I am not a morning person, and he knows this, and I have my own morning routine as to make sure I am not grumpy towards everyone in the morning. But turning off his alarm messes up my routine and makes me really frustrated in the morning. Even more so when he asks me to turn off his alarm on my day off. My bf has his own company and prefers to be early at his office. So his alarm is usually set about 40 minutes before my alarm. But sometimes it is also set 10 minutes before my alarm goes off. He will ask me to 'please turn it off one more time' and then stay in bed till my alarm goes. Now this is where I might be the AH, because the extra time in bed he mostly spends cuddling me and I really love it. Before this all started he used to turn off his alarm himself and come back to bed to cuddle, but that doesn't happen anymore.

Walking inside, I heard muffled music. Getting closer to our bedroom, I heard him in the shower singing along to something we'd never listened to before, and...I was blown away. A little background: my husband is quiet and reserved. He's very stoic and just doesn't like small talk, huge crowds, hates being the center of attention, etc. He also has a very unique voice, he's slim, but his voice is deep and very even-keel. There's been times we've been at karaoke bars and people have prodded him about getting up there and he always says something like: you've heard me talk, what makes you think I can do that? or do you really want this place to clear out? In the shower, he wasn't belting out, but he was singing along and he was good. Really good. I was shocked and frozen for a bit, but then turned and left, got in my car, drove down the street, and texted him that I'd be home in a bit. A couple minutes later he replied and I sat there for a bit wondering how I can possibly bring it up. I went in, and it was like any other day. He was in our room, hair still wet, Bluetooth speaker right back on the dresser where it always was. I didn't bring it up. For the next few days, it's really all I could think about. I'm not proud of this, but when he was out shoveling and salting the driveway, I took his phone and went into his Spotify, he had to've had something in there, and lo and behold at the bottom of his usual playlists there was one titled random. I opened it and there it was. All artists he'd never once listened to with or around me: some Bruno Mars, Shawn Mendes, Michael Buble, James Arthur, Lukas Graham, some much older stuff like the Four Tops, Stevie Wonder, and Dion...and then I saw it. Die A Happy Man by Thomas Rhett. Something I forgot to mention earlier. My husband HATES country music. He never complains when others are playing it, but if anyone asks him what he wants to listen to, he says anything but country. Says he hates the twanginess of it and thinks all of the artists are poser cowboys. Die a Happy Man is my song. I don't listen to it around him because he hates country, but it's my favorite. Years ago, when we were dating, I remember we talked about our favorite songs. He mentioned a few, and I said mine. It's the only time I've ever brought it up. He nodded and acknowledged, but said he wasn't a country fan and didn't know it. The fact that he remembered it, saved it, knows it, and even more than that, that he may be able to sing it, is burning me up. I want to hear him sing. I want to ask him so badly, but I'm afraid of how he may react. It's innocent, but it's still a breach of trust and if he hasn't told me or any of his friends or family then this is something he probably really wants to keep to himself forever.

The vet has said as the growth gets bigger, it's more likely to rupture, which would require urgent veterinary care. At that point, it's likely that Sky would need to be euthanized. It's possible that this could happen outside of our vet's usual hours, which would mean we'd need to take him to the emergency animal hospital. Given all of this, I've tried talking with Emma several times about whether it is still in Sky's best interests to continue on. I think the time has come to have him euthanized. This would allow us to ensure that his passing was as gentle as possible, in a place that is familiar and without the added stress of a medical emergency. The vet has said it's up to us, and he'd support whatever decision we made. Emma thinks that we shouldn't put him down just because things have become harder for us. He does still wag his tail when he sees us and enjoys scratches, but the vet has said that dogs can be really good at hiding when they're in pain, and I think that's what's happening here. Emma doesn't see it that way and thinks that because he's not overtly suffering, we should let him live out whatever life he has left. Also relevant: I work from home, so I'm the one at home with him every day. We've discussed what I should do if something happens and she's away for work. She's told me I should do what needs to be done even if I can't get hold of her or she can't get there. It seems she's accepted that he's close to the end of his life but maybe doesn't want to have to be the one to make the decision to end it? Yesterday, I had a sudden thought that I should just tell Emma that something happened during a time when she's not available and take him to the vet myself. It shook me that I'd thought of it, to be honest. Our relationship is built on a strong foundation of trust, and I know that if I were to do something like this and she found out, there would be no coming back from that. Our 20-year relationship would be over. However, I can't stop thinking about how it could be the best thing for Sky. So, I thought I'd ask the internet: would I be the a-hole if I had my wife's dog put down and lied to her about why? UPDATE: Thank you to everyone who has taken the time to share their stories. I really appreciate all the comments (yes, I\u2019ve read them all) and I\u2019m going to take the advice to continue talking with Emma about what\u2019s best for Sky. Hopefully, I can help her realize that it\u2019s time for us to say goodbye but if not, I\u2019ll continue to support them both as best I can through this difficult process. ",

He was working very minimally at a restaurant. I didn\u2019t make a big deal about it, because I figured he was taking a \u201cbreak\u201d after HS.  So, he got the semi-FT job at this landscaping company in the middle of July.  Everything was going well until fall.  He decided not to go to technical school or college.  Well, school isn\u2019t for everyone.  The problem I have is that since the end of October, he hasn\u2019t been working hardly at all.  We live in the Midwest, so there is no lawn mowing or landscaping after October.  So, right now he is working even less hours at the restaurant and maybe shovels snow once every so often.

        "selftext": "I have avoided having this conversation with my wife for years. It has been obvious but not said that I don\u2019t trust her to go out alone with them not in our yard but anywhere busy. We live in a busy road and the sidewalk is in the other side of the street. She is completely blind and my kids are 4 and 7 my seven year old is pretty self sufficient but my 4 year old tries to run a head and is a little bit of a flight risk. She was telling me she cleans more than her share (she doesn\u2019t work I do), so I called her out on it. I cook every meal, sweep and mop the floors and spend more time with the kids work and on top of it I get the kids ready for school and walk them to school every school day. She then said she could walk the kids to school but I won\u2019t let her. I told her straight up no I do not think it\u2019s safe. She knows other blind mothers and I\u2019m sorry they are great in so many ways, but I do think there are some things that worry me about her being out in public alone with the kids. If someone grabbed my daughter she would have no recourse. If my son took off she would see where he went or be able to stop him. We live on a busy street and she can cross it no problem but it\u2019s about having to stop my child if they make an error crossing. When I walk my kids to school I hold their hands she has to have one hand on her cane and I\u2019ve seen my son pull away from her when we were out together.  I really am asking am I an asshole for getting upset that I felt she was unjustly saying she does everything and saying something that hurt her feelings. Not so much for thinking the way I do. She had not talked to me since and honestly I\u2019m mad too. I do a lot for my family and being told I am not pulling my weight makes me angry. I don\u2019t know where I go from here. I don\u2019t know if my anger and position make me the AH or if it was justified for me to say the things I said. Edit:It\u2019s pretty clear that I am the ass here one thing I wanted to say. I\u2019m sure most people here don\u2019t understand that sometimes when it comes to being blind its not just find a solutions sometimes you need the assistance of someone sighted. And I am not alone in thinking this she has an instructor who teaches her navigation and she also expressed concerns about my wife\u2019s navigation abilities without a guide dog. She doesn\u2019t have one because she doesn\u2019t have enough use for them to giver her one. They need to work often or they forget how to work properly we do not live near busses and she doesn\u2019t work so there is little opportunity to use a guide dog. Walking the kids to school is just one route there is nothing enough. I didn\u2019t put this post because my thinking she can\u2019t do it safely you guys don\u2019t have enough info to have a take on if she can you don\u2019t watch her walk. I was saying my saying it made me the ass.  Also it\u2019s pretty clear that the biggest issue is we are raising two kids with no family support what so ever her mother lives 5 minutes away but only see our children or my spouse once every month or two and even then only for a couple hours. My parents live far away. No one is not doing their share but we are both over worked. Edit 2. I talked to my wife and things are mostly cleared up. She knew I would say that and agrees she was just mad that it was not talked about. She has never gone out with the kids alone and it had become an understanding without a conversation. We both apologized and she did say (like a lot of you said) that she wasn\u2019t trying to say I wasn\u2019t doing enough more that she was struggling to keep up with the laundry and needed help. Just wasn\u2019t communicating well on both our sides  Edit 3. I clearly did not give enough details in the initial post I was writing fast which is also why there are typos",

We have a group a friends we get together with for Christmas/secret santa every year for the past 5 years. Each year, she would buy a gift for her secret santa and also put together a small gift for all our friends. At first since we were the ones hosting, I thought it was just a small party favor. But she does this every year even when we aren't hosting. These gifts usually consist of some chocolates, some writing utensils, some handsoap/candle/hand sanitizer from bath and body works. Since most of the people in our group are guys, they don't use most of what she gives. They feel like they are obligated to get her something too. I told my wife that most of it goes unused, but she said that she continues to do it because she just likes to give them gifts and expects nothing in return, and since we usually celebrate after the holidays are over, she's not spending more than $15/person. I finally just told her that no one likes the little gifts she gives them and she should just stop. She got really quiet and hasn't talked to me since. I know she enjoys giving gifts but why waste your money on people who don't appreciate it? Aita?",

        "selftext": "Some context to start out: I\u2019m self employed and occasionally do work for my friend and his girlfriend (they\u2019re not married but I\u2019ll say MIL to keep it simple). They have 4 young kids together. I\u2019ll be referring to my friend as \u201cJoe\u201d and his girlfriend as \u201cMary\u201d. Ok, here\u2019s what happened: I was working and get a voice message from Mary saying that she\u2019s at the hospital with one of the kids because he\u2019s having seizures and tells me that if I have any questions about the job I\u2019m on, to message Joe instead. (Turns out Joe is also at the hospital but I wasn\u2019t told this. This\u2019ll be important later) I drive past their house and see that Joe\u2019s van is on the driveway and think to myself \u201coh, Joe is home, he must be looking after the 3 other kids while Mary is at the hospital\u201d A short while later I get a message from Joe asking me to call him. I\u2019m about to stop at their house to pick-up something off the driveway that I need for the job so I think \u201cwell I\u2019m stopping at their\u2019s anyway, I\u2019ll just talk to Joe then instead of calling\u201d (I was less than a minute from their house). So I pull up and walk into the house and Joe\u2019s MIL is in the living room with the kids (I\u2019m very familiar with MIL, she\u2019s a friend of my parents since before I was born). I ask \u201cis Joe home?\u201d And she says \u201cno\u201d I say \u201coh ok, nevermind. I\u2019ll just call him\u201d She says \u201cwhy? You can tell me.\u201d (Remember Joe asked me to call him, I don\u2019t know what he wants to talk to me about) I say \u201cit\u2019s probably just work stuff\u201d Then out of nowhere she speaking very angrily at me, almost shouting and says \u201cwhy won\u2019t you just tell me?! Joe and Mary don\u2019t need this stress when [kid\u2019s name] is in the hospital! They don\u2019t need this shit and I don\u2019t need to deal with your attitude!\u201d I just say (I\u2019m still talking normally btw) \u201cJoe asked me to call him, I didn\u2019t know he\u2019s at the hospital too, I thought he was home\u201d She\u2019s standing right in front of me now with a face like thunder and shouts \u201cGO ON THEN CALL HIM! CALL HIM! CALL HIM THEN!\u201d I don\u2019t say anything, I just look at her like \u201cwhat the fuck are you on about?\u201d I walk out the front door and she slams it hard behind me and I just say \u201cyou fucking bitch\u201d She then opens the door again and says \u201cwhat did you say?\u201d I said \u201cI called you a fucking bitch\u201d She then calls me a dickhead and a few other insults are throw. I pick up the thing I needed from the driveway and leave. I call Joe and tell him his MIL just had a go at me and I explain what happened. (Guess what: the stuff he wanted to talk to me about was in fact just work stuff) I also explained what happened to Mary and she hasn\u2019t responded. I\u2019ve also been taken off the work van insurance (it\u2019s in Mary \u2019s dad\u2019s name) and I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s just it now. Looking back I guess she\u2019s stressed about one of her grandkids being in the hospital but that\u2019s no reason to blow up on me like that over nothing. AITA?

Me and my wife got into a pretty big argument recently and I need unbiased opinions.\u00a0 I feel like I've always been closer to my sons rather than my daughters. You know I'm a boy, I like boy stuff, so do they. I don't like princesses or dolls. So I've always gravitated towards my sons because we have more in common.\u00a0 Anyways the argument started after my wife had put the kids to bed one night. I was laying down and she came into the room and confronted me about what my 7yo daughter had just told her. According to my wife, as she was tucking my daughter into bed she started crying and asked, \u201c Why doesn't daddy like me\u201d. My wife told me that the kids notice how I treat them differently and I needed to stop acting like I hated my daughters. I told her I don't hate them, but we don't have anything in common. She was pissed and started yelling at me about how immature I was being immature. I think it's stupid. Obviously dads are going to be closer to their sons, that's just how the brain works. I tried explaining this to her and she just didn't listen. She left and I think she went to sleep in my daughter's bed. I'm not sure. So am I the asshole?

More relevant context: Aiden and Abby are dating and tend to share the same brain cell as wells fan the others flames (in the sense of causing them to be more angry) So last week I was making brownies for myself. I never bake so I decided to send a picture of the brownies to my group chat with a bunch of my friends. Abby responded with \u201cmmm I really wish I had brownies\u201d. I\u2019m a sarcastic person so I\u2019m response I said \u201cwhy do you think I made them\u201d. Dan answered my question like it was literal, so i explained that I was being sarcastic and I meant it as \u201cI\u2019m making the brownies because I was brownies too\u201d. So Aiden then messages being like \u201cwell are you going to mail her some?\u201d(I\u2019m currently on the other side of the country) And I said \u201cnah, she can bake her own brownies\u201dI didn\u2019t feel like it was too much to ask because brownies are pretty easy to make. All of a sudden Aiden was saying that I was being harsh, then Abby joined in saying that I was being rude. I tried to explain that I just felt like brownies weren\u2019t that hard to make, and I said that if Aiden wanted her to have brownies so bad then he could make them for her. They got more upset with me for that. Then Abby sends me a message saying that she didn\u2019t appreciate how I was treating her Aiden or Dan.Aiden chimes in saying it\u2019s rude to bake something and not at least say \u201ci would offer you some if you were here\u201d At this point I felt like it was inappropriate to address this in the group chat with what I thought was 5 people that had nothing to do with this. So I chose to not answer the messages and hoped they would message me privately to figure it out. Rose calls me later and tells me that despite saying nothing to me Jane is also upset. She was telling me that they were talking shit about me in a group chat I\u2019m not in.The thing that made me the most upset was that they were saying things like \u201csomeone call her so she can\u2019t escape it.\u201d, \u201cShe\u2019s being such an asshole\u201d, \u201cher boyfriend is influencing her.\u201d. Obviously it hurt to see this side of my friends. I deleted social media and ignored all their messages. Am I the asshole for this situation? Update: A bit after I posted this I did try to speak with them, however it didn\u2019t go great and they didn\u2019t like or listen to what I had to say. it essentially dragged out more of the situation with \u201cDan\u201d to which I countered that how I treat him he\u2019s fine with (him and I act like siblings in the way of like making jabs at each other) and that if he isn\u2019t fine with it he lets me know. I\u2019m still annoyed that they might\u2019ve thrown away our friendship over brownies. Dan, Rose and 2 others from the group are all still on good terms and are somewhat trying to help defuse the situation and all admit it\u2019s stupid. So this is snowballing and I\u2019m just gonna ignore them for a while :)",

She\u2019ll say stuff like \u201cChick-fil-ee\u201d instead of \u201cChick-fil-a,\u201d \u201cliberry\u201d instead of \u201clibrary,\u201d or \u201ccipatol\u201d when she means \u201ccapitol.\u201d\u00a0 It is worse when it\u2019s personal things\u2014like the city I\u2019m from or places I love. We\u2019re in \u201cChiago\u201d instead of Chicago, where I grew up, to visit my family right now, and it\u2019s like she doesn\u2019t even care. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a learning thing, either. She doesn\u2019t have dyslexia or any speach issues; she\u2019s just lazy about it, at least that's how it feels to me. She very smart, studying for her master's while working right now, so I don\u2019t get why this is so hard.\u00a0 This all came to a head today while we\u2019re staying with my parents for new years. She pronounced Chicago wrong again in front of my family, then later did the same thing with my favorite restaurant. I lost my cool and snapped at her. I told her it\u2019s frustrating that she can\u2019t even try to get it right, especially when it\u2019s stuff that matters to me. I know I probably sounded harsh, but I was just so angry. I feel like a jerk, because when we talk, it's like I'm scolding a little kid and not a 24-year-old woman who should know how to pronounce simple stuff by now.\u00a0 She got really quiet after that and has barely spoken to me since we got in. She's been on her phone the whole time and now I\u2019m starting to feel like maybe I went too far. Am I the asshole for constantly correcting her or for snapping at her today? Edit: More info. I'm going to put this here because it keeps coming up. We both grew up in northern parts of the US, so we virtually have the same typical American accent. We both only speak English. We are both white. She does not have dyslexia, vision loss, or hearing loss, but there could be things I'm not aware of. She will mispronounce most types of words: cities, restaurants, places we go, things we do, etc. She is able to pronounce these words correctly sometimes at first, but might later change her mind because they sound better the way she says them or they are easier to say her way. There are a few words she misspoke when we first met, which I thought was cute at first. But it happens so often now, over the year we've been together, that sometimes I don't understand what she says, and she can't or won't explain what she really means. She speaks this way around me, her friends, and our families. I know I'm in the wrong for yelling at her, and I will apologise for that when she wakes up, but I just want to know why she keeps doing this. If it's condition, fine, I'm a jerk, but if she's doing this for some other reason I want to know why.

        "selftext": "I m(32) was sent to the shopping centre on the way home from work to get lasagne sheets for my wife f(35). I went to the pasta aisle and took a look at the lasagne sheets on offer and found one box that stated \u201cno pre cooking required\u201d so I assumed that would be a great option and got it. Today while driving to lunch my wife said to me that she didn\u2019t mean this as an attack but that she had told me to get fresh lasagne sheets, which are the soft ones in the cold aisle. I told her I didn\u2019t hear her say fresh when she asked me or I would have probably figured out she meant cold. I then asked her what the difference was and why it mattered. She said that the fresh ones cook quicker.I responded that it does say no pre cooking required on the box, assuming maybe this was a newer technology and so it wouldn\u2019t be as long.She said that didn\u2019t matter. I then asked if she had used the no pre cooking required before and compared the cooking times to the fresh ones, since we don\u2019t make lasagne much (I can recall one time in our 7 years together) and I wouldn\u2019t think she would have used these before and was making assumptions. She then started to get angry and said that we always get the fresh ones and if she says she w at the fresh ones then that should be it and she shouldn\u2019t have to justify why she wants them, if she says to get them then just get them. I argued that I always like to educate myself and will clarify and ask questions rather than ever just go ahead and do what you\u2019re told, that isn\u2019t who I am and I should be able to ask questions and clarify. At no point did I say I wouldn\u2019t get the fresh ones in the future or that I was right to get the no pre cook ones, I\u2019m just trying to make sure I understand what the difference is and that she has also considered the differences. She then said that the way I was saying it was defensive and right fighting and that she felt I wasn\u2019t listening to her because I was asking all these questions rather than just saying \u201cyes dear\u201d.I continued to explain that I was just trying to understand and clarify, I wasn\u2019t defending that I was right to get those sheets or that I wouldn\u2019t get the fresh ones in the future but she said it didn\u2019t matter because of the way it was making her feel.She wasn\u2019t able to clarify what about my tone or words or mannerisms was making her feel that way rather than just feeling like I\u2019m trying to understand. So I don\u2019t know how to avoid this in the future but not just end up as a mindless \u201cyes dear\u201d robot. Am I the asshole because I tried to understand why she wanted fresh sheets instead of just noting to get fresh sheets next time?",

I wept, went to therapy, did what I could to improve and occasionally, she would come back into my life when she was sad or needed some compassion from her abusive ex, which she would then exit my life again to be miserable because \u201cit\u2019s what she deserved\u201d per her. Well, last time she did, I got excited, we spoke about working things out, and I told my friends she said she was not going anywhere. Well, turns out, she was trying to work things out with the abusive ex while we were talking back in June. When I saw her at the bar with the guy, I approached her for answers which she denied me. She then went up to my friends, who at the time, welcomed her with open arms because she made me happy prior to the incident that follows. Well, she attempted to be buddy buddy with them after I left out of sadness and anger. Tried to apologize for how I acted. My friend wasn\u2019t having  any of it and told her what she was doing was fucked up. Basically called her out on her bullshit and how she should feel terrible how she treated their friend (me).Fast forward a coupleMonths later, she showed up at my door. She apologized, told me answers to everything I had questions about. But when I we hang out in big social settings, my friends (the few involved of the fore-mentioned incident) don\u2019t really have an interest in talking to her right now. The ones that stood up for me basically said \u201cshe\u2019s not taken accountability to them about how she acted and is just hoping that we will sweep it under the rug toMove forward\u201d and that until she approaches them like an adult, they\u2019re not going to be the ones to build the bridge like they did before and it\u2019s up to her.When we are all hanging in a big group (think 20+ people) she just don\u2019t talk to her. That\u2019s maybe 3/20 people but my girlfriend says that she feels this approach of theirs is them \u201ctreating her like shit\u201d. Which I feel is an exaggeration and is her trying to minimize her actions that got them feeling this way towards her. AITAH?",

        "selftext": "Hi everyone. My (38f) sister (51f) (let's call her Jenny) has 5 children who are now all adults: 31m, 30m, 28f, 27m, 24m. Three of those children (30m, 28f, 27m) have either very limited contact with their mother or refuse to have contact at all. She thinks they are being selfish and ungrateful, but they all have valid reasons for not being in contact. Her daughter (let's call her Lily) now has a young child of her own and, thanks to her unwanted advances from her former housemate, she's in emergency accommodation while she waits for social housing. She has been in emergency accommodation since before Christmas.  My husband (42m) and I offered her, and her child, the use of our spare room until she gets on her feet, but she declined it because it would lower her chances of being provided her own place. The problem is that she doesn't have her own car. We have lent her my husband's car and have promised her that we would help her get a car and that we would initially pay for it, but that she would have to work off her debt by doing some cleaning and maintenance for us, and she has happily agreed.  This whole time, her mother, Jenny has shown little interest in her daughter. They don't have the best relationship as it is, and Lily feels constantly let down by Jenny. With permission from Lily, I have been updating Jenny on the situation, which has led to Jenny complaining that she only hears about Lily's situation from me. Today I  asked her if she'd be willing to spend some of her savings (that she told me about) to help get Lily a car. She was angry with me for making that suggestion while not telling Lily that she had to start spending time with Jenny.  Jenny also said that she'd been asked to do this by another sister and that she was looking for cars as we speak despite not being aware of the requirements of a car. Apparently, she wants to tell Lily  that if she wants money for a car then Lily has to let Jenny  have access to the grandchild.  Lily has not once asked Jenny for help, it is all coming from me. I told Jenny that HER daughter was HER responsibility, not mine, and that she needed to reach out and help her.  Here's where I might be TA, I was a little rude in our conversation which was over text message. I stand by what I wrote (that she had to step up and provide for her adult child), but I wasn't very kind and I let my growing frustration bubble over and it showed in the texts.  Tl;Dr: niece (and niece's child) is stranded in emergency accommodation, I told her mother to step up and provide assistance. My husband and I are planning to sell a car to her for much less than it's worth and asked her mother to contribute to the car. I was a little rude when I asked her mother to help. AITA?",

We started to talk about what our future looks like after moving in and becoming a family. I intended to hire a housekeeper to minimize chores (deep cleaning, washing baseboards, mopping, etc) beyond basic cleaning (wip down counter, occasional manual vacuuming). He said that's a waste of money, I said housechores is a waste of time. He disagrees and I told him he has a poor man mentality and will remain poor if he continues to do so. He has always said he was insecure about his career/income.  He knows he's the first blue collar man/making under 50k that I have dated in the past. My own income is also several folds higher than his, same with my friends, and all my ex bf.  I can clean up after myself when necessary (and have done so while building my career) but I was raised with the mindset that once I have made it, I should outsource the chores to buy back my time. He says I'm an AH for acting like I'm better than him and the regular people and told me to ask the regular people of reddit if I sound like a snob. I said  he should let go his toxic masculinity so he doesn't feel emasculated and start looking at the bigger picture (time is the ultimate currency) In case it's not clear: it was very clear, I would pay for housekeeping.",

She has wanted to move for years as the cost of living in our country is horrible, and she \u2018has nothing left here\u2019 (her parents passed away 2 years ago, and she is single).\u00a0 I was originally going to stay here and rent the current place we live in with my older sister [31],, and my BF [20], but my older sister has since decided that she wants to move with my mother, and that leaves me being unable to afford to live in our current house. I don\u2019t wish to leave as I have my whole life here; I just started UNI, my boyfriend and friends live here and my dog \u2018wouldn\u2019t make the trip\u2019. I am unable to work currently as I am chronically ill and am unsure of how my body would react to both full-time study and work. I get government assistance of $210/Weekly which will be unable to cover rent for anywhere but a single room in a share house but I won't be able to bring my dog. I am left in a position where I would have to financially rely on my BF more than I would like to and would be homeless if we ever broke up. I have brought these issues up to my mom and asked her for a bit more time until I qualify for student housing and can find a nice family to take my dog. However, everyone keeps saying that I am ruining this for her and that I should move overseas with them. She has dreamed of moving for years and is now \u2018able\u2019 to, but especially since her health is degrading, she is losing time to move. Should I give in and leave everything behind or do I stand my ground? EDIT:  Just want to clarify some things. - My relationship isn't new, its 2 years old.  - My dog isn't dying or old, she is just an anxious dog.  - My mom isn't actively dying, she is just getting old and has pre-existing health conditions.  - Yes, I could move to this new country but I would loose the specific program I got into that they do not offer there as well as my scholarship which would put me through Uni.  - I am currently applying to get more government assistance but it would only go into effect after she leaves  - I haven't had a job as my mother advised me not to and originally told me that she would financially support me through schooling  - pet friendly rentals are rare in Australia  - I cannot stay in my current house as the landlord doesn't want a first-time renter staying here.  - My family do not have anything lined up for them in the new place, no jobs, no education, no housing.   - I asked for them to postpone the move until the end of the year so that I can apply for student housing and rehome my dog    ",

I got irritated that he did that (also I told my brothers if they ate it they owe me money. I am broke highschool student) so I went to my brother's room and ask them for money and they said denied responsibility for eating and said that it was okay because my Dad gave it to them. I got angry at him because I told him that I didn't want them to have any of it, he said he wanted to repair the relationship between me and my brother by sharing something that I made. I don't think that it's his business to do that. He didn't seem to understand so I kind of told him off about the cake and how it hurt my feelings he still did not care. He felt like it was something useless to even talk about. Am I the ass hole for telling him off about the cake I made. Also for reference every single time I get mad or tell him off he just says I'm sorry that YOU got offended and never owns up to his action. Edit: this was not on his birthday it was 3 days after. Mom forgot to bake a cake because she has been busy with extended family passing. I also told me dad before I even baked the cake that they can't have it. Yes I wanted it to be a moment between me and my father. And no It wasn't a petty reason why I am not letting my brothers have it.",

        "selftext": "I, a 24 yo female, have been engaged to my husband for around a year now. We have a seemingly perfect relationship. We split bills properly, care for eachother, and have a good intimate life. This all started around a couple weeks ago, and I am still trying to process this situation and figure out if I am in the wrong or not.  A couple weeks prior to this taking place, me and my fianc\u00e9e were moving my things into his apartment, since it's a more spacious place, and ironically, it's closer to my workplace than my old apartment. Now here's where the trouble begins.  I am a cleanfreak. I need everything to be clean and orderly no matter where I am. That is just how I was raised because my mother has the same tendencies. We were cleaning out his room to make space for the new bed we bought, along with my other necessities I brought along with me. As we were moving out his old twin size bed, I found a tupperware container underneath the bed. It wasn't marked, nor did he tell me what it was. I assumed it was old food left under his bed since the container was foggy, so I marched to the kitchen to throw it out. Later that night, he began frantically looking for something. When I asked what he was looking for, he said he was looking for his moms ashes. I offered to help because that's what any normal person would do, and that's when the search began. I asked him what the urn looked like that he kept her in, and what he said next made my stomach drop. He said she was in a tupperware container due to the fact that he still couldn't come to terms with her passing (this was two years ago that she passed).  I turned pale, and when I told him I threw them away, he lost his mind. The story could've ended there having found them, but the only problem was, the garbage truck had already came to pick up the garbage we threw away.  Long story short, after a big argument, I am staying at my moms and my fianc\u00e9e has ceased all contact with me for the time being. I feel horrinle, but also, who keeps their moms ashes in a tupperware container?! Am I The Asshole? ",

Instead of approaching me directly, he just showed up at my house a couple times that I wasn\u2019t available. My dad told me on accident that the reason is he wants me to be part of one of his groomsmen. This kind of pissed me off because he could have called me, texted me, something to let me know he was stopping by. I hate when people show up unannounced. I work at night and sleep in the day.Not only that, but they\u2019ve been dating for like two or three years, and I barely know the guy. He hasn\u2019t really done anything to try to build a friendship with me. He sits at home and plays RuneScape all the time. Isn\u2019t his groom party supposed to be the man in his life that he can depend on to back him up during his marriage? Is it not a massive red flag that he doesn\u2019t have any fucking friends and is a total social loser? Why should I have to plug in because he can\u2019t get off the computer and go make some? Don\u2019t get me wrong, he\u2019s done a lot of good for my sister, and he\u2019s good with things like using tools.. but am I wrong in that if he wants me to be one of his groomsmen that the reason should be because we have a bond, not just because he doesn\u2019t have enough friends to fill the spot? Should it not be a big red flag to everyone that this guy doesn\u2019t have friends..? I\u2019d rather not have more responsibilities during this familial obligation. She already wanted me to take photos. How am I supposed to do that if I\u2019m part of the party?  She is my older sister, but her fianc\u00e9 is younger than me. Maybe I should be the one to initiate some time for us to hang out? But to be honest, I don\u2019t care. I\u2019m single, have my own busy life, and feel like if this guy wants me to be close to him, he needs to man up and reach out to me. Tonight I get a text message that says to give him a call when I can. I barely know this guy. I really don\u2019t wanna do it, but I also want my sister to be happy. My family all know I\u2019m outspoken and opinionated. I\u2019m not a fan and his approach to asking me is just making it worse. UPDATE: Okay MIATA.. Spoke to my sister.. he doesn\u2019t have friends and this is her idea. I don\u2019t have to take a lot of photos because they have someone doing basic photos included. I\u2019ll do it, but i\u2019m going to invite him out to get a drink or something first so that a bachelor\u2019s party isn\u2019t the first time hanging out.

As the line starts to move forward, his mom shows up with a cart full of stuff. She looked at me and explained that she was his mom. I kind of gave her a dirty look, and then I sort of meekly objected, and then she said he was in line.  EDIT:  I want to be absolutely clear that she was not in line beforehand. I\u2019m getting a lot of replies, saying how \u201cthey\u201d we\u2019re in line 1st. Incorrect. She was never in line at any point until our interaction.

I think I said \u201cyou can\u2019t have him hold your place in line.\u201d He did not have anything in his hand.  She objected and said that he was holding her place and we had a little bit of back-and-forth. I don\u2019t remember what I said. I tried to be gentle, because of the child right there. There was no cursing or yelling. But I did say something like \u2026 I can\u2019t remember. I just think I reiterated my point that she can\u2019t have him hold her place Eventually, she acquiesced and let me go ahead. I thanked her and then waited until my turn came up. I paid cash and had exact change ready. As I was leaving, I thanked her again. I did not wait for a response. ",

        "selftext": "AITA for telling my girlfriend my friend said she was ugly? I\u2019ll be as honest as I can because i genuinely want to know what people think or if we\u2019re just overreacting. Keep in mind everyone in this story is 17-18. I was at a party with my friend, and he made a remark that my girlfriend was ugly. He was just like \u201cwell she\u2019s ugly anyways\u201d. He says things like this a lot and dismisses them as jokes. I can\u2019t remember too much from the party since I was a little drunk but from what I can remember she was brought up and he said it. We weren\u2019t even talking about her negatively or positively she just happened to be part of the conversation. Anyways, when I\u2019m home I\u2019m on call with her and I tell her he was saying stuff which kind of pissed me off and I was a bit stressed. She asked what and I told her what he said. Admittedly I do kind of regret telling her since if one of her friends called me ugly I probably wouldn\u2019t be too happy and this could have saved a lot of drama. But she was very much not happy with him. She\u2019d told lots of her friends about the situation and one of which is friends with my friend.  Now the next day at work me and my friend were talking and my girlfriend came up, and I told him that she really didn\u2019t like him anymore. This led to him finding out I told her. I can\u2019t even really describe his reaction. It was like angry and confused and bewildered. He told me I shouldn\u2019t have told her that and that I\u2019m useless and she\u2019s being too oversensitive and that he only said it as a joke. To add to that last part he said he\u2019s always thought she\u2019s good for me and good looking. But I don\u2019t know why he\u2019d just say she\u2019s ugly. It isn\u2019t even funny. No one even laughed at it. Like why would you joke about that.  That last part is important because like I said earlier he says lots of stuff as a \u201cjoke\u201d and never knows when he\u2019s crossed a line. And since one of his friends is friends with my girlfriend too, they\u2019ve been talking about it and he\u2019s lost a friend because their mutual friend sided with her. So he isn\u2019t too happy with me. He says he\u2019s mad at me because I told her and he\u2019s mad at my girlfriend for being too sensitive.  Finally today we had a talk about it and I told him that she has every right to be upset and he really shouldn\u2019t joke about this stuff because it isn\u2019t funny and just degrading towards her. He never actually apologised.  I do feel a bit awful because I caused quite a bit of drama, we didn\u2019t have a big argument at work but it was quite a heated conversation and now there\u2019s rumours going round saying we\u2019ve had some massive argument. I feel like in some way we\u2019re both in the wrong.  And by the way, obviously my girlfriend is not ugly. This isn\u2019t even just my opinion it\u2019s fact. I\u2019m very proud to say in the time I\u2019ve been dating her I\u2019ve never heard a single bad remark about her other than this.  TLDR: I told my girlfriend my friend said she was ugly, he found out and was mad about that. ",

        "selftext": "I (24m) have a selfish and narcissistic sister, 'Sarah' (18f). I have written a post about her a few months ago, and explained why she's selfish and narcissistic . So, I don't think I need to expand on that anymore. But here's the story; Last Sunday, I cleaned the entire house, all by myself, around 1am because it's easier to do when everyone else is asleep. I cleaned the ceiling fan in the living room, dusted the shelves and frames, swept the floor, vacuumed the floor, and mopped the floor. I have no trouble doing these because I'm always home since I'm still studying, and my elder sister is working. So, it's fair for me to do the chores, although my elder sister helps out as well with the laundry and folding the clothes (I fold my own clothes).  Why don't our younger sister help out? Like I've said, I've made a post about it, and it's a pretty long story. To cut it short, she's simply just lazy, selfish, and narcissistic. Today, Sarah saw a bug or whatever and used a lizard spray to kill it. Lizard spray is more dense and oily compared to a mosquito spray. Why did she use a lizard spray when we have a mosquito spray? I honestly have no clue. So, I told her to mop the floor since the floor is oily and I just cleaned the house a few days ago. To me it's fair since she was the one who caused the mess and I was the one who cleaned the house. But she got defensive, saying Why me? Why do I have to mop the floor? (goes to show how narcissistic she is). I kept quiet and just gave her a look. She then got a wet tissue and wiped the floor, instead of mopping it (goes to show how lazy she is). Not only that, but she didn't even wipe it properly because the floor was still oily and the stain got worse because she used a wet tissue that is soapy (goes to show how selfish she is). She then went to her room without a word. In the end, I had to mop the floor again because she made it worse. I didn't call her out because it's just useless when dealing with someone selfish like that. It's like talking to a wall. If I had call her out, all she will do is get mad, play victim, and start a fight with me, which I'm not interested in because it was 10pm and also an unnecessary argument since I know I'm not in the wrong. To be honest, I'm writing this just to vent out. But what do you guys think? Am I the asshole in this situation? Edit: If you think I just hate my sister and I'm being too harsh on her. Keep in mind, the stain on the floor was literally next to the corner of our dining table, which is dangerous because anyone could've slipped and hit their head on the sharp edge of the table. Imagine losing an eye because of it. The fact that she didn't clean up the floor immediately until I told her to, goes to show how selfish she is. She literally just sat there, on her phone, while the floor was hazardous. So yeah, she really is selfish. Edit 2: The point of this post is not about her not listening to me or that she used wet tissues instead of the mop like I told her to. The point here is that she doesn't take responsibility for her own actions. If you made a mess, would you leave it or would you clean it up? Exactly. She didn't clean it up until I told her to. On top of that, she didn't even clean the floor properly, spreading the oil even more. Not only that, but she also just immediately went to her room, leaving the floor that she half-heartedly cleaned. Also, like in the first edit, it is dangerous because the floor is slippery. What if one of us slipped and hit the corner of the table? The whole point is about her taking responsibility, not about this mop vs tissue that so many are bringing up. Edit 3: Some of you are calling me the asshole. Okay, try putting yourself in my shoes. What would you do if you had just cleaned your house, and then someone, either your family or friends, just made a mess. Would you just let it go or would you tell them to take responsibility. Majority of you would go for the latter, right? Okay. Now, how would you feel after telling them to clean up their mess, only for them to play victim and clean it up half-heartedly, causing you to clean it yourself in the end? Would you be delighted or would you be somewhat mad or disappointed? Ask yourself that question and see whether you will behave differently or the same as me. Keep in mind, deep inside I was mad, but I didn't say anything. Just as written in the post, I didn't call her out or anything. I just cleaned it up myself, made this post to vent out, and moved on. Edit 4: Sure, maybe I'm the asshole for the way I'm writing this. But that's not the point. The point is about her not taking responsibilities. So please. make judgement based on the content of the story itself, not exterior stuff like the way I'm writing, me being emotional, the post is too long, etc. Final edit (hopefully): If you are wondering why a bunch of adults are living under one roof, I am Asian, and we live in Asia. It is normal for Asians to still live with their parents, unless they get married and have their own family. For single people, most of us live with our parents, even if we're 30 years old. At the end of the day, there's nothing wrong with it because it's just the culture in most Asian families, same as how it is common for Americans to live on their own once they start college. It might sound weird to you, but it's our culture, so please don't be rude about it. Besides, us adults living under one roof is not even the point of this post. I don't get why some are bringing it up when it's not even the main issue.",

        "selftext": "My partner and I live with her mom. She is very gracious in allowing us to live there so we can save money and buy a house. There is however, one complication. We have two cats, and when we moved in we asked that she gets rid of the toxic plants (she had a lot of lillies). Since we moved in two months ago, she has twice brought lillies home. Both times, we just said hey these are lillies can we move them, and she has no problem with that. Another time, she brought home a plant that was toxic, but I can't remember the name and it was shortly after she brought lillies home for the second time. A few days ago, she brought home a new plant that her friend gave her. I assumed that she had already checked the plant to see if it were toxic or not. Today, I looked it up myself and sure enough, its toxic to cats. When I approached her about the plant, I was respectful and just asked something like could you please check to see if the plants are toxic before you bring them in. Her response was saying that she felt attacked, that she didn't do anything wrong, and that because I helped unload her car, I should have seen the plant and looked it up then. (I didn't unload the plant from the car, just her heavy groceries from the trunk). We ended up getting in a heated argument. She was adamant that she did nothing wrong and that its my responsibility to look up the plants she brings in. I don't necessarily disagree, they are my cats and it is my responsibility...and I do look up all the plants she brings in. But after today being the third or fourth time she brought a toxic plant in...I just felt its not unreasonable to ask if she could look it up before hand. AITA? She does have obsessive personality disorder, so maybe her behavior has something to do with that? Or, maybe I'm just an asshole. Edit:  I should make it clear that\u2019s she is not a plant person. She only has like two plants in her house at any given time. She has one on the kitchen window sill( the one her friend gave her), and a bouquet of flowers on the kitchen island. She usually only has the flowers and changes them once a month",

        "selftext": "I (23F) have a friend (24F) who is currently in uni in another country. Her family is pretty strict so being far away from them made her go a little wild. Recently she was ranting to me about how her first kiss experience. She and her uni friends went clubbing, where she drank heavily and got drunk, but not drunk enough to fully black out, being still lucid enough to be aware of her surroundings and actions. According to her, this guy started approaching her, and they ended up grinding and eventually the guy kissed her, and it escalated into a full make out session.  The next morning she immediately regretted letting the guy do that to her and she called me for support.  While she described the story, it seemed like she wanted me to reassure her that the kiss didn\u2019t count or to sympathize with her. However, I found it hard to comfort her, or for sorry for what she experienced,  because firstly she knew her friends that went with her were going to be drinking heavily as well so there\u2019s no one looking out for her and she\u2019s going to be on her own. Secondly, she consented to the guy kissing her at that point (not saying no/pushing him/walking away) and also she kissed him back which was what caused the kiss to become a full make out session.  I knew she could\u2019ve done something because after the kiss happened the grinding continued and she began feeling uncomfortable about the guy starting to touch her inappropriately and so she walked away right away so it\u2019s not like she couldn\u2019t have done anything if she did not want him to kiss her. She just regretted giving away her first kiss to a total stranger who she doesn\u2019t even remember.  I didn\u2019t say much on the call and didn\u2019t offer the reassurance she seemed to be seeking. I felt conflicted because I think she willingly engaged in the situation and only regretted it afterward. However, I wonder if I was wrong for not being more supportive as her friend. I might be victim blaming as well for thinking that she should\u2019ve been more careful and responsible about her alcohol intake, knowing that she has no one watching out for her.  AITA? EDIT: I did not say much on the call as I was in complete shock that this happened to her. I was in no way judging her and I feel really bad that her first kiss (which is something she was looking forward to) was taken away like this. I am just wondering if I am the AH for not showing her the support that she wanted me to ie telling her it doesn\u2019t count as her first kiss. I did not tell her off or voice any of my \u201cjudgemental\u201d opinions I just listened.  EDIT 2: My friend asked me and I quote \u201cIt doesn\u2019t count right\u201d as to whether this is her first kiss experience or not I am not assuming anything.  ",

She told me she wanted a cat, I talked to her about cats, looked for cats for a few months until we all agreed on a really cute cat, and then we got a cat. Afterwhich She told my husband and I that she NEVER said she wanted the cat and didn't even like cats after we brought her home. We kept the cat back with us, and we do everything for her, so she's our cat.  Now this cat is super attached to me, she's on me when I'm sleeping or awake, she stands vigil while I use the bathroom, and shes at the door as I leave and return. My husband says it's like she looks at me as her mommy, which is cute but I don't really refer to myself as mommy. However I heard my mother in law refer to herself as mommy... while my husband is referred to as daddy to the cat.  It makes me feel a little weird. I've always felt like she has looked at me as competition, I've had to tell her before she's not married to her son I am and the way she tries to overtake my position as her sons wife gives me the ick. I have let her step on me before, trying to keep the peace, but I really don't like how it feels.  So my question basically is, if I asked her to not refer to herself as mommy with our cat would I be the asshole?  Edit. This has already been solved. Thank you everyone for your help.",

I don't mean full on faking being someone else like identity theft, but like pretending to be a different person than she actually is. She would use a name that didn't seem to make sense for her and really just did a lotta weird shit. On Monday I overheard her talking and she mentioned a name that I thought would be her mom's. I went home and looked up the name she gave plus her last name (I memorized it because we had some assignments together and I would see her last name) on Google and found her mom on Facebook. I spent all night but didn't see anything about her but after a few days of looking I found a really old photo of her and found her real name. I took screenshots and texted them to my friends, who decided to spread them around. Eventually the whole school knew her actual name and started calling her that.   A few people and teachers still called her the fake name but obviously everyone knew she was a liar atp. I got called into the office today and she was there with her parents. They reported me for harassment and said I purposely spread out her name to get people to harass her, but in reality I just wanted my friends to know the truth and they were the ones that spread it.  I was suspended and my parents grounded me for getting suspended. I also have to apologize which I don't know why since she's being a liar.

We will call the brother-in-law Billy. Billy is financially very stable. My husband John and I are not. Billy is John's half-sibling who was raised by his mother's side of the family. Billy's Mom passed away 5 years ago and left him a substantial inheritance. Billy didn't have a lot of contact with his dad's side of the family. Once his mother passed away he reached out to be closer to his dad and brother John.  John and I have known each other since 4th grade. We started dating around the 9th grade and got married last year. Billy has never liked that John and I are a couple. He feels like we should have waited to get married until we were more financially stable, finished college, and dated other people. John and I think he is projecting since he is the child of a broken home.  So Billy is constantly involving himself in our marriage. One way he does this is to stop by unannounced every day. He eats our food and tells me I am a horrible wife and a terrible woman for choosing school over being a wife and mother. He also constantly questions why we have no children yet. (Because we can barely feed ourselves and are still in school.) Anyway, you get the idea; Billy is not a nice person to us, but he is family.  The reason I may be TA is before Winter Break I was up early and desperately searching for something to eat, like I said we are starving college students. Billy knows we are struggling and does nothing to help us out, but he continues to show up for every meal. On this particular morning, I found a half jar of peanut butter and some old packages of instant oatmeal in the cabinet. Like clockwork, here comes Billy waddling in for a free meal. I was stressed, about to take my finals that day, and worried my husband and I would not have enough nourishment to get through them. So I grabbed the jar of peanut butter and dumped 2 heaping spoonfuls into the pot. Billy is allergic to peanuts and he freaks out yelling that I am trying to kill him. Now he has the whole family believing I hate him and tried to murder him on purpose. Even John is saying it would have been a rough day but it would have been easier than to deal with this backlash. AITA here? EDIT: I am adding this edit to clarify that I did not try to feed the oatmeal to Billy. I added to the pot so he couldn't have any. That probably makes me an even bigger AH. It was a moment of weakness. EDIT 2: I want to say thank you to everyone for your feedback. John and I are going to take much of the advice. This has been very hard for us and we did need to hear some of this feedback. Thank you all for helping us get over our first hurdle as a married couple. ",

I'd never say that without having been asked, and even then, I would've said something to change the subject or flat-out lie and say it's the most gorgeous engagement ring of all time. Except for the fact that I got engaged two months ago, and my fiancee got me a moonstone ring because that's my birthstone, and that's WHAT I WANTED. My cousin simply couldn't accept that and kept going on and on about how diamonds are emblematic of engagement rings and that my fiancee just cheaped out. Imagine my surprise when she posts her engagement announcement on insta and her precious diamond is almost invisible. I don't think words can describe how small it is. Whatever you're imagining, it's smaller. I congratulated her on her post and thought of leaving it at that, but she DMed asking what I thought, so I just asked if that's the size she wanted, and that turned into a full-blown dumpster fire.

She's been putting off getting a job for a few weeks (she's applied to six over the past three weeks with no response) so my husband and I decided to put our feet down. We gave her until 8:00 PM to draft us a multi-week plan regarding how she plans to get a job (e.g. how many jobs a week? which jobs? etc.) She gave us a half-assed paper that said, apply to 3 jobs a week. We told her that this was unacceptable, and told her that she wasn't even really trying to get a job. She then asked us aggressively how many jobs\u00a0*we*\u00a0thought she should apply to, and I said that she should apply to 3 a day. My daughter then said, well then how am I supposed to devise a multi week plan if I'm already going to be applying to 21 jobs a week? We said that it's still a multi-week plan, consisting of applying to a total of 42 jobs over two weeks. She got very upset at us and cried and yelled, and locked herself in her bathroom for the rest of the night. It was also her job to do dishes today, and we reminded her with a text about this, to which she refused to do them. We didn't know what to do, and are threatening her with not letting her go to her friends debutante ball and winter formal after party.  I just want her to learn to be independent and prepared with some funds before she heads off to college: Am I the asshole?",

        "selftext": "(Throwaway account) EDIT: Still responding to everyone, but seems like I am the Asshole. I accept my verdict and talk to husband about finding a better way. We have a 3 month old baby, I (30F) am on maternity leave and husband (32M) works from home. Baby is formula fed, feeds every 2-3 hours and needs to be held upright for at least 40 minutes after feeding due to reflux. So to make sure each of us get at least several hours of sleep in a row, husband and I split the night into shifts - he's in charge 19:00-01:00 and I'm from 01:00-07:00. I go to bed at 19:00. Husband usually stays in the living room until 01:00, then goes to sleep and puts baby in a crib by our bed. I on the other hand go back to bed after I'm done feeding/burping/holding because I want to try and get some sleep between feedings and this is where the issue starts. Baby would sometine get fussy between feeds, make sounds or fart loudly. If the fussing escalates or he starts crying, I get up and take him to the living room to handle it. But if I can calm him down by patting, pacifier etc., I don't leave the bed and go back to sleep. This annoys husband because just the fussing wakes him up. He asked that I stay in the living room, but I want to sleep between feeds if I can and sleep poorly on the couch. So I said he can either put ear plugs or sleep on the couch instead, I'm staying in our bed. AITA for not spending my entire shift in the living room?",

        "selftext": "Ok so I\u2019m really pissed off and disappointed at my bf of 10 years. On Thursday he had to fly from Canada to Jamaica for his grandpas funeral. He invited me to go but decided he wasn\u2019t going to bring me anymore, I was upset he didn\u2019t end up bringing me because he decided to fly with his brothers instead so whatever I had to just deal with it. We have never went on a trip outside of the country without each other so that\u2019s why it was disappointing. I even packed his suitcase and helped him convert money to Jamaican dollars and literally helped him with booking the ticket, even though again I was mad I still did it for him. He specifically told me he\u2019s not going down there for fun, said he\u2019s only there for the funeral and to mourn the death of his grandpa. Tell me why I check his location and he\u2019s at a fucking resort the day AFTER the funeral which is 4 hours away from his grandpas house? When I asked him he told me it\u2019s not a resort, he\u2019s at a hotel. LIES! I google it and it\u2019s a resort in negril, with a nice beach, pools, buffet, LOUD music. Who is he trying to fool? And yes that made me upset because again, he\u2019s there without me and I know he would be upset too if I did the same thing. And LIED about it. AGAIN, I was forced to get over it. So this is the cherry on top of why I\u2019m angry. Before he left to Jamaica, I sent him $200 Canadian dollars to cover what I asked for which was roasted breadfruit, which is hard to find here where I live. I specifically asked for 6 of them which cost less than $5 Canadian dollars. That\u2019s all I asked for. The only reason I asked for that was because I know his mom brings down so much food, she brings more than 6 roasted breadfruits, fruit, a lot of raw fish and bottles of wine and beer. So I know she had no issues going through customs. Tell me why he calls me today, I asked him what he bought me and all he bought me was 1 FUCKING BREADFRUIT. Mind you, I ASKED him and PAID for it so he can make it up to me by him excluding me on the trip. He told me he\u2019s going to have issues with customs and then called me ungrateful. I told him I only fucking asked for that and he didn\u2019t even try to make me happy considering how he excluded me and went to a fucking resort without me and tried to lie about it. Do I even have the right to be angry?? I told him he can keep it for himself and asked for my money back. AITA?Ps the reason I\u2019m so upset is because I have the biggest heart and do so much for him and spoil him and he doesn\u2019t even fucking try to reciprocate it back, I\u2019m not asking for the exact same but at least try. And he fucking didn\u2019t. ",

He has experience as a vendor at Cons and I do not. So I thought he could be my guide and help me navigate all that stuff. I also thought that our chances of actually getting a table would be better because he already had that experience.  We've applied at the end of last year and by now we have been rejected by every single convention we have applied to. With one exception. One convention didn't allow shared tables so we applied separately and then planned to ask the Con to put our tables next to each other if both of us got accepted.   Well, he got a rejection and I was accepted. It's by far the biggest Convention we applied to with the most competition for the tables. And it is his Dream Convention he always wanted to vend at.  The two of us had found 3 more Conventions we'd like to try for before I got that accepted to the big Con. But since I got that acceptance letter I am thinking that I might have better chances of getting in if I apply alone.  I knew from the get go that the products he made were of lower quality than mine but I thought his vending experience would be more important to Cons than the quality of his things (turns out, most Cons don't even ask if you have prior experience and just look at the products).  Why I would be the asshole: Breaking a promise is bad and he has talked multiple times about how he just isn't good enough and about how sad he is about all the rejections. I don't want to add insult to injury.  Why I wouldn't be the asshole: It turns out that his vending experience is limited to small Conventions. It seems like in most cases he was accepted, because all applicants were accepted. I didn't know about this before we decided to share a table. I don't think he intentionally mislead me but I would have made a different decision if I had known.   And for him art is a hobby, for me it's my job. The stakes are higher for me because my income depends on it.  Would I be the asshole if I break the promise I made to apply together and tell him that I want to apply alone?    ",

We have been dating for 1 year but until today I have NOT met his 28 year old only daughter. She has been married for 4 years now and she has a 1 year old boy. It is still uncertain as to why she has not visited or responds to my boyfriend's texts or anyone on his side of the family. He believes it is because he wants to sell the house he still owns with his ex. My boyfriend's daughter, her husband and their son and my boyfriend's ex still live in that house. They were given the option to buy him out but they all want the house to be sold to them to what it was worth back on 2013. My boyfriend he just wants a fresh start.  So last year back on November my boyfriend and I we were supposed to travel along with another couple to Cancun. My boyfriend does not have the hours and flexibility to take vacations as us 3 have. He asked to postpone the trip to March so we agreed. A few days ago while attempting to schedule the trip he told me he was not ready financially and time wise and he couldn't make the month of March either. I was upset but did not say anything. So about 1 or 2 days after this he confessed how much he misses his daughter and grandson and continued to tell me he can not believe how she takes up to 1 week to answer his texts. We continued the conversation but changed the subject a little and he told me that he still pays for his ex's car insurance (which is understandable specially since divorce it's not finalized) and for their daughter's. I WAS LIVID! I was like: Who? your daughter that is married?? (I was being sarcastic as they only have her) I asked why and he said because that is her daughter and was going to continue helping her. He continued saying he only pays $100 a month for her insurance and he spends that and more every time him and I go out to eat. My boyfriend and I we NEVER talk about money and where our money goes but I have a career where I make my own money and just about 5 months ago I bought a condo with no one's help so no, I am not after his money. We do not live together (he lives with his parents) but he does buy groceries for my house here and there but does not pay for any of my bills and NEVER gives me cash nor I expect it. He continued saying that he could not believe I was talking about his daughter and I responded that I could not believe either that after how she treats him he is doing this so what about her good for nothing husband?? Is this the reason why we are not traveling on March? After my friends and I bend backwards to accommodate him? He continued saying that he confides me his issues so I can listen but not judge So AITA? I was and I'm still livid..... ",

The original plan was for them to take him over to their house since he\u2019s about 3 months old. But Adam  didn\u2019t communicate that with his dad. And then the vet told us he had roundworm so that made it not possible for them because Mark  and Lisa\u2019s dog is old and they didn\u2019t want to risk it. When I got back, the first thing I noticed was that my puppy was in the wrong crate, he was covered in pee, and had chewed up the bed in that crate. So clearly, things weren\u2019t followed how I had asked. That already frustrated me on top of being hungover and exhausted and grieving. But I was too exhausted to deal with it at the time. My wife sent a thank-you text to Mark and Lisa but accidentally left out Adam and Sue. A little while later, Mark called me, asking about it and then straight-up asked if I was mad. The truth is, I was. because they didn\u2019t really do what I had asked. But instead of apologizing or acknowledging anything, Adam immediately shifted blame, saying it was my fault for not explaining things well enough, and got very pissed about me not saying thank you. Then Sue said I was being passive aggressive. Instead of saying something back I just told her that I\u2019d like to keep it between me and Adam because I originally asked him. I did shut her down but I didn\u2019t want her to get caught in the middle. That pissed her off royally though. Now, mutual friends are telling me I should smooth things over because Adam feels unappreciated and Sue feels disrespected. I do appreciate that they helped, but their reaction made me feel like they weren\u2019t being very understanding of what I had just gone through. AITA for not thanking them right away and for feeling put off by how they handled this? UPDATE: So I was going to Clarify on a couple things. 1. There was no neglect and that wasn't the point of the argument 2. I know I was frustrated over minor things. I would have never brought it up if it weren't for mark calling me and asking about it and pushed for an answer. 2. The reason my wife texted was because i was driving home and I fully intended on calling him personally to thank him and even joke around about my frustrations. I gave context in my post as to why I wanted to wait 3. I am appreciative of their help and I told them that when we were arguing, It did come off as not genuine. The whole thing got a lot bigger than I think needed to be and I didn't understand why. 4. I went ahead and talked to everyone and apologized for being frustrated and letting that overshadow my appreciation. Adam is still insisting that I should have just said thank you and bent the knee. The whole interaction I think is silly, but not worth being mad about. Puppies are a handful and he did a pretty good job all things considered.  5. Finally, some of y'all are out there. This was clearly a minor case of who the butthole is and coming at me saying I drank too much or that my wife carries the emotional burden is not needed. I definitely wasn't acting in the best way but I think a little grace is merited. I would really hesitate to wanna be friends with people who would kick you while your down. ",

She pays her 3rd share 600/month of the rent and she pays the entirety of the internet bill which is about 116/month. She is paid about 50k/year as a maintenance tech for apartments. About 5 nights a week she will come home with her girlfriend and play video games, if they come home early enough they partake in what I have made for dinner, otherwise they will shut themselves in the bedroom till morning. The other two nights the girlfriend stays at her place and stepdaughter comes alone, same routine though. I want to ask for her share in the power bill,  water bill, and gas. I know her argument will be that she can\u2019t afford it. She has had several car accidents and so her car insurance is high. She has a monthly car payment and she takes care of her cats. I can\u2019t think of another expense she would have.Maybe this is a no-brainer. I hate talking about money and would honestly just keep it bottled up and look the other way. But one reason I need to bring it up is that I haven\u2019t been working since July. I was laid off at the same time I found I was pregnant and decided to just coast until I had the baby to look for work. Our savings is running out and things are about to get more difficult. I\u2019m due first week of February.  Edit: ok I get it, I\u2019m the asshole. I feel like a bum and I can\u2019t wait to go back to work.

        "selftext": "Throwaway account for obvious reasons I (F30) got married a few years ago, and for my wedding, I gave my sister, **Victoria** (F28), enough tickets to invite whomever she wanted no questions asked. The only condition was that she not invite one specific person my fiance really disliked. She understood, and it wasn\u2019t an issue since, although they were friends, she respected our wishes. Now, Victoria is getting married. Weddings in our culture are a *big* deal, huge family gatherings filled with food, music, and dancing, where extended relatives, family friends, and even distant acquaintances are often invited. It\u2019s not uncommon to have hundreds of guests, and the celebration is as much about community as it is about the couple. Victoria hasn\u2019t really asked me for input on the guest list, which I understand, she already knows who she wants there. The wedding is still 9 months away, and I\u2019ve only asked her to invite **one** person. Just one. That person is **Alice**, who is incredibly important to me, like a sister. I\u2019ve known her since i was 10, and she even invited Victoria to her own wedding. However, when I brought it up, Victoria told me she hadn\u2019t invited Alice and wasn\u2019t planning to, not because she dislikes her, but because she\u2019s already over her guest limit. She told me to \u201cwait and see\u201d if there\u2019s space later. Her reasoning is that she hasn\u2019t seen Alice in years and that Alice doesn\u2019t know her fiance, so she\u2019s not on the priority list. But what frustrates me even more is that Victoria keeps saying that it shouldn\u2019t matter because she has already invited some of my friends. While that is *partially* true, the reality is that those friends are also *her* friends, she invited them because she wanted them there, not because I asked her to. I even pointed this out and said, \u201cWell, if that\u2019s the case, then how about we swap out a third friend for Alice?\u201d Her immediate response was *no,* because that person is \u201cher guest\u201d and is definitely coming. I know it\u2019s not my wedding, it\u2019s Victoria\u2019s and her fiance\u2019s decision who they invite. I completely respect that. I\u2019m not angry or trying to demand anything, I just can\u2019t help but feel a little disappointed. With so many people being invite, it stings that Alice, who is like family to me, couldn\u2019t be included. Especially when I made accommodations for Victoria at my own wedding **AITA for insisting she make room for Alice?** EDIT: Since people keep saying. Alice has been a close family friend for 20 years. She and Vic even hung out without me many times so they are not randoms. EDIT 2: Maybe using insist was the incorrect term since everyone keeps pointing that out. We only had 1 conversation about this where I said Id like to have Alice in the guest list and she said no, then we talked about it for 5 more minutes before it ended and I asked her to let me know if she changed her mind. Edit 3: I should have mentioned that we are NOT American. In our culture its very normal that parents and siblings get to invite their friends to the wedding and you are usually sat with your guests during the banquet so its not that weird that I asked about a specific friend.

        "selftext": "So I am currently ending with a B in a course where I was one singular assignment point away from an A. The point was docked on a group project where the teacher explicitly said that only one groupmate should submit the project or else everybody would be docked a point. Now I was aware that my grade was borderline so I did everything I could to assure we would get full score, running the project through the teacher until she approved it, verbally confirmed who would submit it (not me), and created a group chat for the assigned submitter to provide proof that he submitted it so the group would be at ease. And so it went exactly as planned, yet when I got my grade back I realized we had been docked a point because another group mate, who WASNT assigned to submit, had submitted the assignment too, causing me to miss the A mark by ONE single point. Frustrated, I told the teacher this situation and how  I don't deserve to be punished for the mistakes of another teammate as I had literally done EVERYTHING to assure this wouldn't happen, I mean we ALL had agreed on who would submit it so I genuinely don't get why the other student did what he did. So either way, the teacher isn't willing to budge on my end at all even though I provided all the proof I had and even have students willing to vouch. I am concerned for what to do as in the end a grade is just a grade, but I feel I am being wronged from a grade I truly deserve. I discussed with my teacher and they said the grade decision was final, would I be the asshole to continue pushing her to see this clear unfairness and to hopefully right my grade. *I understand that life isn't fair but like cmon, what could else could I have done to prevent this situation? I tried my absolute hardest and I also have other commitments in my life too, I can't be following around my groupmates all day to make sure they don't mess-up on some basic instructions. I had done this same exact process on previous group projects with no issues at all, so this is super frustrating and I don't know why the teacher isn't willing to hear me out at all.",

        "selftext": "For New Year I (29F) decided to surprise my mom by coming home on NYE, as I just had a baby, her first grandchild, and have dinner with my family. I told my sister (23) I was coming, and wanted to order some food for everyone to eat. I searched for the best price and found a menu for $89.50 for 10 people. Apparently, the minimum order for these type of menus is 10, and they give you big trays of food. I asked her to split the bill with me, and told her that they could keep the leftovers to eat that week, and in case any of our friends wanted to hang out, we would have something to offer. At first she said she was not willing to pay for more food than we needed, and that she wanted to find another option for less people or where they would sell individual plates. IMO I thought the option I found was a good offer, but agreed to let her find another option. After 3 days I asked her if she found something, but she never even looked. We were running out of time so I told her I was going to pay for it and that she could pay me her half, which she did. I told my two best friends I was arriving on the 31st and I invited them both over, and told them we would have some food. My sister also told me she invited her BF over, which was perfectly fine. Flash forward to NYE, I was traveling home and told my sister that my two friends MIGHT come hang out but was not sure, to which she answered asking if they were going to put some money for the food. I said no, we already paid for it, and there was more than enough to share. I then asked if she would ask her boyfriend to pay for his dish. She said he was not coming anymore, but if he wouldve came, she would in fact ask him for the money. She said, and I quote, why do I have to pay for your friends' food if the whole point of ordering that much was for us to keep the leftovers to eat the rest of the week. At this point I was flabbergasted & in shock of her attitude and told her I was NOT going to ask my friends (one who was picking me up at the airport on New Years Eve, and the other who even when I was not there, would visit them bringing food and baked goods to share with my family) for money; that if she was in so much need of $18 I would give it to her when I arrived. To which she answered in a voice note CRYING telling ME I was an AH, was not empathetic with her and her situation and that she was extremely sad of my lack of consideration (the vn was 3 min long but that was basically the summary). At this point I was over it and about to take off so I just didn't answer. At the end of the night, neither of my friends went to my house. Four days later they ended up THROWING THE FOOD AWAY because it was too much and by the second day my sister was sick of the same thing (my mom\u2019s words so IDK if my sister actually said this). My husband agrees that the whole thing is insane and in my opinion I think it is miserable to be fighting over food and less than $50 \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f so Reddit, am I the asshole?",

        "selftext": "Hi reddit! First of all, english is not my first language, so i apologize if something is not written correctly. So me (17 years old female) and my family (Dad [47 years old] and brother [10 years old]) went on a short trip of 1 night and 2 days last week. We went to a near town (aproximately 1 or 2 hours in car from where we live) located on the coast of a river. This is a very small town and it only has a few bars and restaurants to have lunch and dinner.  The thing is, we were at a bar, and there were two musicians playing guitar and percussion and singing, and they where playing a few requests from the crowd. At some point, my dad suggested to my brother that he could ask the musicians to play a song from a band that my brother loves. My brother didn't know if he wanted to tell the musicians to play a song, so my dad went to ask them. When he came back, my dad said (and i don't know if this is true or if my dad just said it to cheer my brother up) that the musicians told him that they didn't know the lyrics of the songs of this band, and that my brother would have to sing (my brother said that he would sing if he had to).  The thing is, this band is well known in the country where i live, however is more like a niche band, even though it is known. The thing is that musicians were playing (and the crowd were asking) for popular songs that everyone knows, so i thought that it could clash with the atmosphere. And my brother doesn't sing very well. So at some point i told my brother that no one wants to hear him sing, and i told him to not sing. My dad told me that i shouldn't say that, and after that my brother said that he was agree with me and that he doesn't sing very well.  He didn't sing after all, but i was wondering if i went to far when i told my brother that. It's just that it would have been so cringe if he had sung, but if that happened, i could have easily left the bar and go to the hotel (to 200 meters of the bar), because as i said, is a small town. My brother doesn't seem affected for what i said, but i thought that maybe i owe him an apology, AITA?   EDIT: Thanks for your comments! I've been reading every single one of them, i apreciate your opinions. Special thanks for those who shared their opinions respectfully.  I accept the judgment; i was an asshole in this situation, i said something hurtful and unnecesary that i should have kept to myself. I will apologize with my brother, and i will make breakfast for him tomorrow (i usually don't make him breakfast) with the foods that he likes as an apology. Again, thanks to everyone for sharing your thoughts here. That said, i will uninstall reddit for my own mental health. Some comments were really rude and i don't feel comfortable here anymore, so im going to prioritize my mental health, because i realized that im not prepared to dealing with some of the comments. I were nice to everyone who i answered, so i just will keep wishing everybody a lovely day \u2661 Again, thanks for everything.",

        "selftext": "My girlfriend hates receiving gifts. She says it \u201cmakes her feel weird\u201d. She\u2019s absolutely fine with receiving money, but no objects.  I have recently developed a very strong passion for knitting, and of course im always getting comments from others (family, friends, strangers, etc.) about \u201cooh could you make meeeee something???\u201d And honestly? I don\u2019t want to. It takes a lot of time and effort to hand knit something, and I don\u2019t really want to give that away to just anyone. I\u2019ve seen so many posts and videos of knitters making gifts out of sweaters, hats, socks, anything that you can make, it\u2019s been a gift. Everyone that they have made it for has always loved it, and they express feeling proud looking at their knitting on the people they love.  I\u2019ve asked my girlfriend multiple times if I could make her something. She\u2019s always said no. Most of these conversations have been short, and we\u2019ve moved on afterwards. Last night it kind of came to a head though, and I was feeling really unappreciated when she said \u2018no\u2019 again. I really tried convincing her. I told her the effort and money really wasn\u2019t a problem for me, and she said that\u2019s not why. I told her that her refusal of letting me make her something really hurt my feelings, (and it was at this point in the conversation where I was holding back tears over it. I cry really easy while off my meds, and I have been for a month or so not by choice.)  She still kept saying no, and tried to change the topic so I would stop crying, but I held firm. I wanted to make her something, and I really hated that she didn\u2019t want anything I made. she asked why this really upset me so much. Through tears I ended up explaining my reasoning above, seeing others able to knit for their partners and have them love it. She went quiet for a bit and then said she will think about it. I was better with that answer and I let it go. we drifted off topic, and a few hours later she told me no again. I told her it was okay, but I was crushed. We didn\u2019t talk again that night, and now I\u2019ve woken up and been thinking about it all morning (yes I did cry a little too.) I just need to know, am I overreacting? Or is what im feeling genuine and basically do I even have a right to be upset over this.  Added context: we\u2019re both still in/around late teens, she is in college and im a high school dropout living with my parents. (Working on a diploma). The problem she seems to have is in accepting gifts, and also in the fact that for this gift she would have to measure herself and give me an address to send it to. I think it may make her feel strange to be so active in a gift, but if I make her something I want it to be something she will use. Also, online relationship. No weird age gap shit. Edit to add: yes I know this is really my girlfriend we have been dating for several years online, im not being taken advantage of. I know her general stature, measurements are just so they fit. I got the point that im probably the asshole, so im going to delete my throwaway now. Thank you for all the helpful comments.",

For the past year, we\u2019ve been renting his Nana\u2019s house from her. She hadn\u2019t lived here in some time and the taxes/utilities were putting her in a financial hole. We pay her 1k per month, which according to her is more than enough. She considers this a favor, and so do we (because it\u2019s a steal).  I admit I do sometimes feel like a visitor. MIL always refers to it as \u201cBF\u2019s house\u201d, not ours. I\u2019m never in the loop about things, like when someone in his family will stop by (which isn\u2019t that often, but BF is always the point of contact). I\u2019m just\u2026 very aware that I may live here, but it\u2019s not my space. The problem at hand is regarding the temperature in the house. I am a very cold person, BF is a very warm person. So naturally we bicker about the AC/heat setting, but never anything like this.  We\u2019ve been sleeping with it on 70, which is fine. Last night I got off late (I work evenings) and saw he had turned it down to 68. I left it because I figured he was hot, but I texted him (he was asleep) and asked if he\u2019d click it up to 71 before he left for work. I sleep for about 2-2.5 hours after he leaves and get freezing in the bed alone.  I woke up this morning, freezing, to find that it was still on 68. I thought maybe he forgot, but no. When I texted him about it, he accused me of \u201ctaking advantage of our living situation\u201d by \u201cusing the heat however I want\u201d. He said he was sick of it being hot in the house and called me \u201cungrateful\u201d (??).  Let me say right now that the highest I will *ever* put the heat on is 73, and that\u2019s pushing it. Yesterday I put it on 72 at one point, which he bitched about and then turned it down. So maybe this was just fresh or something? I don\u2019t know, but I don\u2019t \u201ctake advantage\u201d of shit. *I\u2019m just cold*.  I\u2019ll also add that this past summer (which had triple degree temps), we slept with the AC on 67-68 every night because *he* gets hot. We\u2019re facing a freaking winter storm right now and the temperature is in the TEENS. I can\u2019t believe he would say this to me. I\u2019d love to know if I\u2019m TA here because I am considering moving out over this. Please put me in check if so. AITA?",

        "selftext": "My gf (23F) recently mentioned to me (23M) that she wants to have a night out with her friend from school. I asked her what the plan was and if she wanted me to go too. She said it was implied that I was invited but that it is more of a girls night. I asked who she was going with and it was her friend who she has told me some stories about. The stories were basically that every time they went out together this friend would get super drunk, try to get w dudes every time and would leave my gf alone for most of the night. Now idc that a single girl is going out and doing her thing, we\u2019re young and she\u2019s allowed to put herself out there ofc. But how am I supposed to feel comfortable with my gf going out w her after hearing all this? I do trust her, understand that they are not the same person and don\u2019t think she would cheat on me or anything like that. But how could I not be thinking she might end up in a shitty situation where she\u2019s alone in a college bar and I can\u2019t do anything about it? They\u2019d also be going out about an hour away from us. My gf would be driving and I told her honestly if she went out near us at least I could pick them up and that would make me feel way more comfortable. But this girl is still in school so she\u2019d go see her at a bar near the college which is another problem cause why would you drink and drive? She said she wouldn\u2019t drink that much but still. I told her I\u2019d like to go so I can meet her and get the chance to see what she\u2019s like for myself. That way if she\u2019s cool then i wouldn\u2019t care if they went out together because i\u2019d know her better at least. My gf said she\u2019d feel fine if i went out w my friends, but the difference is we don\u2019t go out really ever like that, they\u2019re all in serious relationships and she\u2019s met all 3 of them. She then said she\u2019s not going and it\u2019s fine, but clearly was upset and was making it obvious. I just don\u2019t want to be controlling and feel like i\u2019m holding her back from hanging out w her friends, especially cause she\u2019s been going through it recently in her personal life. But this does makes me uncomfortable, what should I do?",

        "selftext": "Hi, I (M26) have lived with my gf (F25) for the past three years. I had to discover in the hard way that we have different standards as to what counts as an \u2018empty\u2019 toothpaste. This is what happened. I went to brush my teeth before bed, when I saw that the toothpaste is empty. Meaning, I couldn\u2019t squeeze out any more paste on my toothbrush (and I try pretty hard, I squeeze it and twist it and stuff). So, I just threw the pack out and went to sleep. I don\u2019t remember the chronology of events exactly but I must have emptied the trash before sleep as well, because the toothpaste was \u2018unsalvegable\u2019 according to my gf. Anyway, she burst into the room super angry, asking where the tooth paste went. I say it is in the trash because it was empty. She then calls me a \u2018cancer-whore\u2019 (it was in Dutch, but I understood). She says: \u201chow could you do that when we have no replacement?\u201d, \u201cI have to go to work tomorrow and I won\u2019t have clean teeth\u201d, etc. She works as a teacher and is conscious of her breath.  Here you need to know something about her - she likes to shop for necessities (rice, pasta, toothpaste, tomato cans, etc) in bulk when they\u2019re on sale, so we often have a stash of this stuff in the attic. It\u2019s a nice thing that she does that of course, but it has conditioned me to not check for these things because I just assume we have some in the attic. Anyway, I must have thrown it out, realized there is no replacement in the attic, and then shrugged and went to sleep. I\u2019m thinking: \u201cwhat can you do, right?\u201d During our argument, I find out that she would have cut the toothpaste tube in half with scissors and carved out any paste inside that way. To me, this is a different standard, and maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m a guy, but I don\u2019t see the big deal in brushing your teeth with just water for one evening and one morning.  She brings up that the same thing happened with her face wash a year ago. She had cut it in half before, and I threw it out because it looked broken to me. It had resulted in a similar fight back then. I guess I had forgotten about that, but I do try to pay attention to that kind of stuff. So, long story short, is she overreacting, or am I being ignorant of her needs?  ",

I\u2019ll triple check the post before posting but you never know with these things. For safety reasons I\u2019m also going to change any names so that no one can guess as to who I may be talking about. I just really want to get some insight into what happened recently with a friend of mine, and see if I\u2019m really in the wrong here. But I (28NB) recently moved across the country for the first time in my life. I quit my \u201ccareer\u201d job, packed all of my belongings up, and shoved as much as I could in my car and drove over 800 miles to a new destination I had only visited for a week a few months prior (and fell in love with). I was living with my parents (technically my Great Aunt (72F) and Uncle(74M), but for this we\u2019ll just say my parents) and looking for a place to move out to anyways, and it was time for a change in scenery.  Anyways, the only thing I wasn\u2019t able to grab before I left for this life changing trip was my medication. I\u2019m very fortunate that I don\u2019t have to take anything SUPER serious (no controlled substances), but the meds I DO take tend to have serious side effects if you just stop taking them. Well, since I quit my job, my insurance stopped at some point. Also, of course, my last batch of meds were ready the day after I packed up my car and drove halfway across the states. Before that point, I asked my friend - we\u2019ll call her Janet(30F) - to pick up my them up for me if she could and send them my way.  She did, and then proceeded to hold onto them for a month and a half. In fact, I was under the impression she picked up ALL of my meds - because I had put in an order for all of my meds - but she didn\u2019t even check to let me know. I had to constantly text and remind her to send them my way because I was slowly running out of my medication and getting closer and closer to having to start withdrawing from them\u2026which I never want to do without the help of a PCP or psych by my side (which I didn\u2019t have at the moment because I JUST moved to a new area and lost my insurance). By the end of the month and a half, I had to get another friend to send them for me (who did it immediately without any trouble).  Something I didn\u2019t realize is that technically sending medication in the mail is frowned upon, according to google, at least. And as Janet so kindly reminded me, after a month and a half, she worked at UPS and let me know that they had constant drug dogs checking packages and scanners for the boxes to run through. But my boyfriend told me he had his meds shipped by his mom for years before across state lines without issues, and another friend of ours\u2019 dad actually worked at USPS and he himself would ship out their meds pretty regularly for years as well. So if Janet just didn\u2019t put a return address and didn\u2019t mention what was being shipped, what was the big issue?  Am I going crazy? Am I the asshole here? Am I just a doormat?",

Stephanie said it's ok if he has to come but it's not a party for kids.  Hannah called me very upset that her son isn't wanted at the party, so I called Stephanie and told her she's being rude, needs to respect her family more, needs to apologize to Hannah, and should be happy Mikey is coming. She told me that this was between her and Hannah and that I should stay out of it. I said that I'm planning the party, so I don't have to stay out of it (I stayed out of it when Stephanie didn't invite all of her aunts/uncles to her wedding but I'm not staying out of this).

I still made him go to school because I said it was his fault and it ended up hurting him real bad which I did feel really guilty for afterwards, my wife berating me a ton for the action and my youngest, would refuse to listen to anything I say (he\u2019s a mamas boy) and when my wife was away I could NOT get him to do anything at all, I told him like chores etc, he was slouching on the TV, and so I cast my phone onto the tv, knowing he is afraid of the Michael Jackson thriller music video and then held the door shut, my wife saying I was extremely out of touch for such a punishment? AITA? Update: welll the general consensus is I am a asshole but as I reflect I see what my actions may have caused.

He\u2019s a very old school conservative type guy and it\u2019s affected our relationship over the years due to him constantly brining up politics knowing we  disagree. I won\u2019t get too into it, our relationship needs a whole post of its own.  Last summer we made a trip to see him so his side of the family could meet my niece  (2 and adorable) We can call her L for the sake of this story. L has always preferred women, to the point where she\u2019s usually very uncomfortable around new men. She looooves me now (Def favorite uncle) but getting to this point took a lot of hard work, patience, and stick on tattoos. I never took her uncomfort around men personally but my dad did.  He usually calls us to check in once a week but lately I\u2019ve noticed he refers to L as \u201cthe baby\u201d when we talk about her. I know him, and I know that man has just fully forgotten his granddaughters name. L however didn\u2019t forget his name. How do I know you ask?

But I don\u2019t really like him\u201d I don\u2019t think this is a case of him getting old and losing his memory, because he can still bring up older memories and names of his friends he hasn\u2019t seen in decades.  My plan is next time he says \u201cthe baby\u201d I\u2019m gonna say \u201cThe baby? You mean\u2026\u201d and give him a name that is maybe 2 or 3 letters off Ls name, but rhymes.

        "selftext": "My BIL (28M) used to live with his parents, paying \u00a330 a week for rent and food. About 18 months ago, he started spending more time at our place after his parents\u2019 dog turned on him. I offered him to move in with us so he could save enough to move out. My husband wasn\u2019t thrilled about the idea, but I thought it would only be for a few months. EDIT we made the decision together, i didn't go against my husband's wishes we didn\u2019t have a spare room, so set him up in our 11y/o son\u2019s room with a foldout bed. We agreed on \u00a3160 a month, which covered bills/food. However he quickly started complaining about doing the dishes (only chore we asked him to do) and spent his money on nights out and other stuff instead of saving to move out. After a few months, it was clear he wasn't saving at all. When brought up, my husband said BIL had until March to move out, he was shocked by the deadline. We offered until end of August, with rent increased to \u00a3250 a month, which he agreed to. But he would consistently ignore basic requests: keeping the bathroom window open when showering to avoid mould, picking up his dirty clothes, keeping his stuff in our son's room organised and not sleeping in the living room overnight, we spend 80% of our time in that room, it's a family room NOT a bedroom. By august, BIL is no closer to moving out which i KNEW would happen. Instead, he booked a holiday, started saving for that, showing he can save and taking us for complete mugs. Rent went to \u00a3400 a month, hoping that would encourage him to leave because we can't just throw him out. He viewed a place, it fell through, and he blamed his friend- told us WE should be having a go at his friend instead as if WE'RE responsible for him. He\u2019s now been living with us nearly 18 months, paying low rent considering everything is included (even toiletries as he has not bought any since moving in). He works full-time and makes above minimum wage. I no longer like being around him, i find him rude, entitled and arrogant. The tension has caused strain between me and my husband, I\u2019ve tried to talk to him about it (A LOT), but he doesn\u2019t want to aggravate the situation, even though he agrees with me. I\u2019m frustrated because every time i broach the subject i feel dismissed and i just need to put up with it until he moves out, even if it means letting BIL act/talk to me in a disrespectful manner. My husband isn't afraid of confrontation but can't be bothered with it as we're stuck with him in house. As he doesn't back me up BIL doesn't take me seriously and i feel like I\u2019m not being supported in my own home. He's had enough of me going on about it, I've had enough of dealing with the whole thing. BIL is due to move out in 4 weeks-he's moving into his friend's (+ friends gf and 4 kids) attic as he never looked for anywhere, the whole situation has left me emotionally drained. I\u2019m wondering if I\u2019m overreacting or if my feelings are justified. Our friends agree BIL is miserable to be around and I\u2019m tired of the cr*p i'm putting up with, should i continue to let it go over my head?",

        "selftext": "My (26F) parents own the 2-bedroom condo I live in, and my boyfriend (28M) moved in a few months ago. We discussed rent beforehand, and he was fine with paying. I initially told him $1800,  in addition to splitting utilities 50/50. He agreed. For context, comparable 2-bedroom condos in our area (a desirable part of Southern California) rent for around $2800, meaning $1400 per person. My parents aren't charging *me* rent, which is incredibly generous. However, they see the condo as an investment property, and the rent they would charge me is factored into their financial planning. I send them a portion of the rent I collect every month. I also pay the HOA dues and property taxes (which are substantial in California). Everything was fine for a few months. Then, my boyfriend was looking at rental listings and realized that *individual* rooms in comparable condos are going for around $1400. He also found out (from me, I wasn't hiding it) that I technically don't pay rent myself since my parents own the place. He completely flipped out. He accused me of trying to profit off him, saying I'm taking advantage of him because I'm not paying rent. He argues that since I don't have a rent payment, the $1800 is mostly profit for me. He thinks he should only pay half of what *I* pay in combined HOA dues, property taxes and utilities. I admitted that the $1800 wasn't just based on splitting a theoretical $2800 rent. I told him I added a bit extra because I'm the one paying the HOA fees and property taxes, and I\u2019ve been responsible for general upkeep of the place. I also have to send a portion of the rent money to my parents. I acknowledged that it's more than half of what a comparable room would cost. He's not having it. He keeps saying I'm ripping him off and that I should only charge him half the combined HOA, taxes, and utilities. He\u2019s now refusing to pay the agreed-upon $1800 and is only offering what he calculates as his share of the combined HOA, taxes, and utilities. I feel like I'm being reasonable. I'm not trying to get rich off him. I'm just trying to cover the actual expenses associated with the condo. Am I the asshole here? Should I just lower the rent to appease him, even though I feel like I'm not doing anything wrong? This is making things incredibly awkward. EDIT: There is no mortgage. My parents bought the place cash as investment property. I have been living here rent free for about 8 years and have done some remodeling at the time, and have had friends as roommates here and there whom i also charged rent, but usually those cases were when those friends were suffering financially so they paid under market value.  My parents did not ask me to charge my boyfriend rent or for me to send them money, they basically say it's my choice to use the place as I want for now.  I send them 1k a month because technically it is their place and so I feel they should get a share of the rent. EDIT - UPDATE   For everyone assuming/asking if I am pocketing the money. NO I AM NOT.  It;s like this:  I send 1k to my parents since it's their place, and every time I've had a roommate I've sent them a portion of the rent without them having to ask. BECAUSE they bought this place as an investment property. I was originally going to fic it up and rent it out but stayed longer than I planned and they have never charged me rent. So I am holding them back from it being a full time rental property so of my own initiative I am sending them rent whenever I have roommates before they can ask me for it.  1k to parents $500 - HOA dues  $100-150/mo utilities Property taxes - somwehere between 5-10k/year So I'm usually left with $150-200 every month after paying my parents and HOA and utilities, and even combined over a year it would still not cover even half the property taxes, which I am willing to keep covering fully myself.   I am not pocketing anything or making any money from what I charge my boyfriend for rent. ",

I tried to get up quick and shoot out ahead of people but had a guy stand up and block me very purposefully saying he also had a flight, then proceeded to stand there and willingly let the isle fill up to let everyone in front of him go ahead even though half the isle was empty in front of him at the beginning. He didn\u2019t even move to grab his stuff. I stayed quiet. I was unhappy and frustrated but didn\u2019t say anything. Didn\u2019t even glare. I frowned, cause that was a dick move. But I just bounced anxiously hoping things went quick.  Another passenger sitting in a row near me got my attention and said, \u201chey, we\u2019re all late for our connecting flights so maybe be respectful.\u201d  \u2026. \ud83d\ude21I frowned and took a breath. I looked at him and said very politely, \u201cI am being respectful. I\u2019m not yelling or cursing or asking people to move. I\u2019m not screaming or whining that I\u2019m gonna miss my flight. Nor am I giving anyone dirty looks. I\u2019m standing here being as patient as possible because I understand that.\u201d  Which believe me was a feat considering I had barely just taken my anxiety pills for the day, not that they needed to know that. \ud83d\ude12 It felt like I was being chastised by a stranger for being anxious and showing a modicum of emotion. I was quiet, obviously annoyed but not directing it towards anyone or anything. I don\u2019t think I was being disrespectful. Yes I was trying to jump ahead because my next flight was supposed to be boarding. Was it rude to try and get off before others who had time between their flights? Was it disrespectful simply because I was the last row in the plane and should wait seated for everyone else to off board and potentially miss my flight because others weren\u2019t moving without a sense of urgency? Or was it the emotional distress I was showing that was disrespectful part? AITA?  If so I humbly accept the title, but if I am, why so I can understand. If I should wait patiently in my seat I can do that.  EDIT: I will accept that I am the AH. Thank you. I will stay seated next time and let the flight attendants know about my tight connecting flight. I really didn\u2019t know I could/should do that. I do know I was not the only person with connecting flights that may be tight and I should have realized that. I will do better next time thank you.",

        "selftext": "Me (24F) and Alex (29M) met a few years ago and he quickly became one of my best friends. He admitted early on in our friendship that his girlfriend Emma was worried about me flirting with him. I told Alex I was a lesbian and that my interest in him was 100% platonic. That seemed to settle the issue. As time went on, though, I could tell Emma and I would not become friends. Alex and I get along because we both have a very extroverted and dynamic personality and like to try new things all the time, whereas Emma is super introverted. Because of this, she's never really integrated our friend group and doesn't attend any of our outings, but Alex assured me they're both fine with this dynamic. A few weeks ago, our friend group decided to rent an Airbnb for a week-end out of town. Emma was offered to join but declined. The plan was that the couples would share beds and those of us who didn't come with our partners would each have our own bed/couch. When we arrived though, it became clear that some of us would sleep very uncomfortably as the couches were super small and hard. I proposed that those of us who came alone share beds so that no one would have to sleep on these couches. Everyone was on board and it was agreed that Alex and I would sleep in the same bed. I made sure to ask Alex if Emma would be ok with it, and he said yes. It didn't feel awkward at all, we were multiple people sleeping in one room, so it just felt like a fun sleepover. A couple of days later, though, Alex sent me a long message saying Emma was upset, because she still couldn't believe I didn't have feelings for him. This had caused a huge argument between them and she'd asked him not to talk to me anymore. He told me that he needed some space to figure things out. I'm extremely conflicted about this, because  I understand how Emma feels - she's been cheated on in her last relationship, and Alex and I have a very strong bond. We hang out very often, and are both comfortable showing our affection by hugging each other and saying I love you. I understand that this can seem odd to some people, but it works for us, and that's how most of my friendships go. On the other hand, I'm really upset that my sexuality keeps being questioned. I've stated from the very beginning that I was a lesbian, the love I feel for my guy friends is completely platonic. Alex has also made it super clear with me that he'd never thought of me that way and he's never done or said anything that made me doubt this statement in the 3+ years that we've been friends. He treats me like a younger sister and I trust him 100%. This may be delusional of me, but I don't want to go though life holding back because of social norms when me and my friends know exactly what we mean to each other. I don't really care if strangers interpret my intense love for the people around me as more than what it is, but I also don't want to hurt anyone. Was I an asshole for offering we share a bed when I knew his girlfriend was already a bit insecure about our relationship?  _________________________________________________________________________________________ EDIT - some precisions about our whole situation: - Alex and Emma do not live together. They'd been dating for six months when we met. - There were two other guys Alex could have shared a bed with. These two guys are straight and also have girlfriends. It was agreed Alex and I would sleep together because we're closer than I am to these other guys. - I don't know if Alex texted Emma to ask her about sharing a bed with me in the moment, or if he just assumed she would be fine. - I do have a girlfriend. My girlfriend has shared a bed with straight women and men in similar scenarios and that has not bothered me - we trust each other.",

Sorry in advance if there is any spelling mistakes and punctuation errors, I\u2019m typing this fast as my wife is getting our daughter ready for bed. So I Adam (19M) is married to Keeley (19F) and between us we have a little girl Iris (3F) turning 4 in a few weeks. Keeley and I got married last year after being together for 6 almost 7 years - we got together at 13 and we have been friends since the age of 10 . During our entire friendship and beginning of our relationship Keeley had no minim/ non existent relationship with her dad - he pretty much abandoned her and her siblings and from what she\u2019s told me over the years, he was an absent father throughout her entire childhood. Keeley\u2019s mum met her step dad when Keeley was around 6, and from then on her dad became even more absent and when he would have her and the siblings, she would be the one looking after everyone when only being the middle child. During last year\u2019s wedding preparations Keeley\u2019s dad wanted to walk her down the aisle on her wedding day. I didn\u2019t see the problem with that but Keeley was set in her ways and told me and her entire extended family that her step dad was going to walk her down the aisle and if anyone had a problem with it they would have been uninvited to the wedding. Fast forward to now, I\u2019ve been meeting with her dad, we will call him Ben (46M) every couple of weeks to catch up and update him on how iris and Keeley is getting along ( iris is in nursing and Keeley is going to uni in September to be a nurse). This week when I met up with Ben he expressed a desire to get to know his granddaughter as he said \u201che doesn\u2019t know how long he\u2019s got left) let me preface this by saying Ben has tried to use this tactic over the last to get Keeley to talk to him and as Keeley told me he used this as an excuse when she was kid, when she wouldn\u2019t do something he wanted.. but I don\u2019t know if he is being honest or if he is actually gonna die soon. I guess I want Keeley to talk to her dad, as I didn\u2019t have a dad growing up, my dad died when I was 9 years old - that\u2019s the reason we moved and then that\u2019s when I met Keeley. He wants me to bring iris to our meet ups or ask Keeley to hear him out. After the conversation I went to my mums house to ask for advice and she said i definitely shouldn\u2019t bring up this up to keeley and to stop meeting up with ben. I\u2019m considering just telling keeley everything and dealing with the fall out afterwards.So Reddit, Would I be the asshole if I asked my wife to talk to her dad? I don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t think of this but this is the only relationship I\u2019ve ever been in and I\u2019m actually super close to her step dad.  Edit - hello everyone! I just want to say thank you for all the comments and messages I\u2019ve received. Firstly, I wanna address people this story and account fake - I can assure you it is not, this is my real life and the account is a burner account as I do have a normal Reddit account and I have done since I was 15 Keeley just follows that one so I had to make a new one to address this matter. Secondly, people saying my story doesn\u2019t match up with our ages, we had our daughter at 16, which is almost 4 years ago, I turn 20 on the 16th January and then iris turns 4 on the 25 of February and then the following month Keeley turns 20. Keeley is starting uni in September as she took some time out of education to be 100% present for iris first 9 months that\u2019s the reason she is going. Also when I say iris is in nursery, I mean it\u2019s like a play group thing she goes to everyday, my mother in law takes her for a few hours while I\u2019m at work and my wife is at college. I just also wanna preface this by saying No, iris was never planned, we never planned to have kids till at least our twenty\u2019s, but when we found out Keeley was pregnant we had a long talk and decided that we both could do it and she\u2019s an amazing mum. In the last 3 years Ben has had nothing to do with Iris - as some messages were saying - and it wasn\u2019t due to my wife\u2019s lack of trying, he didn\u2019t want have that relationship with her. Lastly, after reading through all you\u2019re comments I can clearly tell I\u2019m a huge arsehole, Keeley has no idea I\u2019ve been meeting with her father and as some of you have said it\u2019s a huge breach of trust which is completely is. A lot of you are saying that he is using the situation with my dad against me and I never thought of this until it was mentioned. When thinking back to our meetings I can definitely say this is the case, him bringing up how, he thinks that my relationship with my dad would be now or how my own fathers relationship with my daughter would be. The people saying that this is a reason for Keeley to leave/ divorce me is a bit far fetch, Keeley is an understanding woman and she would never do something like that unless it was absolutely necessary. I\u2019m writing this on the way to wok. Tonight when I get him I\u2019m gonna to show Keeley this post, comments and all the messages I\u2019ve received and we shall go from there. I wanna say thank you to everyone who took the time to read this post, even tho I\u2019m a hide asshole. ",

        "selftext": "I (21F) have been slowly pulling away from my mom as her obsession with rocks accelerates. When I was a kid, she would grab a couple rocks every time that we would go outside, either on a walk, or at the beach, or when we were at the park. As a kid, I didn't see anything wrong with it. I grabbed random stuff off the ground too and she always encouraged my curiosity. So when I saw her pick up some rocks, I'd bring a stick home. It even got to a point that my stockings as a kid contained rocks. Now I know it's not coal, but in a house full of rocks, I didn't want any for Christmas. When we'd get home, she'd wash them thoroughly and would put it somewhere in the house. Now these weren't big boulders or anything. I think the biggest one I'd see her bring home would fit in the palms of her hands? But for over 21 years, rocks have consumed our home. It wasn't until I started to become a teenager that I noticed how disruptive this became to both her life and mine. Our walks would stop every 5 minutes for her to dig in the dirt looking for a rock. She'd have me start carrying some of them for her. And with 21+ years of collection, they're everywhere. All over our tables, the mantle, the countertops, on the toilet, ROCKS. One time, I had a friend over and when we walked in the door, she was elbows deep in the sink washing rocks. I have never been more embarrassed in my life. And I never brought anyone home since, not even any boyfriends I've had. Now that I'm in college, I find myself finding any excuse to not go home. I've tried telling her that maybe she has enough rocks and should stop but she say that the rocks just speak to her. I didn't go home for the holidays and she's been constantly texting me asking why I haven't been home and that she's so lonely that I'm not around. This resentment has been slowly building my whole life and so I blurted out Those rocks are your friends. They're the reason that you have no friends and are alone all the damn time because nobody wants to be around a person like that. She started crying and hung up. I think she needs a reality check but my roommate overheard and thinks that I was harsh and that she's my mom. AITA for telling my mom that her obsession is why she has no friends?",

        "selftext": "I 40f and my husband 42m have two wonderful kids 10m and 7f.  Our kids have never been the best of friends or even got along that well most the time, they would bicker and argue with each other call each other names and do things they knew annoyed the other to purposefully get under their skin.  I don't want to go in to detail but we've had some financial issues lately that caused a bit of a strain on our marriage, we would argue a lot late at night when the kids were in bed and often wouldn't go to bed ourselves until 2 or 3 :am ( even when we had work the next day).  I'm ashamed to say that it turns out our kids would often wake up and hear our late night arguments and this actually gave our daughter nightmares, I found this out when I went to wake my son and saw his sister in bed with him, that's when he told me she had a nightmare and got in bed with him because my husband and were still up fighting.  This broke my heart to know we made our daughter scared and weren't  there to comfort her,  we made sure to keep our arguments as quiet as possible and reasured our daughter that sometimes mommy and daddy fight but she didn't need to worry about that and everything would be okay.  We kept our arguments to a minimum and were as quiet as possible, but our daughter still had nightmares the next few nights and got in bed with her brother.  We were able to get a handle on our financial issues and stop fighting so much. We reassured the kids that  everything would be okay and that they didn't have to worry. After a few nights our daughter was back to sleeping in her owne bed.  Ever since then our kids have gotten much closer, they play together, watch shows together, goof around together, and treat each other with much more love and respect then they used to. They even hug each other goodnight every night.  They still have arguments and bicker but it's much less and they  have an overall very loving relationship.  Today my daughter drew her brother a picture of the two of them playing in our yard with the words  best big brother in the world written really big on top.  My son loved it and showed it to us and asked if we could have it framed, as I mentioned we have been having financial issues lately and I really don't think we could afford to frame it.  I told him he didn't need to frame it, he could just hang it up on the wall. But he said he wanted to frame it because special pictures get framed and this is the most special picture he has. I tried to tell him gently that we can't afford to frame it but he and his sister are still upset.  I asked my husband about it and he said maybe we should get it framed because it's so special to our son and there new found closeness could maybe be hurt by us refusing to frame it.  The last thing I want to do is hurt there new close relationship but I still don't think we can afford to get it framed.  AITA? Edit: We went to Walmart and got our son a frame for his sister's picture, we put it up on his wall right across from where his bed is and he absolutely loves it!  We're very glad his relationship with his sister is so much better and seeing her picture for him everyday means so much to him. We're so glad we were able to get a frame for him.  Some of you seemed to get the idea we were just cheap or that we just didn't want to spend money on the kids, that's absolutely not the case. The kids have lots of toys, their owne bikes and phones and of course all the essentials.  My husband and i didn't realize that there were options for cheap picture frames but we were delighted to find out there were.  Thank you all! ",

        "selftext": "Yes hi hello, so I\u2019m 21f and he\u2019s a 23m, been together for 2 years moved in together August 2023, and 2024 was a nightmare for us, so much so that we\u2019re in couples therapy. I wanted him to go to individual therapy, but he said I have issues too but I can\u2019t afford therapy for myself, which is why we\u2019re in couples. I don\u2019t like it only because I feel like we\u2019d be better if we individually got therapy but he\u2019s insisting couples and he\u2019s paying for it. That\u2019s a little background, here\u2019s the issue: This morning I was trying to do my school work as quietly as possible to not disturb him- let\u2019s call him C for now- and all of a sudden C yelled at me \u201cHow\u2019s laundry coming up?\u201d Now I say \u201cyell\u201d loosely, it was mostly his tone that caught me off guard. I thought at first he was joking around and I replied \u201cfine, how\u2019s the stove coming?\u201d Cause C hasn\u2019t cleaned the stove in a month and a half and I hadn\u2019t put up my laundry from last night so I thought we were being funny. We weren\u2019t. He started saying \u201cit\u2019ll get done when I f*cking get up, get in here and do your laundry else it\u2019ll be in the basket for 17 f*cking days.\u201d I was at this point really upset but part of couples therapy is not saying anything mean to each other and i had nothing nice to say so I started doing laundry in the room, on the bed. Thinking C was now wide awake and gonna get up, i just threw shirts at the end of the bed by his foot just to get started, and C immediately got upset again and said \u201cThe f*ck are you doing? Obviously you\u2019re gonna wake me up if you do laundry on top of me go do it in the living room we have a couch.\u201d And waved me off.  3 hours went by and C finally got up and started asking why I did that, why I was doing an idiot move, if it was me trying to force him up or say \u201cf*ck you\u201d to him and I was already upset cause the way he talked to me previously made me feel like an idiot and all these emotions bubbled over and I screamed at him \u201cI wasn\u2019t trying to do anything I was just trying to do the laundry like you said! I don\u2019t care!\u201d  C then got mad and told me to go into another room for ten minutes to calm down and I\u2019ve been in this room crying hysterically because I just feel like I\u2019m going crazy, am I the asshole here? Am I really just so deranged I don\u2019t see what I did wrong? Please give honest answers I just really need someone outside of this to tell me what I did or didn\u2019t do. ",

        "selftext": "We have a lot of kids age 14 down to age 2 with another baby on the way. Everyone age 4 and up has assigned chores throughout the day but the biggest portion of them happen after school from 4-5pm but it takes a ton of effort to keep them on task. Example of the expectations is for the 14 year old: pick up dog poop in the backyard, fold & put away his laundry, clean his room (that it shared with 2 younger brothers & they all need to help), brush his dog, and collect trash from the main level once a week. I ask each kid to pitch in on what they can handle for their age & then try to hold them accountable for what their assignments are.  It is not as stressful on nights when we don\u2019t have to rush older kids to get changed into uniforms & out the door by 5:15 to have my husband take them to activities because then it\u2019s just eating into their free time if it\u2019s not done yet. I feel stressed by being left with all the little kids in a chaotic environment which means I have to watch them closer if it\u2019s not tidy and toddler safe and have to get dinner on the table plus grade my 8th & 7th graders homeschool assignments while my husband and the helpful kids are out of the house.  So I asked my husband who teleworks to come out of his office when he\u2019s done with work (sometime between 4:30 and 5) to help manage kids so I\u2019m not doing it alone with so many moving parts. He agreed to help more but he doesn\u2019t care if kids are actually done or not and still takes off for activities. I don\u2019t want them to go if they aren\u2019t completely done with their chores. My husband thinks I have too high of expectations and shouldn\u2019t care if for example a kid says they are done but didn\u2019t pick up dog poop. I think this teaches them to not be responsible and also has future consequences that directly impact me like when kids are playing in the backyard and come running in with dog poop stuck in their shoes that I now have to clean.  This is a reoccurring conflict in our marriage that I want the house to get straightened up at certain points throughout the day because it makes my job as a homeschooling stay at home mom easier to monitor for safety if things don\u2019t spiral out of control. AITA for trying to hold kids accountable or for even trying to keep the house picked up? ",

        "selftext": "Short and sweet- my brother and I got a gift card for my dad over three years ago (large sum). It was given to him without me present- his choice not to wait. He made a card with the information on it. I\u2019m not sure when I saw it. He had been unreliable in the past. I wrote said gift card number down to verify the amount was correct.  Jump to last feb. I found the handwritten numbers and thought they were a gift card of mine since it was just jumbled into my stack of cards. My dad has been to this place many times since the gift was given. I never asked if he used it. I put it in, it worked! And, it was a lot! I used some of the funds to help my friend at the same time. I honestly didn\u2019t remember his card existed in that moment. I enjoyed what was purchased and kept living.  My dad went to use the gift card this year. \u201cArchived/unaccepted\u201d My brother does the due diligence and finds it\u2019s been used and the dates correlated with my activity.  He confronts me and says I am a thief and evil. I tell both of them I am sorry, I definitely used it, I didn\u2019t realize it at the time and I would pay my dad back immediately, dad says not now. This isn\u2019t good enough for my brother. He won\u2019t speak to me and had a full blown meltdown (manic depressive).  So, aita? My dad agreed to let me buy him another one or simply go with him next time he wants to make a purchase there but my brother won\u2019t accept that deal. He finally texted me today saying he has nothing to say to me until I admit guilt (I admitted I did it, just not maliciously) and that he won\u2019t talk until the card is replaced (dad said absolutely not and it\u2019s his card and he will let me know when he wants it replaced\u2026 idk why but after the last text I told him if it helps my relationship with my brother I am happy to go ahead and get the purchase taken care of).  I don\u2019t understand, my dad and I have the discrepancy and came to agreeable terms for repayment. ",

After a week she moved back to her apartment with her brother because of the compute. They had a roommate that's lease ended on 1 Jan and I moved in with her. Her brother and her own the apartment, but since his company said he has to be back at the office one week a month, he has been traveling from his home city to stay in the apartment.  It's a two bed one bath. The first weeks weeks we were together was great. First time we have gotten to live together just us as a married couple. Then her brother came over. He's a decent guy and I like him. He's also an actuary and doing fine.  He and my wife (brother and sister) are best friends. They have an incredible relationship. Two nights ago in bed she told me he will be staying two weeks a month till August when he saves up enough to buy another place. I told her that we (34M, 32F) have not gotten any time to be married couple and she wants  a baby so when the baby comes (hopefully later this year) we will have never had any time to just be us as a couple, develop that relationship.  First thing the next morning she told him and he wanted to move out. She was depressed the whole day. That night I sat us all down at the dinner table and said we need to talk to each other. I explained myself again that we never got time to be a couple and he agreed. I invited him to stay as long as he wanted. My wife was happy and he said he would rather move to his own place and grow to our full couple potential everyone agreed. The next night my wife and I were at the mall shopping for a potato ricer so I could make us all gnocchi. When he called and we had to rush him to the hospital because, well no one told me why. When we got back to the appartment to fetch him he has a runny nose but they decided he could drive his own car and she would go with him. I stayed as I has a late night work commitment (IT deployment) They went, the doctor put him on a drip and they came back with some over the counter flu meds. That was yesterday. Today I joked that he could rent a place that my wife and I are looking to buy as a investment property. It's a joke because none of us can afford to live there if it wasn't paying for itself as an investment.  The both took that extremely seriously and my wife said that I made him feel unwelcome in the apartment. Am I the asshole?  Edit: my wife and I rent the apartment from her and her brother at full market value.  He moved in because his work from home policy changed. When I agreed to move here and away from my place outside the city, it was just my wife and I renting the apartment. So that she and he would not have to go through the trouble of finding a tenant to take over.",

        "selftext": "Alright, Reddit, I really need your input because I\u2019m seriously starting to lose it. I (25 M) am a graduate student in CompSci in Florida, living with my two boyfriends, one is 25 and the other is 23. We\u2019re all just barely scraping by. We all graduated undergrad in CompSci, and now we\u2019re doing our Masters, hoping that maybe\u2014just maybe\u2014things will get better. But here\u2019s the thing: the job market for CompSci is absolutely DEAD. I\u2019ve applied everywhere\u2014Starbucks, Chick-Fil-A, McDonald\u2019s, Walmart, Publix\u2014hell, I\u2019ve even tried random fast food chains and retail jobs\u2014and nothing. No openings. I\u2019m so broke, I\u2019m working DoorDash, Uber, Lyft, and doing random odd jobs just to pay bills and buy food. To make matters worse, we\u2019re stuck with this shitty condo we bought five years ago when we thought life would be easier (spoiler alert: it\u2019s not). Now, we\u2019re drowning in mortgage payments, so we decided to rent out our 3-bedroom, 1-bath condo for a decent price, hoping to get some help covering the bills. Me and my boyfriends are planning to move in with the 23-year-old\u2019s parents, and we\u2019re going to share one room to save money (because who wouldn\u2019t want to live like that?). So, these three college students came by for a tour. They barely showed any interest in the place, which was whatever, but then as they left, they just stood outside and started talking about how awful the place was. Like, LOUDLY. They could\u2019ve been a little more discreet, but nope, they just tore into it. And you know what? That was the final straw for me. I\u2019ve been struggling, stressed to the max, just trying to get through school, hoping that maybe\u2014just maybe\u2014I\u2019ll be able to land a job someday (but with how things are going, who the hell knows?). I\u2019m sick of it. So I walked outside and, yes, I fucking screamed at them about how hard it is to be a college student in this economy, especially a CompSci major with no job prospects. I ranted about how I\u2019ve applied to every damn job and can\u2019t get hired anywhere, how I\u2019m doing everything I can just to survive, and how even with a Masters, I don\u2019t know if anything will actually change. I may have used some\u2026 colorful language. Now I\u2019ve got a warning from my condo\u2019s HOA, saying if I do something like that again, I\u2019ll get a $450 fine. Seriously. They want me to just sit back and take it, while I\u2019m drowning in debt and frustration? I\u2019m just tired of pretending everything\u2019s fine when it\u2019s not. So, AITA for losing it and screaming at them? I get that I shouldn\u2019t have gone off like that, but can you blame me? Everything feels like it\u2019s falling apart, and I\u2019m just trying to survive.",

        "selftext": "AITA for asking my sisters to wear dresses that coordinate together (dusty shades of blue or green and floral print encouraged) even though they're not bridesmaids? I am having a private ceremony (traditional reception immediately after) with only immediate family for my wedding and we are not having bridesmaids/groomsmen. My parents died when I was 16 and my siblings were all young adults, so they're all I have for immediate family. I have 3 sisters who I sent Pinterest photos to and shared my vision for the ceremony in terms of how I'd like their dresses with go with the color scheme, mostly so that family photos will turn out nice and nobody is harshly clashing. Long story short, they're all looking at above the knee summer dresses that are way more casual than I was hoping and also only seem to be looking at cheap Amazon dresses. My middle sister continuously makes jokes about my wedding.(This middle sister also happens to be one who eloped for her second wedding and didn't tell me until after it happened, yet when I announced my engagement said I better be maid of honor) I finally said something to them and asked why they didn't seem to be taking thingS seriously. Were they mad they weren't bridesmaids? I also asked what they had against longer dresses, as I think they look classier, and my oldest sister finally told me You can't expect us to dress so specifically if we're not part of a wedding party. You don't get to have those expectations This is the only thing I've asked of them that leans towards more of a wedding party task I guess. I haven't asked them to throw any pre-wedding parties, haven't asked them to help decorate or anything, and I had even planned a sisters weekend bachelorette party for us. AITA?",

        "selftext": "Involves myself (30F), my sister (twin) and our mom tangentially. Saturday evening was a common friend's engagement and only I attended, as sis lives out of country. My parents are away, time zones make our days/nights flipped (sis and I live in the same TZ). After the party around 1AM, I call the family chat and mom and sis picked up - I called to debrief on the engagement. Mom mentioned that our cousin was sick and that her dad went to a party alone (family birthday, which I knew about). She mentioned the party was the day before and I fixated on that - we had a quick back and forth about the date of the party - \u00a0this convo was 2 mins max, being very generous. \u00a0Sis apparently asked 4 times, what party? When mom and I finished the convo, I immediately answered sis and that's when I realized she'd disconnected. I thought maybe her phone died/Internet issue and continued talking to mom about the engagement because I figured I'd talk to my sis during the day, but wasn't sure when I'd speak to mom again. I even messaged right away asking what was wrong and why she wasn't on the call. But like I said, I thought it wasn't intentional and it's late, so whatever. I call my sis later on Sunday in the PM and ask what happened. Paraphrasing here, but the gist is, she said she didn't have to waste her time on the call when people are ignoring her and that it was extremely rude to not answer her when she asked four times and she was tired of being made insignificant. I got upset because if she had waited another minute, I would have answered. Sis said I should have answered immediately - that in the back and forth, one of us could have responded. I asked what was wrong with us finishing this minor thread before responding. There was a fight and we didn't talk. Today, I call sis again because I know she would be interested in the gossip and there were some things I wanted to run by her. However, I was still really frustrated by everything and after a little chit chat, I started the topic by mentioning along the lines that if my sist had been a little patient, I wouldn't have to go over this again. She blew up at me that she was tired of feeling insignificant and having her questions ignored. I responded again that 2 mins is not that long of a time and it just devolved again - I said something like it's a waste of time to repeat an hour long convo for this reason and she twisted it into I'm saying it's a waste of time talking to her. But then, I'm thinking, well, you thought it was a waste of your time to wait for 2 minutes, so why can't I think it's a waste to spend an hour rehashing everything? I get having to repeat convos/stories separately with my mom and my sis, but that's normally because one person wasn't available. But in this case, she was on the call and I feel this was a really petty reason to hang up. So, AITA because I did not immediately answer my sister's question instead of at the end of a conversation thread that lasted max 2 minutes?",

        "selftext": "New account because I'm pretty sure my step dad is chronically on reddit. I (17 F) have a cat named Fluff and have had him for at least three-four years. He was originally a feral the neighbors had picked up from the road; never took care of him and me and him eventually bonded so he chooses me over anyone else, even after we moved to our new house around last June. (This is important for later) Along with Fluff, we had another cat who passed, named Lynx. He was also from the neighbors. On day one of begging to bring my cats to the new house (they were going to ditch them and leave them to be neglected) my step father (36 M) said they were **my cats** and they'd be my responsibility. They paid for their food only (i paid for vet visits, even when i didn't have enough money to buy my own stuff); i paid to put Lynx down and cremated after he got sick since i didnt have enough money to give him the proper treatment for maggots and didn't want him to suffer. I just recently bought Fluff a tracking collar and a carrier, explaining to my step father (lets call him Jack for jackass) when he asked that I would be taking my cat with me to college. He got angry and berated me for a while, saying what he says goes and that Fluff would be unhappy with me and that I'd go nowhere in life. In the midst of his desperation, he even offered to buy me a kitten and to pay for the shots.  The problem is, I don't want to replace Fluff with a new kitten, and he doesn't see that. Jack hardly even looks at my cat (which, btw, hes saying its HIS cat now) and I'm scared that when I leave he's going to be neglected again. Fluff has gone through a lot for a 5 year old (roughly around) cat already, and I don't want him to be scared of being around the house again (hes an outside cat since he was a feral; ive been training him and he does well. Jack left him out during the harsh winter storm we had a bit back.) I'd have a dorm and I could legally register him as my emotional support animal; and this would all be in another year or so after i try to get income to save.

I hate living here. I have to share a room with their 6 year old because they only have 3 bedrooms and they won\u2019t put her in their room or with her brothers. Their cars are way too small for 6 people (one only seats 5 and one is a truck with 3 seats in front and 3 in back and I always have to sit in the front middle seat in the truck because all of the kids need booster seats or car seats). They make me babysit their kids twice a week just for some of the money they get for me and the food situation sucks. I\u2019ve been here for 4 months and we haven\u2019t gone to a real restaurant once, unless you count the trip to Applebees for their son\u2019s birthday. I can\u2019t even leave campus for lunch even tho my school is open campus unless I pay for my own food.  We also argue all the time because I have way more chores than their kids and my allowance isn\u2019t enough to do shit. They\u2019re even making me get a job so when I get a car I can pay them back. And the cars they want me to get suck! They\u2019re all older than me.  We got into another argument yesterday because I refused to participate in their little weekly \u201ctradition\u201d. Every Thursday they go grocery shopping at Costco then after grocery shopping they go to the food court and everyone gets hot dogs, pizza, and ice cream. I told her Costco nights suck and if they want to go out to eat they should at least take us to a real restaurant but she said the only way they\u2019re skipping Costco nights is if I figure out another way for the entire family to eat with drinks and dessert for less than $20 without her having to cook or clean up. That budget is impossible so I decided to stay home and use the emergency card they gave me to DoorDash some real food. They saw the charge that night and took the money out of my bank account to pay them back. I told them this is bullshit and it\u2019s their job to take care of me. She told me if I don\u2019t think they\u2019re taking care of me I should go to a real foster home and see how they treat me. We haven\u2019t talked since and she didn\u2019t even pack my lunch this morning so I\u2019m stuck getting school lunch (which tastes like shit) just because she\u2019s being petty. I tried telling my school counselor about this and he\u2019s usually pretty chill but he said I was acting a bit spoiled and I should\u2019ve gotten a hot dog or made myself a sandwich and sucked it up until I can go home or move out.

Eventually, I know she'll need something from me like a signature for the car. She refuses to refinance because she doesn't want to meet with me. Mutual friends have been saying I should have collected money from her for partial amount of the debt. I don't have as good of a job as she does now.

        "selftext": "For context, I have been with my girlfriend for 11 years and I turned vegan 3 years ago for ethical reasons. Before that, I was not eating a lot of meat, but I knew that I was not really doing the best thing (ethically). I was not vegan because I did not want to create any friction with family, friends, etc. but at some point, I decided to go vegan. For me, it doesn't make sense to kill/harm animals when I can just buy a can of chickpeas or buy some tofu instead. My girlfriend understands this and stayed omnivore, because she doesn't want to give up on things that she loves to eat. We live together so, me switching up to veganism obviously impacted her since we cook together only vegan/vegan adaptable meals. She sometimes buys cheese, milk, chicken and fish that she cooks for herself. Other than being vegan, I have a full time job and have many hobbies that take a lot of my time (competing in Ironmans, learning multiple languages, etc), so it is a struggle to spend a lot of good quality time with my girlfriend. Anyway, on her birthday, I came late from work and I went to a restaurant where they make some Poke bowls. I wanted to make her happy and knew that if she was with me, she would order the salmon poke bowl, but I ended up ordering a vegan Poke bowl anyway, because I did not think her birthday would justify me spending money on an industry that I really don't want to encourage. I felt that even tough it would no be her choice, it would still be a nice gesture. When I came back home with the vegan poke bowls, she was disappointed and kind of angry at me because she knew exactly what went in my head when I bought the bows. She felt that even on her birthday, I could not do any compromise and think solely about what she wanted. She says that even when I give something to somebody else, I don't put myself purely in their heads and that I always filter my actions based on MY standards. What do you think ? Edit : Thank you for all your comments. I am a selfish a*hole and definitely have to work on being a better boyfriend and a better person in general. My girlfriend is a wonderful person and I mistreated her. I will put myself more in her shoes next time I want to treat her and put myself and my standards out of the way. ",

        "selftext": "AITA? Like the title says, my Fianc\u00e9 is currently not speaking to me because I picked up a second job. I am currently a high school teacher who moved grades, so that means I am learning a new curriculum and working longer hours. Often, I am not getting home until 5:30-6:00 at night. My Fianc\u00e9 usually arrives home between 4-5pm. I was previously coaching esports so that meant some nights it was 6:30-7pm that I was arriving home. Now where we get to the problem, I am a total nerd and love to fly drones. I got offered the opportunity to fly a very expensive drone to film the football team. I was asked to film practices once a week and game nights. Due to my coaching responsibilities, I would have had to work game nights anyways, so I didn\u2019t think one extra day would be a huge deal. I underestimated how much time it would take out of my day and jumped on the opportunity. I did not speak with my Fianc\u00e9 first, and he was understandably upset. We had a fight and I fully took responsibility for not discussing it with him before I agreed to the position.  The athletic department was impressed enough by my work to replace me at esports (at my request in order to give me more time at home) and offer to pay me to exclusively fly the drone the second half of the year. They also want me to do it next year and have offered to double the percentage I was receiving for coaching esports. I have been ecstatic! I\u2019ve been telling everyone about it because I am so excited to be paid more for something I love. They do want me to film some of all of the major sports, but I do not have to do every game. Maybe a 1-2 times a week requirement of my time, but they are late nights. AITA for doing something I love 1-2 days a week on top of an already busy schedule?  Edit to clarify: My Fianc\u00e9 believes that I purposely misled him about which sports I would be filming. He was under the impression that I would only be filming football. I am confused about this because football is not year round. I don\u2019t know if I specifically told him I\u2019d be filming all major sports. I do remember discussing giving up esports to film exclusively year round. I remember discussing what I should request for my filming percentage. And before this argument happened, I filmed a soccer game to get a feel for filming the sport, and sent him selfies of me working the game. He said that he is \u201cdrifting away from me and no longer feels connected to me\u201d due to my work schedule.",

        "selftext": "I (19F) have been living with my roommate (18F) since the beginning of the Fall semester. In the first few weeks, things were fine, but over time, we became distant and passive-aggressive about our shared space. I have acute migraines and need the room pitch black to sleep, as any light triggers migraines. I\u2019ve talked to my roommate multiple times about this, and while she seemed to understand, lights continued to be left on, including her extremely bright alarm clock. I tried to handle it and sleep with some lights on, but she then brought in a new light that illuminated the whole room in purple, adding to the already bright alarm clock. One night, I tried to wake her up to talk about it, but she was asleep, and I couldn\u2019t turn the light off. After waiting a couple of hours for it to turn off on its own (it didn\u2019t), I unplugged it. I planned to talk to her about it in the morning, but when I woke up, she had left for class and left a note saying I needed to stop touching her stuff, and that the light would have turned off on its own. I didn\u2019t think much of it and decided to discuss it with her later. When she came back, she immediately started complaining about me touching her things, saying she likes having a light in the room, and that she\u2019s had to compromise on everything. She mentioned how she likes keeping the window open at night, and I always close it because I\u2019m afraid of break-ins. She also mentioned hating my curtain that blocks sunlight (the one she said I could have), and how I turn off her fairy lights at night, which I did to reduce light when she was asleep. She argued that the new light wasn\u2019t facing me, so it shouldn\u2019t be an issue, but it was still bright enough to illuminate the whole room.

My husband thought it would be more fun if we had them over at the same time as the game. He invited them without asking me.  Living so far from my side of the family always makes me homesick on game day. Watching it with people who think sports are dumb makes it even harder. Still, I hear you all and have told them to stay for the whole game, and who knows maybe we'll all have more fun than we expected.  Edited: They bought in hard. Great Game. Great company.

She is fine with certain jokes when she makes them but has weird conditions - for example, she's fine with calling me stupid and vice versa, but my calling her a loser as nothing but a joke was too much. She asserted that if I really cared for her, I would've known that this would offend her. All my friends sided with me when I told them about this, but they're bound to biased.",

        "selftext": "This is a theme in my relationship: I\u2019ll be doing something in a flow state and then my partner jolts me out of it.  Today, for example I was drumming - eyes shut, in a groove with my little steel hand drum on the kitchen table. My partner, who has been working in the yard comes inside. I hear the door open and shut and I\u2019m in such a sweet groove I decide to keep it going thinking he\u2019ll enjoy it. He comes over and caresses my butt, throwing me right off. I say: damn and sigh. Then I go lie down because I was heading for a nap when I saw the drum.  Two hours later I wake up to a temper tantrum from him, saying there\u2019s too many rules about when he can or can\u2019t interact with me. I say: it\u2019s basic respect not to interrupt.  Another example: I\u2019ve been working through The Artist\u2019s Way book, which is about helping you recover your creativity. One of the tools they suggest you do every morning shortly after waking up is write three pages longhand.  So I get up after a cuddle and go into another room and start writing. I\u2019m right in the flow and he comes in wanting to know something  (don\u2019t remember what but it wasn\u2019t urgent).  I give him the answer and tell him I prefer not to be interrupted when I\u2019m writing and that also ends up with him raising his voice and basically ranting.  Example 3: I\u2019m in my home office, with big chunky headphones on, eyes closed and meditating, and he pats me on the knee to tell me something. That time I got mad and said: I\u2019m meditating can\u2019t you see? He thinks I\u2019m being disrespectful because I didn\u2019t greet him as he came in the door. I think he\u2019s being disrespectful because he interrupts me.  Help, please. AITA? \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014- Edit to add a few random answers to questions: We are both at home, all the time. I\u2019m happy to see him, and responsive all the other minutes of all the other days.  I would love to meditate for 10 - 20 mins every day but right now I hardly do at all because it\u2019s hard to meditate while tracking his movements so I won\u2019t be startled if he interrupts me. I\u2019d also like to write for 20 mins every day and at the moment I\u2019m doing that but floating along on the surface of things and staying available and aware of him - it\u2019s not my best writing though because of that. I drum once in a blue moon for a couple of minutes.  These may sound like trivial occurrences, but they are just the latest in the pattern. When I was working from home as a coder he would also get upset if I told him I couldn\u2019t talk right now because I was working out a complex problem and would lose my way.  He also objects to closed doors. And I\u2019ve tried big chunky headphones as the visual signal. Steel hand drums are not imaginary \ud83e\udd28 They make a lovely melodic sound.  We had a difficult chat yesterday about this and now I realise, as one commenter said below, that he has never experienced a flow state or even an active listening-to-intuition state. So has no idea where I\u2019m coming from.  ",

I also play video games and some of these games involve a lot of clicking, like Monster Hunter, Marvel Rival, and League of Legends. My roommate is irritated with all the clicking and has asked me multiple times to just not play the games while she is in the room. Now I have made accommodations for her, like not playing games while she is doing schoolwork, not being on the phone while she is doing schoolwork, bought new headphones so I could speak quieter at night while on Discord with my buddies.  She still calls me inconsiderate and selfish for not ceasing the clicking while she is in the room because it bothers her and is super grating to hear She confronted me about it today and we got into an 'argument', but I told her I would not stop because I enjoy playing games. Some things that I do that I know are bad habits though, is I will lose track of time and stay up pretty late (12am EST at the latest) but I am not super loud, or yelling or anything past dark I have some screenshots that I am willing to share if I can  UPDATE: We have both said our arguments and apologized for our harsh words. We have come up with a compromise, we will keep our no games while studying and add on so that after 10-ish pm, I will not play the clicky games such as Rivals, League or Monster Hunter. We have also decided that if something else comes up, we will discuss it there and then instead of letting it fester and becoming a problem. Thank you guys for being so mean to me lol, it helped open my eyes and suck it up and talk to her.",

Now, for context, I am a female, and my business name is a punny version of my name and the murderer combined. I've never had an issue with it before, and have even received compliments on the creativity of it in the realm of work I do.  Recently I was told that the name associated with my business may come off to certain people as intimating or flat out insensitive. I obviously asked for them to elaborate, and they believed that because a large percent of my clientele are women, they would be scared to contact me or the business due to the fact that I named myself after a person that murdered women in the 1800s. Of course, this was not my intention. But now I'm being interrogated by someone very close to me as to why I chose this name in the first place. The words immature and hypocritical were brought up, and even a reference to an old middle school email you regret but can't change. But I have built my whole career off of this name, and carry myself in a very professional and friendly way. Either online or in person. I also feel I am pretty successful in my business as well and recieve amazing reviews about my personality and bedside manner.  I'm just saddened to hear that someone I care about claimed some pretty bold assumptions of me being sexist or insensitive to women, and flat out don't care about women being murdered even in present day. Which is definitely not the case. I honestly understand the history, and the connotation, but am I really the asshole? ",

There has been lots of issues and for the longest time I\u2019ve said I will break up with him. We have been together for 4 years, so I have sort of created the problem I am in now. We spent Christmas and new years apart as I really don\u2019t get along with his family. Because of our jobs we are also currently living about 4 hours away so just this week I finally got to see him, I went over to his.  My parents had picked up on the time that my bf has spent here where I live, that I tend to pay for most things, and although we aim to do 50-50 split, for the most part he was earning about 2x than what I make and we still even split but I\u2019d end up paying for most things when we are out.  So my parents are concerned about this, I don\u2019t know what to do because I\u2019m very attached but here is where I might be the asshole: I showed my mom some jewellerymy partner gave me for Christmas. This was after about 3 years of hints as he never spent more than \u00a340 on gifts but spends lots on booze and again the gifts I gave him were far far more than what he spent on me.  My mom started making fun of the jewlerry, pointing out it was a fake. She also pointed out how my brother was about to get me the same jewellery over Christmas as it was on 50% sale. She also mentioned how much of a cheap ass he was, and how naive I was too take the jewellery. I didn\u2019t actually know if it was fake or not I was pleased he got me something other than candles. Even tho I agree a bit with her I snapped and told her she was a horrible person and that she had raised me to be like this so she should stop asking the world to treat me like a princess when she treats me like shit (her main argument is that I deserve more attention and thoughtfulness from a bf).The conversation obviously escalated and we both said some nasty things, I particularly said \u201cright cause your life is so hard we all have to be miserable with you?\u201d Bc my mom is going through a particularly rough job situation and I also said \u201cmaybe if you treated me better I would think I deserve more\u201d this is coming of the backend of my mom always been very a volatile parent. I also said I hated her and that she was just like her mom, and she was probably end up on her own as she pushes everyone away. I\u2019m not proud of what I said but writing it out so I\u2019m honest about the situation. She apologised profusely after it but I\u2019m very butt hurt about the whole situation.

I wish you the best though!\u201d I realize now this text was the opportunity she wanted to launch into a diatribe of all the things I did wrong in the relationship and that she felt offended by. I had NO idea. One of these things was a miscommunication about driving to the airport. (A year and a half ago!) She messaged me in August 2023 about driving her to the airport at 6 in September. I said sure, even though this is something that I would not normally ask of a friend (I would ask my mom for or get an uber. Gas is expensive!) but I thought \u201cwell, she doesn\u2019t have a lot of family here\u201d so I said sure, you can get me a coffee and we\u2019ll call it even. I\u2019m a morning person so I figured she was asking me to drive her at 6 am. If I had known she meant 6pm I would have not agreed in the first place.  So flight day arrives and I roll up to her place at 6. I call her. Dial tone. Finally I get a hold of her and she says that the flight was at 6pm. We both apologized for the misunderstanding. I go back home to bed. I get up for work and am feeling (understandably?) tired and a bit grumpy. I send her a text saying \u201chey, I\u2019m not upset at you, but I am a bit grumpy about this miscommunication and am going to have to politely decline to drive you at 6pm tonight to rest\u201d I gave her notice and she replied \u201ctotally fair, I\u2019m so sorry for the mix up!\u201d and she sent me a starbucks giftcard for my trouble, which was a sweet but totally unnecessary gesture. She got to the airport, I wished her a nice vacation, and we caught up when she got back. I thought all was well.  Folks, all was not well. She had apparently held on to this resentment as \u201cI broke a promise\u201d to her. She said me cancelling was selfish cause she couldn\u2019t afford an uber and was shocked that I didn\u2019t rearrange my schedule to drive her at 6pm. She apparently had to take a bus and then get another friend to drive her \u201cwho dropped everything for her\u201d. She was flabbergasted that she \u201csent me the giftcard and then I cancelled! WHO DOES THAT?!\u201d Apparently I didn\u2019t prioritize her and didn\u2019t care about her feelings and wellbeing as I knew how much this trip meant to her. I looked back and she sent me the giftcard after I declined to drive her. I thought it was a nice gesture at the time, but now I feel like she felt like I owed it to her to say \u201caww, since you got me coffee I WILL drive you now\u201d. I thought this was a simple favour that I could revoke cause circumstances changed and not \u201ca promise\u201d. I am doubly confused cause she said over text that it was fine at the time. Am I the asshole for not realizing this was a dealbreaker? ",

        "selftext": "Today, after going to the gym, my parents and I had an appointment with a math tutor to see if I was eligible and what I could gain. My grades aren't awful (B\u2019s-C\u2019s), but I don\u2019t understand a lot of the fundamentals and I do terribly on tests. I\u2019m in geometry, which is normal for my age.  My dad (58M) dropped me off at the appointment, and after I finished a test to assess my math skills, I was bored and decided to go get food. I couldn\u2019t find a place to sit, so I texted my mom (51F)to complain a bit, mostly just because I wanted to talk to her. When my parents came back, I called my dad to find him, and when I finally did, I was upset because he told me there *was* seating in Fry\u2019s (my mom must\u2019ve told him about the texts). I had just walked around for 10 minutes trying to find a seat, so I didn\u2019t believe him and was frustrated. We started arguing, and my mom shut it down saying, Why are we arguing over bullshit? I felt embarrassed because there were little kids around, and I was still upset. After we met with the tutor inside and we were walking out I told them the tutoring might not work (I know, I was being stupid) On the drive home, I was venting to my mom (I usually talk to her about my dad), but then she started screaming at me. She called me a bunch of names cunt,bitch,disgusting and a narcissist and ungrateful for everything they do for me. I tried to explain that I was just nervous about the tutoring situation, but she kept berating me. She complained about being busy, driving me around for things like swimming practice, a sport I don\u2019t enjoy or want to do. I find it hard to feel sorry for her when a lot of the stress is self-inflicted. She is also choosing to have two jobs and keeps saying she has no time for herself (my dad makes enough for my family to live comfortably and her income is not much, but we respect it because she \u201clikes to be busy\u201d she says) At one point, I snapped and called her childish and narcissistic, and she flipped out even more. When we got home, I felt a bit bad, so I apologized to my dad and thanked him for signing me up for tutoring, even though he reassured me that he wasn\u2019t upset. Now I\u2019m feeling confused. I\u2019ve forgiven my mom for everything in the past, but it feels like she really hates me, and I don\u2019t know why. I\u2019m wondering if I was justified in calling her childish and narcissistic, or if I should have just let it go and kept my mouth shut.  AITA?",

He asks me if we would be able to share the machine and alternate between sets. I politely declined and had not specified any reasons as I did not want to come across as rude. He immediately asks how many sets I plan on doing to which I respond 6. He then says that I would be wasting his time if I didn\u2019t share with him and that I was selfish for not sharing.

It was her birthday a month ago however because she was on winter holiday her coworkers never congratulated her properly. Today they got her a large bouquet of flowers as a gift. Since our home is only 15 minutes away walking from her work she never goes there by car. Due to the large quantity of flowers she wanted me to come to her work and help her carry them home. I'm a a high-school senior in my last year of IB. As she knows I have a lot of work with the program and college applications. I don't mind going to help her if there is an important matter, like if she forgot her nurse uniform, however for a matter as trivial as this I think there are other solutions that can be taken that don't require my help. It should be noted that we live in a N\u00feordic country which is currently receiving a lot of snow and under negative 10 degree Celsius weather. Getting ready to leave the house on top of the journey to and back seems pointless for a task that is relatively unnecessary. The flowers can be carried in 2 trips on different days as I repeatedly pointed out over the phone. Am I the asshole for not helping her? Update: in light of the overwhelming majority of comments I can't ignore a resounding YTA. I have apologized to my mom and will be going to help since her shift ends lie today.

Basically, me and my friends had been planning to go out to lunch during one of the weekends and we had been planning this for about two weeks. When the day rolls around, I ended having to be taken there by my grandma and at the time, my cousin was with my grandma also. I was running a bit late but while we\u2019re riding in the car, my grandma brings up that I\u2019m going out to eat and decides to ask me if my cousin can come, I ended up saying sure and gave my friends a heads up that my cousin was coming although there was a bit a protest from them, there was nothing I could do because I didn\u2019t wanna tell her no and my cousin doesn\u2019t really have a lot of friends and we have always bit sort of close. So we get to the restaurant and things go as they should, my cousin doesn\u2019t really talk to anyone besides me and isn\u2019t bothering anyone, she just eats and pays for her own food as everyone does. Today my friend text me telling me that he thought it was really weird that I invited my cousin to a gathering that was for friends and something we had been planning for a while. I blew this off because I didn\u2019t see it as that big a deal but he told me he was serious and asked why I would invite her, I told him that there was no harm in it and that she minded her own business the entire time. He protested and told me that wasn\u2019t the point and it was mainly the fact that I invited her without consulting anyone else and as I said before we were literally in the car on the way to the restaurant when \u201cI invited\u201d her. He then thought it would be good to say \u201cns idk why ur gma even let her go she knew it was like a friend thing\u201d and to me this sounded so stupid because my grandma obviously didn\u2019t see any harm in inviting her and was only trying to help my cousin out. Of course I understand where he\u2019s coming from but she literally sat there and did nothing but eat and talk to me and he\u2019s complaining now? Mind you this happened months ago.

My family is wanting to do some sort of celebration but mentally and physically I\u2019m not up for hosting a big event.

My mom is the one throwing and paying for everything. My husband\u2019s family is wanting a huge celebration but not willing to host or contribute anything financially. Edit 2- For additional clarification, It is at a French tea/coffee house in my area known for hosting small events in a private room. My mom (the host) would be paying for finger foods/pastries and drinks for guests. If a guest felt as though the refreshments we were to provide are not enough, the venue does have a menu where people can purchase additional food or drinks for themselves. It would be after traditional lunch time (maybe late lunch for some) 3/4pm. We aren\u2019t asking people to pay for their \u201cportion\u201d of what\u2019s already being provided.

When she went to book us massages, the spa mentioned that they only service 18 and older fur full body massages. So aunt booked me a manicure, pedicure, and facial instead, while she and my mom got to have the whole works with a nice full body massage. Here\u2019s the thing, I\u2019ve had plenty of manicures and pedicures so getting them doesn\u2019t really feel very \u2018fancy spa like\u2019 or pampering. I asked my sing if she could just tell them I\u2019m 18 (since I have always been told I look a few years older) but she wouldn\u2019t.  We get to the spa and they immediately take my mom and aunt back but I had to wait almost an hour for my facial masseuse to come get me. The lady kind of rushed it, and was in a hurry to get me out of the room when she was done. The mani and pedi was nothing different from your typical nail salon visit. I then had to wait almost an hour afterward in the lobby for my mom and aunt bc they wanted to go swimming in the whirlpool and hot tubs. We went to lunch nearby afterward and my mom asked me why I was so grumpy and I said that no worries I wasn\u2019t. She then kept prying so I then broke it to her that it wasn\u2019t fair I didn\u2019t get nearly the same luxurious treatments they were bragging about on the way to lunch, just because I\u2019m younger. The mani and pedi didn\u2019t feel anything more luxurious than going to a nail salon. It also wasn\u2019t fair I had to wait over an hour in the lobby while they got to enjoy the amenities without inviting me down. My mom angrily snapped that I\u2019m also the only one if the three who doesn\u2019t work a full time job nor did I pay for any of it, and that one day when I start working and can afford it, then I can enjoy a nice treatment. She then revealed that my pedicure was $80, which I think is steep bc it was no better than a nail salon visit. My aunt didn\u2019t say anything, but WITA here? ",

I (19 M) was talking to my coworker (26 F) about how my ex stepdad/My brother's dad was supposed to help me move in one Friday (he offered because I was living with him), but when I called to ask him if he was ready and he was confused on what I was meaning and he didn't know we would be doing it so early in the day. (it was a little before noon but he was told a week before when and what day) He had to go to one of his younger kids school to have birthday lunch with her which was fine I said we could do it after, but his now girlfriend ( not my mom) said I was trying to ruin her daughters bday and I was an asshole and must of planned it. So he hung up called me back and asked if he could do it Saturday, but I had to stay at a family friends house to watch their dogs and so I said that was fine and I would send him a picture of how I wanted it since I couldn't be there to help him or do it myself. Well he had got there threw it in my room not at all how I sent him and my roomates family had to do it because they felt bad.  I was upset more because they had to do it and I didn't say anything to him about it and still thanked him for doing it... but my coworker said I was an asshole for trying to make him  set up my whole house and I was being entitled. I feel like considering I had it all planned for him but he forgot about it inconveniencing me and then I couldn't be there I was in my rights to be frustrated with him... So am I the Asshole?  edit-  I feel like people are coming at me because I started a fight with him or something but like the the oh post I thanked him for doing it and offered gas to which he said no to, I didn\u2019t argue with him about it but I feel I should still be able to be upset that he didn\u2019t do it when he said he would and told my roommate and her family he knew how I wanted it but didn\u2019t care to do and said I wouldn\u2019t mind in left.  obviously I do mind and he didn\u2019t put like pictures or thing small things like that for me up he just had to put a bed and my desk in there and that was it.

        "selftext": "Hello all. This incident occurred last Tuesday, but I should first provide some background: I have a body odor problem, and have gotten teased at different points of my life. I often use a bottle of cologne (Azarro Sport) to override this when I venture out into the public.  I am a high school student, but frequently attend college lectures with the permission of the professor as I believe it to be one of the best ways to consistently strengthen my mathematical knowledge. I have time-to-time received hostile remarks for my displaced priorities, but never so many as I had this lecture. (...) At around 5:10 PM, before it began, I had received strange gestures from my peers. An individual I had known by proxy cringed at the smell only moments after I had arrived in the line to the lecture hall. Furthermore, I heard 5-10 utterings regarding a sharp smell. I sat at the corner of the lecture hall (not a particularly large room), where the individual I had sat beside gave me a dude what the fuck. All seats were occupied at this point, and those around me did not relocate or vacate the room. Me and several other suspects were hit with dirty looks from those in front of us, though I am observant enough to admit that the vast majority of those stares were directed towards me. By the time class had started I was super embarrassed, even debating whether to walk out. I ultimately remained, as the smell's absence along with mine would affirm my guilt.  ~20 minutes into the lecture the professor commented something like I will ask that next time we be more conscientious of perfume use and consider those around us. At this point the only redeeming factor of my ordeal was that only a *few* people around me were of the conviction that I was responsible for the smell, and not the entire class. After the 50 minutes of class time had elapsed, I was the last to leave and politely waved the professor I walked around the halls to test if the smell remained by observing the reactions of those around me. Fortunately no one seemed to take heed, allowing me to, ignorantly, proceed to another lecture (Lagrangian Mechanics) with the conviction that the smell had subsided. When I entered the classroom before just before it filled up I was confronted by a former student of my own school. I assumed that they had noticed the scent during the last lecture and identified me as the culprit, as I was told passionately to go home. At this point it was not worth staying to observe the lecture; I left with the same aura of embarrassment and called a taxi home (during which, there was no remark of a strong scent). Ultimately I did act inappropriately simply as a result of my inexperience with cologne. I had always been told that body odor was ignorant and inconsiderate of my peers, but my solution had turned out to be paradoxical. I learned my lesson and understand that I acted with ignorance, (...) but do my actions demonstrate a corrupt flaw that reflects a truly bad disposition? ",

        "selftext": "EDIT: Switched to a full fake name instead of just using a single letter. 27M - Hi everyone. Yesterday at noon, I dropped off clothes at a consignment store. They have a policy: If you don't pick up your items after we're done sorting through it, we will donate what's left and give you store credit. Now my plan was that, after work, I would drop my wife off at home, head back to the store to pick everything up, run some other errands, and then return home. All of that changed when a truck barreled down the highway, rear-ended us and sent our car spinning. My wife and I were fine, but the back of our car was totaled. I'm calling friends that can pick us up and give us a ride home, while my wife, who is a PhD student, is texting her friend at her lab to see if she can help us out - we'll call her Jane. While we're constantly shifting between the car to gather our belongings and talking to the cops, I've got my wife's phone in my hands and it rings - it's Jane. I pick up and she's asking about how we're doing. I tell her we're getting all the information written down. And then in a moment of instinct, I mention to her that I still have all my stuff at the store and that I need help picking it up. That's how my brain works. I noticed that we were handling all the other stuff pretty well so I thought of the next steps in my plan. As I'm mentioning this, my wife sees me talking, and so I went oh never mind, I'll figure it out on my own. and hang up, giving my wife back her phone. Fast forward to this morning, my wife is furious, telling me that both Jane and her boyfriend were mad at me for asking for help. She's telling me that I should never call Jane to get my stuff, saying that she is not my friend, that I didn't even tell her that I did that, when I didn't make the call. Previously a package got delivered to our front door and I asked if Jane could help push it into our garage. According to my wife, Jane gets mad at me for asking, but when I told her thank you in person, she would tell me it was no problem. The way I see it, Jane is always complaining if someone needs help from her, but she will constantly ask other people for help on tasks that she needs to do herself. Even my wife agrees with that. My wife constantly talks to me about how Jane has lab work that she's made her boyfriend do, to the point that the boyfriend has joked that he deserves half a Ph.D. for how much work he's accomplished. My wife has also been called in to help Jane with lab work. I've apologized to my wife about talking to Jane directly and again, I know that the request is something that is super petty especially regarding the circumstances - obviously thinking about the clothes is pointless especially if our lives were on the line, but I thought that after we're okay, our belongings are okay, we're safe - I feel like I can take a brief second to think about my tasks. It just feels like after a car crash my wife and I should be more loving to each other and this has thoroughly split us in a rough way. So Reddit, am I the asshole?",

        "selftext": "I 18F have two friends F18 & F19, we\u2019re in our last year of highschool and we\u2019re all in the same class. We\u2019ve been friends for 3 years while they have been for around 4 or 5 years.  A little info about out friendship: I\u2019m a person that BOLDY expresses my opinions without sugarcoating which cause me to often come over harsh but factual. I make this known among my friends. My two friends often choose to ignore truth and feed into their delusions mainly about ex boyfriends. They both support going back to old habits while im trying to pull them out. Also I often make jokes that are sarcastic, but my two friends sometimes can\u2019t tell when im joking or not. I keep reminding them im 99% just playing with them and that its a part of my personality.  The backstory is, I made a joke in class about F19 for wearing an off shoulder top in 1\u00b0C weather and said that we are not in Spain and she should put some clothes on or she\u2019ll freeze to death. For some reason this made my other friend F18 flip out on me saying that i always criticize F19 on things like her past relationships, what she does etc and that I should stop. I told her that if F19 had a problem with my joke or things that i criticize she should stand up for herself or atleast not yell at me like that. We we\u2019re going back and forth and basically just having a meaningless argument eventually the teacher stepped in and everything calmed down.  Now they\u2019ve decided to ignore me and not talk to me. When i tell one of my other friends what happened they say stuff like. 'Maybe you came over a little aggresive\u2019 because i am known to do so. Everytime something like this happens between me and one of them, they always choose eachothers sides. I\u2019ve decided that i\u2019d rather have no friends then people who constantly criticize my personality and don\u2019t choose me back.  Now im wondering if im the Asshole for constantly critizing my friend F19, i\u2019ll give you some examples: i\u2019ll say that she\u2019s dumb for going back to her ex that cheated on her, i\u2019ll say that she\u2019s na\u00efve and that she can\u2019t stand up for herself when people take advantage of her. Etc etc..  So im debating if instead of being a bold person that states her opinions, im just an actual asshole and need to be nicer? Edit: altough I criticize, i\u2019m just trying to protect them from getting hurt. I still love them even though it may not look like it. ",

        "selftext": "Sorry if this is long, trying to paint the full picture here. My ex (33F) and I (32M) have a son (8M) together. Other than the odd disagreement we have coparented very well for quite a few years now. We have an agreement in place but it\u2019s flexible. We sit together at his sports, I go over there to play with him when it\u2019s not my designated time, we do holidays together, you get the idea. My son plays hockey and it\u2019s become his whole identity, it\u2019s all he wants to do ever. I grew up playing hockey and his mom is not sporty in the slightest, so it\u2019s something that him and I bond over and he is always asking for me to play with him. Thursday night after his practice he asked both his mom and I if I could come play with him in the basement after his game today (he has a set up in his basement at his moms with a full sized net and sheets of fake ice). We both have the okay and all was good. At the game today I told her that the outdoor rinks were finally good quality and ready (we are Canadian eh) so I was going to take him out to do that instead. She was fine with it, and he looked like a kid at Christmas when I told him. After his game we went straight there and played for 2 hours. He then told me he was hungry (after playing hockey for 3 hours straight no doubt). Important to note that this kid gives no warning, he goes from fine to starving in 3.2 seconds and has an utter meltdown like he hasn\u2019t eaten in 6 years every time. It\u2019s a known thing and a running joke between all friends and family. We were much closer to my place and I had not been given a time to have him home or mention of plans so we went back to my place to I could make him dinner quick before I took him back to his mom. I got a text from her as we were eating, she was planning on ordering them pizza and wanted to know how much longer we would be. When I told her we were eating already and I would drop him off soon she got extremely snippy with me, essentially telling me that I was stealing her time and that if I did that to her I would be pissed, it went on and on especially because I honestly can\u2019t figure out what the issue was. Should I have checked in and seen if she had plans? Maybe. Should she have said she had dinner plans for them? Also maybe. But she told me it wasn\u2019t about the food, it was about \u2018me stealing time from her\u2019. From the time we left his game to the time I dropped him off, fed, was less than 3 hours. Am I really the asshole here?",

        "selftext": "I (14m) have to go to my cousin\u2019s wedding with my parents this Saturday. That already sucks-I hate weddings, I can\u2019t stand formal clothes, and I absolutely hate shirts! And now my parents borrowed a suit from my cousin(from the other side of the family)\u2026 it\u2019s one of those suits with a vest, a white shirt, and a bow tie. I knew I wouldn\u2019t be able to get out of dressing up somehow, but I at least wanted a cool outfit like a black suit with a gray shirt or something. Definitely not a white shirt and absolutely no stupid bow tie. But my parents are saying that since I hate formal clothes anyway and won\u2019t wear them again before I outgrow them, they don\u2019t want to waste money. We had a fight about it, but no chance, I have to wear the full suit. I teased my cousin back then when he had to wear it. He hates formal clothes like me, and I made fun of him, said he looked like a choirboy in that outfit and that I would never let my parents force me to wear something like that, especially not a stupid bow tie. Now he\u2019s already super annoying because my parents borrowed his suit for me. I told him I\u2019d only wear it without the bow tie and without the vest. But I know he\u2019s gonna stalk my family\u2019s social media on Saturday, and if he sees a picture of me, I\u2019m done. He\u2019ll never let me live it down. He\u00b4s going to roast me for the next 10 years. My parents don\u2019t know that and I can\u2019t tell them, they are only getting annoyed with me. I told my parents that I just don\u2019t want to be in any photos at the wedding, but they say that would be rude and that I have to be in the photos. But why, I should be able to decide whether I want to be on photos or not?",

        "selftext": "^(Not that I think it will get to this point, but please don\u2019t reshare this on TikTok or YouTube shorts. I know my coworker watches those types of videos.) My (23f) coworker (21f) Millie has a very sweet and loyal boyfriend (21m) Luke. I don\u2019t know Luke very well, but he always picks us up from our hangouts (we\u2019re practically neighbors) and we even went to watch Dune 2 together as a trio. I\u2019ve gotten pretty close with Millie, since she\u2019s not local here and the three of us have a nice synergy whenever he picks us up from hangouts. All in all, I have a really great impression of Luke and they\u2019re very much a serious couple. I have another coworker (21f) Jessa that I also get along with just fine. Jessa and Millie started at the same time, so they\u2019re pretty close. They hang out together on their spare time and seem to share a similar type of humor. I was working with Jessa the other day and just to make time pass, I was telling her a story about two mutual friends of mine fighting over a guy. I made a comment in the lines of I don\u2019t understand why pretty girls go after ugly guys and without missing a beat, Jessa turns to me and says Oh, like Luke. She changed the topic before I even got to respond and I a minute later I told her I had to go do some paperwork. In the office, I ended up calling my best friend (who doesn\u2019t know these people) because I was kind of shaken by Jessa\u2019s comment. I asked her if I was overreacting for finding it so disturbing, and she told me I was (I later had a longer talk where she saw where I was coming from and agreed with me that the comment was very weird). To give some extra context, Millie has told me that when she first started seeing Luke, her close friends back at home used to shit on his appearance and tell her she can do so much better. Luke is by no means ugly, but Millie is drop dead gorgeous. Once they started being serious, they backed off and haven\u2019t made any more comments on him, especially because he treats her so well. With this in mind, I just felt Jessa\u2019s comment was completely uncalled for. I don\u2019t want to overstep because I know what type of relationship Millie and Jessa have (outside of work), so I don\u2019t know if this is their type of banter (though I highly doubt it). I think if I were in Millie\u2019s shoes, I\u2019d want to know, but I also don\u2019t want to cause trouble at the workplace. I also don\u2019t know if Jessa knows how sensitive Millie is about those types of comments. Jessa did once say that Millie is her ideal type and I\u2019m kind of cursing myself for letting my mind wander to that territory. Am I overreacting? I just feel like saying this about someone\u2019s boyfriend is weird, but it\u2019s even weirder when it\u2019s a coworker? And should I tell Millie or just leave it be? Jessa has said and done some other stuff that has made me annoyed in the past, but this just takes the cake. I feel a moral obligation to tell her, but I also feel like I'll save everybody some grief if I keep it between me and Jessa.",

On the way we picked up some of my friends from the movies to take them home, unfortunately we had agreed to pick them up before realizing that his little sisters 11f booster seat was in the back seat still.  My friend made a joke about sitting in it but my bf insisted that wouldn't be safe. So I moved it to the trunk.  Then today I went to see my bf at his house and his dad answered the door really upset.  Apparently he went to take my bfs sister to school today and saw that her booster seat wasn't where it usually is, he couldn't figure out where it was until he eventually texted my bf to ask if he knew. It took a few minutes for my bf to respond and tell him it was in the trunk, their dad unlocked the trunk and put her booster seat back in it's usual spot in the car.  The delay lasted about 15 minutes and made my bfs  sister late for school and their dad wasn't able to get an errand done before work like he had planned.  My bfs dad said it was very rude of me and my bf  to not put the booster seat back from where we moved it.  My bf is mad at me to because his dad lectured him about the importance of the booster seat and suggested he didn't care about his sister's safety at all, his sister overheard this and it really upset her, my bf wants to talk to her and tell her he loves her and cares very much about her safety but she won't let him in her room.

        "selftext": "My brother (48) passed away about a year ago - complications from alcohol addiction. He and his ex gf had a terrible and long relationship (10 years), in which she was cruel to me and my mother. They broke up, she threw him out, she took him back. We took him into out home to get him clean, and she came and picked him up. He got DUI\u2019s, we left him in jail to detox, she bailed him out. She refused to quit drinking and enabled his alcohol issues. She said they were in love, and other times she said he was a \u2018homeless guy\u2019 that lived with her.  My brother came to my house under hospice care, and given the animosity, I asked her not to come to my home. She did tell him goodbye at the hospital, and then screamed at me and my mother over his hospital bed because she blamed us for his issues. After my brother passed, my mother had him cremated and kept all of his remains. Immediately after he passed, I updated the ex and asked if he had any belongings at her house (he had family heirlooms, tools from my deceased grandfather, etc.) She told us she had thrown away his things and anything he had left was hers, since she had bought it.  Every other month, she sends me drunk messages demanding ashes and insulting me when I say no. She has never once expressed sympathy towards me or my mother.  I am done with the messages. I am thinking of getting a tiny urn and filling it with ashes from my cremated pets, and giving her that just to resolve the issue.

        "selftext": " Me (26 yo female) and my boyfriend (24 yo male) have been dating for 5.5 years. We are currently on vacation in Hawaii and to save some money for excursions and food we decided to rent a car through a more budget friendly place. The first car we received had a cracked interior and scratches and bumps on the exterior but ran and worked so we didn\u2019t think too much of it.  But then we started to notice some sounds that made us concerned that the bearings could be messed up or who knows what. So we asked the rental car place about it and they gave us a different car. This car was similar condition but it has the check engine light on. As soon we we noticed that, my bf said it\u2019s fine and we shouldn\u2019t worry about it. But I was concerned and encouraged him to please ask the rental car guy. So he reluctantly did and apparently all the rental car guy said was \u201cit\u2019s fine, but if it starts blinking on and off there\u2019s an issue so call us\u201d. I personally don\u2019t feel comfortable renting a car with a check engine light on, I don\u2019t care that it is a discounted rental car place, that doesn\u2019t mean that you should accept a car that has a check engine light on. But my BF used to work in a car shop years ago and he isn\u2019t concerned. I know that the check engine light being on could mean a myriad of different things from things that aren\u2019t concerning to things that can be a safety hazard. Personally, I am worried that while we are driving in an area without service (there are a lot of them) or when we are driving on the road to Hana or some narrow winding single lane trail with cliff edges and no guardrails, something is going to go wrong. He doesn\u2019t seem to be concerned about it and I am encouraging him to please drive us back to the rental car place and ask for a car without a check engine light on. He told me if I want a different rental car, he\u2019s not coming and I will have to go 30-45 min back to the rental car place by myself once we get back (even though we will be close to the rental car place on our way back to where we are staying). I truly think it is rude how he is not taking my concern seriously and is unwilling to switch out for a different rental car or at least ask them and telling me I have to do it (he is the one who made the reservation). He thinks I\u2019m entitled and that I\u2019m just upset I\u2019m \u201cnot getting my way\u201d. Am I the asshole? UPDATE: just thought I would let everyone know that my boyfriend agreed to ask the owner if he knew why the check engine light was on and if they have a different car for us to use. We went and the owner said he does not know why, and offered another car with a check engine light on. We kept ours for another hour or so, during which the seals on the front doors loosened so there was wind loudly on each side, there became an identified issue with the shifter in which we could not switch from reverse to drive and slid backward for a moment into oncoming traffic, and the whole area on the driver side holding the lock/unlock and window clickers pulled off when my bf closed the door. We asked for a refund which the owner gave us and rented a jeep through budget car rental.\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc",

We planned a huge brunch for our friends to ask them to be a part of our wedding party back in March of 2024. Everyone of course said yes, however, as time went on, a groomsman needed to back out so we needed to backfill the position to make it equal for our wedding party to walk down the aisle. Of course, it didn't bother me that my brother-in-law was not initially asked because my finance does have a lot closer friends that he has been friends with for years and we hang out with every weekend. When going over who my fiance was going to add to his side of our wedding party, he mentioned asking another friend of his, I told him it should be my brother-in-law and not his old best friend. Some background, my fiance and my brother-in-law are pretty close, we see him and my sister quite often as my sister is one of my best friends, and our kids (6) are the same age and hang out all the time. This friend that my fiance wanted to add to his wedding party was a really good friend of ours when we first started dating, he and his now finance were some of our best friends that we hung out with every weekend, however, we stopped hanging out with them both for about two years as the friend would make comments about me being a stay at home mom and living off my finance. Me and my fiance both agreed that I would be a stay-at-home mom while I finished college. Fast forward to today, we reconnected with our friends and after a serious apology from my fiance's friend we started to become a part of each other's lives, We only see them maybe once or twice a month, so I was confused as to why my fiance would want him in our wedding over my brother-in-law. I understand that they were best friends for years, and this is his side of the wedding party but my brother-in-law has always been there for us and never has done us wrong. So am I the asshole for asking my fiance to have my brother-in-law over his old best friend?",

        "selftext": "I (28F) live with my boyfriend (28M). I work a state govt job that keeps me out late while his job in IT is flexible so he works from home sometimes. We have been dating for a couple years now and recently he moved in with me. I bought the house and pay the mortgage for it entirely. My BF does not pay me any rent since he is currently in a low paying job and actively looking for better options. However he also has the longer commute to work so he pays more for gas now ever since he moved in because previously he lived closer to his workplace. Until he finds a new job, he told me he unable to contribute for the mortgage and hasn't asked to be on the deed either. He does however pay half the utilities and half of the groceries too. He has been extra conscious about not contributing to the mortgage or paying any rent. Since he doesn't pay rent, he tries to make up for it by doing almost all of the cooking for both of us. He also does the laundry and dishes most of the times without complaint. And when I ask him for help cleaning the house like mopping the floors, he helps with that too. He also packs my lunch every morning to save me the trouble of getting up early. I am really lucky that he does all of this. However, he does make a mess (kitchen and bathroom) and his cleaning isn't as good as when I would do it. We also buy a lot of groceries which we have nowhere to put since the house is somewhat small which makes the house a mess again. I didn't have this problem when I was living by myself so it has started to irritate me quite a bit over time. This past weekend, when he was cooking, he happened to drop rice and some sauce on the floor and hadn't cleaned up after so I told him you need to be more careful about dropping things on the floor cause you make a mess sometimes. It caused him to get upset and he started profusely cleaning the floors. Then he proceeded to tell me I know this is your house, but it feels like I need to tiptoe around you here because I am not keeping the place exactly how you want it. I make a mess sometimes but I always clean up after. Might not be immediately but I do get to it and I do my best. I'm sorry that isn't good enough. And this isn't the first time you've said this. He told me the other time this happened was when he was cleaning out our oven and while scrubbing the burnt bits, it dropped black spots all over the white floor which irritated me. And apparently I had told him that he didn't do a good job cleaning the floor one time when I had asked him to do it. After he told me all this, I got upset because and started crying and he spent the next hour consoling me. I am neurotic about keeping the place clean - especially my kitchen since I have had a rodent problem. Ever since this, I have always found him on all fours on the kitchen floor trying to find every last speck of food because I feel like he is convinced that I would get upset again. AITA for telling him he made a mess in the first place and wanting to keep my house clean? EDIT: Clarified being on the deed EDIT 2: I deleted all my replies to the comments because I kept getting downvoted on every single one. I don't understand the downvotes to my replies when I have only thanked the commenters, been civil with my replies and taken their suggestions as good ones and agreeing to make some changes in myself.

        "selftext": "I broke up with my ex three years ago, but I still had a teddy bear from him. I didn\u2019t take it with me when I moved to the city where I study, I left it at my mom\u2019s house. Since it was fluffy and comfortable, she started sleeping with it every night. After spending a year abroad, I came back to my hometown for a month. Every time I saw that teddy bear, it reminded me of my ex and the moment he gave it to me, so I decided to throw it in the fire without asking my mom. I didn\u2019t think she was that attached to it, I only considered that I didn\u2019t want anything from my ex in the house anymore. Three days later, my mom asked about the teddy bear. When I told her I had burned it, she got really emotional, even to the point of crying. She said she had slept with it every night for the past three years, that it was really comfortable, and that it helped calm her breathing and anxiety. I genuinely hadn\u2019t considered how much it meant to her. I told her I\u2019d buy her a new one, but I haven\u2019t been able to find the exact same one yet. AITA for burning it without asking her first? EDIT: It was not just the teddy bear that I threw, it were all the things I had home from him, and not because I am angry at him or not moved on, but I did not want to have them anymore. I only mentioned the teddy bear as my mom was attached to it, thing I was not aware of.",

We both even applied to a lot of top scholarship (QuestBridge, Gates, Coca-Cola, etc) and made it to finalist stages for QuestBridge together. In December, Jane matched to Duke University and only had to pay $10,000 over the course of four years. I did not get matched, so I did not receive the scholarship, but made finalist for the Gates Scholarship. This didn't tear our friendship apart but instead brought us closer--I was sad, of course, but I was happy for her. Fast forward to earlier today. She heard back from another big scholarship, and I told her to rescind her application as she already has QuestBridge. She did. Then, she heard back from another, and I told her, again, that she didn't need the money and to leave the opportunity for someone else who did. A couple hours passed, and she comes up to me asking for help with her essay, and I look at it with her. Then, she tells me that it was highly inconsiderate of me to tell her to rescind her applications, especially because I knew how much she needed it. At this point, I had taken two exams back-to-back, and was fed up w ppl. So I told her how it wasn't fair for people like me who didn't get matched, but deserved the money just as much as her. She then says how they have medical bills back from when her mom had cancer, and that it wasn't fair to her family that they pay for her school. I said that she could take a job, both during the summer and in college, so that they don't have to pay for her, but she stormed off. Now, I'm scared that I ruined our friendship, especially with something as small as this.  So, AITA?",

        "selftext": "GF has had two jobs these past three years. First job was through a friend of her father and the second job, I took my lunch break to go with her to apply. I literally had to motivate her in the car before she got the courage to walk in and apply. She suffers from anxiety and just the thought of applying to jobs is anxiety inducing. I can't count the number of times I have sent her places to apply online or we are walking past a restaurant with a hiring sign and she says she wants to apply and never does. This past summer we went again to apply for restaurant jobs and she broke down crying in the car because she was so overwhelmed. On another date she eventually was able to apply to a few. I walked with her along the way and kept my distance when she went inside. Unfortunately she did not get a call back. Months ago she told me that there was a restaurant close to her school that she planned to apply to but hasn\u2019t to this day. She got into a very prestigious academic program a couple years ago. Before that however, she lied to me about applying for a different program for months and only told me when she couldn\u2019t lie anymore. Last year I met the owner of a top firm in the field my girlfriend is studying and bragged about her and asked if she could email the owner with the hopes of getting an internship. I had to craft the email for her and she sent it off. I asked her a week after if she heard anything back from the owner and she said no which I found strange. It was only months later while in casual conversation that she admitted that the owner did message her soon after her email and she missed it and she didn\u2019t want to tell me because she was embarrassed. An opportunity at my workplace came up recently. We have spoken in the past about her working there and she said yes she would be okay working there as the money and environment is good. We had not been speaking for a couple weeks due to an unrelated issue so I decided to apply for her. I created an email and crafted a cover letter and resume and applied. The manager replied offering her an interview and I sent a screenshot to her asking if she was still interested. She said yes but then accused me of \u2018violating\u2019 her by doing what I did and also wondering \u2018what I else I could send without her consent\u2019. She is framing it as creepy and alarming. I feel like if she didn\u2019t have that history, for sure you can make that case but for her to act like I did without acknowledging her anxiety and past actions is deceitful and victimizing herself unnecessarily. It really took me by surprise and did hurt because I saw it as dishonest to frame what I was doing as such a big violation when she knows there\u2019s a whole recent history of her not being able to get jobs without help and avoiding applying for jobs. She has asked me in the past to help her draft stuff for her and help in applying for jobs so her framing what I did as something completely out of left field is disappointing. AITA?--",

My mom then started going on about how I need to go out with her if I wanted the ice cream, but I told her it was okay and didn\u2019t need it, it would just be nice.she would not accept that and started yelling at me at how I was loosing my independence and turning into a baby for not going out. she said \u201cyou are backtracking, I am coddling you and you\u2019re letting fear win.\u201d which no, I only asked her to get me food, and I\u2019m not just sitting around waiting for her to serve me. I make my food, do my dishes, laundry (with help occasionally), on my own. but those with severe anxiety/phobias understand its not something you can force someone to get over. to mention i have an ED based on fear of choking, so only eating liquid foods, and it\u2019s been this way for 2 years. She told me shes over this, and I NEED to go with her, and shes doing getting me food without coming. and then she told me I might need to live somewhere else because im \u201ctoo much work.\u201d (I only ask for 1 single kind of food from the store, and make it myself.)when she said that to me, I started crying because why would she want to get rid of me. since then, I\u2019ve been calling her by her first name because I lost all respect for her as a mom to me, and been generally avoiding her.but when I call her by her name, she says \u201cthat\u2019s not nice\u201d or, \u201cDon\u2019t call me that. i don\u2019t appreciate that.\u201d but I feel she doesn\u2019t deserve to be called my mom if shes just willing to get of me just because she\u2019s tried of my struggling. yes, I understand it can be difficult to have a child with many disabilities/issues. but AITA?",

We broke up a couple of times and came back together because I refused to let go and held on to him.Anyways, the last time we came back together before he proposed, I kind of pushed for it but it seemed like he felt what he had been doing was wrong and he said he was willing to change. Fast forward to getting married and living together, I contribute financially to the household. We both do. I do the cooking and the cleaning. He helps out with cleaning when he can. Sometimes when I clean he feels it's not up to his standard and starts cleaning again. Fair enough. A couple of days ago, the laundry was full and he put it in the washer and then asked why I didn't, then I said I was going to do it later. He then said, why didn't I do it then. I didn't say anything. We went to bed without speaking and on my way to work the next day, he called me after v texted during the night that I didn't th.. it's fair that he makes it out as if I don't do anything in the house. I then went on to say, I'm the one washing the toilets, doing the vacuum and although he puts the clothes in the washer, I have to pop them in the dryer and always did that and fold them back into the closet. He then went on to say it's not that I don't do them but I do them on my own time. But whose time would I do them on? I'm working. I do the chores on my off days cause I know that's when I'm free to cook and do cleaning.Then I said he should not help again then if he is going to keep complaining about the fact that he helps in the house and I told him to fuck off. Yeah maybe I was wrong for telling him to get off the phone but I think it's unfair to tell me to do the chores on his own time considering we both work. Even after night shift sometimes, I do the house chores",

        "selftext": "My partner and I recently started to live together at his place. He's been very accommodating and helped me feel at home ever since I moved in. There's one thing I feel we disagree on, and that's having company over every weekend.  When he was living alone he had a couple of good friends come over for drinks (nothing fancy, just catching up over a couple of beers) on a weekly basis, and he's the personification of my house is your house. They would raid the fridge, plop themselves on the couch and stay over well after midnight. They live with their parents and just like to be out of the house with every opportunity. Not an issue for me, but it's the main reason they like to come over instead of inviting us over to their place. I'm a very private person, I enjoy my own space and quiet time to decompress and relax on weekends. While I tried to also be accommodating and connect with his friends, the idea of having company and not being able to basically rot on the couch with just my partner is exhausting.  I talked to him about it and he said ok, we'll have them over when you feel like it. Thing is, I'm starting to never feel like it, it's almost a chore to me, I simply don't like people in my space. At the same time, I feel guilty about telling my partner not to have his friends over and socializing, as he's a lot more of a people person than I am.  Here's where I might be the asshole: my partner asked me to decide when to have them over because he doesn't want to impose and he wants me to be comfortable with it, so I texted them in advance and let them know we'd be having an early evening, instead of the usual. Once they left, my partner says he really enjoys their normal hangouts, and I was being antisocial for cutting it short.  We had a conversation about having people over every Saturday, and I suggested we compromise and maybe plan an evening out, have a few drinks and go back to our usual routine, at home. Or something along the lines of having them over once a month, instead of weekly. I don't want to deny my partner his need to be social and hangout with his friends, but since I'm now also living in the house, there needs to be some boundaries, and as much as I like his friends, I'm not always in the mood to share my space and not have  my quiet time for the sake of his bachelor days.",

We just moved into an apartment that is almost $1500 a month, both make about $3000 a month each, just had a baby girl a year ago, and are trying to save up for a home.  I got her a $200 cookware set and felt incredibly guilty getting the grill, as I grew up lower-class in a trailer and have never received a gift like this in my life. She saw my reaction and started crying, and I\u2019m trying to explain to her why we should return it because I want our main focus to be smart with our money right now, and I would never buy a grill like that for myself! I think because her dad is a grill-enthusiast she thought I would be head over heels for this thing.  I personally believe I could do just as good with a $200 charcoal grill, plus I\u2019m used to cheaper, smaller grills. I feel like an asshole telling her that I don\u2019t want the gift she obviously sacrificed a lot for, but I feel I will only use this thing maybe once a month and feel like an asshole having a brand new $1,000 grill while we just had a baby. I asked her not to give me a big gift anyways, if one at all.  Any more information I should leave here? Should I keep the grill and use it or return it so she can get her money back? AITA? ",

His place of employment has historically not been a positive place and has been the cause of deep stress for him and strain on our relationship; however, it was recently bought out so company ownership is different and this new position would be kind of a fresh start. He let me know about his new position after he accepted it yesterday. He said that he cares how I feel about it and that he knows it has been rough but he thinks this will be a good thing. I do have mixed feelings, but I am incredibly happy for him and proud and I let him know that. I let it sit and gathered my feelings about all of it and then tried to talk to him about it today. I told him that I am happy and excited for him and that I want to support him in this, want to ensure we respect each other\u2019s feelings, and communicate so we can move forward positively together. He lost it. He said that I hate his job and will never be happy, that he does not want to discuss it - ever -, that he should not have to be my therapist and talk to me about it\u2026 the list goes on. I repeatedly told him I am happy and that I am not upset or angry and that it was a conversation about moving forward with mutual respect and positivity and I did not understand why he was angry and asked if he could tell me what he is upset about so I can try and understand. He could not tell me and just kept saying he never wants to discuss it and that I just always cause problems and am never happy. I am at a loss. I told him I apologize if I miscommunicated somehow, but I literally just wanted him to know that I support him and that even though it has been tough there I want us to move forward supporting and respecting each other (that is the text I sent him verbatim). AITA here? ** update - the stress and strain I refer to is that he has been so stressed he has stopped taking care of himself, going to workouts (which he loves), being angry at everything and snapping at everything all the time. He knows he is doing that and apologize saying he is sorry and that he is just stressed and needs to find a new job because he can\u2019t take it, feels disrespected there, and feels terrible for taking it out on our family.

It\u2019s a very stressful environment for not being a stressful job because of my coworkers. I come home to try to just decompress to my fiance and now he\u2019s saying that my bad mood is to be expected everyday when I come home from work. He doesn\u2019t work at the moment and so our decompression of our work day aren\u2019t the same anymore it\u2019s just me complaining about my day but who genuinely.. who else am I supposed to talk to? I have friends all with their own problems with work and life stresses but I feel like that\u2019s the only person I SHOULD be able to talk to without shame. Everytime I begin to vent I\u2019m usually cut off with the same responses before I can even finishing venting. And I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m sitting here for HOURS venting about my day I\u2019m talking 20-30 minutes.. and I get told over and over how I need to find a new job when I already am. What am I supposed to do?",

        "selftext": "I, (19 M) Had to head out today in a three hour train ride. I prepared everything but noticed I couldnt find my charger. I had searched around the room and couldn't find any. Well I said no biggie, I will just take one from someone else. I was in a hurry and the closest room to mine is my mother's. on her shed I saw an unplugged charger. Now I will describe the charger a bit. It's a regular type c charger and that's it. No fast charging, nothing. I figured since it wasn't special in any way, I would borrow it. Its not like its the only one in the house but it was the closest. I took it and intended to send a message but it slipped my mind which I will admit was my fault.I didnt think about it too much until the way back when my mom called at me and screamed at me for taking the charger.I tried to tell her I couldn't find one in my room and that I was in a hurry but she had none of it and continued to scream at me. In the background I could hear my brother offering her literally multiple chargers and she refused, exclaiming that she wouldnt charge her phone with any charger other than hers. She screamed at me more before hanging up the call in my face and grounding me for a week. So reddit, AITA? EDIT: I read your comments and I can see how I was the asshole even after not thinking so intially. Thank you everyone for commenting.Do wanna clarify some things.  1. I did plan and had a bag ready and noticed it was missing when I woke up. I do admit I woke up later than I wanted to since I worked the nightshift. Atill doesnt justify taking a charger that wasn't mine. 2. It is VERY common for people in the house to borrow stuff without asking. I don't do it and the only time I did it was this. I guess that doesn't make me any better though since it aint fair to be mad at it and do it. Thank you everybody for commenting and I will do better <3",

Her dishes didn\u2019t have food on them but they still weren\u2019t washed. It had been nearly 4 days when I felt enough was enough and I called her to clean her things (I didn\u2019t see her in the flat during this period).

She paused, apologised and went \u201cwell if you really need the complete space, can you help me wash the dishes? It should be relatively clean too\u201d. This made me furious as why should I wash another person\u2019s dishes? I\u2019m not the cleanest, it took me some time myself to learn to clean after myself, so why am I expected here to clean someone else\u2019s mess? I told her how I\u2019ll give her until the next 3 days to clear up her mess.

        "selftext": " I 22(F) got a cat for my 19th birthday from my parents. He got out tonight while my dad had the window cracked because he is obsessed with going outside and learned how to push the window up. Everyone in the house knows this. My parents waited 30 minutes to tell me this. I have an anxiety and depression. My response when I heard this was of course crying and it lead to a panic attack. It was only for about 15 minutes and I collected myself but while I was having it my dad started screaming saying that he gets blamed for everything in the house. So a little context, my dad got injured at work and is now out of work because of this so he\u2019s been having a tough time. I never blamed either of my parents because this is not the first time Jax has gotten out but I knew in my heart of hearts this would be the last time. He was fighting with a cat that we suspected has rabies and logically with how long he was out there he was exposed, so we can\u2019t bring him back because it\u2019s too risky for us and my mom\u2019s cat. My mom said that I needed to stop being so dramatic in how I react to things because now my dad feels like I was blaming him, but I told her for not the first time that I have anxiety and tbh I collected myself pretty fast with no help from either of them. She basically was putting him before me when I was hurting because I knew he couldn\u2019t come home. I just feel invalidated even though I told my mom I didn\u2019t blame them and how they reacted was valid. Am i the asshole? Edit: as someone has said I was definitely wrong for not being more responsible and doing my enough research on how to take care of my cat. I\u2019m upset with myself for this. We never took our pets to the vet growing up and I thought he only needed the one shot and that was it because I was never told otherwise.  Update: he came home and Ive scheduled a visit to the vet. I checked him over and he doesn\u2019t seem to have any bite marks or scratches. He was checked over for fleas. The vet said even if he was exposed there is a low risk of anything because he has had the one vaccination. Keeping him away from my mom\u2019s cat for now. This was a very stressful situation especially since I have work today. He\u2019s mostly been under the blankets but has been fed and washed! ",

        "selftext": "I (20M) live with my roommate (27f), I'll just call her Vicky. Last year on Christmas I went to a party and got a bag of chips as a gift. I was planning on making those chips last a long time, at least until they expired, so I could eat them while watching movies and stuff. I came home one day to find that Vicky had used almost all my chips (I'd been able to eat like 5 or 6 before she got to them) to make an abomination of a meal that didn't even taste good. It looked like dog food. I'm not very confrontational, but the fact that she used my food in her cooking without establishing that it was okay with me. We have somwthing, not a rule, but something to that effect, in our kitchen that if something doesnt have a name on it, its free game, but I thought she would've thought to at least ask me to use them since it was a gift to me. It's a stupid thing to be hung up about, I know, but WIBTA if I just told her to stop using my food? Edit: I should've explained the whole policy thing better. It's not even that. It's literally just she said once that if food didn't have someone's name on it, it was fair game. However, this only seems to apply with other people's food, as other people who have visited have eaten her food and she's gotten upset over it.",

        "selftext": "Hi,Single mom here with two kids and an on again and off partner. He is currently unemployed and the primary caretaker of our children while I work an average of 10-12 hours a day. All bills are on me and most days I\u2019m overwhelmed but so is he with two rambunctious children. In our old home he had a job but never contributed to bills and instead did fun things with the kids like pay for museum tickets and the zoo etc so I didn\u2019t mind. This month things are really tight, our eldest needed braces (she\u2019s under 10 y/o) and that was an unexpected expense. Anyway, when we moved into the house- the old tenants left a tv mount above the fireplace. The previous owner told us that it\u2019s difficult to remove because this is an old house with sensitive walls. After living here for about a month and a half my partner (without consulting me) decides to take down the wall mount. Ok- no problem\u2026 but he tells me he won\u2019t fill in the massive holes tonight. I ask when then? He storms off and doesn\u2019t say a thing. I already feel bamboozled with this house, so many things have broken and I\u2019ve been paying for them to be replaced or repaired. To hear, that a perfectly fine mount was removed for absolutely no reason is gut wrenching, especially after the repair costs I\u2019ve had to endure. Now I\u2019ve hired a task rabbit who will arrive in a few days to fill/sand/and paint this atrocious hole situation.  my partner is mad that I am paying for this. The last project at the previous house included building a cat corridor and dragging giant pieces of wood across my laundry room walls and never fixing it.  I know financially it isn\u2019t the best time to pay for ANOTHER repair so I feel like an asshole, however, I don\u2019t think I should feel that way because I was so excited for this home and it\u2019s already been a pain without my partners shenanigans. tldr; partner put holes in the walls by removing the TV mount without discussion and is mad that I\u2019m paying for the repair because \u201che\u2019ll get around to fixing it\u201d am I the asshole?   Am I the asshole for paying a handyman?",

        "selftext": " My boyfriend (2 years) has a tendency to say extremely problematic things from time to time with me, in front of our friends, on social media etc. and I have a tendency to correct him (non condescendingly) Usually when he says them, half of the time he starts to realize what he\u2019s saying midway and then ends his statement with \u201cyeah I should learn more about this before I say anything.\u201d It\u2019s usually about a left leaning topic such as trans rights or feminism, the patriarchy etc.  For some context on why this is relevant or important is because we both work in the same field and we deal with these kinds of topics a lot.  While most of the times he is receptive to hearing out why what he says is problematic, he also sometimes \u201cchooses\u201d not to be as sensitive or open-minded, and gets angry at me for telling him that what he\u2019s saying is coming off wrong.  I understand that it\u2019s also exhausting to be wrong about things all the time and I hate correcting him too. I just do it so he doesn\u2019t say the same thing in public. Usually I try not to make a big deal of it, and add in a quick line like \u201coops u should say it like ___ if that\u2019s what u mean\u201d or \u201chey u should reconsider that.\u201d  I can understand why is comes off bad but I really don\u2019t know how to let him just go around saying those things either.  We both have had many discussions on how we will never blame anyone for their thoughts on something, and as long as they are willing to be open to another pov, they\u2019re not \u201cwrong.\u201d This is because it\u2019s extremely common in our country to have crazy opinions straight out of school because of the family backgrounds of people strongly influence the way they think. Anyway getting to yesterday, he said that people who don\u2019t understand our field of work are not classy, and to that I responded that it\u2019s classist to look down on people for not understanding something just because you do.  He got really mad at me for calling him classist, and I told him multiple times that I didn\u2019t call him classist, I called his choice of words and sentence classist.  It (in my opinion) got heated up for no reason when he could have just been like \u201coh didn\u2019t see it like that oops.\u201d At some point he finally apologized and then he called me a \u201cbitch\u201d for making him feel bad??? and compared me to someone that I really don\u2019t like.  I told him that\u2019s not ok and then the argument got even more heated and finally I told him I\u2019m not going to take his shit anymore and finally he said  \u201cI\u2019m sorry for being transparent with you. I\u2019m not going to talk to you for a few days. I\u2019m sorry for calling you hateful things, I need to change my personality, I\u2019m going to change, so that no one gets hurt anymore\u201d I tried to stay as calm as I could during the entire argument and I really do understand why he\u2019s upset. But I have no idea if I should stop or not. He has told me multiple times that I make him a better person so.  AITA?  EDIT: I would like to clarify a few things that are being debated in the comments. His problematic statements are NOT normal in our field of work, but ARE normal by common people in the place that we live. Some examplea of things he's said are trans women are a problem because they're just men who want to win the olympics in the women's category and Women do have equality they just want more thats why they keep saying they dont",

I had asked my boyfriend why he wasn\u2019t taking me out on dates anymore, and he explained that he just was busy with work and everything and bummed out. In the beginning, we would go on dates all the time, he would shower me with nice gifts, and make me feel like a princess. I hoped up, reminiscent of those times, and proposed a date idea, but he instantly shut it down, saying he was tired. I just dropped it after that, and he said we should order takeout. I said no, because I wasn\u2019t in the mood for takeout, and takeout seemed so cheap and thoughtless at that moment. Then he offered a park date, and even though that wasn\u2019t really what I wanted, I obliged. We walked for a bit and I was just instantly bored, but he seemed pretty happy the whole time, (In hindsight I get it now :/) but I didn\u2019t mind that. We walked to a nice sunset area and sat down. I started to enjoy it then as we talked about plans and the near future.And then out of nowhere, he asked what I thought about marriage. I told him I was definitely on board with marriage, and got to picturing the life we had married, and I started to wonder if maybe he wanted to propose, and that got me excited too. I was just imagining the pretty big gem on my finger and I was ecstatic just thinking about it. Then we left, and he stopped me. I looked back and he was on his knee, holding a box. I started to get very excited and jump and squeal\u2026 until he opened the box. There in the box, was the most pathetic, tiny ring with an even more pathetic tiny diamond. I was floored. My face just dropped, and I stood still. He looked at me, and said, \u201cWould you marry me?\u201d and I just shook my head lifelessly and walked away. I walked around, upset that he had just embarrassed me like that, with such a ring. He\u2019s called me numerous times to try and find me, but to be honest, that small ring just wasn\u2019t gonna cut it. I\u2019m thinking about breaking up with him because now I know he can\u2019t afford the lifestyle I want. We haven\u2019t really spoken much since, and I honestly don\u2019t feel like being with him anymore, what should I do?",

        "selftext": "My boyfriend and I have been dating for a few months now, and things are going really well. We share a lot of common interests, and even when we differ, we enjoy learning from each other. We\u2019ve also set some boundaries, like keeping PDA to just holding hands and not bringing up each other\u2019s pasts unless it\u2019s mentioned first by said party. However, there's one small thing that really bothers me, even though it\u2019s not really that big of a deal. I get really anxious about phone calls. Whenever my phone rings, I instantly think there\u2019s something urgent or serious going on. I\u2019ve talked to my boyfriend about it, and while he\u2019s the opposite and loves calling people (since he thinks it\u2019s quicker and more personal than texting), I\u2019ve asked him to text me before calling if it\u2019s just for a casual conversation. This way, I can relax, knowing it\u2019s not an emergency, and decide if I\u2019m available to talk. It\u2019s also helpful because if I\u2019m in the middle of something, I can either finish what I\u2019m doing or let him know I\u2019ll call him back later. When he calls without texting first, I get stressed, and I don\u2019t like letting it go to voicemail because I worry something\u2019s wrong. And thus, no matter what I\u2019m doing, I will always stop everything to answer a call. A quick text helps me calm down. And don\u2019t get me wrong\u2026 I\u2019d love to hear him on the phone. Just, a text first would be nice. Recently, he called me without texting first, but it was for an emergency, so I didn\u2019t mind. However, since then, he\u2019s continued calling without texting, and while he apologizes when it happens, it still bothers me. I don\u2019t want to say anything because he\u2019s still dealing with said emergency that happened earlier, but I\u2019m starting to feel upset. I\u2019m unsure if I should just let it go since 1) its not a big deal, and 2) it\u2019s part of his character to call instead of text, or if I should ask him to change this for me. It\u2019s a small thing, but it\u2019s starting to weigh on me a bit. AITA?",

        "selftext": "Ok folks I'll be honest, this is incredibly low stakes and more to prove a point than anything else. The long and short of it is my husband asked me to turn off the lights after I laid down. We're on vacation, it's currently about 09:00 in the morning, and I'd turned the light on to read something on the computer as I don't like using my laptop in the dark.  After I sat back down on the couch next to him, he suggested I get some more sleep as I hadn't slept well. I agreed, laid down, and that's when he asked me to get the light. He couldn't because our infant daughter fell asleep on him, and we know if we move her within 30 minutes of falling asleep she'll wake up and be super crabby. As I was getting the light, I lightly accused him of AH behavior. My reasoning? He didn't say anything while I was sitting up, or even by my computer. He argues that because I left the light on, I'm the AH for wasting electricity. I then told him if it went up here, he'd be labelled the bigger AH and he said prove it. So here I am.  AITA for leaving a light on? Quick ETA: ok y'all, I hear you. I definitely came here full of bluster. I acknowledge calling him names was petty and childish, it's just how we've always played. Regardless, I should've just gotten the light after I was done and I've already promised him apology nachos. I made sure to send the link to my husband, and he and I have taken turns reading the answers. Respectful/neutral ones we just nod and agree with, more biting ones make us laugh. He says thanks for sticking up for dads!",

        "selftext": "AITA Hey so i\u2019m a 19 F dating my 21M boyfriend. We do not live together, however we often go over to each other\u2019s houses. When I go over to his place, I often will buy groceries and cook supper and do other things of the like. I\u2019m usually pretty good for picking up after myself, but I will admit I forget the odd thing. My boyfriend is very bad at picking up after himself and his house is often a disaster. Instead of owning up to his mess, he looks for the odd thing i\u2019ve left out and claims that I need to clean up his similar mess as well. For example, if I use a dish and forget to wash it, he insists that ALL of the dishes (including the large piles of dishes he leaves all over the counter) are now solely my responsibility to wash. I do not live with my boyfriend, and so I do not think it is my responsibility to pick up after him all of the time. I don\u2019t mind helping out here and there, especially if we are doing something together. But he will be sitting on the couch on his phone and ask me to do something for him so he doesn\u2019t have to get up.  I reached my breaking point when I was at my own home and he had sent me a photo of his garbage can that was slightly overflowing and claimed that \u201cyou need to take out your garbage\u201d. The garbage can was 95% full of his belongings, with my empty drink container on top. I simply responded and said that it wasn\u2019t my responsibility to take out his garbage as it was his own. He got mad and insists that because I \u201ctopped up\u201d the garbage I should take it out. Normally I would swallow my pride and just take out the garbage because it isn\u2019t a big deal, but it feels like this is just the start to having to pick up after him in his own home. He has started to leave his garbage full and leave things on the counters so when I put my garbage in the full can, it\u2019s all of the sudden my responsibility to take it out because I\u2019m the one who \u201ctopped it up\u201d. He thinks I\u2019m being unfair, and that if I\u2019m \u201cmaking a mess\u201d of his home the least I can do is take out the trash from time to time. If i start solely taking out the trash, I fear this will escalate until I end up doing all of this chores for him.  Am I the asshole for refusing to take out the garbage? I need a third party to tell me if I\u2019m being crazy before problems escalate between my boyfriend and me.",

To be clear I been with him for 5 years. I know I might be young but hearing the words I don't want to marry you did hurt. My issue is AITAH for fighting custody of my daughter so I can join the military? Ps he doesn't work at all so I'm financially support my daughter n I live with my parents n he lives with his. He does come every two days to see his daughter but he is in the phone most of the time and yells at my baby a lot. I know going to a legal battle for my baby's custody would mean a end to the relationship but not sure if it's worth it anymore ? Help !!",

I was assigned a computer with administrator privileges, so I can monitor the other computers in the lab. One day, I noticed that my classmate was playing a game on their computer. Since we\u2019re not supposed to be doing that, I decided to check on it using my admin privileges to confirm if they were actually playing a game or if I was just imagining it. When I checked, I saw that they were indeed playing a game, so I decided to mess with their computer to let them know they were breaking the rule. I didn\u2019t delete anything or do anything too extreme, but I did interfere with their work. Afterward, my classmate reacted to what I did, but they didn\u2019t say anything specific. They didn\u2019t seem upset or anything, so I figured it wasn\u2019t a big deal. I thought maybe they were just brushing it off. Later, I told the teacher that my classmate was playing a game on their computer. The teacher responded by saying that they were actually looking at their presentation. That\u2019s when I realized that what I thought was a game was actually part of their presentation. At that point, I felt really guilty because I had messed with something that was important to them, and I didn\u2019t even realize it at the time. I know I was trying to follow the class rules, but I feel like I might have overstepped. I didn\u2019t mean to mess up their presentation, but I still feel bad about it.

He passed away a couple years ago, but there was no love between my parents since I was young - mostly due to the distance and the financial troubles we were in, she blamed him for the lack of support and I grew up hearing them fight constantly. It\u2019s a bit complicated but they remained married still until his passing.

She TEXTED me I don't feel anything for you like someone in a romantic relationship would. I think our relationship changed and i lost feelings.  I tried to understand why she lost feelings, asked her what she wanted to do. Take a break? End things completely? She would ALWAYS tell me i dont know.  Every question i asked her she would say that she didnt know. We were in this situation for like 3 days, i wanted answers, a reason why she wanted to leave me, what she wanted to do from here, but i got none.  Eventually i got fed up and told her I need an answer, you cant just fool me around, i deserve to know what you want to do and why you wanted to do it.  Mind you, this is all over text... we live 20 min away from each other but okay. She finally said she wanted to break up because she thinks no one can re-gain feelings for someone which i dont agree but thats not the point. Now that you have a backstory: would I be the asshole if i asked her for some expensive gifts i gave her?  I spent a lot of my money that I made working my ass off in sound and music production. I don't have a stable job, just little ones that i get offered from time to time because im also in college full time.  I gave her a lot of plushies and sylvanian families that she loves, which cost a lot of money... so i kinda want to ask for them back so i can sell them. I dont know if this is an asshole move.

My father left my home several years ago, and my mother is a housewife, so I'm the breadwinner of the family. I work as an artist who makes commissions for others. A couple months ago, I found this girl (19f) on a shared Discord server and friended her. I introduced myself, showed her a couple of my art pieces, and asked her if she wanted to submit a commission so that I can make her something. She said she wasn't sure and wanted some time, which I respected. A couple days later I sent her another message and she said that she wasn't interested. I got desperate since I was struggling financially so I told her about my circumstances and asked her to help me. She was sympathetic and commissioned me. We started talking after that. I told her about my goal at the end of the month and she promised to help me. I said I wanted to try myself first. I learned that she was saving up for college and to move out of her parents' home. A month later, I reminded her of the promise she made. She told me that she was saving up, so I told her to just send me a fraction of that. I asked her for some financial support a few more times, whether to help me with a company idea, or because my brother was being hospitalized, and she did. Last month, I found out that one of my close friends (17f) who was also low-income had a getting hospitalized from a life-threatening condition. I was worried about her and wanted to help, so I told her about my online friend. After that, I texted the online explaining the situation and asked her to send some financial support. She said no, saying that she as much as my life sucked, I can't just keep asking money from her, since she also needed it for college and rent, and she can try to help me with finding some options but to stop asking her. I got pretty desperate because I wanted to help my friend, so I pleaded with her. In the end, she said that this would be the last time that she'd do this and sent it. Today, I tried my online friend but I found out that I was blocked. I still had her Discord, so I made a new account and tried to text her. When I told her who I was, she told me to leave her alone. I was shocked, because she's normally very sweet and kind, so I asked what happened. She explained that her parents found out and got mad at her, and she already told on a few different occasions that she was uncomfortable with sending me money, especially since she barely knew me, and made her feel like she was a bad person for feeling that way. I tried to apologize and promised that I wouldn't do that again, but she didn't trust my word and blocked me. I felt awful and explained to my mother what happened. She told me that while what I intended to do was good, I can't just ask people to share their money with me. So I'm just wondering, AITA?",

Few minutes later He got Up and went Out. He got a device to calm the Baby and went to the toilet. I immediately told him angrily, that If He was awake and got Up, He could have taken the Baby and let me Go to the toilet First! Then an Argument arose. He says, He can't ready my mind and I should Tell him exactly what I need. I know I have to Work on telling my needs, and I still think He could have known what I needed,since I was so clear in saying I have to pee.

        "selftext": "For the past two or three years, my roommate and I (both of us are 22M) watch over his nephew (5M) when his mother's at work. Said nephew is obsessed with this Kidoodle app, which contains stuff such as Ryan's World, Baby Shark and Like Nastya. This is something that, while the roommate does find annoying, he otherwise doesn't mind since he's always busy with game modding. However, I've been noticing as of late that it appears the brainrot he's been watching is having a noticeably negative impact on his behavior, especially in school. And I feel like that it's also what's causing his speech learning delay. I had enough of this after a while, so earlier today, I decided to uninstall the Kidoodle app from the TV, and I told him that it had shut down, meaning that those shows were gone forever. Needless to say, he *COMPLETELY* lost it. But I feel that it's for the best. Haven't heard from said roommate yet, as he's been out and about today, but I'm really not sure how he's going to react. So, my question is. Am I the asshole for lying to my roommate's nephew?",

I have even paid 500 dollars today for her accommodations and also much more earlier, which I am not counting btw. The most important thing is I dont feel that much connected to her although because she has gone through a terrible past I have a very soft corner for her that way and I cant hurt her. Now, in the concert there will be my other lady friends some of whom my GF has issues with, you know jealousy and all at no fault of mine btw. I am not at all concerned if anyone is going to be there except for a good platonic friend of mine. I really want to enjoy the show but for some reason I am feeling bad because I am not taking her. I have got an understanding that I have the right to be an asshole sometimes, but I cannot decide whether this is the right time or not. ",

Fast forward to now and we are empty nesters. I still work, I have my own business I'm growing for the last 5 years. My wife takes care of the home. Our youngest child came home to handle some health issues.  My wife took him to the hospital for an out patient cardiac procedure that took all day.  Here's where I might be the AH. I work from home, specifically in the lounge in our building. During the day when my wife and kid was at the hospital, I took a work break. I went upstairs, made myself lunch, then went back to work downstairs. I left the pots and dirty dishes in the sink. So when my wife came home late from the hosipital with our kid still in pain from the procedure, she came home to the dirty dishes.  But washing dishes is her job, that was our arrangement.

Over the last year and a half, we\u2019ve had constant issues with and disagreements over communication and it\u2019s been having a very negative impact on our relationship. For context I am autistic, and she has been aware of this from the beginning of our relationship. She\u2019s knows that I have difficulty with implied meanings/hints/subtext, and to properly communicate with me effectively she needs to use clear unmistakable language. Last month we had another disagreement over a prior conversation we had via text. She claimed that she had asked in said conversation for me to go buy some groceries for a dinner we were planning to make together, and I told her that I would go to the grocery, but she never asked me before that moment. She got upset and repeated that she had, and I responded saying that we had the conversation via text and she in fact had not asked me. At that point she shut down and went to get the items herself.  Following this incident, we had another face to face conversation, and she mentioned showing the previous text conversation to her sister and a friend to see if she was in the wrong, and said they both agreed with her. I considered doing the same and asking my friends, but I know that they\u2019d just co-sign whatever I said, and so I\u2019m here with a throwaway for unbiased opinions. Including a copy paste of the previously mentioned text conversation since attachments aren\u2019t allowed.

Simple question got a huge defensive response. Context: i dont know where my parents, grandparents, friends are born either. All of them have moved from their birthplaces. I have a bad memory for birthdays, i know his and my best friends because they share one. My dad and my nan because they one. Im totally clueless for all my friends except for the months.

She had her big birthday 4 day ski trip cancelled because of weather and is pissed because she had been planning it for a while. She made a big deal out of it because in her eyes she never got to celebrate anything. We went for a meal and karaoke but she didn\u2019t feel like it was enough of a celebration.  Tbh our family isn\u2019t big on celebrating anything but my sister kind of brought it on herself. My sister put a lot more pressure on herself when she was younger because everyone told her she was a genius. She skipped grades and graduated high school at 16. She didn\u2019t attend prom because she was younger than the other students so even though she was a senior she hung out with student her own age more so she didn\u2019t have friends to go with. Plus if I remember correctly she had AP exams afterwards so she spent that night studying because at that point she needed an A in every subject. She always says it was her biggest regret in life. Our parents didn\u2019t put that on her she was just over the top back then. I think it\u2019s overblown because she is very successful now in a job that\u2019s hard to get into so it\u2019s not like her hard work wasn\u2019t rewarded. Tons of people work hard without much to show for it which is worse.   She was complaining to me constantly about her 30th being ruined and said she only has her wedding to look forward to now (she isn\u2019t engaged yet but probably will be this year). I told her she shouldn\u2019t put so much on the wedding and it\u2019s just an expensive party which she can afford yes but it\u2019s still a lot to be putting on a single day. She said it\u2019s her last chance to celebrate something and all the achievements she had has been pushed aside to make room for the next thing and she wants her wedding to be memorable like her 30th was suppose to be but in a good way. She mentioned again skipping prom as an example and I told her that skipping prom to study is kind of a humble brag but more so it\u2019s not a big deal. I went to prom and honestly it wasn\u2019t that interesting, I get she missed it and it sucks but she has way better things in life rn. She got mad and said I got a lot more things celebrated than her so I don\u2019t understand what it\u2019s like to go back and realize there isn\u2019t even a single photo of the event. I\u2019ve texted her a few times since and she just replies with one word answers and I just wonder if she\u2019s overreacting or I\u2019m the asshole here. ",

On top of that, each of us has saved around $3,000 from birthday money saved for future expenses (such as university) I\u2019m considering withdrawing my $2,600 so that if our dad\u2019s money ever runs low, I won\u2019t have to dip into my own hard-earned cash.

By the way, my dad works extremely hard to get us into private schools and pay houses. He also owns a few small companies, and sometimes he needs to borrow money.  However, I would say we are decently well off and my two brothers recently got the IPhone 16 Pro Max (I didn\u2019t get one, but he offered to one day get me an MacBook to make it even).

My cousins started leaving me out and i was low-key getting pissed off but i didn't say anything. We all went outside for a walk and when i came back into the driveway, my mom was there, smoking a cigarette. My mom noticed that something was wrong with me. She started interrogating me and trying to coax an answer out of me. I start crying out of distress because she kept berating me about something that didn't even happen. She leaves me alone for a bit and promises we'll leave as soon as she gets all the tupperware. I was in the car trying to calm myself. Once I do that, i go back inside expecting to see my mother ready to go. She explains that my Aunt was in the shower and wanted my mom to stay. I just said whatever and went back upstairs. Everyone around her was drunk and I was nervous at the thought my mom would also get drunk and try to drive me home. I also just really don't like drunk adults, they scare me (this also connects to the fact that last time everyone was drunk there was a fight and my uncle got hurt.) . I go upstairs for about another hour. I walk down the steps and peak my head over to peer at my mom who was sitting at the table. She was drinking out of a plastic cup and i felt my heart drop to my stomach. There was also a beer bottle sitting on the counter. She reassured me earlier that she was drinking Pepsi but my anxiety was taking no mercy at the time. I calmly walk upstairs to the bathroom and pace back and forth for a while. I pace up and down the steps, peering over once again. I just decide to go outside and talk my anger out. I go outside and grab a random box and bend it and kick it. It didn't help. I walk back in the house with everyone in the kitchen staring at me (probably because i was acting like a fucking lunatic). I go back into my cousins room to calm myself. after about 30 minutes i get impaitent and go to peer over the stairs again. they were all still drinking and my mom promised we'd leave 2 hours ago. I begin pacing again, scream into a pillow, and then i start feeling like i cant breath. so i run downstairs telling my mom i cant breath and she's acting like it's nothing (probably because i've embarrassed her enough). She then finally decides to go and i get yelled at from the moment we walked out the door to the minute we get home. I understand it was bratty and i still get her snarky comments about it from time to time. I think i'm the asshole. I just wanted to get this off my chest.",

I\u2019m not just going to throw the games out or donate them I play video games to and I know some of these are still pretty valuable for collectors.

I\u2019m 33F and sibling is 37NB  Also in our state anything left past 30 days can be considered abandoned. Edit for some Q and A:  Time frame: last time I asked was in September and specifically asked them to take them when they came down for Christmas because I would need the space after.Sibling was down for 3 days for Christmas and didn\u2019t box them up and take them Why haven\u2019t I boxed them up?: at the time they weren\u2019t in the way plus it\u2019s a shelf with a glass door and keeps them all safe. Some of my stuff is in there too Why I won\u2019t box them up and send/take them: I\u2019m not our mother nor am I paying for shipping and I know sibling won\u2019t.And I should not have to clean up after an adult for nothing. For context I\u2019m 33F sibling is 37NB. Distance/Visits: Sibling lives only like 40 minutes to hour away (depends on traffic/weather) and we usually see each other twice a month possibly more and we flip on who goes to who\u2019s house Why I need the space: I got a new bigger T.V and I needed a new entertainment center for it, old one was big with lots of storage space for games/blu-rays the new one only has about 1/3 the storage of the first",

Tonight I was watching him play, he plays on console and while he got into a firefight he was shooting the ground for half his clip so I made fun of him a bit. It was just a basic joke like \u201cLol he\u2019s shooting the ground\u201d. But my dad was in a motorcycle accident years ago and lost a lot of the mobility in his left hand because of it, so he has trouble playing on the controller. I wasn\u2019t thinking about this at the time, just poking fun because he was shooting the ground for a long time. My family often rips into me during gaming so I thought it would be ok. But he replied with these exact words, \u201cShut the fuck up. I\u2019m sick of you. It\u2019s already unenjoyable to play with you.\u201d  I didn\u2019t even know what to say, I just went silent and left the room. I feel like he must have been very upset and hurt to react in the way that he did.  He had previously been saying that it sucks that he mostly plays alone now so I\u2019ve been playing with him whenever I can. I don\u2019t actually like Fortnite anymore, so I play just for him, but now I\u2019m wondering if I\u2019m actually just being a burden on him and actually very unfun to be around whenever I\u2019m on Fortnite.  I just recently received an ADHD diagnosis and I\u2019m grappling with feeling worried that people hate me and that I\u2019m annoying, to hear my dad say that definitely hurt. I also just lost a bunch of friends due to things that I didn\u2019t even realize were issues until it was too late. So this really solidified me feeling that my behavior is not OK to others but I don\u2019t know how to fix it. I don\u2019t know how to act in a way that is perceived positively by him.  I know that his limited mobility is hard for him but I didn\u2019t know it was such a sore spot regarding the aim, now I feel extremely guilty and sad that I hurt his feelings. AITA? How should I apologize?  I\u2019m 18F ",

I agreed, despite not being entirely sure if I wanted that, especially since it\u2019s typically pretty pricey. She decided to invite our two coworkers, who I alongside today. I was talking to them, and expressed that I didn\u2019t actually care for the idea of getting seafood. They agreed, and we all said we should suggest to her that we want KBBQ instead. We did this, and even held a \u2018vote\u2019 in the group chat as a joke over which we would prefer (seafood vs KBBQ). Our friend ultimately shut it down and I picked a seafood restaurant for us to go to. She then later texted us that she no longer wanted to go, she said \u201cI don\u2019t like the way ya\u2019ll made me feel about wanting to stick to the plans we made.\u201d I apologized, and me and the others explained we didn\u2019t really care where we ate, as long as we were having fun.

We\u2019ve been together for 2.5 years, but financial struggles and legal issues are making it impossible to afford our current place. It\u2019s devastating\u2014I feel like a failure, and talking about it is really hard. I also have severe ADHD, making emotional regulation difficult. On top of that, I\u2019ve been sick for 10 days, unable to work, and completely drained. Despite knowing this, my mom only wants to talk about finances. I get that she\u2019s worried, but she keeps pushing the conversation despite my repeated boundaries. I physically can\u2019t talk\u2014I lost my voice from coughing so hard I\u2019ve been throwing up. I\u2019ve told her this, yet she keeps bringing it up. I\u2019ve lost nearly 15 pounds from being sick and have begged her to stop, but she won\u2019t. Tonight was the last straw. My fianc\u00e9 is also sick and acting like a big baby about it. I reached my breaking point and snapped at him, but he apologized, realizing I\u2019m just as sick. We\u2019re now resting together, trying to recover. Before that, I considered going to my mom\u2019s for support. I called her, crying, barely able to speak, and she immediately started talking about finances again. I lost it and sent this text: All week, you\u2019ve pushed to talk about finances because I was too sick for our meeting. I am still too sick. If you were this sick, you wouldn\u2019t want to discuss finances and feeling like a failure. If I kept pushing a topic you repeatedly asked me to drop, you would have a meltdown. I\u2019ve been actively breaking down for three days, yet you keep ignoring my boundaries. This is no longer concern\u2014it\u2019s blatant disrespect. I have so many texts where I\u2019ve politely asked you to stop, explaining that I cannot physically or mentally handle this while I am sick and miserable. Right now, I would rather be homeless than live in a house where my boundaries are ignored. This is so upsetting, and I needed to say it because you aren\u2019t listening. Goodnight. Was I too harsh?

        "selftext": "So me (18M) and my girlfriend (18F) has been together a just over a year now, and we both have eachothers phone passcodes. Early on in the relationship I've established that I don't agree with obsessing with celebrities or saving videos of someone you find attractive on social media if you have a partner - she agreed and didn't have a problem with this. A couple times however I've found her doing this. One time she thought I was asleep, she was on her phone and I saw she had a bunch of thirst traps saved (all of the same actor). When I pretended to wake up she deleted them as quick as she could which I found very odd, because now it seems she's trying to hide it. That was half a year ago, but yesterday whilst she was sleeping, I went on her Tiktok. Initially I went on it to troll a mutual friend of ours, I was going to send them a silly message but then I saw that my girlfriend had been sending this friend thirst traps of that same actor from before saying things like Silent repost because my boyfriend would be upset or I fear I would fall for this man but don't tell my boyfriend I said that. I felt so disrespected because she's actively trying to hide it, and this is something she KNEW I would be upset by. Anyways, I then went through her favourited videos and as I thought, a bunch of thirst traps and edits of the same guy over and over again. I know people are going to say You violated her privacy, you clearly didn't trust her in the first place but we've given eachother our passcodes so I don't think it's that problematic, she could've gone through my phone too. Let me know if that's a wrong way of thinking. I confronted her and she smiled and laughed and said you've made yourself sad now why would you do that. She saw I wasn't happy and changed her demeanor, and said she didn't know what to say. We talked and I said how I felt betrayed, she crossed a boundary and how I thought it was disgusting that she was fully aware she was doing something I wasn't comfortable with and tried to hide it. We didn't get into an argument, we were laying in bed saying things individually, taking long pauses to think of what to say, no shouting just calm discussion. When she got home, her parents asked why she was upset and she told them the situation but her parents are very angry at me for going through her phone in the first place, and said that I didn't trust her. She also texted me saying she also thought the same thing but didn't want to tell me when we were hanging out because she didn't want to make the situation worse. I haven't told her I wasn't even planning on going through her phone in the first place but rather just wanted to troll that friend of ours. I know that I should've just left it at that and ignored the videos she sent, rather than going through her favourites. I just want opinions on the situation, am I the asshole for having gone through her phone, or am I right in saying she's in the wrong for having crossed a boundary?",

        "selftext": "I am a female thats still in HS. Am i a pos for making fat jokes to them? It started when we would just go and joke around about our appearances and whatever. It didn't offend me at all. I called them fat (okay fatty haha) in a joking way and I was assure that they knew I was joking- and I never meant to ACTUALLY bring them down on purpose.  I was always made fun of for my appearance and my looks and all that shit when I was in elementary up until now. I thought that it was normal to make fun of it. But- I never actually meant it if I did make comments. I would only do it if my friends started making fun of each others appearances.  I found out recently from one of my friends that is apart of this friend group that the girls were upset and uncomfortable by these Jokes. I texted her and told her I understood and i wouldn't make these jokes anymore. So since i was at home at the time, I texted both of the girls I hurt. I apologized to one and they accepted my apology. (Im aware apologies dont fix everything and I still left that person hurt.)  But Then i go and text the second girl I have yet to apologize to and I found out she blocked me weeks ago. Even though I never actually said those fat jokes directly to her, she still blocked me. I feel like a Pos.  Mind you, Im very aware that I tend to not think before I speak a lot of the times and I reassured them to tell me if I say anything that hurts their feelings. But I just found out that they were uncomfortable with letting me know. So that makes me feel like an even bigger pos.  ive apologized, ive done everything I can to assure that ive realized my mistake but I feel like they dont want to be friends with me anymore.  I grew up with barely any friends, always one or two, or none. So losing friends makes me very emotional.  ",

        "selftext": "I (F16) absolutely used to Adore my English teacher (F49) until recently. So in December of 2024 i turned 16 and i was so so so excited for my birthday and i had been talking for weeks about it to my favorite teacher (English teacher). She seemed kind of careless about it but i didn't think anything about it. Worth to note, i have extremely strong emotions. So i was super excited about my birthday, smiling and giggling all morning. During English class (first period) me and my best friend sat outside and talked about our grades with the teacher. My bestie asks if the teacher has forgotten something. It takes a while before says asks if it was my birthday and i joyfully said yes. For the record in my country every single day of the year have 1-2 names like tied to it so if it's your name or middle name it's your names birthday. My English teachers middle name happened to have a name birthday the same day as my normal birthday. I asked her jokingly where my happy birthday was. And she replied with well where is my cake? it honestly pisses me off a bit. I know it doesn't have anything with religious reasons either as she has said herself that she's an atheist and does in fact celebrate birthdays. Her sassy answer made me kind of upset especially when almost all of my other teachers wished me a happy birthday. The special needs teacher specifically was super joyful towards me. To her i had just briefly said it once and she remembered (my birthday that is) . I give all my love to her for that. It made me feel like why can everyone, even teachers i don't like wish me a happy birthday but not my favorite teacher. I want to include one more thing. She might have actually mocked my attachment issues. I used to struggle with attachment issues (towards teachers) in middle school due to being bullied, having barely any friends and really poor mental health. I have told max 5 people about what i went through. My English teacher was one. She said like okay, see you tomorrow. I asked why she had responded so short and well pretty much unattended to the thing i told her and she simple said well, we don't want you to become attached again now do we. It might not have been a mockery but it really didn't feel positive as it was a fresh wound and at the time i was still struggling with getting unattached to my old teachers. I told her to piss off after that and she didn't seem to happy about it.  So AITA for thinking she is acting well like an A-hole? Edit one : i knew a lot of people would think i'm the A-hole and i understand why but telling me that nobody has to care about me, that's pretty fucking mean. Like i understand that she doesn't owe me anything but that doesn't mean NOBODY has to care about me. I know it was childish of me to be upset but sometimes that's how life works. As people also said i am still a literal child, i am well aware that the behavior won't fly and i am trying to get out of it. Also for the people saying teacher attachment is inappropriate and weird trust me i know, i have apologized to teachers in the past i was attached to since i knew that my behavior was inappropriate. I'm doing my best to get away from that issue but it's hard.",

        "selftext": "This is a throwaway for pretty obvious reasons I (17F) am a part of a blended family with two brothers, 19M and 15M. We have been a blended family since my youngest brother was 2 years old, meaning he has grown up around my family as his own. He has been a part of every single family gathering and has been deeply included due to my extended family's belief that family is more than blood. This idea is especially potent due to my father being adopted. Anyways, my younger brother, who we will henceforth call Thomas, and my second cousin, who I will call Sharon, are the same age. Due to living in the same area, unlike other family members, we see Sharon and her family often. Back when they were 13, they dated for the first time, which I promptly found out about and shamed my little brother for. To say I was livid would be an understatement. My stepmother was weirdly okay with this and even encouraged it. My father just said to let it be because he did not want to influence my brother into rebelling against them by continuing to date Sharon. They soon after broke up because, well, to put it in nice terms, no two sane people date people they are related to. So, you can imagine the craziness between them. Sharon would call my brother Thomas at all hours of the day, demanding that he be in constant contact with her. When I say constant, I mean constant. If he even went to dinner, she would call him and scream at him for leaving her. Apparently, my little brother has been hanging out with her again, and my parents have found a photo of her as my brother's lock screen, indicating that they are again dating. Of course, when I was told about this, I went a little berserk and threatened   blurted out that I should to out their relationship to their entire high schools as a form of deterrent. My father was able to stop me from doing this, and I now agree that it is most likely a bad idea to do that. My second idea was to talk to my father's cousin, who is Sharon's mother, and discuss what we can do moving forward to discourage this type of behavior. My father is trying to stop me from doing this as well, as he believes that it will again cause my brother Thomas to rebel against him and continue to date her. But if I'm being honest, I have bigger concerns at this point, as my cousin Sharon has had a lot of erratic behavior in the past, and this event is a sign of her lack of regulation surrounding her emotions as well as a lack of healthy boundaries. I have seen my brother Thomas briefly today and have already spoken to him very briskly but in no unclear terms to stop dating his cousin. He pretended like he did not hear me. I told my father about doing this, and he is now upset with me because he is very concerned about this escalating their behavior. So Reddit, am I the asshole EDIT  It has come to my attention I have used the word threaten incorrectly. I forgot to mention English is not my first language. I believe the proper word would be blurted out.  ",

My sister lives at the corner of her neighborhood and these two black trucks always accelerate around the corner. She has two young kids that are just now learning how to bike and it\u2019s been bothering her for some time. We pulled into the driveway around 11pm at night when all the sudden one of the black trucks speeds by us. My sister is insisting that we go and confront him. So I drive us over there. She introduces herself as his neighbor and says that his truck and another truck always speed around the corner and that she has 2 young kids. He says the other truck is his son\u2019s.  She politely asked him if they could slow down. His reply was \u201cdo you have radar lasers in your eyes\u201d? She said excuse me and repeats himself. At that point I got annoyed and said let\u2019s go, this guy is a dickhead. He raised his voice and called her a degenerate mother because while her kids are riding bikes she\u2019s sitting in the road near the corner\u2026 but she\u2019s only there in case one of those trucks speeds around the corner.  At that point I repeated myself much louder this time to make sure they both heard me. She starts walking back and he says step on my property to me. I tell him I\u2019m not stepping on your property and we start hurling insults at each other. We drive off still hurling insults at each other. I later found out this guy has a reputation for being a dick. They live four houses down from each other and I\u2019d hate for him to speed by out of spite and something bad happen. I told my sister (since she lives there) to go by and reintroduce herself and apologize. To basically say \u201c11pm was not the time for that and my brother was way out of line. He gets defensive of me, but we were wrong and for that I\u2019m sorry. Do you think when you come around the corner you could just slow down? I\u2019m just looking out for my kids.\u201d AITA for reciprocating his energy and is the apology a good idea for quick deescalation?",

I cuddled into him, hoping he\u2019d put the game down, but he kept playing. I jokingly said something like, \u201cI guess I\u2019m more boring than the game.\u201d He laughed and explained that he played this game most nights before bed, like how some people read or watch shows to wind down. He said it wasn\u2019t personal and not to take it the wrong way. Over time, this became a regular thing, and I started to feel uncomfortable with it. A bit of context: I\u2019m queer, and at the time, I had a strong preference for women. Zach and I had been friends for years before we started dating, so while I loved him, he was the male exception for me. Because of this, I was particularly sensitive to things that might turn me off when it came to intimacy. Eventually, I got frustrated and told him I wasn\u2019t okay with him playing phone games in bed. I said he could play, but not while we were naked together. He then argued that he needed it; it was part of his nightly routine and helped him unwind. I told him that was stupid which was not nice and he totally shut down. I felt bad that I couldn\u2019t just let this go but it was starting to effect our relationship. Was I the asshole for not being able to get past my boyfriend playing video games in bed?",

        "selftext": "So basically 2023 was a really tough time for me emotionally speaking. My grandpa's brother, who we often visited and had great conversations, died in January. That was a really big factor of my mental state, but there were other factors as well. To summarize, my grades were really bad and I was extremely sad and hopeless for the longest continuous period of time in my life, ever.  So, I decided, for some reason, that I'll talk about my problems in the class group chat. The response was immediately dismissive. The crux was that I didn't know what exactly is the problem, I just knew something is very much off. So my classmates were like Why are you talking about your problems if you don't even know what they are? We can't help you if we don't know what you need help with.    In my messages I would describe myself as having a breakdown/tantrum. And I just want to say, I am aware that just because I was in a tough mental state it doesn't mean I'm allowed to drag my classmates into it and do whatever I want. But overall, this has been on my mind a lot since it has happened, and I just want to know what others think. From both sides of the fence.  Thank you!",

        "selftext": "So, this just happened, bear with me while I collect my thoughts.  Today my mother recieved a message from her step nephew. Her brother, my uncle, married a woman who already had 2 kids. He cared for them as if they were his own and we've always been close, even though they live in another country.  The message read something along the lines of Tell your family never to speak to my mother again. You should be ashamed of yourselves. Tell your parents their son would be ashamed of them. We were so confused. For context, we are currently on vacation that my grandparents paid for. Just immediate family, my grandparents, my parents, my brother, my husband, me and my son.  My uncle passed away a few years ago and since then, my mother communicates regularly with my aunt. We face timed her for Christmas. Up until that message, we had no indication anything was wrong. Now my aunt won't answer her calls and her step nephew is refusing to elaborate. Here comes the part where I might become an asshole. My mom has asked us not to tell my grandparents. My dad, brother and husband all know. I know because I was there when my mom got the message. I told my husband and my mom told my dad and my brother.  I think my grandparents deserve to know. I think they could shed light on what happened. My nana talks to my aunt all the time, so maybe something happened? They are napping right now, so it will be a little while before I have the opportunity.  We have speculated on causes but we really have no clue.  So, WIBTA if I went against my mom's wishes and told my grandparents about the message? Update: I spoke to my mom again. All of that side of the family has blocked her on all social media. They have not blocked anyone else, at least as far as I know. My aunt has not blocked or unfriended me, nor has her daughter or granddaughter. I hadn't noticed (I'm not on Facebook much) but the one who sent the message, his wife unfriended me at some point. No idea when. We still don't have an explanation, but I thought you guys might like an update. I haven't told my grandparents, as the consensus seems to be that it's up to my mom. And I get that. For now, as long as she promises to tell them eventually, I'll hold my tongue. Update 2: My mom told my grandparents. They are as confused as we are. They haven't spoken to anyone on that side since about a week before our trip. And it turns out my grandparents were about to send a big cheque. My grandfather has said he won't send the cheque until we get this sorted. My nana is annoyed that they used her son against her for what she perceives as no reason. I think I need to add the context that we live in Canada and they live in the US. And the message came on the day Trump instituted those tariffs. We've always had a difference of politics (they love Trump for some reason) but we almost never talk politics with them. My grandfather thinks they will come around once they realize the money has dried up. Also, they were supposed to send my nana part of my uncle's ashes and they never have. She deserves to have her sons ashes. All of this came out as my nana muttered angrily.",

        "selftext": "My fianc\u00e9e (31F) and I (33M) have a daughter together (2F). My mom passed away in 2020, my dad lives on the other side of the country, and my fianc\u00e9e's parents both passed away in 2014. That leaves the only grandparent figures to my daughter that live nearby as my own grandparents (69F and 72M), who live about 15 minutes away. My grandma (step, but has been a grandma to me my whole life) has an incurable cancer, and my grandpa has dementia that is early on but progressing. Partly for these reasons, we would like our daughter to get as many memories with them as possible while they're still around and before my grandpa's memory loss becomes severe. There was one time we attempted an overnight stay with them while we were home by ourselves. It didn't go so well; she had a hard time going to sleep and was clear she has some separation anxiety. It wasn't all bad, but clearly something that needs to be worked on.  Ever since, my grandma, who between the two of them is usually the one we talk to and who makes decisions, has been quick to point out examples of her showing separation anxiety when around (which has become infrequent, the last time being on Christmas). When asking if they'd be willing to take her for a couple hours to get some time with her, whether just because or we have something to take care of, she refuses, saying she needs to get over separation anxiety before they can take her again. Our thoughts are that she won't get over it if we don't give her a chance to. And we don't exactly have a village of people able to help with that, as partly mentioned before. Meanwhile, my grandparents frequently watch the kids of my cousin (25F), the kids being 6F, 4M, 3M, and 2F. She is no longer with either of the two fathers and has been known to frequently dump her kids on our grandparents. My grandma has said multiple times after various incidents of disrespect that she will not help my cousin anymore, but ultimately winds up doing so anyway. When we bring up these issues, my grandma claims that because these kids are not well taken care of (sadly true), she needs to keep a closer eye on them; we take this as our daughter being punished for being well taken care of. She also believes they do not have separation anxiety because of the rocky relationship with their mom, so they are more willing to be at their house. She takes our pushing that we accuse her of playing favoritism with the other kids.  We realize that someone has to watch those kids so their mom can work. My situation is more fortunate in that regard as I work while my fianc\u00e9e is a stay at home mom. But we think there needs to somehow be more balance in the situation. And again, to have my daughter and grandparents to get plenty of time together before it's too late. So... AITA?",

But Amy had a habit of talking over people and cutting them, which ticked Sarah off A LOT. After 3-4 months, we finally confronted her about it, and Sarah went really low contact with Amy. Although i did want to continue being friends with Amy, i went no contact with everyone for a solid 2 months. After this, we slowly started talking as i took the initiative and contacted her, apologized and suggested to reconcile. She agreed and we agreed to meet up. On the day of the meetup, my parents needed me for some things so i had to cancel. Then we changed the dates, but my doctor's appointment was finalized on that day, i thought i could meet up with her after that, but doc was out for lunch and returned half an hour later, which is why i canceled it. I asked her today whether she'd be interested in meeting up, but she declined saying that i had disappointed her twice. Since we're in a very tense and delicate situation, I'd like some clarity.AITA? Update: After being schooled by everyone here, i spoke to Amy. We exchanged perspectives and she said that she felt guilty about the whole ordeal and it never occurred to me that she wouldn't be angry at me, but at herself. I told her that i fumbled real hard(\ud83d\udc80) and that I'll respect whatever her decision is. And unfortunately for some people who were expecting Amy to cut me off, (bless her heart) said she'll consider it and tell me what her final answer is soon.

        "selftext": "Throwaway because my partner/friends/family are avid redditors. Though this post is so obviously me, they might even know at this point.  I\u2019m not really sure what led up to the conversation about this. My partner (20M) and I (22F) started by disagreeing about peeing in the shower alone. He said that it\u2019s not normal for people to do it AT ALL. My whole family are shower pee-ers. I\u2019ve been raised to, if needed, pee, and then take a normal shower and it\u2019s acceptable since the soap washes it down. I\u2019m not a UTI girl either, so no crazy bacteria is spread to those who share the shower. I\u2019ve heard that this can be damaging to the pelvic floor and what have you, but other than that, peeing in the shower isn\u2019t damaging to the shower or worthy of jail time. My partner said it\u2019s just weird to pee in the shower overall at this point. I then share how it\u2019s something I\u2019ve grown up used to and something I consider environmental for me because, though I hate to admit, I use more toilet paper than is likely needed and it certainly saves some squares. We obviously disagree about solo peeing in the shower, but here\u2019s where it gets iffy (and slightly weird). We started arguing about how gross it is when we shower TOGETHER. Oftentimes I will do it before he gets in, but sometimes I\u2019m waking up in a morning shower, and I will strategically aim myself straight down the drain (as I can only direct myself in one position) and whizz. I move as FAR away as possible from him, give him plenty of warning, and even ASK if it\u2019s ok, to which he says it\u2019s fine. Yet, he says he HATES this; not only did he say it\u2019s not normal to pee in the shower alone, but peeing in any shower is weird, especially with him present. Now, I\u2019m not usually one to fight against things like this, because I understand it\u2019s a boundary, but holy moly y\u2019all. He then said he\u2019d rather have blood than pee getting on him. Now, that seems a bit more dangerous than my piddle puddle. Ok, ok. At this point, I said I would stop doing it while he\u2019s present, and make it a personal experience, but even that is gross to him, and now he\u2019s going back and forth about who\u2019s \u201cright\u201d here. He even said he\u2019d try it out to see how it feels. I can see why it might be gross for some people, but as long as I\u2019m not aiming at him, am I so wrong? NSFW: keep in mind the bodily fluids that are often shared between partners outside the shower. That\u2019s all I\u2019ll put up to mention as well. Someone please tell me the regularity/normalcy (or not) of peeing in the shower alone OR with a partner. I\u2019ve decided to stop for now but I didn\u2019t realize it was that big of a deal. Help. AITAH??? TLDR: my partner disagrees that it\u2019s normal to pee alone in the shower, and especially when we\u2019re showering together.  ",

        "selftext": "I (26M) was kicked out of my apartment building about a month and a half ago due to my landlord who has always used any small thing I did to threaten that they would kick me out on a moment\u2019s notice. I ticked him off a little too much for \u201cnot respecting the other people in the building\u201d and I was kicked out I had three days to clear everything out. I had also just lost my job working at the local grocery store, so I had no home and no job, just an internship at a real estate agency which I was only getting $10 an hour from; I was struggling. Luckily, one of my friends (27M) who I have known since high school offered to let me stay in their house while I found a place to live and a new job. Once, I was moved in, he said that it was nice to have someone to make him less lonely. After about two weeks of living together he started repeatedly asking if I had found any job listings and saying he found one that I would like. I had found a few places on my own too but honestly there wasn\u2019t anywhere for me that fit what I needed, good money, easy and chill, low hours, and close to my living space. And then another week went by, and he started bugging me about finding a place to live, claiming he found some great places, but honestly, I like living with him, it\u2019s nice and he has a great house. I was trying to hint to him that we could just live together, but he wasn\u2019t getting it. He started calling me a little kid because I \u201cwasn\u2019t doing anything ever and just wasting the little money [I] had.\u201d He was getting annoying, I was just trying to make more friends, so I was going to parties and bars, hanging out with people. When I finally got the courage to ask him about living together, he got all defensive and asked about if this was the plan all along, take advantage of him for a living space that I don\u2019t even pay for. I said I could, but he didn\u2019t believe me, he claimed that it was too expensive for someone living on $10 an hour and not rushing to get a job, he complained about how he was just taking care of me. I got annoyed and asked why he decided to be so mean about this and just said I couldn\u2019t live with him. I brought up that he said he enjoyed it and that he \u201clove[s]\u201d having someone to live with, I couldn\u2019t understand how he was mad. For the last week we have been ignoring each other sometimes he would tell me to \u201cfind a job for god\u2019s sake!\u201d he has become so mean, I don\u2019t know what to do. AITA?",

We visited right before my sister had end-of-semester exams for law school, and she asked that we give her space to study. That night, the insulation in my BnB was very bad and it was VERY cold (about 15 Fahrenheit). My mom slept, but I couldn't. I texted my sister and asked if I could sleep on her couch because I was shivering. She was angry I disturbed her during exams and said no. I was angry but didn't go to her house. That next morning, I asked if I could take a shower at hers to warm up because I was still freezing. She refused because she did not want to clean the bathroom after me. We argued and I told her she was unreasonable and mean. I eventually showered without her OK and left. I might have been the asshole because I showered without her permission. I also bothered her during her exams when she was very stressed. ",

        "selftext": "My boyfriend and his mom have been fighting a lot lately and because I am pretty close with his mom, she texted me to vent about my boyfriend. Since I am an honest person and loyal, I felt I had a duty to show my boyfriend what she was saying. I told him that I am okay with her texting me and venting but that I would show him what was said because I don't hide things from him, but then he texting his mom and said leave my fucking girlfriend out of this, which seems to have made things worse. Usually we have supper at her place every Sunday and Tuesday but we haven't for a whole week because of this. I reached out to my boyfriends mom today and inquired if there was a dinner this week or not and she, not that there has to be, but if there will be, and she replied with, Last I was told was to leave his Fucking girlfriend out of this.  His words, not mine.  Only going to say that things are worse and not better so probably no supper plans for a while.  I'm sorry that this affects you too. I personally do not agree with the comment he made too his mom, because if I am as much part of their family as they say I am, and him and I are looking at a future together, then I should be able to tell his mother myself when I am uncountable with something and I told him I wasn't. His comment was counter productive because it brought me into the fight when the words he said were that he wanted me to stay out of it. I feel like I need to have a conversation with my boyfriend and explain that I didn't like the comment he made to his mother and that I showed him what was said out of loyalty to him but that he needed to be loyal to me and not say anything to his mother because he should trust that I will speak up if I don't want her texting me those things. What will it be like when we have kids and his mother does something I don't agree with? I need to be able to speak for myself. So my question to you all is, AITA for showing my boyfriend the messages between his mother and I and basically making the situation worse or was he for sending his mother the text? I'm not sure what should have been done differently.",

My oldest brother (38M) Derek got a letter in the mail saying that his drivers license is suspended due to an unpaid fine. However, he never got a ticket. Derek looked at where the ticket was issued and the plate numbers and it was not his vehicle. He also wasn\u2019t in the area at the time of the ticket. He called the police station in the area and was able to identify who the car belonged to. The owner happened to be friends with my other brother, Eugene. The police officer that issued the ticket pulled up Eugene\u2019s file and confidently said that he was the one he gave the ticket to, not Derek. I know Eugene does not have a license, so I\u2019m assuming this was the motive for using a fake name. Eugene has been going down a dark path lately. He\u2019s gotten into drugs, has stolen thousands of dollars worth of stuff from myself and Derek, and was even held hostage by dealers, forcing my parents to pay almost $3000 in ransom for owed money. Derek is upset. He can\u2019t go to work at the moment to support his family because he has no license to get there and there are no buses in the area. Now that the police know who it is, they are working on charging him for fraud and arresting him in the next day or so. Derek told me, but asked me not to tell my mother because she is always bailing Eugene out and this time, he wants him to see him face his consequences. I do agree with this, however, Eugene has 4 kids, and I felt like my mother should know so she can remove them from the situation before they have to see their father being taken away in handcuffs. Derek is furious I told her. AITA? ",

        "selftext": "My (24F) best friend (24F) of seven years ghosted me. She claims I changed, cause I used to pride myself on my independence but now rely on my BF.  We\u2019ve always split the tab via PayPal, but she often forgets to pay me back. Recently at the gym, when I reminded her, she said she was tight on money, so I told her it's ok. But she added: Not that you would relate So naturally, I asked her to elaborate.Now that you've got a sugar daddy, you must have saved a lot of money HUH I reminded her that I\u2019ve only been a full-time student since July, have never dropped out, and care for a chronically ill parent, too. So what if I don't work at the moment? I also pointed out that she works part-time but only spends her money on vacations with her BF. I asked why she couldn\u2019t just be happy for me. I\u2019ve always been there for her through her struggles, including her dropping out of high school and BF problems. I asked her if she's jealous. She\u2019s a shy introvert, while I\u2019m an eccentric extrovert. We both have new relationships. She only told me about her Swiss long-distance boyfriend in December, even though they started dating in August, cause she didn\u2019t wanna jinx it. Explains why she often skipped our gym and dinner dates, as she was often abroad or working retail.  As for me, I\u2019ve been dating my BF since September. We\u2019ve known each other since 2019 through a language app and after months of helping him through paperwork, he got a work visa and moved to Germany. I showed him around and barely two weeks in, he asked me out. I understood her anxiety and stress but she didn't understand my silence on my BF. He\u2019s funny and forthcoming, a bit too clingy but also pretty and protective. I kept the relationship secret because I'm tired of getting lovebombed only for the flirt to turn out abusive & coked up. The way a man treats me is thr biggest social proof to me.  Finally, I broke the news to her, but she was pissed. I shoulda shared sooner, given how TMI and shameless I always am. I said it hurt me, too, so she she apologized, too, for hiding her own relationship and said she's burnt out from retail and her trade/apprenticeship. When she asked how I afford my trips and shopping sprees since I quit my job, I told her my BF paid. She seemed perplexed and mentioned that her BF is rather modern, they go 50/50 but she struggles a lot cause he's an older IT specialist and it takes a toll on her to live up to his living standard. Not to mention the long distance struggle. She visits him since she lives with her mom while he lives alone an has privacy. My BF, on the other hand, fights for the bill, hates my thrifting and feels uncomfortable about visiting me empty handed. He even calls me his little housewife cause I cook for him. I know I could have picked my words better but I'm not a fucking sugar baby, I'm not mooching off of him, considering I treat him like a king when he's at my place. ",

        "selftext": " My brother (24M) and I (22F) are living at our parents\u2019 house with two siblings until our finances are sorted. Some of us are learning new skills and breaking into careers while we don\u2019t have to worry about bills. I\u2019ve had issues with my older brother (Jamal, placeholder name) before, but lately, he\u2019s been combative. He talks to our two older sisters behind our backs and seems convinced by them our parents are controlling and don\u2019t want us independent. He\u2019s a pain; he doesn\u2019t say anything bad directly, but he goes out of his way to eat healthily and restrict himself in front of me, making me feel bad about my body and weight. He pretends to be supportive, though. He opens canned beans without our mom\u2019s permission, knowing he\u2019s supposed to ask to avoid a mess. His excuse is he bought it with his own money, claiming he doesn\u2019t make messes (he doesn\u2019t, to be fair). Mom gets mad at me whenever he does this, so I have to tell her, which he doesn\u2019t like since it\u2019s \u201cnot my business\u201d and \u201cthis is a problem between me and mom, not you.\u201d He does the same with eggs, setting aside food for himself to \u201csave time\u201d while working on other stuff, which is unfair. Again, he uses the excuse he bought it with his money, but if I have no money, I doubt he does either. He eats more food than us, but I get the impression he thinks he\u2019s better than us because it\u2019s \u201chealthy\u201d or he \u201cworks out,\u201d spending half his day walking around the house or outside. None of this is good for his mental health, and he never listens to us. After I took a shower, I needed to tell our mother something, so I called her and then yelled her name. Jamal came out of his room, ready to leave, and said, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to bother her over the air purifier. I\u2019m coming downstairs; I can turn it off.\u201d I wasn\u2019t asking about that, so I kept calling her and asked him to open her door. He retorted, \u201cWhat are you trying to pry her off her bed for? You don\u2019t need to bother her over every little thing.\u201d I told him I wanted to tell her something. He opened the door, then walked off. I asked if she was on her bed, and he said no. When I told him to walk inside, he said he had to \u201cbe somewhere\u201d (nowhere). I was upset since he knows I\u2019m trying to get her attention, but he does the bare minimum. I laid this out for him and called him weird for that. He cut me off, saying, \u201cDon\u2019t start this with me.\u201d I reiterated everything and insisted he was weird for not helping. He shot back, \u201cYou barely help me. You can\u2019t be bothered to throw a potato in the oven while I\u2019m outside helping our pregnant sister. How about that?\u201d I reiterated every issue of his while he walked off, telling me this was \u201cpetty and unnecessary\u201d before leaving. AITA  Edit: To clarify, I\u2019m describing how his actions make me feel. He has never outright called me fat; I just don\u2019t like watching him eat the way he does since it makes me feel bad.",

        "selftext": "Hello everyone! Just made an account, so bear with me while I try and type this out well! *Fake Names* My best friend Macy (19) and Me ( 22 ) have been best friends for 11 years. We\u2019ve been a very close pair and never had arguments. I watched her grow up while I grew up as well. She\u2019s always been like a sister to me. I\u2019ve been there whenever she needed me as she was also there for me. A few years back she had moved to Maine with her family and it absolutely devastated us. We would hang out on week days and every weekend together and now having that divide was crushing. We still kept in touch and stayed close, communication just got harder as years went on. She has recently graduated, started college and a job. I am so proud of her for all her achievements, she is one of the smartest people I know. A few months ago she got engaged to her 6 year long relationship with her boyfriend Rob ( 20 ). I was ABSOLUTELY ecstatic!!! To see her beaming for joy was a beautiful heartwarming thing. He proposed to her around all their friends when they went on a camping trip. How cute, right? She face-timed me to tell me and show me the ring. I jumped up and down and squealed for her hahaha. A few months after she was talking to me about plans for their wedding. They decided to hold off until they both graduated college to officially get married. I think that's a very wise decision on their part. After telling me this, she proceeded to say- \u201cOh btw. Destiny ( 18 ) is probably going to be my Maid Of Honor. Hope you aren\u2019t upset.\u201d I won\u2019t lie, it was like a slap to the face and it did hurt. Her and Destiny became friends when she moved to Maine. They\u2019ve been friends for around 7 years now. It hurt me only because I feel even though she\u2019s been great friends with her, it would make more sense for me to be that since we\u2019ve had a close friendship of 11 years going on 12 now. I didn\u2019t want her to feel I was trying to be an ass or poison the conversation on something exciting, so I kept quiet for now. I waited a month and I couldn\u2019t shake the hurt I was feeling. Since she moved I felt a bit like I was now the \u201cPast\u201d so to speak. I texted Macy- explaining how I truly felt and how I wasn\u2019t trying to create issues, but just voicing my feelings. She told me she was never trying to hurt me but that Destiny just meant a lot to her\u2026.but don\u2019t I as well? She told me I could still be a bridesmaid but it was just the bluntness and putting a friend she hasn\u2019t known for as long in that position that truly just hurt me and made me feel off.  Am I the asshole for being upset about this? ",

There was a moment where a few girls asked if they could sit with us. For context we were are both males. I did not really talk to their group, other than saying hi, and I was speaking to another girl about university and the states. One of the girls from the group, was flirting with my friend I believe and earlier when they first sat down, my friend asked her what she thought of Australia day, and she said Invasion Day... my parents invaded. I understood the banter, but didn't mess with that, so already knew to not engage with them and avoid them. At a certain point I was just sitting with the one girl from the group and myself, as my friend and her's went to get drinks seperately. We started talking about skincare as she saw my lip balm on the table and made a lewd comment about me having it. I told her so you like my friend and she said yeah but was saying what he was wearing wasn't nice. I asked her if she had a boyfriend and she said she was dating a guy, and I asked if her friends had boyfriends and she said yes, and I said oh it's probably best you don't sit with us, but I hope he pleases you (meant it as treats you well, BUT that is a bit weird to say) you and everything goes well. She took offence and said these aren't your seats and said a few rude things I can't remmeber, I said yes but we were here first this is our land, so you can piss off basically taking a dig at what she said before. About 20 minutes later, a member of staff came to me and pulled me aside. They explained I was reported as making an inappropriate comment to a few females and I had to leave. I was taken aback but said yeah of course, because I know better than to argue as it's a strict policy that bars need to enforce. When I was being escorted out I did explain there was a girl I told to girl to kick rocks when I found out she had a boyfriend, although I had been interacting with men/women all night and nobody had complained. I was pretty much sober as I don't like to drink much. The staff that escorted me out apologised and said they felt uncomfortable doing that to me, and I said that they were being professional and it's fine. They said they would love to have me back but as a hard  policy, any complaint is taken seriously. We exchanged names and that was it. I am 99% sure this was why I was kicked out. Whether something was taken out of context is understandable, and to be honest I should have known better to be rude. AITA for telling someone to piss off and getting kicked out, of was this blown out of proportion?",

The thing is, when everyone is gone and I'm alone in the apartment, I tend to lock the bedroom door bc it makes me feel safer.  Today my roommate was suppose to come back. Well, during the time they were coming back to the apartment, I took a nap after studying for 6 hours straight so i was lowkey drained and completely forgot about the lock door. I'm a pretty heavy sleeper and therefore i did not notice them knocking on the door. They called me once and texted me once but i slept through that. Around 2 hours later, i finally awoken and saw their text. I immediately got up to unlock it and by that time they were hella fricking pissed. I see that I do sound like ah but its not like they were locked out of the apt. idk maybe im overthinking it and i am an ahole. ",

        "selftext": "Pre-COVID, I (31F) was a bridesmaid for my cousin, Diva (34F). Everything was going smoothly until a few weeks before the wedding. Being artistically inclined, I offered to design her wedding invitations as a gift but made it clear I couldn't produce them myself due to financial constraints, as I was handling my mother's medical bills and our family dog's medication for his heart condition. To provide context, I'm an only child caring for a senior citizen (my mother, who is over 70 years old and a cancer patient) and our senior dog. As the wedding planning progressed, Diva approved my designs with some revisions, and I happily submitted them. However, when the actual invitations arrived, they weren't my designs. This was heartbreaking because if I had been informed that my design wouldn't be used, I would have been fine with it, but no one told me. I let it go and moved on. Regarding the pre-wedding parties, I couldn't attend due to my mother's and our dog's medical conditions, which Diva knew about for months and years prior. Despite this, Diva was upset. I couldn't leave my mother, as there was no one else to care for her, nor could she handle our dog, who needed medication and could be aggressive. Hiring help was also not an option due to financial constraints. The Maid of Honor (MOH) got involved, and I kept asking for consideration due to my family responsibilities. The whole family knew about my mother's condition, and some knew about our dog's condition, but I was told I wasn't fulfilling my bridesmaid duties. I had already designed the invitations and helped with bridesmaid dress choices, but I couldn't attend the pre-wedding parties. This led to a feud among the cousins and eventually reached our parents. Days before the wedding, I was still trying to be a good bridesmaid. Hair and makeup were scheduled for 3 AM, but with my responsibilities, I couldn't leave home at 2 AM. I offered to do my own hair and makeup and even negotiated to arrive before the wedding started, prioritizing the ceremony. However, they wouldn't compromise, so my mother and I decided not to attend to avoid further drama. In hindsight, it was a blessing in disguise because our dog passed away on the wedding day, and we were there for him when he passed.",

        "selftext": "/edit apparently i WBTA. I'm not going to give her any notice. I'm going to move out and let her have the place to herself until the lease expires and keep paying it. Part of the reason I wanted her gone is I wanted to leave the apartment complex to begin with. Which would have been useful into to include but I missed that. I met a woman online around 2 years ago.  We'll call her AM. I was 28 M. She was 39 F. She had her own place and I'd go over and hangout with her occasionally ordering snacks, food, etc. Aside from hanging out a few times, we were never really what you would call friends. But this past February I let someone virtually homeless I barely know move into my apartment, simply out of good faith because his job was a two block walk from my house. I didn't want him to have to take two busses to take from work every day. Figured he could save up a few pays and get his own place. I was in the hospital for two weeks and when I got out my apartment was trashed and the guy quit his job. Around this time I invited my friend AM to come stay with me as she was not in a good living situation. Three of us in a 1 br apartment. She helped me kick this guy out. I let her stay for around 2ish months before being told by a potential love interest/another friend of 2 years that I need to kick her out or she would cut ties with me and would never visit my apartment with her living there. i did it without notice, I admit I could have gone about it in a better way. One day we got done shopping at family dollar and when I got back I sat her down in the courtyard outside and told her she cannot come back inside and said I will go back in and get anything she needs to go for the night. Fast forward to October 10th or so, I reached out to AM to see how she was doing. She was at a DAS/mental services facility and said she was being discharged on Friday. I asked where she was going and she said beats me. They suggested she lie about having an alcohol problem to get housing elsewhere but they would have changed her meds in the process and she didn't want that. I apologized for the last way I made her leave as she said this resulted in her being assaulted downtown at gun point. But it's been 3 months. If you factor in letting her stay with me back in March/April. I've let her live with me five months rent free, bought her food, cigarettes and feminine/hygiene products. She has no ID, EBT or SSI/income of any form. She's been thrown in and out of hospitals/shelters since losing her housing 2 years ago.  But im on ssdi/hud. I'm technically not allowed to have guests longer than two weeks, and she has made no attempt at bettering her life or getting ahead in any way nor contributes to the house hold. Today is Jan 7th and I plan on telling her that she needs to be gone, on or by February first. I told myself I'm going to make myself a priority in the new year of 2025. This includes not drinking alcohol, not crying or giving my ex money, and not fostering someone a decade older than me (or anyone for that matter). She uses reddit sometimes and she may see this. I may link her it anyways. #WIBTA",

However, a person always brings Switch and Mario Cart which is a hit for most in the group. I so wish they wouldn't bring it! They almost always play in the main living space, and it's hard to peel off and do something else.

However, since graduating we moved to different cities for jobs and rarely see each other anymore.  I feel like I have helped her through a lot, starting with helping her through her degree, and then helping her navigate life, including interview prep for a job, proofreading some of her writing etc. Of course, that\u2019s what friends are for, so I didn\u2019t mind doing these things! As a coincidence, we got engaged at a similar time, but I set the date for my wedding earlier and invited her and her partner. She then told me that she is looking at a date just two days before my wedding, so I asked her if she was looking at any other dates since this is hugely inconvenient (we don\u2019t live particularly close and the train drivers have announced a train strike). A couple of weeks pass, and I get invited to her wedding: two days before mine. I\u2019m annoyed at the inconvenience, but ultimately I completely understand: prices/family/availability could mean that she couldn\u2019t find a different day, and ultimately it\u2019s still doable. I told her I\u2019ll make it work regardless (although my partner will not be able to make it as he will be with his family). Some time passes, and she mentions in passing that she\u2019s not sure how she will wiggle another day off (I\u2019m getting married on a weekday as it\u2019s cheaper) as she wants to do a long honeymoon. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m overthinking this or not, but why would she mention it if not \u201csoft launch\u201d the idea that she can\u2019t take the day off to travel? Am I being an asshole for thinking she can just make her honeymoon one day shorter to make it to my wedding when I\u2019m making it to hers through train strikes and the huge inconvenience of doing this just two days before my own wedding while I\u2019ll be trying to arrange family/the day in the meantime? To be clear, she hasn\u2019t told me she\u2019s not coming yet, so I\u2019m not going to do anything, but I\u2019m tempted to tell her that I\u2019m not coming to her wedding if she says she can\u2019t come to mine. I know that this is petty and will likely burn that bridge, but I feel like if she values one extra day of honeymoon more than my friendship, while I\u2019ve been pouring a lot of my time and energy into supporting her ever since we met.

We found this fancy pub which attracts a lot of tourists - I\u2019m not one as I\u2019ve been in this country for more than a year now. I\u2019m an expat, Asian (brown). We decided to enter the pub. The bouncer was standing right in front of the entrance. I saw him and made a small head nod with a smile proceeding to walk past (which I do usually with no issues at all, kinda always felt like a bar/pub code) while he was parallely saying something to me in the local language which I don\u2019t speak. Note - he didn\u2019t block the way by any means or hand gestures or there was no queue. In a second, I was aggressively pulled from behind, he snatched my backup and shouted with anger along the lines of \u201cYOU DON\u2019T WALK BY WHEN I\u2019M TALKING, YOU DISRESPECTED ME, THIS IS MY PLACE AND YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED\u201d. I was shook by this manhandling incident and apologised to him that I didn\u2019t understand the language and not meant to disrespect him by any means. He furiously said, it doesn\u2019t matter and I\u2019m denied access. I apologised and returned. Firstly, it\u2019s not a local pub, the name is evidently common across many countries and it attracts tourists - why communicate in a local language? Second, even if that was a miss from my side to not attempt to understand what he was saying or informing him I don\u2019t speak the language, was his behaviour justified or AITA? Note - I was not super drunk or unstable or alarming by any chance, also had a decent outfit for a pub and was let in with a smile by the other bouncer in a different pub. Edit - I went through the reviews of this pub in internet and the bouncers are known for their notorious racial discriminations so it\u2019s not a me issue. But nevertheless I will not play the racist card here, because I did misunderstand his communication as an invitation/greeting due to my lack of attention/language barrier. I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019d have got a different treatment if was not brown after reading the reviews.",

        "selftext": "For background, I (16m) am on the autism spectrum and have another related mental illness that causes me to very obviously mirror other peoples traits, movements, catchphrases, etc. I've been working on it in therapy, but it's still an ongoing issue and I'm not making super obvious progress. The process has been slow and I've only gotten a bit better about being independent in my personality.   Today at lunch I was sitting with my normal group of friends (Victoria, Mark, Aisley, and Nicole) and everything seemed pretty normal? We interacted fine and had good conversations. The only notable thing is that I repeated what a lot of them said in silly voices (when we were joking around) and copied this movement that Mark does a lot. He does this thing where he leans forward and wiggles his fingers in peoples faces muttering Do as I say! Do as I say! He's done this for years and I've picked it up since we've known each other. I did it to Victoria and everyone went really quiet. I assumed the joke fell flat and so I just went back to eating. The rest of lunch was normal enough and I didn't think twice about it. We walked to our next classes together and kept messing around in the halls. After that class finished and I was walking to the last class of the day, some girl I didn't know walked up to me and called me a leech and an asshole for making everyone at the table so uncomfortable when I did that movement at lunch. I sat there and just blinked at her, which I assume she took as rude because she stormed off.    When I got home I got my phone (I left it in my room) and checked it. Turns out I had a bunch of messages from Nicole that she wanted to warn me that I might get kicked out of the table. Apparently this is an ongoing issue and they haven't liked me for a while. I asked Mark about it but I think he blocked me? When I asked Victoria about it she said that it was because I kept copying them and it was weird to be around me. I tried to explain that I didn't really mean to creep them out, but that I was sorry and would try to be better. She didn't want to hear it and I guess I'm just... kicked out now? I just want to know if I'm actually an asshole or if I'm valid in feeling a bit upset about all of this. So, AITA for stealing my friends' personalities? ",

        "selftext": "Context - We've been together for about 5 years, engaged for 1. We've lived together for about 2 years. We are mid 20's. Recently the amount of arguments have increased, dare I say I never have issues with anything and am generally relaxed, however sometimes my SO thinks I'm Too chill and don't stress enough (Which I figure would be a good thing? I just don't see a point in stressing because either things can be fixed, or they're out of my control).  Anyway, today we were in the kitchen and I was washing a couple glasses and we were about to make dinner. She needed a small bit of hot water and I turned the faucet into the sink tub closest to her that I wasn't using. I had the temperature in the middle and about middle pressure too as I was only cleaning a few glasses.  I turned the temperature on hot for her, and considering she only needed a little bit I kept the pressure on medium. She turned the pressure on max, left it for a few seconds, put it back to medium, then got her little bit of water. I asked why she did that and she said it Makes the water boil quicker. I said pressure doesn't, it's whether the temperature is on hot or cold and it would have been hot on the pressure it was on when I gave it to her. She said I was wrong but I insisted.  Lo and behold, argument (On her end). I'm a c word sometimes who never believes her (It's a faucet, there's no conspiracy?), she doesn't want dinner anymore, and she's leaving to either go to the gym, or in her words Park somewhere to get away from you.  I'm confused as to the escalation and if I should have just left it. I didn't say anything in a 'Condescending' tone at all. I said it so monotone and normal like it was just basic conversing. Am I the asshole that I should have just said, Okay you're right and left it? Or is standing my ground about the basic use of a faucet valid?  ",

        "selftext": "My (33M) close friend (37m) is a season ticket holder at Dodger stadium and got tickets to World Series game 1, inviting me to the game for his face value. I happily accepted and asked if I could pay him back in installments, which he agreed to, and we had a great time. When the dodgers won the championship, he then invited me to the Championship celebration for his face value and this, being much cheaper, I paid him for immediately. Once again, we had a great time, however, after the celebration we both noticed that the plastic beer cups they gave out after the game were pretty great memorabilia and I saw one near me that I grabbed with the intention of washing it and using it at home. He looked around and didn\u2019t see another and asked me if he could have the one I grabbed. I laughed and said \u201cno, this is mine.\u201d He appeared frustrated, but I then went to search for a second cup for him. In the process of searching, we got separated and we left without the chance to say goodbye.  We live in different parts of the state and don\u2019t talk too often, but a month and a half later he calls me and says he wants to express some resentment he has with me for my behavior. He expresses that he believes I should have happily given him the cup given that he got me the face value tickets to both events when he could have easily made money by selling the tickets on the second market and instead he was kind enough to sell them to me. He was also very turned off by my reaction having laughed at the idea of giving him the cup saying that he felt I was disrespectful. I apologized and said that I intended no disrespect, but also said that I definitely didn\u2019t owe him the cup as I paid the same amount he did and it was his choice to sell me the tickets and not take the profit. He disagreed and we moved on after I offered him the cup because in all honesty, it\u2019s a $5 cup and not that important to me. He declined it saying it\u2019s the principle of the matter. Now I am sitting here feeling frustrated because this all feels like such a silly thing to hold a resentment over. The fact that he had this resentment towards me for a month and a half and felt the need to talk about it so long after the fact just feels petty and it\u2019s hard for me to take seriously.  So AITA for finding this whole situation ridiculous and being frustrated this he feels so easily disrespected over such minor grievances? Also, did I owe him the cup? Edit: I do want to say that I was incredibly grateful to my friend for everything. I paid for parking which was $50. I thanked him profusely. I posted pictures on instagram of us together where I expressed my gratitude, etc. There is an assumption being made that I wasn\u2019t grateful and I was, I just didn\u2019t respond with that for the cup instance. Idk if that makes a difference, but there you go!",

        "selftext": "I had a friend for years. We were great friends, if not best friends to each other. She's the type who HAS to be in a relationship otherwise she thinks she's worthless.  For perspective; she was single for a whole TWO MONTHS once and was claiming no one loves her and she was worthless, life wasn't worth living alone, etc. Going extreme with it. Of course I told her all that wasn't true. Though at the same time I had no sympathy for her because I had been single for years. It was an unintentional, I hope, slap in the face to me. Well, she also had the habit of saying Every Single New Boyfriend makes me so happy! I really found the one! No one's ever made me feel like this before!  After boyfriend number 12 or so, I noticed the pattern.  She got with a guy, stayed with him for a year or more but then, out of nowhere, dumps him and gets with a new guy. Immediately moved in with new guy.  Not her typical move. When asked about it she claimed the last relationship was done long ago, and I morned it months ago. He had his chance to make things right. I finally spoke my mind on this. That she had essentially clung to the old boyfriend because she can't tolerate being single. Instead of ending the relationship and being on her own, she selfishly clung onto him until she found someone else to latch onto. She was offended by this. Claimed I should be happy for her because she's the happiest she's ever been. This new guy has his stuff together, has a car, has his own house. Treats her right for once. I tried to get her to recognize that she has said the same thing about Every new relationship. She somehow twisted this, claiming I said she was happy with her drug addicted ex (that had been, 5 boyfriends previously, I believe) No. When she first met that guy, she said the exact same things. But she's comparing the worst of that relationship with the start of this one. Ignoring the start of the previous one. I essentially told her what she did was wrong and that I don't approve of this decision of hers. I thought it was a bad move all around and worried she would end up in an even worse situation eventually. She twisted this into me wanting her to be miserable and alone. Refusing to accept when I said otherwise. Then we cut contact and I've not heard from her since.  What does the internet decree? Was I the asshole?",

        "selftext": " I made plans with my wife and two friends to have them over for dinner and games on Saturday. Basically it was a double date. I bought new controllers and the newest version of Mario Party so we could all play together. In the morning I cooked and prepped a meal to serve the four of us and left it in the crock pot to cook for 7 hours. Then my wife and I left to visit my nephew who had just made it out of the ICU. I had given my friends a time frame between 5-9pm to come over. We ended up staying at the hospital until 5. The friends (which are a couple) called to let us know they were there at 5. They didn't let us know they were on the way over so we couldnt intercept them and let them know we weren't home yet. My wife told them we would be back in a half hour. They have the code to our home so they could have gone in and sat to wait, but I think they just sat in the driveway for almost an hour. The traffic coming back was horrible. They texted us at 5:45 and said we left. Going on a date instead. And then did not respond to us after that. They're obviously pissed that we were late and maybe feel like their time was disrespected. I told them I was sorry I didn't communicate that we were out and that I wished they could have tried the food at least. My wife offered for them to come back after their date to eat with us but they declined.  I feel like we were both in the wrong here by not communicating our locations. I understand we were late to our own party, but that's why I gave the wide range of 5-9pm. I'm just waiting now to let them cool off and see if they eventually respond to my apology. I felt really dissapointed/sad that I had all this food and my fun night with friends was cancelled, and I'm sure they felt bored and annoyed as they waited.  ********Update********I called both of them individually and told them I was sorry for disrespecting their time. They were both understanding and forgiving. I lost track of time when I was at the hospital because my nephew was starting to walk and talk again after a near death illness. I should have texted them while I was there but didn't realize until it was too late. Neither did my wife. I felt defensive and disappointed that they did their own thing and hoped they would have texted before coming over. I told them a time and they came during that time so they are at no fault here.

        "selftext": "Hey people, i just wanted to know if i as being an AH in this situacion that happened in two weeks back in december. Long story short two friends (M28, F28) and me(M27) took a taxi to a friends house to spend Xmas. We live currently in a EU country and the main language is english, we speak spanish as well as us three are latinos. During the ride i sit on the passenger side and mostly check the map and enjoy the view, while answering a thing or two in the convo my friends are having in the back (all in spanish) After we arrived i pay the driver, wish him a merry xmas, 5* review and a tip, but my friends tell me why i did that, that he was a grumpy dude with a sour face towards us the whole ride and didnt even say bye or nothing, that every time we spoke in spanish he would look mean or something (i didnt really noticed or checked him at the time). Me not thinking too much into it i said maybe it was because we were using another language instead of english, and he thought we were talking about him. They said why would we talk in english if he isnt included in the conversation, is not his business and i shouldn't have give him the review or tip. I just said that when in company of other people of different countries is nice manners to speak a common language and they got sour at me for that for a couple of hours, but after they got over it. Still it kept me thinking if they thought i was looking down on them or they were actually right in the fact that it was our conversation. I understand it was not a workplace situation, more of a personal one but for me you should try to accomodate to whatever new place you're living in currently, including having casual conversations in that language. So AITA for suggesting they should speak english?",

        "selftext": "I\u2019ve had a best friend since childhood. We share many hobbies and generally get along with a \u201cyou do you, I do me\u201d attitude. We\u2019ve had great times over the years, but at least once a year, there\u2019s a situation where he gets triggered, leading to a one-sided \u201cfight.\u201d My wife always reassures me, saying, \u201cHe is so silly, don\u2019t worry, he will come back as he always does.\u201d But I wonder if I\u2019m missing something. These situations usually begin with him venting about something stressful or self-destructive in his life. For instance, he often complains about his career and how it\u2019s ruining his mental health. I once suggested he explore other options, which triggered him. He\u2019s a \u201cgrind to get ahead\u201d kind of guy, but I value my peace, so we often clash on perspectives. The latest issue revolves around his addiction to a video game. We used to play it together when we were younger, but I quit because I didn\u2019t enjoy the anger it caused. He\u2019s recently returned to the game and keeps sending me memes and videos about it, despite knowing I haven\u2019t touched it in 8\u20139 years. He constantly complains about the game, yet tries to rationalize it as a \u201chobby\u201d he enjoys. This pattern of seeking validation is familiar. He always wants me to say, \u201cI\u2019m happy for you, bro,\u201d but it never ends there. When he bought a house, I congratulated him, but he wouldn\u2019t stop talking about how expensive it is and how he\u2019s grinding to pay it off. I once asked, \u201cIs it all worth it?\u201d and that triggered him too. Our conversations follow a predictable cycle: 1. He complains (\u201cWoe me and my hard life,\u201d either directly or via memes).2. I respond with sarcasm, suggesting he reanalyze the value of his choices.3. He deflects, saying things like, \u201cI\u2019m not like other people\u201d or \u201cIt isn\u2019t affecting me.\u201d4. I double down, voicing concern more directly, using analogies like, \u201cJust because an alcoholic has gone to therapy doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t still crave alcohol.\u201d5. He gaslights me, saying, \u201cChill out,\u201d or calling me \u201cdoom and gloom.\u201d6. When I point out his deflection and gaslighting, he blows up, accusing me of thinking I\u2019m \u201cbetter than everyone\u201d or knowing \u201ceverything.\u201d In the latest blow-up, he went further, calling me \u201ctoxic\u201d and saying things like, \u201cYou\u2019re the reason you have no friends,\u201d \u201cYou have a stick up your ass,\u201d and \u201cYou\u2019re mentally fucked up, not even autistic or have an excuse, just mentally sick and fucked up.\u201d I told him, \u201cI\u2019m going to let you get this out of your system,\u201d and walked away. My wife, who has witnessed similar situations before, was supportive and said, \u201cWTF.\u201d Now, I feel apathetic and plan to set boundaries: \u201cEither you get therapy, write me a plan for how you\u2019ll change your attitude, or please don\u2019t talk to me again.\u201d I wonder, though\u2014am I the problem? Have I been the A-hole my whole life and just never noticed? Am I losing my mind, or is this just a toxic dynamic I\u2019ve been stuck in?",
