My mom started to complain to me about it and I told my mom \u201cshe technically wasn\u2019t invited and my wife had no expectations to entertain her in my wife\u2019s cabin while my wife is on vacation\u201d  My mom started saying well she wouldn\u2019t have came if she knew that. I told my mom next time take the hint. If you aren\u2019t invited don\u2019t come. My parents left after dinner. My mom complained that my wife should have tried to be a gracious hostess and I said maybe my mom should try not being an unwanted guest. ",

        "selftext": "When my wife and I were talking about getting married, my Dad said that he would give us a down payment for a home. We were thrilled and kept that in mind. We would be able to afford a good starter home with his help, and we scrimped and saved to add to it. Except apparently HE meant \u201ca sum of money good for a down payment for a house near us\u201d where the cost of living is low. He did not ever mean a down payment for a home in Colorado, where my wife and I have lived since we were in college. He said he thought I would be \u201csmart enough\u201d to realize that we\u2019d need to move somewhere with a lower COL than Colorado. He keeps saying move to a cheaper city. Our lives are here. Our friends, our jobs, our hobbies. You can\u2019t exactly leave your house and be up on top of a 14,000ft peak in 6 hours where my family is. I told him that we had never talked about moving back there, and we never would. That we would rather be stuck renting for a while longer than be stuck somewhere we didn\u2019t want to be, and the \u201cmove to a cheaper city\u201d wouldn\u2019t work for us. He said \u201cso be it\u201d and gave us the amount and that was that. I expressed gratitude and thanked him for the money. It is still towards the goal. Well because of this shift in our finances, we have had to make a lot of changes to save up the rest of the money. We have had to cut out vacations, birthday gifts, holidays, etc. We won\u2019t be traveling home for a few years. At our current rate, we should have an ok down payment by the end of next year (2025). My Dad confronted us about this because we won\u2019t come for a summer break trip and told me that I was being a selfish, entitled brat because I hadn\u2019t gotten my way. That I was essentially punishing the rest of the family because we \u201cassumed\u201d what his gift would be. I told him that I was grateful for the amount he gave us, but that it means we do need to buckle down and save every penny if we want to be able to afford a house anytime soon. Even townhouses around us are easily over 400k, and that\u2019s for the sketchy ones. But is my Dad right? AITA? **Edit to add FAQ:** There was no amount formally discussed. He said a down payment and that was that. For my siblings, he paid for college. He paid cash in full for my sister's house, it was $317,000. He did not pay for my college. They are invited to come here anytime, but believe it should be me to go there because I am the one who moved. No, we do not go out to eat, avocado toast, Starbucks, cable, etc etc. ",

She chose a seafood restaurant that we'd never been to. In looking over the menu I saw that the vast majority of the dishes contained shellfish. There were a few fish entrees, as well as some surf and turf. But there were only a couple of non-seafood dishes. Our son (15m) is deathly allergic to shellfish. He also can't stand fish. There were only a couple of dishes there that he could actually eat. I didn't want to take him there because I knew that he wouldn't really enjoy his meal and I was worried about cross contamination. I told my daughter that this restaurant wouldn't work and that she would have to pick out a different one. My son said that he would be fine just staying home; that we could use the money that we would have spent on his meal to just order him a pizza instead. My husband also insisted that since it was our daughter's birthday that she should be able to choose the restaurant, and that our son would be fine home alone with pizza and videogames. But here's the thing; we can only afford to go out as a family every so often. When we splurge on a restaurant meal, I want BOTH of our children there. I insisted and my daughter chose a different place and we had a nice meal AS A FAMILY. But she is still a little salty that she didn't get to have her first choice of restaurants. Most people I've asked say I'm wrong. But, again, we can only afford to go out every so often. Is it so wrong that I wanted to do it as a family? My daughter still had a nice birthday meal. ",

        "selftext": "My girlfriend is on the bigger side, which is something I do not mind. I am on the more fit side, I\u2019m pretty lean, have well defined muscles and probably around 15% body fat. I used to be about 40 pounds heavier and lost the weight pretty simply. My girlfriend always complains about her weight and her body. I tell her I find her sexy for so many reasons outside her body and it didn\u2019t matter to me whether she got bigger or smaller. Eventually she decided she wanted to lose weight, I offered to help and when I pointed out things she could be doing better she gets mad at me. She isn\u2019t losing weight currently and in fact says she is gaining a few extra pounds. I ask her what exactly she eats in a day, she says she eats healthy so she should lose weight. I question that and we have an argument. I tell her that if she wants to show me, let me just spend a day with her and see what she eats in a day. She said only if I don\u2019t make comments on what she\u2019s eating as she\u2019s eating it. I agreed. Now by the end of the day she had consumed, a plate of avocado toast that was about 400 calories, a coffee that was 110 calories, an 800 calorie salad from chick fil a and a fry (as a \u201creward\u201d for the salad) and veggie burrito that was about 500 calories. Along with snakinga but throughout the day. Her total consumption was about 2200 calories. At the end of the day I explained this to her. My exact words were that the amount of calories she is consuming is the amount I need to maintain my weight as a man 5 inches and 20 pounds bigger, who is constantly active. So chances are she\u2019ll slowly gain weight eating like that and that eating healthy isn\u2019t going to guarantee she\u2019ll lose weight. She got super fucking pissed at me and told me I wasn\u2019t helping her and was just shaming her. I told her I want to help her but she did not listen.  AITA ",

But he wasn\u2019t there. I waited a few minutes, but I couldn\u2019t call him, and he had the car key. I tried walking to the car, but he wasn\u2019t there.

I told him I\u2019d been looking for him, but I wasn\u2019t blaming about it, but he got super defensive and told me it was my fault for not seeing him and I had no reason to be upset.

They used to be the same weight until they were around 7, when Megan started getting chubby, but still healthy weight. When she was 11, Megan was considered medically overweight. I went to a doctor for advice, and he said that I shouldn\u2019t worry too much since a lot of kids gain weight right before puberty, and then \u2018balance out\u2019 after their growth spurt. The twins had their growth spurt last year, and Megan\u2019s weight has only increased since then, to the point where she\u2019s actually obese. So I decided to implement a healthy diet for the entire family. I slowly started to cut back on sugar, junk food, and unhealthy snacks. I cook them high volume, low calorie meals full of vegetables and protein so that they still feel full after eating. Neither of the twins are very athletic, so I\u2019ve also tried encouraging them to engage in physical activities, like swimming, bike riding, trampolining, etc. I tried putting emphasis on staying healthy instead of losing weight. However, Alana guessed that the real reason for this new diet is because I want Megan to lose weight. She started complaining that it\u2019s not fair that she also has to diet because her sister\u2019s fat. I told her that I didn\u2019t want Megan to feel singled out and feel as though she\u2019s the only one being punished for her weight. AITA?

        "selftext": "So I am the events chair of my fraternity for the semester and I planned out a Halloween party that happened yesterday. At the party we typically have a huge costume contest. You pay 5 dollars to enter and if you win, you win the pot. We usually pull about 30 to 50 entries. So the prize is pretty nice. This year we had 40 people enter and about 160 people attending.\u00a0 In years past, the winner has been this one specific chick That my brothers wanna fuck. Her costume is usually the typical sorority girl costume (an animal of some kind, boots, fishnet leggings, a short skirt, basically a bra or corset, and then animal ears and light face paint).\u00a0 Now I\u2019m not a Halloween nazi. This year my costume was literally just a angel wings, and white shorts, and a halo. I know fully that I\u2019m dressing up so hot guys that think I\u2019m hot will take notice and that it\u2019s not a \u201cgood costume\u201d. Her costume isn\u2019t good. Sure, she looks good in it. But the point of the party is who has the best breasts So we have the contest, and she\u2019s wearing her MO. She was a bee, but her ass was hanging out and her boobs were about to fall out of her shirt. So we held the contest, people voted anonymously, and guess what. She won. But by one vote. I hadn\u2019t voted yet, so I simply casted my vote then my vice chairman, who agreed with me casted his vote. That just happened to be enough to put her at second place.\u00a0 When I told my by brothers they bitched and moaned about it, but I told them she simply didn\u2019t win and she should do better next year. They eventually talked me into creating a runner up prize of 50 dollars to the girl. When we announced the winner, she was visibly upset. This was the first time she hasn\u2019t won in the last 4 years. Now apparently, last night one of my brothers was simping hard and told her that I intentionally voted against her because I didn\u2019t like her (not true, I\u2019m genuinely apathetic about her). She found me later that night and cursed me out and said I had a problem with her. I told her simply that we weren\u2019t having a sluttiest costume contest, but a best costume contest and that she\u2019s lucky we bent the rules to give her 50 bucks. We argued and ended up getting separated. Now a lot of my brothers are pissed at me for pissing her off. ",

About two hours in, the lights come on and an announcement crackles through the intercom: turbulence ahead, fasten seatbelts. Pretty standard stuff. Then, all hell breaks loose. This woman, maybe late 40s, impeccably dressed, starts freaking out. Screaming about air pockets, demanding to speak to the pilot, the whole nine yards. Flight attendant (super patient lady, bless her) tries to calm her down, explains it's standard procedure, turbulence is normal. Nope, not having it. This lady, who we'll name Jane, throws a fit.  Not the screeching, nails-on-a-chalkboard kind, but a cold, steely fury.  She accuses the flight attendant of lying, of putting everyone in danger, and demands to be deplaned immediately.  Flight attendant says that's not possible mid-flight, and Jane launches into this whole spiel about how she's a doctor (pulls out an ID to prove it), and if something happens, it's on the airline. Now, the rest of the plane is awake.  People are grumbling, some looking scared, a baby starts crying.  Flight attendant is trying to reason with Jane, but it's like talking to a brick wall.  Finally, I just lose it.I yell out (probably a little too loudly), Look lady, we all get turbulence.  It's not a five-star resort, but it's safe.  Sit down and shut up before you get yourself arrested!Everyone stares at me.  Jane spins around, eyes blazing, and starts in on me about disrespecting a medical professional.  I fire back that a real doctor wouldn't be causing a scene and freaking everyone out.  The flight attendant dives in, trying to mediate, but the damage is done.We hit some turbulence, not terrible, but enough to jostle the plane. Jane freaks again, and some people start getting panicky.   I feel awful, maybe I made things worse?  The flight attendant gives me a look that could curdle milk, but then steers Jame away to talk to her privately.By the time we land, things are calmer, but the tension is thick.  Jane gives me a withering look as she disembarks, and a few people mutter thanks under their breath. So, AITA?  Did I just escalate a bad situation, or was I right to shut down a meltdown that was putting other passengers on edge?  I'm honestly not sure.",

I mention it to my girlfriend in passing today and she was visibly upset when I told her that I said that to Lily. She said it makes her look bad. She also said that I should have told her about the invite, I asked her if she would have even gone, she said no. I said what's the point then? AITA for telling Lily that I didn't want to 'babysit' my girlfriend at a wedding where she didn't know anyone?  Edit: Thank you everyone for all the comments telling me how big of an AH I am, I needed it. I took my girlfriend out for brunch, had a good talk, and I apologized. I told her going forward I will extend all invitations to her and be careful of saying things that paint her in a bad light. She is an amazing woman and what I said was not cool at all. She accepted my apology and we are good now. To clarify a few things, we've been dating for years, no we aren't breaking up over this, yes we both love each other.  She has accompanied me to numerous weddings, I don't force her to always stay at home.  I was not trying to meet an 'old high school girlfriend'. The groom invited only male friends from high school so it was me hanging around my old crew (no girls). The groom isn't going to invite high school girl friends to his wedding.  I truly didn't mean to hurt my girlfriend but I did and I accept that what I said was wrong. Thank you! ",

        "selftext": "I (47M) have a son (14M) from a previous marriage to my late wife. She passed two years ago and for my son the wound is still very fresh. My son and her were very close as they look exactly alike and had a lot of the same interest in reading, history, and art. Their favorite place in the world is the British Museum in London. Their passion project has been redrawing peices from the museum for the last two years before . For the last  four years for my wife\u2019s birthday in June and my son\u2019s birthday in December we go to England for a week so they can spend time in the museum.  However Since she died, my son and I have continued going for his birthday. The problem is with my new wife (39F). Shes only been with us on this annual trip once last year and she complained the whole time. Now however, we recently found out we are expecting a child together in May. She raised it to my attention that the money I\u2019ve used for the trip could be better used to be saved for the baby and we could instead do something else for my son\u2019s birthday. I thought about it and I agreed. I was worried how he\u2019d take it as this is the only thing he wants for his birthday. He dosent ask for gifts or cake, or a party. All he cares about is this goddam museum  We broke the news to my son yesterday and he flipped out. He was so upset and when my wife tried to tell him why we were saving the money and where the money was going to, he said he didn\u2019t give a damn and we got into an argument about it. He said he was upset because if he didn\u2019t go this year he\u2019d miss the new exhibit he\u2019d been wanting to see, and he accused my wife of doing this on purpose because \u201cshe already dosent like me\u201d he said. I admit I yelled at him and he started crying and for the last 24 hours, he hasn\u2019t spoken to me. Am I the asshole?",

However, when we got there, one of my friends was pulled aside and told to weigh herself. She\u2019s technically obese, and they told her that she couldn\u2019t participate since she weighed too much for the harness. She was extremely upset by this and started crying. She then asked the rest of us if we could do something else instead. However, everyone else really wanted to try rock climbing, and we didn\u2019t want to miss about because of one person. I said we could hang out with her after we finished, but she just went straight home. The next day, she texted us saying that we were fake friends for abandoning her and making her feel excluded for her weight. She said I was selfish for even suggesting rock climbing without considering her weight, because I\u2019d assumed that she weighed enough for the equipment. I told her that it wasn\u2019t our fault that she wasn\u2019t allowed in, but she said the rest of us should\u2019ve stood by her. AITA?",

I knew her family was well-off based on the stories she told me about her upbringing, but I didn\u2019t get a chance to meet her parents until this week when we all went to their beach house to spend a few days and celebrate her father\u2019s 60th birthday. The house wasn\u2019t just HUGE but it also employed a staff of about 8 people. I was never used to being served like that, and I witnessed some behaviors from my girlfriend and some of her family towards the workers that made me feel uncomfortable. Some examples: A) after our first night, I heard her mother tell one of the housekeepers to clean the bedroom my girlfriend and I were staying in; I told her mother everything was in order and that I already made our bed before leaving; her mother then told me (in the presence of the housekeeper) that I shouldn\u2019t bother because that\u2019s her (the housekeeper\u2019s) job. B) the other morning my girlfriend and I woke up after everyone else had their breakfast; I went into the kitchen to grab some coffee and saw the cooks were already starting to prep for lunch, so I told them I didn\u2019t want to bother them and made the coffee myself; my girlfriend came into the kitchen moments later and saw me making coffee; later that day she complained to her mother (without even asking me how things came about) that the cooks left me to make my own coffee. I had to explain everything. C) on her father\u2019s birthday, they had a fancy dinner with some other guests that came just that day, and some of the staff was made to stand in the room with their backs to the wall as we sat at the table and ate (it was like some Downton Abbey shit). I kept my mouth shut for the entire trip, but as soon as we came back I couldn\u2019t hold it any longer and told my girlfriend it made me really uncomfortable to see how she behaved towards the staff and also gave some examples of instances when I felt her parents were rude to them. My girlfriend didn\u2019t take this well. She said that I\u2019m the AH here for judging their lifestyle. In her mind we had a perfect week together and I was withholding my judgment until I could unleash it all on her. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m an AH for speaking my mind.",

        "selftext": "Last weekend, I attended my brother\u2019s college graduation. After the ceremony, I found the rear of my trunk had been hit. The other driver was still there. She was an 18 year old who was crying hysterically while her mom tried to calm her down. The girl apologized profusely and said she had overestimated how much room she had to back out and hit my car. I wasn\u2019t upset because mistakes happen. I asked if she had insurance and she was too worked up to answer. So, I turned to her mom and she said yes, they\u2019d go get it as well as call the police so there could be an official report for the insurance company. Cool. The girl was still really worked up. I told her, it\u2019s fine. Don\u2019t worry about it. I\u2019m not upset and accidents happen. She\u2019s still a mess when the cops show up. I found this a little overdramatic and admittedly rolled my eyes. I obviously don\u2019t know this girl but it was beginning to feel like she was trying to manipulate her way out of trouble-even though the cop and I both said these things happen and that the insurance would likely take care of it. Eventually, the police left. I told the girl to calm down, it\u2019s over and stop being dramatic. Then, I got in my car and was ready to leave. My sister was with me the whole time. She told me I was unnecessarily mean to the girl. I said she was being overdramatic for no reason, especially as no one yelled at her the entire time. My sister pointed out this girl is likely a new driver, probably worried she ruined whoever she was there to celebrate, etc. Plus, she\u2019s probably worried about her rates going up. Or maybe she has anxiety or whatever. Even if she was trying to manipulate with tears, I didn\u2019t \u201chave to be a dick\u201d. I shrugged it off and let it go. So far, her insurance has been cooperative and it seems this will all be resolved rather quickly. The subject came up at the party we had for my brother. Most of my family thought I was being a dick. Though some agreed she needed to calm down. AITA? ",

She instantly tells me that she doesn't know why he never changed it but I can decline or sign the cheque over to her once I receive it.. Instantly I am in shock, he's gone? And he left me on there? Why? I went back and forth wondering if this was on purpose or accidental.. it had been years, approximately 6 since we mutually civily split up. I was informed he had a new gf that lived with him and she has 2 kids from a previous relationship that threw a wrench into things more.. is there a reason she never got put on it? Was this all just a big mistake? Today it has been 1 week and this has been very hard especially since his mom has been terrorizing me all week trying to get me to agree to give her this money. She has said the most hurtful things, and has sent me the most disrespectful photos and video of her son in his last moments..As of right now I haven't even gotten in touch with the insurance company, I have no idea how much this is or if I need a lawyers help at this point.  Well today is the day I woke up knowing 100% I am keeping this money and I am not going to feel bad at all for helping my family with a gift my ex left for me. Unfortunately part of me still wonders if it's the right thing to do by my ex.. and if these were his wishes in the end. A little info too add, my home burnt too the ground 3 years ago July 20th and October 1st 2 years ago my mom passed from cancer as well... it has been a long hard few years and this money would literally buy myself a new bra for the first time in 3 years.. my little clan could really use this money and I think my ex knew that..

        "selftext": "My wife has mentioned in the past that she wanted to try the Krabby Patty burger and a pineapple Frosty from Wendy's. On my way home from work, I decided to surprise her. I picked up a Krabby Patty burger, a chicken sandwich for myself, and two pineapple Frostys. I knew she was about an hour away, so I told her I had a surprise waiting for her when she got home. To keep the food fresh, I put her burger in the fridge and the Frosty in the freezer. I even ordered the burger without lettuce, thinking I could avoid it getting soggy, and we have lettuce at home that we could add fresh. When she got home, she was excited about the Frosty and asked, Is there a Krabby Patty burger too? I told her to check the fridge, and that\u2019s when things went downhill. She got upset because the burger was cold and I didn\u2019t get fries. She said that real justice would have been me waiting for her to come home so we could both get fresh food together, or at least putting my food in the fridge too, so we\u2019d both be eating cold food. She accused me of always expecting grand thanks for doing gestures that aren\u2019t as big as I think they are and said I didn\u2019t listen to her, since she wanted the full meal, not just the burger and Frosty. She also said she\u2019s not going to pretend to be grateful for something that wasn\u2019t what she asked for. I was just trying to do something nice, and now I feel like my gesture was totally unappreciated. AITA? Update: so we talked about it and I explained that I didn't have a problem if she would have said, I appreciate the gesture but I would have liked to get it together or if we would have waited until she was home.  I told her I understood why she was upset and we both agreed that there was a better way to talk about it.  She took a bite just now and said this is just a Dave's single with fancy sauce, so she doesn't even want it anymore hot or cold. Update 2: alright y'all, thanks for the discussion.

        "selftext": "I (48m) have a daughter Lisa (15f) from my first marriage. I\u2019m not on particularly good terms with her mother, and Lisa unfortunately became an outlet for her resentment towards me, which ended up souring our relationship massively. Lisa is a good person, but unfortunately she takes after her mom in terms of demeanor and often acts rude and entitled. A few years ago I married again. Lisa decided to not attend my wedding and she said a bunch of hurtful things to my then fianc\u00e9e Rosemary (38f). Since then, our relationship got even worse. When Rosemary and I welcomed our son a year and a half ago, Lisa sent me a text saying that since I have my perfect baby now, I could stop pestering her and trying to play family with her. It hurt me deeply, and I ended up distancing myself from her, though I kept sending her $100 a month as her allowance. Recently we had an unplanned addition to our family. Long story short, Rosemary\u2019s sister, who wasn\u2019t a good parent to start with, terminated her custody rights over her son Blake (17m). Rosemary and I decided to take Blake in. Unfortunately a few years ago Blake got in a horrible car wreck that left him permanently disabled. Luckily he can somewhat walk and doesn\u2019t need 24/7 assistance around the house, but that\u2019s about it. Blake is an amazing person and he quickly became a part of our family. I decided to give the $100 allowance to Blake instead. He was beyond happy and grateful. I also made a hard decision and gave him my car. It\u2019s a \u201822 Cadillac Escalade, and I was planning on getting rid of it this year anyway since Lisa is turning 16 in a month and I wanted to gift it to Lisa. Now it\u2019s Blake\u2019s car and he absolutely loves it. He really needed a car because his mobility issues don\u2019t let him get around easily anymore, and it changed his life massively. Of course Lisa didn\u2019t like it. When she realized that she wasn\u2019t getting any allowance, she called me and asked what\u2019s wrong. It was the first call I received from her in a year, if not more. I explained that now when my family had expanded, I\u2019m not having enough money. I\u2019ll be still sending her mom the child support payments as per court agreement, but she shouldn\u2019t expect anything extra. She asked me about the car since she knew about my plans on giving her a car. I told her that now the situation changed and I no longer could give her a car. I\u2019ll admit, what I said next was probably assholish of me, since I told her that I now have two children to play family with and asked her to stop pestering me.  This caused her to blow up completely to the point she got her mom to call me and scream at me, and so did her new husband. They threatened to sue me, Lisa said she\u2019ll go no contact and so on. I just brushed off the threats, especially since Rosemary is a lawyer and I made my peace with poor contact with Lisa years ago. They also managed to write a few mean things to Rosemary and Blake, and this is what got me wondering whether I was an asshole here.",

        "selftext": "I've been raising my 8yo nephew Jack after both his parents died in 2019. I went from being a 34 year old bachelor to being a single dad overnight. I don't regret it or anything but it has and does require a lot of sacrifice. My brother made good money and invested into a house before died. It's being rented at a loss because the rent is less than the mortgage and other costs but it will be worth a fortune when it is paid off. So I'm basically paying for an 8yo and a house I don't even live in. I also have Jack in a private school.  This summer Jack wanted to go to a sleepaway camp. It's for six weeks and I could only afford two even though it's a three week minimum. He left last week. Out of the blue, the camp called me up and said someone wanted to sponsor Jack for the whole summer. I was confused. They said a pair of angels heard of my hardship and wanted to help out. I said I wouldn't even consider unless they told me who was paying for it. Eventually they said it was the parents of a boy who is an acquaintance of my son. They act like they're better than everyone and come from old money. I've heard them say nasty things about the people that they've helped. I reached out to them and said my finances are none of their business and I'm not their charity case. I'm not here to make feel better about themselves. They were taken aback by my response and asked me to think of Jack. I said your attitude proves my point. For the record, Jack has a fun summer planned out which includes many playdates and trips with his cousins and his other uncle is taking him to Legoland in a couple weeks. He's not working in the mines this summer. Edit: The house was half paid off when I took possession if it. It costs me $400 a month to keep it. I would have lost like 80k before the mortgage is paid off. But the house can easily sell for a million.  Why would I sell a house at loss when I can keep it at a loss but then sell it at a gain in 15 years? Edit: You damn right that the house is mine.  Why shouldn't I be compensated for raising my nephew? So he should get his 250K AND a house whereas I find myself in debt at 53? He's already starting off at an advantage and if I should die then he'd get the house or whatever I have from selling it.  It's a small compensation to have saved him from going to foster care. I'm sure my brother and my nephew would want me to have the house for putting my entire life and future on hold to raise him. ",

        "selftext": "I (28M) have a gf (28F) that just recently decided to sign up for a half-marathon come December. The reason why she signed up is because she doesn\u2019t want to go to an event that\u2019s also happening that day so she has a built-in excuse (That\u2019s pretty wild to me). She asked me beforehand and I told her I thought that was a bad idea. She doesn\u2019t like running (nor does she runs) and she could find another excuse that isn\u2019t running a half-marathon. She still signed up anyways. She then told me that she will follow a 12-week plan for running the half-marathon that was given to her with her inscription. Here\u2019s the thing, I\u2019m a runner in an elite running club, I\u2019ve run over a dozen half-marathons and countless 5ks and 10ks in my life. This summer I ran a 10k and a half-marathon. I finished 5th overall in the 10k, and 12th in my category for the half-marathon. I\u2019m by no means a \u201cgood\u201d runner (good as in make a living running) but I do know what I\u2019m talking about.  She\u2019s often talked about wanting to get \u201cin shape\u201d which I\u2019ve always encouraged but never pushed for (it\u2019s not my place). About a month ago she started to go to Barre classes and she\u2019s enjoying them quite a bit (I\u2019ve gone with her a couple times too), so I assumed that going to Barre classes was the final motivation she needed to sign up for the half-marathon. Anyways, I advised her to start walking and jogging now before she starts the 12-weeks program. I told her that she needs to build a cardio-base before she takes on a half-marathon program that includes jogging, repetitions, intervals, long-distance, hills, etc. She doesn\u2019t want to because she\u2019s not willing to stop going to Barre classes and she gets tired doing two workouts a day. I told her that a half-marathon is a *lot* mileage and that she needed to get extra prepared so she doesn\u2019t get injured in the race. She said she\u2019s not interested in achieving a \u201cgood time\u201d and just that she wants to finish, even if it\u2019s walking. Also that she has a cardio base from playing basketball growing up (she stopped playing basketball 8 years ago). I told her that she made this commitment and that she should take it more seriously, 12-weeks for a half-marathon is a pretty standard program when you have been running and you want to hit your peak in the race, not when you\u2019re about to start from scratch. That was the last straw and she got really upset with me saying that I was trying to put her down, not being supportive of her, and that it\u2019s not easy for her when her boyfriend is in great shape and she isn\u2019t. At that point I apologized for making her feel that way and that I would drop it. I do feel that I need to find a better way to approach it but I want to know was I the Asshole?",

        "selftext": "My (36F) daughter\u2019s (13F) birthday was last weekend. There\u2019s this trampoline park in town that offers sleepover parties where the kids could play for a few hours, watch a movie, and have a sleepover on the trampolines. Her school is very small, so there are only 20 students in her entire year. When we were booking the event, she said to only book 19 places. I asked her if she was sure she wasn\u2019t missing out someone, but she assured me there were only 19 kids in her class, and I was just misremembering. Fast forward to her birthday, and this girl \u201cKamilla\u201d shows up with an entire box full of gifts: teddy bears, perfume, candles, nail polish, flowers, chocolates, etc. I remembered picking up my from school at the beginning of the school year and seeing her chatting and being very friendly with Kamilla, so I assumed they were quite good friends. When Kamilla went up to hug my daughter and wish her a happy birthday, she lightly pushed her away and told Kamilla she couldn\u2019t attend as we forgot to book her place. I apologised to Kamilla and her mother and offered to talk to the people in charge and pay for her place, but my daughter insisted that Kamilla couldn\u2019t come. Kamilla was very distraught over this and started sobbing. I pulled my daughter aside and asked her why Kamilla couldn\u2019t join, even though they used to be friendly and she\u2019d invited every other student in her year. She said that Kamilla was just really weird, obsessive, and creepy, and she didn\u2019t want to be friends with her anymore. I asked her if Kamilla was bullying her, and she said no, she just didn\u2019t want to be around Kamilla. Kamilla\u2019s mother had found out about the party through another parent and Kamilla decided to surprise my daughter knowing she hadn\u2019t been given an invite. I returned the gifts to Kamilla, apologised again, and gently told her that there weren\u2019t enough spaces. Her mother started screaming at me, telling me that I was a grown adult woman bullying a preteen girl. I told her that it was my daughter\u2019s birthday party, she could invite whoever she wanted. She accused me of raising my daughter to be a bully, and that she couldn\u2019t just invite the entire class and exclude one girl. She claimed that Kamilla was my daughter\u2019s \u201cbest friend\u201d and she had to right to be invited. I told her that my daughter\u2019s a teenager, not a 5 year old, she can\u2019t be forced to invite the entire class just to be nice. I said that I didn\u2019t want to raise a doormat. I didn\u2019t want to teach her to value the feelings of others at the expense of her own - if my daughter feels uncomfortable around someone, then I prioritise HER wellbeing over that of a stranger\u2019s. Kamilla\u2019s mother is now talking to the teachers to punish my daughter for \u201cbullying\u201d. I\u2019ve tried explaining to her that my daughter was simply setting her boundaries, she shouldn\u2019t have to face consequences for that. Kamilla\u2019s mother said that I was an \u201cevil b*tch\u201d who \u201ctook joy in bullying little girls\u201d. AITA?",

She\u2019s also very competitive. My husband is also very competitive.  My daughter started off this vacation by telling my husband there was sudoku on the plane and explaining how to play. He didn\u2019t know that she\u2019s been playing sudoku for months. She made a bet with him that if she finishes the hardest level first, he\u2019d buy her wifi for the flight and if he finished first she\u2019d share a bed with his younger daughter on the trip (his younger daughter was complaining about sharing with his oldest because she kicks and sleeps in the middle of the bed. She beat him and pestered him until he bought the wifi.  When we got there she\u2019d challenge him to races on land and in the pool (she\u2019s won medals at state track meets and has been swimming since she was 2). Every day she\u2019d challenge him to something, win, and he\u2019d have to buy her something from the resort or local shops.  My husband was getting sick of losing and my stepdaughters were upset that their dad was buying her stuff and not them so I told my daughter she either couldn\u2019t compete with her stepdad or she had to let him win.  She decided to tell her stepdad that she wasn\u2019t allowed to compete with him anymore because he couldn\u2019t handle losing. This made them start to argue so I told her that if she didn\u2019t keep it up she\u2019d be grounded to the resort for the rest of the trip (a little over a week at this point). She decided to test me so I stuck to my word and she was left at the resort while the rest of us went out every day.  The vacation was much more enjoyable without her turning everything into a competition but she told her dad when she got back that we grounded her and he\u2019s mad at me now for leaving her there and excluding her from the vacation because my husband couldn\u2019t act like an adult.  I told him my daughter was warned to stop but she decided to test me and now he\u2019s forcing her to stick to the custody schedule (technically I have her every other weekend but he was letting her go back and forth whenever she wanted) and is threatening to go to court for child support and back pay.

        "selftext": "I have 2 stepdaughters, Scarlett (18), and Ava (16).  Scarlett is an amazing singer. She's been in some kind of voice lessons since she was 10 and just graduated from one of the best performing arts schools in the state, where she went on a full scholarship since 6th grade. She has a YouTube channel where she sings that she's starting to make money from and was accepted into some very prestigious music schools. Additionally, she has been working paid gigs for the last 2 years and makes at least $500-1000 per week, more in the summers. She's even been the opening artist at a few concerts. I'm not trying to brag, I'm just saying she's an objectively good singer.  Ava, on the other hand, is not a good singer. She likes to believe she is and she might become one if she actually stuck with voice lessons or choir classes but she always quits after 1-2 weeks because they're bullying her (giving constructive feedback, I've seen the notes her classmates and teachers have given her).  Ava also likes to sing very loudly and/or at bad times. For example, if she feels that we're too quiet at the dinner table she starts to loudly sing. It doesn't sound good and I honestly don't know how she doesn't hear it. If you ask her to stop she keeps going and if you're blunt and say stop, that doesn't sound good/we don't want to hear it she keeps going and gets even louder just to annoy you.  If we're in the car and we don't let her choose the songs she'll loudly sing whatever she wants, not what's playing, to annoy us and responds the same way to us telling her to stop. The only person she listens to is her dad.  A few weeks ago we were trying to eat and she was singing again. I told her to stop and she refused so I took her plate and told her from now on she is no longer allowed to eat at my table. She can eat in her room, the backyard, her car, the garage, wherever she wants as long as we can't hear her from the dining room and that this will continue until she can behave appropriately at the table.  My husband and I argued about it but he's not home for dinner so there isn't much he can do about it. Today she was eating lunch with us and started singing again. I told her to stop and she didn't listen so I again took her plate and told her to eat somewhere where we can't hear her if she doesn't want to act appropriately. Ava argued that she's a better singer than Scarlett and that Scarlett sings all the time. I was done with her bullshit so I asked her how many times someone other than her dad has actually asked her to sing, not even paying her to be there, just ask her to sing or how many performing arts schools she's gotten accepted to (she's applied to many). She started to cry and my husband wants me to apologize for being rude to her and is insisting I allow her to eat with the family again. AITA?",

        "selftext": "I (22f) have an older brother (John-32m) who has been with his fianc\u00e9 (Jane-30f) for 4 years. They have a 4 month old. Jane found out she was pregnant at 5 and a half weeks and immediately called my mum to tell her. Mum was confused, but still very excited. Jane said she was going to tell John when he got back from his work trip. A few hours later, she called again, sobbing, saying she has \u2018insatiable cravings\u2019. Mum made a joke like \u2018isn\u2019t it a bit early for cravings?\u2019 and Jane went OFF on her. She started yelling about how this was \u2018her pregnancy\u2019 and no one else\u2019s. It was an odd reaction. she also apologised for her outburst by blaming it on hormones. When my brother returned from his trip, him and Jane left to stay at her mother\u2019s and we didn\u2019t see her until after the baby was born. John said this was because Jane was afraid of losing the pregnancy and wanted to be with her mum and we needed to respect boundaries. Whenever someone would ask about Jane or the baby, they would shut it down with vague answers like \u2018Every pregnancy is different\u2019 or \u2018She\u2019s carrying small, which isn\u2019t unusual\u2019. They barely shared anything about the pregnancy. No ultrasound pictures, no baby shower, and Jane didn\u2019t want anyone around during the delivery. I also discovered that every craving she listed, came from one article about pregnancy cravings (she even listed multiple items in the same order as the article). When the baby was born, we were finally allowed to see Jane and John (and baby of course). It was very bittersweet as we all wished we could have been there for Jane to help out, but Jane and John both reassured us that we did help out by staying away during the pregnancy. The weirdest part though, is how Jane describes the birth. She claims she had an epidural via IV drip into her HAND (edited bc I didn't elaborate--)\u2026 which is NOT how those are administered. When I asked clarifying questions (thinking she had gotten confused, which is understandable) she shut down and refused to answer, like how she would during the pregnancy. She said the baby had 'latching issues' because he was born with no umbilical cord stump. This can technically happen, but it\u2019s a rare and fatal medical condition that their baby does not have. The final straw was when she told us that the baby \u2018basically fell out of her\u2019 within an hour of being in labour, despite my brother telling us how hard the birth was (and even stating that was why they weren\u2019t going to try for any more kids). Mum is on the same side as me, and has been noting this inconsistencies and inaccuracies but doesn\u2019t know how to bring it up. And their reactions don\u2019t help. A few days ago, my brother text mum saying her doubt of Jane is disrespectful and they both want full apologies from the both of us for 'bullying' Jane about her pregnancy/labour. I haven't made any outright accusations about it, nor have I said any of this to Jane. I've only asked questions when she brings the birth/pregnancy up. AITA for having doubts?",

You just put your foot forward and let gravity do all the work. Walking uphill conversely is very draining and leaves me sweaty. I don't make a point to complain about something when I do it, so when I was walking uphill, despite not liking it much, I held basic conversation with my brother.  As we were heading back down, he asked me if I was having fun and I said no. Not because of any fault of my brother, I just didn't find the activity fun. Not even bad, just satisfactory. Later when he was driving me to the airport for my flight home he told me If I ask you if you're having fun, don't say 'no.'

        "selftext": "Background: I (42M) have a son \u201cJack\u201d (22M) and a daughter \u201cCassie\u201d (7F) from two different marriages. I had Jack with my first wife \u201cPenelope\u201d who passed away when Jack was 9. This hit both of us hard. I thought Penelope and I were going to be together forever. It took me a long time to be ready to date again, which I started doing when Jack was 14. He wasn\u2019t happy about it. I met my first girlfriend, my current wife, \u201cSara\u201d through work. We dated for a few months before birth control failed and Sara became pregnant. Because of that, our relationship progressed very fast. She moved in with Jack and I by the time she was four months pregnant.\u00a0 Jack was understandably very upset, but bother Sara and I wanted our child to grow up in a two parent household. Unfortunately, due to lack of space, we also had to move out of the apartment I shared with my late wife. Jack was put in therapy to help him adjust.\u00a0 However, Jack and I did luck out a bit with Sara. Sara made it a point to have prominent memorabilia of Penelope because of her awful step-mother all but erased Sara\u2019s mother.\u00a0 After Cassie (my daughter) was born, Jack wanted nothing to do with her, which was understandable, but upsetting.\u00a0 However, Cassie\u2019s maternal cousin \u201cWill\u201d (18M)\u00a0 adored her from day one, and happily stepped into that brother role. Frequent hangouts, played with her dolls, etc. He even has a matching (i think) hello-kitty necklace with her, and uses it as his good luck charm for his sport.\u00a0 This was the first year both Jack and Will left for college. Jack messed around during highschool and had crappy grades and no scholarships. While I would be able to pay, I refused to pay 50k/year+ for him to screw around. So, he went to community college for two years and this year transferred to a good school. Will was an A student as well as an excellent athlete, and got an almost full ride to a far away school.\u00a0 Thankfully, both boys were able to come home for Thanksgiving. Jack came home first. She greeted him without much fanfare, but was still happy he was home. This was very different from how she greeted Will. She waited at my SIL\u2019s house for him, made a huge glittery sign, and started bawling her eyes out when she saw him.\u00a0 My sister-in-law posted the video of them reuniting on Facebook, and Jack saw the video and was very upset at the difference in Cassie\u2019s \u201cwelcome home\u201d enthusiasm. After listening to this for the fifth time, I snapped at him and told him these were the consequences of his actions, i.e. doing nothing to make a bond with his sister for the past seven years. He got pissed and stormed off to his room. Since then my former in-laws have been ringing my phone off the hook yelling at me and demanding I reprimand my daughter for her lack of enthusiasm at his return. Cassie doesn\u2019t know why, but she can tell her brother is upset at her and it is affecting her. Will is pissed that Jack is making Cassie upset. I don\u2019t know what to do.\u00a0 ",

He spends the majority of his free time in his room on his laptop; he hardly leaves the house besides just going to work. He doesn't have any other hobbies or interests. He doesn't make an effort himself to engage with people and reach out to people. He isolates himself from everyone. I told him you can't expect people to include you and reach out to you when you hide in your room all day and you don't make an effort yourself to engage with people.

        "selftext": "My husband (38M) and I (37F) have been married for 9 years and have 2 kids (8 & 6). He works a hybrid schedule so he's home 2-3 days a week. I'm a nurse at an understaffed hospital. Due to that staffing shortage, I was offered to temporarily switch my work hours to the overnight shift. It came with a nice bump in pay which could really help us out financially. My husband was very much against it because of the changes it would make to our day-to-day lives. I initially declined the offer but they countered with an even higher pay bump, so I took it. It's been 5 months since I changed hours and my husband hates it. My hours are now 10pm-8am M-Thu and midnight-9am Sunday morning. I usually make it home just in time to see the kids off to school, run some errands or get things done at home in the morning, then sleep until the kids' bedtime and head to work. I like to think I've gotten pretty efficient at it since the change, but my husband disagrees. I won't lie, he has had to pick up a lot of kid-related things that we used to share. Pretty much any rides they need are done by him. Any weekday activities he takes care of. Now that the kids are done with school we have them in a summer daycare program and he does all the drop-offs and pick-ups. He's been complaining to me ever since the kids' school year ended that this isn't working for him anymore. He keeps asking when I can switch my hours back. I told him that the original plan was 6-8 months so it could be soon, but it's only been 5 months. If I'm being honest, I don't know if I want to switch back. I'm making and saving a lot more money. Once I adjusted to the sleep schedule, I feel like I actually have more energy and can get more stuff done when I get home from work. This past weekend, my husband practically begged me to ask my supervisor when I can switch my hours back. I finally told him that I'm not sure if I want to do that. He flipped out on me. He told me this isn't what he signed up for when we got married. He told me he feels lied to because not only did I accept the offer without his final approval but now I'm going back on my word that it would be temporary. He said that if I'm going to keep my current night shift, then I need to do more things at home since I have the whole place to myself during the day. I asked him what more he thinks I should do and he actually made a list. He put pretty much all the yard work on there, which is usually stuff he takes care of and that I don't know how to do. I told him I don't know how to do all of that stuff and he told me If I can learn how to fold a fitted sheet, you can learn how to mow the lawn. I told him that doesn't seem like a fair division of labor and he told me that he's taken on all the kid stuff so I need to do more of everything else. I told him that doing manual labor after I worked all night isn't going to work for me and he told me to change my hours back then.",

Before we had kids, my wife  and I had lots of ideas about the parents we were going to be and we had lots of scorn for people who parented in ways we disagreed with but, as any parent knows, actually raising kids is hard work and you will break your values.  My brother (22M) is doing a psychology degree, with a few modules on child psychology and development. He regularly tells me that he thinks ipad kids are spoiled brats who will struggle developmentally and they are the spawn of lazy, negligent parents.  I wouldn't say my kids are ipad kids but they do have an ipad between the 3 of them and more screen time that I would ideally like but sometimes thems the breaks.  My brother also disapproves of the fact we give our kids sweets as bribes (occasionally) and have lied to our kids. Every time he tells me his views on parenting I just laugh and tell him to try being a parent, then I'll take his advice.  Recently, due to an emergency, my wife and I needed a babysitter for a whole day so I called my brother because, despite his judgement, he is actually very good with our kids.  When we got home in the evening the kids were in bed having had dinner and we thanked him profusely. He very ernestly told us that, now he had experienced being a parent, he realised that not letting your kids use screens was very easy and they hadn't watched TV or used their ipad in the 12 hours he'd been there. He also said he'd calmed their fears (they had been aware of the emergency a little bit), read to them, not had to bribe them to do anything with sweets and he'd dealt with very calm relaxed children, as opposed to the brats they normally are when they're with me (his words). He gave us a 20 minute lecture about our bad parenting and now that he was in a position to give advice he was going to give it.  We'd been planning on giving him \u00a3200 to thank him for doing this for us short notice and looking after the kids for so long but we sent him on his way without any pay.  the next day I called him up to tell him I thought his behaviour was incredibly inappropriate, that I appreciated him looking after the kids but it was better he didn't see them for a while and that him springing that all on us especially after a day of stress showed how immature he really was. I told him that he actually didn't know anything about parenting because he wasn't a parent. I concede I may have gone too far but my mum called me up later to tell me my brother was crying and she called me a dickhead because he was just trying to help and apparently I'm a bad parent for dealing with peoples kindness so rudely.

        "selftext": "Throwaway account for personal reasons. I (F45) have a 14-year-old daughter, who I'll call Mikaela. Mikaela has barely hit puberty and is less developed than the majority of her peers, which I believe is something she is self-conscious about. Last week, my husband and I received an email from Mikaela's school saying that because it was approaching the summer, it would now be mandatory for all students to shower after PE. I understand the logic; Mikaela does PE before lunch and if she doesn't shower, she'll be sweaty for the rest of the day, which I don't believe is hygienic. The school requested that we pack a towel and any shower gel for the next PE lessons to ensure the students were ready. When I mentioned this to Mikaela, she said she would refuse to shower. Since the showers are communal, she told me she did not want to be naked in front of everyone else and would just get dressed. I told her she couldn't do this as the school were enforcing it, plus I felt it was healthy for her to shower. Again, she asked me to email the school to say she wouldn't be participating, but I refused to do so. On Friday, despite many protests, I managed to make Mikaela go to school with her towel/shower stuff packed. I felt like I was doing the right thing. However, when Mikaela got home, she'd been crying all day saying how she'd had to get naked in front of everyone to shower and she'd never been so embarrassed because she saw one or two of the girls laughing at her. I told her how sorry I was and that teenage girls are horrible and that she's beautiful, but for hygiene reasons, she still has to shower. I suggested bringing in a swimming costume to wear to shower in, but she said that would bring even more attention to her. She begged me to email to school to not let her shower, but I said I had no good reason to, and I'm sure all of the other girls feel the same. She told me she hated me and has barely spoken to me the rest of this weekend. My husband feels I should send an email as it doesn't hurt and Mikaela is clearly bothered, but I don't think it's a big deal, she will eventually get over it, and it's important for hygiene reasons.

We were supposed to be her, the groom, me (as a Maid of Honor) and a Best man, plus a few close family member, about 10 people in total, and it was planned for early November.  I say wedding like that in the title because there will be no invites, no save the date, no ceremony, no walk down the isle, just courthouse and dinner (that comes from the bride herself, I'm not guessing anything).  A week ago I got the news that I had gotten a permanent job, I don't know how to explain it because this is a very typical thing from my country, Spain, where  every  so often, the government will hire professionals to work either in the administration or in public institutions (education, highschool...) This is usually a great opportunity because these positions are for life (well, until you retire) and they can never fire you. In order to apply for these positions, you have to take an exam, and then depending on your years of service to the institution and the score you get on the exam, you can get one of those jobs.  Long story short, I took my exam last year and last week I got told that I got one of the jobs, but I will be moving cities for that.  When I told my friend this, the only thing she said is when are you leaving?? Can you still come to my wedding? No congratulations, no i'm happy for you, nothing.  I must add, two weeks ago I talked to her to know where were we having dinner for her wedding, and she said she didn't have anything planned yet, let alone booked. Had she told me she had everything booked and that she really needed my RSVP,  i would've understood her answer, but in that context, I've decided that if the only thing she cares about is her and her wedding, and she can't be happy for me, I'm not going to the wedding.

I have heard like five word the whole time I have been here and it was when she was talking to her mom. I ask if she is interested in the car and her mom answer.  I told my sister I asked Luna and wait for Luna to respond. I repeat the question and she doesn\u2019t give an answer and just looks at her mom. I inform both of them I am not willing to sell my car if the person buying it can not communicate with me.  So I ask again what she thinks of the car, she turns around and walks inside. I informed my sister I will not be selling Luna the car. We get into an argument that I shouldn\u2019t have put her on the spot and I know she is shy. I point out that it her daughter can not communicate and she will be eaten alive at college . I told her I will be willing to sell it to Luna if she contacts me. My sister called me a jerk  Update: I received a call form dad ( my Bil). I don't know what is going on in that family but he made it very clear to not sell the car to anyone ( I wasn't going to anyways)  In short Luna can not afford it and they are on debt. I don't know the specifics of what is happening so I am going to stay out of that. I will be selling my car to the dealership ",

        "selftext": "Edit- I have the kids more than her, she has them for an hour in the morning and I have them for 2-3 every night. Also everyone saying. Don't know the stress of the morning shift. I have literally done it for 2 years. She is the one that wanted the morning shift because of her schedule For everyone saying have you asked what is wrong, yes she doesn't give an answer  I need an outisde opinion to this. My wife and I have two kids that are both in daycare. My wife will take the morning shift, which includes getting the kids up, getting breakfast and to the daycare. I handle the night shift which is getting the kids from daycare, doing dinner and starting to get them ready for bed. Usally she gets home around 6:30-7 and the whole family has like 30 minutes together before the kids bedtime. We usally spend reading to them. She has to travel an hour+ ( depends on traffic)to work each way.  So the kids are getting at daycare at 8 in the morning and I will pick them up around 4. I work from home and start around 7 and end around 3-3:30. The issue is around brekafast, we agreed that I would make dinner each night and she does breakfast. She already makes food for the kids so it's literally just making an extra one of what she is already making.  For the past month she will either not make it at all for me, not tell me that it is done ( I have asked her to just give a general time but she keeps switching up the schedule). One day the are eating a 7 in the morning and then getting dressed other days she is giving them toast before getting into the car. I have talked to her multiple time and explained that it is not considerate.  We got into an argument and she told me I am home so just make my own food. I explained I may be home but I am doing my job. Yesterday she didn't make anything and I had enough. She came home and I didn't make her anything for dinner. When asked I told her she is home and can make her own food. This started a huge argument and she called me a jerk. ",

Even on our two salaries, my husband and I wouldn\u2019t ever be able to afford a home like this, even though we are pretty frugal and have savings. The housing market if tough, and we were extremely fortunate. My half sister Ella 25F from my dad and I are very close, and she landed a new job in the city centre. On her salary, she can\u2019t afford to rent a place in the city centre area, and living on the outskirts and paying for a train there and back isn\u2019t cost effective.  She asked me if she could move in, as this was her dream industry and although the pay wasn\u2019t great it was for experience and once she\u2019d saved enough she could get on her own feet.  Ella got laid off around Christmas, and had been trying really hard to find work, so I offered her the guest bedroom. She said she\u2019d help around the house. She\u2019s been here a month, and been busy with her new job. I\u2019ve asked her occasionally to help out- make dinner or put the kids to bed if me and my husband are running late and it\u2019s been fine so far. I asked her on her on her WFH day to pick up  my youngest from school as the nurse said she was sick. I couldn\u2019t reach my husband, there was major train delays on so it would take me at least an hour and my house is a 5 minute walk from my kids school. Ella texted me back to say that she was working but she\u2019ll try and pick up her niece when her meeting finished. I got upset- my daughter was sick and Ella said she would try and pick up her after her meeting. I called her to tell her boss that she needed 20 minutes to pick up her niece after a family emergency, and then she could continue.  Ella argues that she still had to work for the rest of the day and she didn\u2019t have to time to babysit her niece. I told her that I expected her to help around the house when she moved in, and she said that she wasn\u2019t free labour.  There\u2019s tension in the house now, and I wanted a second opinion.

Which was fine because I had no intention of involving her too much.  The truth is that Ethan grew up with two dads and three older brothers. We always try to have him spend time with girls. A couple of years ago when Ethan was 9, Beth reached out to see how he was doing. I think she spent the last nine year being an overachiever so she'd feel worthy of having a relationship with Ethan. Ivy league, married a hedge fund dude, yoga, etc. Ethan is incredibly self aware and intellectual. You cannot bullshit him so he and I enjoy a very open relationship. I told him his mom reached out to me and asked about him. I emphasized that she didn't forget him but she had to go away to work on herself. I asked how'd he feel about talking with her and he said he was open to it.  They have a good relationship and spend time together. He's met her husband. It's been a good thing to know his bio family.  Ethan is starting 6th grade and he has to pick an elective class. There has been arguments about what that class will be. Anyways,he told Beth about it and she fucked up by getting involved with the matter. She said what's the big deal about his doing yearbook. He should do what he wants to do. It's his class. I was like you got me fucked up. I said girl you are not his mom. You're more like a siblings and siblings don't get a say in parenting decisions. You take a backseat. You're a seat filler in the life of Ethan. Just don't forget your place.  She didn't say anything and went radio silent. I was the bigger person and reached out. I said I've been raising that kid for 11 years so it was triggering for you to give your two parenting cents. You need to understand that. He understands that so you should too.  I guess she's waiting for ME to apologize for something she did. I will not. Once you do that then everything goes bad.",

        "selftext": "So I recently found out that my boyfriend has been buying and drinking raw (unpasteurized) milk. He grew up on a farm and apparently his family always drank it straight from the cow, and he's been doing the same ever since we moved in together. At first I didn\u2019t think much of it (being a vegan I never drank it myself) but I started doing some research after I saw the label on it literally says not for human consumption. Apparently raw milk can carry harmful bacteria like salmonella, E. coli, and listeria. I freaked out when I read that, I don't want him to get sick or expose me to something dangerous. So, when I saw a fresh bottle of raw milk in our fridge yesterday I panicked and poured the entire bottle down the drain. I thought it was the safest thing to do. When my boyfriend got home he immediately noticed and was pissed. He said he spent a lot of money on that milk and that he\u2019s been drinking it for years without a problem. He accused me of not trusting him and said I had no right to throw away something he enjoys just because I disagree with it. I tried explaining that I was just concerned for his health and ours, but he said I was being a control freak. Now he's barely talking to me and I feel like there\u2019s this huge distance between us. AITA for pouring out the milk? I thought I was doing the right thing but I'm starting to wonder if I overstepped.",

These porcelain dolls were around when I was a child and I had memories of getting in trouble for playing with them. They were absolutely beautiful. Well, when my mother died I (29F) decided to keep ONE doll, I know it wasn\u2019t left to me, but I felt like they meant more to me than they could to my niece. I contemplated giving it back to her when she was old enough to appreciate it. We\u2019re from Louisiana and hurricane Laura hit \u2026 when we evacuated. I took the doll with me because I knew it was sentimental and irreplaceable. My niece, however let all of the remaining five dolls get ruined in hurricane because she let them in the house when where got ruined. My twin sister (Jays mom) thanks that it\u2019s only fair that I give Jay the doll. I kept safe because after all it was left for her\u2026. My argument is that if I would have gave her the doll, it would have gotten ruined with the other ones because she didn\u2019t care enough about them to take them her with her. Fast-forward, we are now in 2025 and I have a daughter of my own. I 100 % believe if my mom would have known she was gonna have another granddaughter she would have left a doll to her. AITA? ",

        "selftext": "I (35F) am a single mother to 2 kids (5 & 3).  Both my kids are in daycare and over the years I have built a solid friend group with a handful of other moms and our kids regularly get together for play dates.  The father of my kids is not in the picture at all and my relationship with him is non-existent.  This is 100% for the best and I am currently in therapy to deal with a lot of things that my ex did to me.  This friend group has literally been a lifesaver for me at times.   A few months ago, there were 2 new kids that started at our daycare center.  They are similar in age to my kids and were placed in the same classes as them.  I noticed that their dad was the only parent to ever pick up or drop off the kids.  He would try to make small talk with me a few times, but I am uncomfortable around strange men so I would be polite, but not engage further than that.   Our mom group has a group chat that we use to support each other and arrange play dates.  A few weeks ago, one of the moms texted the group chat that she was adding this new dad to our group chat because he wanted to have his kids participate in play dates outside of daycare.   I privately texted that other mom and told her that I don't feel comfortable with a man I don't know having my contact information and told her that she should have consulted all of us before deciding on her own to add him to our group chat.  I then texted the rest of the moms and told them that I want them to keep a separate group chat without the other dad because I don't know him and it makes me uncomfortable.   This resulted in a lot of divided opinions with about half of the moms agreeing to a separate chat and the other half saying that would be too difficult to keep track of and that it is wrong to exclude another parent just because he's a man and that I'm being unreasonable.   The mom I texted privately replied to me that she has talked with this dad numerous times and that he seems like a nice person and good parent and that his kids shouldn't be excluded if they want to hang out with their friends outside of daycare.  She told me I am being difficult and making this all harder than it needs to be.   The other day when I picked up my kids, my 5-year-old was upset because a bunch of his friends were talking about a playdate that he wasn't invited to.  I texted the moms about it and they said that they were getting the kids together with the new dad and didn't invite my kids because of how I was acting.    I told them it was rude to exclude my kids like that and a couple of the moms told me to grow up because that's exactly what I was trying to do to this dad and his kids.   I'm at a loss because these moms have been so supportive to me in the past and as soon as this dad comes into the picture it's like they pulled a 180 and don't seem to care at all.  There are still other moms who agree with me, but now it's like our friend group has been divided by this.  ",

She is a freshman and has been with her boyfriend Steve for 3 years. Steve is really a great kid, but since money is a bit tighter in his family, he is doing 2 years at junior college while working to save up for the school my daughter attends. We have never taken him on a trip, but since he says money is right, we decided to bring him with on our visit to see our daughter. He visited her once on his own back in the fall, but due to his finances he wouldn\u2019t be able to afford another trip this school year. He was over the moon when we invited him.  We don\u2019t want him to pay for a single thing. His flight, his hotel room (he will be sharing with our son, they get along really well) and his food and drink will all be paid for by us. And really we are glad to do it. We\u2019ve also never really had a disagreement with Steve until now.  When speaking to my daughter about plans, the hotel came up. This is when I found out that my daughters dorm roommate is out of town that weekend. And she plans to have Steve stay in her dorm with her while we visit. I told her absolutely not. I said what they do when we aren\u2019t there is their business, but since we are going to be there and funding this whole trip, he will be staying at the hotel. Call my husband and I old school, or traditionalists, but we are Christians. And the idea of them staying together on our visit makes us uncomfortable. We think we are being rather generous to take him in the first place.  The word got back to Steve and he actually called me and asked why he couldn\u2019t stay with our daughter. I explained my reasons above and he got irate. He tried to pull the \u201cadult\u201d card. I said Steve,  here is the deal. If you wanna stay with her, that\u2019s fine. You will still be welcome to tag along with our family. But there will be separate checks on every meal. And he could figure out his own way there. He said we know he can\u2019t afford that. And I said all we ask is that you sleep at the hotel. He agreed but now my daughter is saying we embarrassed him and he\u2019s thinking of not coming.",

A couple of weeks ago, she told me she likes to get Chinese food on Black Friday because her family used to do that, and it\u2019s a tradition she doesn\u2019t get to do anymore. Initially, I dismissed it, saying we should eat leftovers since my mom likes us to stick around and eat with everyone. I also didn\u2019t want to leave others out. But she convinced me it was important, so I told my mom on Wednesday night that we wanted to go out on Friday. My mom was visibly upset. I looked to my girlfriend and asked if we could move it to Sunday instead. She agreed. Fast forward to Friday around 4:30 pm, and she told me she was upset that I didn\u2019t care about her feelings. I was confused because I thought we had resolved it by moving it to Sunday. She said she still wanted to go out on Friday, so I said, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d But then she said she didn\u2019t want to go anymore because she had eaten a big breakfast. I suggested we get takeout later, but she said it was fine, and we didn\u2019t go. Later in the car, she had a mature conversation with me about needing to learn how to let things go, and I thought that was the end of it. However, this morning (Sunday), she brought it up again and said she was still upset that I \u201cdismissed her feelings.\u201d She also revealed that this tradition is tied to her late grandfather, who passed away three years ago, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s so meaningful. She said she thought we were making fun of her for wanting Chinese food, which we weren\u2019t. I told her I wished she\u2019d said something earlier because we absolutely would have gone if I\u2019d known how important it was to her. She says she\u2019s not mad at me now, but I still feel like she is. She also said I should\u2019ve \u201cread between the lines.\u201d I feel like I tried to make it work on Friday and genuinely thought we had a plan for Sunday. Did I mess this up? AITA?

So when my brother Jake M(21) asked me to photograph his wedding, I of course agreed. My brothers wife, Chelsea(22) is a very kind woman, however her stylistic choices can sometimes be a bit wild. I do not judge at all because I know innovation is part of self expression. Chelsea showed me her wedding makeup, and she had these vibrant green contacts on. They looked extremely reptilian on her due to it not matching her undertone. When she showed me the picture, I told her she looked lovely, but that the contacts weren't the best. She seemed a bit offended, and told me she just wanted to look exotic like you. I offered to find her some more natural contacts but she wouldn't relent. On her wedding day, as I took pictures, the contacts looked even worse, like a neon green light up sign. When Jake was free for a moment, I showed him a few pictures. He called Chelsea over, and she seemed to be happy with the pictures, while Jake seemed a bit iffy. Chelsea asked what I thought, and I told her she looked stunning, but I then asked if she'd like me to edit the contrast a bit in the pictures. She then got extremely defensive, and accused me of calling her ugly on her own wedding day. Of course that was not my intention, but I left early to prevent a scene.   Edits to answer some questions:   1. The bride was not being racist with the exotic comment, English is her second language, I just look unconventional.   2. I left the wedding at 1am instead of 3, they had lots of pictures taken by me   3. I asked her about the edits at the wedding itself as she wanted them posted ASAP on my account and hers. I didn't want her to receive rude comments from our relatives, my followers or anything like that, but I also didn't want her to be edited without consent.   Finally, here is what the contacts looked like, [https://www.moonfunmakeup.com/en-ca/products/silken-green-natural-contact-lenses](https://www.moonfunmakeup.com/en-ca/products/silken-green-natural-contact-lenses)",

Eveyone got there plate and we all jumped in to eating. I saw that my chips was straight cut and my best friends girlfriend ordered Curley fries with her food instead of normal straight cut. Me curious how it tastes just say \u201coh how does your chips taste\u201d and grab one chip of her place. She then looks at me in shock in and says \u201cwtf did you just touch my food?\u201d I then just said oh sorry did you want some of my chips ? Trying to be fair. She then turns to her boyfriend and goes nope I\u2019m not eating. And throws her cutlery on the table and sits back. Me embarrassed as hell next to my date just say I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t know you didn\u2019t like people touching your plate, would you like me to order you a new plate and said sorry.  She then stated being a stubborn as hell and says nope and nope. Even her best friend said she can share her plate with her and she was still being a stubborn as hell. We then just proceeded to eat a little. Table dead ass quiet at this point. Then my best friend said let\u2019s go for a cigarette so we got up from the quiet table and walked to the smoking area. I then proceeded to apologise but he insisted I don\u2019t and that he should apologise for his girlfriend\u2019s actions. Long story short we left the place after we ate and all went home.

        "selftext": "I (20M) am in a computer science course for college on operating systems. I was assigned this randomn group project partner (20F) and we were working on a project for most of the semester. We had decided to organize the project in a way that she would do core parts and I would do plug-in modules that depend on her core. However since she did her parts in a convoluted way, it was hard for me to understand it and when I couldn't get it to work she had to do them as well. We got into an argument and she claimed it wasn't convoluted. I then paid a tutor who advised me and said he could help but that the project would be easier to do in rust compared to c++. She agreed to redo the project in rust if I converted everything we had so far myself and she'd help out with the last part. We got permission from the prof to do it in rust instead. The tutor then helped me convert her code to rust and which counted as my part.  However when it finally came to doing the last part she said she had no time to work with me on it as she didn't know rust well enough and had some ballet competition the weekend of the deadline. She offered to finish it in the C++ version but I told her it is OK. I then got it done with the help of the tutor and submitted the project. Since the rust code was all written by me in the statement of contribution I had to state that I did all the code and she contributed to the design process and report. However the prof took that as her not contributing as only the code is actually graded and decided to give her a 0 on the project which would lead to her failing the class as it is 70% of the grade.  She now wants me to come talk to the professor with her and is upset at me for refusing. The way I see it it is not really my problem and I don't want to face any trouble and she did already tell the prof that she had done the older c++ code we didn't submit. AITA here? She's pretty upset at me and seems to blame me when it is the profs decision.",

Concert venues she can no longer fit in the chairs, hiking, going to the farmers market, kayaking etc. through all of it we\u2019ve adjusted to accommodate what Jen can do.  A few months ago I moved into a new apartment and got the water tested for heavy metals, nitrate, bacteria, and fluoride through my states health department.

I explain the tests I had done on it so it\u2019s safe and she says it\u2019s not healthy to drink tap water and she can only drink bottled water.

She asked what\u2019s that supposed to mean and I said the past few years I\u2019ve noticed a change in her habits and am concerned she\u2019s going to have more health problems that will one day take her life. I thought when she was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes it might be a wake up call to change her eating and exercise habits but instead she\u2019s focusing on tap water?

We have decided to not include an open bar. I come from an alcoholic heavy family and simply don't feel comfortable being around people who are drinking heavily. Instead, my fianc\u00e9 and I have decided to have a drink ticket like service instead. With that service we've been able to customize how we want alcoholic beverages being handled at our reception and the venue says this kind of service happens all the time there, it was their suggestion in fact, so I didn't think it would be this big of a deal. With the invitations was a card with the expectations one is to expect from the ceremony and the reception. I didn't want to shock people when they arrived so I figured the cards would be a nice, classy heads up for our guests. The drink service bit of the card said, essentially, that alcoholic drinks were limited to two per of age guest, the tickets are non-transferable, and like the other beverages offered would need to be ordered from your seat at your assigned table. Drinks were also to be enjoyed at your assigned table. I've been called a lot of rude things after family (both sides) and friends are receiving their cards. My fianc\u00e9 has as well but a little less so. The most common being bridezilla but I did have an uncle reach out to me and say I'm an a-hole for trying to, spoil the fun of a wedding reception. The response has been mostly negative and has been from all sides of family and friends and now my head is swirling as I try to figure out what to do.

        "selftext": "My (27F) fiance (29M) is an extremely picky eater, and lately, I\u2019ve been feeling really frustrated with his extreme pickiness when it comes to food. He has a very limited diet and refuses to try anything outside of his comfort zone. He doesn't eat meat or vegetables, his diet typically consists of stuff like pizza, macaroni, cereal, and bread with the occasional fruit on the side. This has made it extremely frustrating whenever we eat out. If we're getting something to eat, we have to only go to places that serve anything he wants, which limits our options to mostly just fast food or pizza places. He's offered to go out to other restaurants with me, but he never ends up ordering anything when we do and it's extremely embarrassing. He never eats anything I cook, and typically just sticks to making his own food. This came to a head when we visited my parents last week. We sat down to eat together, they know he doesn't eat meat so prepared a vegetable dish. When we were eating, he only ate a small portion of it, and I could tell from how little he had eaten he wasn't going to finish it. My parents asked what was wrong, and he thanked them for the food, but said he just wasn't that hungry and ended up just fiddling with the rest of it and threw most of it out after dinner. I was mortified. On the way back, he wanted to stop and get food and I kind of laid into him. I told him he embarrassed me, was rude to my parents to not eat the dish, and that he seriously needs to grow up and stop eating like a manchild. This isn't the first time we've had an argument about this, but it is the first time I've been this mad. Last summer we visited my extended family at my uncle's lakehouse, and he basically only ate frozen pizza and cereal the three days we were there, which caused issues since my nieces and nephews were there and I felt it set a bad example for them. He got really hurt and hasn't talked to me much for the past few days. I feel bad, but at the same time, I'm just tired of this. So, AITA? I feel I could have been nicer and more accomodating, but it's not like he has a medical condition that forces him to eat this way. I'm just so tired with him not even being willing to try and continuing to eat like a 5 year old.",

The couple before us got a relatively cute (a bit boring imo) looking cartoon of the two of them but I knew that with these guys the only guarantee is that the outcome is unpredictable. So yeah, my guy starts drawing us while we just kept talking and eating our ice creams. He eventually finishes and shows us the drawing and it looks SICK AF!

I've got big ass ears so in the cartoon i'm like a hybrid human dumbo and my girlfriend looks more realistic (like herself) but her nose has been egregiously exaggerated. She has a **slightly** bigger nose than normal but its only noticeable when its pointed out/actively compared with others. Anyways, I figured she hated it when she was silent during the reveal then walked off. I paid the man for his work, took the art then went after my girlfriend. She explained in the car that he basically reignited her insecurity over her nose and didn't want to see. Alright cool, understood but I already paid for it so I just kept it in my cubicle at work. Long story short, she saw that the art was in my cubicle and we got in a tiff about that because I apparently shouldn't have kept it after she told me how it made her feel.

Her family is much bigger than mine and she wants more of a party type wedding, with lots of music and dancing. My family is all a bit older than hers (she is the oldest sibling while I am the youngest), and they aren't into big, loud weddings. They would prefer something quiet and more focused on socializing, and I would too.  My fiancee said we could do an extended cocktail hour and/or start the reception later so there would be more time for quiet socializing, or even start the whole wedding earlier in the day so it wouldn't go as late. She also suggested that we could take our wedding photos before the ceremony so that we wouldn't have to miss cocktail hour to do them.  I suggested that instead, we find a venue with two separate rooms. That way her family could have a louder party in one, and mine could have a quiet reception in the other. It would be in the same venue so each side could still go over to the other to socialize.  My fiancee said she actually really hates that idea. She said she feels like that defeats the purpose of a wedding, which is supposed to symbolize the union of two people and their families. She also said she doesn't want to do that because she worries I'll spend the entire reception with my family and that she'll have to chose between spending the night with me but ignoring her family, or being with her family but us basically being separate at our wedding. She also said she feels like the wedding we're planning is becoming less and less ours and more mine. She said this because she originally wanted a child-free, non-religious wedding but compromised on a church ceremony with children allowed because that is what I want.  AITA? ",

I moved to London a few months ago and my friend Eleanor from uni was nice enough to introduce me to her group of friends since she grew up here. I\u2019ve spent a lot of time with her friends and they\u2019re slowly becoming my friends too. We spend most weekends together and we even took a spontaneous weekend trip to Spain last month.  There\u2019s this guy in the group who is ridiculously attractive but Eleanor warned me he wouldn\u2019t be interested when I first told her about my crush. She honestly made me think he was gay the way she said it and he always ignores the female attention he gets on nights out so I really did think he was gay. He also doesn\u2019t wear a wedding ring and he\u2019s never brought his wife when we go out, not even when we went to Spain so I was shocked yesterday when I saw him walk over and touch a woman sitting with his best friend\u2019s wife. I asked one of the girls who she was and she told me she was his wife. I was shocked so I blurted out \u201cTHAT\u2019S his wife\u201d? I didn\u2019t mean anything bad about it but I guess my tone showed how shocked I was and Eleanor misunderstood so told me to shut up. The girl I asked was also giving me weird looks so maybe my tone wasn\u2019t what I intended. Eleanor dragged me away from the other girl to tell me not to say anything about his wife because supposedly he\u2019s ridiculously protective over her and the group would quickly turn against me if the guy thought I was saying something negative about his wife which I think is super dramatic. I tried to explain I thought he was gay and that\u2019s why I was shocked but Eleanor thinks I\u2019m lying so she keeps telling me to just be nice to his wife and not say anything bad about her because it would cause problems for her too. I really think she\u2019s being dramatic. Its not like I said she was ugly\u2026 I was just shocked he was married. During the night Eleanor went out of her way to introduce me to his wife but I didn\u2019t say much because Eleanor had made it so awkward for me that I didn\u2019t want to say the wrong thing. She was also really quiet so it was hard to have a conversation with her, especially since her husband or his friend\u2019s wife were always hovering around her. Today they're all hanging out and I wasn't invited. I don't know for sure it was because of this but I think it was...AITA?",

(He sometimes picks the bill up himself but more often it\u2019s the joint account that gets used).  On the way home his daughter and her boyfriend made a point of thanking him directly for the meal and he acknowledged saying something along the lines of \u2018you\u2019re welcome\u2019 or \u2018no problem\u2019.  I didn\u2019t say anything in front of the kids but when home I checked he\u2019d used the joint account, and when he confirmed he had I asked why he\u2019d not corrected the kids that it wasn\u2019t just him that had paid.  He went off at me for ruining a good night and that I was being picky about paying the bill, completely missing my point.  My point wasn\u2019t about money, it was about him taking the credit and not correcting the kids.  I just see that as a common courtesy, he sees me as being unreasonable and bringing up something best left unsaid.  So AITA here? Should I have just let it go?",

        "selftext": "For real last update: I was tipsy and kidding about actually doing that petty stuff though it did cross my mind. I will go to At Home tomorrow and buy her the same candle and put it back atop the toilet. If you\u2019ve read anything I\u2019ve said I have certainly learned my lesson about leaving candles unattended. I will also apologize and ask that she either cut off the wicks or tell me when she has a candle she doesn\u2019t want used as this is a first time thing. We\u2019re fine. Since this candle is already \u201cruined\u201d however, I will be damned if I don\u2019t burn the rest of that fucker down to bottom, after trimming the wicks of course.  Final edit: it IS a fucking candle, like a candle candle. I\u2019ve been at work all night but I got home and just looked at the bottom. Instructions say \u201ctrim wick to 1/4\u201d before lighting\u201d. I did not do this as being the apparent caveman I see candle, I light candle. She\u2019s asleep so I can\u2019t rub it in her face after she said \u201cthat candle isn\u2019t supposed to be lit, they\u2019re not meant for that\u201d, but this is all I need. Am I the asshole for leaving it lit for a quick piss walk before bed with her and the dogs YES. Am an asshole for thinking this stupid thing was in fact a candle NO. The cutting the wick thing was ignorance for not thinking the protective lid that usually comes with a plastic peel around it would\u2019ve prevented someone from lighting it otherwise and they probably should make the damn things ready to go. Here\u2019s a lesson to anyone out there about to light a candle, apparently they have instructions. I now know she was wrong and we never got into a major fight so I will humbly and in the least petty way just leave the candle upside down next the sink so when she wakes up first to brush her teeth she can know that this candle was in fact meant to be lit, and that I was right. I can\u2019t add links or pics here but it\u2019s called Mermaid Shimmer from At Home. I may be dumb but I can hang my hat up knowing I had every right to light it. Good night to all, and have a pleasant tomorrow! Edit 3: holy shit y\u2019all know how to beat a dead horse. I get it, IM AN AH FOR LEAVING THE HOUSE WITH IT. I\u2019ve accepted that. I will be sure to never do it again. Now try imagining the question as in I lit it and sat down on the couch and then it started smoking. AITA then? Gf and I share candles, share a household, and share the financial responsibility for these. They are not \u201chers\u201d they\u2019re \u201cours\u201d. This question was just supposed to be about how in the hell I was supposed to, without being told, know that there was a fake candle I shouldn\u2019t have lit? The label doesn\u2019t even say anything, just \u201chand poured wax. Edit 2: a accept I am the asshole, but still fck those candles Edit: aside from the obvious that I shouldn\u2019t have left with it lit, I take responsibility for that. If all other scented candles are fair game(except if they\u2019re \u201cout of season\u201d, she doesn\u2019t like the house to smell too much like dogs so she likes when I do. The big question here is why tf are there wicks in a decorative candle your going to put above a toilet and not tell me it\u2019s off limits? I went to the bathroom last night and it was stinky. So, being the considerate boyfriend I am I lit the candle my gf left on top of the toilet, and then we went to walk the dogs. The candle looked like most scented candles I\u2019ve seen. Round glass, tan colored wax inside, smelled good, HAD F*ING WICKS. We get back, smoke alarm is going off, house is cloudy but no worse than burning food in the oven. Smokes worse in the bathroom so I blowout the candle and she tells me you\u2019re not supposed to light that candle. WTF, why would it have wicks? Why would she put it on top of the toilet? To me it\u2019s like having a doormat you\u2019re not supposed to step on in front of your door. Do most guys know about this? She seems mad at me, but I told her it\u2019s crazy to do that.

Zach is a very lovely boy and very outgoing. When he came in and saw me he says Emily, I didn't know you have 2 sisters. I laughed as even though it's cliche I know he's trying to be nice. The entire time at dinner he was very polite but he is also a very outgoing kid. He would say stuff such as what a lovely dinner, this food is great, your backyard is beautiful, etc, etc. So while you could say he was trying to be overly polite, he was still a very sweet and kind kid. Emily is a more shy and reserved person so I felt they were really great for each other. Emily is also very sweet and positive, another thing they have in common that I appreciated. My husband also hit it off with him and they were engaging in sports banter, and eventually came to trash talking some football team owner. My older daughter (amy,19), however kept grilling the poor guy. Asking if he would pay for dates, to which he said yeah, and then she asks how he has money, and he said his job, then she started talking about making time for Emily, in between school friends and a job. Then it came onto how they would get to dates and she started asking him about his license, she then started to ask about protecting her making comments on his stature (hes on the shorter side and kind of chubby, like 5'7 and maybe a little overweight, nothing crazy however) and he seemed to be getting uncomfortable so I brought out dessert, which he again complimented, and my husband brought up sports to change topics. After he left I asked her why she would do that. She said that he seemed to nice, and cliche, as if he was faking it. I said so people cant be nice these days? You made it weird for him and Emily, Emily didn't deserve that neither did he. She said that she just didn't like that vibe as no-one is that nice or positive it was definetely forced. Emily butted in and said that she really didnt appreciate that and said that Amy's reasoning didn't make sense. Amy said that she didn't care if it was awkward as she wanted to grill him, and that she doesn't like him because he seemed fake. Emily said, that Amy was messed up and I agreed. Amy then said that he was some dumb weak kid faking being nice, and this upset Emily, and me. Emily then said in a fuss You only say that because your single and no one will date you. She has been slightly sensitive about this as she hasn't been in a committed relationship yet.This upset Amy and Amy asked why I didn't say anything or stop her from going to her room. I said that she just insulted her bf and that she deserved it, she told me I should punish her and was being a bad parent and now Amy isn't talking to me and I feel that maybe a personal insult like that was to far.",

I live in a hot climate and lots of people such as myself wear sandals/crocs/flip flops everywhere. When we got to the restaurant, it turned out they had a dress code, and the hostess loudly told me I couldn't come in wearing crocs. It was extremely embarrassing in front of my coworkers. I don't really understand the problem because there were people wearing sneakers, converse, etc, and that's fine but crocs aren't? It wasn't even a fancy restaurant so I really wasn't expecting this. Anyway, one of my coworkers urged me to go home and change my shoes and come back. I was so distraut I ended up just going home and not coming back. I suffer with anxiety and the whole experience just made me meltdown. My coworkers are now collectively angry at me for leaving and not coming back.

        "selftext": "I understand this is a very sensitive subject and I want to preface by saying I am approaching this as delicately as possible. Any ignorance on my part is not malicious but simply because I don\u2019t know. I (28m) was in a long distance relationship with my gf (25f) for several months before we decided to take the plunge and move in together. She now lives with me. Before she lived with me, we could only visit each other one weekend every month but we called and texted everyday. She moved in with me about 6 weeks ago. For relevant context, I am white and my girlfriend is black. We live a very active lifestyle and we regularly workout, hike, bike, etc. I started to notice that after she would work out and shower, her hair would not be wet and still in braids. I have a sister and I know women don\u2019t always wash their hair everyday so I figured it was that. But then I noticed she still didn\u2019t wash her hair the next week either. Her hair is absolutely beautiful and I love her curls, but whenever I got near her head I could smell that her scalp/hair were dirty and unclean. I personally am very sensitive about smells, especially the smell of a dirty scalp. I have to wash my hair every 1-2 days because I cannot stand the smell of buildup. More time passed and it had now been weeks since my girlfriend washed her hair and while it might be mean to say, I was honestly disgusted. The smell was really bothering me and I brought up the issue to her which caused her to fly off the handle. Granted, I might not have gone about it the best way. I basically asked her point blank when the last time she washed her hair was because it kind of smells bad. She looked at me like I was insane and immediately started calling me racist and ignorant. She informed me black women\u2019s hair is different and doesn\u2019t require frequent washing because it can dry out and damage the follicles. I told her I understand haircare for black women is different, but that doesn\u2019t mean her scalp or hair magically stays clean and doesn\u2019t smell after not washing out the dirt, sweat, oils, and buildup for weeks. This led to her calling me \u201ca dumb fucking racist\u201d and she kept repeating how ignorant and stupid I am. This has really cut me deep because I do not believe I am racist. Ignorant is fair because that is true, I grew up in a predominantly white area and my past girlfriends have all been exclusively white or asian with straight hair texture. I had no exposure and I don\u2019t see why a white guy not knowing about black women haircare is racist. Things with my girlfriend are tense. She has been washing her hair everyday and saying she will blame me for how damaged her hair becomes because I have made her so insecure about the smell. I have apologized profusely but things still aren\u2019t well. I guess I just want an outside perspective.  Edit: For clarity, she did not wash her hair for 5 weeks. This past week she has been washing her hair every day.  Edit 2: For clarity on the conversation, I did not call her \u2018disgusting\u2019 to her face but I felt disgusted by the dirty smell and lack of showering for 5 weeks. I said something along the lines of \u201cHey when was the last time you washed your hair? To be honest it smells a bit bad babe.\u201d",

Ella also suffers from depression and I lot of the house projects she hoped would be done by now aren\u2019t.

Ella has been using the loft area as a reading area, honestly I\u2019m not too sure how much she uses it. I know she read a bit, but mostly when I see her read it\u2019s in bed. Ella has been hard on herself lately, because the kids toys are scattered everywhere so I decided while she was out to have the kids take everything up into the loft area and put all her stuff into her gaming room (we both have our own separate gaming rooms.) The kids LOVE this area and in the time they\u2019ve been playing up there I have seen no toys. Ella came home and started crying saying that was her safe heaven area away from everyone and has been really short with me .She claims that she goes up there everyday and now she can\u2019t just take it away from the kids.

        "selftext": "So I (32F) and my husband (29M) live in an area with an extremely high cost of living. I work a job that pays decently well, which is kind of necessary to live where we do. My husband worked a job for years that paid less than mine did, but was okay overall, though he absolutely hated working there. Around October of last year, my husband managed to get a job in his dream career field. He had been working at it for years, and was really excited about finally getting there. However, it's come with  The big issue is, the pay in his field is abysmal. He works as a freelancer (which is standard in his industry) so his job has zero benefits, and it's a pretty significant pay cut from his old job. We don't have combined finances, and after he took the new job, we had to rearrange how we pay for things to account for his lower income. Previously, he had covered a slightly larger percentage of the expenses due to me having student loans to pay off while he didn't. As it is now, I have to be the breadwinner since his income was basically halved, paying for a larger portion of the expenses. I sat him down recently and told him I felt he needed to quit his job and find a better-paying field because it just wasn't feasible. He got upset, since like I said, this is something he's dreamed of for years and worked really hard to get, which I understand. But I just feel this  isn't fair to me. We've had to cut back on a lot of things and there's not really any sign of a pay increase at this point. I feel like I'm carrying him. He offered to get a part-time job on the side, but I know anything he could get that would be feasible for him while keeping his current job wouldn't provide much. He suggested we move somewhere less expensive, to which I said absolutely not, since we'd have to go quite  a ways to find something in that range and it'd mean ridiculously long commutes to my work and being further away from my family. He offered to have his parents help, which I don't want because it's not a long-term solution. He's extremely upset, and I understand it, because I know he worked hard to get here. If he quit now, it'd basically kill his career and it would be extremely hard for him to get another shot at this job. It's not like we're struggling, which is true, we can pay rent and put food on the table, but I hate feeling like this. I work long days at a rather difficult job, while he works from home doing something he did before as a hobby and only makes half as much money now. My point is that it's not like he has to stop doing what he does altogether, since as I mentioned, he did it as a hobby beforehand, but he's upset because he said this is the only thing he's ever wanted to do career-wise and giving it up now would mean he likely never would be able to make it work. AITA? I understand this is important to him but I'm starting to resent him because I feel like the burden of our finances are being placed on me and we've had to cut back on a lot of things.",

She asked me what that comment was necessary for, and I told her that she knew all of us choose the epidural and shaming us for it is not a good look and that not having an epidural isn\u2019t something to brag about. She told me that it was not her intention to do so, but our friends agreed with me and told her that I was right, if her point wasn\u2019t to bring us down or to brag she could have just avoided to mention it. She just said that she was sorry if she upset us but that she really did not mean it in that way. It became sour so we all decided to leave, I thought she would text us later and apologize but instead her husband sent us a text from her number. He basically told us that Sarah was incredible during birth and would have been with our without an epidural, and that we were the ones shaming her for not having one. We did not respond but instead created another group chat talking about it. What we all agreed on is that she, like many other moms who don\u2019t choose the epidural, didn\u2019t intentionally try to shame us. But that they very often think off themselves as superior, and it was sad that Sarah who is otherwise a very kindhearted person turned out to be this way. We don\u2019t believe we are assholes, but Sarah has not talked with us since and my husband told me that if I thought it was worth ruining a 15 year friendship over then so be it. I would like to know if we are the assholes here, or if Sarah is.",

        "selftext": "Me (37m) and my wife (33f) learned that she is about 8 weeks pregnant. We are delighted but also terrified. It is the first time for both of us. \r  She has asked me to not share the news with anyone until we get to about 12 weeks, when the pregnancy will be stable. So I have been keeping it, even though I really want to share the news with everyone around me. A key detail is that we are currently in long distance: she lives in the same country as her parents, while I am an expat and live alove. She will move in with me and to our new house in one month.  \r  She decided that she would like to tell her parents about her pregnancy before she leaves her home country, so that they can share some of the joy while they are together. This way she can also do one of the ultrasounds with her mother and experience this special connection. This is all understood, and I told her I support her in how she wants to handle the pregnancy information. She did share it with her parents, and they were overjoyed \u2013 the house is in a festive mood, they cannot stop smiling and laughing, etc. \r  I am still under an information embargo though.\r  (note: I did ask her to let me share with a couple of select people, for my own mental sanity, since I really needed to be able to open up to a friend. She was fine with it) \r  Now to the drama. I asked her if I could also tell my parents, to which she responded that she prefers me to wait for the 12 weeks. By that time we will have moved in together in the country where I live. I said fine, but then she asked me that we reveal the news to my parents together, she and I. \r  I can honestly not tell why, but I would like to tell my parents myself. There are no other grandchildren in our family, and I have been living away from home (like three continents away) for the last 12 years. So, in my mind, I really want to share this with my mom and dad and also have the same \u2018joyous family moment\u2019 like she did.  \r  My wife took it badly.\r  I think she feels excluded or that I do not want her to somehow be part of my family? Which on my part is absolutely not true. I just feel like I do not want this to be a joint announcement sort of situation. I want it to be intimate between me and my parents, and right after, we could all have a joint video call or whatever.  \r  She is very upset. I reminded her that we did not announce to *her* parents jointly. She is saying that I did not express any desire to do so (which is true, I did not even think of it) \u2026 but since she is clearly communicating *her* desire to me, it is different, and I should hear her. Sure, but I still want this to be my moment with my parents.  \r  When I say it out loud though, \u201cI want to announce our pregnancy to my parents without my wife\u201d it sounds wrong. Somehow it is like I have this righteous feeling of possessiveness over a piece of news/information. I am conflicted. \rAm I the Asshole?  \r  Note: she and my parents do not share a common language and communicate via translator app\r  ",

Now this Friday it was his week with the girls, he called me and asked if I could please take them earlier. When I asked him why, he told me that he needed to be with his wife at the hospital. I said no, that is not a reason to disobey the court order and that he either could stay with the girls, leave the girls with a babysitter or take them with him to the hospital. I hung up before he could continue. He texted me about two hours after telling me that I was extremely sick in the head and that for once, he was in a situation where he needed my help and I refused.

        "selftext": "My (26M) grandfather recently passed away after suffering from Alzheimer's for years. While it was sad, I knew he would be happier wherever he was going. During the planning of his funeral, my sister and I discussed who would attend, and she mentioned bringing her girlfriend.  I've always been openly supportive of my sister  (22F) and her relationship, but our family isn't. They haven't met her girlfriend and aren't wanting to, so I didn't think it was a good idea. When I told my sister that bringing her girlfriend to the funeral would cause drama, she got upset. She said she doesn't feel safe without her girlfriend there. I offered to stay with her during the entire service if she felt uncomfortable around certain family members, but she insisted on bringing her girlfriend. She said they are engaged, so her girlfriend is basically family whether others like it or not.  I told her it seemed like she just wanted drama and that if she felt she had to bring her girlfriend, she might as well not go because the funeral wasn't about her and her girlfriend but about our grandfather. My sister got very emotional, which made me feel bad, but I didn't think a funeral was the place to introduce her girlfriend to the family. My sister left and ended up not attending the funeral. It's been almost a week since the funeral, and I called my sister to check on her since we hadn't spoken much since our disagreement. She wanted to know about our grandfather\u2019s service, so I recapped everything. Then she started getting upset and saying she wished she could have been there. This made me angry because she could have been there, so I explained she chose not to attend because she wanted to bring someone to intentionally cause drama. This turned into another argument, and her girlfriend ended up taking her phone and hanging up on me, throwing in a jab about me being a bad brother. I feel like I could have handled the situation better, but I tried to offer countless solutions to my sister. AITA?",

        "selftext": "My Maid of Honor (29F) found out she's pregnant and due in August. I (29F) live a plane ride away from her. We've been friends for 15 years.  Today my MOH mentioned planning a baby shower in a group chat with me and our other friend, we can call him Ben (29M).  She asked Ben, who is local to her, How can I make sure you can attend the baby shower? He has a demanding job. I have a salary job and it's easy to get time off.  MOH shared she wanted to have her baby shower on a specific long weekend between my wedding (In April) and her due date. I said I'm so sorry, that's [other friend, let's call her Sue]'s wedding. MOH said woof, well I think that's the only weekend I can do it. Not only is it Sue's wedding but I was also planning on going to an event in the wedding's area with another friend, Daisy, who was planning to fly there for the event. I have no other plans the remaining weekends. I said I'd really hate to have to be an asshole and cancel on two people, I'd really appreciate if you did not put me in that position. Perhaps my wording was disrespectful there. My MOH shared that she did not understand why I have an issue cancelling on Daisy, but Sue's wedding she can understand. I explained that if it came down to it, I would cancel both of them for her baby shower, but it just sucks to be in this position.  She made several comments such as my baby shower doesn't revolve around your schedule and Yeah I get being upset about cancelling things, I have to cancel and change things for the next 18 years. I chose to ignore these comments as she has shared she is hormonal and wants people to go easy on her. I asked her to speak to her husband's family about their schedule and let me know to try to de-escalate. She said she didn't understand why I was getting upset at her and I didn't understand where she was coming from. Where she is coming from is that she is guessing this weekend is the only weekend her husband's family is available, and the weather around that time would likely be ideal. That's when I snapped a bit and pointed out that I was ignoring her rude comments and just wanted to work with her because I love her but she doesn't seem to see that effort and asked her to stop attacking me.  From there we did manage to de-escalate, but I still feel hurt that she was not willing to reconsider her plans for me, but had no problem asking Ben about how to make sure he can come. I also feel upset that she doesn't find it significant that I am being expected to cancel plans with multiple people that involve travel. Her opinion is I should have little problem cancelling these other things for her baby shower. I love her, I will, but it still fucking sucks. AITA for telling my MOH to stop attacking me after I told her it'd suck to cancel two large life plans for her baby shower. EDIT: This baby shower is NOT scheduled or confirmed with any of her family. She was throwing out a possible weekend and I shared I was busy. To clarify, if this date was SET and she told me \u201cthis is when it is, it is scheduled\u201d I would not have given her any grief at all.  EDIT2: some commenters have expressed opinion changes with this detail. We have the kind of friendship where I am 100% expected to attend this baby shower, which she considers a major life event. I am wondering if I am the asshole for not wanting to cancel on my other commitments or if she is the asshole for expecting me to cancel these and not being very willing to choose a date I am free, despite completely expecting my presence.  UPDATE: I spoke with my MOH today and we have resolved this conflict. We had a communication breakdown. She does expect me to be there but understands I have commitments. She chose another weekend.

For context last year he stole my credit card and spent upwards of 150$ on Call of Duty without my permission. Most recently he broke his TV in a fit of rage after being grounded and he took my car at night to hang out with his girlfriend. I can't take it anymore so I sent him to my older brother who is retired military. In hopes that he could straighten him out. This was two months ago, he calls me sometimes and begs me to come home saying life is like hell over there. He claims my brother works him to death and he has no freedom. I told him that he has to deal with the consequences of his action and to deal with it. Most recently he called my oldest son (18M) and begged him to come home. He asked me about it the other night and I told him not to or he'd be in big trouble. I came home from work a couple days ago and found both my sons in the living room. I was angry at my oldest and scolded him kicking both of them out and sending them to live with my brother. I got a call today from my oldest begging for forgiveness telling me the same thing his brother's been telling me for the past two months. I'm starting to feel bad because I don't want them living in total misery and that's what they make it sound like. I don't know exactly what he's doing to them and it's starting to concern me but I still don't want to let them back in and think they got off scot-free. Am I being TA here?? Update: In light of all the comments I have decided to go get them from my brothers house and bring them back home and figure out what is going on over there. Update 2: So I have the boys. At my brother\u2019s house we had a talk. I found out some interesting stuff. They first apologized for misbehaving. We spoke for a minute and then they got in the car. I asked my brother to tell me explicitly what happened. He told me light workouts and cleaning. When I got in the car and asked the boys. They told me it really wasn\u2019t that bad but they wouldn\u2019t want to go back for extended periods of time. They told me it was bad at first but all in all working out wasn\u2019t so bad once they started. They told me it wasn\u2019t really \u201chell\u201d just more than what they were used to. On the way back we had a talk about new rules and all *seems* to be well. I think we might at least be headed in the right direction for now.",

        "selftext": "I (44m) have two children (18m, 16f.) My ex-wife abandonded the family when my daughter was still a baby. I recently married a woman (42f) with three kids (17f, 14f, 13m.) Their father is still involved in their lives. All of our kids are still in high school, though my son is set to graduate soon. They recently had their spring break. During spring break my wife took her two girls to a major city near us for a Mommy/daughter day. They ate, went to a spa, etc. Before they went I suggested to her that she should include my daughter, but she said no as this was a yearly tradition with just her girls. While she was gone I took my kids and her son out for bowling and mini golf. After her trip with her girls was over, the next day, she took her son out for a Mother/son day where she took him out to see whatever movie he wanted. She and I have been arguing ever since about how she excluded my daughter from her Mommy/daughter day. I think it was cruel. My daughter grew up without a mother and I know it would have meant a lot to her to be included. But my wife says that she was just carrying on old traditions; of spending time with just her girls and then spending time with just her son, and that she'd be happy to start a new tradition with my daughter, but that it needed to be a different thing. She also said I didn't bring your son along with my mother/son time with my son. Why aren't you making an issue out of that? I told her that it was different; that my daughter really needed girl time and that excluding her was hurtful. I still think she should have invited my daughter along; that she should have been made a new part of the tradition. AITA? Edit: To be clear; I don't care about people voting that I'm the asshole.

        "selftext": "So basically, wife and I were in a rush to catch our subway train to go to a brunch with my parents at our favorite restaurant. We were already 10 minutes late, and my parents are always super punctual and I didn't want to keep them waiting any longer for us. As we approach the escalator down to our subway platform, I can hear our train approaching. So, I tell my wife that we need to catch the train, and we both hurry down the escalator, me in front of her. When we got to the bottom, I heard the subway door chimes, indicating that the doors were about to close. So, I rushed into the train at the last moment, but my wife was left on the platform of the other side. I thought, okay, well this sucks that I made the train but my wife didn't. But it's not really a big deal because we both know exactly where we are going, and it's only 5 stops away. I will just meet her at the restaurant. (I don't get any cell service underground, so we couldn't communicate with each other) So I arrive at the restaurant alone and greet my parents, who immediately question me about where my wife is. I told them what happened, and they didn't really seem to think much of it. But when she gets there 20 minutes later, she is all angry at me for not getting off the train at the next stop and waiting for her there, then getting on that train and continuing together. It made for a bit of an uncomfortable brunch, because we could all tell there was tension. After the brunch on our way home, she explained why she was mad and then became all short with me and pretty much gave me silence the rest of the way home. By the way, I making this subtle edit 25 days later after this was posted to let you all know that this entire story was completely fabricated. It's based on a real event that happened with my brother many years ago, but he was the one to get on the train and leave me behind. And he did wait for at the next stop when it happened. Thank you all for getting so worked up over something you read on the internet. Anyway, back to the story. My position is that we both knew where we were going and she knew my parents are easily irritated when I arrive late, so why would I have gotten off the train to wait for her unnecessarily? So AITA? Edit: Wow, so many people here just assuming New York is the only city in the world that has a subway... I've never even been to America lol. Edit 2: Yes, everyone, I am acutely aware that my judgement is I am an asshole. Thank you for all your contributions! I have apologized to my wife profusely and came home with flowers for her. Clearly even before writing this post, I apologized numerous times to her.... At the restaurant, on the way home, and hours afterwards. I'm usually a passive person and I don't like having conflict, so I literally apologize just to avoid conflict, even when I think I am correct (and I know in this case I am not). You can all make your judgements around my marriage and how I am undeserving, but you've read a few sentences on the internet to make that determination. Edit 3: Well, sorry to those of you rooting for my wife to divorce me. As much as you all probably think you know about me, my wife and my marriage by reading only a few sentences, we've resolved the matter and are laughing at all your comments together (well, it's more like she's laughing AT me).",

I have received so many messages making assumptions about what kind of a father I was and attacking me for not enabling a disrespectful adult. I hope you all enjoy handing out thousands of dollars every year to support the education of an adult who can't even bothered to give you the time of day after you've done everything for them. Thank you to the few mature and reasonable people who understand that I am not required to enable a disrespectful adult child. I've appreciated your public and private messages.** I want to start off by saying that I have done everything for my children. I was there at the hospital for their births, signed the birth certificates, I changed diapers and always provided them with food and designer clothes. But my ex is extremely manipulative and has tried to turn my children against me since day one. She manipulated my older daughter who refused to talk things out with me. I will still forgive her once she finally decides to snap out of my ex\u2019s manipulations and come back to me. Me and my younger daughter \u201cSarah\u201d had a great relationship until she suddenly flipped the switch in her senior year and also was poisoned against me. When \u201cSarah\u201d was applying for college I really didn\u2019t want her to go far because she has book smarts but lacks common sense and I didn\u2019t want her to fall for scams. I even offered to buy her a car if she lived with me and commuted to a local school. But Sarah just said that the local programs didn\u2019t have what she wanted. I found it insulting because I went to a local college and despite what my ex thinks, I am highly educated without some PhD. Sarah did not listen to my input at all. Her and my ex barely involved me in her college application process. My ex was extremely unhelpful. I would just ask basic questions like tuition since I was going to spend considerable funds, and she would either send website links. It would have only taken a few seconds for her to just answer the question so I can stay in the loop about what\u2019s going on. But this was just part of my ex\u2019s way of turning Sarah against me. Sarah enrolled at an out of state college and I didn\u2019t even find out until May because my ex didn\u2019t bother telling me. I didn\u2019t even get to see Sarah off at the airport since she didn\u2019t tell me she\u2019d left until after she was already gone. I constantly text Sarah asking how things are going. I send her funny posts on Facebook and ask her to call me. I even offered to split the cost of planefare so Sarah could visit over the holidays. She only responds on email and it\u2019s always her saying she\u2019s too busy. I am frustrated and tired of this. She is taking a lot of classes right now but I\u2019m her father and it would only take a second of her day to just text me back or talk to me on the phone for five minutes. I have supported and been providing for Sarah since day one. I am done being disrespected when I have bent over backwards for 18 years to give her everything and have sent $7,000 just this year for her schooling. I could be doing a million other things with that money. Maybe I am at fault for enabling it for so long but not anymore. I sent an email telling her that I am done with being disrespected and if she can\u2019t even give me the time of day then my ex can find someone else to split the cost of her schooling with. I sent the email over two hours ago and there\u2019s been no response. I know my wording might seem harsh but I am just so done with being disrespected. AITA?",

This school year, they've been making some really good grades (3.7+) and even juggling sports and/or clubs with that as well. I acknowledge that high school is difficult, between academics and social lives and athletics/hobbies.  Over spring break (Apr 1-5) my wife and i were planning to go on a 5-7 trip with our kids to Vegas because, well, we don't have anything else to do. I told my kids about it, and they seemed pretty happy for a getaway and a break.  On Saturday, my wife and I were looking at hotel bookings, and I brought up the idea of leaving on Good Friday (29th of March) and come back a week later on the fifth. I also added that they could probably stay home on Thursday just to relax as well. This is the part where my wife's face made the sound of a 1997 windows PC shutting down. She is very You go to school unless you're sick. She's not a mental health day person. The idea of missing school thursday and friday (our potential bookings we're about 6:00 a.m.) was a huge no-no.   She just began to ask me why they needed to skip that day, with my reasoning being mostly a) kids need a break and b) these same kids have missed only one day so far and also C) they're good kids, why not reward them? Even after a lot of talking, she still won't budge.  I've been thinking that maybe, I could have them take the one-day off anyways, but I'm asking here to see if I would be wrong before i do anything that could be seen as dum. AITA?

        "selftext": " Backstory: My boyfriend\u2019s grandpa passed away 4 days ago. When he passed we met all of his family at a small ER to say our goodbyes. The ER made everyone wear masks. Due to a sickness going around the hospital.  So 2 days ago I started to feel really bad body aches, sore throat etc. Keep in mind I\u2019m 18 weeks pregnant. I told him how I felt and he basically said he doesn\u2019t want to get sick because his grandpas funeral is coming up. I told him I was feeling weak as well as hungry and didn\u2019t want to drive myself home then be hungry once I got there. I asked him if he was okay with helping me for the night and I\u2019ll leave in the morning. Basically just bring me some food to the room so I wouldn\u2019t contaminate any other areas of the house. He told me he had a lot on his mind and wasn\u2019t in the right head space to help me. So I told him I understand and left.  When I got home I made something small to eat then went to sleep. Yesterday morning he calls and checks on me. I tell him how I feel more sick than when I left. He just says okay. The rest of the day he has family over until about 3am just offering their condolences and keeping his family company. Around 4pm I called and asked him for help to see if he could bring me something to eat because all I had the strength to get myself were just snacks like chips, cereal. No real meals and I wanted to make sure I had enough in me for the baby. He basically brushed me off saying he has no idea how he could help and said I was selfish for not thinking about him grieving and how he was stressed and had a million things on his mind. He also told me that I was being evil because I said he wasn\u2019t helping me at all. After that I just hung up. He called me at 3am when everyone left to sleep on the phone with me but hung up 20 mins later said he would call back but didn\u2019t. Now I don\u2019t want to speak to him at all. But don\u2019t want to cause him more stress when he\u2019s already sad about his grandpa.  I want to know if I\u2019m an AH for not respecting his time for grieving. Also would I be an AH for not talking to him today. I know how It feels to lose your grandpa when you\u2019re so close with him. But at the same time I just asked for a little bit of help and don\u2019t feel like I was asking him for a lot. Most medications you can\u2019t take during pregnancy because they have bad side effects for the fetus. So I\u2019ve just been waiting It out and he knows that as well.  Update: It\u2019s been decided I am the AH here and that is fine. But for the ones wondering about DoorDash and other options. I recently just paid my bills and I made groceries for his place since I would be there with him during this time. So unfortunately I cannot afford DoorDash at the moment but that would\u2019ve been my first option. I didn\u2019t bring any food with me because all of the groceries really have to be cooked besides snacks. Also I know he is grieving and would\u2019ve never said anything but if he was okay enough to do favors for others yesterday he could\u2019ve picked up some food and left It at my door step. Didn\u2019t even have to come inside. Also I have family and friends but getting them to do things for me is a bit of a challenge and I learned a while ago to stop asking. It\u2019s really just been me and him caring for one another. But after reading some of your comments I understand how I came off as needy. Thank You for your responses \ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffe\ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffe Edit: I speak to my family everyday we are close in that way. I see them every week as well. No bad blood between us. My friends don\u2019t live close to me to where it\u2019s easy to just drop off food and go. My parents on the other hand do. But now that I\u2019m an adult and since my other siblings have had children my parents tend to them. I have two siblings who aren\u2019t in their kids lives atm due to their own faults so my parents step in. When I ask for help where they have to physically do something since I was a kid It was always I\u2019m tired this or I do t feel like going here that. But when they ask me they feel like im just supposed to do whatever It is they ask. So yea I never call on them first. I call on my boyfriend we\u2019ve been together 3 years. ",

        "selftext": "Hello everyone, I'm coming on reddit to seek advice because I think I'm in the wrong. I 21F have 2 full siblings Michael, 23M and Damien 25M. We have a half sister Elsie 18F who is a result of an affair.  Our mother 50M is unfortunately terminally ill, the doctors have told us she doesn't have much time left. SHe called us all in to talk about her will and what we would each be getting. My mother was a banker and amassed quite the portfolio. Shortly after Elise was born, her mother wasn't very active in her life, leaving her to move in with us and live with us. I could always tell mom held some sort of resentment to her, my mom wasn't strong enough to leave after the affair and she regrets it everyday. Mom raised Elsie like her own for so long, but all Elsie could do was be snarky towards her and always say but you're not my real mom of course she'd only say that when mom was trying to discipline her. But as soon as she needed something expensive she'd be as sweet as sugar towards mom. I avoided elsie growing up because I always felt like she ruined our picture perfect family. Back to the day this happened, mom was reading out her will on her bed, my mother owns a beautiful emerald necklace; a family heirloom. She looks directly at Elsie and tells her she can keep it. I started crying immediately, it doesn't even make sense she's not entirely part of our family, her and mom share NO blood. I began to scream and yell at Elsie, I told her I wished she never walked into our lives, and that she should just leave because no one wanted her here. Damien tried to calm me down and reminded me we were in a hospital. Michael left the room with Elsie to avoid escalation. I saw mom crying and it kind of hurt but she hurt me worse. I grabbed my bag and left. It's been 3 days and I've gotten non stop messages from extending family saying I hurt my mom and she didn't mean any harm. AITA?  Minor Update: Hi all, I have received some very well worded and thought out comments/dms. Just to answer some questions, the heirloom comes from my mom's side not dads. My father passed 2 years ago. Elsie's mom is a deadbeat to put it nicely. My brothers rarely speak to Elsie mainly due to them living 3 states away. I will be talking to my mom asap, she wants to talk and I want too as well because at the end of the day I love her and would never change that. UPDATE: I visited mom and we had a really long talk about my life and growing up. I apologised to her and she accepted with a smile, she told me she'd always forgive me no matter what. That's why I love my mom she's a kind soul. I expressed to her that I felt I should have the necklace because we are blood and my grandma had it before, before her was my great grandma the x4. My mom started to tear up and explained that she thought I didn't want it and may as well pass it on to Elsie.  She said she knows Elsie isn't her real daughter, but over the years her resentment turned to pity cause she really didn't have anyone, especially after I moved out to live with my boyfriend. Mom said we could call Elsie and come to an agreement. Mom called elsie and she actually came over to the hospital instead. She sat with us and I asked her what her plans are with the necklace. She told me she was gonna take really good care of it and wear it.  I asked her if I could give her a portion of my current inheritance money as a way to buy it off her. E.g we both get $300,000 but I give her 25k, then she gets $325,0000 and I get $275,000 and the necklace. She said that was a good idea because I clearly have a connection to this necklace and she would benefit from liquid anyways.  Mom reassured her she would get other pieces of jewellery, my mom really loved bling. I feel happier knowing I could come to some sort of an agreement, but what's most important to me is that my mom and I are good and we are. I cried, told her I loved her and gave her a really big hug before I left. I said goodbye to Elsie and was on my way.  I called Damien and Michael when I got home to explain what had happened, they said they were proud of me for reaching an agreement everyone was happy with. We talked a little more of the course of 2 hours and we agreed that whilst we don't want Elsie actively in our lives, we were gonna make sure she was set and Michael said we should check in on her when we can.

Jo is one of my kids with my ex-wife, my ex has a job that has her traveling a lot so Jo stays with me the majority of the time. Within the last year maybe year 1/2 Jo has gotten bad acne. I  have gotten her multiple types of face wash and moisturizer. But her acne hasn\u2019t cleared up so I figured it was just part of her being part of a teenager. And maybe that she wasn\u2019t always washing her face and that\u2019s why it hasn\u2019t cleared up.  Well, recently Jo has been asking to go to a dermatologist because normal face wash and moisturizer don\u2019t work for her. I told her acne isn\u2019t that bad and she probably just needs to wash her face more often. Jo then told me she\u2019s self-conscious about her acne and that she would appreciate going to the dermatologist and just seeing if they could do something for her. So I asked her if she actually washes her face every day twice a day or does she only does it when she feels like it. She started crying and ran up to her room. Less than an hour later I got a call from my ex-wife calling me a huge asshole for accusing Jo of not washing her face and that\u2019s why she has acne and that it could be hormones keeping her skin from getting clear. And she said she\u2019ll make sure Jo gets to the dermatologist when she\u2019s back in town.  I didn\u2019t think I was the asshole but my ex-wife is pretty pissed and called me an AH multiple times so am I? ",

        "selftext": "Recently, I (21F) had my birthday and my boyfriend (21M)(of 3 years) took me out to dinner. After we had our meal he told me he had gotten a gift for me. Now usually, when he gets me gifts its never been too fancy, (e.g. last year he got me a pair of shoes I\u2019ve been wanting and some flowers. We\u2019re both only in our early 20s and in college so neither of us have a lot of money so I never expected too much in terms of gifts. So when I saw the box of a company I would never even dare to look at, I was extremely excited. But when he opened the box I saw a pair of gold earrings and my smile shrunk. I asked him why he would get me something gold if I only wear silver.He apologised but I was still a bit annoyed. And I realised he started becoming more frustrated on our way to his car. I could tell my reaction was bugging him and eventually he dropped me off at my apartment without coming inside and didn\u2019t even let me take the gift. I didn\u2019t want my night ruined so I had some of my girls over and so I wasn\u2019t really on my phone. The morning after my birthday I realised he had called me twice and sent me a message. To paraphrase, he basically said that he didn\u2019t realise it would be such a big deal and he never pays attention to my jewellery because he finds me beautiful with or without it - and guys just generally don\u2019t care about jewellery. I\u2019m pretty torn now because I think I may have overreacted and seemed ungrateful. On the other hand, we\u2019ve been dating for over 3 years and he doesn\u2019t even know what jewellery I like..",

        "selftext": "My (28F) sister \u201cBri\u201d 29F is getting married a year from now. Recently, she reached out to ask me to be a bridesmaid. I was surprised because Bri and I aren\u2019t super close, but I was happy to be a part of her special day. I used to be extremely overweight, and last year I decided to take control of my health and lost 75 pounds. I\u2019m much happier and healthier than I was, but I\u2019d still like to lose another 60. This became complicated when Bri sent us a link to the dress she wanted us to buy. I\u2019ve never been a bridesmaid, but apparently it is common for brides to ask their bridesmaids to buy their own dress. Still, the dress she requested costed $300, which seemed pricey to me. Bri has asked us to order the dress within a couple of weeks, as it\u2019s popular and she\u2019s worried it will sell out. I called Bri and told her I am on a weightloss journey and am not buying clothes, until I get closer to my goal weight unless they\u2019re from Goodwill or Walmart or something. Bri seemed really upset by this\u2013she asked if I could just purchase the size I am now and have it be loose at the wedding. I told her I plan on being almost 60 pounds lighter by the wedding, so the dress won\u2019t be loose\u2013it will literally fall off. Bri asked then if I could slow down my weight loss until after the wedding so the dress would fit. I told her absolutely not. I feel amazing and I\u2019m already losing at a slow and steady pace. I presented Bri with three solutions: 1\u2013I can wait to buy the dress until closer to the wedding, as I requested, 2\u2013she can buy me the dress now with her money, or 3\u2013I drop out of the bridal party, since she probably has people she\u2019s closer with than me anyway. Bri did not seem keen on any of these options\u2013even removing me from the bridal party. She told me I was ruining her big day and that it\u2019s about her, not me, so why does it matter if I wear a dress that\u2019s a little loose? I hung up after that to give Bri some time to cool off, but then I got a call from my mother telling me what a horrible sister I was and how selfish I was for not just ordering the bridesmaid\u2019s dress. She reiterated how it\u2019s Bri\u2019s day, not mine, and when I have my own wedding I can do things exactly how I want. To be truthful, I am finally starting to feel confident and to like how I look. Before I started losing weight, I wouldn\u2019t have cared if I wore a too-loose dress because I was \u201cfat and ugly\u201d anyway. Now, even though I only buy dirt-cheap clothes, I make sure to buy clothes that flatter me and accentuate my curves. I put a lot more effort into hair, makeup, and overall presentation. So yes, even though it is not my wedding, this will probably be the first formal event I go to after having lost weight, and I know lots of pictures will be taken. I want to look my best for these photos because I know I will look back on them and remember how hard I worked to get there. Does this make me a selfish AH?",

She has released 3 songs and has an album on the way and they are just\u2026 bad. She\u2019s got a horrible timbre, it\u2019s flat and whiny with weird modulation in pitch.

They\u2019re homeschooling the girl because she gets overwhelmed around big groups of people and because she goes to other programs and services during the day. All of this means she doesn\u2019t get many opportunities to be around other kids so my friend invited us and another family over and told us to bring our kids so her daughter could get used to being around other kids. Our kids are 12m, 10m, and 7f. The other kids were 11m and 8f.  She tried but the place wasn\u2019t set up very well for the kids. She had a little marble run set, magnatiles, board games, and coloring set up in the living room for the kids. Her daughter saw it and asked if those were her toys. My friend said no and that she got new ones for them to share with the other kids. Then she asked about the games and my friend said yes, those were their games. The girl picked up the boxes and took them to her room. My friend wasn\u2019t able to talk her into sharing them and refused to tell her they were for everybody.  The toys were also set up for younger kids so the boys started to get bored. I asked about turning on the tv and she told me that she can plug it in but she doesn\u2019t have cable or streaming so the only things they can watch are whatever\u2019s free on Roku or YouTube. We ended up sending the boys outside to play on her trampoline even though it was cold.  Her daughter only colored with the girls when her mom was with her, then after 20 minutes she wanted to play by herself and locked herself in her room.  She came out when dinner was ready and refused to sit with the other kids. There was pasta, chicken,  buttered noodles, and salad available but she still refused to eat any of it so her mom had to get up and make mac and cheese and dino nuggets just to get her to eat. After dinner she sat in her mom\u2019s lap and refused to move until we went home. She was thanking us while we were leaving and saying this was great for her daughter. I told her that watching her kid get special treatment and take things away from them wasn\u2019t good for the rest of the kids so she needs to wait until her daughter can be around people before she hosts again.  She thinks I was extremely rude and didn\u2019t need to say anything but someone needs to tell her that she can\u2019t have other kids over if that\u2019s how her kid behaves. AITA?",

My mom didn\u2019t want to talk to my brother all that much, she just wanted to meet her grandkids. Meeting her grandkids softened her attitude towards my brother. Soon, the entire family regained contact with him. My exSIL remained friends with my sister, and she freaked out when she heard about this. As a result, we only talked to my brother over the phone. The more I talked to my brother and his wife over the phone, the more I became friends with his wife. We would spend HOURS on the phone talking to each other about whatever random bullshit came to our minds. We made each other laugh. It was great. It was because of this friendship that I decided to finally invite my brother and my new friend to my house for my son\u2019s birthday party yesterday. It seemed like the perfect time to do so. What I didn\u2019t count on was my exSIL coming to the party. I had spoken to her a few days before and she said she wasn\u2019t sure if she was coming or not. Leading up to yesterday she hadn\u2019t said anything so I went ahead and invited my brother and his family. When my exSIL showed up, it was a shitshow. She yelled at my brother, who was just standing there in shock and when my exSIL realized who the woman next to my brother is, she let out \u201cstop looking at me you Jewish whore\u201d (my brother\u2019s wife is half-Jewish.)  I had tried to calm her down and talk to my exSIL, but at this point I yelled at her to get tf out of my house. She did, and we all just pretended this never happened. However, at the end of the party, my sister, who is still friends with my exSIL told me that I should have told my exSIL my brother and his wife were invited. It would have influenced her decision to come or not. Not doing say made me an ass. I explained that she didn\u2019t make it clear if she was coming, and that I only kicked her out after she made a blantanly racist comment. My sister was still pissed off about it, but she left soon after. AITA?",

        "selftext": "Me (42M) and my wife (41F) have been married 3 years. My wife has many good qualities, but she is quite disorganised and more than a little lazy. She \u2018loves\u2019 gardening but I think it's more that she likes the idea of gardening because she is terrible at it; she is the Saddam Hussein of plants. She not only has a poor idea of how to garden (what plants need what kind of care etc) but mostly because she is so lazy, her plants die from neglect. The amount of care needed to keep her plants alive is probably no more than 5-10 mins a day, but she can\u2019t even manage that.\u00a0 Her position is that it makes her happy and it doesn\u2019t really affect me so what do I care, and my position is that it's slightly psychopathic to claim to love plants but not put in even a very modest amount of effort to keep said plants alive. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me. Our compromise on this is that we just agree to disagree. I turn a blind eye to her wanton plant torture/murder so long as I don\u2019t have to participate, and she goes on happily throttling mother nature to death in the backyard. Our problem is that my wife is going on vacation for 3 weeks and now wants me to water her plants. I can do this very easily (so could anyone) but I have a moral objection: I don\u2019t want to be involved her cottage industry of death. To me, I\u2019ll be participating in keeping these tortured souls alive, maybe even giving them hope of a better life, only to have it dashed when she returns in 3 weeks to resume her reign of terror.\u00a0 My wife is claiming I\u2019m being dramatic (I am) but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m wrong, so we\u2019ve decided to ask reddit and will abide by the crowd\u2019s decision. AITA for not wanting to water her plants? EDIT: Ok wow this ended up getting way more polarizing than I thought. The consensus seems to be that I would be TA (or that I already am, and never loved my wife and deserve to die alone), so I will definitely look after the plants. I am hoping that like any good children\u2019s movie I can grow from being a grumpy curmudgeon to having a heart warming relationship with a row of cherry tomatoes. My wife, who has read through your replies notes that she is mortified at being outed as a Registered Plant Abuser, and will certainly try to do better. I myself have learned not to criticise her online because just as in real life, people like her a hell of a lot more than me, which she has been cackling about for the last hour. Thanks everyone!   EDIT 2: Guys I threw in the towel like 2 hours after I made this post. It's now 24 hours later. My wife has taken to randomly quoting posts from this thread that make me out to be the ACTUAL Saddam Hussein. Then she cackles. She's a cackler. There's like 600 comments calling me AH and somehow its not over. I've done the math, and I won't win another argument until 2057. Please, mercy. I WILL WATER THE PLANTS.",

        "selftext": "Here's the situation: My roommate, Dave, has been dating this girl, Lisa, for a few months. Lisa is an amazing cook, and whenever she comes over, she whips up these incredible meals. The thing is, she always makes way too much food, and they leave a ton of leftovers in the fridge. Now, Dave never eats the leftovers. I\u2019m not exaggerating when I say that every few days, I have to go through the fridge and clean out all the old food Lisa leaves behind because it just sits there until it starts to go bad. A few weeks ago, I decided to throw a small dinner party for some friends. I\u2019m not much of a cook, so I was getting stressed about what to serve. I thought, why not ask Lisa to help out? She\u2019s always cooking at our place anyway, and I\u2019ve always complimented her food. So, I casually mentioned it to Dave, asking if Lisa might be cool with cooking for my party. Dave seemed a bit taken aback but said he\u2019d ask her. The next day, he told me Lisa wasn\u2019t comfortable with it because she didn\u2019t want to feel like she was being taken advantage of. I was surprised but told him no problem, I\u2019d figure something else out. The night before the party, Lisa comes over and starts making dinner for her and Dave, as usual. I\u2019m in the kitchen, hanging out with them, and mention that I\u2019m still trying to figure out what to serve at my party the next day. Lisa doesn\u2019t say much but continues cooking, and I notice she\u2019s making a LOT of food \u2013 way more than just for her and Dave. After they finish eating, they leave the leftovers in the fridge. Given the history of these leftovers going uneaten and just taking up space until I have to clean them out, I get an idea. The next day, I take out the leftovers, heat them up, and serve them at my dinner party, along with a bean dip I made. My friends loved the food and kept complimenting me on how great it was. I just smiled and thanked them without giving too many details. That night, Dave comes home, orders pizza, and goes to bed without even checking the fridge. Two days later (after Lisa has already come and cooked another dinner), he notices the leftovers are gone and asks me what happened to them. I tell him I used them for my party. He gets super mad and says I had no right to take the food Lisa made. I argued that it was just leftovers, and since they never eat them, I figured it was better than letting them go to waste. Now, both Dave and Lisa are pretty pissed at me, saying it was a jerk move to steal her cooking for my party. I think they\u2019re overreacting because it was just food that was going to end up in the trash otherwise. So, AITA for serving my roommate's girlfriend\u2019s leftovers at my dinner party without asking?",

        "selftext": "My wife and I have a 2 year old daughter\u2014let\u2019s call her Anna\u2014and we\u2019re currently on a family vacation in Hawaii with my parents and my in-laws (7 people total). We are staying at my father\u2019s timeshare, which he periodically invites us to. The two pairs of grandparents adore Anna and seem to get along with each other. Anna is undergoing potty-training right now, and as with all potty-training, there are occasional accidents.  We arrived in Hawaii two days ago, and she had quite a few accidents - I suspect because she\u2019s dealing with an unfamiliar place and new people. Right before dinner, Anna had an accident on the pullout sofa, which necessitated a call to housekeeping to swap out sheets and cushions. My dad wasn\u2019t happy.  When all 7 of us sat down shortly afterward for dinner, my dad sat down and the first thing out of his mouth was, \u201cAnna is out of control, isn\u2019t she.\u201d Bear in mind Anna was sitting right across from him at the table. I let it slide and continued eating, and my wife said something to try to brush it off. Then, my dad suggested that we put Anna back in diapers and that she not be allowed on the bed or the couch. I responded by saying that I didn\u2019t want to do that and that potty-training is a process that has highs and lows. My dad then remarked that it would be problematic if she had an accident on the carpet because it\u2019d be hard to clean up. In my mind, I thought to myself, \u201cSo you don\u2019t want her on the bed, couch, or carpet\u2014where is she supposed to hang out the whole time, the bathroom??\u201d At that point, I was frustrated and said something to the extent of, \u201cIf Anna\u2019s accidents are too big of a problem, we can always find another place to stay at.\u201d That\u2019s when my dad blew up. He accused me of threatening him and of being disrespectful. It seemed that he took my suggestion as a threat of leaving, and he made very clear that he felt offended. He also said that I needed to \u201cbe careful with what I say and show respect to your parents.\u201d I responded by repeatedly telling him that I didn\u2019t threaten him nor intend for him to be threatened. He responded that \u201cit doesn\u2019t matter what your intent was, because I feel threatened.\u201d At this point I was really upset, so I said something I probably shouldn\u2019t have, remarking that he was \u201ctoo easily threatened.\u201d My dad then demanded that I apologize to him. I didn\u2019t feel that I had to, but I half-heartedly apologized because I wanted the argument to end and because it was making things super uncomfortable for my in-laws who were also sitting at the table and eating dinner through all of this. Later that evening my dad pulled me aside again and lectured me further about the argument. It seemed that the whole blowup happened in response to my remark that we could stay elsewhere if my dad couldn\u2019t tolerate Anna\u2019s potty training accidents. AITA for saying that? ",

        "selftext": "My friend (25F) asked me(24F) if I could watch her dog, Cody, for a two weeks while she went back to her home state to deal with some family issues. She told me he was potty-trained, good with people, and good with other animals (I have a cat, Tawny). I had been to her house a few times, and, at least during the times I've been there, he's usually a sweetheart. I said yes, and when it came time for her to leave, she dropped Cody and his things off. First thing I realized is that Cody wasn't as house trained as she claimed. Maybe he knew it was wrong to pee in *his* house, but he clearly thought it would be perfectly okay to do it in mine. It happened on the first day, and when I told her, she said she had let him outside rather than walking him like she usually would, so maybe he had just sat outside and did nothing rather than do his business. It had been on the vinyl wood floor and I caught it immediately, so I just let it slide, cleaned it up, and took him for a walk right after. But as the days went by and it happened more than once, it became clear to me that he just wasn't that well potty trained at all. Second thing I realized is that, yes, he's friendly with other animals, but that doesn't mean good with other animals. Tawny had no problem with him when he was calm, but when he was hyperactive and getting all up in her space, she would get hissy and swipe at him. I ended up banishing him from the upstairs. But that led to another problem: Cody hated to be alone at night. He absolutely hated it, and made sure everyone knew about it by whining and barking until he would tire himself out. I finally ended up calling my friend and telling her that her dog isn't as well-behaved as she claimed, and that she needed to tell me another friend of her's she felt comfortable enough to hand him off to or that I was just going to end up sticking him in a doggy daycare that she'd either have to pay for or pay me back for. She got upset and asked why I had agreed to dog sit if I was just going to dump him, but I agreed to dog sit a dog who was painted as not having behavioral issues. She couldn't find someone she could trust to take care of Cody, so I found a non-expensive but still decently reviewed doggy daycare to drop him off at. She said she'd pay me back since I ended up paying up front, but that she was really cross with me and wasn't sure if she could depend on me for things anymore. I felt totally justified originally, but the more I thought about it, the more I realized I could totally understand why she'd be upset that I essentially went back on my word and also made her pay for a service she hadn't planned on using (I hadn't asked her to pay me to watch her dog). AITA? Extra Info based on things I'm seeing commonly asked about and brought up:  1. I know how to care for a dog. Before I moved out of my parent's house, I was the main caretaker for the family dog, Prince. One of the reasons I was convinced she hadn't trained Cody as well as she claimed was because Prince never had accidents no matter where he was once I had him potty-trained. He understood that if he's inside, he shouldn't do it. 2. The daycare wasn't something I just chose on my own haphazardly. I looked through the places near me and she agreed on one for me to take him to according to reviews and pricing. 3. I followed the instructions of Cody's care given to me. 4 walks a day with 4 hour intervals starting at 8 with a last call to the backyard before bed. As for attention, I\u00a0*like*\u00a0to think I gave him plenty. I played with him indoors and outdoors and he'd sit with me on the couch during downtime. He didn't really beg for attention during the daytime, and he didn't beg for attention during night until he got permabanned.4. I wouldn't say Tawny is socialized with dogs per say, but Cody isn't the first dog she's been around. She's been around Prince, but we had him trained not to rush at people or jump at people and that translated to other animals as well by default, so she never had a problem with him. When my friend had told me good with people and other animals, I had assumed that meant he probably had similar training.  Honestly, based on the mixed answers so far, I'll probably end up just splitting the costs with her. It seems both of us didn't think this through during her rush to leave. I had a standard for what I considered a trained dog to be based off of Prince without considering that not every dog is going to be like Prince, and she didn't think about how Cody might be in a new environment he's never been before and assumed he'd behave as well as he did at home. A lot of assumptions had been made on our ends that made sense in a vacuum, but not when put into practice. ",

Austin has a girlfriend, Bridget, whom he\u2019s been dating for nearly a year. Early in their relationship, Bridget stayed over once while Donna was at school. With Donna\u2019s blessing, Bridget slept in Donna\u2019s room, and Austin stayed in his own. They chose to sleep separately, and there was no drama. This winter break, both kids were home. Toward the end of break, Bridget returned from out of state but couldn\u2019t move back into her dorm yet. Austin asked if she could stay with us for a few days. I agreed but mentioned we\u2019d need to figure out sleeping arrangements since we don\u2019t have a guest room\u2014just mine and my husband\u2019s room, Austin\u2019s, and Donna\u2019s. Austin said he and Bridget now share a bed, but his twin bed would be a tight fit. Donna has a full-sized bed, so I suggested Donna and Austin switch rooms temporarily. Donna could use Austin\u2019s bed, and Austin and Bridget would stay in hers. I assured Donna I\u2019d change the bedding afterward, but she was visibly upset and asked why Austin couldn\u2019t just sleep on the couch. I told her it was only for a few days, and since Austin wanted to share a bed with Bridget, this arrangement made sense. When Bridget arrived, everything seemed fine at first. That night, Bridget went to bed early, and Donna pulled Austin aside in the kitchen. I couldn\u2019t hear the start of their conversation, but Austin suddenly started yelling, \u201cShut up! Why would you say that?\u201d before storming into the living room. He loudly announced he\u2019d never invite Bridget back if \u201ceverything\u2019s such a problem.\u201d When I asked what happened, Austin explained that Donna asked him not to have sex with Bridget in her bed. He claimed he had no intention of doing that and accused Donna of being weird and trying to cause trouble. Donna said she had purposely tried to talk to Austin quietly to avoid a scene and hadn\u2019t said anything to Bridget. She also said it wasn\u2019t unreasonable to ask, given she knew Austin and Bridget were sexually active. I told Donna she didn\u2019t need to make such a big deal since I\u2019d already promised to wash the sheets. Donna became upset and ended up staying with a friend for the rest of break. School has since resumed, but Donna is barely responding to my calls or texts. Austin told me Bridget overheard the argument and now feels uncomfortable being in our house or around Donna. My husband said Austin caused the scene by yelling and pointed out that Donna wasn\u2019t out of line for making her request. He also said I should never have let Bridget stay in the first place.AITA? ",

Won\u2019t get into details, but it was the classical \u201cwent in with a paper cut, got out with AIDSCancer2000\u201d situation. I\u2019ve got roughly a year and a half left. Over time, I\u2019ve made a bunch of unwise decisions. I have multiple children with different women. I have three sons: Lance (43m) who has two daughters, Mark (22m) and Tony (15m). And four daughters: Cammy (38f) who has four children, Linda (30f), Ronny (28f) and Kathie (24f). Not going to lie here, I\u2019ll just say that I was only involved in raising Ronny and Kathie. Their mom died when they were little and I couldn\u2019t refuse to take them in. Ronny is starting her career in law and Kathie recently got her degree in agriculture. 9 years ago I also took in Mark, who was kicked out by his shitty stepdad. Mark decided against pursuing higher education. I own a ranch. It\u2019s not a little one, though, but we\u2019re managing just fine with the help of hired staff. We have about 500 heads of cattle, not counting the horses. The ranch has been in my family for generations. I know for certain that the only children who would be interested in preserving the ranch are Kathie and Mark. Maybe it\u2019s just my delusion grandeur, but I\u2019m very passionate about passing the ranch down to my children, so they\u2019ll be able to continue the family tradition. Knowing my children and knowing that they probably inherited my \u201camazing\u201d personality, I can say for sure that the second I draw my last breath, there will be an inheritance war vicious enough to make Middle East and Eastern Europe seem like a recess fight in kindergarten. It will be nasty, painful and disgusting. I wrote a will. As per my will, the ranch will go to Kathie and Mark 50:50. Including all the machines, trucks, other equipment, financial assets. Ronny, the executor of the will, is getting my 1970s Lincoln Continental. She\u2019s the one who\u2019s driving this car for the last 5 years and she\u2019s the one paying for maintenance, insurance, everything. The other children get $10k each and Tony gets my car, a 2010s Chevy Suburban, purely because it\u2019s a safe car and he\u2019s getting his license this year. The grandkids also get $5k each. It\u2019s not much, but I don\u2019t own much either. I\u2019ve notified my children that I don\u2019t have much time left. Of course they asked to see the will. I know that the second they see it, the shit will hit the fan and things will escalate. I don\u2019t want it. I don\u2019t want to spend my final year seeing my children suffer and fight. Ronnie advised me agains disclosing the will, she\u2019s a skilled lawyer so I trust her completely. I refused to disclose the will and now my children are enraged. They keep speculating about the will, they keep pestering me and giving advice on what should I leave to whom. Am I the asshole for refusing to disclose the contents of my will? By now, the only ones who know about them are me and Ronnie and I intend to keep it this way.",

About seven months ago, I rented to a couple in their mid-forties. She\u2019s a substitute teacher out all day, and he\u2019s \u201cretired\u201d and home during the day.Generally, they\u2019re great tenants\u2014rent is always on time, and they\u2019re easy to live with. However, she\u2019s a shopaholic, constantly ordering packages. I don\u2019t mind occasional deliveries, but the sheer volume has become overwhelming.I frequently order from Amazon and other sites.  I have deliveries sent to my garage and notifications set up.  I also work from home so I can retrieve packages quickly if drivers miss instructions. So far, no issues and I\u2019ve never had any porch pirates.When the tenants moved in, they went on an extended overseas vacation, saying they\u2019d have \u201ca few packages\u201d shipped back. I agreed, but soon became inundated with over 20 large boxes, some weighing 30-40 pounds. I schlepped them to my garage until they returned. I brushed it off, thinking it was a one-time thing. Then they went on a two-week cruise, and more packages arrived.Since then, deliveries haven\u2019t slowed down. I asked them to set up delivery instructions to the garage and notifications, the same as I did. I made it clear that I don\u2019t want my porch to become a target for thieves, especially since my house faces the main road. Despite this, packages were still left on my porch.Again, I spoke to her, and suggested she rent a mailbox at a nearby postal store, but she said it was too expensive and inconvenient with her schedule. Amazon Lockers don\u2019t work since she orders from other sites. She did agree to have packages sent to her sister\u2019s during vacations, but this doesn\u2019t address the daily issue.Packages keep coming to my porch, so I must move them to the garage and text them each time, sometimes 3 or 4 times a day. It\u2019s become a huge PITA, as I have a ruptured disk in my back, which she is aware. I've nearly tripped over boxes just opening the door to leave the house. Two weeks ago, there were two huge boxes taking up my whole porch.  I swear, I\u2019ve had to fight the urge to NOT punt the damn things off the porch and I don\u2019t want to bust my foot LOL.I\u2019m usually easygoing, but I\u2019m fed up with being the \u201cmiddle man\u201d for her \u201cshopping sprees,\u201d as she jokes and I feel it is very inconsiderate. I don\u2019t want to seem like a nitpicky, b*tch, especially since I already had to address parking issues when they first moved in.I made it clear when I interviewed them that we\u2019d need to respect each other\u2019s space due to our unique shared living circumstances, yet they seem oblivious.They\u2019re on a month-to-month lease, and I\u2019m considering raising the rent for the extra hassle or banning deliveries entirely.AITA, or is my tenant being inconsiderate and rude?",

        "selftext": "A little about me: I am 30, and my wife is 29. Before we got married (we knew each other for three years), we decided I would be the sole earner, responsible for finances and taxes, while she would be a housewife, taking care of the kids and household duties. We agreed she would never work, and I wouldn't ask her to either. In the first two years of our marriage, we didn't have kids. I worked from 8 am-6 pm. Sometimes she'd wake up and make me breakfast, sometimes she wouldn't. I didn't mind because we were early in our marriage. On days she made breakfast, she would also pack me lunch. On days she didn\u2019t wake up early, I would eat both breakfast and lunch at work. She would wake up around 12-2 pm, do household chores, and wait for me to come home. We would have dinner together and spend time going out for movies, dinners, or visiting friends, at least twice a week. This year, we had a baby. I took one month of leave to help her, which is the maximum my job allows. State leave was an option, because the subsidized pay wouldn't cover our bills. After my leave, her parents stayed with us for two months, helping with the baby. I supported all the household bills during this time. After they left, our baby was three months old, and this is when issues began. My wife was used to her previous routine of waking up late and now found it difficult to manage caring for the baby and household chores. I offered to help by cleaning the first floor of our house and putting our baby to bed several times a week, despite working from 8 am to 6 pm, handling all immigration paperwork, taxes, bills, and grocery shopping (since she doesn\u2019t drive). However, every day I come home, she seems angry or upset, often taking it out on me. Sometimes it's about the baby, sometimes it's about me not helping enough around the house. Today, we had an argument where I asked why she was consistently struggling with her responsibilities. I acknowledged that she had an easier life in the first two years of our marriage because she didn\u2019t work, but reminded her that we had planned for this baby and understood it would require more work. We had agreed she would be the primary caretaker and housewife, but now, she would not stop complaining and we can't stop having fights. Am I the asshole for asking her to fulfill her share of the household responsibilities?",

        "selftext": "My gf is currently pregnant with our first child, which we recently learned was a boy. Before we knew the gender we made a deal that if it was a girl, I would choose name and if it was a boy she would pick. That was before I realized that I hated every single name on her list. Especially the two that she was leaning toward the most, Elyan and Gawaine after the knights of the round table. One thing about her is that she has always been into fantasy and mythology, especially the Arthurian legends and she expressed that she has always loved both of these names. Even though I didn't like her choices, I figure we didn't even know the gender yet so there was no point it bringing it up. Unfortunately, it turned out to be a boy (Not because I didn't want a boy, but because I didn't want to have this conversation). I was hoping that she would change her mind and pick a better name, but no. She decided on Elyan, which I guess is better than Gawaine. But I still hate it. It sounds like a douchebag in a teen movie that they were trying way too hard to give a unique name. I asked her if she had any normal names that we would both be happy with. She asked me what was wrong with the name she chose and I brought up the above mentioned concern. She got upset and told me that we had an agreement and she would have accepted any name I chose, even though she didn't like any of them either. Now she'll barely talk to me. I've apologized for being so harsh about it, but I would at least like a say in the matter. I even mentioned another name that was on her list that I didn't hate as much (Leon) but she won't budge. I honestly don't think it's unreasonable for me to want to have a say in my own sons name, but everyone I've talked to said that they actually really like the name an it's not fair for me to go back on our deal. So AITA? Edit: Okay, yes making that deal was stupid and we shouldn't have done it in the first place. And yes, asking her to pick a normal name was a shit thing to say. I'm going to sit down and have an actual conversation with her about it and see if we can come to some kind of an agreement. And for those asking, it's pronounced Ellie-ahn (but sometimes when she says it, it comes out Elli-un.",

        "selftext": "Sorry this title sounds so dramatic, in reality it\u2019s more just complicated.\r  \r  So I (32/F) was adopted as a baby. It was supposed to be a closed adoption, but my biological parents\u2019 names were visible on the paperwork that came from the hospital/adoption agency. I was able to track down my bio-mom about 10 years ago. We exchanged a few emails and talked on the phone, and she sent me photos of my bio-siblings who were not placed for adoption. I expressed interest in meeting my bio-siblings and my bio-mom said she was sure they\u2019d like to meet me also, but she needed time to break the news of my existence to them because she felt some type of way about having kept it a secret for 20+ years.\r  \r  As I said, that was 10 years ago. Bio-mom never reached out again to let me know she\u2019d told the rest of the family about me, nor did I hear from any of them, so I assume my existence is still a secret. And when I did try sending her an email (about something unrelated, it was actually a medical history question) at one point after that, I never got a response. So my read is that she\u2019s not interested in further contact with me, which is understandable and more than fine.\r  \r  But on the other side of the coin, I was never able to find my bio-dad although I did try for a while. I\u2019ve recently been considering submitting my DNA to 23 & Me on the chance that maybe I can find him or family members on his side, and also I\u2019d just like to know more about my ethnicity and heritage. But I know that if I do so and anyone on my bio-mom\u2019s side has submitted DNA or does in the future, they\u2019ll see that I exist. \r  \r  I\u2019ve respected my bio-mom\u2019s wishes not to reach out directly to my bio-siblings even though I have their contact information, and I can\u2019t shake the feeling that doing 23 & Me is just a sneaky way of circumventing that and acting all innocent. It feels kind of crappy and like it would be a betrayal. I considered trying to send my bio-mom a heads up that I was planning to submit my DNA, but since our interaction ended with her ghosting me I worry that sounds like a threat or an ultimatum. \r  \r  So WIBTA if I submitted to 23 & me, and/or should I try to warn my bio-mom first?\r  ",

My wife asked if I had seen my daughter's boyfriends list as 'we need to buy him something'. Maybe it's just me, but growing up, my parents didn't give two craps about who I was dating. Much less, have any intention of adding them to a present list. I asked a few friends and everyone was a resounding NO about this practice. My wife insists this is very normal and is calling me the AH for not want to comply.

        "selftext": "My husband (30M) and I (28F) are pregnant and thinking of baby names for our son due later this year. We\u2019ve got a good list of names we love, but we\u2019re still undecided. The other night I was up late with a bought of insomnia, thinking about when our baby is going to be a kid and what he\u2019ll be like, and I remembered my childhood best friend, Lucas.  We were best friends from 5 until 15, when he passed away. About a month before he died, we started \u201cdating\u201d, as in we held hands in the hall at school and kissed a handful of times. My husband knows about him as I have fond memories with him and he\u2019s in a lot of my childhood photos. He has never shown any disdain to me talking about Lucas. I also do not harbor any leftover romantic feelings for Lucas. I loved him, but we were not in love, just kids doing what kids do. He was my best friend and I miss him, but he is dead. Lucas is a pretty timeless name with multiple variations, as well as a way to honor my childhood best friend, especially since he doesn\u2019t have any siblings who could name their children after him. Plus, a lot of my and my husbands first name ideas have multiple syllables, so I thought a short middle name like Luke would help balance it out.  I suggested it and my husband hit the roof. He said me wanting to name our baby after an ex-boyfriend was gross and insulting to him as the father. He said if the baby should be named after anyone, it should be him. I told him I wasn\u2019t trying to be insulting and it was just an idea, not a name I was set on and him vetoing it was completely fine. I also said it wasn\u2019t naming our baby after an ex, but an old friend. He\u2019s still angry, though, and is demanding I apologize for disrespecting him as the father.  I refused to apologize because the suggestion wasn\u2019t a way to disrespect him. It had nothing to do with him at all, it was just a way to pay homage to my friend. He said he\u2019s not interested in brainstorming ideas anymore and has been giving me the cold shoulder ever since. AITA?  ETA: I will be apologizing to my husband, a lot of people pointed out that whether I meant to offend him or not, his feelings were hurt and I do want to try and remedy that. I\u2019m also going to try and have a conversation about how he feels about Lucas moving forward.  I now see a lot of people are getting caught by the ex part, as my husband is. I assumed it was clear that I do not still have feelings for Lucas. I do not wish I was having a baby with him instead. He was not a childhood crush. As an adult, I know that we were pairing off because that\u2019s what everyone else our age was doing and he was my very best friend, so why not? When he died, I mourned the death of a friend, not an ex lover.  I am also not trying to force this name on our baby. It was merely a suggestion because I thought it was sweet and it fit what we were looking for in names. If my husband says no, it\u2019s a no. I don\u2019t know why people thought I would do otherwise. ",

        "selftext": "I have a 13 year old daughter (almost 14) who is in 8th grade. School let us know about the graduation trip which she really wants to go to but we have been dealing with some behavioral issues. I told her she needs to behave before I would sign her up. A few days went by and I told her it wasn\u2019t enough time yet. I needed to see more. She was afraid the trip would be filled up and she would be too late. So I agreed to sign her up for the time being but I told her I would withdraw her if more issues arise. She agreed. The type of issues we had up until this point was: 1. She was failing on her chores on a daily basis. (Her chore list is very short. The only daily item is keeping her room clean. Then the weekly item of taking the trash out.)2. She was secretly texting an ex-boyfriend. Who didn\u2019t treat her well. 3. When she was caught, she tried to get her younger sister to lie and cover for her. 4. Her younger sister who came clean told me I needed to protect her because she was scared how her older sister was going to \u201cpunish\u201d her. After I signed her up, I told her that she needed to do everything as we say. We are not strict parents so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable. School\u2019s Thanksgiving dinner rolls around. We all went. As soon as she got her food, she tried to leave the table to go hang out with a friend (female). Her dad (my ex) told her to stay for at least a little while. She never asked me or my husband for permission to leave. Soon after she left and I thought it would just be a brief moment. An hour went by and she\u2019s not answering our texts or calls. My husband and I spent the next 40 minutes looking for her. Couldn\u2019t find her. Finally she answered a call from my ex. She was outside apparently, still with the same friend. That\u2019s when I decided we are taking her out of the trip. She is distraught. AITA here?  UPDATE: Due to the overwhelming amount of people that voted me the AH, I have reinstated her trip. We can see a noticeable change in her behavior right after. Prior to reinstating her trip, she was sad, yes, but she finally started cleaning her room every day (which as I stated in the comments, only meant cleaning up after herself, and pulling up the blanket on the bed in the morning. Just a few minutes a day is all it takes.) and she took the trash out without any arguments. The last few days since we've reinstated her trip, she's no longer cleaning her room and gave me such an attitude last night to take the trash cans out. I guess this makes me a better parent now?  ANOTHER UPDATE: So after I've mentioned that the trip is back on and her behavior is worse than ever before (she's still a great kid by the way!), I've gotten more comments and DMs letting me know I'm a bigger asshole now and somehow a worse parent. It seems this trip thing is quite a soft spot for many of you, expressing your own personal stories of your relationship with your parents etc. I know this is reddit and you have no way of knowing the whole picture of my relationship with my children, and at this point, whatever I say, many of you will read it as defending myself (which many have said is Red flags or attitude etc.) but honestly, it sounds like instead of telling me to get therapy, many of you REALLY need therapy. If you are still holding on to some mistreatments from your parents, you need therapy more than me. I was abused, emotionally and physically, growing up. I let all that baggage go and I try hard not to make the same mistakes. Many of you have not. Also, if you are telling me how terrible your children are than mine, then perhaps you don't need to give me parental advice. For all of you who said in so many years, my kids won't talk to me any more, please remind me to give you an update then! I'm sorry for all of you that are struggling with raising kids or struggling with your relationship with your parents. That is hard. I know I'm the last person you want advice from but I do have a wonderful relationship with my kids (most of you won't believe it any way I guess). My kids tell me stuff - not everything I'm sure, I'm not that naiive. But I do know about all of the boys they've dated. We try to have weekly dates with our kids - my husband and I each take one child, or we have open talk times so we can have an open communication. They do not feel smothered and understand that actions have consequences. They also see first hand what happens to kids with parents that have no rules vs the ones that do. We also take many many family trips together every year and the kids often even cook with me (their choice). I'm not a strict parent and I stand by that. I can't imagine any strict parent would let their children date at 12/13 years of age.  Thank you to the people who mentioned that she didn't see leaving the table as doing anything wrong. That comment resonated with me the most and was the main reason why I created this post. I suspected that was the case and why I wanted a second opinion and why I ultimately reinstated her trip. ",

I understand that it's her wedding day and she wants things a specific way, but I don't understand why I can't wear my makeup. My dad says it how she wants it to be for the pictures and such, and that it's a 'respect' thing. I should mention that they are very accepting of how I dress/present. Which is why I was confused when he said that she didn't want me to wear my makeup.I'm not trying to get attention - that's not my intention. I feel comfortable with how I dress and feel 'at home' with my makeup. So I sort of feel like they're restricting that for some pictures at the wedding. But I could be wrong, AITA? EDIT: I realize that I am the asshole. I was a bit self centered with what I wanted, but I talked with my step-mom and she said no white foundation and we could find a look that we both like that I could do. It's not my day. And there's a time and place for things. Thank you for your guys input :)",

        "selftext": "Before we go into the situation, I (33M) own my own company, but the job requires me to be away from home for weeks at a time. When I am home it\u2019s usually only for 4-5 days before leaving for work again. My wife (30F) is a SAHM who is often overstimulated and who just recently started her own small business. Now on with the situation. So my wife text me this evening saying I may want call my daughter tomorrow and talk to her, because she\u2019s had a rough day. According to her my daughter was tired our two boys were fighting and this caused my daughter to become upset and start crying for me. My wife being overstimulated didn\u2019t let her call me so she could talk to me.  When I asked why my daughter wasn\u2019t able to call me my wife responded with \u201cI was overstimulated and just wanted them to go to sleep.\u201d  When I read the word \u201coverstimulated\u201d I called her.  My wife\u2019s love language is affirmation and I\u2019ve learned that calling and giving her words of affirmation helps her calm down. We talk for several minutes with me telling her how great of a job she\u2019s doing with the kids and with sales at her business. Because honestly she has been doing great with keeping the business up and holding down the home front. Then she asked, \u201care you mad that I didn\u2019t let her call you?\u201d I said \u201cno but it does upset me when I find out one of my children was literally verbally crying for me but wasn\u2019t allowed to call me.\u201d This caused her to blow up on me saying I don\u2019t know what she goes through on a daily basis because I\u2019m always gone for work and that she feels like I don\u2019t respect her feelings as much as I do our children\u2019s feelings. So I brought up that this wasn\u2019t the first time she\u2019s done this and asked her how it would make her feel if one of the kids were crying for her but weren\u2019t allowed to call her. She again said I wasn\u2019t considering her feelings. So I asked her why she doesn\u2019t let them call me if they\u2019ve been \u201cbad\u201d. And she replied \u201cI\u2019m hanging up now. I don\u2019t appreciated being told I gate keep my kids phone time with their dad as a form of punishment or that your not respecting that I didn\u2019t let her call because I was overstimulated. Call her in the morning.\u201d And she hung up. I never once downplayed the fact she was overstimulated. I just pointed out that I don\u2019t want my kids to EVER feel like they can\u2019t call me, when they need me to talk to them after a bad day, because it might cause someone else to be upset. So AITA? TL;DR my wife didn\u2019t let my daughter call me when my daughter was upset and is now mad that I implied she gate keeps their phone time with when she\u2019s overstimulated or trying to punish them. Edit: I call my wife and kids every morning and FaceTime them for about two hours each night.",

        "selftext": "For context me (M29) and my wife(F28) have been married for the past 4 yrs and have been blessed with two sons. Recently my wife has been complaining about the difficulty of her job more and the amount of work she has to put in following a workday. I work about 50-60 hrs a week whereas she works 40hrs a week and I have tried to increase the amount of home work I do over the weekends lately. The problem for me lies in the fact that we take both kids to daycare which costs a pretty big chunk of our budget and is more or less 70-80% of her income per month. I make enough for all of us to be more or less in the same financial situation with a few more overtime hours a week if she quit her job. And since she has been complaining recently when she started venting yesterday I told her she might as well quit and just take care of the boys, and id bump up a few hrs since it's pretty much the same type of work (she works in social care). According to her I'm minimising her work and just not focusing on the real problem. I've tried to talk with her about why she doesn't want to just quit if she keeps whining about the job in the first place, but haven't had much success today. AITA? Edit: It's my fault for not including this but a lot of people are assuming this is day to day venting, it isn't. She wants to pursue a career in her degree(digital marketing) and sees no future in social care which is why I asked her why not just quit.",

Not because I thought the education was better but they follow an international curriculum based on the UK system and this is helpful for applying to international universities who recognize the system. My son will be studying engineering abroad. At the time when my son changed schools my daughter said she was happy not to switch schools and said it would be hard to make new friends etc. However now since he started attending she has gotten jealous and started reading his textbooks especially the science ones and going through things like the yearbook. She is now upset with me because I refused to switch her to the school even though she herself at the time said she was happy where she was. While I can afford it, the education isn't really better and I only sent my son there so that foreign universities recognize the credential better. Furthermore the school environment would be quite different. She goes to a girls only school and this is co-ed and most of the girls at the school are foreigners with different values and usually the kids of diplomats and embassy workers and the boys are either the kids of diplomats or the ultra rich locals and I am concerned this could cause her to either not fit in or lose her morals.

        "selftext": "I\u2019m lucky enough to be engaged to the woman of my dreams. She\u2019s perfect in every way and the wedding is currently scheduled for next June. Right now along with my fianc\u00e9e, I have a very close friend living with us. She was my roommate in college and basically family. 5 months ago, she found out she was pregnant when she was told her entire life it was impossible for her to have kids. She was ecstatic but her boyfriend (in case it comes up he was also my roommate and basically family) wasn\u2019t and begged her to have an abortion. Basically she thought she\u2019d never have another chance but they were absolutely not in any position to raise a kid at the moment. Their relationship got very strained and she ended up having a miscarriage. 1 week after, she found out her boyfriend was having an emotional affair with a coworker. They broke up and she ended up also getting into a massive fight with her family. Obviously I moved her into my place asap and while she was definitely struggling for a while I\u2019m glad to say she seems to be slowly healing.  A few nights ago my fianc\u00e9e had some of her friends over, all of which are bridesmaids. My friend joined them and all of them ended up getting pretty drunk. My fianc\u00e9e falls asleep pretty fast when she\u2019s drunk so I carried her up to our room and tucked her in so I could take care of everyone else. My friend at that point had started drinking really heavily and looked kind of sick so I walked her up to her bathroom and held her hair for about 20 minutes while she puked. When I figured she had enough out of her system I left her to go check on the other girls and get them home. I was walking down the steps and heard one of her friends make a comment about me helping my friend up \u201cbecause I wanted to get in her pants\u201d. The other girls around her immediately told her off (they\u2019re all aware of my friends situation btw) and I just stood obstructed on the stairway trembling in anger. I managed to calm down temporarily, come down and send them all home in Ubers (I had offered to drive them before but in all honesty I felt so angry I did not want to be in that position. 3 days later and I\u2019m still angry. I genuinely don\u2019t ever want to be in the same room as this woman ever again let alone have her 8 feet away as I say my vows. I haven\u2019t told my fianc\u00e9e any of this yet, but I was planning to do so tomorrow as well as request her friend atleast be removed from having a role if not flat out be uninvited to the wedding.  So would I be the asshole for asking to remove her for something she said when she was drunk Edit: quite a few comments on this now I want to address a few points 1. First, my fianc\u00e9e and her friends do not \u201chave problems with alcohol\u201d. My girl is a light weight and none of her friends were blackout drunk or anything that far. The only person who puked was my friend. Passing out because you drank too much and falling asleep after having a couple drinks are too entirely different things. Ok I really gotta spell it out here because this is getting fucking ridiculous. Every girl not living in my house had 3-4 drinks that night. Enough that none of them were getting behind the wheel but not enough that they were all massively hammered and completely out of control. My fianc\u00e9e had maybe 3 drinks and fell asleep 30 minutes after. Not passed out, not blacked out, just fell asleep. My friend was the only one who drank heavily, easily the equivalent of 6 (maybe a couple more at most) 2. At absolutely no point have I ever indicated I was going to take action or demand (my particular wording was request above, not demand) before talking to my fianc\u00e9e about the whole story and the issue. I now intend to talk to the bridesmaid as well before I request anything 3. I understand I\u2019m being a little overly sensitive. The reality is this whole situation has been harsh and shitty for everyone involved. In particular I know I\u2019ve been very defensive of my friend given her current situation with her family and it is entirely possible some of this anger towards bridesmaid was redirected from things my friends sisters have said and done to her in recent history. All this being said there is absolutely positively nothing more between me and my friend besides a deeply PLATONIC relationship. I do not have romantic/sexual feelings to my friend at all. Nor am I \u201cinsecure about society telling me I can\u2019t have women friends without wanting to sleep with them\u201d. I\u2019m just worried about my friend who\u2019s still in a pretty bad place and feel like very insulted someone would insinuate I would be taking advantage of her in such a state 4. She has not been living with us for 5 months, she found out she was pregnant 5 months ago. Her miscarriage happened approximately 2 months and she moved into my place about 2 weeks after that",

We had a great time with our family, and it would have been better if it weren't for my SIL (husband's sister), who kept calling our son by the wrong name. You see, their cousin also had a baby boy, who is two months older than our son, and SIL kept confusing his name with ours. IMO, I think she simply forgets her nephew's name. In our three-day stay at their parents' house, she regularly called him by the wrong name. My husband and the rest of the family were only amused by it, and would constantly remind her. So did I, but I reached the point where it pissed me off. When she called him by the wrong name again, I snapped. I told her that whoever she's calling is not here, and if she had paid attention, maybe she would notice that this is a different baby. After an awkward silence, she apologized and assured me that it wouldn't happen again. But the rest of the stay went by awkwardly. After returning, my husband told me that it was unwarranted, and I was mean to his sister for an honest mistake. Since I knew that she struggled with people's names, I should have given her some time. He did ask me to apologize to SIL, and I will. But, still, AITA here?",

        "selftext": "My wife and I, along with my mother and aunt went out to lunch today.  The previous day, my wife and I had agreed we would try to pay for our own share of the bill rather than having my mother or aunt get it.  Last night, around 11pm, after my wife had gone to sleep, I had a conversation with my mother that I would just grab the check rather than mess around and fight over the bill.  I did forget to mention this to my wife (I work overnights and had just started my shift, and by the end I had forgotten).  So anyway, at lunch today when the check came, they asked if we wanted separate checks or all on one?  I responded, all on one is fine, then my wife said she had thought we were getting our own.  I said we could just get it.  This maybe happened over 2 or 3 seconds and I didn't think much of it. After lunch she was mad because I put her in a position where she said she came off very inconsiderate with her comment about getting our own checks (and thus, others would be paying their own).  I assured her no one thought that and it was not a big deal, but was still angry that I had put her in the position and she would have never said anything if I had told her prior to lunch.  I apologized for not letting her know in advance, as I never want to hurt my wife's feelings, but I maintained it wasn't a big deal, no one thought that she was being inconsiderate at all.   It's not about the money at all, everyone at the table could easily afford treating everyone else, she is mad about the position I put her in.  I really don't think this is a big deal, the whole interaction was 3 seconds tops, and no one thought anything of it. TL/DR:  AITA for thinking my wife inquiring about paying our own way at lunch (and thus, others paying their own way) is not a big deal?   Thanks!",

While traveling, we naturally encountered traffic jams and during some of the more abrupt stops, he put on the hazard lights of the car whilst braking. I brought it up that I find it kinda weird that he does this, and maybe it isn\u2019t necessary. I guess beyond the fact that I\u2019ve never heard of someone else doing this, I worry about other drivers around us. I told him what if the person behind you takes it the wrong way\u2026 but that\u2019s probably me over analyzing. Idk it seems like a bit of overkill?  He got frustrated with me for being a backseat driver and asked me to stop nitpicking (paraphrasing) his driving. I get that, I guess I just still think it\u2019s weird! So, AITA? Do people think this is normal? For clarification, we both live in the US, he grew up in the midwest, I\u2019m from the easy coast, and we were mostly on major highways during our drive UPDATE It has been so interesting to see how some people, like me, have never seen this before, while it is custom practice in other countries. Boyfriend is very proud to be driving like the best, I am excited for him and really admire his cleverness (he started this of his own accord and also rarely sees it on the road). Definitely have learned something and have had my mind changed!  I admit I am still learning how to not backseat drive and comment on small things. I agree that at the crux of this is my nature to control. I really didn\u2019t mean the word \u201cweird\u201d to be mean, however. I am a naturally curious person, and I really appreciate the comments from those in long-term partnerships offering really great suggestions for communication in the form of curiosity rather than criticism/critique. My favorite perspective that I saw a few times is he may have been overly cautious since I was in the car. We read many of these together and when he saw that, he agreed that is a big part of it for him.  I am lucky to be in a relationship where these instances of using the wrong language are not the end of the world, still I am going to work on my approach and reflect on why I feel the need to comment. As an aside, we actually got the idea to post this from the Podcast Smosh Reads Reddit Stories, which we listened to a lot on our long drive. This was my first post and have never really explored reddit, so I agree with those saying this could\u2019ve been better suited for other forums like no stupid questions. And yes, I googled. And no, there wasn\u2019t a clear answer. Unfortunately, in the US, every state has different road laws, making it hard to find a clear answer.

        "selftext": "I (45M) got a call from my ex wife (40F) saying she wanted to talk. This is very unusual for us considering we don't communicate unless it has to do with our kids. We have 3 children in their early teen. I reluctantly agreed and was then bombarded with questions.  She wanted to know why didn't I tell her I broke up with my ex girlfriend (43F)? How come everyone else was informed when it happened and she was just finding out months after that fact? Why have I been letting my ex girlfriend and her kids live with me and our children if they weren't together anymore? Does this mean she and her husband are allowed to come over and see the children now? By now she was emotional and crying. She told me I was an asshole for not telling her it happen as that means this opened up the door for her to be closer to our children.  I sighed and told her that this didn't change anything and my dating life is none of her business. I didn't tell her the first time my girlfriend and I got together either. The only reason I had told her about my girlfriend and her 3 children was because they were moving in.  I explained to her I was going to tell her about my break up when my ex girlfriend and kids had moved out. She didn't like my girlfriend anyway, so I also didn't want to tell her because I didn't want to hear the 'I told you so's. This didn't change anything having to do with our children so its none of her business. She then freaks out and calls me an asshole. She says she doesn't give a crap about me and my dating life. She  says my girlfriend was the main reason we had so much turmoil in co parenting. She, my ex girlfriend, was the reason she, my ex wife, wasn't allowed at the house. She was the reason my family had to have 2 of each holiday as she refused to be in the same room as my ex wife. My ex wife then tells me, if she would have known we broke up when it happened, then she could have been spending quality time with our children in their home. I told her she knows now so we can move forward in co parenting our children then hung up. A little context. I have full custody of our children. My ex wife had a mental break down and was deemed unfit. She still sees them every other weekend. She and her boyfriend, now husband, use to come over the whole day to see the kids. When my girlfriend moved in, she said she didn't feel comfortable with my Ex wife coming over. So we started having shorter outside visits. After that conversation I went to my parents house and asked them who told my ex wife. Expectantly my mother says she had let it slip, but she also had no idea my ex wife didn't know as its been 4 months since the break up. Both of my parents think I'm an asshole for not telling my ex wife. Am I?",

        "selftext": "My wife and I rented one half of a duplex for 4 years. In that time, we adopted our cat, Addie. A year and a half ago, there was a fire caused by someone on the other half of the duplex. The house was destroyed. We lost a lot, but luckily Addie was okay. We temporarily moved in with my brother\u2019s family. They were amazing to us. The kids loved Addie.  It soon became clear that our landlord was going to have to tear down the duplex and rebuild as the damage was that bad. We needed to find a new place to live. After endless searching, we realized all the vacancies that we could afford in our area didn\u2019t allow cats. My brother and SIL generously offered to keep Addie while we tried to get off the waitlist at a pet friendly apartment. In the past year and a half, we\u2019ve visited their home frequently and have gotten to see Addie.  To add, if it matters, my brother\u2019s family began financially taking care of her. Including vet bills, food, etc. They refused to take our money.  The more time that passed, I knew the odds of us being able to take Addie back were slim. My SIL works from home so Addie\u2019s gotten used to someone being around. Whereas my wife and I work in offices in a different city. The kids were also growing more attached. I tried to have this conversation with my wife multiple times but she was in denial. Last month, we finally got off the waitlist for a better apartment that allows pets. My wife instantly called my brother to ask about Addie. He asked that we meet with him and his wife for dinner.  As I expected, they asked if they could keep Addie. They said they had grown attached to her. That the kids would have a hard time but they felt Addie would too as she\u2019d gotten used to them and their lifestyle. I have to admit, Addie does seem happy there. My wife started to protest but I said we\u2019d think about it. At home, I told her this was for the best. She got pissed and said she wants Addie back. That we had a deal. I said we need to think about what\u2019s best for Addie and also what\u2019s fair to everyone. Ultimately, she reluctantly agreed. We still see Addie, but my wife acts different when we\u2019re there. Sometimes I feel she resents my brother and his family for keeping Addie. But she won\u2019t discuss it. Recently, a friend asked if we\u2019d ever get another cat. My wife said no as she feels I\u2019d just give it away again. I was hurt and said I never would\u2019ve given her away if not for the circumstances. She made it clear she\u2019ll never understand my choice. AITA?",

        "selftext": "For as long as I can remember my brother-in-law has been creepily obsessed with my sister but because he's attractive and has money everybody likes to pretend it's cute. I don't know how he convinced my sister to finally give him the time of day but that's a story for a different day. Anyway, they've been married for 4 years and have a 3 year-old daughter together.  I'm convinced that the only reason they even had a kid is because my sister has always wanted kids and she would've left his ass if he didn't agree to having one. The reason I think this is because he's outright said my sister is the most important person to him (even after their daughter had been born) and when their daughter was in the hospital he only came home because my sister told him she was scared and not because he was worried about their daughter (he admitted this himself). I think my niece and sister both deserve better but I usually bite my tongue to keep the peace and because he has a way of always making the other person look like the bad guy in front of others so I knew I would get a lot of backlash if I said anything to him. BUT recently he missed his daughter's birthday because he went on a work trip that he could've moved or cancelled so since my niece is so young my sister celebrated her birthday twice since she wouldn't really know the difference. During her second birthday party he was completely unbothered and wasn't giving his daughter any attention (he was too busy watching my sister the entire time). I felt so bad for her because she's a complete daddy's girl and just wanted him to play with her on her birthday and he wasn't encouraging her at all. The only time he bothered to give her attention was when my sister was around. Eventually it was just me and my brother-in-law and I told him he should give his daughter more attention and he just scoffed and claimed he did (he absolutely doesn't). I asked him if it had been my sister's birthday would he have went on that trip and he wouldn't answer because we both know the answer is no. I can't remember exactly what else was said but he told me to mind my own business and I was feeling pretty angry on my niece's behalf so I told him that he shouldn't be surprised when one day she was all grown up and hated his guts. I also said that my sister would catch on and she would hate him too which I think got to him more than the comment about my niece. As I mentioned before he has a way of making the other person look bad so he spun a story to my sister and now she's upset with me because I won't apologise to him. AITA?",

She said Amelia adores my boys but many of her friends have sons and she just can\u2019t accommodate them all. She was apologetic and I ended the conversation because it was awkward.

        "selftext": "5 years ago, my sister (25 at the time) decided she wanted to open a preschool. My dad was completely on board, helped her pick out a piece of land, bought the land, got her set up with a modular building company, paid for the building, donated supplies, and paid for everything for the first year. Every year his company donates thousands of dollars to her school. They provide backpacks, lunchboxes, and water bottles to each of her students every year, they donate food on special occasions, they fund graduation every year, and they provide teacher gifts for Christmas and ed of the year. She talked about wanting to expand and his company donated a whole ass building and new playground.  I (27f) want to open a salon. I asked my dad to help me open it like he did with my sister's school. He recommended I spend a few more years working then he'll consider it.  I reminded him that he helped my sister when she was 2 years younger than me but he said it's different because she started babysitting at 11, working at a swim school at 13, started working with preschoolers at summer camps by 15, and got a job as a preschool teacher fresh out of high school. He also said she had a good understanding of how the business would work and had great ideas for location and specialization to attract parents. I told him I do have good ideas but he's just not willing to listen and spend half of what he did on my sister on my business.  He said the only way he'll reconsider is if I get at least an associates in business, get a job in my field and keep it for 3+ years, and save at least half of the start up costs. All of this has to happen within 4 years.  We got into an argument and I called him a dick for supporting my sister and spending tens or hundreds of thousands on her business but either refusing or making me jump through hoops for me to get half of what she got. He says I'm being ungrateful and unrealistic and can't expect something just because my sister has it. ",

He had got all defensive and said why am I always putting them before him. He said there has been multiple times where me and him couldn\u2019t do something because I had to do things with another family member. He also said it was getting annoying and that he kind of regrets dating someone who was so close with their family to which I replied: \u201cIt\u2019s not my fault I have a family that actually cares about me and didn\u2019t neglect me for drugs\u201d He got all quiet after that and hung up. I tried calling back multiple times and he\u2019s not answering. Idk if I should text and apologize or just leave it alone. Edit: I sent him a long message apologizing for what I said he hasn\u2019t answered yet I think he might be sleep hope he sees it in the morning. Update: I thought he would wait until the morning but he randomly FaceTimed me saying that he was also sorry about what he said as well it was basically us back and forth apologizing lol. Anyways tomorrow we are gonna meet up to do a deeper discussion as I want to properly apologize to him in person about what I said and I let him know I\u2019m truly sorry. Update 2: Okay we met up at this restaurant and talked about it. I explained multiple times that I was sorry and that I should have never used his trauma as a jab towards him. He also apologized for telling me to stop seeing my family. I told him I\u2019d cancel the plans with my dad and any other plans in the future if it means we can continue the relationship as I didn\u2019t want to lose him. He got all happy about that and now I\u2019m over at his house and we\u2019re just chilling together. Thanks everybody for the advice I got a lot of messages telling me how to apologize and what to say if I really wanted to continue going through this with him.

My fiance has a daughter from a previous marriage as well, Kiki (15). All 3 girls are in my wedding party, with Kiki as a bridesmaid. I\u2019m letting all of my bridal party pick out their dresses, with the condition they\u2019re all the same color and within a certain budget. I\u2019m also paying for all of them. Kiki sent me a link to the dress she liked and I thought it was pretty. I planned on ordering it once I had the other members of the wedding party sending me what they wanted. I was scrolling on Facebook one night and one of the buy/sell groups I\u2019m apart of showed the dress that Kiki sent me. It was only used once in a wedding and is in perfect condition. You can\u2019t even tell it was worn before. It also so happened to be in her size. So, I figured it\u2019d be cheaper to buy this as it\u2019s a dress she\u2019ll likely also wear once and never again. The dress new online is $200. The person was selling it for $50 and just wanted it gone. I\u2019ve seen the dress in person. No stains, no smells. Truly a steal. So, I bought it.  When I told Kiki, she got mad and said she was the only one not getting a brand new dress. I pointed out I\u2019m still getting her new shoes, accessories (again all of her choice), have alternations done to the dress as needed, she\u2019ll have her hair and makeup done with us. If I found any other member of the bridal party\u2019s dress in a similar condition and cheaper price in a Facebook group or a thrift store, I\u2019d buy it. As it is, I\u2019m spending about a grand on dresses for the 5 members of my bridal party. If I can save a little money, I will. Kiki wants me to buy her the brand new dress. I spoke with my fiance and he agrees with me. We told Kiki if she wants the dress brand new, she can pay the difference. She\u2019s still upset with us. Other members of my husband\u2019s family feels I\u2019m being a cheap ass and should just buy the dress new. AITA?",

        "selftext": "My husband (38M) and I (37F) have been married for 11-years and have 2 daughters (8 & 4).  I am currently 12-weeks pregnant with our third child.  I just had an ultrasound and we were able to determine the sex of the baby, a little boy.  We have found out the sex of all of our children this way.   My husband is a third.  As in, John Smith III.  Before we got married and were having discussions about kids, he did make it very clear that passing down his name was very important to him if we had a son.  At the time I thought it was really cute and adorable how much pride he took in it since most guys don't really care about that sort of sentimental stuff.  But as the years have gone by I've definitely cooled on the idea quite a bit and I don't think I want to have our son be named after my husband that way. Obviously, with our first 2 kids we didn't even have to think about it.  But when we were choosing names for our daughters, my husband was very much in the you can take the lead on naming our daughter because I already have the name picked out if we have a son camp.  It's not like he wasn't involved in naming our daughters, but he definitely deferred to my opinion.   So, when we found out we were having a boy, my husband was very excited.  On the car ride home after the ultrasound it was all he could talk about.  He was giddy like a teenager talking about how proud he would be of sharing his name with his son. I don't know if it was the best time to bring this up, but I kind of had one of those yeah, about that moments.  I told him how I know we had talked about this many times before with our other kids and that I technically agreed to it years ago, but I don't think I want to name our son the same as my husband. I don't think I've ever seen anyone's mood change so quickly and visibly as my husband's did in that moment.  It was like all the joy went out of his body all at once.  I told him that I just don't want our son to be a forth.  It seems tacky and has weird aristocratic vibes that just don't seem right to me.  I told him that I am not totally against the idea, but I don't want to just agree to it right now because I want time to think about other names too. He took that as me basically saying that I am going back on our years-long agreement and that there is no way we are naming our son after him.  He said this is pretty much me telling him maybe when I really mean no.   This has taken all of his excitement about the baby away.  He's been withdrawn and quiet with me ever since.  When I try to talk to him about it, he tells me he has nothing to say because he's been very clear about where he stands on this and he feels betrayed by my change of heart.   I asked him if he would want to think of some other names together and he told me to give him a list and he'll look at it when he can.  I know I technically agreed to this years ago, but it just doesn't feel right to me anymore.  ",

I knew my parents would give my kids lots of extras and offer me help with gifts when we didn't need it without doing the same for the others and at the time I had the view that what they did with their money or paid attention to wasn't any of my business. I couldn't help if they favored me growing up or my children now.\r  \r   My mother went from calling me to just talk or hang out to needing me or my husband to run errands for them constantly. Go over to their house to help them, take our father to his medical appointments, asked my husband to do maintenance around their house and yard. Things M and L primarily did for them. I understood how it would make them upset to do all of that for them just for our parents to give my daughters extra money, skip other events for my daughters' activities, help me with gifts when we make more than any of my siblings... I got it. That was pretty wrong of our parents so I apologized to my siblings.\r  \r  My daughters (15 and 13) know that their grandparents are having some issues with their aunts and uncles but they don't know the exact reason why. I thought it would be harmful to them to tell. They're the only ones that visit their grandparents and they know their grandparents don't show up to functions at the others' houses.\r  \r  Over the weekend M hosted a picnic. It was at a public park you can rent pavilions. To make a long story short, our parents showed up. M asked what they were doing there and they said my daughters invited them. I asked my girls about it and they said since it was at a park it should be fine. No one made a scene but afterwards M and L asked me what I planned to do about it since my daughters broke everyone else\u2019s boundaries. I said I wasn\u2019t going to do anything because I do think the girls have a point- it was at a public park and I won\u2019t punish them for wanting to see their grandparents. My siblings are pretty much doubling down that they shouldn\u2019t have been invited and they\u2019re aren\u2019t talking to me as much since I\u2019m not addressing it.\r  \r  AITA for not punishing my daughters?\r  ",

        "selftext": "I went on a hike with some friends this week, which we planned on doing over 5 days. After a day and half, I realized I was not physically fit enough to complete the rest of the hike, and made the decision that I was going to turn around before it was too late. For context, it\u2019s ~35 miles into a mountain range with 2000ft of elevation gain per day, I do not do much cardio or hiking, though I am relatively fit. I do have some cardiac issues and am particularly susceptible to altitude sickness, though it was certainly my fault for overestimating my abilities. I shouldn\u2019t have went in the first place, but to be honest, the trip was partially my idea.  However, I made it very clear to my friends that I myself was going to turn around, and I wanted them to complete it without me. At no point did I ever ask them to turn around, as a matter of fact I explicitly told them not to turn around with me as I didn\u2019t want to ruin the trip for them. Yet, they turned around with me, which I did appreciate, but I would rather them have finished it without me, as I made very clear to everyone. Of course we were a bit disappointed that we didn\u2019t finish it, but when they claimed it was my fault, I couldn\u2019t help but disagree. I argued for 30 minutes trying to get them to continue without me. I chose to turn around because I knew it would be a risk to all of us had I continued on, especially if things got worse, and we were already 10 miles deep so it was best to make the decision before it was too late. We also had no PLB or connection to the outside world, so there was no way to call for help if things got bad. I was willing to accept the risk that came with returning solo, as it is heavy grizzly bear country, but I did have bear defense. Once we finally got back, everyone claimed how I ruined their weekend. I can see why they think that, but I explicitly told them not to follow me back, and to continue the hike without me. They say it was my fault they didn\u2019t get to finish it. Tbh it made me feel like shit and I don\u2019t think I want to go on another trip with them because I don\u2019t want to risk ruining it. For a bit more context, these are my best friends whom I\u2019ve known my whole life. I don\u2019t hold any resentment towards them, and I am 100% confident we will remain friends for many years to come, if not for the rest of our lives. We are still hanging out today, but I can\u2019t help but feel like they hold some level of resentment for my decision to turn back on the hike.  Am I the asshole for ruining everyone\u2019s weekend? I thought I made the right choice but I feel as though I may not have.  Edit: thanks for your input everyone, I realize that I grossly overestimated my abilities and I apologized to the whole group. I am very grateful that they were looking out for me, and they are undoubtedly the best friends I could have. Nobody holds any resentment, we were just upset at the time.  Next time I will make sure I am prepared, and choose a trail within my skill level. ",

The other day my daughter came home and said the boy forgot his homework in her car and asked if I could take it to work with me so he wouldn't get in trouble for not turning in his work. I told her no, she'll have to drop it off at the school like everyone else and she started yelling at me that the school is 15 miles away (her school is only 3 miles from my work) and that she'll have to leave the house 2 hours early to get the work to him in time.

        "selftext": "I'll try to keep this as brief as possible. Just over a week ago, my wife gave birth to our first child. I got called about it during work and rushed to the hospital to be with her during the labour. It was obviously a very stressful time, as it took more than 15 hours from start to the end, but finally our little one was born and was healthy. I was in the room for nearly the entire time (other than briefly heading out for food, toilet etc), holding her hand and being the 'punching bag' as she swore during certain times during the worst of it. As it was getting towards the end, just as the head was coming out (and it all happened very quickly from then), more medical staff came into the room and I am someone who gets nervous around lots of people. I think because of that nervousness, I was talking a bit more, introducing myself to the new people coming in, making jokes (saying I hope it's not a bad omen that the weather is so bad, because a thunderstorm had started outside that we could hear) and then when our baby finally came out fully, at that second, I made the Age Of Empires 2 'new villager' sound (Shhhh hoooh) as a joke, but I think only my wife understood the reference (as the doctor and nurses gave no reaction) and the look she gave me could have sunk a thousand ships, she looked so so angry, before then seeing our little one and finally smiling (but didn't look at me for about half an hour, and even then she was really annoyed for the rest of the day). Anyway, I thought it was a joke that went down badly in a moment of high anxiety, but my wife has twice in the past week told me that I ruined a moment that she hoped would be one of the best in her life. I've apologised both times, but she has this look I've not seen before, something beyond disappointment. It's really put a downer on the past nine days of what I thought would be our happiest time together, after what was obviously a very stressful time (for her mostly, of course). AITA?",

So utilities are all included, but for some reason, my roommate thinks that they\u2019re entitled to leave their Alexa powered light on maybe 16 hours a day 7 days a week. There is no plants or animals in their room, so I feel as if they don\u2019t need to leave their light on even when they\u2019re not home.

With the older two, she was going back to work at 12 weeks, had them in daycare all day every day, didn\u2019t breastfeed, and just seemed disinterested in becoming a parent. It\u2019s night and day with this baby though. She quit her job so the baby wouldn\u2019t be in daycare, she\u2019s into attachment parenting, refused to even try formula for this one, and refuses to go anywhere without her.  They\u2019re going to move for my son\u2019s job and are taking the weekend to look at houses and explore the area. My DIL asked if I could take the older two and when I asked about the baby, she said the baby would be coming with them. I asked why she was taking the baby and not the older two and she said it would be so much easier. She doesn\u2019t have to worry about the kids running around the stages houses, getting bored after touring 5 houses, getting tired, etc. and that the baby will happily stay in the carrier or in her stroller. She also mentioned that the baby has never been away from her and she doesn\u2019t want to put her through 2 nights away from mom yet. She also wants to take the baby out and she thinks it\u2019ll be easier to check out the kid places with only one kid.  I refused. I told her that I think it\u2019s favoritism to take one kid on vacation and leave the others at home, especially when she already has a history of treating her better than the other kids. The other kids would love to go on this trip and they won\u2019t understand why their mom left them but brought their sister.  She says I have no right to criticize her parenting and that she does not have a favorite. I refused to budge and told her I\u2019d take all of them or none. She has a friend watching the older two now and told her that I am not allowed to see the kids this weekend because she thinks I\u2019ll talk about her to the kids and cause problems between her and the kids.

        "selftext": "Son's birthday today. He's 5 years old. I wasnt there this morning as stay away from home some nights due to work. Even if had slept at home would have left for work before the kids woke. We have a party planned on Saturday, and will be there at dinner time tonight. I realised that my wife gave my son a present this morning. She said it was from 'us. Apparently she does this every year. I was hurt, and told her so. I thought it was selfish that she couldn't wait to share his excitement.  Her excuse is that it is unfair on him to make him wait. find that ridiculous, and believe he absolutely could wait.  I said the only reason to give it early is the selfishness of wanting to experience his joy alone without sharing it. AITA?  Edit(s): This blew up quicker than I expected (I couldn't get online for the last hour). And overwhelmingly with YTA responses, many with some unfair assumptions so I want to add some context in my defence although I think it wont change the general outcome. 1. Today is his birthday, although we have other special plans. Next week I'm taking 3 days off work, two of which are for a family trip and the third is a special day for my son. I couldn't get today off work though, and Saturday is his proper party, which I obviously will be there. I have a 1.5 hour commute each way (hence why I don't normally see him in the morning before he gets up for school), but I normally read the bedtime story when I'm home and I video call EVERY evening that I'm not home. I'm not an absentee father, and I'm not just a sperm donor. 2. My wife has bought most of the presents but not all of them. We tend to put things in gift bags not wrap them. Last year it was me that bought the main present, this year there wasn't a main present, it was mostly a few smaller ones because the family trips mentioned in (1) are really his main present. I don't expect her to do all the gift shopping and give all the ideas, I do a share of it. She does have more free time than me, and does more of the childcare than me. That's a problem of our (shared) lifechoices and not something that we can easily change. My long commute is primarily due to decisions on her part. 3. Yes, she said she does this every year, but first and second birthday are not quite the same level of concious response, and 3rd and 4th I am not sure what she gave him in the morning. As I mentioned, last year I got the 'main' present, and that was given in the evening I am definitely jealous if she is giving him presents. I definitely want to be part of the enjoyment of his birthday.  I was hurt and didn't understand why he had to receive the present when I wasn't there. Yep he's 5 years old, and every family is different. I don't remember receiving presents until the whole family was there in the evening. I thought that was normal, and assumed my wife had the same thoughts. We hadn't discussed it, and I was upset for missing out.I think if I knew, then I wouldn't have reacted that way, but it was a shock and I was upset. I still am jealous and have some feelings to work through. I don't like my work situation and commute, but I really don't see a way to resolve it (without significant financial risk that I'm not willing to take in this climate) so will have to suck up my disappointment. I called my wife selfish for getting the joy, alone without discussing it first, or without giving me the chance to join on video call. I guess I need to take the YTA verdict. Edit(again):Too many comments to respond to, and can't respond for at least a few hours so that I can spend time with my son on his birthday!",

        "selftext": "I won't go into my kids and their cousins achievements. They are many and impressive. I have supported all of their interests with time and money.  I made a fair bit of money a long time ago and I basically retired very young. I tried being a trust fund douche bag but I wasn't cut out for it. I worked hard to get my money and I wasn't raised wealthy. I was just very lucky during the dotcom boom.  I have three children and three nephews, on niece. I am doing my best not to brag about them. So I will say this. They took my money and time and used it to make amazing things happen for them.  And I celebrate their achievements. Both scholastic and athletic. I throw parties for them and I give them great presents.  My son is jealous because I do not have parties for his achievements.  He is a great kid and quite smart. He isn't a natural athlete but neither am I by any stretch of the imagination. He dies well in school but I know that I will be paying out of pocket for him to attend whatever school he gets into.  I also host parties for him and his friends. I just don't celebrate him as much.  He had complained about this. So last week I asked him what achievement he wants to celebrate.  I shit you not his answer was that he had maxed out his fishing stat in Final Fantasy 14.  I know all those words. I even know that game. What I do not get is how a fifteen year old kid thinks that is on the same level as getting scouted for a Div 1 athletic scholarship.  I said he could have a party but that I wasn't sending out invites with that as the reason.  He is upset and my wife thinks I'm being judgmental. Which I am. I am judging him. And wondering where the hell I went wrong. I'll answer a couple  of questions I know will be asked.  Yes I love my son very much.  Yes he is on the spectrum.  No I don't think that is worth celebrating.  No I cannot bring myself to celebrate that.  AITA?",

        "selftext": "Sorry for any mistakes, I\u2019m a bit drunk and feeling too confident in my english skills. (Edit: I wasn't drunk while this happened. My boyfriend and I had some wine while watching a movie) We\u2019re both men. My family was not happy when I came out but they\u2019ve mostly stopped voicing their opinions openly. I know they still talk about it in private but at least they don\u2019t say anything to our faces. It took some time for them to warm up to my boyfriend but now they actively include him in conversations and my 87 year old grandma called him a \u201cvery lovely young man\u201d while pinching his cheek which is a very high form of approval from her. The one thing they still don\u2019t like us to do in front of them is when we act like a couple. They actually try to keep us separate most of the time to not give us the chance to do something as scandalous as hold hands or kiss. This afternoon we were invited to one of my cousin\u2019s birthdays. At some point my boyfriend and I were alone in the kitchen and I, thinking he looked very cute and kissable in that very moment, committed the ultimate sin. I called him something along the lines of \u201cmy pretty doll\u201d and gave him a quick kiss. Of course one of my cousins had to enter the kitchen at that exact moment and (because she is a 5 year old who probably didn\u2019t know that we\u2019re a couple and has never seen us be affectionate) ran off to excitedly tell the other kids what she saw, which was met with the typical childish reactions of disgust mixed with curiosity. My favorite was actually my nephew asking me if that means that my boyfriend is my wife now. The adults didn\u2019t find that as funny though and I had to listen to my mother berate me for almost 30 minutes. When she finally let me go, my boyfriend asked if we could leave. I told him we\u2019d stay for dinner and leave immediately after. Now comes the part where I might (and probably am) the asshole. I made a point of holding my boyfriend\u2019s hand while we walked back to the table and asked one of my nieces if she\u2019d switch seats so my boyfriend and I could sit next to each other. During dinner I kept asking my boyfriend to hand me things on the table while addressing him by nicknames and giving him a peck on the cheek here and there. To say the mood was awkward would be an understatement. The adults just mostly ignored us and just glared at us every few seconds while the younger kids kept giggling every time I called my boyfriend \u201cdarling\u201d or \u201csweetheart\u201d. My boyfriend was uncomfortable and barely looked up from his plate.  We left immediately after dinner was finished. My boyfriend was very quiet on our way home and when we got home he broke down crying. I comforted him as best as I could but I know it\u2019s my fault that he\u2019s upset as well.  Later this evening, my mother also sent me a long message telling me that \u201cour behavior\u201d was immature and inappropriate and that, until we\u2019d stop forcing our choices on everyone, we wouldn\u2019t be welcome at another family gathering.",

        "selftext": "I (35F) and my husband (33M) live together with our two children (3M & 1F).  Recently I have been under the weather with some low level cold & sore throat. I\u2019m feeling crappy but still able to do day to day stuff, I have been going to work, looking after the children etc as normal.  Today the children are due to be looked after by our childminders who live next door to us, we can drop them off anywhere between 8-9am. We get them up and dressed and feed them breakfast before they go and pack their bags with spare clothes, nappies, bottles for our daughter and food for both of them throughout the day.  Today I have a dentist appointment in the town over at 10am. My husband is due to attend a viewing of a primary school in the village next to us in the opposite direction at 9:20am with my mother who is making her own way there.  This morning I got up when my alarm went off with my son, got him dressed and gave him his breakfast, went back upstairs for our daughter, got her dressed and gave her her bottle then started making their lunches which included washing up as there were no clean bottles for her to take with her. My husband remained in bed until 8:50am then came downstairs and asked why I was stressed and grumpy. I told him that I\u2019d got up by myself with both children, needed to leave for my appointment in ten minutes and the kids bags still weren\u2019t packed and the car was frozen and I still wasn\u2019t dressed myself. He then asked what he could do to help and I asked him to defrost the car which he did.  When we had dropped the kids off at 9am I started getting myself dressed and he asked I was \u2018even going to have time\u2019 to take him to the primary school (we only have one car and only I have a drivers licence), I said no and was he expecting me to take him and he said yes because I had organised the trip to the primary school.  I pointed out that while I have organised for him to go to the primary school I am not actually going myself. Not only that I have plans, which he knows about, at the same time in a different location in the opposite direction. Also at no point has he asked me for a lift. He says I should have known he would be expecting a lift there as I planned the visit.  In addition to the above, if I was going to give him a lift we would have needed to leave earlier so I could drop him off and make my appoint on time but he didn\u2019t get up with me and get the children out of the house and everything ready so we could do this.  I left for my dentist appointment while he complained he was going to be late and started trying to book a taxi at around 9:10am.  So AITA for not giving my husband a lift to the school viewing?  For info - at 9:05 once we realised he was expecting a lift and I wasn\u2019t expecting to give him one if we had left immediately to drop him off I would probably have been about 5 minutes late to my appointment, maybe just made it if traffic was ok but the ground is frosty today so driving conditions weren\u2019t great.  For info #2 - also, for everyone in the comments who is at an absolute loss for how he was supposed to get himself there without a lift, The school is a ten minute drive from our house and taxis are very cheap where we live, it would have cost him approximately \u00a35 to get a cab there.  Update - ok ok I get it, I\u2019m TA for going to the dentist with a cold haha. Although yes I do take on board all the comments highlighting our issues with communication, going forward we\u2019re going to have a briefing for the next day where we\u2019re clear about who is getting up in the morning, what our plans are and how we\u2019re getting there. Also for those dragging my husband for being a third child, despite how he was acting yesterday he\u2019s usually a very involved partner and father who takes on many jobs around the household and does his fair share of parenting. He used to get up in the night with our daughter and I would do the early mornings which worked well for us however our daughter no longer really wakes up in the night and he has continues to have the lie ins so I think we just need to update our division of labour in that regard. Thanks to everyone who\u2019s posted measured and detailed responses, I\u2019ve found a lot of helpful advice. ",

        "selftext": "Context, my brother and I (30s M and F) live together and we don't have our parents left because they both died within our lifetime. One of our parents had a best friend who we will call, Emily (60s F). Emily has been a wonderful family friend to my brother and me ever since we were kids. And she's become like a second mother to us. However, she's sent us cookies for the last few years as Christmas gifts. And these aren't homemade cookies, these are cookies from some catalog that, to be honest taste like cardboard. And as a result, we don't eat them and they expire to the point where they become unedible because they're so stale. And for me, I truly hate wasting food because it could've gone to people who are struggling to eat. I've tried to donate the cookies as soon as possible many times before, but our schedules get in the way of everything along with Holiday hours as soon as we get the gift. So many areas start either closing too early for us, or some events prevent us from donating so there's a very small time frame in which the cookies can be donated. So as a result my brother and I concluded, we have to tell Emily that while we appreciate the thought and all, we don't want any more of these cookies for Christmas especially because we don't eat them. We feel bad for Emily because she spends her hard-earned money on a gift that goes to waste every year. However, here's where I may be TA. I talked to my therapist about this and she told me, But it's usually the thought that counts you might be hurting her feelings if you tell her. Now to clarify we're not going to ask for another gift or anything, we just don't want her to waste all of her money on stuff we don't even eat. We don't even mind not getting a gift, we just don't want the cookies anymore because they just go to waste, they taste awful, and we can't even find the time to donate them. So Reddit WIBTA for telling Emily in a polite manner that we don't want any more cookies for Christmas anymore? EDIT: WOW! I didn't expect this to blow up the way it did. I'll let my brother know about this information. As I said before we literally don't want anything but at least we can try to find a food pantry or just give every single one away at a place like a supermarket for some random person to find and eat.",

A few months ago, I did some digging and found out that his charity isn\u2019t registered as a nonprofit. He has a website but its a regular company.

At the reunion I listened to him talk about all the good his charity was doing, I couldn\u2019t take it anymore. I stood up and asked him to explain why it isn't registered after so long, and why there is no proof that he actually donated money. Jake tried to defend himself, and it was obviously very uncomfortable for him and embarrassing.

I\u2019ll just be blunt she\u2019s a lovely person, but her cooking is awful. I\u2019ve tried to be polite and eat it at past dinners, but every time I\u2019ve either gotten sick or just couldn\u2019t finish the food. It\u2019s bland, overcooked, or just plain inedible. This time, I decided to bring my own food. I didn\u2019t make a big deal out of it, just quietly put my dish on my plate when everyone else was eating. But my sister in law noticed and asked why I wasn\u2019t eating what she made. I didn\u2019t want to lie, so I said I had some dietary restrictions which is true to some extent, but not the whole reason. She seemed hurt and asked if I didn\u2019t like her cooking. I tried to downplay it, saying it\u2019s just easier for me to bring my own food because of my diet. Well, now my brother is upset with me, saying I embarrassed his wife in front of the family. My parents think I could\u2019ve just eaten a little bit of her food to be polite. But I didn\u2019t want to go through another meal of forcing down food I couldn\u2019t stomach.",

        "selftext": "Update going to leave it at this thanks to everyone especially to u/YesterdaySimilar2069.  He is right.  Edit: For clarification the request about how the money was spent was because I spent extra for a costume since I was not sure I would be back in time to go pick it out with him. She said she would take him to get what he wanted. So I sent her extra money ontop of the ordered amount.  Reason I asked for where did the money go was because she has not stated the original amount is not enough nor made a request to increase it.  This counts for living expenses also. If she needs more she can ask I have never not send her extra if it is something our son needs. Though the amount in question does cover rent food clothing other general living expenses. So yeah I will question if she states I need more for food when I just sent her money. Which has happened so our order is fairly detailed in what the money is supposed to be used for. Since she has lied in the past. Edit as per requested I sent an extra 400 over because my son wanted a light saber he saw at gamestop which alone was 235 dollars. She did agree verbally that she would take him and get him the stuff he wanted. I sent her the money on the 1st together with the child support payment.   So my son's mother and I did not work out. I travel 6 to 8 months out the year due to work. His mother has primary custody and I do send the ordered amount and some extra when I can.  Fast forward to Sunday I am back for the Holidays. I plan to take my son out for Halloween. He wants to be a Jedi, so I showed him my Jedi costume and asked to see the one his mother bought-I did send her extra to get the costume since I knew I would be back before Halloween just was not sure I would be back in time to get him the costume-she told him that's I was going to buy it.  I was upset but just played it off and said oh that is right and it was in the mail. Thankfully I found a costume  Yesterday.  I did reach out to his mother when I had a moment in private to ask her where did the money I sent go. She told me that I have no right to question what she does with the money. Our child's needs are being met and that is all that matters. She has primary custody and gets majority say. I told her that the money was meant for our child not her.  She was not awarded spousal support. This is where I am getting mixed messages and where I wish to know if what I said made me the asshole.  My mom said I was being the prick by questioning how she was raising our child when I am not around. I do not think I questioning her parenting but I did question how she used the money I sent. She said she would get him the costume.  If she needed extra for something that is related to him I will always send extra. Yes, early on I was more accommodating. While she was not granted spousal support I did cover her rent and also childcare but she took forever to get a job and when she did get a job it was a retail job even though she has a teaching degree.

        "selftext": "So I haven\u2019t been on a proper holiday in about 10 years. This year I\u2019ve booked to go away to Europe for 6 weeks because fuck it, it looks like I\u2019ll never afford a house so I might as well have some fun with my savings. I had a conversation with my housemates at the start of the year and my understanding was they would look after my dog as long as I arranged alternative accomodation for him on 3 of the 6 weekends and during one of the weeks so they could go away. I agreed to this and asked them to let me know when they intended to go away and I would organise something else. Tonight they sat me down and said they no longer want to look after my dog anymore and it was unfair of me to expect them to in the first place as it\u2019s a long time and stops them from going away and living their lives. They also told me the previous conversation was only a conversation and not an agreement. They suggested I send him home to my Mum ($1200 return flight) or drive him home to my Mum (4 day drive there and back; I live in Australia). When I said I didn\u2019t want to spend that money or time and thought he\u2019d be happier staying with them at home with his best dog mate for the majority of the time their response was \u201cwell you\u2019re about to spend 6 weeks in Europe, you can afford it\u201d. Some extra context: I\u2019m a carpenter and last year spent way more than 6 weekends helping them fit out a van for free so they could do trips away/rent it out for some extra cash (it\u2019s a fancy af fit out as one of my housemates is an architect). I genuinely wanted to help and my housemate said all along that one day he\u2019d return the favour in some way. I also look after their dog regularly when they go away (they have also looked after my dog when I\u2019ve gone away up until now). I feel like I\u2019ve been gaslit a little bit as if the first conversation never happened and they don\u2019t understand why I\u2019m annoyed. Am I an asshole? EDIT: This year we have organised a calendar as we are all away a bit so all of us have had notice of any comings and going\u2019s since the start of this year. I\u2019m away for a 6 week block (to clarify they aren\u2019t looking after my dog for this entire time as our agreement was I\u2019d find alternate accomodation for him for some of the time, which I have done). They are away for about 4 weeks total over the course of the year when I will be looking after their dog. Also a lot of people saying I should have offered them money, I offered them $100 a week but they declined.",

        "selftext": "Hi AITA, I have a 5 year old cardigan corgi. He\u2019s an absolute unit, and as my friends say, he\u2019s high in strength/constitution and low in intelligence/wisdom. He often tries to eat things that aren\u2019t safe for him.  I live alone and hired a dog walker I found on Rover to visit him once a day during the work week. Instead of going through the app, I agreed to pay her in cash. She\u2019s generally been great. But, we\u2019ve had a few mishaps like her not telling me when my dog ate and tore up a wooden hand fan. I\u2019ve given her the benefit of the doubt because my dog loves her and enjoys his walks with her.  Last night, my dog vomited up five or so partially chewed, large, bright-orange seeds. They are from the coontie plant and are in the same family as sago palms, which can be fatally toxic to dogs even in small amounts. Unfortunately, they are part of the landscape in my \u201cdog-friendly\u201d apartment complex.  I decided not to wait it out and took my dog to the emergency vet. They admitted him to critical care because the risk of him deteriorating was so high, even though he was in good spirits when I left him.  I messaged my dog walker to let her know what happened, and she insists she never saw him eat the seeds and that she tries to prevent him from eating things on the ground. I know he did not eat the seeds on my watch, because I exclusively took him to the turf-only dog park yesterday, which isn\u2019t near the toxic plants.  This emergency vet visit is costing thousands of dollars. I haven\u2019t brought up the cost to her yet, but WIBTA to request that she contributes to this huge expense? I get it\u2019s my dog, but also I have never let this happen on my watch. I understand it was likely an honest mistake, but also I feel as though it\u2019s really irresponsible to let someone\u2019s dog eat random things off the ground, especially if you aren\u2019t paying close attention.  Edit \u2014 Thanks everyone for your feedback. I will absolutely accept that I would be TA if I asked my walker to contribute to my vet bills. I had several people in my life reach out and suggest I ask, hence this post.  I will not be asking her to pay. I will, however, invest in good pet insurance and will only pay dog walkers through Rover from now on.  I will clarify a few things for the sake of this post. - Yes, I pointed out the unsafe area. - Yes, she knows he will eat things off the ground, but she also knows he is trained and responsive to several commands including \u201cleave it\u201d, \u201cdrop it\u201d, and \u201cwait\u201d.  - This plant is only in specific parts of the complex, which are easily avoidable. - Yes, multiple sources have confirmed this was a life-threatening situation for my dog due to what was ingested.  Edit Part 2: Electric Boogaloo \u2014 Thank you AGAIN for everyone\u2019s feedback. My Hoover of a dog is doing okay, his labs look good and hopefully he\u2019s coming home soon.  A few more things I\u2019ll add: - I will absolutely be investing in a muzzle.- like some of you have suggested, it might be worthwhile to invest in a more vetted walker (instead of Rover)- I am very blessed, and my low rider Unit of a dog\u2019s bills are paid (yes, by some of the very people who asked whether I was going to ask my current walker for compensation)- I walked my apartment complex\u2019s property this morning. On the very far side of my building, there is a line of these palms that were apparently just trimmed, and there are huge piles of the seeds all lined up. Dog walker admitted to letting my Dyson Dog \u201csniff\u201d the seeds, so \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f- it\u2019s a moot point because there are lots of things I will do moving forward to prevent this from happening again (boy I\u2019m dense, I genuinely don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t think of a muzzle in the first place \u2014 I\u2019ve used things like grazing muzzles for my horses before). - Medical scares and renewed agency are one hell of a drug. - I do want to say, I\u2019ve truly been trying my best. I came here for feedback, and I got what I needed to move forward and keep my dumb dog safe. Reddit gives me tough love, and even when it stings, I\u2019m grateful. - I talked to the front office staff about the plants. If anything, maybe some signs can be posted. ",

        "selftext": "So... I am very pregnant right now. Still in the first trimester, but rhe symptoms HIT. I am nauseaus all day and i cant eat anything warm really, i have been living on cold sandwiches and fruits, because that is all my body can tolerate right now. My sense of smell is also hightened.  So, my coworker loves tuna. He eats everything with tuna, specifically a spanish brand with tomate puree in it. I used to like it, before i was pregnant, even though the smell is quite... strong.  The problem is he doesnt keep the tuna refrigerated, he literally pulls it out of his work bag, and especially in the summer, he stinks everything up.  Usually i do notice but i can manage, but lately, i cant stay around that smell. I have barfed way more than i wanted to admit.  Yesterday, after I came back from my barfing i asked him if he could please eat something else. My throat is hurting from barfing everyday and i just cant anymore  Dude got red in the face and left the breakroom ( he left his tuna too).  Now people are calling me an assshole, they told me i am not entitled to dictate what someene else eats.  I tried to explain, but apparently hr is also involved too.  So was I really the AH? Edit : thank you all for your judgements. It's pretty clear I am TA. I still would like to provide some info, as my hr meeting already passed. I forgot to mention some things in the heat of the moment.  1. There is a general consensus in our break room to not heat up fish and to not eat stinky stuff. I don't know why this apparently doesn't appeal to my coworker and he had never gotten introuble because of that.  2. I have absolutely no problems with this coworker. Yes, I should have been much more sensitive and ask nicely, I did ask him once before if he could refrigerate his tuna so the smell wouldn't be overpowering. It was still an assshole move to do infront of my coworkers. I should have asked him again privately. And of course, my sensitivity to smell is not his problem. I just snapped. I did apologize to him.  3. We only have the break room. I cant go anywhere else, cause this is my part time airport job. We are not allowed to eat on the ramp or in the plane, even if it's empty. The break room is inside the security area, because that is where I had to work today. Nowhere else to go. Literally.  4. HR did dismiss the complaint my coworker made. I apologized to him and explained everything to him and that I snapped. He said my pregnancy was not his problem, HR said he shouldn't have eaten tuna in the break room doesn't matter if I am pregnant or not, many people did complain apparently directly with HR.  Again, thank you for your judgement. I did apologize to my coworker, he still kinda seems off but there is nothing I can do about that now.",

        "selftext": "My mother in law (Jane - 59F) came to pay us a visit a couple of days ago. We couldn't make it to their house for Christmas, and she decided to spend a few days with us to catch up. For the context, I (34F) take calls quite often. A day when I'm on call includes my phone ringing at a pretty late hour and me having long conversations over the phone. I often have to just get dressed and leave. So it can be pretty loud. I don't want to disturb my wife (Bella - 33F) or our kids (3 and 5 year old girls) during their sleep. We've got ourselves a system. So for days when I'm on call, I'll go sleep in my reading room downstairs. (It's basically a room with my textbooks, journals, a desk and a bed). Our bedroom and the kids' rooms are upstairs. This way, I don't disturb anyone and I sometimes even catch up on some work. For the days she was with us, Jane was staying in a guest room close to my reading room downstairs. I was on call, and I answered the phone through the night as usual. I had to leave the house at around 3 AM.  The next day when I came home, Jane was very annoyed with me and said she had heard me through the whole night, had heard me talk and pace around the room like a mad woman and heard me get my car. She said she almost did not sleep at all. Bella tried to calm her down but she was really upset and said Bella herself couldn't take being near me which is why she banished me downstairs for these call days.  I apologized and said I was sorry. Jane insisted she wasn't sleeping anywhere near me during my call days ever again and called it a restless night. I said I would be on call for a few more days while she was staying with us and unless she had a plan, I would be sleeping downstiars.  I don't wish to change the current arrangement we have mostly because Bella is exhausted as is and I want her to get as much sleep as she can. Jane said maybe I just needed to be more present and support Bella more as her wife and the mother of our children.  Was I the ah?",

My partner is very family oriented, which is one of the traits that I fell in love with. However, he is also a momma's boy. He believes that since his parents raised him, he should pay them back by respecting them. However, his way of respecting them is by obeying everything that they say and want.  His parents and I have crossed paths over the years and on most of these occasions, his parents have made off handed comments about my physical appearance, my career, and how I have changed their son. When something goes wrong in their son's life, they are quick to blame me as the reason for his downfall even if I had no involvement in that aspect of his life.  Since my partner and I are seriously thinking about marriage, we have been meeting up with his parents and my parents more often. During one of the dinners with his parents, my potential future MIL said she would be sad if I marry her son because she does not think her & I have a close relationship. I was in shock by her statement and did not respond back. After that moment of silence, she continued to ask me if I agreed that we did not have the best relationship. I think at this point, the inital shock was disappearing and I started to feel hurt by her words. In response to her question, I said that I don't think we have a close relationship because I often feel attacked by her. I then continued to list a few prime examples. As we discussed these examples, the conversation become more heated and turned into a full-blown argument. The last thing I remember saying to her was that if my partner and I ever broke up, it will be all her fault.  Now, she complains to her son about me all the time and refuses to speak to me. Her behaviour is causing some strain in my relationship. AITA for aruging with her? I come from a cultural background where respecting your elders is pretty much the goldren rule. ",

In all honesty I wasn't a perfect dad, I'm a former drug addict (clean for 4 years now) which was the reason for our divorce. However, I've always done my best for my daughter, supporting as much as I could both financially and emotionally. I love her very much but she makes things soooo difficult for me My fiance (39f) and I have been together for two years and we're planning to get married this summer. My fiance is a really lovely and kind person, she tried very hard to be good with my daughter, but she never liked her. She was rude to her many times and when she finally insulted my fiance (she started the argument, and my fiance didn't even raise her tone), my fiance stopped trying. Since then (6 months) I've never brought them together When I mentioned our wedding plans to my daughter, I also told her that she wasn't invited (my fiance didn't ask me to, it's my own call) because I think she'll make a scene there. We had an argument, and now she's mad at me. I also talked to my ex-wife and she also disapproves of her behavior, but she thinks I still should invite her. My daughter doesn't want me to be with my fiance at all, but she has no rational reason. I don't want to upset her, I've already disappointed her enough when I was an addict, but I want to live my life in peace. I'm still not sure about my decision AITA? Edit: First, I want to make it clear that I'm not saying that I'm a perfect dad, I'm saying that I'm doing the best I can because I really am, and I'm aware that it's not enough. I'm not disconnected from reality as some of you imply. I'm aware of the damage I've done to my daughter, and believe me, I'm trying very hard to make amends. I also realized that I was very judgmental towards my daughter. I will apologize to her and invite her to the wedding, but before that I will also offer to go to therapy together.

We have had to be running some tests at the hospital to check for a condition, everything is being coordinated by the neurooncologist. She referred us to an orthopedist, who then asked for a blood test, additional to other blood tests that were being done to him as requested by the neurooncologist. When we mention to the neurooncologist the order for the blood test from the orthopedist, she took the original and said that, since they had to take my son's vein in order to sedate him for an MRI, they could use that to already take the blood for the test that the orthopedist asked for. Up to here, all is well, except for the fact that taking the vein for my son was particularly difficult, he was resisting and it was especially hard to handle for him (and for us as parents as well). Fast forward about a week and I call the neurooncologist on the phone to see if the results from the test had come in, in order to make the appointment with the orthopedist already. To this she answers that now she remembers that she took the order, but lost it, so the test wasn't made. Then she tries to tell me that I also didn't remind her of the fact this test had to be done (to which I replied that it is not my job to keep track of the tests that are being done to him, assuming everything is coordinated by her and trusting she keeps everything on file). My wife then is overhearing this conversation, which makes her extremely angry, and keeps asking me to let her take the phone, so she can speak to the neurooncologist. I refused to let her take over the call because I was a) already taking care of it in the way I considered it should be handled and b) It seemed to me my wife wanted to go nuclear in telling the neurooncologist how big of a fuckup this was, how incompetent she is, etc, etc. I honestly believe that her talking to the neurooncologist would have done nothing to improve the situation, other than maybe bringing her some outlet to vent her anger. It's been about a week since this happened and we just had a fight about it, because we not only disagree on how things were handled on our end, but my wife feels I betrayed her as a partner and co-parent. So AITA for not letting her talk to the neurooncologist? If I am, and I am missing something, I will not hesitate to apologize. But I honestly can't see that what I did was wrong.

After Amber trying multiple times and finally reaching Kate, she came down to the ER. She took a look at the X-ray, talked to the ER doctor, and without letting even the slightest bit of emotion or compassion toward her crying daughter and wife, said it was just a small fracture, that it didn't extend to the joint and would be okay in a few weeks' time with just casting.  The only compassionate thing she did was holding Amber when they got Chloe's little arm into a cast. I got really mad at Kate and said she was downplaying her daughter's broken arm and acting as if nothing was wrong! She simply said kids get injuries like this a lot and there was nothing extraordinary going on here.  I may be TA here because I called her an ice cold insensitive mother.

        "selftext": "Last week, myself and 4 of my children moved into a 4 bedroom house. As there is 5 of us and only 4 bedrooms my teenaged sons are sharing a bedroom. They are 17 and 13. Myself, my 12 year old daughter, and 27 year old autistic son have our own rooms. They boys have shared a bedroom all their life, until last summer when my 22 year old daughter moved out and one of them took her room. Now that we've downsized, they're unhappy about sharing a room again.  The house has two bedrooms and a bathroom upstairs. One of the bedrooms is tiny and is my daughter's room and the other is mine so we can share the same bathroom.  There is also two bedrooms and a bathroom downstairs. One is around the same size as my bedroom and the other is around 5 feet wider. The smaller bedroom is still a decent size with enough room for two double beds and the rest of their furniture. In the end I decided to give my teens the smaller bedroom for a few reasons.  1. My 17 year old is a senior in high school and will be going to college in the fall, at which point my 13 year old will have the room mostly to himself other than school breaks.2. My 27 year old has a part-time job and pays me $150 in rent a month.3. My 27 year old also spends more time at home/in his room than his younger brothers. I'm planning on getting him a couch and his own tv set up so he can have his own living space in the room. My teens are very active and have never spent a lot of time hanging out in their rooms even when they each had their own.4. Although my 13 year old doesn't see his dad, my 17 year old does. He has his own room at his dad's house and although he spends more time at my home he still stays with his dad somewhat frequently. Despite all the reasons I've listed, the teens have expressed that they are unhappy that they have been given the smaller room. They think as there is two of them, they should have gotten the bigger bedroom. My 13 year old is the most annoyed of the two and was texting his older sister complaining. She talked to me about it and took their side and suggested it seems like I'm playing favorites by giving their older brother the bigger room.  I understand with their argument, but also don't think a few extra feet of space is going to heal their frustration of sharing a room again. I willing to listen to criticism about this and possibly change things around. Am I being the asshole and should I switch their rooms before my older son gets too settled?",

        "selftext": "We went on a family cruise that has become a yearly tradition. The only difference is my son, who is 18 years old, wanted to bring his girlfriend (Morgan) this time and we said it sounded like a great idea. We paid for her trip and everything she\u2019ll need, and it was pretty costly. Because of this we couldn\u2019t pay for our niece, 16. Her parents don\u2019t have much expendable money, they are pretty poor, and she was unable to come to this trip. We promised we\u2019d go on another cruise during Summer and pay for her to come. I felt bad we couldn\u2019t bring her, but we wanted our sons gf to feel welcomed. Well, she has been a little difficult. I had met her before and thought she was a lovely girl, but I got a completely different interpretation of her this trip. When she first saw her room, she said she was expecting more and it seemed small. That really rubbed me wrong, but I ignored it. My son told me she came from a wealthy family. My kids were sad their cousin wasn\u2019t here, but I told them to spend time with Morgan. Unfortunately, they\u2019ve been getting into fights. Morgan yelled at my kids because they used an handicap elevator, specifically designed for disabled people. She said it was rude and entitled. My kids pointed out that they got lost and had no idea where they were. They found the elevator and decided to take it up. They said no disabled people were using the elevator but if they were they would have given it up immediately. But Morgan said it was really entitled and shitty of them. I\u2019m not sure I understand her logic here. It seems like she\u2019s starting fights over nothing and I\u2019m confused by she\u2019s parenting my kids. She\u2019s been getting into multiple fights with my daughters, who are exhausted of her. I overheard them talking about how awful she is at a dinner and approached them to tell them to shut up. People can hear them, and we don\u2019t want Morgan to feel unwelcomed. They said they were tired of her. She was super entitled and still complaining that we didn\u2019t spend money on a better cruise or better things to do. (Unbelievable because this was cruise was around 2k each person.) They said I was an asshole for leaving their cousin at home and inviting this entitled person instead. They said their cousin should be here, not this lady. I told them we need to show support to their brothers relationship, someone that could be apart of the family one day. I\u2019m sad to leave my niece home too. AITA here?",

        "selftext": "I\u2019m (M43) a single dad to two twin daughters (F18), Jess and Amy (not their real names). Their mum hasn\u2019t been in their lives since they were about 6 and as a result, we\u2019re a close family and the girls have an extremely tight bond. They couldn\u2019t be any different as people though. Jess is a big extrovert; she loves to party, is out every weekend, has a boyfriend and a big circle of friend. Amy, on the other hand, is introverted, shy, and spends most of her time studying or reading. They still remain really close and I hope that Jess brings Amy out of her shell more and Amy encourages Jess to study more than she currently does. Last weekend, Jess had been invited to a party with a group of friends. Amy hadn\u2019t been and I suggested to Jess letting Amy come as well; I thought it would be good for her to socialise after working hard throughout the week. Jess mentioned it to Amy and when Amy asked me, I told her she should go. They both got ready that evening, Jess picked out Amy\u2019s outfit, and it was great to see some sisterly bonding. At around 2am, I hear a big thud downstairs which woke me up. Jess was carrying Amy, who was clearly very, very drunk. When I asked what happened, Jess told me that Amy had gotten carried away drinking and as she\u2019s not used to alcohol at all, it had a bad effect on her. Jess told me Amy was talking to everyone, flirting with boys, took her top off to expose her bra, drinking shots, and essentially nothing like her character. Jess took her away at 2am to come home. While Amy was vomiting in the toilet, I got annoyed at Jess for allowing her to get in that state as she knows Amy doesn\u2019t drink and Jess had a responsibility to look out for her when she\u2019s on her own. Jess said Amy\u2019s an adult and she can do what she likes, which got me extremely irate and I shouted at Jess as I knew Amy would not have been in that state if Jess wasn\u2019t encouraging her to drink/party. Amy has been extremely embarrassed (as well as hungover) since and has said she\u2019s never planning to socialise with Jess or at school again. I\u2019ve told Jess I\u2019m disappointed in her for allowing this, which she said is completely unfair. Now she\u2019s being distant with both me and Amy. Part of me feels this is justified as I know Jess would have had an influence on Amy, while the other part of me does know she\u2019s an adult who should make her own choices. So, AITA? (Note that we\u2019re in the UK where the legal drinking age is 18).",

We got out of there when I was 18 and she was 10, and I took care of her until she was able to go to college (she is now in graduate school, doing very well for herself). Basically, I\u2019m not the most well-organized guy. I mean of course I take my job seriously (I work as a paramedic, and I aspire to go to med school soon, and I am responsible for peoples\u2019 safety), but my primary motivation is making a living and breaking the cycle. I don\u2019t put too much effort into things like looking presentable, or cleaning around the house or whatever. I\u2019m too busy for that. So I admit that while my little sister was growing up, she was more often than not the one who washed the dishes and cleaned the floors. Even nowadays, she spends her money on nice clothes for me and whenever she visits my apartment, she scolds me as if I\u2019m a little kid and she cleans up the mess. It\u2019s kind of amusing. So last weekend, my sister visited me, and once again, she rolled up her sleeves and started tidying up the place a little bit while we were chatting. While she was doing that, I jokingly told her that she would make a great housewife, and that she should aim to find a job like a flight attendant or something where she could put her neat-freak talents to use. My sister was sort of embarrassed when I said this, and her face turned red. She went on this whole rant about how this wasn\u2019t what she was going to grad school for, and then she entered my bedroom and freaked out when she saw the new clothes she bought for me, just laid out all messy on the floor. It was enough that she even started crying! She was so exasperated, and all she could say was you're supposed to be an adult. AITA?",

        "selftext": "I (30F) got engaged to Jack (31M) last year.From the start, wedding planning was a nightmare. We were excited to celebrate and begin venue searching, but Jack broke his knee and couldn\u2019t walk for months. During Jack\u2019s recovery, his brother Paul got engaged to Eva. Immediately, the family\u2019s attention shifted. Paul and Eva got an engagement party, they got to tour venues, go dress shopping; we were just...the other ones. By the time Jack recovered, we realized that not only did we not want to compete with Paul and Eva, but that a traditional wedding wasn\u2019t in our budget. It would be cheaper to elope in Greece with close friends and family, then honeymoon there. Happy with our decision, we told the family in May that we would get married in Greece in December. Everyone was excited--for exactly six days, until Paul and Eva shared their date: one month before ours. It felt intentional. Paul has a thing about being the eldest and married first. And surprise, everything then turned to them. Band or DJ? White or beige linens? Who will be the flower girl? Everyone only cared about Paul and Eva\u2019s big wedding, not me and Jack\u2019s. It felt like everything was going wrong. Only one member of the bridal party (Taylor) said she\u2019d go to Greece. Even my mom wouldn\u2019t come. Paul and Eva were determined to upstage us, nobody cared about our wedding, even the bachelorette party sucked (but that\u2019s another story.) So, Jack and I decided in July to do a private courthouse ceremony\u2014something just for us instead of everyone else. Jack and I still eloped in Greece alone (see **EDIT** below.) It was perfect, and we had a little of our budget left, so decided to throw a small reception for friends/family back in the US when we returned. There, we shared our secret: that Jack and I actually married in July. People FREAKED OUT. Eva blurted, \u201cwhat was the point of Greece?\u201d and fumed the rest of the night. Our friends were quiet and kept to themselves. Taylor left early for an emergency. Even my mom left early. Later, Taylor called and said she felt \u201churt\u201d she wasn\u2019t \u201cincluded in the real wedding.\u201d She *was* included; she found out about our real wedding when my own family did. She was invited to the reception and the bach, the two most intimate and expensive celebrations of my life. She used a lot of therapy-talk, like \u201cyour day isn\u2019t about me, I just wanted to be a part of it. But nobody else complained, including my family, who are more important to me than anything. if they didn't feel excluded, why should she? My coworker thinks IATA. She said people traveled for our reception on late notice just to be told they weren't important enough for the real wedding. But nobody cared about our wedding, they just felt entitled to it after the fact. **ETA**: There were 3 events: 1) courthouse (July, just us), 2) ceremony/honeymoon in Greece (Dec, just us), and 3) reception in US with family in Jan. We unfortunately had to uninvite my in-laws and Taylor from Greece after my mom couldn't attend.",

        "selftext": "My husband 40 male was recently asked by his 52 year-old female boss if she could take him out for lunch at Hell\u2018s kitchen. I admittedly was a little upset to hear that he had taken her up on this offer because him and I always planned to go to Hell\u2019s kitchen together. We watch the show together. We\u2019re both fans of Gordon Ramsay and we always talked about going together for the first time one day. The only issue was money saving up for it, but she can afford it easily. His boss lost her husband unexpectedly a few years ago and has one son who she doesn\u2019t get along with. She is very attractive for her age and seems to really favor my husband. Am I the asshole for getting upset with him for accepting this offer, or am I being jealous and dramatic? We\u2019ve been arguing about it for a couple of days now.  Edit to add: thanks for all the responses. I\u2019m 4 years younger than him and in the same field of work. Some additional info\u2026 it is not a work lunch, it is just because and she asked him because she knows he just really wants to go. It is not during business hours it\u2019s on their own time. She\u2019s bringing him to show her appreciation for doing a great job at work. There is no promotion on the line, he\u2019s capped out basically. After reading all the comments I have to say I am definitely more disappointed about the fact my husband and I had planned to experience it together for the first time when we had extra funds. I cannot go as I will be out of town that day with family. However, I was also not invited to begin with. She is paying for the whole meal out of her own pocket. And I will admit that yes, I am weary and a bit jealous of the whole situation. My husband has decided he is definitely going. He has always been faithful that I know of\u2026 so it\u2019s more hurtful that we were suppose to go experience it together. ",

It\u2019s small, but it\u2019s mine, and I wanted to celebrate with a nice family dinner. I decided to make homemade spaghetti carbonara. I spent hours on it: crisped pancetta, freshly grated Parmesan, whisked with eggs and pasta water for a perfect, silky sauce. Carbonara is all about timing and texture, so I was in the kitchen paying close attention to every step. I added garlic bread, salad, and even made a cheesecake for dessert. It was a big effort, and I wanted the evening to feel special. Now, I keep a big jar of jellybeans on my coffee table as a treat. I love picking out a few here and there, and I always save the Cream Soda ones for last\u2014they\u2019re my favorite. The jar has lasted a long time, and it\u2019s something I enjoy after a long day. My sister Laura (35F) brought her 7-year-old son, who\u2019s honestly a bit of a handful. He\u2019s not used to hearing \u201cno\u201d and thinks every space is his to do what he wants. My sister has never set limits with him, and growing up, our parents spoiled her too. While I was busy in the kitchen, my nephew found the jellybean jar. I didn\u2019t notice at first because I was trying to get the carbonara just right. After dinner, I went to grab a handful of jellybeans and realized that almost all the Cream Soda ones were gone. My nephew had picked them out, leaving a mess of crumbs and broken bits. I pulled Laura aside and mentioned it, asking if she\u2019d noticed. She just shrugged and said, \u201cOh, he only likes the Cream Soda ones, so he picked those out. No big deal.\u201d I tried to be polite, but I told her that those were my favorites and asked if she could replace them, or at least get me some more of the Cream Soda flavor. She got annoyed and snapped, \u201cHe\u2019s just a kid. You\u2019re seriously this worked up over some jellybeans?\u201d I told her it wasn\u2019t about the jellybeans, but that it would\u2019ve been nice if she\u2019d kept an eye on him or taught him to ask. Laura rolled her eyes and said, \u201cThen don\u2019t leave temptations out if you don\u2019t want kids touching them.\u201d I asked her one more time to either replace the jar or just the Cream Soda ones, but she refused, calling me \u201cpetty\u201d and saying I was blowing things out of proportion. My parents jumped in to back her up, telling me to \u201cdrop it\u201d and that I should \u201cknow better than to have temptations out around kids.\u201d But it\u2019s not just about the money\u2014it\u2019s about respect and boundaries. I put a lot into that dinner, and her response was to let her son treat my place like his personal candy store. Now my family thinks I\u2019m overreacting, but to me, this is about respecting boundaries. AITA for asking my sister to replace the Cream Soda jellybeans her son ate? Edit: I\u2019ll accept my verdict since apparently it is normal these days to allow a child to root through a jar of jellybeans like a hog looking for truffles. What I won\u2019t accept, what I won\u2019t tolerate, is the insults about my competency as a home chef. Let me walk you through it, so you understand why real carbonara takes time and why cutting corners would be a disgrace. First, I went to this authentic Italian market with shelves stacked high with imported goods, where the scent of cured meats fills the air. They carry real pancetta, flown in weekly, and I spent ages with the owner, Domenico, who handpicked the perfect wedge of Parmigiano-Reggiano for me\u2014a rich, nutty block that was almost too beautiful to grate. Next, I stopped at this tiny, family-owned shop that specializes in fresh farm eggs and produce. Carla, the owner, gets these eggs from a nearby farm, and each one is an intense, deep golden color, perfect for a creamy, rich sauce.  Finally, I swung by a Salumeria for semolina flour. It sounds dramatic, but that\u2019s the lengths I go for traditional pasta. The place feels like a rustic old-world bakery, with walls lined in wooden shelves and burlap sacks stacked high. Their semolina flour has a texture and richness that just doesn\u2019t compare\u2014ideal for handmade pasta that holds up with the perfect al dente bite. Back home, I crafted the pasta from scratch. Flour piled on the counter, eggs nestled into a well, kneading it with care until the dough was soft and elastic, a process that took a solid 15 minutes of arm work. Then, I let the dough rest before rolling it into long ribbons, each one dusted lightly with flour, like fresh snow. Finally, I crisped the pancetta, grated the cheese by hand, and whisked the eggs to the perfect consistency. The sauce had to be watched like a hawk\u2014just enough heat to turn it creamy without scrambling, with careful additions of pasta water to reach that glossy, silken texture. So yes, it took hours. And I\u2019m not ashamed to say that.",

        "selftext": "Quick details. Daughter (16) is a junior in high school. She has excelled her entire life at volleyball and plays on a prestigious club team in our area. She is currently being scouted by division 1 universities.  2 weeks ago, her highschool had prom. She went, even though I thought she shouldn\u2019t. She had an out of state tournament that she skipped to go to prom. Other girls on the team skipped their school\u2019s prom for this tournament. I told her what I thought she should do, but I allowed her to make her own decision and wasn\u2019t going to interfere.  She had another tournament this past weekend where, unsurprisingly, she barely played. She normally starts and plays most games but she sat on the bench most of the time for this tournament. She told me that she thinks this is unfair, and she is being benched because she went to prom. She wants me to talk to the coach about her decision and make sure it doesn\u2019t happen again.  I told her what I felt. I flat out told her no I would not talk to her coach. I told her that she is part of a team, and had a commitment to them and she decided to be selfish and go to a silly dance. She argued with me saying how this is a special occurrence. I reminded her 2 things. 1) That other girls on the team prioritized the tournament over their proms. And 2) she\u2019s lucky to be as talented as she is, and she will most likely not pay for college. This is an opportunity all those prom goers would probably love to have. I warned her this would happen, and she decided not to listen to me.  She is still upset with me; I told her I hope she learned something about being part of a team. My husband thinks I am wrong because prom is important to a teenager and thinks the coach is being unfair. But I have 0 issue with what the coach did. ",

I work as a dentist, but i really dislike talking about work outside of work. so i told them it was nothing interesting. and the convo was moving forward. but one of the guys kept on asking and was so curious for god knows why, and jokingly said\u201dare u embarrased cos you work at McDonald\u2019s\u201dhe was starting to annoy me, so I said in a dead serious tone that I do in fact work at McDonald\u2019s and that\u2019s why I didn\u2019t want to talk about it and tried to make it as awkward as possible. i thought it was hilarious, seeing his \u201coh sorry bro\u201d face while the other 2 tried not to laugh  BUT like a week later, I kinda forgot about it, and my wife came home and started yelling at me about why I lied to her colleagues. apparantly rumours spread fast in her workplace and eventually the whole office was judging my wife behind her back until she eventually found out. I honestly do get why she was pissed, and it was a back and forth for awhile until eventually she said what if she came into the clinic I work at and told everyone she was a prostitue. I thought about it and you know I kinda see her point.But at the same time I feel like she\u2019s just easily embarrassed and was just angry in the moment for getting judged by the office. however she thinks I was childish and immature and did not need to do that.

        "selftext": "For some context my husband Peter (33 m) and I (31 f) have been married for five years. He is from Ukraine while I am Canadian, but we both currently live in Latvia. We have two kids together, Buck (4 m) and our newborn daughter Lina (3 weeks f). Since I have given birth to Lina I have had severe postpartum depression. When I had Buck it was the same, but I thought it would get easier since this is my second birth. A few days ago my family showed up on my doorstep. There were my three brothers, my mom, my dad, and my auntie. I was very surprised since I live in Latvia and they live all the way in Canada. I invited them in and asked why they were here. They told me that they planned this trip as soon as they found out what day my due date was. They said that they knew how bad the last pregnancy was (it was a high risk c-section) so they wanted to visit and help me to settle in with my new baby. I asked to talk to my mother in another room. I told her how I was going through some pretty bad postpartum and I didn\u2019t know if I was ready for people over. She apologized for just showing up, and told me that she also thought that my postpartum wouldn\u2019t be as bad this time. I found out that their trip was only two nights long. I thought that I could do it, so I told her that everything was fine. We went back into the room with the rest of my family. I explained that I was having very bad postpartum. I said how I would try my best to let them be with the baby but I couldn\u2019t make any promises. Soon Peter got home from work with Buck. Lina started crying so I went to the nursery to bring her downstairs with me. People instantly were all over me and Lina, trying to get a look at her. I was very overwhelmed but Peter helped keep everyone a few feet away from me. Everyone wanted to hold her, but I told them that after dinner I might let them. I made up a lie saying that Lina doesn\u2019t really like new people. We ate take out for dinner and I found out that my family were going to a hotel to sleep. The rest of the night went smoothly along with most of the next day. I even let my mom and auntie hold Lina. Things started to get bad when my youngest brother asked to hold her but I told him that I didn\u2019t feel comfortable with that. He then started to get angry, calling me over protective and rude. He said how he just wanted to hold his first niece. My two other brothers have kids too, but they only have boys. I told him that saying that wouldn\u2019t make me any more comfortable, and if he wanted to hold her then he would either have to wait until I was ready or until the next time that they visited. The room got tense as my brother and I stared at each other. He ended up leaving with most of my family. Only my mom and auntie stayed behind. This all happened two days ago. Everybody left my house yesterday. Now my family is split. One side says that I shouldn\u2019t have been so harsh while the other agrees with me. So AITA? ",

        "selftext": "My friend and I are both 27F and have been friends since we were 8 y/o. I got married this past April and she was a bridesmaid in the wedding. About 9 months out from the wedding I learn from my MOH that because this friend doesn't want to pay for a hotel room, she instead had texted the entire bridal party (excluding me and the groom) about booking a large airbnb together with their s/o's. MOH said the group text indicated that this airbnb was for the bridal party but not the bride and groom. This airbnb plan ultimately fizzled out, but I texted my friend/bridesmaid to just to talk with her about how it bothered me that she was trying to make new plans for my wedding party for my wedding weekend without saying anything to me or my now husband. She was very defensive and told me it wasn't a big deal, and dismissed my feelings entirely. The conversation ended and we just didn't have a reason to talk for a while.  Fast forward to my bachelorette weekend, and lots of wine, and she made some comment about the lodging for my wedding weekend and I snapped at her in front of everyone. I told her that she was selfish and only cared about what she wanted. Later that night we tried to hash things out and I apologized for snapping at her but tried to explain that I did think she was selfish for trying to change my wedding plans without telling me and then also dismissing me when I tried to talk with her about it. I told her it hurt my feelings that as a friend of almost 20 yrs she could care so little about my intentions and opinions of my wedding. When I said she wouldn't appreciate it if the roles were reversed, she told me that she really couldn't entertain that hypothetical bc she wasn't seeing anyone. We smoothed over the conversation that evening but I'm not totally sure that either of us saw the other person's side. Then leading up to the wedding everything seemed normal again with us and she was enthusiastic about the wedding and left me a thoughtful card on the day of.  Now that the wedding is over she doesn't speak to me, she didn't tell me she was coming to town multiple times, or that she's moving to the area that I live in. Come to find out she told another friend that she was just getting through the wedding and had planned to stop talking to me after.  AITAH for telling her that was selfish?",

I don't know the specifics but when he came home, he wasn't cleared for work or driving by his doctors and his case was still being reviewed for monthly compensation. My husband didn't want him to dip into his savings just yet so he walked dogs, babysat, and did similar odd jobs to get some money to pitch in with gas and groceries here and there when he could. We discussed it with Andy that whenever he did start getting a stable income he would have to start paying rent and helping with bills. Andy agreed. Andy had his case settled and received a back payment for the time he was discharged to current time.  Upon learning that, I gave Andy a list of expenses for the time we supported him, namely rent for the 15 months and a portion of utilities. It came out to roughly 7k. Andy told me I was more or less an asshole for keeping a running tab of everything while he was at his lowest, but he paid me the money right away. However, he told my husband that he'd be finding someplace else to live and started packing everything up and had a friend take him to put his things in storage. My husband is furious and said I should've talked to him before deciding to charge his son back rent in his house. I told him I live here too and contribute to the finances and that Andy is an adult, not a child or someone just turned 18, he's practically a tenant. 465 a month was better than Andy would find anywhere else. My husband said it's not about the amount, but nickel and diming Andy like that was just scummy. AITA?",

We had a very rocky marriage, during which I was a stay-at-home mom, and I struggled a lot financially afterwards. Because of this, during our divorce, my ex-husband and I agreed that our daughter would live mainly with him and I received alimony payments from him for about 4 years after our divorce. For the first several years after the divorce, my daughter would stay with me every other weekend and several holidays (the specific holidays depending on the year), and I always enjoyed our time together, but it would often feel like she didn\u2019t want to see me. She was never interested in any activities or occasions that I planned for us and normally when I called to talk to her, she would be busy with school, an extracurricular activity, or something else. Usually when she would spend the night with me, she\u2019d ask about the divorce and why her father and I aren't together anymore. I always tried to be as honest as possible with her but I could tell the divorce had been hard for her and when she started high school she stopped visiting altogether. She and I have been low contact for the past few years, and this past weekend we had an argument regarding her graduation. She\u2019s graduating from high school this June, and I texted her to ask about the details. She responded with a very passive aggressive text asking if I would actually come and how she didn\u2019t want to waste a ticket. I wasn\u2019t sure where it was coming from, so I called her and she started ranting about how I was never around, and that I always blamed her father for everything, and how I cared about my students more than her (I\u2019m a high school teacher). I interrupted her and told her that she knows nothing about what happened between her father and I. I told her that she made her choice to stop visiting and not to answer when I call her and that she couldn\u2019t blame anyone else for that and she hung up. About an hour later she sent me a long text about how much I hurt her and that she didn\u2019t want me at her graduation and that I \u201cneeded to change\u201d. Since that night, I\u2019ve gotten several messages from my ex-husband\u2019s family about how I\u2019m a terrible mother and how I should\u2019ve been more involved when my daughter was younger, and I\u2019m not sure how to handle this.

        "selftext": "I (35M) have a friend, Steve (48), who accidentally got Stephanie (44) pregnant about a decade ago, and they now have a daughter, Chloe (9). I met Steve last year at a park while walking my dog, and we became friends since he lives nearby and also has a dog. Steve\u2019s a good guy who cares deeply about his daughters (he has three adult daughters from another relationship). Whenever I\u2019m with Steve and Stephanie calls, she often seems ridiculous. Sometimes she calls over minor things; other times, she\u2019s frantic, like she\u2019s on the verge of a breakdown. She\u2019s a helicopter parent and very possessive of Chloe. Stephanie doesn\u2019t let Chloe visit Steve alone. The first time Steve ever took Chloe anywhere without her was recently\u2014and only because one of his adult daughters went with them to a movie. Steve said Stephanie blew up Chloe's phone the entire time. Steve wanted to teach Chloe to ski, but Stephanie told him it wasn\u2019t appropriate for a 9-year-old and that he needed to find a better activity. Every idea Steve has for activities gets shut down with an excuse. Despite this, Stephanie often makes passive-aggressive comments like, \u201cCome over here and be a dad,\u201d even though Steve gives her at least $250 a month (voluntarily, no court order) and spends multiple evenings a week at her place to be with Chloe as that's Stephanie's idea of visitation. She makes it seem like he isn't a good father or something when it is\u00a0**she**\u00a0that doesn't really let Chloe hang out with friends,\u00a0**she**\u00a0that bought Chloe a smartphone due to her incessant need to always be able to contact her,\u00a0**she**\u00a0who isolates Chloe from Steve's side of the family and\u00a0**she**\u00a0who is always worrying about making rent, yet only has a part-time job and spends money that should be going towards other things on weed. When Steve brought up to Stephanie that he thought that 9 is way too young to have a smartphone, his concerns were all ignored. When he brought up that he doesn't like Chloe being around her when she is smoking weed due to secondhand smoke, the issue was disregarded. Recently, Stephanie moved, and I helped Steve while she mostly stood around watching. Her place looked like it was recently featured on *Hoarders*. That day, Stephanie took Chloe to the ER for **the flu** as Urgentcare won't see her without insurance. Later, I told Steve about the Affordable Care Act and how he could get insurance for himself and Chloe. The next day, Steve asked Stephanie for Chloe\u2019s social security number to enroll her, and Stephanie freaked out, saying, I don't even give Chloe's SSN to the state! She claimed Chloe was already insured and when asked by Steve who the insurer was, she mumbled something vague. I directly asked, \u201cWho is she insured through then?\u201d and Stephanie snapped, yelling, \u201cWE ARE HER PARENTS!\u201d When we left, Steve said, \u201cSee what I\u2019m dealing with? How she snapped at you?\u201d I replied that she had a point\u2014it\u2019s not really my business. What do you think? Was I an asshole for asking who insures her child? EDIT: I wanted to add that I have already advised him to get an attorney. He mentioned once that his brother is in huge debt over attorney fees to get time with his own daughter. I let him know that many attorneys will work with you and let you pay in monthly installments and he was very receptive. I was going to include that in the original post but was limited to 3000 characters. Why he hasn't done this already? I don't know, I mean I certainly would have long ago. Also that about $250 is in addition to him paying a big portion of her rent every month. SECOND EDIT: Wanted to add that I agree that my buddy should have taken care of this sooner. He stopped smoking weed shortly after I met him and has gotten and new job and is getting his life together, but Stephanie has made not made it easy for him to be a good dad by alienating Chloe from him and his side of the family. Her need for control is so great that she won't allow Steve to spend time with the child alone, and she wouldn't give the SSN to Steve because she perceives it as getting one over on her. When Steve asked her for the SSN so he could insure Chloe at **no cost to her** she should be happy to oblige, not adversarial. She isn't working at co-parenting and **he clearly is.** As far as child support what more should he be doing? He already pays a big portion of the rent and whenever she calls him for money, he never says no or doesn't give her money when she asks so I'm not sure what more he should be doing. ",

        "selftext": "I\u2019ll keep this short. My boyfriend and I have been together for close to 2 years. I won\u2019t lie and say it\u2019s the the best relationship ever. We have our differences but I do love him and do want a family one day. He\u2019s 28 I\u2019m 25. So today is Easter and since my boyfriend is catholic (well culturally anyway) his family had a get together. I had met his family before and while I wouldn\u2019t say there is any ill will between them and me. They are just very different from me and my family and really anyone I\u2019ve ever grown up with. I\u2019ll just say to me it\u2019s odd to see a family gathering where people are openly smoking weed and all the guys are almost falling to the floor drunk. My family would never be that way. I\u2019m not judging I just grew up differently. But that\u2019s all besides the point. My boyfriend has a younger sister who is I believe 19 or 20. And I suspect she is on the spectrum. I actually enjoy talking to her she\u2019s funny and smart and witty. She is basically forced to be at these family events even though I know she doesn\u2019t enjoy being there. She\u2019s also a picky eater and doesn\u2019t like vegetables or spicy food or anything too extreme. Unsurprisingly her family pressure her to eat whatever is available. My boyfriend today was being particularly obnoxious about it. He took her plate and ate her chicken and potatoes. Leaving her just the stuff she doesn\u2019t like. He said he was tired of her trying to be different and she needs to grow up and be normal. She started crying and it felt like everyone was just watching and no one did or said anything. A backyard full of adults and they all let this happen. So I finally snapped and yelled at him. I said wtf was his problem. To leave his sister alone and stop being an asshole. The entire family went silent. I felt so embarrassed in that moment. My boyfriend just stared at me for a second before walking over to the table his uncles and cousins were playing cards and they all just busted out laughing. No one talked to me for the rest of the day. I just spent my time with his sister. I was just shocked that her own parents would ignore all of this.  After about an hour or so I texted my boyfriend that I wanted to leave and he sent me a thumbs up emoji. So I left. I came home and told my roommates about it and they agreed it was messed up how things went down but also suggested that I may have made things awkward for the family. Does this make me an asshole?",

Every time that one of these guys comes over, our bathroom smells like a fishy sewer for days afterward. Every. Single. Time.  We keep re-caulking the toilet but it doesn't even matter because the next time he comes over, it's back. Both of these men are significantly heavier than us but one of them lived with us for the better part of a year and we never had this issue. Friend #2 must be doing something ~extra~ on the toilet that's causing this right??  My partner feels uncomfortable saying anything to him about it (understandably) but we are both disgusted even standing in our own bathroom. It feels dirty and nauseating and takes days for the smell to fade. WIBTA if I banned him from using our home bathroom? WIBTA if I put a sign up in the bathroom indirectly addressing the issue??  This all feels ridiculous for my own home bathroom but I'm at a loss LOL  ETA: We called the plumber today and they're coming next week to check it out. \ud83e\udee1  Also adding: This man does not smell otherwise so it's not a hygiene thing. We are not aware of any medical issue (doesn't mean it doesn't exist). And it's not clearly a poop smell or pee smell. It's distinct. We don't think he's wiping out the bathroom every time he comes over. ",

        "selftext": "Kayla and I (both 32 F) have been friends since elementary school. When she got engaged this Christmas she didn\u2019t ask me to be a bridesmaid because it was an automatic given. I love Kayla but the problem is that her wedding is taking place overseas and would cost more than I think is reasonable. Kayla\u2019s fianc\u00e9 is from a tiny, far-north Scandinavian town, it is where their wedding is happening. A couple weeks ago due to some family pressures they changed the date from Midsommar next year to Midsommar THIS year, about 4 months away. Between flights, the hotel (most everything in town has already been booked for Midsommar including every spare room and couch at his families home so the rooms at the final available stays are around $300 p/n for the 7 days of wedding events), the rental car, the bridesmaid dress, the full traditional outfit required to be worn for some the the events, pet boarding, as well as general incidentals and we are looking at a minimum $8000.  Kayla was very apologetic about the change when she announced it but has not acknowledged just how big of an impact this is. My husband and I have good jobs and are lucky that we don\u2019t have to worry about the day to day expenses of life, but we do still have to be thoughtful and save for any larger purchases or travel. For the last 4 years we have been saving for our tenth anniversary trip, a 3 week tour around Japan, and had just booked flights when the date change was announced. Kayla didn\u2019t know I had just booked flights and when she broke the news she actually said \u201cyou\u2019re so lucky, you\u2019ve been saving all that money for a vacation anyway!\u201d Here is where I might be the asshole. I also had a destination wedding. My husband and I got married in Alaska right out of college when most of our friends, including Kayla, didn\u2019t have particularly good or secure jobs. We know now this wasn\u2019t exactly fair of us but we split the rental of a big house with all our friends and flights to Alaska aren\u2019t anywhere near the $2k each it would cost us to fly to Kayla\u2019s wedding. I\u2019m scared that if I tell her the truth of why we can\u2019t go, it\u2019s too damn expensive, it will ruin our friendship. I could see why it would. She was a bridesmaid for me while far less financially secure than we are now and she knows we have a lot of money saved for travel. I fear she would question if our friendship is not worth cancelling our Japan plans and flights. Our friendship means a lot to me but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to plan a wedding this expensive to attend and expect me to cancel our dream trip to accommodate it. I don\u2019t want to risk it so my idea was to lie and say we have to do a major home repair (fixing the foundation maybe) that will cost all of what we have saved plus more, then when it did come time for the Asia trip say we were gifted the trip by my husbands parents. I know that there is a risk she would find out the truth and be even angrier, is that risk worth it to avoid telling her the truth?",

        "selftext": "My dad is quite overweight. We are the same height, but he weighs about 50 pounds more than me. He has large saggy breasts, a bulging potbelly, a very short neck, and a chubby face. I work out regularly and that's why I'm fit and in shape. Recently my dad has been more hostile toward me, repeatedly commenting on my appearance and diet. He said that I need to eat more (he eats a lot at meals and for snacks, whereas I eat a moderate portion), and he says that working out everyday is bad for my health. I just do 20 minutes of cardio and free weights mostly at home, but he says that too much exercising will ruin my body. He even scolds me when I occasionally skip a meal because I'm not that hungry. What he says has been getting on my nerves lately. Last night I was going to the basement to exercise, and my dad told me that I already exercised everyday for the past 6 days. I said that I like to workout daily, and he said that I am going to end up like my sister (18f), who developed an eating disorder in middle school and because of that is short and underweight up to this day (though she recovered around 9th grade). He said that for a long time she ate just 1 or 2 meals a day, and spends 2 to 3 hours exercising each day. (In fact I only skip a meal once in a while, and I exercise about 30 minutes per day). He kept saying that my behavior is unhealthy, and that I need to take a break from exercising and not obsess over my appearance I explained that I'm not obsessing over my appearance, but I just want to stay healthy and de-stress regularly, and maintain heart and lung strength. He still said that I am giving him flashbacks to when my sister had an eating disorder, and he said that he cannot repeat this mistake. He said that if his children have eating disorders, it reflects on his failures as a parent. I reiterated that I don't have body image issues, and that I just value physical fitness. He kept lecturing and criticizing me, and finally I told him that he might just be jealous of my appearance because of how much he has been commenting on it lately. I said that if he wants to be healthy he should eat less and exercise a few times a week, and that it's better to be fit than overweight or underweight. He got really angry and said that he cares about me and doesn't want me to have disordered eating or body image issues, and that it's a red flag that I exercise every single day. I said that I work out because I care about my health, not so much my appearance, and that if he was in shape he wouldn't have been so sore about it.",

        "selftext": "This just came up casually in conversation with my(37f) mother in law (68f). In reference to meeting her at the waterfront near our home, I was asking her to narrow it down a little when she said my wife (40f) could look for her location to make it easier.  Assuming she was mistaken, I said she would have to share location for that to work and she informed me that she and my wife have that set up 100% of the time. I laughed and said that\u2019s so unhealthy.  Got off the phone and asked my wife to confirm and she said yes, I asked \u201cDoes that mean the opposite is also true? Are you sharing  your location with her 100% of the time?\u201d She said yes,  I was being snarky cos I thought she would agree with me. I said something like \u201ccome on, you must think that\u2019s weird. Not even when you say it out loud?\u201d  Anyway, she\u2019s furious with me, says I\u2019m being mean, she\u2019s crying and left the house furious with me.  Am I the asshole here? I feel terrible about having blundered in and upset her , and will definitely apologise for the insensitivity as soon as we talk.  But please someone tell me - is the maps thing normal and I\u2019m the crazy one?  UPDATE: Wow, that was an absolute deluge of responses. Truly wasn\u2019t expecting it to have that much engagement. Posting to hopefully wrap things here because I really need to stop reading this for a while. Just going to address a couple of things quickly: 1. Thanks so much to the people that came here sincerely to give me a different perspective on the location sharing thing. My takeaway from lots of people giving their input is that the 24/7 sharing is a much more passive activity whereas I think my experience of using things like dropping a pin or sharing an Uber ride, I think my perception of it is like more of an active thing.  I get there is a range of perspectives and comfort levels on this and I clearly need to make a bit more space for that.  2. I\u2019M A WOMAN! \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 Despite me including it in the OP , lots of people did miss the fact that my wife and I are in a queer relationship. Really no offence taken, it\u2019s an easy mistake to make when reading through these quickly. Wanted to highlight it so that hopefully anyone who visits this subsequently doesn\u2019t get into a whole \u201cI don\u2019t get it because I\u2019m a man\u201d conversation.  3. I behaved in a shitty way to my wife. I thought I was clear on the fact that I knew I was the asshole for my response/attitude/how I said it but I obviously didn\u2019t do a great job of that. My focus was more on the location thing and I definitely saw that my take was definitely in the minority about location sharing.  4. Lots of people asked follow up questions about my wife and mother in law and people\u2019s health, back stories with lots of further questions about their relationship, my relationship with parents etc. I\u2019ve responded to questions about my own relationship with my mum a few places in the thread but I really get the ick at the prospect of adding more personal info about them.  5. Everyone saying: what if something happens? What if she gets in a car accident? What if *all the worst possible things? I\u2019d respectfully ask all of you to stop it. I\u2019ve gotten the point  you\u2019re making but please stop making me visualise the worst possible things happening to the best person I know.  6. Last but not least, I had already apologised on the phone when I posted this. When my wife came home I apologised again , in person, and she was gracious enough to accept my apology. A little later I told her about this post and told her the internet has decided that I suck and she\u2019s right so that gave us something else to giggle about it.  Thanks everyone xx",

        "selftext": "I (F35) just had an argument with my husband (M37) over this, but posting from an alt for anonymity. FYI, my entire job experience since I was 17 has been spent in male-dominated fields.  Think abnormally minuscule female to male ratios in almost every job I\u2019ve had since then. This is relevant later.  He was telling me about his day as a warehouse manager (normal, I enjoy hearing about his day). Apparently, over last week he interviewed and extended the offer to what will be the first female in his facility.  For some background, I will preface this by saying that he is a manager specifically to help the people who work under him. He\u2019s a fantastic dude, empathetic, feminist, caring, will go ten extra miles. I would recommend literally anyone work for him, even my own children if applicable. I have only the highest regard for him. Which is why this caught meSo off guard! He was telling me (obviously, I wasn\u2019t there, so all the info I have is what he said he told the potential hire in the interview) that \u201chis only concern with hiring her is that she would be coming into an all male environment, they will make off color jokes, they will give her grief at first for being new and being under the metrics then when she inevitably crushes them (she did better than any other applicant so far PERIOD on the physical/ability assessment) she would get shit for that too, some of the guys might try to pick her up, etc.  but that he was (and genuinely is!!) trying to change the culture.  If any of you are female and have worked in a male-dominated field, this is pretty much standard operating procedure. It\u2019s the same nearly everywhere I go and personally having someone tell me that it\u2019s their only hang up to hiring me would be mildly offensive. I didn\u2019t say this however, I just mentioned that he was mansplaining the environment to her. I intended to say maybe he should approach it from a position of \u201chey I know you\u2019re probably used to dealing with this, let me know asap if anyone crosses the line. We\u2019re working to change it!\u201d but he *immediately* jumped down my throat.  Apparently, to him calling him a \u201cmansplainer\u201d is on par with calling someone the N word. To me and the other women I\u2019ve talked to, mansplainers are just common; likely generally with good intentions, but will still try to tell you things you already know. In other words, a very gentle AH.  He said it\u2019s a slur and I crossed a huge line. I was using what I thought was a mild word for someone affably annoying that happens all the time. But I might be TA because maybe it registers high on the \u201chorribly offensive \u201c scale and I didn\u2019t realize it?  Also he said the actual conversation went very differently than the info he shared with me, which I makes sense as he\u2019s not usually that tone deaf. I was just trying to provide the female side of the story based on my own experience. AITA for using the term \u201cmansplain\u201d to describe what my husband told me he said to a female interviewee? Edit to address some things I saw in the comments (I promise I\u2019m reading them all, I just didn\u2019t expect so many!), sorry it was written at 3am right before I went to sleep so I missed some things: I haven\u2019t used this account in a LONG time, the husband referenced in past posts/comments is my ex (not because of gender issues). This is my current husband of about 1.5 years who is definitely male.  He is working VERY hard to change his warehouse\u2019s culture, but he\u2019s only been there 5 months and there\u2019s a myriad of things to fix; it all takes time. He is genuinely concerned about it though, which is why I even said something in the first place because I know he cares about making the woman feel welcome and heard. She currently works as one of 2 women in a warehouse of 90 (so she definitely knows what it\u2019s always like as well in that environment, and she said this to my husband as well).  HE is the one who compared \u201cmansplainer\u201d to the N word, not me. That\u2019s kind of the point of my post, to me it\u2019s an everyday adjective, not positive in nature but not a huge deal. To him, he said it was on par with calling a black person the n word. ",

        "selftext": "My (29F) daughter is five months old and goes to a daycare at my husband\u2019s (32M) workplace. My mother in law also works at the same place so she has easy access to the daycare. At least once a week she goes and spends 30 minutes to an hour just playing with my daughter. This rubs me the wrong way for so many reasons. As a mom, it frustrates me that she thinks it\u2019s okay to just drop by whenever without at least saying something or asking (I actually just found out while writing this that she tells my husband but nobody communicates it with me). As a former daycare worker, I would have hated having someone just come in and spend time with a child because now not only do they have infants to watch, but now they have to work around a fully grown woman and make sure that she isn\u2019t taking pictures/videos of other babies as well. I think my biggest issue is honestly that some days she gets to spend more awake time with my daughter than I do and I know that\u2019s a horrible reason to be frustrated with someone but it is what it is. Would I be the asshole if I asked her to stop visiting daycare so frequently? She comes to our house and gets to spend several hours with my daughter at least once a week so it\u2019s not like daycare is the only time she gets to see her.   ETA: Yes. I know I\u2019m the asshole for being jealous. After talking with my husband, I\u2019m realizing a lot of these feelings are based on big emotions from being exhausted and PPD. I don\u2019t hate my mother in law. This is my first and probably only child and she\u2019s my rainbow baby so I\u2019m very protective. For those of you that politely told me I\u2019m the asshole, thank you. For those of you that told me I need to see a therapist, already seeing one for my chronic depression and added postpartum depression so I\u2019m good. I\u2019m going to stop reading comments now and go snuggle with my baby that just got home. ",

        "selftext": "I, 38M, am the solo breadwinner of this house. I have a wife 35F and a daughter 5F. Me and my wife has been planning this family vacation to Venice for months. For context, my daughter is very little and she needs constant attention or she will get into trouble. Venice has always been my wife's idea of a romantic city, so it's been her dream to go there. However, we can't just leave our daughter at home. We initially wanted to leave her at my MIL's house, but she wanted to come with us and my MIL said that it was her dream to visit too. My wife was very supportive of this idea, but I was more reluctant. My wife planned everything, booking the hotels and the restaurants. However, to my dismay, she booked 1 rooms of 2 queens instead of two rooms with two kings. I planned for this to be a romantic getaway, and did not want my daughter in the room with us. We could easily afford two rooms, but my wife wanted to keep an eye on her as well. To make matters worse, my MIL was constantly in my space. She also had to share all of my wife's expensive products (facewash, shampoo, lotion, etc). My daughter likes to sit on our bed when me and my wife are gone to the city, and I come back to see that MIL was sitting on our bed too. It is very unhygienic to me and I don't like that she was sitting on the bed that me and my wife share, as I am a very private person. She also rummaged through our suitcase looking for a hair tie, and it really irked me that she did so without asking me. I don't like the thought of her looking through our stuff when we're gone, so I locked it. The final straw was when I woke up in the morning, I saw that MIL has yet again, forgotten something. For the last few days, she's been sharing the same toothpaste as me and my wife! I don't like the thought of her putting her tooth brush close to (or even on) the toothpaste nozzle and I was ill the more I thought about it. I asked MIL if the only reason she came was to freeload off of me and my wife, as she didn't pay for any of the expenses (hotel, amenities, food), only her own plane tickets. I said that I've asked her politely several times to stop using my wife's stuff, especially because I share it with her and it's very inappropriate. My MIL was very upset and told my wife, and my wife screamed at me. I was very angry that the trip that I paid with MY OWN MONEY was now ruined, and I changed the date of my plane ticket and went straight home. My wife has called me several times afterwards, screaming at me and saying that our daughter is upset. I feel bad that our daughter was caught in the situation, but it was really not acceptable what my MIL did and I had to set some boundaries before it gets worse. My wife has her own card and enough money to stay there. I'm not sure about her plans about staying or not. I've been ignoring her calls to take sometime for my own mental health. Edit: Thank you to everyone that responded. I'm reading through each response carefully and I have realized my mistakes. I'm taking tonight to write a sincere apology and I will be calling my wife first thing in the morning tomorrow. Thank you again. I love her more than anything and I want to make amends. FINAL UPDATE: I just called my wife to deliver my sincere apology. I am writing this with a heavy heart. She has blocked my number, and my MIL informed me that she will be looking into divorce proceedings. I have never thought about this happening, and I am at a loss of what to do. I have failed our family, as a husband and as a father. I am not angry at my wife for this decision, but I still cling to the hope that I can turn this around. I am about to lose the love of my life, over a stupid mistake that I made. I was not rational when I stormed off. She did not deserve any of my attitude. I am praying at this moment that after sometime off and after I change myself for the better, she will reconsider this divorce. I am going to contact a therapist and marriage counselling after posting this. I feel myself spiraling and I don't want to think how I ruined my life in the span of these 48 hours. Again, thank you to everyone that responded. I will be logging off for a while and work through my thoughts. I don't know what to say. I don't know what to do next.

        "selftext": "Okay. My boyfriend (27m) and I (26f) have been together about two years now but on and off since high school. We\u2019ve always felt like end game & end up together. But I love him and our baby (1m). This is my second baby. During our last off I was with my ex; who was so abusive to me that it gave me PTSD which my current bf knows a bit about. So I\u2019m protective over my kids. Always have been that way to be completely honest I\u2019m more of a reserved person. He is so trustworthy.  So a last night we went to a chain restaurant for his cousin (22m) birthday let\u2019s call him Cousin with most of his family so about 15 of us total. Now I need to give you context. Cousin has a girlfriend (21f) let\u2019s call her GF. Never met her. Heard of her twice in the two years maybe. But Cousin moved her down here from a different country. Now before yall get defensive in the comments we\u2019re the same ethnicity. Now Cousin goes to this country quite frequently. Don\u2019t know if this is the same girlfriend from last year. My boyfriend can\u2019t tell me cuz he doesn\u2019t even know.  Get to the restaurant get out the car say hi to Cousin & GF stands there outside our car my boyfriend is with our baby in his car seat. No hi no intro nothing immediately she goes for my baby. I say nothing (I\u2019m trying). My boyfriend had met her boyfriend once I believe since she\u2019s moved down here. My boyfriend hands over my baby. I say nothing. He\u2019s in a car seat that\u2019s fine with me.  I get in the restaurant. She\u2019s got my baby in her arms. Mom rage immediately activated. Any mom knows this. Why is a stranger I don\u2019t know touching my baby. I\u2019m already sketched out bout them carrying him in a car seat. We get in say hi to everyone my boyfriend knows I\u2019m upset he can see it. I say nothing. His grandma can see it and tells me to sit with her. I\u2019m quiet.  Couple minutes into the dinner I realize we don\u2019t have my sons bottle. I go to the car to  get it cuz I need air. I can\u2019t find it. I ask my boyfriend to help me find it. He comes out. Still sees I\u2019m upset asks a second time he keeps on asking as I tell him we can talk about it later. But he won\u2019t drop it so I tell him why I\u2019m upset. He proceeds to tell me how I\u2019m overreacting and I\u2019m the ONLY one with the problem. \u201cYou are  the only one that has a problem with her\u201d (I do start cry cuz im hormonal still it\u2019s not funny.) I can hear those words over and over in my head. We can\u2019t find the bottle. He goes inside leaving me outside alone teary eyed and upset. I call my mom to calm down. Ask if I\u2019m overthinking it and she reaffirmed me I was not. I text him I\u2019m going to the bathroom no response at this point in debating leaving with my son. But I can\u2019t cause a scene so I mediate a bit and go back. Finish the dinner and he acts like all is fine. We never talk about it again. It\u2019s the next morning but his words are engraved in my brain. He changed how I now look at him. He\u2019s LITERALLY DEFENDING A STRANGER INSTEAD OF ME. No apology. Am I the A**hole or overthinking?",

        "selftext": "My son (he\u2019s 8) has cerebral palsy. One thing we taught him is never to look down on himself. While we recognize he has limitations, and we make accommodations for him, we make sure he knows he\u2019s not defined by his disability and that his disability doesn\u2019t make him lesser than anyone else. As he grows older, we try to teach him to be more independent, as much as someone his age should be. He is 8 years old now. He\u2019s a smart kid and usually gets the highest grades in his class. He is liked by all his teachers and classmates and has more friends than I ever had. I\u2019m so proud of him. He is well-behaved both at home and at school. But lately, he has started acting strange. I think it all started around 1.5 weeks ago. He started avoiding all his responsibilities. He used to make his own bed with our help, but now he\u2019s refusing to do so. He stopped picking up his plates after dinner and started leaving his stuff around. I\u2019m afraid he might also stop doing his homework because for the last two nights, he didn\u2019t want to do it. Whenever I confront him, he straight up says, I can\u2019t, I\u2019m disabled, I have Cerebral Palsy. One time he even said, I can\u2019t, I\u2019m an R-word, and laughed. I was shocked. I told him not to use that word. I asked him if anyone told him that, and he said no. I told my wife, and we contacted his teachers, but he hasn\u2019t told them anything either and he\u2019s behaving well in school. Last night, he didn\u2019t pick up his plate after dinner again. I sat him down and told him to pick up his plate, and he screamed at me. He then again said he can\u2019t because he\u2019s disabled and useless. My wife immediately started to comfort him with \u201cno, you are not.\u201d I was frustrated with him acting out. This time, I decided to be more direct and strict. I scolded him, saying that he\u2019s only useless if he acts like he is. Then I said, \u201cNow stop using your disability as an excuse and pick up your plate.\u201d His eyes teared up, and my wife took him to his room. She thinks I\u2019m an AH for scolding him and raising my voice at him. I didn\u2019t even notice I raised my voice, but that\u2019s what she says. AITA? I should add that he has a rather mild case of Cerebral Palsy. He\u2019s not wheelchair-bound, though he needs crutches.",

        "selftext": "My (22M) girlfriend (23F) is a very artistic person who loves trying new things. Her most recent obsession is songwriting. About two months ago, a friend of hers got her to attend a beginner\u2019s workshop for it, and she\u2019s been hooked ever since. She\u2019s signed up for guitar and voice lessons, and writes whenever she has a moment of free time. When she finishes something, I\u2019m the first person she shows it to. I love seeing her so excited about something, and I\u2019m glad she feels comfortable enough to share her art with me. \r   She is, however, terrible at singing. Like truly awful. And to be fully honest, she\u2019s not that good at guitar either. But obviously I never wanted to tell her that. If she asked me how something sounded, I always said it was beautiful. I didn\u2019t think there was anything wrong with this kind of lie since it supported her and made her feel more confident. She disagrees.\r   To give some context as to how she found out I was lying: a few weeks ago, she asked me if it would be a good idea to start a TikTok page for her singing and songwriting. I could tell she was excited about it, but was nervous about putting her work on the internet. I told her she was crazy talented and should go for it. She lit up after I said this, and in the following days worked really hard to make videos of her original music. They didn\u2019t gain much traction, but she seemed to be having fun being a content creator, so I felt like I\u2019d made the right decision in encouraging her.\r   But yesterday, she walked into our bedroom sobbing and demanded to know why I\u2019d told her she could sing. I asked her what she meant, and she threw her phone down for me to look at. On it was one of her TikToks. It was one of those trends where you duet another musician by singing color-coded lyrics. Her video had been reposted to a \u201ccringe\u201d meme page and had blown up overnight. The comments were all horrible. Truthful, in some cases, but really mean about it. \r   She asked me again through tears why I\u2019d never told her she was bad. I told her she wasn\u2019t bad, people were just mean. \u201cIf hundreds of comments say I can\u2019t sing, then I can\u2019t sing,\u201d she snapped at me, \u201cso stop lying.\u201d \u201cOkay,\u201d I said. \u201cFine. You\u2019re definitely no Beyonce. You have a really unique sound though and I love that you share it.\u201d I thought she\u2019d feel encouraged by this, but it only made things worse. She started crying harder and insisted that the only reason she posted things in the first place was because I told her she was talented, and now she\u2019s been humiliated in front of thousands. She\u2019s deleted her TikTok account along with all her videos, and hasn\u2019t stopped crying or talked to me since. I feel like she\u2019s blowing this out of proportion; I was just trying to do a nice thing by supporting her, and it\u2019s not my fault the internet is what it is. I don\u2019t think I should\u2019ve done anything different, but since the internet put me in this position, I\u2019m curious if it will think I\u2019m in the wrong. AITA?\r",

It was so bad that he got kicked out of summer camp and went through multiple sitters all before he was 6. His mom and I worked so being a SAHP wasn't an option.  A few summers ago, we found our unicorn sitter- Mike. We have no idea Mike makes it work but he does. Caleb has been a different kid ever since Mike started working for us. He is so well-behaved, polite and social. Mike is like his best friend. We joke that Mike is Caleb's executive assistant. Earlier this year Caleb became friends with a classmate named Luke. They wanted a sleepover playdate and everything was good until we said that Mike would pick up both boys, bring them to my place, go to the pier and then back home to go to bed. Luke's mom flat out said she wasn't comfortable with a male sitter. I laughed because I thought she was joking. She wasn't. She said it was too weird for a male to babysit and wasn't cool with it. I said she didn't need to explain herself and there would be no playdates with our kids outside of school. She wasn't expecting that. I told her if she's not okay with a male caregiver then she probably wouldn't be okay with Luke spending the night at my place since I'm a single dad. I pointed out that she was the first parent to have a problem with this and Mike occasionally works for other families at the school. She was offended that I was offended. I ran into Luke's mom who said she needed a sitter for a couple of weeks as her old sitter quit and the new sitter wasn't free until mid-September. She then asked if Mike would be free. She even said she would need an overnight. I said you can't be serious. You said you didn't trust Mike and now you want him to watch your son so you can have a social life? I admit that it took guts to ask. I told her no, we will not share our nanny. You said that it was sus when a guy has a childcare job. She said she was joking and that Mike is a nice guy. I said I know he is but you can't use him. For the record, the days and times that she needed him are days where he is working for us. She would had paid him on top of what we pay but Mike would be at Luke's house or his place. My ex and I don't mind Mike double dipping on sitter fees by watching more than one kid because he can make a lot of money and Caleb gets a playdate.

        "selftext": "3 years ago my wife and I had our first child (the first baby in the family). My sister, always looked like she wasn't going to have kids, but did have her dog (a massive Labrador), in a big fan of the dog, but my wife understandably was a little nervous, and whilst she would tolerate the dog at family events pre-baby, when our child was born she didn't want the dog around our child.  Nothing was ever said to my sister, and she did visit us occasionally without the dog, but I think she cottoned on that there were family meet ups that she was no longer invited to as we didn't want the dog around our child.  Fast forward and now my sister has had a baby of her own. We want the cousins to grow up close but every time we offer to visit she says we have to leave our child behind because she doesn't want the toddler around her baby. Our child is too rough, and they might bring germs in from nursery. Just to be clear this baby is around the massive dog all day - so I don't think germs are really an issue!!!  It does feel like she is playing tit for tat, or am I just paranoid? I don't think we were wrong protecting our baby from her dog- so I am struggling now to see how she is taking the moral high ground! ",

        "selftext": " For context, I (19F) am from the United States and currently a second-year university student in the UK. My boyfriend (23M) is British, recently finished his master\u2019s, and is now working. We\u2019ve been dating for 10 months, and he\u2019s my first boyfriend. He\u2019s been nothing but understanding, kind, and supportive throughout our relationship. I\u2019ve met his parents and siblings twice, and both times were wonderful. His mom even told him she thinks I\u2019m \u201cthe one.\u201d In late November, he asked if I\u2019d like to spend Christmas with his family. He said everyone would love to have me there, and I thought it was sweet, but I declined. I\u2019ve been feeling homesick and wanted to spend Christmas, a holiday that means a lot to me, with my family in South Dakota. When I told him, he seemed aloof for a few days. I went to his flat later to reassure him that I\u2019d love to visit his family another time, but for me, Christmas is a family holiday. I now realize how that could\u2019ve sounded dismissive. He looked hurt and asked, \u201cDo you still love me?\u201d and \u201cAren\u2019t I your family?\u201d I reassured him that I do love him, and things seemed fine after that. About a week later, he surprised me by showing me a flight he\u2019d booked to South Dakota for Christmas. Flights to South Dakota are expensive, especially internationally, and while the gesture was touching, I thought it was impulsive and unwise. I told him it wasn\u2019t a good idea. For the first time, he got really upset, accusing me of not caring about him, not being serious about us, and thinking only of myself\u2014all of which are untrue. I love him and value our relationship deeply. Knowing he was speaking out of hurt, I asked him to take a walk to cool off. When he returned, I explained that he means everything to me, but I wasn\u2019t ready for him to meet my family. To be honest, I\u2019m nervous about how my family would react. I\u2019m white, he\u2019s Arab, and my family in rural South Dakota is not exposed to diversity. They\u2019ve made ignorant, racist comments in the past. While they\u2019d likely be polite to his face, I fear they might say something offensive or \u201cjokingly\u201d inappropriate. They also assume Arab = Muslim, even though he\u2019s Christian. This ignorance embarrasses me, and I don\u2019t want to put him in a situation where he might be hurt. I didn\u2019t tell him any of this, though. Instead, I said I felt it was too soon to \u201cbring someone home,\u201d as in my family, that\u2019s often a precursor to engagement (which is true). He asked if he wasn\u2019t \u201cgood enough,\u201d and I reassured him that he\u2019s perfect. He then mentioned that the tickets were non-refundable. I started crying, apologizing for wasting his money and saying how much I wanted him there, just not right now. He asked me to leave and said he needed space. I flew back home nearly a week ago, and since then, we\u2019ve only had brief phone conversations. He still texts me \u201cI love you\u201d and \u201cGood night,\u201d but he\u2019s clearly distant and hurt. I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s anything I can do to fix this or reassure him.

The garden is quite small, about 5m x 9m and I usually have the BBQ quite close to the house. My plan for this weekend was to smoke a brisket. I went out to start the BBQ at 8am for a 10 hour smoke when my neighbour asked from over the fence how long as I was planning on BBQing for, they mentioned that they wanted to have their windows open, that they'd just put some laundry out, and also said that our other neighbour had complained about the smell (this is the first I'm hearing of this). I asked if I could start later and we agreed on 2pm. Around 2:15pm I knocked at my neighbours door to let them know I was going to start cooking, that I'd reduce the cook time to 4 hours, and that I'd moved the BBQ to the back of the garden. Their response was to tell me that they had looked up on the council website that I was not allowed to BBQ for more than 4 hours, I just said okay and I've now started my cook. (I haven't been able to find anything to backup their claim there is a Council enforced 4 hour limit BBQ limit) I feel I've done my due diligence by letting them know I was starting and checking their laundry had been taken in, AITA for using my new BBQ?",

They've had a falling out today where one of Josh's middle school friends asked Colton why he still wears cartoon underwear and Colton asked why he was stupid. Josh told his friend to leave Colton alone because he was stilling elementary school (Colton is a 4th grader and Josh is a 6th grader). That hurt Colton's feelings and stormed out. His dad asked what happened and I told him what I knew. He said he didn't like his son coming home crying. I said I wouldn't either but maybe it's time for your son to play with kids in his grade. He then accused me of saying Josh was more sophisticated than Colton. I said there is very little that's sophisticated about a 12yo boy but of it's causing issues than it shouldn't be surprising. Later I found out that Josh texted Colton to say he was sorry his friend upset him and still wants to be friends. However, he's tired of it.

        "selftext": "I am upset and think my husband is being selfish right now. I 32F am married to Alex 30M. I am currently three months pregnant and this pregnancy has been really hard on me. In the past I have miscarried so we are keeping this pregnancy a secret until ~4 months and will not tell friends and family until then.  I have awful morning sickness that has let up in the past month, and as I can\u2019t tell anyone it has been hard, but Alex has really supported me in this time.  Alex\u2019s 30th birthday was Wednesday and I invited close family and friends over and got catering from his favourite restaurant. I can\u2019t cook huge volumes of food for guests or be up on my feet very long and made sure the party was short by throwing it on Sunday, so people would leave early for work the next day. The party for me was tiring and while I wanted to be there for Alex, I was glad when everyone left as I just wanted to go to bed. The morning after Alex said he has fun and I thought that was the end of it. For his actual birthday on Wednesday, I made him a cake and got him a birthday present. He seemed disappointed and when I asked why he asked me if this was it. I was confused and he said he assumed I was throwing him a big surprise birthday as I knew how much celebrating his 30th meant to him. I told him no his party was what happened on Sunday and that I have been too sick and tired to plan anything bigger. That party alone was a huge effort for me, especially coordinating what worked for everyone else, which happened to be the Sunday and worked out best for me. I got upset called him selfish and have avoided him ever since. He is upset as for my 30th he planned a big celebration and even invited my college friend from another country. I obviously appreciated his effort and that was the best birthday anyone has ever planned for me, but that\u2019s isn\u2019t possible for me to do for him with my pregnant and I told him we have different priorities now and he said that the baby wasn\u2019t even here yet. Alex has made in clear in the past he wanted to throw a big birthday for his 30th, but with my pregnancy and him seeing how it affects me day to day, I thought he would be more understanding of the effort I did make and be more aware of what is possible for his birthday.

We have no issues with this, we charge her a small amount of rent and she keeps the house clean. She\u2019s very good with cleaning the kitchen and living room whenever there is a mess but her own room is another matter.  Granted its a small room so it\u2019s clutters up quicker, I just think its ridiculous and easy to keep clean given the size. There\u2019s always things on her dresser and left out and she keeps her clothes on her chair instead of in the closet or laundry basket. I used to ask her to tidy up but she would always say it is tidy so I tidy it myself now. It\u2018s become a running joke in the house that she is messy and it seems to have caught on with Mara too. Whenever Mara is tired or fussy or she thinks Jess is boring her, she will call her messy. I never used to think it bothered Jess until today since she has never said so. Mara was acting out due to a bad sleep last night and told Jess that to go away because she is messy and Jess flipped out at me. She is apparently tired of it being a running joke because she deems herself not messy. However, I see the state of her room compared to the rest of the house and she is messy by definition. Mara would not apologise and Jess refuses to be around Mara until I make this stop. She says it\u2019s annoying to be constantly called something she is not.  My husband is on Jess\u2019s side (he is also more laidback cleaning-wise) and that we should stop so Mara does not copy what she hears but I think Jess is being ridiculous and being messy is not an unfair comment. Her room is not tidy hence it is messy. AITA?",

I'm reading these whenever the aurora dips and I'll try to reply when I can. I've noticed some people think I'm deathly afraid of spiders and would freak out if somebody brought a pet spider with them. No, because you can only have dogs and cats here. If I saw one in the elevator, I'd take another one like an adult. I (27F) live in a building that allows up to 2 dogs with no breed or weight restrictions. I have a 12 YO Chiweenie who's nothing but sweet. She rarely barks and does good with everybody, including cats. I took the elevator so she could go on her walk (sit down on the sidewalk), and this kid (20-ish) was in there first. He asked me to not come in, but I told him we have every right to use the elevators and came in. He basically squished himself into the opposite corner, started shaking, and asked me to put her behind my legs because he's scared of dogs. I told him that if he's scared of dogs, he shouldn't live in a dog-friendly apartment. He stuttered out that he wasn't asking much of me. I told him that it's entitled to ask others to accommodate his triggers. By the time this was over, he literally ran out the elevator. This one lady working at the front desk asked me if everything was okay, and I told her he was being a baby over sharing an elevator with my 7 pound dog. She went, I don't want to get involved, but the next time something like that happens, please take the next elevator. I didn't want to get on management's shit list, so I just nodded and walked away. I asked a few neighbors who have dogs, and they all said I was in the wrong and shouldn't have even gone in the elevator. I asked my friends and family, and everybody thought I was being rude. My aunt replied, It costs nothing to be kind to people despite what your generation seems to think. AITA? I'm scared of spiders but I don't make it everybody else's problem.",

I was recently having diner with my sister whose daughter graduated in CS 2 years ago and was a junior programmer. She worked for iRobot but got laid off recently. We were talking about tech related topics while we were having diner and she seemed like someone passionate about the industry so I mentioned that there were openings at my workplace. She then inquired about job referrals. Since we never really worked together, I told her I could do so but I\u00b4'd like to ask her a question to gauge her knowledge and would only refer her if she passed. I asked her a problem I knew of the top of my head on dynamic programming to use CS concepts to maximize the amount of coins by opening boxes, which is quite similar to a popular problem on bursting balloons (on leetcode). She failed to produce an efficient answer within 45 minutes and only finally got it after an hour and a half after a hint so I said I could not refer her but she was free to apply on her own. My sister is now upset at me and called me an asshole and said I should still try to help her and that it was unfair to test her on the spot. The thing is I don\u00b4't want to take any risks as if I did refer her, she would probably get hired as our interviews are very easy and almost all refereed candidates get hired. But then if she performed badly after being refereed it would reflect really badly on me.

        "selftext": "My husband (34m) and I (27f) recently adopted a kitten (0.438m) together. I want to get the kitten neutered as soon as possible: he is an indoor cat; I don't want to deal with spraying and other pubescent feline behaviour. My husband is against neutering him, saying he dislikes the idea of altering his physiology. This is not a pedigree cat; my husband has no plans of getting him to sire kittens. I don't believe he understands what keeping him intact is going to entail. I feel like he sees neutering as a threat to his masculinity. I am thinking of neutering the kitten without my husband's consent but feel like that'd be wrong. That's the TL;DR.  We have agreed before that it's best if he stays an indoor cat. We're living in a house right now but we are renting and ultimately don't have a strong anchor anywhere; we are likely to move in the next two years. Our cat may be moved around quite a lot in his lifetime so it's safest and most comfortable for him if he doesn't get used to roaming, which intact males are driven to do. My husband understood and seemed to agree with me before, when we discussed this ahead of getting the cat.   Now that it's the best time to neuter, my husband has changed his mind 180 and would like to allow our cat to get out. All of the sudden, Nextdoor posts about run-over cats seem like nothing next to a quick, safe, proven-to-help surgical procedure.  I think he might see my insistence on neutering our cat as an insult to his own masculinity: in one conversation, he got agitated and said I would neuter *him* if I had the chance.  Dear reader, while I am a fan of vasectomy as an idea, my husband has never been under pressure to get one or gotten one, and that is not the subject of the present debate.  So my dilemma is as follows: he's got a work trip coming up in a few days, and I might just take the cat to the vet for a quick snippy snap while he's away. But what broke my heart is that he said none of his male friends who have neutered male cats love their cats. I did see one of those friends interact with his cat (one that has *implants*); it was not great.  For added context, we don't have kids; have been together for 8 years; we have lived with a cat before, my husband's female intact cat. I thought he hated dealing with her in heat, seeing her suffer, as much as I did; he talked about getting her neutered for the entire three years she lived with us, but life always got in the way. Perhaps he hated the idea of neutering cats all along? (We moved out of the country and that (now older) cat is keeping my husband's grandmother company now. She's fine as far as I can tell.) However, that was entirely his call to make; this one is our shared responsibility, which is why I'm hesitant to make it on my own.  Edit to change 'knowledge' in paragraph #1 to 'consent': I told my husband I was considering / posting this as the post was going live.  UPD: we talked about this again. He has one (1) male friend with a neutered male cat, referred to above, and zero (0) friends with intact male cats. He was just being an idiot relying on the way things used to be in his village when he was a kid and it doesn't help that there's someone else's apparently intact male cat roaming the neighbourhood. He's chronically online but not in the same way as I am, i.e. I've known cats are supposed to stay indoors + be neutered FOR AGES and he watches cats on Reels. We're getting the cat neutered; not getting a divorce, sorry to disappoint \u2014 he's a ding dong but he's my ding dong. Thank you all for the comments, I've read some that helped me understand his point of view and get through to him in ways I hadn't tried before!  UPD 2 after reading some more comments: 1. A huge shout out to all the vets here, and all the volunteers working with pets. Thank you for your work, and for your time spent dealing with asshats. 2. My dudes some of y'all have not been in long-term relationships and it shows. It would've been a completely different story if it happened when we first got together, but it *didn't*, which is the reason I found it as weird as you did. We've been married for 3 years. I definitely knew what I was doing. ",

Eight months ago, our twins were born, and Eve decided to stay home with them (her decision, not mine). For some context, I grew up in a wealthy family, while Eve did not. Her mother, a single mom, was loving but had to work a lot, which influenced Eve\u2019s decision to stay home with our children. Now, I grew up with incredibly loving parents until I was 12. Everything changed when my dad was in a car accident that drastically altered him. He became angry, constantly yelled, and even started cheating on my mom. When I asked my mom why she didn\u2019t leave him, she explained that she couldn\u2019t afford to give us (three kids) the same lifestyle\u2014gated community, private schools, etc. So, she stayed with him until he passed away a few years later. Because of this, when my wife and I got married, I opened a separate account for her and one for our children. My intention was that, if for any reason I changed or became difficult to live with like my dad, Eve wouldn\u2019t feel trapped or pressured to stay. Every month, I deposit a percentage of my income into these accounts. Both accounts are now approaching six figures, with the kids\u2019 account having a bit more. Here\u2019s where things get complicated. A few weeks ago, we went on vacation and left my sister house-sitting. For some reason, she went through my office and found the paperwork for these accounts. I hadn\u2019t told my wife about them yet because she\u2019s proud and doesn\u2019t like receiving big financial gifts, so I was trying to figure out how to bring it up without upsetting her. Well, my sister told my mom, and they both confronted me. My mom was angry because I didn\u2019t give her money for an upcoming surgery (she doesn\u2019t actually need the money, as she inherited from my dad and we already help her financially). I explained that I created the accounts to prevent my wife from going through what my mom did, but both my mom and younger sister seemed to forget that part. The only person who\u2019s on my side is my older sister. Now, my wife is upset and says she doesn\u2019t want the money, that I should give it all to our kids or my mom.

        "selftext": "I (27F) have a strange living situation. I live with a family (Chris, 65M, Danielle, 59F, and their daughter) and do household chores in exchange for rent. I've lived here for 19 months; it's mostly smooth sailing. I work full-time and am applying to law school. Danielle has some issues with boundaries (she doesn't understand why she can\u2019t enter my room w/o permission, for example), and I know it's both due to age differences and the fact that they allow me to live in their house for free. I have to be very careful when enforcing boundaries. Yesterday, I made dinner for everyone after a full day of chores. Around 10 pm, as I was finishing the dishes, Danielle told me I needed to steam clean the carpet in the living room because the cats had peed all over it. I did, and as I was putting the steam cleaner away, Danielle entered and said she wanted me to do another room. Because it was 10:30 at this point and I still wanted to work on an application before bed, I politely but firmly said, I'm not going to do that. I probably should have said, I'll do it tomorrow, but I was exhausted, so I just said no. I put the machine away, submitted my application, and went to bed. Tonight, as I was finishing up my meal prep for the week, Danielle cornered me in the kitchen. I don't want to fight about this, she said, But I wanted to mention something. Last night when you told me you weren't going to clean the other room, I found it rude. You should be careful when you say things like that at work so that you don't get fired. I was floored. I snapped, Danielle, you haven't had a job since before I was born. You don't get to give me advice about how to act in the workplace. Danielle rolled her eyes and huffed, See, I didn't want to fight about this, and walked out of the room. I called after her, Then maybe don't bring it up?!? Danielle hasn't spoken to me since, and I don't know what's coming. For context, Danielle has only had one job in her whole life, from age 22 to age 25. After that, she quit to raise kids. I grew up very poor. I have been working since I was 14 and supporting myself since I turned 18. They offered to start our arrangement in 2023 because they needed help around the house and I was struggling financially. As for Danielle's work advice, I currently work as a Regional Manager at a small firm. Not only is her advice outdated, but I can't take it. I'm a people manager; a lot of my day-to-day job involves being polite but unyielding. I think she was frustrated by my setting a boundary and that's why she brought it up. I know part of my frustration is that I feel powerless to protest most of the time. I will be moving out in August of this year when I go to law school (hopefully!), and my goal is just to make it until then. I'm also really frustrated that Danielle felt like she could say whatever she wanted and then walk away as if I had no right to feel anything. AITA for what I said? UPDATE: First, as an aside, a lot of the comments here missed the point. Danielle was not angry with me for refusing to do an additional chore at 10:30pm; that was not the issue. Even by the most generous of understandings, demanding additional overtime work at the end of a 14-hour shift is unreasonable, and she knew that. During our follow-up discussion, she added a detail I had totally forgotten about \u2013 the second room in question has a large potted Fiddle-Leaf Fig tree in it, and in order to steam clean the additional room, the tree needs to be moved. Neither she or I were able to move it after multiple attempts, so at that point I said, \u201cUntil Chris and I can figure out a way to move this, the steam cleaning will have to wait. I know you want it done tonight, but I will not be doing that.\u201d Very important context that I missed adding when I was angry. The issue in question was the exchange the next day. As to how I responded the second day when she came to confront me on my wording, for that, I understand now that I was absolutely the asshole. As one of my close friends put it to me, \u201cThose are inside thoughts.\u201d My context about her work history was also unnecessary and irrelevant. Last night, I approached Danielle and opened the conversation with a profuse apology. No qualifiers, no protests, just that I was rude during our kitchen conversation and I needed to apologize. She in turn immediately apologized for her incredibly poor introduction to the follow-up conversation and for cornering me in the kitchen while I was otherwise occupied instead of meeting with me at a more neutral time. Chris then joined us and we had an extensive conversation. During the conversation, I asked them to define how they view our arrangement. They were immediately very clear that they don\u2019t see me as a tenant, employee, or servant. I pointed out that if that is how they want to view things, then I need to be free to say no extra requests. They were receptive to this. I also pointed out that in our state, I could either be considered a tenant or a live-in domestic worker, but due to the length of time I\u2019ve resided here and the conditions in place, I am definitely not considered just a guest. They did get offended that I see our relationship as fundamentally a transaction, which I found kind of funny, because while they have the freedom to frame it in their minds as \u201cwe\u2019re helping this person out and she\u2019s helping us out,\u201d it\u2019s wise for me to see it differently. I do have obligations to them and my life has substantially larger implications should this not work out. In the end, they agreed that because they aren\u2019t landlords and I am not their employee (in their minds), I should be receiving more freedom than I have been given. Chris and Danielle have chronic illnesses that make most of the work I do very difficult for them, including a lot of the care I provide for their adult daughter who lives with us. We then outlined (again) exactly what my responsibilities are and what they\u2019re not. Finally, to my surprise, they apologized for previous invasions of privacy and agreed that we would put a lock on my room door. It is an interior lock only so I can\u2019t lock it while I\u2019m gone, but I am fine with the progress. I was never threatened with eviction or anything like that; people can be emotionally mature enough to talk through issues instead of immediately pulling a metaphorical trigger, which is what happened here. After the conversation, I typed out a long email detailing the terms of my living here as it currently stands and had them send a confirmation in reply. While it is not officially a lease, it is something in writing outlining responsibilities that was agreed to by all parties. We agreed that my monthly hours would be reduced to 80 instead of the roughly 100 I have been doing. If the value of that is calculated according to the federal minimum wage, that\u2019s a value of $580 every four weeks, which is more than most rooms-for-rent are in our area. Of course, the labor I do is somewhat skilled and has a market value of at least double, but I used the federal minimum wage for the sake of argument. I also established that the latest I would be available for housework is 9:30pm, barring some form of emergency, and if a task absolutely requires going past that time, I will be taking that time back on a different day. I know that I will laugh at this in Contracts class in the future, but for now, I\u2019m fine with what it is. Like I said in a comment, it\u2019s not ideal but it works. I\u2019m not in a position where I desperately need this anymore, but I\u2019m going to stay here until August because being able to funnel what otherwise would be paid in rent into savings is doing wonders to set me up for the future. To everyone that commented something along the lines of \u201cYou have to do everything she says\u201d or \u201cYou\u2019re the help\u201d or \u201cYou\u2019re entitled,\u201d I encourage you to think about that perspective more. Employees, household help, and any people in a subordinate position are still very much an individual and deserving of basic respect to their space, their time, and their person. No laws, no matter how extensive, take those basic rights away. Also, if you said it was my \u201cfault\u201d for being in the situation in the first place, kick rocks. We are all working through our own situations where we pick the best option available even if it isn\u2019t perfect. That\u2019s not weakness or stupidity, that\u2019s life.",

        "selftext": "Throw away account because my friends use Reddit. I,(27m) am married to my wife (25f), who I will call Kate (fake name). Kate is pregnant with our second child, we recently found out we are having a baby girl. While we were discussing different baby names I suggested Charlotte (fake name).  Charlotte was my childhood best friend who unfortunately passed away when we were 18 in a car crash. The two of us were friends for our whole lives, once she left my life I told myself I would name one of my children after her. It just so happened that we are having a daughter next.  The issue is my mother was convinced me and Charlotte would get married. Neither me nor her liked each other in that way. My mother consequently hates Kate. She has never been afraid of telling Kate she will never be Charlotte. Whenever things like that come up we always leave, as neither of us want to listen to her ramble. I\u2019ve always told my mother that I love Kate, and she needs to drop her resentment towards her. It has gotten to the point where I have dropped my mother from my family and life. I couldn\u2019t take her degrading my wife anymore.After Kate heard my suggestion she left the house. She wouldn\u2019t respond when I asked her what was wrong, and hasn\u2019t respond to my messages. It\u2019s been a few days now, and I\u2019ve just been told she is with her parents and needs to be left alone for a few days. I understand that it is very possible that she probably has bad experiences with the name and just doesn\u2019t want to name our baby after her. Edit: I know my wife made a post on here as well, currently trying to keep up with all the comments.  Edit 2: I\u2019ve been reading a lot of the comments so I wanted to add a little. Yes my mother refuses to acknowledge our son as a real grandchild. Hell, she refused to believe the kid was mine. No, I don\u2019t think naming our daughter Charlotte will make my mother love her more. I think the same thing will happen with her. Yes my wife also has an argument before she left and didn\u2019t just walk out. ",

        "selftext": "I 26f have been dating an amazing man 39m for almost 6 months now. He is divorced and has a daughter 10f. She is a great kid and I love her.  Last night he told me he had a very important work meeting and wasn't going to be able to pick his daughter up from her playdate at her friends house today. I volunteered to pick her up and take her back to my place ( that she has been to many times ) and watch her until he got back because I work at home and it wouldn't be a problem.  He was okay with this and dropped off her booster seat with me earlier today.  I had to take care of some work before It was time to pick her up and it ended up taking longer then I had expected. I looked at the clock and saw that it was past the time to pick her up from her friends house, and I knew installing the booster seat would take up even more time, so I just went and picked her up without it.  When I picked up his daughter she asked why her booster seat wasn't there and I told her she was going to ride without it today and she'd be fine. She was very quiet the entire drive which seemed odd to me because she is usually a very talkative kid.  When my boyfriend got back his daughter went and hugged him and told him that I didn't have her booster seat for her. He confronted me about this and I told him I lost tack of time and so I just picked her up without it.  He was furious with me! He said it was so irresponsible of me to not have her booster seat for her and that I put her in danger.  I tried to calm him down and said how sorry I was but he didn't want to hear it. He took his daughter home and hasn't responded to my calls or texts since.  I also received a call from his ex wife where she expressed how upset she was at me for putting her daughter in danger.  I didn't think it would turn out to be such an issue.  AITA? ",

        "selftext": "We\u2019ve been dating for about 4 months and last night was the first time I met his family. They were nice at first but I couldn\u2019t stand the sight of them at the end of the night. Dinner conversation was normal as they asked about me and my family. Then the table divided into smaller conversation groups and I overheard his older brothers talking to his sister about investing. I\u2019m not an expert so I\u2019ll give you the gist of what I heard. She\u2019s been out of school for a couple of years and have saved up about $75,000 and wants to start investing. They said property is the best and that section 8 is the way to go. They said that the rent is always paid on time and the people won\u2019t mess up the property because they\u2019re afraid of getting kicked out of the program. They said the best part is that they\u2019ll still own the properties and the value will always go up. They said they\u2019re developing a small neighborhood with about 10 houses specifically for section 8. All of those houses under 2000 sqft and have 4 bedrooms as section 8 pays higher rates for more bedrooms and smaller houses are cheaper to maintain. They said that it\u2019ll cost them about $100/sqft to build these houses and the rent will be about $4000 per month. They said that she could buy in on her first rental house next year when they start another development. They\u2019re in the process of closing on a piece of land that will accommodate about 20 houses. I cringed then couldn\u2019t keep quiet anymore. I told them that instead of renting out and keeping those houses off the market, they should sell them to those people. They looked at me quietly and I knew they never considered helping people out by selling the houses they were building. His dad told me I was out of line and I answered that his family was out of line for preying on people in need while feeding off of the taxes people pay. I said that most people can\u2019t afford to buy a single house yet his sons are building 10-20 at a time which makes them leeches.  We argued for a bit then we left. This morning my boyfriend told me I need to apologize to his family but I refused to. We just met after my last class and told me we\u2019re no longer invited to any of his family function including the Christmas trip back to their old country. Since we're still in school, his family was going to pay for us so he really wants me to apologize and smooth things over. I know I\u2019m right but maybe I shouldn\u2019t have been so harsh on the first meeting. What do you think?  ",

        "selftext": "throwaway lol. my boyfriend (24m) and i (21f) have been officially together for around 5 months. he\u2019s had a full beard the entire time i\u2019ve known him, and i guess he\u2019s mostly kept a beard since he started growing facial hair around 15, so the only pictures i\u2019ve seen of him without one are from when he was in middle school or younger.  yesterday when he was on lunch at work he facetimed me and surprised me that he had gone fully shaved. he didn\u2019t tell me he was planning it so it kind of shocked me. when i answered the phone my first thought was that it was actually his hs aged brother that he lives with (that looks a lot like him), and when i realized it was him i kind of gasped and then couldn\u2019t help myself from laughing for a minute.  obviously he seemed kind of upset but i tried to make sure and tell him that i still like how he looks, i was just very surprised because he looks decently different and much much younger without facial hair and i wasn\u2019t expecting to answer the call to that.  he still seemed upset and quickly hung up afterwards, said something like \u201cthis is why i never fully shave\u201d. i was supposed to see him today but he\u2019s been pretty dry with few responses since then. AITA for my reaction?  EDIT: yes, i would definitely be upset if he initially laughed at me for cutting/dyeing my hair, but i\u2019d also expect it from at least a person or two if i fully shaved my head out of nowhere. either way, i know it probably hurt him more than i thought and i already apologized to him for laughing at first over text. planning to apologize in person too the next time i see him, and don\u2019t worry i will be showering him with compliments because i do think he still looks great!  EDIT 2: jesus christ, i shouldn\u2019t have said a minute because it wasn\u2019t literally a full minute. also maybe i didn\u2019t phrase it right but i definitely wasn\u2019t laughing at his face, just the sudden change and the fact that i somehow thought it was his younger brother ",

Twix is \u201cfree-range.\u201d Not completely, because that would be dangerous, but he\u2019s able to move freely between a small screened in porch area and a bedroom. I don\u2019t have any other animals, but I don\u2019t want to accidentally hurt him or let him hurt himself.  He has toys and water throughout the space, it\u2019s totally his, and I love being able to provide him with more freedom than a traditional cage. Bf has always found this gross but never made it a big deal. But it must have been boiling inside him, because when I was in the room playing with Twix the other day while bf was over, bf came into the room as well and stepped in some poop (which is bound to happen every once in a while with a free range guinea pig). Bf WENT OFF about how gross it is and how having this space for Twix was inconsiderate to him and if I loved him I would put Twix in a regular size cage and repurpose the extra room in my house for his use/more space for us to be together. My house is 2 bedrooms and like I said, I live alone, it\u2019s not like bf officially moved in. I love Twix and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to let someone change the way I\u2019ve always treated him. I feel like if Twix was a dog or cat it wouldn\u2019t be a problem because that\u2019s seen as more normal. My mother agrees I\u2019m not being fair to bf by \u201cputting an animal above a person.\u201d AITA? Edits for clarification: The areas Twix has free access to are covered in rubber and PVC flooring. Basically how you would set up a playpen, just larger scale.I am looking for a buddy for him \ud83d\udc96 but right now he's solo for a bit.Twix does poop on random areas of the floor, but has some consistent areas and I do clean up after him. I just can't clean up after him 24/7 and guinea pigs poop a lot.Twix is **not completely free-range around the entire house**, just in 2 rooms.",

Jess (obviously not her fault) is looking for attention that she's not getting from her parents. Both my fiance and I have politely told her that we are there to play with our daughter and make sure she's safe in the pool as she's only just learning to swim. We've had to do this because the Jess is incessantly talking to us to the point that we literally couldn't get a word in edgewise to encourage our own child.  At least 3 other families with children have decided to get out of the pool because Jess is in their personal space and simply won't leave them alone as well as a few older couples obviously there just trying to relax.  In the 3 days we have been here so far, we have not seen her parents spend any time in the pool with her and they seem obvious to the fact that she is getting in other people's way. I HAVE seen the dad in the pool in the deep end whilst Jess was harassing other people in the shallow end.  Also we have heard her ask multiple times for the parents to join her in the pool only to be flatly refused even though the dad would happily swim on his own. So yeah, WIBTA if I, politely as possible, told them that if they're going to come on holiday as a family then they should spend some time in the pool as a family? ",

        "selftext": "Sorry in advance everyone, English is not my first language but I am a content writer so you guys should be able to understand everything. Now, I am (25f) an Indian, and we have a ritual here. The wedding reception is held one day after wedding and in-laws give their DILs the saree they are supposed to wear for that particular function. I was well aware of that and I have seen this happening since my childhood. Now a little background for you all. My wedding is in 10 days and the date was finalised back in February. I do a job and I have invested my weekoffs shopping and planning most of the wedding.  I bought my wedding saree in March and that same day I liked another beautiful Benarasi Saree that I bought for wearing at the reception. Now, I discussed the thing with my fiance and asked him if his parents will be okay if I buy the saree and he told me I should go ahead and buy it and his parents would be more than happy to reimburse me because they are supposed to buy that for me anyway. He gave me the money I spent for that saree and I gave the blouse piece to my tailor so she could make a beautiful blouse for me. It was all sorted by May. Fast forward to today, my future FIL sent me a courier which contained the blouse piece of ANOTHER BENARASI SAREE and I was shocked to discover that they were not aware that I already purchased the saree that I am gonna wear for reception. I bought my finance\u2019s suit everything in a contrasting colour and bought my jewelleries accordingly. But NOW 10 days before I got to know my finance never told my future MIL or FIL that I already bought it in MARCH!  So, I don\u2019t want to disappoint them by not wearing the saree they have chosen for me. (I haven\u2019t seen it yet, but I am sure it would be nice). But at the same time, I really had a vision with the Saree I originally chose to wear for this function and I am very upset right now that it will not be fulfilled.  WIBTAH if I wear the one I originally planned to wear for this function instead of the one my future in laws bought for me? Update: Just got off a call with my fianc\u00e9 and he said it would be very \u201ccomplicated\u201d to talk to his parents now. I better wear the saree my future ILs bought for me and to make it up to me, he will purchase a new set of suit that will go appropriately with the saree. He will also go shopping with me again and bring the saree with him so I can find an appropriate blouse to go with it. P.S I have not seen the saree yet, he said he will send a picture tomorrow. Also, I am heartbroken and in tears as I write this because I believe all these could have been resolved with some better communication.  Update 2: Today my fianc\u00e9 denied that he ever had anything to do with it and told me \u201cwho asked you to go ahead and buy it?\u201d And also told me I should wear the saree his parents have chosen for me (I still haven\u2019t seen it). So, there you all go people I am marrying an asshole I guess. Lot of money has been invested and cannot call it off now, but I am very happy for the support you all gave me. Best of luck to me, will come back with another update after the reception. ",

She accused me of thinking she was some sort of charity case and said that my offer made her feel inadequate and embarrassed about her financial situation. She told me that she didn't want to feel indebted to anyone and that she wanted to achieve her goals on her own. I tried to explain that I was just trying to help and that I didn't see her as a charity case at all. I just wanted to ease her burden and support her in any way I could. A few days ago, we got into a big fight. She was venting about her college dues, and I snapped and told her that if she wouldn't let me help by paying for it, then she shouldn't keep bringing it up around me. She got really mad and accused me of not being supportive. Since then, she hasn't been talking to me at all.
