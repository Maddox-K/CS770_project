        "selftext": "Recently my father and I got into a huge political disagreement. We've always disagreed about some topics but over the years he's gotten worse. I (20 F) and my dad (45 M) have always talked about changes in the country or things that scare us. We used to be able to have a normal Ish conversation about these topics which include women's health or gay rights, but he's gotten increasingly more hostile about the conversation topics. A few months ago, I stopped talking to him for a few weeks because of it. It was really hard for me because the conversation ended with him saying cruel things to me. Such as... you need a man to get preg. Can't elaborate more but I'm sure you get what he said. For more context, I'm gay and engaged to a woman. We've been engaged for about 6 months now and were planning on wait till she was finished with school. Now we're both scared with the current circumstances that we won't have that chance. Though nothing is for certain of course, nothing is impossible. With the recent TikTok ban, which everyone has entitled opinions about, I tried to have a conversation with my dad about this and he turned into a screaming a-hole. It was an hour-long conversation which I did my best to be respectful, but he started to make comments about my age claiming that my opinions didn't matter because of that. Anytime I tried to speak he cut me off to yell at me. I can't go to in depth with our political beliefs because it is against guidelines, but he is red, and I am neither or. I can't agree with much of anything on the red or blue side because of my beliefs and things I've done for my own personal research.  After about an hour of him yelling and screaming at me, I finally put my foot down and told him, If you continue to yell at me, I will hang up this call and we can go a few months without speaking. This is my boundary, and you need to respect it. I never want to talk about these things with you because we obviously can't come to a mutual agreement- he cut me off to continue screaming at me and calling me a child.  I hung up and blocked him on everything. I felt so guilty for it. Now my fianc\u00e9 and I have our wedding planned in March. It's been a couple weeks since my father and I have spoken but he wanted to be there and make the rings for us as well. I feel extremely conflicted because my mom is performing the ceremony for us. She has her opinion about the situation and seems to think it's a good idea if he's not there. I've made jokes about it in passing but it's making me feel so sick to my stomach. This is my first wedding and the first relationship that has been healthy for me. Both of my parents love her, and I wanted to have everyone there. Now I don't know what to do. I'm scared my mom's side of the family will disagree with me and say that I'm wrong for inviting him, but I'm scared that I will feel guilty for the rest of my life for not trying to fix things with him so he can be there. AITAH if I don't invite him?",

        "selftext": "throwaway acc, dont want personal info on my main.   so the other day my (17 m) dad walked in and asked me if I'd bought any valentines for my mom, stepmom, and brother. I was kind of caught off-guard and i said no, and he told me i needed to 'get on that'. i struggle to tell with him what's a suggestion vs what's a demand/if i don't do it I'll be in trouble, and getting in trouble is very stressful for me for some context: my parents divorced when i was little and have 50/50 custody. both remarried a few years after. mom set firm boundaries with how her and my stepdad parent me, she sees it as her job to parent me and he can be the fun stepdad but he doesn't get to discipline me, that's her job dad took a different approach, and let stepmom do a lot of parenting of me when i was young. we did not have the best relationship in the past , but it's better now, enough to where we can spend time together sometimes and i don't really mind her. she's nice and i appreciate all she does but she's not really a parent to me.   i asked my mom when i next saw her, and she said she doesn't want anything. i might make something as a thank you for her (she always gets me candy and trinkets for valentines since i don't really get valentines otherwise) and maybe i'll grab some candy for my brother since he's a kid (still in elementary) but i've never gotten either of them gifts for valentines before and it's never been an issue, and i dunno if doing that now will cause issues so maybe I'll just get something for little bro im not sure how relevant it is, but i do have suspected autism (multiple professionals we saw highly suspected it and recommended testing)but i haven't been able to get the assessment yet so no official diagnosis.   i only mention this because I'm not always the best with social situations, so it's not unheard of to be told I was rude on accident/am not doing something the way it's supposed to be done. but at the same time, I feel like it would've come up sooner if it was something expected of me? I'm not sure, I don't want to be rude at all I'm mostly just confused i dunno what dad will say if i don't get her anything, i don't want it to be a big deal really i just think it's kind of odd, but now I'm thinking about just getting her something small to avoid any fights. valentines day is approaching fast and I'm kinda nervous about it   so, WIBTA if i don't get her anything ? I'm genuinely not sure anymore. my friends i asked said it's fine but most of my friends don't really like my dad (and are also MY friends so ofc they'd side with me..) so I'd like an unbiased opinion on this. thanks for the help",

Here are the colors.  Ive wanted a cardigan from steady hands for forever. I can't justify spending 50+ on a cardigan for myself. My husband looses a bet and says send me the site. I send him my Wishlist so he can pick and it's still a surprise. *they have funky little designs. Worms, goblins, birds. Funky little stuff with pockets*So the package gets here and it's two tiktok cardigans.. they're cute.. but I'd never get them for myself.. I'm short and one is long, so it comes to my calves.. no pockets. The other is brown.. I dont own a single brown peice of clothing but the design is cute enough. I thought I acted happy. I was a little disappointed so I'm sure it showed but I tried them both on and said I loved them. It's really not a huge deal to me. But I guess I really hurt him. He said I I'm a bad gift getter and I tried so hard to assure him I liked them, I was just surprised. It didn't work, he wouldn't let me hug him. It's been a huge fight. He said he looked for a long time to find them for me.. aita",

        "selftext": "For context I, (19 female) have been in a relationship with my boyfriend for almost a year. Recently we\u2019ve been having some little problems here and there but nothing major.  This weekend, I am going to an event with him and some friends. Some of the female friends attending the event will be spending the night at my house the night of the event. My boyfriend had decided to stay the night with one of his friends as a result of this.  We had loosely discussed doing something together on Saturday after the event we are attending tomorrow. I expressed to him on the phone that I wanted to stay home instead of seeing him because i\u2019ve been backed up with school and work. We both have part time jobs and live 45 minutes away, so sometimes it\u2019s not a fun commute from one place to another.  He began to get very irritated with me because i was ultimately cancelling on him but still seeing my friends the same weekend. When i explained to him that i don\u2019t see these friends very often and it was the day before our event and i couldn\u2019t just cancel the plans he became even more upset towards me. He then hung up and continued to bug me about seeing him. I told him i felt as though he was being very inconsiderate and selfish, he has not talked to me since. I can very clearly see why he would be upset because i\u2019m cancelling our plans but i don\u2019t see why he thinks im being so rude for being tired and or stressed. So, WIBTA if i still attend the event and have my friends stay the night instead of strictly seeing my boyfriend?",

Our relationship is built on open and honest conversations, and I don\u2019t have that kind of connection with many people\u2014even family. I\u2019ve known this friend for years, and they\u2019re a genuinely good person. That being said, they recently made a very damaging mistake, and it has consumed their life. While things have improved slightly over the past few weeks, they\u2019re still far from moving on. I\u2019ve been by their side from the beginning, supporting them when no one else would. They truly appreciate it, but at this point, I just can\u2019t take it anymore. Today, I genuinely wanted to tell them to stop talking about their mistake. It\u2019s all they think about\u201424/7. I don\u2019t want to abandon them or make them feel worse, but I\u2019m exhausted. Even though their situation was critical at first, things have settled somewhat, yet they still bring it up constantly. I\u2019ve tried shifting the conversation, suggesting we hang out and have fun, making small talk, and even recommending professional help, but they reject every attempt or fail to take the hint. I know it might sound selfish to just want to talk about video games, sports, or anything else, but no matter what, they always redirect the conversation back to their mistake. I\u2019m not a therapist, and I\u2019m tired of hearing about a problem I can\u2019t solve. Would I be the asshole for telling them that they need to work through this on their own and that I don\u2019t want to talk about it anymore? ",

        "selftext": "Background - on a flight a few weeks ago, I was seated towards the middle of the plane, behind a very nice family. A mom traveling with her two kids. One was a baby, probably under 3 and the other was a 6 year old. Our flight had been delayed a few times while we were seated on the tarmac, the kids were getting a little restless & a young-ish woman across from them entertained them until we took off. When we got to our destination, it was around an hour or two later than the anticipated arrival time & very early in the morning (1-3 am, can\u2019t recall the exact time). Naturally, people were complaining about missing/making connected flights. The woman who had been helping the family took it upon herself to block the entire aisle until that family had gotten out of their seats and de-planed. Obviously chaos ensued. Some people *mouthed* off to the lady telling her to let them go through, people were questioning what was \u201cholding up the line\u201d among other comments. I overheard the mom (quietly) tell to the lady telling her she didn\u2019t want her to hold the line up & that they were in no hurry to get off. They were sitting down. She also said they normally waited to de-board, as it was easier with the baby. I took it upon myself to politely ask the woman if the rest of us behind her could go since the mom had said she didn\u2019t mind waiting. She turned around and *yelled* at me saying I didn\u2019t know what the mom wanted because I hadn\u2019t bonded (?) with them on the flight, and that a mom would never ask someone to hold up a line but that they\u2019d appreciate it internally, because moms are never respected by the public? I was so shocked I didn\u2019t know what to say because I\u2019d thought I was being polite & had overheard the mom saying it was fine to let everyone else go first. I just wanna know AITA in this situation? I feel like I\u2019m not but that woman yelling at me sure made me feel like I was. Edit: The mom and her kids did eventually get off but it was so awkward because the mom had clearly been prepared to wait, and all of a sudden had to get all of her stuff together and get off the plane, because of what this lady was doing for her. I feel like in that situation it would\u2019ve just been better for the lady to drop the Good Samaritan act because it was doing more harm than good?",

I'll refer to them as coworker A and coworker B. These two so happen to be roommates, btw. I am always hearing about their living conflicts at work and I get it; living with people is hard and I listen from a place of non-judgement. However, I feel as though I get put in situations where if I please one, I displease the other. I like both of them and I'm not a people pleaser, but its not like I want people to think poorly of me, either. Yesterday coworker A took B's drink from the fridge. Today B asked me who took the drink, and I was completely honest. I said A took it. This begun a conflict between them and I'm sitting there red in the face because I told the truth and all I could muster was an apology for even saying something. Clearly it isn't a world ending conflict, it just ended with B thanking me for saying something and A going back to her office.  I would never yap about something I KNOW I shouldn't. When either of them vent to me it is completely confidential-- but when I get put into a situation like this one I tend to just be honest instinctively. I hate being put in situations like this because I am displeasing one or the other, and I don't really know what else to do except be honest. I'm afraid I look like a 'squeaker' now... and maybe this does make me one. I can't help but to feel bad about this situation. I'm afraid I come off as an untrustworthy or loose-lipped. Personally, if someone took my drink I wouldn't really care but I'd be curious as to who it was. Coworker A even bought me lunch today :( So, Reddit... did I do coworker A dirty?  ",

I also want to put it out there that I am in a family who uses Life360, as a way of \u201csecurity to make sure we\u2019re doing alright.\u201d But I know damn well that it makes it difficult for me to be free and go places without people knowing.

My dad then comes and then asks me to \u201creconsider the date and push it further because that way my mother won\u2019t feel bad anymore\u201d This comment triggered me because it comes off that I can\u2019t do something for ME to be stable and happy, but I have to fold for others to make THEM stable and happy. Or that my decisions and choices are too much when already I am doing stuff and even more at my job.  So I am struggling to confidently say that I will proceed with my appointment because there is that lingering guilt of hurting my parents.

Now my mom was raised in a men do the work household, so she I think believes that we shouldn\u2019t complain since it was harder for them when she was a kid. here's an example, last week, we watched a movie in our home, during movies it's sometimes just hard to hear especially at home when everyone just talks all the time, l asked my brother and my mom if they could quiet down during the movie, my mother tells me, (not word for word) if I don't like them talking I can get up and go to my room. I didn't feel like fighting her on something so simple, like being quiet during a movie so I got up took my food (was eating) and started walking to my room , she seemed surprised, most likely because i usually just let it go, and asked me 'are you really gonna go into your room?' I responded \u2018yeah, you said go into my room if i have a problem with it.\u2019 Now I'm socially tone deaf so I tried to keep my voice calm and respectful but I don't know if I raised my voice or not. We had a whole argument over that.  At some point I said it was just a personal pet peeve, which (correct me if I'm wrong) I believe means you really dislike that specific thing, or it just really bothers you, which in this case, I do indeed have one. Then i just stopped talking, i was originally gonna agree and come back out, but she kept interrupting me before i could reach that conclusion, which was when i decided to shut my mouth, I just need to know if I\u2019m in the wrong here, maybe im being a bratty kid here but i feel like each time i try to ask for something to stop, it turns into an argument.AITA?",

        "selftext": "disclaimer! I'm not from the US and English is not my first language so apologies for mistakes I work for a large company (think on the scale of Google/Microsoft) who hire many new recent university graduates every year. We have a group chat, regularly meet up as a big group and are all friendly with each other. Now of this group, I only knew one girl, lets call her Amy, prior to being hired as we went to university together and even though we have very different interests, have stayed very good friends. About 3 months ago, I decided to start a book club and put a message in the larger chat asking if people wanted to join. About 5 people joined my group (Amy was not one of them) and we started book club, we've read 3 books so far and meet once a month.  Upon choosing our latest book, a historical fiction novel, one of the members of the club had a really good idea, that we should visit the location the book is based on and do a historical tour, visit museums and heritage sites and link it to our discussion. We all thought this was a really good idea and have planned out the whole trip, including bookings and tickets, we leave in 3 weeks Amy found out about the trip and is really hurt I didn't invite her, she says a holiday sounds fun and she is close to the other girls in the book club and Amy feels excluded because she won't be a part of this trip. She says that fact that I planned this all behind her back is very 'snakey' and she wouldn't have excluded me like that. She mentioned how fun the nightlife is, bars etc and how it's going to look weird that we are all on holiday without her. Now we wouldn't be interested in doing any of this things, some of the members of the club don't drink, and we were honestly just going for museums, and to tie into the book we were reading. Unfortunately we've already booked everything and we really don't have the availability to add another person, furthermore, I did just want a chill book-ish trip, not a 'girls trip'.  Amy has became really upset and accused me of alienating her from her friends and I'm actually feeling very guilty now, and wondering if I'm just being stubborn and whether I should have told her about the trip from the beginning, and maybe she could have read the book and joined us, but as Amy doesn't like reading and hasn't been a member of the club, I didn't think she would be interested. But i can see how she feels alienated and I do feel guilty, AITA? ",

        "selftext": "Hi, so today I (16F) was working on some English homework in my room when my mom (46F) came in. For some context, my family is Muslim, and my mother is extremely religious to a point the rest of us are not. Regardless, I still complete the five daily prayers every day to avoid her getting mad at me, because if I stop, it could result in her pulling me out of school and trying to marry me off, as she's threatened to do. My mom is known among my sister, my father, and I to be narcissistic and emotionally immature, but she refuses to get help or accept that she has a problem. We just put up with her behavior all the time, but sometimes I snap a bit. My mom was telling me that I need to complete the night prayers right after we eat dinner so she can watch me pray and see that I'm actually doing it. I responded that I do pray but I do it before I go to sleep because I'm usually right in the middle of something before dinner and want to finish it up. She began saying that she doesn't hear me get out of bed to pray at night and she doesn't believe that I actually do it. I told her I'm not sure why she doesn't hear me because I do get up and pray, but she kept accusing me of lying. I was in the middle of trying to finish this assignment and I was frustrated that she was making it *my* problem that *she* can't hear me. I asked her if she wants me to be louder or something and she said No, I just want you to tell me why I can't hear you, and I want you to actually pray. I got fed up and here's where I may be TA. I told her (politely but firmly) that I was done with this conversation because it wasn't going anywhere and asked if she could leave me alone so I could work. She kept nagging me to answer her question and told me I can't ask her to leave whenever I feel like it, and I responded by telling her that I already answered her question and she was distracting me and there was no point in continuing the conversation when she wasn't listening to me. I then reminded her that she does this all the time, comes in my room and starts accusing me of things and doesn't listen to my side of the argument, & why should we have more conversations like this when we already know how it's going to go? She tearfully told me that if I don't want her in my room she'll leave, and I politely responded, Oh, okay, you can leave then. She yelled, You don't want me in your room? Fine, write it down then. This is the last time I'm ever stepping foot in your room. She proceeded to slam the door extremely hard and hasn't spoken to me since. It's true that I was annoyed with my mom for accusing me of lying and repeating the same things over and over again. I feel like her slamming the door so hard and having that reaction to a pretty reasonable request was a bit of an overreaction, but I'm worried asking her to leave me alone was too harsh. However, I didn't say anything in a rude or yelling tone, I tried my best to maintain my composure and say everything calmly. AITA? ",

She has no understanding of boundaries, overshares, can be very rude... The type that picks a vegan restaurant then complains to the waitress that they don't have bacon & eggs. Kyle wants to have a good relationship with her but it's hard. I'm polite with Mary but spending time with her is difficult. I actually suggested the trip because she regularly complains that Kyle spends more time with his father than with her, and I know it makes him feel bad. One evening towards the end of the trip, we were all sitting together watching TV and the conversation drifted to Kyle's father, John. John is a generally good guy, and both Kyle and I have a good relationship with him. Mary & him were never together as a couple. Mary started saying mean things about Kyle's father, then suddenly went off about him, telling us how he's a terrible person and now he's got a cushy little life because of all the money from the settlement. Kyle's father is a victim of malpractice, he went in for a routine operation and ended up heavily handicapped. He almost died & had to stop working. He sued and got money from the hospital. I got angry and told her to stop this type of talk and that considering he almost died and was handicapped for life, it was hardly cushy. She told me she could say whatever she liked and that he'd made her life hard back in the days so she could be mean now. I answered I didn't have to stay and listen to this type of shit and left for bed. Afterwards Kyle told me he hadn't said anything because he was so used to it but he was happy I'd told her to stop. The next day she didn't talk about the argument. Three weeks after we left, Kyle called her to get some news. She told him that we had hurt her when we were are her place, and that she found my attitude disrespectful and mean. I feel kind of insane right now so: am I the asshole?",

I have been telling him for months I need help around here, especially since I feel like he creates more work for me (he can be a slob) and I feel unappreciated.  His response is to tell me that if I want him to do something, all I need to do is ask.  I feel that he lives here and can see when things need to be cleaned, he shouldn\u2019t wait to be asked. He claims he doesn\u2019t always \u201csee\u201d the mess the way I do. Recently I asked him to fix a few things around the house that are still not done.  These aren\u2019t especially difficult tasks, but he said he\u2019d do them a month ago.  This tends to be a reoccurring theme that when I do ask, if it doesn\u2019t get done I end up doing things myself, then he gets mad about my attitude. Fast forward to today, I\u2019m doing laundry.  My laundry, and the towels, sheets, dog blankets.

I got a boyfriend (24M - 2Y together) a few months after she got one herself, and since she's been SO weird about it.After a while I realized she was jealous; she told me he would steal me from her and would roll her eyes everytime I mention him, to the point where she would mock me to the friends we were with (oh, everything's about him \u2013 my friends were always like what? whatever and never paid much mind). I SWEAR I don't make ANY thing about him, I just mention him as he is part of my life and recently moved in with me. I have never ONCE complained or said anything bad about her boyfriend, and yet she makes an effort to complain about mine. It's always been like this, but recently it's gotten worse.Every time I ask if something's wrong, she just shrugs me off, saying everything's fine. I once had a heart to heart with her because I felt she was distancing herself from me; she said I was distancing myself from her and I wasn't even on social media as much as I used to be. I was in my final year of college, on top of working a full time job. I didn\u2019t have time to be on social media as much as before because I DIDN'T HAVE TIME. We finished the talk on good terms but she keeps being weird with me, distancing herself and making weird remarks about my boyfriend. Recently we all went out and she told him she's better when her suggestion for MY DRINK was favored instead of my boyfriend's. Afterwards, I couldn't take it anymore and asked her privately what I had done to her. She shrugged me off again, but I insisted. Why was she acting weird towards my boyfriend for so long and distancing herself from me? Did I do anything? When she said I spent all my time with him, I told her that no, he LIVES with me and everytime I asked her to go out for a drink/a meal with me/our friend group (without my bf) she refused. I'm not distancing myself from her; she's distancing herself from me. I told her she was so scared of me distancing myself from her that she did it first. She got mad at me and said that my boyfriend was taking up all my time, and she was not to blame. I got mad as well and told her You know what? Grow up. You're being JEALOUS, and you're not acting like a 23 year old about it. How come you spend time with your boyfriend and I've never said anything about it, but when I spend time with mine you have so much to say? Grow up. I can have a love life as much as you can.. She didn't budge, and so I left. Am I the asshole for telling her to grow up over her jealousy over my boyfriend? I'm literally so done with this. She set up a self-fulfilling prophecy that I was going to abandon her and she's doing it herself. And after all, her remarks about my boyfriend really hurt me because he hasn't done anything to deserve her anger (they barely talk. she doesn't let him talk and he has since given up on trying to win her over).I really miss my best friend but she's acting unreasonable.",

It is now a day before the weekend we are supposed to film and my brother has just said that he's going to his girlfriend's house for the weekend.  I remind him that he said he was free for filming this weekend but he asked if the date could be changed to next weekend. This doesn't work for me for multiple reasons, 1- we are getting a cat next weekend and where I plan to film is the room where the cat will be staying until it has settled in and I don't want to stress it out by moving its things around and forcing it to move (it's a relatively small room). 2- I want to enjoy my holiday after many stressful projects and spend time with the cat.  I think it's unfair that I have to change the date that I'm filming because he forgot, this isn't the first time he has forgotten something like this. My brother disagrees and is calling me a baby (I cry when I am angry and we had been arguing for a few minutes now) and that I can still spend time with the cat and film next weekend. I told him he didn't know what he was talking about as he wasn't the one to do research about the cat and how to introduce them slowly to the house, honestly he doesn't really care about it.

When I was around 13-14 my aunt with two disabled children(who are now 21)asked if I would be willing to take a job with the agency she goes through for the children's benefits The deal she explained to me was she would put the hours in and collect the checks at the end of the week but come tax season I would make out great with taxes. unfortunately, at the time my mother was in the midst of her addiction and wasn't there to explain the consequences of what this could bring, at 13 I agreed to what my aunt was asking, not fully aware of what it meant. I tried filing the taxes probably three times with the w2s from both of the children and ended up owing or getting nothing back because I was working when she was claiming I worked for her as well. when I was 21, I demanded that she stop claiming wages in my name. she told me she had done so and stopped, again I owed on taxes. so, to my knowledge for the past 6 years she was not claiming wages in my name after I said stop like I said before my work is seasonal for the most part with bartending festivals and the beach club only being open summer-late fall, HR suggested to file unemployment since they had to push our reopen date back a month. when I applied for unemployment the woman, I was speaking to informed me that I had wages in another state from my aunt's children, my wages in all states will be looked at and sent to me for review that was three days ago. that paperwork came in two days ago it showed within the last year my aunt has claimed $61,568 in my name. I immediately contacted her through text (I have been refusing to speak on the phone in case I need messages documented) and begged to know why she didn't stop when I asked her 6 years ago to stop since those wages potentially made me ineligible for unemployment, I did find out today that I will be getting unemployment based off those wages as well. the woman I spoke to said I'd be getting more for unemployment because of those wages. Since she has been claiming that amount for that long in my name plus, I haven't filed the taxes because I had no idea that she was still doing it. she did say again she would stop but she didn't last time. My mother is freaking out on my aunt. my 80-year-old grandfather has called to see what is going on and I was honest with him but he's just trying to do damage control so no one will report my aunt. I don't want her to get arrested, but I cannot pay the taxes that are owed. she has reached out and told me to do the taxes and she will take care of them. but the point is she should have never kept going to begin with, I agreed and said I wouldn't be paying the taxes she would as soon as I find out how much they are, as well id appreciate financial help since she's been doing this to me for years.

        "selftext": "Hello! I have to give backstory so bear with me pls My mum (44f)and dad (44m) broke up when I was 3 years old and my brother was 6. At first for a couple weeks my dad didn\u2019t see us, until he met his new girlfriend and she made sure he started to see us, very soon into their relationship they announced they were having a baby together. We continued seeing them every Fortnight until my half brother was about one and that\u2019s when my dad and half brothers mum split up.  After that I don\u2019t remember much of my dad until I was around 7 which is when he met his 3rd gf. They had two kids together and got engaged but they broke up and dipped:/ from about 7-14 I think I saw my dad like 5 times \ud83c\udf1a Anyway I\u2019m now 17 and for about three years my dad has called every now and again, he normally asks how we are and makes small talk, he says hell call on birthdays (normally doesnt) there\u2019s so many reasons as to why he hasn\u2019t called (normally a medical issue or mental health) I don\u2019t know what\u2019s true and what\u2019s not and I\u2019ve tried to ask but he just shuts down.   When he would call he would also make sure that me and my brother and mum wouldn\u2019t tell my little brothers mums that he was speaking to us and he only ever called us on private number(I literally never understood why but it seemed shady) A few weeks ago I found out from my half brothers mum that he has another child, one he had never said anything about, me and my older brother were so shocked so when he next called we asked him about the baby. Pretending not to hear us would be an understatement \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d After not \u201chearing us\u201d he hung up. He\u2019s called about 7 times in the past three months and every single time we ask him we get no answer. My uncle is really nice and has his own little family, when we last spoke I told him about my dads kid, he was shocked, but that was about it, he knew nothing I think my dad finally wants to see my brother and me but I don\u2019t know if I even want to see him, I don\u2019t know him that well and I struggle with even speaking to him,but if I don\u2019t see him I feel guilty. He pretends like he never left, I\u2019ve never had a proper conversation with him about any of it because he only communicates on surface level. It lowk messes w me sometimes, some days I care and some days I literally don\u2019t see him as my dad and I feel guilty about that even though he left and made those decisions.  Am I the asshole for choosing not to see my dad and breaking the news to his brother about his fourth familyask questions if need \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude2d",

        "selftext": "So I got into Magic the Gathering about five months ago and have been hooked. I\u2019ve made some friends playing at my local game store, and I\u2019ve learned a lot. Every monday the store hosts a tournament- standard, $5 entry, 3 rounds, winner gets the pot in store credit. I\u2019ve made a few friends there who\u2019ve been playing every week just like me, let\u2019s call them Bob and Dan. Bob has met up with me to play casual matches and such, and we\u2019ve generally gotten along. Bob and Dan, however, are hardcore at this game- where I like to build my own decks, Bob plays tournament winning decks made by pros, and Dan puts every top performing meta card into his deck for a deck thats in total, to buy the singles, the cards cost about $400. (My decks on average cost about $45). They win almost every week- there\u2019s currently a Cowboy Bebop promo where if you win, you get a special cowboy bebop inspired standard card. I saw one of them talking about getting their fourth (of just that 2-month period\u2019s card). They also commented that they play every week with store credit, they never have to shell out $5 to play anymore.I\u2019m not bitter, but I want to win too. I\u2019d like to get one of those cards. And I make my decks with the hopes they\u2019ll be able to compete for it. And I don\u2019t like feeling like new players are just handing their money over to these guys. This week, I finally did it- I went 3-0 with a deck I made. My final match was against Dan, who was a little salty. He complained that I got lucky and that he wasn\u2019t drawing good cards, which does happen fairly often in this game. When i won our best of 3, i was excited because I\u2019d never gone 3-0 before, and I\u2019d really wanted to. I put my hands in the air and said \u201cI did it.\u201d (not loud) and explained that I\u2019d never won a tourney before, so I\u2019m happy to now. I was excited and found friends and told them I finally did it as well. Bob came over and said \u201cI haven\u2019t gone 1-2 in a while, it feels bad\u201d which I responded to with \u201cit doesn\u2019t feel good, does it?\u201d I was mainly just teasing, but to be honest, it feels a bit silly to complain about winning just one match when Bob goes 3-0 about half the weeks he plays. Also, usually, 1-2 or 2-1 is my how well I do. They both left, and I texted Bob after I left, but he hasn\u2019t responded in a few days. I feel bad about the comment I made and I wonder if I celebrated winning a bit too much for their tastes. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s my fault for gloating or if it\u2019s their fault for being egotistical about the game, or if I\u2019m overthinking all of this. Or maybe I care too much about the game. My life has been a little stagnant lately and that\u2019s my fault. TLDR: Celebrated winning a card game tournament, wonder if my behavior doing so is upsetting to others. Edit- I was indeed overthinking. Nobody\u2019s upset with me. I just in the past missed some social cues and have seemed to be good at making people not like me. So i was worried about this. Thanks for ur opinions!",

I have been trying so hard from the very beginning but now, time is running out and we don't even have half of our play. I bring things done from home and show them too my group, everyone doesn't seem to mind except one girl who attacks me (not physically) with every idea or comment I say... for example the other day we were talking about our time and I just commented that maybe we could all have a monologue each (JUST AS AN IDEA) and this girl laughed and said ohhh so 5min each talking without stopping I laughed it off and explained that I didn't mean that because it was too long for our play and that it could be 1min each something like that and immediately after our teacher came to check on us and this girl started laughing and laid she thinks it's okay to have 5min each of non stop talking almost wanting to humiliate me and my IDEAS... I know it doesn't sound like much but u still felt attack beacause it wasn't the first time she did something like that...Yesterday I realised that she had been saying to many people that I was leaving all the work for her and I felt SO hurt because I feel like I'm the one doing most of the work, at least more than her and because I'm new and I really want to cause a good impression and that ruins it I think...And now we are running out of time so I'm just writing the play at home as a backup just in case we don't finish...

        "selftext": "I have lived in a 5bedroom student housing unit with a shared kitchen for the last 3 years. When I moved in I brought a couple of things with me and also bought some new stuff (a dish rack, a really nice second-hand food processor, some plates and mugs and a several cake/bread tins). I have not kept the receipts for these things and never asked any of my roommates to reimburse me for anything but everything has been in the kitchen and available for anyone to use. I have also made sure not to throw away anything that I replaced so that I could take my things and put the old back when I eventually move out. However, the 4 other people who lived here when I moved in have since moved out and been replaced (the first about 2 years ago and the last 6 months ago). I will be moving out soon too and have therefor started to pack my stuff. After taking my things from the kitchen one of my roommates asked about it in our groupchat. I told the truth (that I have taken the things that are mine since I am moving) and several of my roommates got very upset. They either don't believe that the stuff is really mine or they think that it's silly of me to want to keep them since they are used and have been in the kitchen for long enough that they should belong to everyone. I don't want them to feel like I am stealing things but I don't really have any proof to give them. One of them tried to contact the roommate who recently moved out but they have not responded and I have no way to contact the other ex-roommates. So, AITA? Should I just leave everything? It isn't really about money since I'd say it's probably only $100 worth of stuff and I have a job whereas my roommates are all students, but I would like to keep my things. Are there any third options? Edit: Thank you to everyone who's commented, I think I might have just been stressed out bc of the move and overreacted to the situation. I feel much more secure in my decition to just take my stuff! To clarify something that's come up in several comments; there's a bunch of stuff in the kitchen that has been left by earlier tenents/might even have been put here by the student union that owns the place, so it isn't entierly clear if anything belongs to someone unless it's put in the very limited space (a singe shelf) that's been labled with our roomnumbers.",

I try to get him to read a book before he plays video games and or go outside to ride bikes with the neighborhood kids and he just throws a fit my mom is no help at all with teaching him the basics she just gets upset with how he acts in school because she let's him get away with any and everything growing up. I even offer to give him money in exchange  for reading and doing his class work but he just cries and cries until I don't want to do it anymore i get upset and yell at him but nothing mean or degrading i just explain why i want and NEED him to read. Im a little ruff with my brother somtimes but its only when he slaps or hops on my back hes heavy but not fat if that makes sense. I don't like him touching my stuff but that's not only specifically for him only that's for everyone because I feel like i lose things easily and i do get upset a bit and tell him to leave  my room when moving small but important things around.

My friend is getting married next summer, she asked me to be a bridesmaid in her wedding months ago and of course I said yes. Months go by and my friend is planning this wedding, she tells me a week ago that they have decided to get married in Italy. I was happy and excited for her obviously. We talked about the dates, accommodations and everything we needed for this wedding. I discovered that I could not afford to travel for this wedding I told her that I didn't have the money to travel to Italy and she immediately began screaming at me, telling me You agreed to be a part of this wedding so figure it out I explained to her that when we talked about her wedding before she got engaged it was going to be a small wedding in our hometown, now it has turned into something bigger that I just can't afford. She then told me Work more hours or even move back in with your parents so you don't have to pay rent and make it to this wedding. You already agreed to be in this wedding, you can't back out. All my other bridesmaids are coming so why can't you? I felt horrible for it but I told her I had to drop out of being in her wedding as it was expensive to travel, find accommodations, pay for my dress. All of it added up was too much for my budget. She hung up on me and about 10 minutes later her fianc\u00e9 called me and asked me why I was being a horrible friend. Her parents messaged me, along with the rest of her bridal party telling me that I shouldn't have backed out of this wedding and just found a way to get the money necessary for this wedding. I've been feeling like a bit of an asshole about it. So, AITA for dropping out of my friends wedding because I couldn't afford it?",

Some time ago, he confessed that he had feelings for me and i declined. I wasn't ready for a relationship because i worked 2 jobs at the time and barely had time for myself. After that he pestered me a lot about what was he missing and that i was playing the stereotypical 'girls don't want nice guys' agenda. He kept pushing me over and over and guilt tripped me over not giving him a 'proper reason'. I told him that i just didnt want a relationship at the time. I told him to give us some space for his comfort, but he didnt want that, so we didnt explicitly break our friendship, but i still distanced myself a bit. A week ago was his birthday, and i was getting my teeth removed, so very high on meds and i forgot it. I had a long wish written out, and a social media post in my drafts. It's not like i forgot his bday date, i just forgot what date it was in general. My mental clock was lagging badly.  I forgot to wish him on time, and when i realised it had already been a day, so i apologized multiple times, but he just gave me backhanded comments and saying how he didn't have any expectation. Then he said i didnt respect our friendship enough and continued saying how his new friends were way better than me.  I still feel guilty for forgetting his birthday but i also don't think i needed to be humiliated like that. So please be honest here, aita for this?",

        "selftext": "My gf (21f) and I (23M) live together and lately I've been getting a little frustrated with how we handle household chores. I do pretty much everything... all the time. I cook, clean, do dishes, get groceries, you name it. I don't mind doing more, because I genuinely enjoy doing something nice for a partner, but it hurts me that she doesn't reciprocate back. I could make dinner 7 nights in a row, and she'll say no if I ask her to cook us some pasta the next night. Anyways, we had a discussion regarding chores and I expressed my issues. I said I don't mind doing more, but I need something from her. We decided that she would handle sweeping and cleaning the litter boxes. Seems simple enough, but two weeks go by and she doesn't do either, ever. This upset me, so one night when I was heading out and she was staying home, I asked her if she could clean the house. I had a lot going on that day, and didn't get to the chores I normally would. She hesitantly said yes, and did, but the next day she expressed how she didn't feel it was right for me to put it all on her. She says that since I work remote, I have more time to do chores, therefore it should be my responsibility. I was speechless. I normally do nearly everything, every single day Her commute is about 15 minutes, and she works on computers all day, just like me. I get it, I have the privilege of being able to wash some dishes in between work activities, which is why I don't mind doing more, but AITA for not wanting to do everything? It's not like I have ample time before she gets home, many nights I'm still doing chores while she comes home and smokes weed. She even got mad because while I was doing the dishes to cook us dinner, I asked her to get the sponges from her car once she walked in from work. She said I could have texted before she walked in. Sure, but like, I'm about to spend nearly an hour doing stuff for us but you can't take 1 minute to get a sponge? Sorry im ranting a bit, but am I crazy?? **tl;dr**  **My gf said that I should do all the chores because I work remote**",

        "selftext": "Some background: I (29F) used to know Tom (30M) years ago. We were acquaintances as teenagers, and though we briefly dated at 16, it wasn\u2019t serious, and we stayed on neutral terms whenever we ran into each other. A few years later, when we were in our early twenties, I bumped into him at a nightclub, and he introduced me to his then-girlfriend, Alex. From the moment we met, Alex was noticeably cold toward me she barely spoke, made passive-aggressive comments about my appearance, and created an uncomfortable tension. Sensing the awkwardness, I made my exit. Tom later messaged me to apologize for how she acted, but I brushed it off. I didn\u2019t think much of it, as we weren\u2019t close anyway. Since then, I\u2019ve occasionally run into them at different social events, and Alex\u2019s attitude toward me has never changed. She has made snide remarks in passing, whispered about me to others while I was nearby, and has generally gone out of her way to be hostile anytime we\u2019re in the same space. I\u2019ve always ignored it because, as far as I was concerned, whatever problem she had with me wasn\u2019t my issue. Now to last weekend, I was out with some friends when I saw Alex and Tom at the same venue. Tom came over to say hello and make small talk, and almost immediately, Alex stormed over. Without even greeting me, she shoved her ring in my face and made a pointed comment about how I \u201cdefinitely couldn\u2019t have him now.\u201d I laughed and told her I never wanted him in the first place, but I was happy for them. That only made things worse. She started raising her voice, accusing me of trying to get attention for years, making assumptions about me, and throwing out personal insults. When she finally finished, I asked if she was done and told her that I had never done any of the things she was accusing me of. I also made it clear that I didn\u2019t care about her or Tom and, most importantly, that she needed to stop making her personal insecurities my problem. She looked like she was about to respond, so I added that she also needed to stop being jealous of me because there was no reason for it. At that point, she excused herself and left the room, with Tom following after her. Before he left, he told me I didn\u2019t need to say all that. My friends thought my response was blunt but justified, while some mutuals later told me I was too harsh and should have been more understanding because she\u2019s obviously insecure. Now, I\u2019m wondering was I too harsh?",

        "selftext": "I'm (31f) a head teacher at an academy in S.K. I taught here in 2021 & I've been back for 3 months. My 3 US coworkers all came last Aug. Unfortunately, the head teacher before me was a pushover and the other two women (Lucy 27, Cindy 23) asked that I be more assertive since John (late 30s/m) tends to steamroll everyone. In my presentation class we needed to talk about the rubric for their final projects so I needed them to really focus well. John teaches this group the hour before me. Previously he tried to bring very messy snacks to my Lit class. I asked him to please not take snacks to any teachers classes unless you've spoken to them about it. Today he made a bag of popcorn and started putting it in little bowls. Before I went to class I asked him you're not planning on bringing that to my class are you? And he replied with no I'm not. 10min in class the door opens, here he comes with popcorn and the kids go nuts. I tell them no and I follow John back to the door. I say I just asked you if you were bringing it to the class and you said no but you did it anyways. That's so disrespectful. It took a couple min to settle the kids but they didnt grumble about it after I said they can have the snack after class. Class is over, John is out in the hallway giving the kids popcorn and I go to the teachers office. I say to my coworker Lucy, I can't believe he still tried to bring them popcorn when I asked him if he was and he said no to which she responded and why can't they have a snack??. I said first of all, there are signs in all the classrooms that say no eating during class and second, I said no because I needed them to focus on lesson and that should be reason enough. When John came back in the office I asked to speak privately. I told him that it was disrespectful for him to bring snacks when I had already asked if he was and he had said no. His response was I told you no because that bag had gotten kind of burnt and I wanted to make more. I thought you were only asking if I was taking THAT bag of popcorn. I was lowkey floored? We talked 2 weeks ago about not bringing food to classes without asking first and why would I mean that one specific bag of popcorn? He started yelling about how he was just trying to do something nice. I explained to him that I understand that he is doing something kind for the students but he's also not the king of the academy and he can't come into classes in the middle of lesson without asking first. There was a little more back and forth but by the end he said he understood. Now I'm still thinking about it. It was literally just popcorn but it just feels like the principle of the matter? I feel like maybe ITA because I didn't directly say do not bring them snacks because I need to go over really important material at the start of class but usually we finish early so it's okay at the end of class. Lucy's reaction is also making me feel like I over did it.",

        "selftext": "I have a roommate who pays me about 90% of half the rent\u2014so if the total rent is $1,600, they contribute around $700. I cover the rest, along with water, gas, internet, and electricity, because I earn more than they do. When they first moved in, I felt sorry for them because they were leaving an abusive situation. It\u2019s been a little over a year since they moved into my guest room, and overall, it hasn\u2019t been too bad. However, when they moved in, I had some of my belongings in the closet\u2014primarily books. The room is fully furnished with my furniture, including a large bed that takes up a lot of space, a heavy bookshelf, and around 500 books stored in 5\u20136 boxes and two large bags. I always intended to go through them, pick out my favorites, and donate or sell the rest, but due to my ADHD and object impermanence, I kept pushing it off. In the long run, I envisioned turning the room into a closet/library after they moved out since I prefer having my clothes visible rather than stored away. Last year, I came home to find my bookshelf outside by the dumpsters. I immediately told my roommate to put it back in the room because they had no right to throw away my belongings. If they had asked, I would have found another place for it, but I was so frustrated that I insisted they return it to the room without offering an alternative solution. Fast forward to now: I recently hired someone to help clean my apartment when work gets too busy. They offered to organize my cabinets, which reminded me to finally sort through my books\u2014only to be told that my roommate had thrown them all away months ago. Over 500 books\u2014hardcover, paperback, large, small, books I had kept since middle school\u2014just gone. They never asked, never mentioned feeling uncomfortable with them in the closet, never gave me a chance to move them. They simply decided to discard decades of my history without my permission. I was so upset that I haven\u2019t spoken to them in over a week. It\u2019s not just about the books\u2014it\u2019s about the complete lack of respect for my things. My first instinct is to kick them out (yes, I understand the legal complexities of tenancy and eviction), but instead, I\u2019ve decided that I no longer want to cover the bulk of the bills. I\u2019ve drafted a document that evenly splits all household expenses, which will increase their contribution by at least $500. WIBTA if I taped it to their door? This isn\u2019t the arrangement we originally agreed upon when they moved in, but at this point, I feel that if they can blatantly disrespect my belongings, they no longer deserve my generosity. ",

Anyways a couple weeks ago my favorite football team won a game and she get really upset over it. I thought we had moved past it but then all of the sudden stuff went down hill. A couple days later she was texting in a groupchat we were in with another friend i had been sleeping because i worked thirds. She got upset because i hadn\u2019t responded but by the time i had woke up the conversation was over. I tried to just let it go she continued to get upset about me calling one of our other friends and not adding her to the call yet she had just been on the phone with them. I didn\u2019t really talk to her then all of the sudden she had unfriended me on every social media platform and never said a word to me on what exactly i did wrong.The next week i had messaged her asking what was going on and she said that if feels like im her friend but she\u2019s not mine. at this point i was extremely confused because i had not know what was going on bc nothing was every brought up i just wondered why she unfriended me. we got into an argument because she had been pretty disrespectful towards me the last week or so over the littlest things. she had just treated me a little differently ever since the football game situation. She was just saying or doing disrespectful acts, like saying the person i liked was ugly or ignoring me for no reason, or talking about me behind my back to my best friend. Long story short we had talked about it and she ended up telling me that i have called her fat and saying her boyfriend is ugly. She explained that it was okay for her to call a guy i thought was cute ugly but wasn\u2019t okay for me to do so. I never once have i said that she is fat or anything along those lines because i myself struggle with body dysmorphia and know exactly how that feels. I decided to just say me peace and she ended up blocking me on everything without a response. she got really angry that i would not apologize but me and my other friend both agreed that i never said what she is saying i did  So am i the asshole because i didn\u2019t apologize for something i dont remember doing?

        "selftext": "So, I\u2019ll start this by saying my brother and I are 10 years apart. He\u2019s 19 and I\u2019m 29. When I was little, I wanted a sibling and told my parents. My mom was like only if you help out with him - I, being 9 at the time, didn\u2019t realize what that all entailed and said yes. So, fast forward, brother is born, and I\u2019m continuously treated like a 3rd parent. When brother is in HS (sophomore year on) he was super angsty and lashed out a lot. Generally it felt like our relationship was only good if I walked on egg shells. So fast forward, I get married and during that same timeline leading up to the wedding, my mom leaves (during brothers senior year of HS). Sort of out of the blue in terms of she left without conversation but the marriage was not great anyhow. Dad takes full responsibility for brother while mom moves.  Brother graduated and dad decides he wants to go on a \u201cfind himself\u201d road trip. And he basically tells me that I need to take brother in and tells brother I would. Now, brother, who nearly failed out of HS, decides he was to go to community college and then to university so will need support with that. Dad looks to me and says you can do that. Nobody discussed it with me or my husband. I\u2019m reluctant because of how the relationship was slightly toxic at times and also it was sprung on me out of the blue. Also, because since distancing myself from family I realize i felt parentified and I don\u2019t want kids or to be a third parent, I want to be a sister. I also felt like both parents were just saying we\u2019re done, here you go!  I expressed my feelings and brother says I\u2019m abandoning him and basically cussed me out. Dad decides okay he will stay and continue taking care of brother until he gets into university. I\u2019ll mention that dad and brothers relationship is good - dad just said he\u2019s ready to live his life and that\u2019s why he wanted to take this road trip (that had no timeline). So now brother is pissed at me and said I\u2019ve abandoned him (I\u2019ve helped him get school supplies, give him $ every month, and registered him for health insurance and classes) because I wanted our parents to raise and house him vs me. I see his perspective that he felt unwanted and it KILLS me. I have so much guilt. Like for me and my happiness I wanted to focus on my marriage and building my life (married for less than 5 months at this point) but the side of me that loves my brother is like okay I\u2019m a POS. I feel like my parents are constantly putting me in bad situations to be a third parent and it\u2019s damaging my relationship with brother. I guess I need to know AITA for feeling this way and not immediately agreeing to take brother in? Brother thinks I\u2019m the asshole - parents honestly are just like \u201cit is what it is\u201d but I think they think I\u2019m slightly the asshole too. ",

        "selftext": "My husband (M36) and I (F32) have an 18-month-old daughter and a son on the way.  I'm a good wife and easy-going. I've been the breadwinner our entire relationship. I make $250K and pay the majority of our bills. I keep myself in amazing physical shape, work out daily, and still have visible abs 22 weeks into my second pregnancy. I also handle the household responsibilities (cooking/cleaning) and 99% of the childcare (my husband has fed our daughter maybe 2 meals and given her as many baths in her short little life.)  Husband had promised me he was going to make dinner last night. This was a very rare thing and I was excited for it. He calls me 3 hours before he's due home asking if I'd mind if he cooked tomorrow instead so he can go to his buddy's after work. This particular friend is an unmarried and childless pothead which is fine, no judgment. But every time my husband comes back from hanging out with him he is stoned out of his mind. I accept his weed use and don't complain about it (except when he does it in the house because we have a toddler and I'm pregnant) but he comes home half dead after these hang outs.  I honestly tell him I was looking forward to dinner so I'm disappointed and wish I had known earlier but of course he can go.  He gets home around 7 and I wasn't exactly thrilled to see him. We wake up this morning and he tells me he feels unloved and that it's a huge problem that I'm passive aggressive any time he wants to hang out with his friends. To be fair, this is kind of true. We lived in downtown Chicago when we met and I gave up my entire life to move to the middle of nowhere to be by his family. He has tons of friends here and despite my best efforts I only have 1. So I'm lonely, and I miss my old life at times. I told him that he can't expect me to be elated to have him come home all stoned when I have to be sober/pregnant and doing the majority of the household tasks. I told him he could work on catering to me more during pregnancy (I often ask for back rubs and he has never once given me one.)  He freaked out on me, told me this isn't transactional, told me I'm annoying to ask for back rubs and to give it a rest, and then to add insult to injury said my job was easy. Which is funny because if it's so easy it would be great for him to go out and earn the same money that I make as he makes less than half of what I do and I'm real tired of being the provider and the homemaker.   Anyway, this is when I tell him that grown men with kids do not go get stoned with their buddies after work. They come home and be with their families.  Apparently this was so egregious he left for the day without saying goodbye. He acts like I prevent him from having any friends which isn't true. I always encourage him to see his friends and go on trips and on and on. But I will admit that I can be passive aggressive about it just because I don't ever get to do the same kinds of things.  I am so curious to know, AITA? ",

        "selftext": "I (34f) received a text from my brother (30m) asking if I had time to chat, this message made me extremely anxious, as it is unlike him, but I was at work so replied that I would call him after I finished work. For context about 3 years ago our dad took his life and I received a call at work telling me I needed to come home, so now vague messages or calls from my family of this sort can be extremely distressing. I did try and call him before I finished work as I was very worried but he wouldn't tell me what was going on, he just seemed very upset and said we'd talk later. I said it wasn't fair of him to do that and he needed to tell me what was going on and he hung up on me. I sent a message and said if he didn't call me back I would send my husband around to check on him but he said he wasn't home so I asked where he was and he said he was driving home from work. I tried calling him again after work and at first he didn't answer but then on my second call he answered and I asked where he was and what was going on, he gave me one word answers telling me where he was but wouldn't tell me what was going on and why he was upset or why he had messaged me asking to talk. I was getting very worried and upset and drove round to his house to wait for him to get home. I stayed in my car and when he saw my car he must have avoided coming home and messaged me telling me to go home and said that he hadn't done anything wrong, and I was guilt tripping him when he was struggling. I replied that if he didn't want to talk now that was okay but I wanted to know he was home safe, that I would stay in my car but I wanted to know when we would be talking about what was going on. I saw his car drive up the driveway and after waiting for a while I drove home, he seemed to still be sitting in his car. I haven't heard anything from him yet but I did get a call from my mum (she normally lives with my brother but is away at the moment), my brother had also tried to call her but she had been busy and missed the call and when she tried to call him back he hadn't answered. I told her what had happened and she said he might have lost his job because earlier in the week he had been told that 15% of the staff would be cut. While I understand this would be very stressful, I don't understand why he couldn\u2019t just tell me what had happened and had to cause me so much worry. He is still living at home with my mum and he has savings so losing his job (if that is what has happened) is not going to lead to him being homeless or unable to pay for things. I later heard from my mum that she had got a message from my brother and he still doesn't want to talk but we know he's ok. Am I being self-centred for being upset with how he's handled this? Am I guilt tripping him by telling him he can't message me telling me he needs to talk and then not talking to me? I'm honestly so mad at him but am I just making it all about me when he's the one who's going through a tough time? Am I the asshole?",

He requested I send links to things I want because he isn\u2019t creative to know what I want. He likes when I just tell him things \u2014 clear and direct. If I do not ask for a gift (birthday, Christmas, etc) I\u2019m not receiving anything. This happened in 2024. He asked me to pick an engagement ring out because he just couldn\u2019t decide. He TOLD ME HE WOULD BUY THIS NECKLACE 2 years ago, and I\u2019ve waited this long. I sent links, photos, we have walked through pandora together to see what it is I wanted. We are in couples counseling to work on communication and putting in effort since he struggles with it. He\u2019s well aware he struggles with this. So for everyone telling me to just buy it myself, it defeats the purpose of him saying he will buy it and requesting links to what I want. I thought about buying it myself for quite a while, but I have waited patiently for him to put in the effort and keep his word.  My husband (28m) and I(29f) have been married nearly a year now, and our anniversary is coming up soon. Ever since we have dated I have expressed how I\u2019d love a dainty initial necklace with the letter d to wear daily. Corny? Sure, but I love it. Anyway\u2026after a year of not receiving the necklace I started showing him pictures on Etsy of the ones I love (small gold plates with a lower case d in typewriter font \u2014 all of them were this font and style) we even walked through pandora to the custom engraved section and how he could write it and that would be very precious and meaningful to me. He thought it was neat and this whole time I thought he was absorbing what I was saying and listening. All he absorbed was the word \u2018dainty\u2019 apparently. This comes down to this morning. He expressed he was bored at work (night shift and he works for weeks at a time 1000 miles away from me). And this morning he bought a small (in size) but very thick bulky d necklace is some kind of frilly cursive that doesn\u2019t even look like a d. We share an email and I had literally opened it to check our daily emails like I do daily and it refreshed and there was the purchase. I texted him and expressed that it\u2019s absolutely nothing like I\u2019ve expressed for years. I\u2019ve waited this long for a necklace \u2014 I want to actually like and wear it. He told me I wanted dainty and that it is dainty, and I tried to explain dainty and delicate doesn\u2019t just mean in size and he googled it sent me the definition of dainty. I told him it was absolutely nothing like I\u2019ve shown him for years and to just cancel the order. Naturally this makes me ungrateful in his eyes. AITAH?",

So I have these three friends, That i'll call Victoria, Molly and Maria. I've been best friends with Maria since 1st grade, and i've known Victoria and Molly since 4th grade. A few weeks ago, me and my friend Molly were just joking around about the topics we'd talk about to each other, when she suddenly brought up that her and Maria had been talking about some big secret all about me. I asked what it was, since i was curios of what big secret was going on about me. She said that Maria had been feeling a lot like my friend, Victoria, completely took me over, and that we're leaving her out. Molly said Maria had gone so far as to befriend my friend i've had since kindergarten (let's call her Bella) just to make me jealous and spend more time with Maria. I was immediately shocked that she'd try to make me jealous and that she felt that way, since yes, me and Victoria have been together a lot, but Maria was almost always with us when me and Victoria were together. Molly told me not to tell Maria, since it could ruin our friendship. I agreed and kept quiet. In class, i tried to be more with Maria to show her that i still value our friendship, but deep down i felt like a complete asshole for making Maria feel that way. Fast forward 2 weeks later, Me, Victoria, Maria and another friend are working on a group project. Victoria gets stressed because only me and her are doing anything. Victoria tells Maria to stop messing around and do something productive, to which Maria gets annoyed and asks her what she should do. Victoria gets angry and stops responding to her. Right when we go to present the project, Maria pulls me aside to tell me that she feels like me and Victoria are leaving her out. I've been sick, so i haven't spoken to her since.

        "selftext": "I(f27) came to Russia to my sister home (500mq) with my Italian partner(m29) for 2 months and a half. We opened a tourist visa for 3 months since we couldn't apply for less time. Because of that we wanted to spend as much as time as possible with my family since I didn't see the for 4 years.While booking the ticket she said that it was ok for us to come for so long and we didn't speak about money. In this house they live my parents(f65, m57), my sister(F40), her husband(M40), their teenager(M12) and their kid(f2).  The teenager is giving problems with his behavior as he doesn't want to do homework, being disrespectful towards the grands, not helping anyhow in home. My sister's husband works so much that he just comes home to sleep so my sister is responsible for the education of the little ones but since the personality of the teenager is stronger that my sister one he just doesn't listen to her and does what he wants. He is also disrespectful towards my parents and they obviously want to help her in the matter of her education but she doesn't want because she is proud, don't want anyone besides her or the father to have authority to him, don't want anyone to even touch him.  So this created such conflict that time by time my parents even left the house to go back to their one leaving them alone.  But my sister cannot manage such house (cooking, staying with the little one, cleaning, in the summer tend to the massive garden, electrical/gas/plumbing possible issues) so she prayed them to come back.  In this whole situation we came and my sister says that we make her feel uncomfortable with our presence after 2 months whenever she shouts to her teenager.  Also she wanted us to help with the grocery money on which we agreed but she didn't specify when and how. Just expecting us to hand money every time I think. Plus she spoke about money just to me not my partner who holds all our money since I don't work. So at the end we just gave money whenever she asked (again to me!?) And on top of that she explained to my partner that they are struggling now, many debts in order to make him feel pity and I think give her more money for the groceries. Plus we came from Italy by 2 flights landing in Russian city far away from sisters home. From there she picked up with my father by car(14 hrs driving). Now they want us to go alone by 2 trains to that city. Train where they control people's documents and belongings for security.14 hrs back and forth it's a long driving time but they are 2 and I came first time after 4 years and gos know when I'll come back. I told her that it's gonna be uncomfortable for us since I don't speak Russian well and I'm gonna be with a foreigner by she replied that we are grown up. Now she is making jokes that we can go by foot. Now we have to leave in a week.  Since culturally we are different (in Italy people tent to be really specific with money and are more guest welcoming) aita?",

        "selftext": "Me (18M) and my friend (25M) are moving to a cheaper place next week and plan to stay there for three more years until we graduate from university. We live in a very small town- about 5000 inhabitants- that has a LOT of stray dogs, people unfortunately take them to the campus\u2019s farm and abandon them as puppies. Recently two more pups were found in campus, so we talked about it and adopting one of them didn\u2019t seem like a bad idea, our new house has a fairly big garden space and one small dog is easy enough to take around if after graduating we decide to move into a bigger city. Well\u2026 turns out this other girl, let\u2019s call her Jane, has been posting around photos of the abandoned puppies and making go funds me to take them to a vet and castrate them, and we told her that we\u2019d be taking one of them home, for her not to worry. It was fine for a day, until I received a message from Jane saying she took both of them to her house (she has 7 stray dogs that are sick and decided to take in two puppies) until we moved to the new house. I found it weird, because well\u2026 why was she doing that? But I decided to donate a hundred bucks for her to get some dog food and keep them until next week. I made it very clear which one of them we would take and that we preferred to take her to the vet ourselves.Some time passed and she just texted my friend \u201chey, would you be upset if I donated both of the puppies to my friend? I don\u2019t want to separate them since they\u2019re siblings\u201d and tried to guilt trip him into either adopting both or none. For context: he\u2019s autistic and cares a lot about animals, so when she did that he agreed to take in both.Fast forward to today, I just discovered all of that, that we would be taking both, and also that she got 500 bucks in debt with the local vet because she decided to take both of them and said WE would pay for both consults, meds and surgeries. I got very upset that we\u2019re now in debt with the vet, for two dogs we haven\u2019t even adopted yet for a bunch of stuff they didn\u2019t even need in the first place and that I wasn\u2019t aware of. I messaged her to try and understand what was she doing, she cursed a lot and basically told me to never direct a word at her again.I don\u2019t want anything to do with this situation anymore and my friend also agrees this is out of hand. I feel really bad that we told her we\u2019d take a dog and she spent a lot of money and time and effort, but I never asked her help in any way, she just jumped in as an adoption manager and invented a bunch of problems as if she was elected responsible for all the abandoned dogs in the city.  AITA for not wanting anything to do with this anymore and giving up on adopting one of them? ",

        "selftext": "I (18F) live with my dad\u2019s family, which includes his younger sister, younger brother, and his mom (my grandmother). My grandma has always been a nightmare to my mom. She constantly orders her around, making her do all the household chores\u2014cooking, receiving packages, cleaning, basically everything\u2014while never asking her own kids to do anything. On top of that, my mom is expected to think of what to cook for my grandma every day, and if she doesn\u2019t pick the perfect meal, my grandma either whines, refuses to eat, or says she\u2019s not hungry anymore. My dad works a lot, and I\u2019ve tried to tell him that his mom treats my mom like a servant, but he just neglects the issue. He doesn\u2019t outright deny it, but he acts like he doesn\u2019t see it happening. I think part of it is because my dad is the eldest son, so he has this weird soft spot for his mom. But at the same time, he\u2019s not doing anything to fix the situation, so my mom just has to deal with it. Tonight, my grandma (who is disabled) asked me to help her up the stairs. She doesn\u2019t need physical assistance, just for someone to stand behind her to make sure she doesn\u2019t tip over. I was busy, so I told my little cousin to do it instead. But honestly, even if I wasn\u2019t busy, I don\u2019t want to help someone who has treated my mom like garbage for years. My mom is physically and mentally exhausted, and it pisses me off that we have to live with my dad\u2019s family when we\u2019re not even well off financially. They\u2019re slowing us down economically, which means my mom doesn\u2019t even get to take proper breaks or vacations. It\u2019s painful to watch. After I told my cousin to help, my grandma started whining to my uncle, complaining that I \u201cpassed my responsibility\u201d onto my cousin instead of doing it myself. And this is just one example\u2014whenever we don\u2019t do exactly what she tells us to, she whines to her kids instead of actually asking them for help. Instead of telling her own children to step up, she just complains to them about how no one is listening to her, which is ironic because she never actually expects them to do anything. edit; thank you so much for the motivating words! i told my mom about this post and it made her giggle fr hahaha. i don\u2019t think she would\u2019ve expected me to write about this or for it to even reach a lot of people. thank you guys, i\u2019ll try all your suggestions and so will my mom! if we can\u2019t get out, i hope at least we can make this house a better place and less toxic. i also wish all the best to everyone, especially those in the same situation. \ud83d\udc96",

        "selftext": "Hey! So I 21, my bestfriend / flatmate 21F, and our mutual friend 21M were sitting around last night watching some TV on my laptop. Last month, I dropped my phone on my screen and it broke the display, and I had to pay \u00a3270 ($335) to get it replaced with a refurbished screen. To replace it with a new screen would\u2019ve been around \u00a3550 ($680). I\u2019m a student who\u2019s only just started working part time and absolutely could not afford 550, so I chose the refurbished option. Now, last night, my best friend moved my laptop by the screen, and cracked the display. The whole display wasn\u2019t working for around 5 minutes after she did it, and once it turned back on it has a thumb print shaped black hole, a crack, and massive lines across both edges. I didn\u2019t see her do it, it was just her and our friend\u2019s gasp that made me look up.  She was not at all apologetic, she was laughing the whole time. I kept saying it wasn\u2019t funny, and she kept laughing - going to the extent of hiding her face in her clothes to cover up that she was still laughing. She never apologised, and I acted cold with her until our friend left about an hour later because of how mad I was. She just went to bed and didn\u2019t say anything. I know she didn\u2019t \u2018do\u2019 anything and it was likely the old refurbished screen, but it realistically wouldn\u2019t have happened if she didn\u2019t grab it. She hasn\u2019t offered to pay or even apologised for doing anything. She texted me later that night and apologised for laughing, saying it probably made me feel worse and came across insensitive, but still no apology for actually breaking it / any offer to pay anything.  I\u2019m going to speak to the repair guy today and see if he could potentially fix it for free or a reduced rate / if it was a mistake with his installation or the screen or something AITA if I ask her to pay? I know it\u2019s petty but it wouldn\u2019t have happened without her grabbing it - she cracked my display. EDIT:Thank you for all the replies basically confirming what I believe she should do\ud83d\ude2d I asked her and she sent me a 9 minute long voice note about how she won\u2019t be paying me back. She\u2019s \u2019touched hers and her boyfriends laptops\u2019 in the same way and it\u2019s never done that before, she then claimed it was falling off the edge of the sofa (onto a pillow) and she went to catch it, and then doubled down on how she has no money and can\u2019t afford to. The last point is understandable but stleast offer to pay me back? I also can\u2019t afford it? I feel like this is an insane interaction. I also just had a class with her in which she ignored me and ran out of the room as soon as she could after. I don\u2019t know what to do, I hate arguing with her because she gets nasty, personal and mean, and we live alone just the two of us so it\u2019s awkward. I always end up rolling over and apologising. ",

        "selftext": "Im a pretty young female, and me and my sister live across the US from eachother. This summer I went to visit her and my mom, whom I hadn't seen in about 2 years. I was supposed to stay there from the middle of June until the beginning of July. Now, about 2-3 months prior, I had dislocated my knee and landed on said knee while falling. I also had to sit screaming for help in that position for almost 30 minutes, and then had to wait an extra 15 for my dean to finally come to my room and get me to the hospital--where they told me I had fractured something, I dont really know what, but it was small enough to where it could heal on its own without surgery. At my grandma's she has this huge case of stairs, which im scared to go down due to how unsafe they feel--since they have huge gaps and im scared of falling--but especially since I had just stopped using the cast I had on, my knee sometimes hurt when put under pressure when walking down stairs, running, etc. \u00a0After about 3-4 weeks, I got homesick and decided I would go back early. I wasn't really feeling any semblance of joy based on the past experiences with this side of my family, and it didn't seem like they had changed at all. So, about 4 days after that, I was driving with my grandparents and sister to the airport. I waved my sister and grandma goodbye (grandpa stayed in the car) and was on my merry way. However, while waiting for boarding time, my heart sunk. My sister texted me a video, which I listened to--showing how my grandma was saying in explicit detail how much weight I had gained since they last saw me, and how all that weight must have been why my knee was hurting so much, even though i had stated many times that I had dislocated my knee. I fully went up and texted her, going on a long rant about why she would say things like that behind my back and she couldn't be talking, seeing that she would constantly complain on how big she was. A few minutes later, she saw it--responding basically blaming everything on my sister, and how she shouldnt have told me lies and she was trying to ruin the family by spouting a bunch of BS. I told her that I saw video proof, where she again tried to blame my sister. My sister texted me that my grandma was yelling at her, and honestly I felt even worse. I failed to realize that this would probably effect her standing with our grandma. However we talked it out and she seemed to not care about it because she doesnt wanna be around someone who talks to me like that anyways. My mom also texted me, telling me about how I shouldnt have said anything and shouldve let it go. However, I dont think I shouldve. My grandma has a history about talking to people like this, constantly belittling others and trying to make herself feel good. I thought it was time somebody tell her back on it. So reddit, AITA for telling off my grandma when she told my sister the reason my knee hurt was because of all the extra weight I had on me?? ",

        "selftext": "Hello Reddit universe, first post. Let\u2019s get into it. I (38 M) have a girlfriend (Bonni) with a 13-year old son, and they live in a house with her sister. Her sister has a boyfriend, Dude, who comes around but doesn\u2019t live there. He normally carries a pistol on him. I haven\u2019t known him long, but he seems like a nice guy and we typically get along. He has seemed responsible with his guns which I appreciate, especially with kids around. I\u2019ve been around firearms my whole life and take gun safety seriously. The other night Bonni, her son and I get home to an empty house and as we are getting ready for dinner, she notices a small fanny pack on the kitchen table that doesn\u2019t belong to us. She moves it, notices it\u2019s heavy and asks me if I think there\u2019s gun in there. She handed it over and it was pretty obvious that\u2019s what it was. Knowing he likes to practice concealed carry, I wondered if it was loaded and ready to fire. So I unzipped the bag and took a look. I wanted to make sure Dude at least left it in relatively \u2018safe\u2019 condition. Thought about just moving it, but I really wanted to know the exact situation that was left unattended on the kitchen table.  What I found was a loaded Glock 9mm with a round in the chamber and ready to fire. It was holstered, but being a Glock, there is no traditional \u2018safety\u2019 on the gun and anyone could just pull it out and fire off a round. So I dropped out the magazine, cleared the round from the chamber, and put it back in his bag in a much safer condition than I found it.  I then text him telling him I did that, and let\u2019s make sure that doesn\u2019t happen again. He then calls me NOT to apologize, but to tell me how pissed off he is that I violated his privacy. A day later thought he\u2019d come to his senses but I hear that he is still livid and that I should apologize, although I have not heard a single bit of remorse or apology from him to Bonni for leaving an unsecured, loaded gun sitting out for anyone to get at.  In my mind, the safety of everyone in the house, especially the kid, is priority #1 and should far outweigh anyone\u2019s feelings of privacy violation. No, I wouldn\u2019t be stoked if someone in general decided to open and look in my bag. But if I were to make the huge mistake of leaving a loaded gun in a common area where a kid lives, if anything I\u2019d hope that someone responsible would do the same thing I did, make the situation safer, and help prevent any chance of my mistake becoming something much worse.  AITA for prioritizing this safety concern over Dude\u2019s privacy? UPDATE: To be fair I missed a detail - turns out he had given the gun to Bonni\u2019s sister to take with them to lock up, and she left it on the table on accident. ",

        "selftext": "I (18f) moved away from my family in 2023 for studies. I\u2019ll be finished this year, and afterwards I am planing to stay here for studies. The place i am renting is only for duration of my studies. My cousin (f18) studies in a different place but wants to move here after studies. And my other cousin (m16) as well. So, this brought up the idea from my family. That two of my cousins can all move together to one apartment. I refused for a couple of reasons.  1. My cousin (f18) is involved with a lot of boys despite her parents being against it. In one occasion she sneaked out with her bf (now ex) during an important family function. The whole extended family somehow blamed me for it, even though i tried to stop her from doing it and even defending her. She also threw me under the bus, so even after years they still bring it up and blame me. Also i got scolded right there and then. This really changed how i see my family, and thats also one of the reasons i moved so far away even though i had the choice to not.  2. She again used my name to get out of meeting up with another bf. She wasnt caught but i felt really betrayed. In case they get caught i have no doubt that i will be blamed.  3. The family plays favorites with her. I have no problem with this, as my mom and dad loves me a lot but in some occasions it makes me sad. I struggle with mental health already and i think that it will make it worse.  I know that this is objectively a good, great idea even. Its a lot better to share rent and live with people who i already know. We are still close despite what happened, but living with someone i know is way better than a stranger.  But i am putting all that aside just for my mental health and its selfish of me. My mom and her mom and dad are both really adamant on this decision, and called me ridiculous for not wanting to do it. My mom called me and said that its because i hate her, but i really dont. My dad also doesnt want me to move in with her, because he knows that how much that affected me.  ",

        "selftext": "so I have this friend let\u2019s call her Taylor, Taylor has an older sister that is disabled and their family is very humorous about it and I\u2019ve heard her make jokes about her sister before which is obviously okay. I was in class with a group of people and these people have a darker sense of humour and the topic of Taylor\u2019s sister came up and i made a comment in response to another friends comment that was slightly out of line in joking way but I genuinely had no bad intentions as I am close friends with her but I also felt bad because I shouldn\u2019t have said it. Fast forward a while later me and Taylor get closer and start sitting with a group at lunch and felt uncomfortable being close with her knowing I had said something like that so a topic came up and I mentioned I made a comment that was about her sister and apologised and it wasn\u2019t a huge thing as far as I remember she didn\u2019t ask any further like what the joke was and we kind of laughed it off. I was in class today and the topic of the joke came up and they said \u201coh atleast she doesn\u2019t know\u201d and I explained that I had told her seeing as I was the one who made the joke and they were really shocked and seemed worried, they were like \u201cI can\u2019t believe you told her\u201d and I explained that I didn\u2019t mention them it was purely me clearing the air and they think I shouldn\u2019t have said anything but i didn\u2019t feel right being close with Taylor and not saying anything. I realise I\u2019m an asshole for making the joke but I stuck to my morals by telling her and I was made to feel bad now by the group and im not sure. ",

        "selftext": " I'm having my house renovated by our landlord and though I can stay there it's uncomfortable because there are people there all the time, so my boyfriend and I are pretty much living together for the past few months. When he was trying to find an apartment in the city because he had a shitty roommate, and didn't feel cool at his place I let him crash with me for a few months too. It was difficult for a bit because his sleeps do not match mine at all and he has a lot of mood swings and bouts of depression so I need to be a lot more available and supportive because I was with him for all his worse moments instead of him being able to calm down and regulate by himself when in moods we maybe wouldn't show other people. This seemed fair as I have my own issues and like I said I'm very in love with this person so I'm trying not to feel guilty about being in his space so much because he makes it clear he wants me here and wants me to feel safe. Now that we're living together tho every time a friend of his stays over I go to my own place to give them privacy and that means that with enough notice I can pack some things and organize my week differently. (My commute to work, my groceries,...) (The now) My boyfriend has been acting manic and erratic the last few days, every time I wake up he's moving things around saying he feels crushed by all the things around him that it causes him distress to see things messy. Sometimes the room is fully clean but there's a piece of furniture or wall decorations that HAVE TO GO. He doesn't expect me to help him do all of this but he's doing these manic tasks sometimes at 4 or 5 in the morning while I'm sleeping and sometimes I can get a little overwhelmed even though I know it's not his fault he just feels things intensely  Today we had a dinner booked with friends we meet every few weeks, we had already missed our last few meet ups because he cancelled last minute and this is often the case because he wakes up around dinner time. Then he said he wasn\u2019t going again, he woke up super late and was nitpicking things to do in the house. I begged him to come with me and please think of it do something else but it was pointless. I left the house upset said I would go myself and set a boundary with myself that I wasn't going to cancel something I wanted to do to relax to help him manage a tantrum. After I left he invited a friend over to help, the friend was late and he ended up doing a lot of heavy lifting himself. He texted me and said the friend was staying over so he could stay later which meant I would have to plan out my next day with little notice. I came to meet them we had a few drinks I helped them with the last stuff and started to get super tired but his friend had gotten into bed because he was cold and they were watching movies together now.. He made up the couch for me and said I looked and was acting weird but didn't know how to respond. AITA that this is hurtful? How to I talk about it?",

        "selftext": "Me (40's F), have been worried about skin issues on my dad's (70's) face.  He has had a dark spot on his cheek that keeps larger and larger. Every time I see him, I mention that he should go and see a dermatologist and get checked out (It's been YEARS I've asked him to do so).  My mom has also tried to make him appts and he has canceled/not gone. I just got checked by a dermatologist and had to have a spot treated on my face so I decided enough is enough. I asked my mom to send me his insurance information which she quickly did. I looked up his coverage & found a Dr. nearby. I then called my dad to tell him that I was setting an appointment up. We had already been texting about it so he wasn't blind-sighted on what I was up to. When talking he wanted to change the subject & tried to distract me etc.  but I persisted and gave him some avail dates/times.  When he finally relented on a day/time (which I think was only to shut me up), I scheduled the appointment and sent him the details and also put a reminder on his calendar. However, I feel bad that I had to bully him into it.  I honestly don't even know if he will end up going in the end. I know that I wouldn't like being told what to do, but I just want what is best for him. I think he is scared of what they may find or need to do (which I completely understand- as drs can be scary). We all just want to make sure that he is healthy and there are no underlying cancer issues. So AITA? EDIT: I would go with him but I live in a different state. So I may need to ask a sibling who does live close and/or my mom to go & be with him. Update #1: My dad is not upset with me for making this appointment and he told me he called the office and confirmed with them (Step 1).  Now to wait and see if we keeps it and goes (Step 2). But progress!",

They had already booked to go together before I even agreed to go, and were happy to split the cost between the two of them. They then asked if I would want to go (this MORNING) and I said yes at the time because I didn't really think it through and it was a spontaneous decision. They called me tonight and we booked train tickets, and the hotel is payable when we arrive but we said we would just split the cost after. They talked about what they plan on doing whilst there and it's a big weekend of clubbing and drinking and after thinking about it I've decided that I just really don't want to go- I'm not in the position to be spending lots of money and partying just isn't my scene anymore. I've cancelled on the last few weekends out too because I haven't wanted to party hard and they just don't understand and have got really angry at me for being flakey and now saying they're left with having to pay for the hotel. Should I just suck it up and go given that I'm young and should just enjoy myself- or go with my instinct and have the weekend in like I enjoy?   To clarify: They were going regardless. They decided and booked the hotel BEFORE i was involved. they asked me, i said yes which was a rushed decision. On our call- they said they wanted to party really hard and i dont. that made me rethink- and since i've been stressed about that and money. The train tickets have nothing to do with me dropping out, they have their own tickets and like i said..they were going in the first place as just the 2 of them!",

Get up rubbing my eyes and check the hatch which is closed, no ladder present below hatch means no one got in there from the hatch. I put my ladder there and check the attic, empty. Hear something running on the roof at this point, prolly a cat. Get down, SO is panicking asking what I saw, tell her nothing in the attic, something maybe on the roof. She  wants to call the cops and is asking a 100 questions. Ask her to wait while I check it out to settle her down. I circle the house twice while shining a bright torch over the roof. Don't see anything there. Get inside house and explain I went around the house twice shining the torch on the roof. There is no one there. But I am bombarded with 'who was it then'? No one. 'who could it have been?' no one was there . 'what were they doing on the roof' I don't even know if someone was there. 'how could they have gotten up there' I don't know. 'how do you not know, take a guess' I don't think anyone was there, probably a cat running around.

He was initially a gift from my mom and her boyfriend to my sister-in-law (SIL) when he was just a tiny kitten. My brother and SIL lived with me then in our shared apartment. However, they leave Mikey behind when they decide to move out and find their own place. I took it upon myself to look after him. I've been responsible for all his needs, from feeding him to taking him to the vet and buying litter. Lately, I've realized that my sister-in-law treats Mikey as if he still belongs to her, even though she has shown little interest in or care for him since they moved out. She never checks in on him or contributes financially to his care, which I find frustrating. My brother and SIL argue that it doesn't matter who cares for the cat because my mom gifted Mikey to my sister-in-law. They believe that since she was the one who received him, she has a right to call him her cat. However, it's unfair for her to claim ownership of Mikey when she has abandoned him and doesn't participate in his care. Compounding the issue, my brother and sister-in-law are planning to move into a new place that doesn't allow pets, which means they would be unable to take Mikey with them regardless. Given this situation, I feel justified in asserting that Mikey is my cat since I am the one taking care of him. So, AITA for referring to Mikey as my cat?",

She ran away when she was 14, and has been couch surfing/staying with her mom (who I don\u2019t know much about)/living at a group home since then. She didn\u2019t see her dad much at all in that time, maybe once a month for a few minutes so he could give her money. Past that she refused to see him entirely. For the last few weeks she\u2019s started coming to our house almost every day.  I don\u2019t mind her coming over, I would hope that her and her dad would have a good relationship and see each other. This issue is we all smoke weed. The daughter smokes weed as well, and I have conflicting opinions on that, I was a huge stoner (among many other things) as a teenager and know that telling a teen that\u2019s already into that kind of thing what to do doesn\u2019t work. It didn\u2019t work on me and I\u2019m sure it wouldn\u2019t work on the daughter. She\u2019s gonna do what she\u2019s gonna do and I\u2019m not her parent so I\u2019m not one to tell her what to do anyway. But roommate will actively get high with his underage daughter (and her friends!!) in our house, and it makes me DEEPLY uncomfortable. When she\u2019s here I just keep to my room, because in my opinion it\u2019s incredibly inappropriate to do things like that with a child and I don\u2019t want to be around it. When I try to talk to roommate about it he just laughs it off and won\u2019t engage with the conversation. I don\u2019t know how to get it through his head that it\u2019s not okay to get a kid high (especially ones that aren\u2019t yours!!!). It bothers me even more because I\u2019m on (unsupervised) parole and if anything were to happen and police found out what he was doing that I could be implicated or associated with it and they would take me back to jail.  I might be TA because this is the first time in a long time his daughter has been willing to spend any time with him, and I\u2019d hate to get in the way of them having a friendly relationship (and I firmly believe he is not capable of having a parental relationship with her, mostly because of who he is as a person but also because I don\u2019t think she would allow for it and would disappear again) She has asked why I don\u2019t hang out with them when she\u2019s over (I\u2019m the only woman in the house and I can tell she wants me to like her, and I do! I just cannot be around that) I\u2019ve made excuses about not feeling good, etc. because I don\u2019t want to badmouth her dad to her but I\u2019m 3 seconds away from saying \u201cbecause I respect you enough as a person and a child to not behave like that around you, and because there\u2019s something deeply wrong with adults who will partake with children\u201d the next time she asks. I\u2019m not sure what to do here, I don\u2019t want to be the reason they have no relationship, she\u2019s not my kid so I have no say over what she does (and neither do her actual parents it seems), but this puts me at risk and when I tell the roommate that he does not listen.

        "selftext": "Sorry if this is long or confusing, I\u2019ve never used Reddit before. I (26F) have been having an issue with my cousin \u201cEmma\u201d (29F) that has gotten the whole family involved, and I need some outside perspective. Our grandfather hadn\u2019t been in great health the past few years, and over the past month or two he\u2019d really gone downhill. He was admitted to the hospital a couple of weeks ago in full-on kidney failure. We\u2019d known this was coming- about a year ago a doctor had told us his kidney function was really poor and since he decided not to do dialysis, he had maybe a year left to live (turns out that doctor was exactly right). I\u2019d been to visit him in the hospital a few evenings after work, and it was rough; he wasn\u2019t too coherent and I knew there wasn\u2019t much they could do. It was sad but not really unexpected; he was 85 and like I said, health had been bad for a while.  Anyway, Emma\u2019s job doesn\u2019t have a typical 9-5 schedule, so it\u2019s easier for her to visit him at the hospital in the mornings. A few days ago I was at work when, at about 10 am, I checked Facebook on my phone. The first thing I saw was a long post from Emma announcing that our grandfather had died. Needless to say, that was NOT the way I wanted to find out. I commented telling Emma that it was wrong to post this without first making sure the whole family knew, and she should take the post down.  Just a few minutes later my father texted asking me to call him, and when I did he told me what I already knew. Turns out Emma had made her Facebook post less than an hour after he died, when there were still a lot of family members that didn\u2019t know. I wasn\u2019t the only one who found out via that post, and none of us were too happy about it. A couple of days later my uncle (Emma\u2019s dad) told me he\u2019d specifically told Emma to wait until she knew family had been notified before posting anything (we all know how obsessed with social media she is). He was livid when he learned she\u2019d posted about it so quickly despite him telling her not to. At the memorial service Emma confronted me, saying I\u2019d \u201cembarrassed\u201d her by making my comment on her Facebook post. Apparently some of her friends had seen my comment and agreed that it had been wrong of her to post the news so quickly. A lot of people are mad at her for it, and she\u2019s claiming that I \u201cturned friends and family against her\u201d by calling her out in my comment. This has just added a bunch of extra stress to an already tough situation, and I really want an outside opinion on if making the comment was wrong. ",

        "selftext": "AITA for asking a guy to pay for my babysitter a little context I am a single mom I have been a single mom for 2 years now I just now got back in to dating I've been on a few days so far but this one guy I met on a dating app wanted to go out on a weekday after work to get drinks and dinner I politely let him know that I could not do that because after work I had my kid at home and I did not have money for a babysitter until Friday he kept insisting not asking but insisting that I had to go out with him on this day if we wanted to meet in person so again I politely told him I cannot go that day because I cannot afford a babysitter until I get paid on Friday so if you have to meet that day either you can pay for the babysitter or we will not meet and I will just move on and find someone else so am I the AITA for that? Now he has been blowing up my phone saying it was rude that I would even ask for him to pay for the babysitter and if he didn't I wouldn't go out with him and I again explain to him that I do not have money for a babysitter so either we cannot go out that night and since he said if I didn't go out with him that night we wouldn't talk anymore then I'd be okay not talking to him or he could pay for the babysitter and we could go out but now I don't have any plans on going out with him anyway even if he offers to pay now I don't want to go out with someone like thatUpdate: I just posted this not that long ago but I have already got so many messages saying that I am in the right but from some of the comments I want to clarify that I did stop talking to this guy but before I blocked him on the dating site we were talking on I did clarify with him why I wouldn't not be interested on seeing him I also want to clarify that I never ask other people to pay for my babysitter because I am the mom and I am responsible for my child but for people who can only meet on certain days I understand that and usually we don't talk after that but this guy was so insistent that I did block him on the dating site I just want to make sure I was the a-hole for blocking him for this situation because I am new to dating again I was married to my child's dad for a few years and I met him and started dating him when I was 14 years old so I'm really new to the stating stuff and so I knew it was red flags when this guy was insisting that it had to be that day but I just wanted to make sure I was not the a-hole for blocking him because of this situation",

I begged her to tell me what\u2019s wrong and she spews out that I\u2019m not the daughter she\u2019d hoped for and that I\u2019m a big disappointment. She said I\u2019m too \u201cwild\u201d and lost my track. I\u2019m currently at my boyfriend\u2019s house right now because being in their house has been so horrific. She said I\u2019m wild because I return home around 10 pm and leave in the morning around 7 am. Well the thing is I wouldn\u2019t leave the house if her and her husband didn\u2019t act like my existence was toxic. It\u2019s so uncomfortable in the house so I just leave. They\u2019re mad at me because I couldn\u2019t get a nice job with my English bachelors. I did \u201cwaste\u201d a year trying to find qualified jobs that\u2019d help out but it was to no avail. So I\u2019m going back to school this spring to get my masters in education. She knows this. But she yelled and got snippy and nasty with me because I don\u2019t stay home. Even though when I am home I\u2019m just in my room and away from the \u201cfamily\u201d. I come home around 10 because I respect their wishes that they don\u2019t want me spending the night with my boyfriend. It just seems like a control thing that she wants me in the house. I\u2019m 24 btw. And I\u2019m from an Asian family.

        "selftext": "For background info: I (17F) go to my local gym almost daily. There is a man who goes to my gym (maybe 48F) who always seems to want to converse with me. Last time, he stared at me smirking as I was trying to workout, so I gave him a rude look, hoping he\u2019d look away but instead he told me I looked angry and said I should \u201ctake my anger out on the punching bag\u201d. USUALLY; I go to the gym with a gym buddy, but today I was alone. Today while I was resting between sets, the man walked up to me from across the gym and spoke, but I kept looking down on my phone and I was listening to music. He walked away after I didn\u2019t respond and did a set of hip thrusts. After finishing another set; as I was resting, the man approached me AGAIN and I tried to ignore him. He did NOT walk away this time, so I paused my music and looked up at him. The man asked me if I was missing my friend this time, and if I came to the gym everyday, and why I went to the gym so often. He then proceeded to get on the LAT RAISE machine directly across from me\u2026. I\u2019m an anxious person and very hyper aware, and I took his questions as a way to figure out whether I was alone and vulnerable and when I\u2019d be at the gym. I cut my workout short and left. I was so upset about it, I was worried he\u2019d follow me or something (he did not). I called the gym shortly after and told the staff I didn\u2019t feel comfortable and did not want him to talk to me. She apologized for me feeling uncomfortable, told me she knew exactly who I was talking about, and let me know she had no issue relaying that to him. After relaying this story to my brother who ALSO goes to this gym; I\u2019ve been told that the man could be autistic or something of the sort, thus having a lack in social cues. I understand that, but I still feel like I should be able to workout without feeling anxious or unsafe. note: I did watch him talk to other people as he made his way around the gym; I wasn\u2019t aware that it wasn\u2019t just me, so he really might just be trying to socialize and could be missing social cues.

A week before Christmas she decided to stay in my room and sleep with me all night, it was the best feeling of my life. She was purring, making biscuits next to me and cuddling me the entire time. However there is one other thing. My step dad always used to sleep with peachy but since she\u2019s been sleeping with me he\u2019s acting all butt hurt about it. at first I thought it was a joke and shrugged it off thinking he was just surprised that one of the cats liked sleeping with me. Eventually it got to a point where my mom started telling me to kick her out of my room. I\u2019m living with very bad depression right now and love that I have a cat to hold at night when I feel sad.  I also want to point out that my step dad and my mom sleep with two other cats in that room. Known as Gary and kimchi, the other one we have mostly keeps to himself and another who does love and will actually come if I call her but she\u2019s got her own issues, she\u2019s very old and has little control of her bladder and is very stubborn about using the litter box meaning when I wake up in the next morning our room is reeking of cat piss and peachy is the only cat who\u2019s actually been affectionate toward me. I want to keep her in my room but my mom is telling me to kick her out.

        "selftext": "Basically what the tittle says but here is more context. I am a 20f college student, I have great friends in college and we hang out a lot. The thing is that next spring break we want to go in a trip four days to one of ours friends house who has a house in a beach area. We have been talking about this trip for more than a year but finally we are doing it. And so my mom some weeks ago told me that she would like to go on a trip during the spring break with me, I like travelling with my mom but tbh I have only travelled not time with friends we went to a village so I am excited of going with my college friends to the beach. As any of my friends and any other person of my age I enjoy being with my friends more, partying, playing games...whatever. I love my mom and I feel awful because she has chronic back pain and when we go on a trips I follow her rhythm which I do not have a problem with but at the end there's a lot of things that we do not see. And happens the same with an Erasmus exchange that I am doing next year, I had to convince her to that for 2 years because she always tells me: you are living so good and you leave me here alone with your grandma (I live with my mom 61 and my grandma 87) and when you grow up you are gonna  be independent and leave me alone here cause your grandma won't he here forever, doesn't make you sad? She then laugh a bit and said she says it as a joke but ofc it makes me sad, I feel awful when she tell me this kind of sentences but I want to live my life too, I wanna life things. And I am an adopted child, I was adopted when I was only 20 days alive and on one side I feel I should be with her since she has given a lot of things to me and take care of me, but also wanna be independent, I'm studying hard for that. And I wanna do that trip but not rn, so I would like to change dates, but knowing my mom I am sure she would get mad and at the end we won\u00b4t do it. So, would I be the asshole for choosing the trip with my friends rather than the trip with my mom?",

        "selftext": " I (20 F) live with my Step Mom (42F) and my Dad (43M) along with my three younger siblings. I have two brothers B(18M) and T(10m) and a little sister E (9F). We have a nice sized house. We all have our own rooms. I work at an after school program so it's from 1:30 to 6:00 not a lot of hours but It's still work. I'm going to start College in the summer, fingers crossed. Anyway my brother B also works at an after school program same hours as me. Neither of us drive so He bikes and I take an Electric scooter which I payed for myself. So I typically get home before him.  The only difference between us is that he has a SHIT ton more freedom than I do. Which is fine I don't mind he has a lot of friends and goes out a lot. After work or on the weekends. Or even sometimes on the weekdays. So when I'm home my siblings E and T are also home.  My parents D and P (my step mom) are extremely social people so they always have something going on. And E and T aren't always allowed to join them on their adventures for example when they go out to have adult hang outs or parties. The times my parents stay out really late. And I do mean late they usually come back between 12:00 to 2:00am. Which I don't mind. They're adults and they can enjoy their lives.  What annoys me though is that whenever my parents leave T and E in our care (I say our care because B is supposed to help too) but it usually ends up just being me taking care of them, making them dinner, keeping them entertained, making sure they get to bed on time. Thing like that. On top of that we recently just got a puppy her name is Stella and she's only 10 weeks old so she needs to constantly be watched. And in the mornings before I leave for work I watch Stella and my other dog Diva who's only a year old. No help from him whatsoever. He stays in his room until he leaves for work or wakes up at 11:00. We both have ADHD and have medication. So we have to take it in the morning.  Anyway lately it's been getting worse. P always leaves us a list of chores she wants done before we both go to work (which is fine because I genuinely need a visual list for me to be able to get things done) And I usually end up doing 90% of them since B doesn't wake up or just doesn't leave his room. Don't get me wrong it's not that he never helps he just rarely does so. But it's so frustrating when I'm watching the kids or the dogs and doing chores while he chills in his room playing videogames. It's not like he works anymore than I do. Or does anything about the house when he is home. Plus when he randomly decides to go out guess who's stuck doing extra chores that HE should be doing? Me. It's getting really annoying, Even my parents are getting frustrated with his lack of helping. But he doesn't seem to care. AITA for telling him to do stuff around the house?",

        "selftext": "Let's jump into this: I (29F) gave birth to my 3rd baby in November.  The women in my husband's family (his 2 sisters, our sil, and his mom) and I have a group chat whereas we send pictures of our kids, tell funny stories about our day, and, in this case, send updates about possible labor.  On this particular day in November, at 37 weeks plus 5 days gestation, I reached out to inform that this just might be the day my newest baby decides to make his grand entrance. I had been having strong contractions since 5:50 that morning.  Everyone, except sil (my husband's brother's wife) responded with excitement and praying hands emoji's.  Well, according to the nurses at the hospital, I wasn't dilated enough to be admitted, despite strong and frequent contractions.This was at noon. I updated the chat. Everyone seemed concerned and asked if I still thought if it might still be that day.  I assured it was most likely going to happen that day, judging from past experiences, but I would go home to labor in comfort. This is where i might be the a-hole.  My sil, who also gave birth to her 3rd baby a couple months prior (via c-section. I am not judging nor think of her as less than, just context is key) decided to text how glad she was that I wasn't in real labor and that it's better that I wait to have the baby another couple of weeks. She then sent a bunch of screen shots and links to articles about false labor and Braxton hicks. AS IF I HAD NEVER GIVEN BIRTH BEFORE OR EXPERIENCED PREGNANCY BEFORE. I replied, mid contraction:  Not to be bity, but this ain't my first rodeo, and I know how to Google things as well.  And yes, I have been checked, and they will check again before deciding IF I should go home or not. Well, I did go home, only to go back to the hospital a couple of hours later and had my baby at 10:15 that night.  Sil does not reply to me in texts, and has since unfriended me on Facebook. (Not that I really care about that.)  I just want to know it I was an a-hole for what I said... and, in hindsight, perhaps I shouldn't have been texting in the groupchat while in labor.  So, reddit. Was I an a-hole? Edit: I meant to elaborate on the c-section detail. Which definitely makes me come across as someone who looks down on her for it. Which I do not.  Her first baby was a preemie and she had an emergency c-section. Her youngest 2 were scheduled. The point I was trying to make was that our experiences with pregnancy and childbirth are completely different.  Which, I could have said without the c-section fact. My apologies.  Edit: a little more info about my sil and my relationship. She thinks she's the matriarch of the family, even if she won't admit it. We recently moved out of state (only 2 hours away, long drive, but not as long as they treat it), a few months before I gave birth, and she started cutting us out of family get together and even created a whole new group chat without my husband and me. She is always shocked at how intelligent my husband is because he went to community college instead of a university, like she did. I didn't go to college. I saw no point in going into debt, I didn't know what I would go to college for, so I decided to wait. So she often treats me like I am unintelligent.  I think the snappy text was probably long incoming. But it was poorly timed and shouldn't have been in a group chat.It was not the first time I had gone off on her in a group chat either. She singled me out a few months prior, questioning my ability to care for my kids by myself while my husband was away for a couple of days.  Yes, in the big family group chat.So I snapped back. My husband saw the message before me and said I'll let you handle her. As he held me back many times beforehand to keep peace. Like I said, it was possibly poorly timed but long incoming. ",

        "selftext": "I (M 33) am watching my boyfriend\u2019s dog while he\u2019s away for work for about a month. My roommate (M 34) is having a stressful week at work and works most days from our apartment. On Monday and Tuesday, I went to the gym to work out with my friend who\u2019s a personal trainer and training me for free on his time. So, I left at 4:30 and came back at 6:30 and my roommate said he cannot handle dog watching while I\u2019m away and he\u2019s working. This is the calmest and least needy dog I\u2019ve ever met and he\u2019s a 10 years old yorkipoo. He just sleeps and occasionally barks when he hears our neighbors coming and going. My roommate said that he can\u2019t mentally separate having a dog hanging out at home or if I had brought home a guest and then left him alone to entertain my friend. I just needed 2 hours away to workout. My roommate was at the office most of the day Monday and Tuesday and then came home and had more work to do. He came home just as I was leaving for the gym at 4:30 and I came home and was lectured more about how I didn\u2019t listen to him and left him alone to dog sit again. I don\u2019t see how this is dog sitting; he doesn\u2019t have to walk, feed, or even interact with the dog. So, am I the asshole for not understanding where he\u2019s coming from and still trying to go to the gym for my 2 hours?  EDIT for more info: I did inform my roommate that I would be taking care of the dog for a month and he said that was totally fine. I\u2019ve also spent multiple days away with the dog at my boyfriend\u2019s place to give my roommate more space when he\u2019s working from home. This week, he\u2019s working at the office most days til 4 and I leave for the gym at 4:30. I plan on spending the rest of the week at my boyfriend\u2019s place since I know this week is a lot for my roommate. But that\u2019s also a big inconvenience for me and adds an additional 25 to 40 minutes to any commute I have to make which is usually only 5 to 10 mins. I also have to go grocery shopping so I have food at my boyfriend\u2019s place and pack enough clothes for the week. Doing all that so he doesn\u2019t have to spend 2 hours alone with the dog just seems like a lot. ",

        "selftext": "So 5 years ago me, my brother, and 2 other good friends we\u2019ve known for 20+ years planned a big trip to ski in Europe.  A year ago we started talking about doing it again for my 40th birthday but skiing in Japan this time.  We also decided to open up the invite to a specific few others that we all knew well from college and who wished they were invited on the last trip.  Two more committed so now our group was 6 people.  A couple weeks ago one friend Payton (name changed for privacy purposes) asked my brother Johny who was planning the entire trip if he could invite his half brother.  Johny told him politely no because nobody else knew him and adding a 7th would mess with logistics (guides, dinner reservations and hotel reservations) and the vibe would be different having someone there nobody knows.  Payton wasn\u2019t happy and said \u201cbut I thought we were opening up the trip to others\u201d to which Johny reminded him that was only to specific people we\u2019ve all known since college.  Well a week later Johny told people nobody can back out at this point because our most expensive hotel reservation was becoming non-refundable to which everyone confirmed they were not backing out.  4 days after this and a month before the trip, Payton tells my brother Johny and myself his half brother is coming and he\u2019s not going to be rude and uninvite him and we are being jerks for saying he can\u2019t come.  He apologizes for misunderstanding that we only opened up the invite to certain people but refuses to un-invite his half brother.  We tell him if he\u2019s truly sorry, he\u2019ll tell his brother it was a miscommunication and he\u2019ll do another trip with him.  He refuses and says he and his brother are coming on the trip and following the exact same itinerary whether we like it or not.  All 5 other members of the group call him and tell him what he\u2019s doing is very socially awkward and selfish to bring this all up after flights and hotels were non-refundable.  He still refuses to change course.  So we changed our logistics now to expel him from the ski group with guides and we aren\u2019t letting him stay in the rooms we booked and we plan to not hang out with him on the trip but he and his half brother will be on all the same flights and likely staying at same hotels which will be awkward.  Who is in the wrong here and how should this situation be handled? ",

Macy is five now, and she only sees her father when he decides to visit her. He's missed birthdays, her first day of kindergarten x2, recitals...all things that he said he was attending, but ended up as no-show. Despite all of this, Macy still adores him and thinks the world of him. So we don't tell her when he's coming to an event now, to save her the disappointment. She just thinks it's a fun surprise when he does show up.  There is a father-daughter dance coming up at Macy's school, which she is begging to go to. I said I'd take her, and she was super excited. But she mentioned it during one of the visits, and now my brother is mad. He says that I shouldn't be taking over, it's a father-daughter dance and Macy is his kid - not mine.  AITA for deciding to take my niece to a father-daughter dance without asking her father? ",

        "selftext": "I (17F) am turning 18 in July. Because of this, I'm already starting to prepare what I'm going to take with me when I move out, even though that likely won't be a while because I also plan to move in with 2 of my close friends and we need to arrange where we'll be living first. Some things I definitely want to take with me when I move out are my gaming consoles. An Xbox 360, an Xbox One S, and a Playstation 4, all of which were given to me as birthday or Christmas presents. Because they were given to me specifically, I think it's only fair that I get to take them with me when I move out. However my mother doesn't seem to think so. My mother believes that I can only take one console with me, the ps4, and leave both Xbox consoles with them. Her justification for it is that she and my sister (5) won't have anything if I take all the consoles. She also said that it's a thing that when you get a new console the older one is passed down as a family console. I thought this was completely stupid, because they were given to me as gifts, and now she just expects me to leave 2 of them behind just so they can actually have gaming consoles. I'd like to add that I've spent my own gift money on both the ps4 AND xbox one to buy games and other things for certain games, but she's also bought quite a bit of stuff on the xbox too (DLCs for the Sims 4 mainly). That's another reason why she doesn't want me to take the xbox one, because she spent money on it herself. I feel like she's trying to just guilt trip me, but I need to know if I'm really in the wrong for wanting to take things that were given to me with me when I move out. WIBTA? Edit to add: I feel like I should have pointed this out originally, but my mother is acting like there would be absolutely no at home gaming consoles left in the house when that isn't the case at all. We have an old gamecube that has quite a few games too, all it needs is to get new cords to plug in to the tv and then the power button needs to be fixed because it's stuck pressed down Edit 2: since a lot of people are bringing up visiting my family when I move out and leaving one console there for them and switching the consoles out, that wouldn't be an option, if I leave a console it's gone for good. My parents haven't been the best people my whole life for more serious issues I didn't feel the need to go into before, but these things are making me decide to go no contact with my father and limited contact with my mother.",

These people sent my mom a check for my college around the beginning of the semester to pay for tuition. I recently learned that she used that check to buy stuff for my dorm and other things. I will say, she didn't use it on herself; it doesn't change the fact that she used it on something she wasn't supposed to. I learned this because I needed most of the semester to be paid for to enroll for the next semester. I told some of the people helping, they aren't the same as the government people; they are part of the college to let them know. I didn't know it would get either of us in trouble. These people almost didn't help me any more thanks to that; I was annoyed, mostly because I never knew till this year. Earlier yesterday, I was asking my mom for some money to pay for my phone so I can get a call for the job I'm trying to get, and she told me she can't because I got her in trouble and she now has -$1000, she didn't seem happy about it. I decided to talk to my sister about it; she took my mom's side, telling me I should have kept it to myself. Should I have? Am I wrong here?",

I have a friend, who i will call Lara (25F), and she unfortunately has a problem with punctuality. She has a tendency to be at least 20 minutes late, but there have been times where she has even been 40-50 minutes late. This is not due to traffic, but because she starts getting ready late and goes out of the house 5 minutes before our agreed time if not later. I have told her multiple times that i do not appreciate it. For example, I have sat alone in a restaurant for half an hour to make sure we did not lose the reservation. And this is just one of the situations which leave me frustrated. Other than that, she is a good friend and we have Lots of fun hangouts together. Well yesterday evening it was very cold and windy outside (1 Degree Celsius), and we had planned to meet in the city centre and go for food and drinks afterwards. I had texted her to remind her to leave her house on time. It takes me around 40 minutes to get there, so I cannot spontaneously just exit the house and be there, I have to plan my time. When I arrived, I was right on time (as opposed 10 minutes earlier, because I know it\u2019s useless with her anyway) and I started waiting. After around 30 minutes I lost my patience, texted her to forget it and just left. I was cold and in a bad mood, especially because she told me that she would be there \u201cright away\u201d. She apparently was there 15 minutes later and called me upset, that I don\u2019t understand how she is and I am being a bad friend. That I should not make plans if I am not okay with waiting, which I did not agree with. Still, I have never left like this before and I feel guilty for leaving her like this. Was I the asshole? Little update I have left in the comments: She called me a few hours ago, and we talked for a bit. She apologized for insulting me, ignoring my messages AND for being late this time. She sounded like she really regretted it, but I was a bit bitter about the fact that I had to take it this far for her to wake up. I did not talk about meeting up again, as I just want to let it sink in a bit more and not just two days. And I think afterwards I will use one of the suggestions that said to meet in a cafe and give her a range, such as \u201cI will be here from 15 to 15:30\u201d, and see how that works out. I truly don\u2019t want to lose her and I was sorry to hear her like this, but she hurt me first and she needs to understand that too",

        "selftext": "My (23M) friend/flatmate (34f) has a very sweet and loving cat that I believe she is not looking after very well.  For context she is a very busy university student currently studying a masters degree. Her cat has a history of running rampant in her room, has destroyed plants and various things, gone to the toilet on mine and a flatmates bed, and just done various other chaotic acts.  Personally, I believe he does these things because of her neglect and lack of care. Firstly she takes him on multiple 5+ hour car journeys a year whenever she goes home from uni. She keeps him in a cage that is just big enough to fit his bed, litter tray and food/water bowls whenever she is out (so he doesn't destroy things). He never goes outside even on walks with her. He is barely allowed outside of her room even when he is out of the cage because of his destructive nature.  He had an injury lately which meant he had to have a cone on his head and be in the cage for a while and even though the cone is off, the cage remains. She uses excuses like he is a chaotic cat and there is too much stuff in her room for him to destroy, but honestly most of it is trinkets and things she never uses that could easily be tidied away or thrown out if she wanted to give the cat more freedom. Or plants she keep buying even though she knows he will probably just knock more over.  He is such a lovely cat, very gentle when he is calm, he loves pets and attention and is really quite intelligent. I have been looking after him while she is away with instructions to feed him twice a day and put him back in the cage whenever I'm done. It just feels so wrong. I have played with him when I can and let him roam the house but he tried to jump out a barely open window in the 2nd floor, which just kind of shows how desperate he is to explore and have more freedom.  She does care for this cat but I am worried she is just using him as an emotional support without fully having the capacity to look after him well enough. He is a bit overweight and she spoils him with treats (like over Christmas he had 4 advent calenders) but he clearly isn't getting enough excercise. Her mental health is not good and she got him straight after her previous cat died so I want to approach this gently but firmly with her. I'm not sure what to say. Also when she takes him to her parents home, the cat is suddenly in a multiple cat household (although they all get along apparently) and allowed to roam for the most part. But she and the vet believe this is where his injury came from (fox bite) and I'm sure it must be very unstable for him going between the two: from extreme freedom to caged life. When she is home he can be out of his cage, but again just in one room and I often hear her telling him off because he just gets overstimulated and runs around.  What do I say to her that won't break our friendship but ensure this cat gets better treatment? ",

        "selftext": "My (19f) friends and I all decided to go on a ski trip for a 12 days over winter break. We found a place to stay and all in all it was around $600 per person for the rental and we decided it was just easiest to have one person (me) put all the money upfront and just everyone pay me back before the actual trip, which everyone did. In my friend group we have a girl let\u2019s call Sarah. Sarah comes from a comfortable family and was even one of the people who suggested the trip and was one of the leading forces to finding the Air Bnb. Literally in the weeks leading up to the trip we were all fine, sending outfit ideas, restaurants to books etc. the Tuesday before we left (Saturday) Sarah starts sending texts to the gc like \u201cguys Jacob\u2019s (boyfriend) family is going to xxxxx next week\u201d basically sending us a LOT of details about where his family is going for winter vacation that we didn\u2019t really need to know. Then on Thursday (again we leave on Saturday) she texts the gc saying how she couldn\u2019t go because she had a family emergency, said her grandma had gotten admitted to the hospital . We were obviously bummed but family comes first and I told her that I would send her the money back that she sent towards the rental. We go on the trip and everything is ok until one of my friends who has Sarah\u2019s location on Life360 (roommates) sees that she\u2019s in a beach town and we put 2 and 2 together. We spend that night pissed and we call her out the next day where she admits everything. She had been last minute invited on her boyfriend\u2019s vacation and decided that she wanted to go to that instead but didn\u2019t know how to tell us. We were all obviously hurt and upset that she would choose a boy over us but at the end of the day she\u2019s a 19 year old girl so I guess it\u2019s just immaturity. The part that I\u2019m wondering if I\u2019m the asshole with is that after finding out that she voluntarily pulled out of the trip, I had told her I wouldn\u2019t be refunding her the $600 she had sent me for the rental. She pulled out so last minute that we couldn\u2019t find anything cheaper and I said I was ok just wasting that money because again I thought she was having a family emergency. After finding out that she wouldn\u2019t be getting that back she went insane and started calling me a bad friend and everything. My parents think I should send it back to her but I don\u2019t see why I should, she pulled out because of her boyfriend and expected us to all just absorb the costs?? ",

He's also a part of this.  So my friend (25f) borrowed 12000rs (approx.135usd) from her two old workmates from Zimbabwe last year and they told her there will 100% be no interest and only has to return the 12000rs. She really needed it at the time and although she's still struggling right now,  she was finally able to find the 12000rs back. However in order to get it, she had to give her passport as collateral.  The issue now is that she's trying to give the workmates their money but they're refusing the 12000rs. They want 18000rs (approx 205usd). She told me and I suggested options but she's already done that. The only way she could give them the full 18000rs they're demanding is by getting the passport, opening a bank account, receiving her paycheck as they want her to specifically have this bank give the people their money and she has her passport. But they've refused. They want the full money right then and there and have told her they don't care what happens to her or her passport and if she doesn't want it, they don't care but she's not getting it back until she pays them. So she went to our landlord who is willing to help her request politely for the passport back and to give the original 12000rs and if they refuse, to involve police. But the landlord wants me to go with them. I don't want to go because I'm not sure of what could happen and I'm just a student. I dont want anything bad to happen to me. It could be dangerous. So I told my friend this and she was ok with it. However, I did tell her to be very careful herself when going with the landlord as we don't know how people actually are and they could both be harmed. That they should meet with them in a safe public space and should record the conversation. And that it could become a very dangerous situation because as she told me before, they're people who can be very aggressive and don't care for consequences. I told her all this and she laughed at me. Said I wasn't being serious and it's just me thinking childishly and that Africans are actually scared of Indians.  I told her it really doesn't matter who is afraid of who and anything could happen. She just shut me off and told me to stop talking about it. I apologized and she angrily just told me to stop talking about it again and that it doesn't concern me anymore and to leave. She says nothing could ever happen to her. I just wanted her to be safe and I'm not sure if that was the right moment to tell her that. Was I in the wrong or not to tell her that?  I",

And now my dad is getting a bunch of hate from all of my family about how I'm such an evil person for not giving my aunt money that I didn't know what she was going to use it for.. here's all that happened and why i cut contact and refuse to give her the money:  I had a house fire when I was 12, i lost my mother and brother in it,, the house that burnt down my parents didnt own that house, my aunt bought it, my parents paid rent plus all the bills, my aunt didnt get house insurance (WE THOUGHT SHE DID) so we got no money nor the Decision to keep the house up, During this time my dad was in surgery, so he was healing at the hospital  I went to go live with The aunt who had bought the house for us, That same aunt tried stealing me from my dad As in trying to get custody over me she lost, after my dad got out of the hospital we went and lived with a different aunt, we had my other other aunt start a gofund me, we raised alot of money but the aunt who started it stole most of the money from it, only giving my dad half, when we found out we moved from my other aunts house to an Apartment, we moved to a house we're I moved out, I'm in college I live in the Dormitory, So with All this being said, AITA? Edit: The reason why my dad hasn't cut ties is because he's worried it will backfire on him, and he wants our family to be able to ask him for help. the reason why my aunt came to me for money is because I was a rug (I let people walk all over me because i felt no self worth) when I was 12-18, and because I hadn't talked to her in two years she thought I'd still be easily manipulated and the same. Edit 2: My dad is telling me I either give her the money or he cuts contact with me? He's choosing his sister who stole from us rather than me, his only daughter. My older brothers are saying just cut him off and ignore him till he comes back to reality... I might have to give in on the money, I don't want to lose my dad... I don't have enough money, I'm thinking of working overtime at my job and selling some of my artwork... I'm not sure what to do.. I can't believe he's doing this because of family's family. I get that, but she's no family of mine, and I owe her nothing. Edit 3: I'm not giving in, I texted my dad telling him you need to come back to reality, your siding with a snake who stole from us after losing my mom and brother.

        "selftext": " So me and my sister, we get along pretty well. We spend every day together and my mum is also at home every day when she isn't working. My sister HATES sharing. She refuses to share when told or she will give me something if she feels like it and is in a good mood.  I, on the other hand, will share quite regularly and when told (I'll get to that, it's quite important) and she sort of apprectiates it. If i offer her a bite of my food she'll eat like half of it but I don't mind. I'll only tell her absolutely no if it's something special or something I really want.  Now my mum. My sister has a very demanding personality and my mum is more gentle. That leads to my sister being dominating of my mum so she gets what she wants a lot. My mum enables that, so when I tell her no to having, say, one of my chocolates, my mum will force me to give my sister what she wants.  Now, today. So I got a present from my sister, it was a Sanrio mystery bag with sparkly tickers. I like Sanrio so I loved it and I decorated my laptop with them, leaving about 8 or 9 stickers left. My sister wanted some but I said no she can just buy some, I don't see why she needs mine. She's been asking non stop for just one sticker but I said no. Tonight, she asked again for stickers so I said, rather frustrated, no Im not giving you a sticker, stop asking me constantly. I said it in a rude way because she has been asking me constantly for more than 2 months. My mum and sister were staring at me with disgust and my mum said are you even Christian anymore? Jesus says to share. She always brings religion into these things so I said yes mum I am, just because I'm not giving her my stuff doesn't mean I'm not Christian.  My sister ended up calling me names and saying I was immature so I said is it mature to not respect no for nearly 2 months?. My mum started getting angry and called me a f**khead turd selfish b***ch and told me that she wouldn't be taking me anywhere. I told her that was manipulative and she responded with I don't give a flying f**k. It went on for a bit longer and yes I was being rude because im sick of it, my sister gets what she wants all the time and she caused this huge drama over one sticker.  Then my sister came in again saying you're nearly 18, you caused all this over a sticker, you're being so rude for nothing. I got annoyed and said you're nearly 16, you won't respect no. I've been repeating over and over. I told her she's been harassing me and I'm sick of it. She keeps saying I only asked you once so I say no, you've asked multiple times over 2 months but then she responds with I meant tonight and it's really annoying that she asking me more than once when I already said no.  My dad is on my side and told them both it doesn't matter, it's her stickers so why should she have to give it to (my sister) but they both keep saying oh she was so rude but my dad sees why I'm so annoyed.  Anyway idk what to do or if I'm wrong,  AITA?",

        "selftext": "Using a throwaway because she uses this subreddit also. Sorry for any typos I wrote this in a rush. Yeah, this is kind of weird, but I needed to ask because I'm autistic and also aroace, so I'm not too great with social stuff, especially for Valentine\u2019s Day, so I was wondering if I was in the wrong here. Recently my (18m) best friend (18f) asked me for some help with making a gift for her boyfriend (again 18m). They\u2019ve been dating for a few months, and her boyfriend and I happen to have similar interests, and I like crafts, so she originally asked me to help her make some matching bracelets for them, which I was super excited to do. I even ordered some new materials to do so since all my bracelet-making stuff has gotten kind of old and brittle. Earlier this week, though, she told me that I wouldn\u2019t have to make them anymore, which was a little sad, but I could still use the materials to make gifts for the rest of our friend group (which I want to be a surprise). Anyways, this is all to say I know she\u2019s planning to give him something on Valentine\u2019s Day. likely handmade since she likes crafts as well. Recently she texted me that she didn\u2019t even want flowers for Valentine\u2019s Day anymore, and when I asked why, she explained that her boyfriend was making it sound like a hassle to get her them. I was pretty upset, but I just told her that it was a weird thing for him to say. I would like to add this is not a thing of flowers being expensive or anything he can very much afford it. He simply doesn\u2019t want to go out of the way to get them for her. Also, she literally had to ask him to make him get her those flowers. Not sure if it was a Valentine's gift in general, but definitely for the flowers. This is where I might be the asshole. I decided to go to the store and buy some construction paper, following a YouTube tutorial I saw to try and make her a paper bouquet. I originally thought it\u2019d be a nice gesture, especially if her boyfriend doesn\u2019t get her the flowers. I don\u2019t have many friends in real life, so I told one of my online friends about it since I didn\u2019t want to spoil the surprise. They ended up scolding me, though, and told me I was overstepping and that it\u2019d be like I was trying to one-up her boyfriend. I didn\u2019t think I was wrong at first, but now I'm conflicted. I don\u2019t want to one up him or anything I just want to make my friend happy. So yeah, would I be the asshole if I gave my best friend a paper bouquet for Valentine\u2019s Day? EDIT: Forgot to say it\u2019s normal for the two of us to give each other gifts on Valentine\u2019s Day. We\u2019ve been doing it ever since we were kids I\u2019m talking about the specific gift because I\u2019m going to be giving her something no matter what.",

I didn't know due to not being on my phone, around 9:15-9:35 I was called & texted by A(18 M). me & A were in a MC dino server where I had 1 dino. & while gone, my dino starved & died. Now around 11 I finishedwatching the movies & checked my phone, where I was met with texts & calls from A. I called, wondering what happened to my dino. I was then met w/ a bitch tone. After they had told me of my dinos death, INGAME, They hung up after silence. So after a bit I called back & I was met with nada. They denied the call after a few seconds. I went to discord asking to answer the phone. Now atp I was upset bc theyre rude for no reason! I wanted to confront them, after 2 years of taking their BS i was done. I was done being treated shit. They then put me in a GC w/, them & O (18 M). I joined the vc pissed and I admit, I raised my voice a bit. I was interrupted many times during the fight. They left from being upset & O followed. during this I was on Vr with T. S had Left before the 2nd movie ended. We talked and my vr then died So me & T went on a call in dms instead! After talking a bit I went to get my other friend V (20 F)s opinion on the situation. She said that i wasn't in the wrong. i wasn't sure of myself. Me & T stayed on call chatting on wht to do. I looked @ my call history, texts, & texted my online dad to get Info. During the fight A Said they had Called me within 3 hours. Now after checking Texts & call history it was more of a 20-30 min time period. I was rightfully upset & then texted another friend. He had been on the dino server a lot more then me and A. I asked him if in the Mod we were able to feed other peoples dinos. He said yes. I took the SS and T into a call with A & O. I talked to A saying how they were wrong & that if i seem like an AHole then im sorry. They again kept interrupting me & saying i was being an AHoleA then left the call. I,Upset, due to all of this being dumb spoke to O asking their thoughts. O said i was An AHole in the 1st vc w/ them & A. They Told  A's side & my past response to them not replying soon, & then getting upset for not texting back ASAP.  Which I said was wrong & made them upset. O left the call after some banter. Me & T stayed in the call talking & saying how i was rly not being an AHole & then talked about random things. later O & A joined back. This time A had me \u2018muted\u2019 & O was silent. I asked why they had joined back and O said they were worried about T. Both me & T were confused because they had no reason to be worried? We talked some more, i got mad. I talked to O & T was quiet. I said how i was done w/ A\u2019s BS & how they do this each time a fight similar would take place. We talked & eventually T Msg me in dms that O was ab to have a panic attack. both T & O left, since they shouldn't be involved and it should be between me & A.i tried talking to A & They left.",

        "selftext": "Hey Reddit, I\u2019m a 36-year-old dealing with some unresolved family and financial issues from my past, and I need your perspective. The Backstory:I worked full time at my parents\u2019 Quiznos for about five years. Based on the minimum wage rates during those years (assuming 40 hours per week), I should have earned roughly $72K in gross wages. After subtracting partial payments they made\u2014specifically, $600 per month for 4 months (totaling $2,400) while I was in college, plus an extra $400 they gave to cover divorce lawyer fees\u2014I calculated a net claim of around $69,400. Family Dynamics and My Situation:\t\u2022\tI lived with my parents until June 2007. Later, I returned and stayed with them for about half a year before eventually getting kicked out. After that, I ended up moving from couch to couch.\t\u2022\tMy immigration status was a huge issue because my parents never set it up correctly. I ended up with no proper status, and my mom even told me I should have saved money since I was essentially on my own.\t\u2022\tThroughout all of this, my dad never actually paid me what I was owed for the work I did\u2014even though I was working full time and handling responsibilities well beyond just making sandwiches. My Request:Now, after all these years, I\u2019m asking my parents for the back pay I\u2019m owed. I know this might stir up family drama, especially since they own the business, and I\u2019m aware that some might see it as ungrateful. But the fact remains: I worked for them, I wasn\u2019t paid what I was owed, and I\u2019ve been left to deal with the financial fallout for decades. So, AITA for asking my parents for the back pay from my time working at Quiznos? I\u2019d appreciate any thoughts or advice on whether my request is fair given the circumstances. Thanks in advance. \u2014 Conarly  UPDATE So I graduated high school in June of 2006 and started in march of 2006.. I was 17 at the time a minor until November 2006 where I turned 18 .. from November till may I worked almost 72hr due to him getting in an accident.. I then got told to go live in England because me and my dad was having trouble getting along.. I went to England paid by my parents yes.. worked in England moved to Germany and came back a year and a half later.. I was 20 Turning 21 I live with my parents 6 months after that when I was kicked out again..due to standing up for my self asking for some sort of pay or recognition.. without a visa I had no choice but to work for my dad who said he\u2019ll pay me $4 an hour to keep it under the radar of the irs since I was illegally here in the USA.. btw he didn\u2019t pay me the $4 dollars an hour he would make calculations on how I\u2019d be left with a 4 dollar paycheck.. I was living on a friends couch working for my dad and having another job at another Quiznos. Friend kicked me out after 3 weeks after he blamed his pot on me.. I went to another friends house when I stayed on they couch paid rent while working both jobs and barley having anything left over.. I worked for my dad til the age of 23 where I would finally have enough of his abuse and quit. By the way since this time I\u2019ve built myself a pretty good life.. I have worked hard on shredded the verbal and physical abuse that my dad gave me my whole life.. I got married got papers and now have legal immigration status here in the us due to my hard work.. another thing is I am requesting now after all this time is because one.. I don\u2019t like feeling taken advantage without ever being able to get right about the situation.. so I think if I move forward at least pay me for wages when I didn\u2019t live with you and didn\u2019t get to save a thing before you kicked me out without a leg to stand on.. another reason why I\u2019m asking my old employer to pay me is because he couldn\u2019t at the time and that\u2019s the reason he kept giving.. he now came into a life changing amount of money and I\u2019m asking for my wages that\u2019s it\u2019s.. not trying to sue for more than what I didn\u2019t get paid",

        "selftext": "AITA? My (27m) husband and I (26f) have been living together for about 3 years. We have always had a basket in the bathroom for dirty laundry. The entire time we\u2019ve been living together I\u2019m the one who has always done laundry. When the basket gets full I take it to the laundry room and wash everything that\u2019s in it. For the past several months my husband has started leaving his dirty clothes mostly in a pile in the floor in the bedroom instead of putting them in the basket. We\u2019ve had conversations about this several times and he says he\u2019ll make sure to start putting his clothes in the basket, but nothing has really changed. This morning he made a comment about how he has to go to work in dirty clothes. Including dirty socks and underwear. I didn\u2019t say anything because I\u2019ve washed the clothes in the basket and was caught up on laundry. Then he asks me if I could wash his clothes for him so he doesn\u2019t have to go to work in dirty clothes. I told him that I\u2019ll wash his clothes when he puts them in the basket. He got mad and said I was petty for not washing his laundry and that he doesn\u2019t understand why I can\u2019t take 30 more seconds to pick up all his clothes off the floor and wash them. I told him that if it was so easy then why couldn\u2019t he take 30 seconds to pick them up and do it and that I wasn\u2019t his mom and I\u2019m not picking up his dirty clothes off the floor when there\u2019s a basket. According to him I\u2019m a petty asshole and don\u2019t do anything for him because I refuse to pick up his clothes from the floor to wash them. Am I the asshole for not picking up his clothes?",

        "selftext": "I\u2019m a minor living in Korea (an Asian country) with my parents, and I\u2019ve been struggling with my mental health for years. I\u2019m extremely antisocial, easily overstimulated, and I don't have the mental capacity to do pretty much anything that requires time, and it\u2019s only been getting worse. I know I need help. But every time I bring this up to my parents, they tell me I\u2019m exaggerating or just looking for an easy way out. They think I\u2019m lazy, that I just don\u2019t want to study, and they literally told me to my face that I don\u2019t take my future seriously, even though I\u2019ve been telling them about wanting to major in neurology. They've always told me to Study more when you can\u2019t, take a 10-minute break, and you\u2019re just making excuses because you didn\u2019t even try. They told this to me when I was crying and asking them if they could help me with my problems. And honestly, even though I didn't get any support from them and was upset when they told me this, I'm also pretty much convinced that I'm doing things wrong too. Six months ago, I finally convinced them to take me to a psychiatrist to get tested for ADHD. The doctor said I wasn't really ADHD since I was at the borderline, but she noticed strong signs of depression and wanted me to come back for more appointments. My parents didn\u2019t want to spend the money, and honestly, I backed out too because I felt guilty about the cost. The only thing I got was medication, which obviously didn\u2019t help because we never followed up. Since then, things have gotten so much worse, but my parents think that whole experience was a failure and a waste of money. So now, I feel like I can\u2019t ask for help again, even though I feel like I need it. Even though I'm not trying my best to keep things up at the moment, I don't feel like pushing myself further isn't working well, yet giving up makes me feel guilty. I feel like I\u2019d be the asshole for pushing this because:1. We don\u2019t have a lot of income, and I can't even let this stupid boarding school go because it's my 'final year of highschool' and they won't even let me consider it.2. I failed myself the first time3. I know I take a long time to open up. I don't even open up to my parents and they don't even know what my hobbies are (which isn't something weird, it's actually crafting)4. Like what my parents told me, I'm probably not trying my best But at the same time, I don't think I can keep going like this. So, WIBTA if I tried to convince them again?",

        "selftext": "I (M19) and my gf (f19) live 70 miles apart. She attends college in a neighboring city. She doesn't have a car, so I drive often. I picked her up and dropped her off this weekend. Because of the distance, my tiredness, and honestly, the intimidation of it, I had let the car get bad-messy. She took charge and cleaned it with me, and set a rule where I was not to eat in my car. She forgot her wallet and keys at home, so I drove them to her yesterday (Monday) despite her mom's opinion and some tiredness.  Today, I had a dentist's appointment in the morning and dinner with my friend. I decided to run some errands along the way and hit the gym. I had lent her my headphones when hers broke, so I stopped by and grabbed a cheap temporary/backup pair. So, there were a few receipts and the empty box, plus 5 bags in the backseat. I had forgotten to bring a trash bag for the car and planned clear it at home. While I was eating KBBQ with my friend, she messaged me she needed a hug stat and had half-jokingly mentioned she wanted food from her favorite restaurant. She has panic attacks sometimes, so I always want to make sure she feels supported. I wrapped up the evening within 15 mins. I overate badly, but I walked to my car with my friend, said goodbye, and drove to the restaurant (25 mins). I picked up the order, and drove another hour+ to her university. Parked, and brought the food up to her.  I wasn't planning to drive tonight, so I was exhausted and passed out on the couch next to her while she did some work. We drove to a park we frequent because she wanted to. She wanted to lay down. I asked her if she wanted to return to the dorm and she declined, so we napped.  She woke up and wanted to move to the backseat. She told me to clear the backseat, so I did. Then she told me to raise my seat up and switch to hers. I told her I was gonna put the passenger seat down. She was upset I was talking back to her and wanted to return to the dorm.  While driving back, she told me how my car was already so messy again despite how important it was to her. She mentioned the receipts, the bags I had moved, and the nail file up front (I have a bad nail biting habit). I told her I had no idea I was going to come tonight and was planning to clean the car when I got home. She told me my plans are meaningless because I didn't plan well for her birthday (2 months ago). This is something I have apologized for repeatedly, and have tried to make up to her. I tried to explain that the car would have been clean before we had planned to meet, but I was rushing since she told me she needed me stat. I tried explaining I understood her feelings, and tried validating them while staying firm. Argument continued until she was making preparations to leave. I asked her if she wanted me to walk her back. She declined. I told her I loved her, she said something I didn't hear, and she closed the door hard. AITA?",

The issue is Zach and Joe had a massive argument two weeks ago, to the point where Joe moved out of their house and is living with me. I asked them what happened and they both told me the same thing. Zach wants Joe to go to a medical school and become a doctor like him but Joe applied to a law school instead and gained admission. I have encouraged them to talk calmly. Hank, Zach\u2019s sister and I told Joe that if push comes to shove we will help pay for law school. We have enough money between the three of us to pay the tuitions, the costs of textbooks and the food, should his dad refuse to support him. But he should also give thought to talking to his dad. Their last conversation was basically a shouting match. We also told Zach that pressuring Joe to pursue a career he isn\u2019t interested in will only damage their relationship but he insisted on it, saying three generations of his family have been doctors and he doesn\u2019t want his son to be a \u2018bloodsucker.\u2019 Hank is worried that one of them might skip his wedding to avoid the other and asked me to help them reconcile since I\u2019ve known Zach longer. I told him I\u2019ll see what I can do but I can\u2019t make any promises; I\u2019ve never seen Zach this upset.

He laughed too. I laughed especially hard because I was high. In the moment I realized I might have laughed too much and might make him feel bad so I said that I wasn\u2019t laughing at him but with him, and tried to help him do the dance move and encourage him. This morning he tells me he went to bed feeling bad about himself and woke up feeling bad because I was laughing at him. I said that I was really sorry for that and that I was laughing with him, we were laughing together. I start to state my experience of the situation. He goes on saying that the way I laughed I seemed to enjoy it way too much, and that he can tell when he\u2019s being made fun of and apparently the only reason he laughed was because he felt awkward. He starts to get angry and I admit that I was technically laughing at him a little because it did looked funny and silly but that it was confusing because he had laughed as well.  He then starts to rant about how I let my ego get in the way of being loving and nurturing, that\u2019s why I couldn\u2019t control myself laughing at him to begin with and how I\u2019m a liar who does not take accountability and makes the situation about me when he was trying to share his feelings with me. Honestly I was high and it was just really fucking funny, but I wasn\u2019t making fun of him by laughing it was just my honest reaction in the moment. I was technically not honest in the beginning about laughing at him because I was high when it happened and it was objectively funny in general so I was confused if you could really classify me laughing intentionally at him. I do feel bad he felt the way he did because how I reacted and now it turned into a huge fight. He\u2019s calling me names and is stating I am making him do that because I\u2019m frustrating him and a liar who lets my ego control my reactions and behaviors. ",

We are both quite different flavors of autism and have very differing social skills. It's been smooth sailing so far, definitely my best flatting experience yet. Only hitch is that I can count on both hands the amount of times I've witnessed him showering with the bathroom door wiiiiide open. Now, I'm chronically online, an advocate for sexual liberation and generally an open minded person. But I do feel like I have to draw the line here. I generally struggle with being around men due to various bad experiences and do NOT want to see my flatmate in his birthday suit, especially since the bathroom is right next to our living room and is very hard to miss. I've tried to put this down to him not understanding basic social norms but he has a full time job in retail and seems very intelligent. I want to bring this up as I'm very uncomfortable but don't know if I'm being a shit flatmate or being overly paranoid. Help",

We live in Germany where I work in an English-speaking environment, so to get extra practice in, I told him that after x date, we'd switch to German, which he is fluent in (grew up here). We've managed two days so far, where even if he accidentally says something in English I answer in German, but last night he told me he needed a break from me speaking German. I refused, and said it's only for 10 weeks until my exam, then I'll go back to English. He says I don't sound like his wife when I speak German. I asked if it was because my mistakes were jarring or my vocab was causing issues. He said it just 'didn't feel like he was speaking to his wife'. I think it's vital that I stick to my plan, to get my speaking practice in. He seemed a bit sad after I said no.WIBTAH if I carry on auf Deutsch?  UPDATE: Thanks to most of you for very well-thought out and reasonable comments. I tried to read as many as possible and appreciate the different viewpoints. My husband came home this evening, we ate dinner, and I apologised (in English) for not being very understanding. I showed him the post... some of the comments made us laugh so much. We discussed and found a healthy compromise that works for both of us to help me prep but not exhaust him after a long day! I've also taken on your suggestions of other places I can try and hone my German conversation skills and will try some of them out. ",

I popped out of my room after that 30 minutes just to request that the cleaning could be held off until normal waking hours.

I have some minor sensory issues when it comes to audible noises that I can\u2019t control or confidently identify and my roommate knows this.

I would guess my roommate thought I was already sleeping It\u2019s only been an issue one other time in past 3 years of being roommates and it was when they were talking on the phone late at night and that seemed to be agreed as a reasonable expectation after discussing the following day.

        "selftext": "So, the thing is, my(22f) family has had huge financial crisis throughout our lives because of bad financial decisions taken by my father. Now, my sister(26) had to take up all the responsibilities right after school, she started teaching at a local school and since then She has been teaching and managing all our household expenses. Other than that, we also took up tutoring, and since then I've also been a part time tutor (we run an academy at our place). Now, she has recently started her ... business like in the last week only, we came up with the recipe, name, logo, planning, packaging everything. I have a younger brother too (18) and he helps in almost all things we do, like we used to work as home tutors and he would pick and drop us with zero complaints whatsoever, and his role is much more than just that. It is just that he is in his first year of grad and hasn't started working yet. Now the problem is, she has been a little weird since long, like maybe months. Like, she's always acting like I'm doing everything and all that. While we totally understand that it is a huge deal that she had quit her passion and do things that she didn't want to do and has been managing everything since forever and there's like zero appreciation from my dad for her, he still picks fights with her all the time. But we've always stood for her. No matter what. We've always appreciated her. We've always shown our gratitude towards her for the smallest of things. Because we genuinely are. Having said that, it sometimes feels unfair. Because my life wasn't as hard as hers, but even I have been tutoring since I was in Grade 9 and haven't stopped ever since. She  never seems to acknowledge any of that not does she consider it important to ever appreciate us for what we do. My brother was 16 when he had to take up responsibilities that he shouldn't have taken. But she does not care to appreciate him. Furthermore, she goes on to take us for granted and even belittle him sometimes. Now post this startup, she is like my business, my efforts, my company, my brand all the time while my brother is also working very hard for the brand. But she's like you need to get this done and like she's entitled for it but also goes on to say that I'm the only one working hard for it. I feel like telling her that she's not only being arrogant but also straight up discrediting him for his work. Please tell what to do. Sorry for the long post",

He is my baby and I love him and want the best for him, and I promised him (after having several homes) he would never have to deal with that again. Well about six months ago I was kicked out of my house by abusive parents who told me I had to choose between being my own person and getting to live there. Thankfully a friend's family took me in and things have been so much better since, but I had to leave my car with my sister at home because there's no room for him here and he's very shy. I'll probably never get him back since my sister loves him so much and my parents decided to help pay for him since I left, so he's happier and better taken care of than I could ever offer him. I just feel so horrible missing his sweet fuzzy face that used to wake me up in the mornings and the first bit of real family I had to call my own. There's nothing to be done about it I guess, unless I want to subject myself to abuse again (I know it's not worth it) but I don't know how to deal with leaving him, or the amount I miss him even though he is less than ten minutes away by care. So what do I do? Or am I the asshole for leaving him forever????",

        "selftext": "30M here with 27F GF- 3 months dating.  I was talking about my life to my partner about my career and how it got to be where it was because she didn\u2019t understand how I can have debts on a high salary. (Ex director, now a property development manager/managing quantity surveyor) I explained that the debts where from my previous LTD company (a construction company doing around 500k per annum with 6 employees), I explained that I closed the company because I could manage it on my own after my main foreman left to go to Australia. She said \u201cyou just need to manage your time better and employ people who manage themselves\u201d. I hadn\u2019t explained all the details around everything but I felt like she was making a suggestion about my competence.  I explained there wasn\u2019t enough time in the day to get everything done and she said you don\u2019t need to be on site all day and then a quote only takes an hour and that obviously it was something I was doing wrong because her dad has a construction company that she helped \u201crun\u201d for 6 months. I laughed and said a quote doesn\u2019t take an hour. She responds \u201cyeah you just need to work smarter\u201d.  Is it wrong to find this incredibly condescending? Her profession is a police officer and I said it\u2019s not like she is a manager or senior management which she argued against and said being a police officer is a manager. She then said that I had a failed business. I explained you\u2019re suggesting I\u2019m a failure and that I am bad with my timekeeping, bad at delegation and hiring, and generally a failure. She argued she isn\u2019t implying I\u2019m a failure but says that the business is a failure as a fact.  I said the business could have continue to run but I decided I didn\u2019t want to pursue it anymore how does that make it a failure? It closed, it didn\u2019t liquidate. She said \u201cif an actor stops acting he\u2019s a failed actor\u201d I said \u201cno if he was successful and then voluntarily quit, he is still successful\u201d.  I didn\u2019t fail at business, it wasn\u2019t making the money that I wanted it to make for the time and risk investment required. She said why does it matter it\u2019s nothing to do with your life it\u2019s in the past and it did fail and you could have improved your time management etc. I stated \u201cyou can use a blanket statement like work smarter and apply that to even the most successful business\u201d. She said \u201cit was advice you don\u2019t need to have a hurt ego\u201d, I said \u201cI was talking retrospectively and I didn\u2019t need advise and I would never say this to anyone about their business, if someone has invested years of their life into a business for you to call it a failure is a slap in the face and just unnecessary and that you should be supportive and should have just said something like sometimes these things don\u2019t work out.  Do I just have a fragile ego? Or am I right in thinking the use of these negative descriptive words shouldn\u2019t be used in a relationship? I\u2019m unsure if I\u2019ve overreacted because I\u2019ve told her that I don\u2019t think she respects me or my opinion.",

        "selftext": " So a year my brother in law (m47)was kicked out of his house by his now ex wife and he tried to harm himself severely. He realised his mistake called 999 and got the help he needed which included being sectioned. Now we where never really part of his life before this but being my husbands brother we offered a roof over his head once he was released on condition he got back on his feet to a position where he could solely support himself so he could move out. His mental health was severe so I supported him throughout that then he started getting better on the right medication and got a job but after a month he was sacked so he got another job but was sacked from that because he had a lot of sick days and since then (september) he has made no attempt to better himself he stayed in his room in bed all day then started drinking again every night but kept it at a limit he wasnt showering or taking care of his basic hygiene needs and it started to get to a point he was lying to us for a reason to drink like he was meeting friends or lady's which turned out he was just going the pub and getting sloshed on his own. Then 2 weeks ago he offered to pick me up from work but he went the pub at 1pm I finished in the evening so I messaged and said not to bother picking me up i'll get the bus. He kicked off and went awol we reported him missing because of his recent mental health he could have done anything to himself. But then after being missing from 6pm he appeared the next morning at 8am he said he slept rough. I believe he did this because I no longer wanted a lift and it was Punishment to me but I didn't want to get in a car with him driving if he had been drinking. Which I explained but he just though I was an ass hole. He then didn't drink for the rest of the week until Saturday. He was drinking in the evening me and my husband and child went to bed and left him I got a notification on my ring door bell he snuck out the house to buy more beer at 2.40am then again at 8am he went out to but more so at this point we was all awake and he was still up in The kitchen drinking my son had seen him in this drunken state and I was furious he allowed that to happen as I have shielded my son from actions this whole past year until then. So I told my brother in law that it's inappropriate to be in that state at 9.30 in the morning in front of his nephew and that I'd had enough and told him he needed to go bed and sleep it off he refused so I told him to GTFO he huffed like child and took himself to bed. Once he sobered up I told him that he has been here a year and the condition of staying here was that he was to get back on his feet and that he is now in a no better situation now than he was a year ago and that I have spent a year trying to help him get a job save money so he could move out on his own but as that's not happened and he is falling back into oblivion that a change a scenery will be best as we can no longer house him or support his life choices because it's affecting my marriage.",

A few months passed and we didn\u2019t really talk about future living arrangements again. Our current lease stated that we must give the landlord at least 60 days notice about whether we planned to renew the lease or move out, which we did. In the days leading up to that, we then discussed whether or not we wanted to stay in the unit, and we both agreed that we didn\u2019t want to stay in the unit. I explicitly asked him whether he wanted to stay in the unit, to which he said no, and since I told him I didn\u2019t plan to stay either we submitted to the landlord that we planned to not renew the lease. Another 3 weeks went by and we didn\u2019t talk about living arrangements until tonight. It was only when my soon-to-be future roommate (let\u2019s call him Andrew) joked over a dinner both Chris and I were invited to about our new apartment did he ask me what Andrew meant. I talked to him tonight, 41 days before the lease end date, about what my plans were and he is furious that we didn\u2019t have this conversation before the vacate notice deadline. He told me he is upset since I took away his choice to stay in the apartment, since it has already been leased to a new tenant so now he has to move and his new apartment may be more expensive than the current one (there are no available units in our complex that would work with our weird lease end date).",

I have told him before that I don\u2019t want to cut his hair, I have done it before and it\u2019s never something he ends up liking. Since the last time I cut it I told him, I am not going to cut your hair to avoid any issues. It\u2019s been months since his last hair cut, I have told him before to go look for someone professional to cut his hair, he refuses to look and drive far to get a hair cut. All the other times I have had to find a place for him to get his hair cut and sometimes the people that cut his hair he doesn\u2019t want to go back to either because of bad service or he ended up getting cut (ex. The back of his neck nipped) and I understand some reasons but I have told him to look for someone he would like to go see if he should check it out. Well last time I cut it, it was to long it wasn\u2019t what he wanted, this time it was to short. I am not a professional, this isn\u2019t a hobby I want to do this isn\u2019t something. I don\u2019t know how to cut hair and I really didn\u2019t want to do it the reason I did it this time was because we are low on money and can\u2019t pay anyone to cut his hair we barely have enough for food atm, I have also told him that he should cut his hair so I don\u2019t have but he hasn\u2019t tried. So I want to know AITAP.S. I didn\u2019t mean to cut his hair to short he claims I did it on purpose. When I told him I was trying to get it even.Edit; I take back that he hasn\u2019t cut his hair, he did it once and messed up bad, he was frustrated that I was to slow (first time cutting his hair) and he got the clippers and started to cut his own hair, safety guard fell off in the process and from then on hasn\u2019t tried to cut his hair because he had to go bald that time and still got upset with me for being to slow.",

It hasn't been verified but this guy is clearly autistic, but so was the roommate he replaced but we never had any issues with him.Anyways I DEEP cleaned the main areas before he moved in, and within the week after it was trashed. Milk was constantly being left out, he was taking dirty dishes OUT of the sink and spreading them across the counter spaces. On top of that he REFUSED to talk to or even look at us.Me and my other roommate got tired of this and we warned him if he keeps leaving all his stuff out, we were just going to start putting his stuff in his room for him to deal with. For the most part things got better, but he was still leaving stuff out a LOT. It was just usually taken care of by the end of the day.But one day, I noticed an OPEN jar of mayo, an OPEN pack of cheese, and an OPEN pack of ham. We don't share stuff like that so I just shrugged it off because I was in a rush to go to my girlfriend's place. I actually messaged him about it, and I said he needed to put it up, and if he didn't he was going to get sick. Well going into the third day, it was still there. He wasn't, and his door was wide open, so I closed the items, put it on his desk and walked out.THREE days later, he comes to me and says did you go into my room and put this stuff here? My room is a barrier that I want to be respected this is the first time if heard him say this and I did feel bad for doing it, but to my knowledge we were all on the same page.One random story I have of him that's kinda the same topic... he half cooked a chicken, turned off the pan, and went to class... he just... left the chicken... half cooked idk I thought that one was gross",

I have epilepsy and no medication, i panic and don't think much of the missed bus stop, sometimes it happens, i figure it's no big deal. i figure i'd get another bus back. all i can think of is how much time i have left to get my medication. the bus driver pulled me aside at the next stop, yells at me, and says that i missed the bus stop on purpose, i said i'd pay the difference, but he says he can't do that. i don't know what to say. i said I'm sorry but you were going so fast and i saw my pharmacy was closed, i panicked and was looking for open pharmacies on google.  i figure i'd get another bus into town to get an emergency prescription, lo and behold, same bus driver. he says to me, and i quote, you have some nerve getting onto my bus again. i looked at him and said i said i would pay the difference. he goes you know you can't. i said i'll pay it right now, add it on to my ticket i'm paying for. he sighs, shakes his head, and then calls me a liar and a cheater. it is a 40p difference in ticket by the way. i told him he was being unnecessarily hostile and rude and i left before it turned into a yelling match because he just seemed in the mood to pick fights, i went upstairs.  he proceeds to rant about me to another man who asked what happened so loudly that the entire bus can hear, he calls me a liar and a cheater again. tells the man i swindled him on purpose because i missed my bus stop, and cost the bus company 40p.  am i the asshole? i am genuinely unsure because his reaction was so severe it made me feel like i'd done something wrong.

        "selftext": "I (21F) recently connected with a dude (20M) online. We hit it off instantly and we exchanged snaps. He will text me good morning and text all day. He sends me pics of himself, his pets and siblings, and pics from his day. The only problem was that he would always be secretive and probably paranoid, since it was online. But him being secretive only made me paranoid, since I don\u2019t really talk to people that I meet online.  Basically, Whenever I would ask his name he would dodge the question and then about a week later he finally told me his name. He says he doesn\u2019t have any other social media, which I didn\u2019t mind (for the longest time I only had snap, so there was no judgement), His snap score was 900 (be for real\u2026 your a 20 year old attractive man, yk that snap score is higher than that) , he would often dodge calls, and basically while he would let me know about his days and send pics\u2026 I didn\u2019t know ANYTHING about this dude. At this point, I was super paranoid that I\u2019m being catfished or something  After 2 months of talking, and him constantly avoiding my questions but asking me questions about my personal life, I got kinda mad. So basically, I had asked him a question about his job, because I was curious , and he changes the subject. I asked again and he changed the subject again. So I asked \u201cwhy don\u2019t you wanna tell me??\u201d and he says \u201cwhat do u mean?\u201d so i tell him how i felt and basically to summarize it: \u201cWhy do you always avoid my questions or act weird about it? I ask you a question, you will change the subject but when I don\u2019t wanna answer a question, you will beg for me to answer. It is hypocritical and makes me feel a little bit weird and uneasy. I don\u2019t wanna be rude but we have been friends for 2 months and you still won\u2019t tell me anything.\u201d (copy n pasted from the chat btw) I thought the short paragraph was really mature but he didn\u2019t really like it. He told me that basically, he\u2019s paranoid online and that i\u2019m a b***h for saying that and not respecting his boundaries, even though no boundaries were ever set.  I can kinda see where I was in the wrong because maybe I didn\u2019t give him enough time to get comfortable and calling him a hypocrite might have been harsh. He blocked me and I guess I really wanna know if I was wrong for that. ",

Originally my bf said he did not care whether we did anything or not so I took it upon myself to plan a date I had suggested dinner a spa and possibly a hotel. However some of the plans changed and we decided to no longer go out of town to the dinner and opted to stay in our hometown for date night. Because of this I didn\u2019t see the need for the hotel anymore as I didn\u2019t find it reasonable to spend 200 dollars plus on a hotel where I already live and can sleep in for free. I didn\u2019t put money aside for the hotel anymore and instead decided I would cover the spa and my bf would just cover dinner so it\u2019s even( we agreed prior we were going to split the date).  When I told my bf about this he flipped out on me completely he was so angry at me for changing the plans on him. He\u2019s treating me like I\u2019m a terrible person because I didn\u2019t want to put the money aside for something I felt wasn\u2019t worth it in my opinion especially when I needed that money to pay an important bill. Instead of being understanding like I thought he would be he decided to say he no longer wants to do any kind of date at all whether I paid or not and that suddenly he was too broke to take me out ever again. I even offered to do a rain check on the hotel thing and it still wasn\u2019t good enough for him and he insists on not doing anything at all for our anniversary.AITAH for this? ",

They are 11 and 10.  They have been legally separated for the last 2 years and live in differnt states. She has continued to be in our kids lives and we all have agreed to keep the sibling bond strong amoung all 4 kids.  Last year she started taking the kids on seperate trips but 2 at a time to celebrate thier birthdays. One of her boys and my daughter went to Las Vegas (out of state for all of us) with her for their birthdays. And she took my son and her other son on a white water rafting trip for thier birthdays. Again out of state for her and her son.  A couple of days ago out of the blue my daughter was on FaceTime with step mom and my daughter asked to go on a overseas trip with just her step mom for 4 days over spring break. I asked if we could make a girls trip, so I could also go, and my daughter said no. I suggested something in county just the 2 of them and step mom is refusing that idea. My ex asked if he could go and my daughter said no. She just wants to spend time with step mom alone.  She claims to be a last minute planner and does not currently have a booked or planned out itinerary. And when I told step mom I wasn\u2019t comfortable with my daughter going alone with her she lost her mind. She is claiming I am robbing her of this amazing expirence out of jealously. I feel as if she is buying her affection and overstepping every parenting boundary there is under the sun. And completely disregarding my parenting decisions and disrespecting me as mom.  Ex supports daughter traveling with her alone and has basically washed his hands of the argument. She is ready to bring this to a court to force my hand. I hate this. I am not ok with my 13 year old dictating travel plans with out my input or censent.  Everything in me says this is not a good idea. I don\u2019t trust step mom, and I don\u2019t trust air travel right now  and with the state of the world I don\u2019t think traveling with out bio parent is a good idea.  So AITA?  ",

And one day he just got the train to our house us when me and my brothers practically don\u2019t even know him (a literal stranger). And he hasn\u2019t gone home because he\u2019s relying on my mum to take him because his house is 4 hours away and he doesn\u2019t want to get a train and always finds excuses why he can\u2019t go home. He\u2019s made it pretty clear he basically wants to live here. He doesn\u2019t bring anything to the table, I work doing cleaning and my mum works as a teacher. He literally does nothing, he has no job and sleeps till 3pm every single day he never goes shopping and he never leaves my mums side. I feel like he doesn\u2019t let my mum be alone with me for 2 minutes and I haven\u2019t had a conversation with her in 4 months because whenever I\u2019m about to speak to her he always asks her to go out (and my mum has to pay). He always says things about me to her to try and turn her against me. I just want him to go home. He never cooks and always waits till I\u2019m cooking and he comes into the kitchen whenever I am and eats what I\u2019ve made and when I buy my own shopping with my own money he goes downstairs in the middle of the night and eats it. I just want this guy to go home but whenever I ask my mum to take him she just won\u2019t. I don\u2019t know what to do. He doesn\u2019t even respect her and doesn\u2019t pay her anything when me and my brothers do. I can\u2019t stand being here. When my mums out he just stays around and doesn\u2019t leave the house and I just feel so uncomfortable and hate sitting in my room all the time because I don\u2019t want to be around some guy I barely know. He\u2019s said multiple things to her I don\u2019t like too like telling her she should change her hair colour and says certain perfumes she wears don\u2019t smell nice and just little comments all the time that aren\u2019t nice. My mums aware that he doesn\u2019t do anything but she still doesn\u2019t say anything. I just want better for my mum and I just want to be able to spend at least 20 minutes with her it\u2019s like he\u2019s completely isolated her from me and I don\u2019t understand whyOh and he was also at ours for my mums birthday and I didn\u2019t plan anything for me and my mum because I assumed he would do something with her but he never took her out or did anything special for her and only got her a card on the morning of her birthdayAlso let me and my brothers pay for a pizza for her and didn\u2019t chip in anything",

We\u2019ve been working on a major research project, and while we were supposed to have made a lot more progress by now, my group has been doing the most basic parts of the work. My group has been kind of a mess, with me being the youngest (just turned 17 in september), and the oldest being 21 (M). Everything was going fine until recently. I had been working hard, staying up late to meet the deadline, making sure all the research and papers were in order. I even reached out to validators to ensure everything was accurate. It seemed like we were on track. But then, my groupmate\u2019s grandmother\u2014who isn\u2019t even involved in the project\u2014decided to talk to the teacher. She claimed that I was making her granddaughter's life harder, saying that she doesn't get enough sleep and that it was my fault. She even went as far as saying that I \u201cordered\u201d her granddaughter to do all the work. Honestly, I was in shock. Last time I checked, the groupmate (18 F) barely showed up to meetings and was often out with her friends at the arcade. Meanwhile, I had bags under my eyes from staying up late working on everything. When my teacher asked about the situation, they were confused because I was always the one doing the work. The teacher even asked if my groupmate had contributed at all, and all I could say was \u201cI guess\u201d because I honestly didn\u2019t know how else to respond. I just stayed silent the rest of the day. After that incident, I stopped working with the group altogether and started helping other groups instead. I don\u2019t feel like putting in any more effort when they don\u2019t even acknowledge what I\u2019ve done. So now, the rest of the group is behind, and they\u2019re upset with me for not helping anymore. AITA for refusing to help my group after what happened with my groupmate\u2019s grandma?",

We were high school sweethearts, but ended up divorcing about 4 years ago. The divorce wasn\u2019t bad, but it was a divorce so it wasn\u2019t easy by any means.

We made eye contact, so I simply smiled and lifted my beer in a \u201ccheers\u201d motion to her, and she did the same. I never left my seat or even thought about it. My girlfriend saw me do this, and noticed who it was too, and kept talking to my buddies. Didn\u2019t think anything of it.

She will not travel for this funeral due to some social anxieties as well as fears and personal convictions about the current American climate and where the funeral will be.  I respect her decision not to travel but still intend to go to my brothers funeral.  I would be gone for 48 hours and set up everything for her and our child to be self sufficient while I am gone. I would never be unavailable in event of emergency. This is not a pleasure trip but one I feel a duty to complete.

I told her that even if it gets down to just her, our child, and I, we could still have a great time and make great memories. This has turned into a major fight now. I\u2019m on a throwaway because I have family on Reddit and they like this sub. My wife and I randomly and recently decided to plan a rather large vacation that would involve us (wife, child, and I) and bout of our parents. The dates were not set, but we had a general idea of when we wanted to go. I work in a job that isn\u2019t the easiest to get time off with, so I started getting the ball rolling on my end of things to make it easier for when I do have dates. This included changing and planning ConEd dates to allow for the possible window we would be going. Not a problem, just trying to make sure there are no hiccups when more concrete details come through. The other day, she tells me that due to some changes (nothing medical or financial), her parents may not be able to go with us. That soured her mood entirely about the whole thing. She became despondent and finally said that she thinks we just shouldn\u2019t go. I told her that I was sorry about her parents not being able to go, but that shouldn\u2019t stop us from going, even if my parents couldn\u2019t go either. This would be our first family vacation with our child and it would be a chance to make some special memories, especially since he will be about 2 by the time we go. She got quiet and eventually just said good night and walked away. Later on, she texts me about how upset she is by what I have said and that she does not want to talk about this until she is ready because she doesn\u2019t want to say things she doesn\u2019t mean. I have my own opinions about that, but I respected her wishes. I told her that it was not my intention to upset her and that I was sorry that I had.  I just want to know if I am being an asshole because I don\u2019t think we should cancel this trip over one cancellation? I saw this more in the light of it being focused on the three of us, but it seems like she was more interested in having her parents go than even letting our child have this opportunity. ",

        "selftext": "Okay I know this may sound bad but my friend and I (both 19 f) have been friends since we were 17, she's an amazing person most of the time and I would take a bullet for her no questions asked. However, lately her and her boyfriend (19 m) have been having some issues. I never liked her boyfriend to begin with, and my friend has always known that. Him and I have had our fair share of screaming matches since they got together and if I lacked the impulse control we probably still would. One thing I noticed when him and I would have these screaming matches is that he would tell me things that my friend hadn't told me.  Last week she called me at 7:00 AM to complain to me about her boyfriend for what felt like the hundredth time. I was sick at the time so hadn't been getting much sleep but looking back at it I honestly don't regret a word I said. I'll write how the conversation went but I will use fake names for privacy and respect. Me: Hey, I'm still pretty sick so I'm really tired right now, is everything alright?  Kayla: *sobbing* Dominic is being so mean right now, we were supposed to meet for coffee but we got into a fight this morning and now he won't talk to me  Me: Kayla just give it some time, try to breath and maybe you two can go for coffee tomorrow or do something later  Kayla: I don't wanna do it tomorrow I wanna do it today!  Me: I know, but Kayla I've tried to tell you before that when you two get like this it's not healthy and you both just need to give each other some space.  Kayla: This is so stupid, I don't get why he's like this  Me: I've tried to tell you multiple times that I honestly don't think you guys are right for each other, you call me like this almost every other day  Kayla: No I love him, we're just having a tough time right now.  Me: Kayla I'm sorry but I'm sick of this, you call me like this all the time for advice and you never listen. I've tried to help you multiple times but clearly you don't want help, you just want to complain and I'm not the person you should do that to. I've been way to stressed right now to deal with dumb things like these and you know it. I can't control you but I've tried to give you advice so many times, so if you don't wanna listen then I'm not going to either. You can take my advice or don't talk to me about him anymore.  Then she hung up the phone but I was to tired and to sick to care. I texted her later in the day apologizing for being so harsh but I told her my point still stands. She didn't respond so I left it at that but I've tried to text or talk to her about unrelated things and she's still ignoring me. AITA?",

Today I got asked why my cousin's kids will be getting less stuff and how I need to make more for kids I don't really know. I got to hear about how if I cared about my family I would put my cousin's kids first and make them feel special. I feel like it's fine for me to do what I am for the kids I care for (handmade heart purse with a custom card and custom sticker set based on the kid's interests). I know it's more than what my cousin's kids will get from me (custom card and 3 matching stickers), but I don't really know her kids. What am I supposed to do for kids I have met once that don't even remember me? I have no idea what the they are interested in, meanwhile I can tell you how the 9 year old I watch loves Minecraft and how whenever she plays she tries to find an axolotl to put in the house she made for me. I know the 6 year old I watch thinks I should cut my hair because she thinks short hair is the cutest and looks good on everyone.  (Btw the mother of the kid's I watch is aware I'm giving her kids Valentine gifts and is completely ok with it and the kids love when I do little things like that for random holidays.) ",

I talked to my parents and they said he needs to go in and see a doctor because if it\u2019s strep it could spread to his heart or kidneys, so i told him we need to go to urgent care and get tested. his family is lower income so i offered to pay for all expenses his mom was against going to the doctor (i didn\u2019t know) she wanted him to just take Tylenol and rest, I pushed for the doctor and he left without telling his mom, he picked me up and we went to urgent care we checked in I talked to the nurse she said we needed parental consent before they did any test (I had called before hand and asked if a minor could come in for a testing and they said nothing about parental consent for anything) so Ashton called his mom and handed me the phone since he can\u2019t speak so I asked his mom if she could give consent for the strep test she hung up on me as soon as I asked, so we called his dad next no answer. The nurse told us we should go to the ER because they don\u2019t need parental consent and she was worried because of how swollen his throat is. we left and he took me home and then he went home. his mom told him that \u201cif you dont respect me then you can pack your shit and live with her\u201d her being me. I understand his mom being upset with him leaving and going to urgent care with me and then just getting a call asking for consent on a test but at the same time it\u2019s her son and she should put his health over everything and now i just feel like she hates me and i don\u2019t know what to do to make things better. My dad texted Ashton and told him we would take him to the ER right now and Ashton said no because he would get kicked out of the house if he went so we offered to take him tomorrow while his mom is at work and he told me he doesn\u2019t want to go behind her back which I understand but i\u2019m very worried for his health and i just want him to feel better i\u2019ve spent the last two nights with him taking care of him and I know how much pain he\u2019s in I just don\u2019t know what else to do or how else to respond to this situation.   UPDATE: (his mom not wanting him to go in is not for any religious reasons)  His mom said she would take him this weekend if he doesn\u2019t get better but i am worried that it will be too long and things could get seriously dangerous for him i can\u2019t even see the back of his throat when i check.

        "selftext": "I live in an apartment on the second floor with my wife and dog. We've been here for over a year and we have never had any issues with the neighbors (A couple and 2 girls) living below us until recently. Back in November, a new couple and daughter moved in with the people down below us, but they aren't contractually living here. Couple A are basically subleasing, but they have 7 people and 3 dogs with them. The max capacity of the number of people in an apartment is 6 except for short gatherings. But ever since Couple B moved in here, it's been one problem after another. They keep slamming doors, kids AND adults are shouting, and husband of Couple B has been an inconsiderate prick parking his car in handicap and no parking spaces and revving his engine loudly at 4:30AM for the last few days. Back in December, I found out that husband in Couple B called the landlord to complain about our dog running around at 7:30 in the evening. So yesterday I called the police about his car not being registered here and being parked illegally so they came and wrote a parking ticket. But tonight they were banging on our floor/their ceiling and I tapped back with Shave-and-a-haircut to make sure it was ok. They tapped back so I assume nothing of it. We had been out all day, wife at work, dog getting fixed, me doing laundry at my sister's house. We just got a visit from the police claiming the people downstairs wanted to check on a domestic disturbance. My wife and I were sitting down and watching TV when they knocked. We were doing literally nothing and I'm wondering why they never come to me if there is a problem. I have never once made myself unapproachable to them. I've spoken to Couple A before and they seem genuinely nice. Ever since Couple B came in, issues keep coming up. I'm at my wit's end with these people and am wondering am I going about this the wrong way or do I need to make sure these guys genuinely get the picture that they are the ones that are not supposed to even be here?

I only drank one drink because I don't like being drunk on nights out.  Anyways torwards the end of the night, I saw this girl who I thought was super beautiful. I typically don't like imposing on other groups of people, however I indicated to her friend (we'll call her Beth) if I could get her attention. I said I thought she was beautiful and we just started a decent conversation (I'll call her Anna). I told Beth I liked a hair piece she had in and she said thanks. Anna & Beth started talking about some guy Beth was having troubles with and I apologised for eavesdropping but said screw him if he isn't going to treat you right.  I am a little traditional, and she was complaining that he lived five minutes away but didn't want to walk or drive the whole way to come to see her or meet her friends and she has to come to his.  Anyways before Beth left, she asked me for my instagram, and I politely declined saying I was interested in Anna.  Anna and I kept talking and I asked Anna if I could get her number and to take her on a date. Anyways I shot Anna a message, and she didn't reply for a few days. Then yesterday I received this text: Hey, my friend said you were chatting her up and when she turned you down you moved on to me. Kindly, It's better if you just focus on one girl you know for future endeavours I was taken aback so replied: Hey usually I wouldn't respond, but if this was your friend talking about guy troubles, she straight up lied.She asked for my instagram and I declined, because I was only interested in you.She should have read the room and understood that you had my undivided attention, and I was being polite to her because I felt bad that she was being disrespected by the guy she said she was seeing.I really liked your energy though, and you seemed genuine so l appreciate the message I also wished her well with something she told me she was doing.  I wish there was more to this, and I am a bit disappointed. On one side her friend lied about me, but on the other side it's her friend so I can't tell her not to believe her friend and it's improper for me to plead my case. I would usually never post this online, but I don't really care if anyone happens to see this, I'm just a naturally anxious person so felt a bit gutted but meh life moves on.

        "selftext": "I\u2019m a 27F married to Matt a 27F and we have been married for 4 years now and started dating when we were 19 years old. We met freshman year of college and stayed together both through college and grad school supporting each other in our journey and we are very very happy together and very much in love and living in a beautiful home. My parents as a grad school gift to both my husband and I took us out to a very nice dinner and gave us a surprise gift for a weekend get away. They really went above and beyond and we are beyond appreciative. That being said my MIL (she is a single mom) just pointing that fact out to show there isn\u2019t a FIL in the picture so I don\u2019t get any comments such as, \u201cwhy are you blaming the MIL and not the FIL as well?\u201d My MIL gave just my husband a card with cash and nothing to me. And yes it was made very clear this gift was just for him alone and it wasn\u2019t an assumed card for the couple if that makes sense. According to my husband the verbiage surrounding the card and cash was, \u201cI\u2019m so proud of you son for graduating I know how hard you worked towards your goal of graduating.\u201d I\u2019m very hurt I wasn\u2019t included in the card. It\u2019s not about me getting cash it\u2019s the fact this wasn\u2019t addressed to both of us as husband and wife when we are MARRIED and we literally both just graduated. To me it should automatically be second nature when the person your child has been with since your child was a teenager and who is his wife and DIL and they both achieved this milestone at the same time to include their name together on the card and just address it to the two of them as a married couple. It\u2019s not even like he graduated and got a solo gift from his mother and then I graduated a few months later and she overlooked me. We could at least chalk it up to well she may have forgotten but no in this case we graduated at the same time and so this feels more purposeful like only her son\u2019s hard work matters and is being recognized and not her. At the very least if she wanted to give her son a separate card I dunno I couldn\u2019t get a small bouquet of flowers, a $20 gift card to a local coffee shop, a card with a handwritten note. Something? My parents treated us both equally and like a married unit when we graduated and my MIL was very much aware of that fact.  My question is AITA for stepping back from our relationship and being a little more cold to her now because I\u2019m seeing I\u2019m clearly not as important to her as I thought? I could be the AH for freezing her out without knowing what she did to bother me.",

I have locs and haven't had the time for a retwist so I just told her I'm gonna twist it this week. She then says that I'm only wearing half a shirt. I was wearing a crop top and thought she was making a joke so I laughed it off and left to go finish running errands. Today I called and asked her if I could come in to get some bloodwork done (she is a nurse and I need a TB test for a job application). She told me I could as long as I didn't look a mess like last time. I was confused and asked what was wrong with my outfit to which she replied that it wasn't appropriate for her work. She said that my clothes were inappropriate, my hair was a mess, and it made me look dirty. I acknowledged that my hair wasn't done and then asked what was wrong with my outfit: a crop top and cargo pants. She told me that the look didn't reflect on her as my parent. I told her that I had dressed with her in mind: I wore a bra, no crazy makeup, and even wore the shoes she got me because I know she hates my favorite pair; but it still wasn't good enough for her. She holds me to too high of a standard that I don't ever expect to meet and I'm tired. She responded by saying that she holds all of her children to high standards because that's her job as a parent.  This is when I kinda lost it. My mom had me at 17 and I have never lived with her. I was raised by my great grandparents and although we have a rocky relationship, they have more claim as a parent than she does. I told her that she doesn't have the right to parent me and that anything I do reflect more on my great grandparents than her. This isn't the first time we've had an argument similar to this but for some reason I'm more angry than usual. To say that I look dirty and that it reflects poorly on her as a parent is absolutely wild to me especially given our relationship. ",

        "selftext": "I've been a long-time lurker and this is my first post, none of my other friends understand my situation (they got assigned single rooms) so I'm hoping to get a nuanced answer from Reddit. So I (19) share a room with Sara (19) in our college dorm. By sharing a room, I mean we live in a 12ft x 18ft room with two beds on either side. it's a co-ed floor, tho the rooms itself are single gender and there are separate washrooms/showers for men and women. We're allowed to have guests stay over, up to 3 nights a month so as long our roommate is ok with it.  Once a week for the past couple months my roommate's bf has been driving over to hang out with her once a week. This is fine, i didn't mind at first because they would go on cute dates outside but now it's getting super uncomfortable for me. So now that it's cold outside they're just in the room watching movies and hanging out all day. This means I have to either sit there awkwardly (which is unpleasant and awkward for the both of us) or I have to leave and find somewhere to go. Sara's never kicked me out but I can tell she would prefer if I left and it's uncomfortable for me to stay anyways.  Last Friday, I decided to talk to her and asked her what she and her boyfriend were doing the next morning and she said they were going to watch a movie and stay in. At this I asked her if she could go somewhere else with him. She seemed really confused and I explained to her that I felt kind of awkward being a third wheel and like i was intruding on them (they're super PDA as well). Sara got really mad and said that her half of the dorm was hers and she could do as she liked with it. I didnt know what more to say so I ended the convo. Her boyfriend came over yesterday and I think she told him I didn't like him there because he looked really awkward and I just ended up leaving. i also heard Sara on the phone to him in the hallway and she was joking about how I was probably in love with him and/or jealous of her. Now I feel kinda shitty and I'm regretting saying anything. What is dorm etiquette? Am I missing something?",

I'm talking massive pile the size of a large suv. They occasionally clean, vacuum, dishes, etc. Things that I consider to be at a minimum weekly. The house wreaks of cat piss and mold.

They know this and still want me to go up there to do something like take the trash out and all the other chores.  Here's where I am really having difficulty.

He was completely dependent on my parents to take him and pay for his alcohol. I didn't know how bad it truly was until he ended up in the hospital and the doctors said he would only have days to live. It ended up only being 1 day and I got there about an hour after he died. I know addiction is a hell of thing to deal with and also know that he ultimately made the choice to drink the way he did. I cannot seem to get the feeling that my parents are at least partly to blame for his death.  Every time I leave that house I feel completely emotionally drained.

        "selftext": "Hello! Longtime lurker, first time poster here. I (25F) went to a friend\u2019s wedding a few months ago. The friends are Matt (25M), and Susan (25F). We\u2019re all part of a much larger friend group that gets along pretty great. To preface, I have actually never attended a wedding before in my life, and I don\u2019t tend to dress up or put on makeup. Nothing against it, it\u2019s just expensive and time consuming and I work 16-hour days in a uniform. I was really excited when I got the invite, saved up, and went to a shop I know carries my size (I\u2019m fairly tall). The clerk was amazing and so helpful. He chose a selection of dresses that would be wedding appropriate that weren\u2019t close to what the bridal party would be wearing and we had a lot of fun trying things on and he hyping me up. One of the options I just fell in love with. It was a beautiful dark green silk \u201cbias-cut\u201d dress (think Kiera Knightley in Atonement, without the sash and less of a flowing skirt). We matched it with heels and I\u2019d never felt prettier. The dress was on sale too, so that was a plus! Wedding day comes and it\u2019s lovely. I\u2019m so happy for my friends. Susan ignores me, which is weird, but she\u2019s busy preparing and then the wedding is in full swing and the reception is busy so I don\u2019t think much of it. Everything goes off without a hitch and they drive off to their honeymoon. I suppose it\u2019s relevant, but I received several compliments on my outfit during the event. I didn\u2019t think it caused a scene, and it wasn\u2019t anything particularly effusive or over the top. I was doing the same to others so I didn\u2019t think it stood out.Everything concludes, we all have a nice time. No one says anything until tonight. We all got together for a \u201cWelcome Back!\u201d dinner for Matt and Susan. During the dinner Susan kept making snipes at me about what I wore, just incredibly passive aggressive. It was very clear she thought I overdressed. I didn\u2019t say anything at the time because I felt terrible. None of my friends corrected or stopped her either. But looking back on it I feel\u2026 wronged? She didn\u2019t give me the benefit of the doubt and I don\u2019t feel like my dress was over-the-top. I do think I likely look very different from how I normally dress and present myself, so that might be part of it?  I\u2019m trying not to go over the word limit but am very open to questions and elaborations if needed.  So Reddit, AITA?  TLDR: wore a nice dress to a wedding, the bride is angry ever since. AITA?  Alright, my update was way too long and I honestly don\u2019t know if I can shorten it and it still give all the details - so I\u2019m going to be posting it on my own profile. ",

        "selftext": "Hi. 18M. So, my family is tense right now. My younger half sister (13F) has gotten to the age where she is being quite rebellious. She\u2019s popular at school, and does well socially. The problem is, she\u2019s become an asshole at home. One this about me is that I have OCD and I\u2019m autistic. When it comes to food, I need everything to be clean and can be quite obsessive. I wash my hands frequently, and must ensure that cutlery and dishes are spotless before I use them. I make all my own meals because I don\u2019t like people touching my food. Okay- now onto the main bit. My sister has recently started doing incredibly disgusting things in the kitchen. Some examples:- Scooping out Nutella with her bare hands- Putting DIRTY cutlery BACK in the cutler drawer on the clean stuff- Putting used and dirty dishes on the clean stuff- Putting dirty cutlery in the clean dishwasher This hasn\u2019t happened once or twice. I\u2019d say this has happened over 20 times in the last six months and it\u2019s really upsetting me. I was always the black sheep of the family, and bullied quite a lot. If I bring up stuff like this I get called mean names. Today was a bit of a breaking point for me. I woke up, and went to empty the dishwasher. In the clean cutlery section, there was a dirty knife put on the clean ones. On top of that, there was a used cereal bowl put at the top, so all the excess milk spilt out on the clean ones. This really, upset me. I\u2019ve tried telling my mom to be stricter, and less relaxed about this stuff, but every time I do I get told I\u2019m being an asshole because my sister is \u2018still learning\u2019 or something like that, and that she \u2018has hormones\u2019 and that causes her to be more difficult.  I get it. I get that she\u2019s at an age where she\u2019s probably most rebellious and least thoughtful, but this stuff genuinely really upsets me. 2024 I experienced severe stomach problems due to stress, anxiety, and the fear of throwing up, and through therapy I\u2019m trying to do more behaviour experiments to help OCD- but stuff like this just validates my fears. I\u2019m trying so hard to move out. Am I being an asshole? Am I being to harsh? It feels like my sister is treated as the favourite. I have an older brother (25M) who moved out a few years ago, and me and him had a lot stricter rules. Imo the stuff she\u2019s doing is disgusting and unacceptable. I get she\u2019s only 13 but at that age I would have never even fathomed doing stuff like that- because it\u2019s not only gross but puts other people at risk. I feel really upset.  If this happened once or twice I\u2019d be more understanding, but this genuinely happens so frequently it\u2019s insane. Also, she\u2019s just as unthoughtful in other places- so many times I\u2019ve gone to take a shower to find it covered in hair product and hair. I\u2019m trying to be patient and understanding but I can\u2019t.",

        "selftext": "first some context... i stopped drinking back in 2023 and havent touched the stuff since. i wasn't an alcoholic or anything but rather id just react badly to any kind of alcohol.  a week ago me and my friends were making plans to do something together in the first time in a while for my birthday.  i was pretty excited and was looking forward to it especially since they said they wanted the party location to be a surprise.  when the day came and they picked me up from my place and we headed out. we had a blast for most of the day going shopping, to a restaurant, and even saw a movie together. after that point i was really tired but one of my friends suggested we go to a bar to keep the party going. i was ready to object because i dont like drinking but before i could the rest of my friends replied excitedly to the idea and i felt like id let them down if i said no so i also agreed.  one of my friends (who ill call kate) noticed i looked a bit unwell at the thought awhile we were on the way and she told me as soon as i wanted to go home that she would drive me since she had no plans to drink either. i appreciated that and started to feel a bit better. we got to the bar fairly quickly and immediately the other 3 friends i was with went straight to drinking. it was a saturday night so the bar started to get full after a little while and i was left alone with kate as the other 3 were mingling and dancing.   i was beginning to feel a bit overwhelmed with all the people since i was exhausted by this point and i think kate noticed that too and asked me if i was ready to head home. i tiredly nodded and got up to find the other 3 to let them know i was heading out, but couldnt find them. i sent one a text along the lines of today was amazing! thank you for the best birthday ever! i ended up getting too tired and was falling asleep at a bar table so kate is driving me home, she will be coming back though so she can still drive you three afterwards. have a great night! and shortly after we arrived at my home. i slept like a baby.  the next morning,  i wake up to messages from kate and the other 3. kate told me not to freak out, but that when she got back to the bar my other friends were furious that i had abandoned them after all they did for me that day. i actually felt terrible, but kate was telling me not to. i still apologized to the other 3 but only 2 of them has responded accepting the apology. the other one is still mad. she said  that, if i didnt want to go, that i didnt have to say yes in the first place, and i think i agree with that... ig the whole situation is causing some anxiety since i try really hard to avoid situations just like this. its sorta a nightmare and im at a loss if what i did was wrong or not. so... AITA?  Ps. kate told me to add this, but according to her they didnt ask where i was until after they gotten in the car with her to go home. ",

        "selftext": "I (21F) and my partner (22M) have been together for almost 5 years. We had mutual friends through school, so we\u2019ve basically grown up together. For extra context, I\u2019m autistic. I need structure and I like having things sorted way ahead of time. My partner is not, he just tends to \u2018go with the flow\u2019. Going on vacation together has always been a goal of ours. We were both absolutely certain we wanted to go on vacation in summer 2025. I brought up that we should get looking ASAP if we wanted a better variety of places to choose from within our budget. We both agree.  Throughout January, I\u2019m sending him links, sites, deals - all of which meets our \u2018list\u2019 of what we\u2019re looking for. He says yes to every one of them which I found odd. Surely you\u2019d have some preference, right? I assume he\u2019s eager to go and genuinely likes them all. Bare in mind we are both paying 50/50.  By the end of January, we still haven\u2019t booked because he keeps leaving things until last minute like telling his boss he\u2019ll need time off.I call him out on this as I\u2019m getting a little anxious, majority of the places we liked were now at capacity so those were off the table. I\u2019m worrying we won\u2019t find somewhere we both like if we don\u2019t get it booked soon and that he doesn\u2019t actually want to go anymore. He repeatedly assures me he wants to go and that he\u2019ll get it sorted with his boss, and he does - or so he says. Come February, we finally find our ideal place and book it, we\u2019re excited. A few days after, he says he\u2019s going to have to reschedule our vacation dates due to something at work.  This gets me angry. I told him beforehand that I cannot reschedule my time off work like he can, hence the \u2018nagging\u2019 him previously. I work for a big company, often short staffed and cannot take annual leave if someone else is off work at the same time, whereas he works in a quiet local bar in a small town mostly targeted at older people. After talking, he hadn\u2019t told his boss we\u2019d booked it, only that he was wanting to have time off around summertime and was looking into a vacation. He hadn\u2019t told or confirmed with his boss the dates we were looking at before we booked it, nor did he let him know as soon as we\u2019d booked it. He\u2019d left things until last minute again. To add, the rescheduling is because his boss is having a dispute with another business and it got moved. On occasions leading up to this, his boss has repeatedly said that it isn\u2019t important that my partner be the and is solely a preference because they are friends.  I told him I won\u2019t be going on vacation with him at all now because he refuses to prioritise things properly. If I can\u2019t trust him to complete simple tasks, then I can\u2019t trust him enough to fly to a different country with him, keeping in mind we have never travelled without our families before. I understand that he should be there for his boss, but he should\u2019ve confirmed these dates with him ASAP and take it seriously.AITA for being too extreme?",

Jake loves giving hugs and being otherwise very physically affectionate with all of his friends and I\u2019m not at all comfortable with physical contact due to personal reasons. We\u2019ve tried other solutions like using a hugging emoji instead because he feels like by not being outwardly affectionate he\u2019s not being himself at all. The hugging emoji started being worked into every text all the time and it began to make me increasingly uncomfortable and Jake unfortunately picked up on it. He got really upset with me and said that it\u2019s really unfair to him that I can\u2019t be more affectionate especially since I\u2019ve been really busy with work and other things lately as we haven\u2019t been able to hang out much. I honestly agree I feel like he\u2019s been trying to be someone he\u2019s not to make me comfortable but I don\u2019t know how to make myself more comfortable with either the emoji or physical contact. So would I be ta if I told him that I can\u2019t do either of those?

Sorry in advance if the format or phrasing is wonky, i'm on my phone, and English isn't my first language. For background info, I've been through 7 months of treatment for an autoimmune disorder, and because a handful of people (parents, siblings, a couple friends) wanted updates, i made a group chat where i could post whenever there was anything noteworthy to tell people, as it was easier and everyone could get the same info and answers, and i didnt have to stress about making sure everyone got the info. However, I have a third sibling (let's call her Jane), who I've never been close with. Our relationship has always been kinda bumpy due to mental health issues (she is autistic), and last we've chatted was in October last year. Prior to that, it'd been a year. She also has periods with very poor mental health, and can easily get a little overwhelmed or overstimulated. So when i made the group, if people dm'ed me asking for info, i'd throw them in there. I havent gotten a single message from her the entire time, and whenever the topic came up in conversation, she seemed indifferent at best, and honestly like she didnt really care. Yesterday, I was at the hospital and got the great news that we finally found a medication that worked (yay, no ileostomy for me for the foreseeable future!!), so I let people know in the chat, and then didnt think anything more of it. Until today, when Janette came by for a quick visit, and on her way out told me that Jane was upset I hadn't reached out to her and told the great news. When I told my mum why (I didnt want to burden Jane with the flip-flops of thinking the meds worked, then bad news, and honestly she didn't even bother reaching out to me in the first place, so why would i assume she wanted to be in there??), she doubled down and told me to just add her anyways. We ended on a slightly sour note, with me saying something to the effect of i didnt want to overwhelm her, and why would i add her, if she doesnt seem to be interested?, and my mum completely ignoring the isn't interested-part, but saying i'll tell her you didnt do it to protect her. Am I in the wrong for not notifying Jane? We barely speak at all, and I'm honestly a little confused why she wants that info, when she hasnt reached once this entire time. No phone-calls, no texts, not one message on social media. I haven't given her any info when trying out the other medications, so why would this be different??",

She never thought to make me sign a lease.  the house isnt big but theres 2 bedrooms. a few months ago I was asked if I would be okay with a new roomate. it was getting cold out meaning gas bills would go up, so I thought it would be great to have help.   I never saw this roomate after he moved in. a month later when I started noticing things like dirty shoeprints, unclean toilet, and garbage being left around the house. I was frustrated because whenever I knocked on his door to hopefully talk suddenly his tv would turn up and id get no answer. I always only ever knocked once and never pestered. I told Shelly about this and asked if she could talk to him for me. she told me she would however things took a direction that I didn't expect.  fast forward to last month. it was a Saturday and I was going to sit down and have some drinks awhile watching tv to reward myself for a promotion I got. I stayed up late watching movies when I hear my roomate go past my door towards the front at almost 4am. I also only realized in that moment it was nearly 4am so I turned my tv off to go to bed not thinking much of it. thats when i got a knock on my door.  I said hello? and heard Shelly. she asked me how I was and I told her I was drunk and about to go to bed hinting I didnt really wanna talk. she then opened my door.  I was taken aback but too dazed to really process what just happened. she then tells me that she talked to him and that shes come to the decision that she wants to evict me. I was startled since I don't have anyone to fall back on and the housing market is evil. if i cant find a house ill be on the streets. I asked why shes doing this and she tells me that during her talk he told her I was creepy and stalkerish but she didnt go into detail about what that even meant. she told me to be out of the house by 30 days then left. I couldn't go back to bed after that. I was too busy trying to find a new place to live because I didnt want to spend energy fighting in court unless necessary. thankfully about 5 days before i was expected to be gone I found a new house to rent. but if i were to pay my last months of rent I wouldn't be able to afford the damage deposit which needed to be paid before i was allowed to move in. I decided that, because of how she evicted me for no reason and there was no lease that I wasn't going to pay.  Its been only a week and shes gone out of her way to leave at least 3 hand written letters at my new place still damanding rent. when I talked to a few different friends about this ive gotten different responses. because of these mixed messages and some guilt im feeling for someone I knew since we were kids, im writing this post now.  So... AITA for not paying my last month of rent? ",

She has stated this throughout the years. And I have asked her in the past multiple times to talk to me about what\u2019s upsetting her instead of replying to me in her basically upset code words.She refuses. It\u2019s always those words by themselves. Me or someone else will text her full sentences and she\u2019ll respond with only \u201clol\u201d, \u201cyep\u201d or \u201cyeah\u201d.She never uses them unless she is upset. It could be however long and she won\u2019t use them for weeks, and then something will upset her and she will only use them to express she doesn\u2019t care about what the person is saying and that she isn\u2019t even caring enough to respond to it. This has always upset me. A few months ago I started to just delete the one word text where she responds with those words so that I can just move on from them and not get upset by them. Because it genuinely upsets me when that\u2019s the only reply I receive and that when I try to talk to her or ask what\u2019s wrong I\u2019m only given those in response. She recently used my phone to look up a recipe she sent me in the past, and in doing so saw our text from my side, where I had removed the text with one word text. She is upset and says that I\u2019m disrespecting her by removing them because they are still responses. Even if they aren\u2019t replying whatsoever to what was said and even if they are dismissing what was said, not to mention you only use them when you don\u2019t care to respond??I said it doesn\u2019t affect the conversations we have, it just keeps me from getting worked up because she uses them with no regard for how the other person feels. I just want to continue our conversations without seeing them because even if I ask about them she refuses to say anything.AITA",

        "selftext": "My best friend\u2014let's call her Elle\u2014and I have been close for 10ish years, and during that time, she's been in a couple of relationships but has been single for a few years now. Amongst our friends, Elle is the only unmarried one. She's made it clear that she's unhappy with being single, sincerely hopes to get into a serious relationship, and get married sooner rather than later. I can understand her frustrations, especially since she's the only single friend, wants kids someday, and so on.    About a month ago, Elle told me that she intends to be more proactive with dating this year and asked if I had anyone to introduce her to. Unfortunately, I don't, but another friend mentioned knowing a great guy (who I happen to have met before) who's single, and looking for something serious.  Elle was introduced (via text) to the guy, and they soon started talking on the phone. Elle says he has a lot of good attributes (e.g. very educated, high salary) but she finds him completely unattractive because they're the same height (he's 5'7 and she's 5'7) and because of his darker skin tone. I tried to convince her that his height and looks shouldn't take precedence over his personality, but this soon led to a major revelation on her dating standards that left me completely dumbfounded.   Elle told me that she's only interested in men who, in her words, is an 8 or better (looks-wise),  taller than her when she's wearing heels, of a certain complexion, ideally no beard, has advanced degrees, making over $100k/year, doesn't have kids, and is currently attending church every week or every other week.  But the big kicker that got me was that she insists that she's unwilling to date a man (like...go out on dates) who won't commit to waiting until marriage for sex. Yes, she's religious but she's not a virign and has had sex in all past relationships.    According to Elle, this is a conversation that should be had before even the first date, and if the guy isn't firmly agreeing, it's a no-go. When I challenged her thoughts and logic on this, she got increasingly upset.   I told her that I think she's asking for a very tall order, making dating harder than it should be. I'm not saying she should compromise on her religious values, but I am trying to tell her that she should be more open-minded about her criteria because she's looking for a one in a million guy, while also prematurely shutting down and shutting out some potentially great guys because of their income and/or height.    Elle is now furious at me and says I'm not being a supportive friend. She says that I don't understand her faith and am being something of a Debbie Downer. AITA?",

        "selftext": "TLDR; I\u2019m taking a day away from my husband and son to be comfortable with going back to work. Husband has never had a day alone with son so I asked him to try to figure it out but I\u2019ll be available if needed. He told his mother to come and help. I said no. He thinks I\u2019m ridiculous.  I (30F) and my husband (33M) welcomed our first child this past September. I have been fortunate to be on maternity leave but that ends next week. My husband had 2 months off and has been working full time since. He\u2019s off on Sundays and Mondays. I have never left my son except to go to a wedding in December but we were only away for 3 of his wake hours. My in laws watched over him and everything was fine.  I go back to work next week and my son will be attending day care. My husband is off this entire week and we\u2019ve just been taking a staycation. I told my husband though I want one day on my own to get more comfortable from being away from our baby and that I want him to have the day with the baby on his own. He has never been alone with him for more than an hour. He is a good father though and will help out when needed. But he has never been there for the full blown cries and fussiness while having to take care of the house.  A few days ago, we went to a friends house and our son was screaming bloody hell. Whenever I held him, he would calm down. Whenever my husband held him, he would just scream and cry even louder. So my husband just passed him along to me. I was getting frustrated cause I just wanted to relax with friends and he couldn\u2019t calm him down for a minute.  Today he tells me that his mom will be coming to help out. I asked him to tell her never mind cause he should be able to do it on his own. He called me ridiculous and it shouldn\u2019t matter but I think it really does. I can\u2019t be bothered at work unless absolutely necessary so I wanted t this to be our \u201ctrial\u201d. His mom will also be working on Mondays so it\u2019s not like she will be available to help out then. His mom is taking his side but of course she will cause our son is her only grandson.  So AITA for telling husband to figure it out and step up?  This is my first AITA post and I\u2019m frustrated just writing this so if you need more details to decide, just let me know and I\u2019ll respond.  ETA- I had a c section and I exclusively breastfed so I physically could not leave the baby in the first 2 months. My lactation consultant told me not to pump until after 2 months as I needed to establish my milk supply. He took care of my while I took care of baby. He doesn\u2019t do NOTHING. When I started pumping, husband was already at work. Husband does do feedings now.  ETA2 - this isn\u2019t a punch towards his mother. I adore her. It\u2019s really about him being independent with the baby. She helps us and I always appreciate it. Idk why yall think I\u2019m spiteful.  ETA3 - When my husband is home, I do separate myself from them by going to a different room. But he does often come to the room for help. I\u2019m not just dropping him off. ",

        "selftext": "Backstory: My older sister has been single for over a decade and the past few years has been basically in love with her mutual friend for several years, but he's been engaged to another woman for the past 2 years. Over the holidays he emotionally cheated on his fianc\u00e9e (did sexual stuff online with a stranger) and she understandably broke up with her and ended their engagement over this past New Year's. After the breakup, my sister met up with him as a friend to hear about the breakup and hang out, but I guess once they did that, he suddenly started to develop feelings for my sister and now they're basically dating but not officially yet.  She told me that he struggles with his mental health and he's seeing a therapist and on medication now, and she told me that he SAID he wanted to take 3-4 months off dating but now over only a few hangouts, him and my sister are basically together now which I feel like is SO fast and this man really moved quickly. I want to be happy for my sister because she is finally with the guy she likes a lot, but it feels icky how fast this all happened, especially because he was the cheater in the last relationship.. My cousin is getting married March 15 and now she wants to bring this new guy to the wedding. \ud83d\ude43 The wedding is here in FL where I live and my sister lives in Virginia, and usually when she visits I let her stay in the guest room and in my condo with my husband and I. But now that she is insisting on bringing him to the wedding, regardless of whether my cousin can accommodate him or not at the actual wedding, he is still coming with her to visit my whole family for the first time. I feel like all of this is happening way too fast, maybe it's just me because I have a hard time with change, but am I an asshole if I don't feel comfortable letting her and her extremely new boyfriend stay at my place?

        "selftext": "Context: I'm 16M, currently living with my dad and step-mom + 2 older step siblings (Male and female). I do have a biological older sister who is currently living with my mom. My parents were divorced a long time ago when i was still pretty young (idk how old i was), i was living with my mom and sister for most of my younger days and would visit my dad's house during the weekend up until i was around 9 or 10 before i fully moved in with my dad and my new step-family after they asked me to. I used to be a naughty kid since I used to whine and act all bratty towards my step-siblings sometimes, so I'm not exactly close with them whatsoever even until now, but we're on okay terms even if we don't talk often. My step-mom doesn't exactly treat me in a 'bad way' but she does scold me sometimes, and she does speak things/complain out loud pretty blatantly about me sometimes that makes me feel upset. I try not to think about it much since I'm pretty sure this would be normal for some ppl, but I still can't get used to the fact she does this and i don't feel comfortable listening to it.My mom basically comes to visit me at school every week after school just to give me cash, sometimes she also gives me snacks, even asks about my well-being, including questions if I'm ever going to hang out, sleepover, or even move back with her to which i said no to. Usually whenever i come home, i tell my stepmom about my mom visiting (either that or my parents would ask), and i include how i declined most of my mom's invites (since I'm sure my dad nor my stepmom would yap on about it in a not so good way, so i just give them the only answer that'll satisfy them). Also, my parents don't like me bringing stuff my mom gave me back home, because apparently she laced them with weird stuff in it (that's what my step mom says). And i also don't have my mom's number (because my dad wouldn't let me), so we don't contact online. Until now my parents' relationship still isn't okay because of finance as far as i can tell As of recently, I've been beginning to think about whether i should actually move back with my mom. Sometimes i feel like i don't belong with this 'step-family', like I feel like a burden at home and i feel like everyone else would be better off without me, especially with the way my stepmom treats me (even if it isn't intentionally supposed to make me feel upset). But just to be clear, both my moms have done the bare minimum of what any mom does like cooking and cleaning.  I guess i want to move back with my mom mainly because i still see her as a more 'mother-like figure' since she's more physically affectionate, and also for financial reasons since I'm starting to doubt things are gonna get any better if i live any longer with my dad after we basically moved to a new but smaller house that practically belongs to my aunt and even sold his car. Which might be an A-hole move to do. So WIBTA if i moved back with my mom? ",

        "selftext": "My cousin S and I were incredibly close since childhood, despite our five-year age gap. We were confidants\u2014or so I thought. Last July, S started dating A, and their relationship accelerated rapidly. A, recovering from a difficult breakup, seemed like a breath of fresh air. They decided to marry just 4-5 months into their relationship. Her parents initially opposed the match. I supported S, believing A was a good person. I even argued with her parents, and my mother\u2014S's aunt\u2014also fought for her within the family. S had lived with us for over a year during her studies, during a time of significant financial hardship. My mother showed her extraordinary care, arguably more than she demonstrated towards her own children. After months of drama, her parents finally blessed the marriage. Then, S dramatically changed. She became self-absorbed, obsessing over her wedding while excluding everyone. It felt like she used our family to get what she wanted and then discarded us. During this period, two young family members passed away. In our culture, such losses typically mean avoiding celebrations for a year. S showed no emotional response and set her wedding date merely 8-9 months after their deaths\u2014an action many found extremely insensitive. Her behavior grew increasingly hurtful. She got engaged without inviting me or my mother, claiming it was a surprise\u2014despite numerous relatives and friends being present. She visited my city multiple times, deliberately avoiding including me. She scheduled her wedding the day before my brother's critical board exams, knowing he would need my study support. Her communication became manipulative. She'd send lengthy midnight messages portraying herself as struggling and lonely, repeatedly asking if I was upset. She changed her bachelorette venue last minute, ensuring I couldn't attend, and instead went out with friends. These actions made me feel she was more interested in maintaining a facade of closeness than genuinely being present in our relationship. Considering these circumstances, I've decided to skip her wedding. In Indian wedding culture, RSVP isn't standard, so I plan to make a last-minute excuse. Am I the asshole?",

This is my first ever post on here so sorry if the writing is a little iffy\u2026I (16 at the time, F) was invited to hang out with my friend (18 at the time, F) and her boyfriend (19, M). We went to the mall first and everything seemed to be fine. (We\u2019ll call my friend Sam and he bf Jack) Jack was a good guy, super friendly and funny. I thought he seemed really good for Sam. We ended up in Hot Topic, looking at all the random things we wanted but didn\u2019t need. Jack picked up a little among us blind bag and showed it to us asking if he should get one. I laughed and told him we should all get one as a \u201ctoken of our friendship\u201d I was mostly kidding because I hadn\u2019t known him very long but he bought three of them anyway. Once we were done at the mall, Jack suggested we all go get dinner since Sam was getting kind of moody. We went to a local mexican place (so so good) and we all just chatted while we ate. At this point I\u2019m having a pretty good time and definitely approve of the relationship (the whole reason I was there pretty much). Once we finish eating Jack and Sam drive me home. I open up my little blind bag and show them the among us guy I got. We all laughed at the funny little plastic toys and then I said my goodbyes and asked Sam to hang out again soon. She said yes and seemed totally fine at the time\u2026 That is until about a week later when I find out Sam has blocked me on almost everything without a word. I wasn\u2019t too put off at first as I know she\u2019s done this to many people in the past due to mental health problems so I never got in the way. I brushed it off for about a month until I was hanging out with a mutual friend, Taylor(17, F) and she told me everything. Apparently Sam thought I was being way too friendly with Jack and that I was going to try and take him from her (which would be illegal as I was 16 at the time and he was 19.) Sam decided she\u2019d rather break off an almost 5 year friendship than \u201crisk\u201d losing some guy she met on Tinder a few months back.  For context: This story is from a few years back but I wasn\u2019t on Reddit then and it still doesn\u2019t sit right with me.  So, am I the asshole? (Feel free to ask any questions!

I also removed her on all socials. Her boyfriend and mine are obviously aware of this, and my boyfriend is not her biggest fan as a result of this (and his best friend is aware of how we both feel about her as they spoke after).  Now were planning the party and lots of our friends have significant others who are invited to the party. We didn't specify on the invite whether plus ones are allowed, we just used an app to manually invite everyone (including s/os who's numbers we had) and then those who are bringing someone we dont know just add their own plus one. I'm not sure if we need to pre-emptively clarify to him that she's not invited? WWBTAs if we don't send her an invite? We obv have her number so when we send out the app invites, he will get one and she wont and they will be able to see that other s/os got one (the app shows  a list of invitees and their RSVP status to everyone).  (i would personally expect them to not invite me and I wouldn't go even if i was), I'm also concerned that if we invite her to be polite she'll think everything is cool (it is not) and I also don't want to set the precedent of her expecting an invite to other special events like birthday or weddings etc?

        "selftext": "This backstory is important for it to make sense later - My dad already died 11 years ago and he was adopted when he was a baby, someone left him on his adoptive parent's door. His parents named him and used their surname for my dad. In my country, it is illegal to add your surname to the adopted kid. But it was back in 50s, nobody cares that much.  My dad is the only adopted kid and the eldest of 5. Although he was adopted, he really loved the family and worked really hard to support them. He also had to leave his dreams behind just to support his small siblings. The siblings knew how hard my dad worked his ass off.  Grandparent already died as well 20+ years ago and left some inheritance. My dad was part of the inheritance due to having the same surname. My dad was promised by their siblings that he would get his portions. The inheritance took years to process due to missing documents etc.  All was good, untillll, my dad died. His siblings decided to remove his name from the inheritance saying he was adopted and not qualified to get the portions. His siblings kept pestering us to tell the lawyers the truth and back out from the inheritance. To be honest, we didn't care about the inheritance, but the way they treat us after my dad died, it hurts us. We felt being betrayed and who knew, just because of inheritance, they throw us like some trash. If my dad was here, surely he would be depressed seeing how his siblings treated us. He really loved them.  And since that moment, I vowed myself and let my family know that I will not join any family events and do not want to see them anymore. My siblings agreed, and my mom too agreed, but since she is the oldest sister-in law, she had to join the family events just to respect my dad. My mom told me that if my dad was here, he would want his family to be here to celebrate my wedding, and out of respect to my beloved dad, I should invite them. But I stand firm on my decision, they didn't respect my dad after he died, so why should I? I know, not inviting them will get them on nerves and will keep pestering my mom if I didn't invite them. And people will talk and it will look bad on my mom and my late dad. I really don't want my parent to get the bad reputation just because of I hate them. Buuutttt, I really don't want to invite them, I know I will have bad mood through out the wedding if I see their faces. And no, I am not close with the cousins. So I really don't mind. WIBTA?  ",

        "selftext": "Okay sooo first of all here's some necessary info about this. I'm 15f, freshman in a boarding high school. I share a dorm with two roommates, one which I'm gonna call M and the other one S. We're all the same year. I have ARFID and am anemic, which causes me to be often low on energy.  Sooo like the title says, I'm not going to eat with her. M is always begging me to go and eat (or just wait) there for like 15 minutes. We have three meals every day, breakfast before our school (which starts at 7:30 most of the time), lunch which is like riiight after school, and the dinner which is at 18:00. Usually, S goes with her, but she also has other friends so she often ends up not going with M. I do sometimes go with her, but it's just awkward because I can't really eat most of the things there because of my eating disorder, so I just take the tiny yoghurt and wait there while she or they're eating.  Most of the time when M asks me to go with her, I say no. I just don't have the energy to get ready and go be around people for 20 minutes while she's eating. She keeps asking maany many times,  and my answer is pretty much always no, since I buy myself stuff I like at the store and am not hungry. M, on the other hand, doesn't have as much money so she needs to eat at the caffeteria. Whenever i tell her to just eat without me, she says how she's embarrassed to go there alone. After begging me for a bit, she finally gives up and stops asking, but doesn't end up going to eat at all.  But I'm starting to feel a bit, I don't know.... Bad? Like, she's not eating because of ME basically. I don't know what to do\ud83e\udd79 ",

Fast forward to 2024 in July I had my second child, from then I felt like things were getting a bit weird like the vibe but I had terrible postpartum with my second and was dealing with a lot (still am) so I thought it was just me. We played online games together a lot and she got me into a co-op game we could play with teams and such working around our time differences was hard but we figured it out, I had found out on of my friends from my town also played so I would load up a round or two with them, I had mentioned to my long distance friend about her before and she seemed to have no problem with the idea playing as a team. There was this one day though where I messaged both of them if they wanted to run a game, I got an answer from my in town friend and they were down, waited for a bit to see if my long distance friend would answer and there was no response so I loaded up anyway. 2 hours later I get a reply on SC in the middle of my match, I did open it with the intention to reply after I died but I forgot, I did message her about something random that same night but no response so I went to bed. The next morning I get a text about how I ignored her and that\u2019s why she didn\u2019t answer me back that night, I apologize and said I totally didn\u2019t mean to forget to message her back but she didn\u2019t see it as I forgot but that I purposely ignored her. I tried to explain that\u2019s not what had happened but she felt I was being defensive when she was trying to express her feelings and if I didn\u2019t mean to do it why did I do it anyway. To me she was stuck on this feeling of being ignored and didn\u2019t want to hear anything else so I stopped answering, a couple days passed and she texted me about how I have made her feel ignored and unappreciated, that nothing she said mattered and I was acting differently. Again I had a baby in July of 2024 so I wasn\u2019t gonna pay any attention to that cause I had 2 kids now and not just one so my priority had changed and I wasn\u2019t gonna apologize for that (my kids will always come first). I still don\u2019t think I did anything wrong but she\u2019s definitely trying to make it seem like I did. So AITA",

So me and Bianca had been friends for almost 2 years and were so close, we would do everything together and I had been around for any guy she showed interest in but when she got with Ean I noticed Bianca didn\u2019t hang around me as much. I didn\u2019t mind since I know couples always have that phase of being obsessed with eachother so I brushed it off. Eventually we became a small group of us three and would hangout together, it was fine for a while and I even had eans number incase we needed to be in contact (for birthday planning, valentines gifts for bianca etc etc) we had barely texted maybe once or twice but always about Bianca. One day I was out at target and I was down the street from Bianca\u2019s house so I had planned on getting her a gift and bringing it to her but she wouldn\u2019t answer my calls so I texted ean to ask if she was home or with him and he just told me she was home but probably with family and wouldn\u2019t answer which was fine. I then asked him if he could text her mom for me as me and her mom don\u2019t have a great relationship and he asked why, now here is where the problem comes in. I didn\u2019t think anything of the story so I told him that her mom didn\u2019t like me because me and Bianca had been hanging out at her house on time and her parents overheard us watching Instagram stories and our schools fight page but I didn\u2019t know my headphones were still Bluetooth connected and they heard everything. Now after I told him that story I went on with shopping until about 10 minutes later a for a message from Bianca calling me a backstabbing b*tch and that I told Ean that she was talking to other guys. I was incredibly confused as I had not done that whatsoever so I texted her asking what the hell are you talking about? Now she stopped answering after that text and did not want to hear me out so I turned my phone off and went home sobbing to my mom as I don\u2019t like fighting with my friends. Eventually a few hours later Bianca texted me saying Ean had lied to her and threw me under the bus because he was suspicious of her and thought she was cheating on him and only said I told him she talks to other guys to see if she would confess. She apologized and said she shouldn\u2019t have fought with me but when I told her that he is insane and manipulated her and my story she said I was being unfair and dramatic and she wants to stay with him and make it work but still be friends with me. I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m being unreasonable and they should break up. Am I the asshole for saying that? ",

He clearly didn\u2019t like it because it was long and flowy and went on a rant about his preferred choice of wig. At the end, we concluded on getting a wig we\u2019d both like.  However, I was visibly upset because I felt we always have to put his preference first even when it\u2019s about a gift for me. I wasn't even upset about not getting my wig of choice, I was upset because I tend to put his feelings ahead of mine and the one time I really wanted something, I still had to compromise.  If it were based on other reasons like budget, I wouldn't even mind forgoing it completely.  It just really sucked because I put a lot of thought into what I\u2019d get him solely based on what he likes.  He got upset that I was upset and now it\u2019s quite clear I wouldn\u2019t even be getting a wig at all.  He said some hurtful stuff and is making me out to be a bad person for being upset. I feel so heartbroken,I've cried so much my eyes are puffy.  Despite all of these and my numerous explanations, he's convinced I'm upset of a silly wig. AITA in this situation ?",

To put it in perspective, she just got a cold and she gets sick quite often. I also get sick often but not as much. She's an athlete and very into running and fitness, and I, however don't like it as much and i just do a bit of gym for fitness. So when she was complaining about being sick, I was empathizing with her and mentioned weak bodies unite as we both get sick. She, however, replied with ew i wouldn't want to be united with you. That kind of hurt me. I felt as if I was being looked down upon and since I know a few people already look down on me, it hurt a lot considering it was my best friend, my gf. So the day after, which is today, I mentioned this topic to her, and I said I felt hurt. She then said she only said it jokingly, to which i replied she's said jokes like these quite a few times. She then said they're jokes only, and that I should know better than that, that she wouldn't mean it to me ever and then walked off(she was already feeling kind of sick at that moment).

Keith used forearm crutches while I used a cane. Due to our conditions, we walked towards the back of our group. Neither of us had issues with this fact, however the teachers on this trip did. The second day of this trip, two teachers asked us to move to the front. The theory was that us walking in front would set the pace for the group. However, it instead made group members annoyed with us and did nothing. Multiple group members glared, muttering about it being unfair and it ended with everyone walking around us. The teachers started this by calling out, Hey slowpokes. After we shared our disdain for that they proceeded to call us, The ones with the third legs They also called us, Pace makers and Pace Setters Each time the group would move again, attention was brought to us as we were forced to the front. We tried to explain that this was not working out and was only causing more problems. Not only was the group annoyed with us, but we felt the need to walk faster, actively harming ourselves. The teachers refused to listen. Keith finally snapped at the teachers.They tried to force us to the front once more and we refused, saying it wasnt working. They stated that they didn't care if we didn't want the attention on us and to just move to the front. Keith snapped, yelling that it was not doing shit and they had no say over this matter. We were immediatley pulled aside. The teacher lectured us saying that we would not talk like that here but also that we are disabled and have to prove ourselves to the others and make them understand, ending with we are all on the same side. We both put our mobility aids away, but still ended up towards the back.Edit for clarity: We both have Eds and Pots which is why we use mobility aids. While we don't 'need' them to go places, without them we are both in immense pain and risk fainting. So we are able to walk short distances without mobility aids.",

I was genuinely interested in a new one because can\u2019t stand my old old one because the smell brings me back to memories of an incredibly hard time in my life, and I associate my old one with a past relationship. But I had restocked recently and been gifted so I was dead set on not buying anyone for years tbh.But flash forward and for our 6 month anniversary my boyfriend got me the same perfume as my best-friend. Which i thought was incredibly sweet because he didn\u2019t have to do something so big for a 6 month anniversary but he wanted to, and because he remembered that one time i mentioned how much I liked it. It really was the cherry on top of an amazing weekend and I was really excited about it and our relationship in general.Until, my best friend found out and is actually quite upset. She says she \u2018doesn\u2019t even want hers anymore\u2019 and said I should\u2019ve returned it (my boyfriend opened it for me to it\u2019s not returnable). I completely understand wanting a \u2018signature sent\u2019 (a phenomenon i think like most, my boyf has no clue exists) and would\u2019ve never have gone out of my way to buy it. However, I was gifted it, and it was a really sweet meaningful gift to me. I feel like it\u2019s kind of fucked up to insist I return the gift, not to mention I was having a very hard night (computer broke and missed a v important academic deadline) when the topic arose. I feel like it\u2019s a little understandable to a bit upset, but not to demand I return it and then go silent and passive aggressive, when i\u2019m already having a hard time. I feel like it kinda lends itself to a broader theme lately of her treating me unkind. Am I crazy for feeling that way? Am I the Asshole?",

        "selftext": "So let me start off with I'm pretty bad at checking the details on my bank statements, but recently something wasn't right. So I went through every single one for the past year, and there were over 100 charges from PlayStation. I only had 4 purchases on my 2 PS accounts in a single year, so I panicked as someone had my cc info. In all, the total charges were around 1500. I contacted both of my siblings who's kids also have accounts and asked nicely if their kids may have purchased anything using my bank account before i make a dispute. Both said no, so I went ahead and called both PS and my bank. The bank was able to chargeback past few months and rest is under investigation. Well a few days later I get a frantic call from my teenage nephew who says his PS account was perma banned. I asked him if he was sure he didn't buy anything with a cc after I gave him a several hundred dollars PS giftcard for his birthday this summer to spend on stuff, he again denied. So I have his email logins and sure enough, it was purchases he made to his account. All the stuff he plays. Then he starts to say maybe he bought a few items here and there.  Now my sister is pissed at me. She says I must have added my cc info to buy him something at some point in time, and it was all my fault he was making purchases from my card. If it were her cc, she'd get an alert. Never that he may have taken my cc info, no. She doesn't want him to lose his account, and said she'll call PS to pay for it all. She said he always asks and she gets alerts and doesn't understand that I didn't, so I shouldn't blame him. I said well he knew he was spending someone else's money, so why is it my fault? And that he stopped asking her for permission to make purchases because no one stopped him. After that she said I was blaming her kid for everything. So AITA here? ##Edit:  Info:He is almost 15.I'm unsure of how he got my payment info. ##Update! After an intense argument, she was still denying he made the charges at all. I was finally able to show her each and every transaction (before I had only explained and she didn't believe me). After seeing the evidence, he finally fessed up. He claimed he thought it was HER card \ud83e\udd2a. She will be paying me for all the money he used on my account and will not be getting the PS5 back, until he works to pay it off. Even then she may not let him have it. He insists that he will be paying us both double for our troubles. But the real damage done here is the trust I have in both of them.",

I was still recovering from the shock of finding out what she had been doing behind my back, so I decided to demote her from MOH (and replace her with my sister). My best friend was still going to attend as a guest. She was upset at this but accepted. I thought things were good, but, last week, I found out she was talking behind my back and saying unpleasant things (she was calling me ungrateful, a biatch, mean, bratty, and other immature names). I flipped out and uninvited her from the wedding immediately. The wedding was only three weeks away at the time I uninvited her, so she said I messed up all of her plans by doing so. I do feel bad that it was so abrupt, but I didn't feel comfortable seeing her on what is supposed to be my happiest day anymore.  The wedding is on a weekend and the venue is 2hrs away from her house, so she didn't have to take a vacation to attend or anything like that, but I know cutting her out so close to the date was not the nicest move. AITA? Edit: typo",

        "selftext": "I (19F) draw. In 2023 I noticed I make more $ w/ furry art. Once I began learning to draw anthros, I made myself a fursona to help me practice. A year ago my lil bro (16M), who we'll call B wanted to make one too for funsies. I've posted lots of art of his sona on my Instagram since then w/o issue. On my art accounts I use a name that isn't mine irl. I do this for my/B's privacy. I've never mentioned B by name before. He's called brother & my followers are my own friends +strangers.He's told me he doesn't want his friends to see my furry art. He's embarrassed/ashamed of it. I'm comfortable with what I do tho & don't need validation from teens. B lives with my dad 3hrs away, none of our friends overlap, so my followers aren't a sign of mine/B's identity. Only way to find my account is to search for it directly or be following my main (which is private) & finding info about it there. B's friends can't see my account unless he shows them or they're already following it; which means they would know what I draw & are okay with furry art.Yesterday B's bestie saw a post on my art dump Snapchat story (which she joined of her own accord) about how I became a furry artist & today B's been ordering me to delete him from everything. He wants there to be no evidence of him on my Insta account in case his friend goes to snoop. He sent screenshots of posts he wanted edited, including one that wasn't even furry art; just an OC he'd made. I asked him why that one & he just insisted all evidence deleted. I argued that on all images of his sona he's not named (btw I have 3 bros so brother doesn't even directly implicate him). & that on most posts the descriptions just mention how he made critiques/suggestions on what to draw w/o any inclusion of the fact that the OCs are his.He said he told his bestie that he didn't know about the characters, so including him at all would get him in trouble. While arguing, I was still making the edits cause I do respect his privacy even if I think his reasoning is bs.I told him I deleted him but that next time he wants to order me around he has to pay me like everyone else; if he wants to make these demands & be the boss he has to hire me.He said wow, so now you don't even respect if people want to be anonymous for personal reasons?. That pissed me off. I told him that I do respect privacy & I have many people I mention using an alias for that very reason. What I don't appreciate is being ordered to go through a year's worth of posts & edit them because he's insecure & hateful. That up until now I had done all his art for free & I don't appreciate the bossy attitude & lack of respect for /me/. So again, if he wants that power, he can pay me for all future art just like everyone else.He thinks I'm being unreasonable/that I'm wrong for posting about him to begin with (tho he's never complained til now).Edit: I had his consent all long, he just freaked out & got demanding/rude today. tl;dr: bro bossed me around, I told him if he wants that privilege he needs to be a paying client.AITA?",

        "selftext": "So, I (20sF) work at a restaurant, and I recently found out that one of my coworkers, **\u201cLena\u201d** (also 20sF), has been talking behind my back for a while. Apparently, she\u2019s been making comments about me being lazy, slow, and not doing my job****\u2014even though our manager previously told me I was one of the **strongest** employees on the team before he started hearing complaints from my coworkers. The thing is, **none of these supposed issues were ever brought up to me directly**. I had no idea anyone even had a problem with me until I found out that Lena had **been the one stirring the pot and turning people against me.** Meanwhile, to my face, she\u2019s been nothing but friendly, which makes this all feel especially fake and petty. When I learned what she was saying, I debated how to handle it. I considered: 1. Ignoring it and pretending everything was fine.2. Pulling her aside for a direct conversation.3. Writing her a **short, professional note**, since she never gave me the courtesy of addressing issues directly with me. I decided that **option 3** might be the best way to handle it\u2014giving her a **calm but firm note** that says:  *\u201cI heard some things have been said about me, and I want to address it directly. If there was ever an issue with my work, I would have appreciated you coming to me first instead of spreading it around. Moving forward, you don\u2019t have to pretend to like me or make friendly small talk, so let\u2019s keep things strictly professional. Hopefully, this is the outcome you wanted.\u201d* I plan to fold the note neatly, seal it with tape, and **hand it to her without saying a word**\u2014then walk away for my break, leaving her to process it. I feel like this avoids unnecessary confrontation while still making it clear that I\u2019m setting a boundary. However, now I\u2019m wondering if this approach might be too passive-aggressive or dramatic. I don\u2019t want to **stoop to her level** or make things worse at work, but I also don\u2019t want to let her think I\u2019m just going to sit there and take it. I'm a very introverted person but I think a lot of ppl mistake that for passiveness and see me as an easy target, but who knows? So, **WIBTA if I give her this note instead of speaking to her directly?** **EDIT:** To clarify, I was never given any feedback or complaints about my work before this. If someone had a real issue with me, I would have **gladly fixed it**\u2014but they never gave me that chance. Instead, they just gossiped and tried to ruin my reputation.",

        "selftext": "I (25F) am child-free so maybe there is some aspect of parenthood that I\u2019m missing here. My friend Stacy (26F) had her first baby about 9 months ago,  Hailey. Stacy and I had some tension brewing in our friendship since she was pregnant. In the past, my time and energy had been very much available to Stacy. At times I felt that she took advantage of my empathy and willingness to bend over backwards for her. She lived about an hour away, and was always in some form of drama or crisis. I drove up to be with her nearly every single weekend, and the times when I told her I couldn\u2019t for one reason or another, she would beg and usually guilt me with things like \u201cI\u2019m in such a dark place, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll do if I\u2019m alone, I really need this\u201d. She also did a lot of passive aggressive shutting down from conversation when she didn\u2019t get what she wanted, leading me to always give in and put my own needs aside. This went on for years. I grew tired of this pattern and started therapy, where I learned to set healthy boundaries, speak up, and prioritize myself when it was important. These changes led me to cut the weekends I spent with her in half. I was in the process of buying a house, starting a new job and masters program, on top of family issues. I knew that she saw the change in our friendship and wasn\u2019t happy about it, but thought that with time she would understand and adjust. She never did, and insinuated that I changed because I didn\u2019t support her pregnancy or because my partner was manipulating me into not spending time with her. I explained to her many times that this wasn\u2019t the case and that I am doing all I can to be there for her.  Things came to a head when I had a health scare. I told her about it, and the next day she tried to call me. I was on the phone with someone else and couldn\u2019t answer, but texted her immediately after to let her know and make sure that everything was okay. She once again got upset because I didn\u2019t answer right away, and I had had it. On the very rare occasion that I ask for support from her she had to make it about herself. I didn\u2019t usually call her out but this time I did. I told her I didn\u2019t understand why she had an attitude, she said \u201cthanks for making me cry\u201d and then didn\u2019t respond to me for over a month. Then, when she finally did, she didn\u2019t ask about my health. She didn\u2019t apologize or even bother explaining. She instead accused me of using her daughter as a pawn by not acknowledging her. She said that Hailey didn\u2019t deserve absolutely no effort just because her and I were in a fight, and that it was so messed up that I would add Hailey into the equation. I\u2019m so confused. Hailey had nothing to do with the fight, and Stacy was the one who had ignored me for over a month. What was I supposed to do in this scenario? I can\u2019t text a 9 month old or just show up at their house. I\u2019m genuinely lost, can someone please explain this to me? AITA? \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-(EDIT) Update:Thank you for all of the comments and advice! I especially appreciate the vulnerablility of those who shared their experiences from both sides of this situation. Stacy and I have been friends for a decade, and I have long speculated that Stacy\u2019s behavior stems from her past traumas and mental health. This is a huge reason I could never bring myself to abandon her or criticize the ways she copes with life, albeit unhealthy. Although I can empathize with her experience and care about her deeply, you all helped me see that with no end in sight, it\u2019s not a sustainable friendship for me to continue. I decidedly to be brutally honest with Stacy and of course, things ended in flames. I explained that her using Hailey to guilt trip me was manipulative and crossed the line, and that it is reflective of her behavior toward me throughout our friendship. I have done my best to be a good friend but find it impossible to meet the expectations she has for me that she doesn\u2019t even seem to apply to herself. I initially said I needed some distance from her, but her response was even worse than I imagined possible and the situation is now irredeemable. Some of my favorite lines were \u201cit is all about me and my family, get that through your f*cking head\u201d and \u201cif you don\u2019t want to be my doormat, don\u2019t let the door hit you on the way out.\u201d As well as letting me know what other people say about me behind my back and that I was meant to be Hailey\u2019s godmother but she couldn\u2019t bring herself to ask me because of what an absent friend I am. She has been blocked. I\u2019m devastated and relieved, and know I\u2019m not totally blameless for remaining silent and letting resentment build for so long. Thank you Reddit!",

        "selftext": "Context: I am about to be 30, only child with my mom and dad. But my mom\u2019s been invasive. I had journals I\u2019d draw or write down my feelings in when I was in my teens and she used to hate how I cleaned my room so she would kick me out to clean it for me and read/question them. I got rebellious and left at 18. They probably hated me for it for about 3 months and then 2 years later after living in my new state, convinced me to move back home with them. Mistake in my opinion. Fast forward. My bf and I met in my home state but he moved to go to his home state. He never got to meet my parents but also telling my parents about any partner I had was always like walking on eggshells. (My mom said my ex looked gay all bc he had long hair\u2026) and probably a little over 6 months into my lease almost being up with my coworker, me and him planned to live together and I wanted to go to his home state.I debated either telling my parents and be honest so it wasn\u2019t a repeat when I was 18 OR do what I did at 18. My dad bought a home in another state and was planning to retire in it, we argued bc they wanted me to stay so I could hold onto the house in my home state so my mom and dad could be at the new house and then come back in winter. I didn\u2019t wan to stay, so I told them not interested. Mom got upset, dad said \u201cwhelp\u201d and sold my childhood home. Forcing my mom to move with him. When I told them 6months into my plan, my mom was upset. Saying it\u2019s stupid, didn\u2019t make sense, soon my mom warned up to it. Dad\u2026 didn\u2019t.  When I left, I was so happy seeing my bf again after being long distance I forgot to text my dad the address of his apartment, prompting a text from my dad saying \u201cimmature, self centered and selfish.\u201dSince me leaving, my mom\u2019s been a mess. Resorted again to drinking. But she\u2019s a verbal drunk\u2026she called me over and over while I was working. When I texted her I was working and if things were ok, she went CRAZY. Saying I was a shitty daughter, didn\u2019t understand where she \u201cfucked up\u201d with me. Im a piece of shit, wish she never had me, called meloser, failure, saying she would block me, remove me from her life if I wanted nothing to do with her or my dad (which for months I texted and tried to call but the signal there isn\u2019t great bc the house is in the woods) and she just kept going. Blaming me for not taking my childhood home and said if she would have know I was going to be the way I was she would have aborted me. We argued until I said enough. That wasn\u2019t the first time she\u2019d tell me these things. She sobered down and the next day said \u201csorry\u201d but she feels the way she feels still with what she told me. I didn\u2019t answer. Few weeks later asked me for forgiveness. To which I said yes. She\u2019s my mom. Now she wants to talk. I text every now and then but when she asks about me I don\u2019t have much to say, all I do is work. Hang out. Eat out/cook with my bf and that\u2019s it. My dad doesn\u2019t talk to me.

I used to be 220, but I am making improvements to my lifestyle and working on my health so I have lost some weight (and plan to loose more since I am still technically obese.) I was talking with my friends about various topics, as one does, and somehow the topic of body size came up. I opened up to my friends about how I was insecure about the size of my body, and that it made basic tasks like shopping for clothes and doing exercise more challenging, and I told them that I was trying to improve upon myself. However, my friends said that talking about my body size was making them uncomfortable and that we should move on to a different topic, and that it was inconsiderate to talk about private details during casual conversations. I thought that that claim was ridiculous because the size of my body is not exactly... a secret. Still, I stopped talking about it, but I don't thinking that me talking about my body was an inconsiderate thing to do because we were on that topic, and my friends (who are slimmer than me) had also complained about their bodies, so I thought we were bonding over sharing our struggles and insecurities. (As friends do). I know people have their boundaries, but was I really being inconsiderate by opening up about the struggles that I face in my body size?  Edit: Some people were wondering about the context. It was a get-together with me and 3 other friends at one of the friend's house. We have known each other for 4 years (we met in college) and I would say we are pretty close. My friends started the conversation about bodies and insecurities and were talking about how they felt insecure about things like hip dips, cellulite, etc. and how they felt like they couldn't always find clothes that fit them well, so I thought my input was appropriate at the time.",

        "selftext": "TW: Emotional and verbal abuse I adore my soon-to-be sister-in-law and have always had a good relationship with her. At one point, we were extremely close, talking almost daily. My fianc\u00e9 and his brother (her fianc\u00e9) come from a lot of family trauma, and while their relationship is complicated, the four of us have tried hard to maintain a positive dynamic despite personality differences. Over the past year, there was a huge family fall out, and a lot of family drama unfolded, and while my fianc\u00e9 and I tried to stay neutral and support everyone, it became difficult to stay close to them. We fundamentally disagreed with their approach to conflict, which often felt disrespectful, dishonest, and inconsiderate of others' feelings, including ours. They would repeatedly drag us into their drama, pressure us to choose sides, and put us in uncomfortable positions. While we describe them as good people who make bad decisions, it has been exhausting. Despite this, I pushed for us to stay on good terms because we\u2019re family and surprisingly, my individual relationship with my sister in law always remained positive for the most part. However, a few months ago, they started acting distant\u2014canceling plans, being short with us, and generally avoiding us. When I confronted my sister-in-law, she initially lied and said everything was fine (a pattern of theirs). Later, she admitted that her fianc\u00e9 (my fianc\u00e9's brother) has been verbally abusive, to the point where she\u2019s gone to her parents\u2019 house for extended amounts of time, started antidepressants, and is struggling with her mental health. This didn\u2019t shock us, as they argue constantly, even in front of us, but portray a perfect relationship online. I supported her, told her I\u2019m here for her as an individual, and even supported her to leave him if that\u2019s what she needed, while validating all of her feelings. We also spoke to my brother-in-law, who shared that she\u2019s toxic toward him too and has refused therapy because she insists she does no wrong. While his behavior is inexcusable, it\u2019s clear they are both deeply unhealthy for each other. Months have passed, and nothing has improved. They continue to fight, including at our home, where we\u2019ve had to intervene. It\u2019s draining, and while I feel sad for them, it\u2019s hard to stay close when we don\u2019t support their decision to get married. Still, we want to support them as individuals. Here\u2019s the dilemma: my sister-in-law asked me to be in her bridal party, and her MOH has planned an expensive bachelorette trip that will cost me around $3,000. I love her and want to support her, but the idea of celebrating a relationship I feel is so toxic is uncomfortable. On top of that, the cost would put me in a tough financial spot, especially since my fianc\u00e9 and I are planning and paying for our own wedding. My fianc\u00e9 thinks I should politely decline, but I worry about hurting her feelings, especially since we\u2019re the only ones who know what\u2019s really going on behind closed doors. What should I do?",

I consistently tell him I need him but instead he decides to go hang out with friends or that I\u2019m really not that important enough to drop what he\u2019s doing to come see me. I on the other hand have stayed at his apartment until 1 in the morning in excruciating pain (I had a bunch of viruses and vaccines flowing through myself) trying to comfort him when his uncle died. The next day my uncle got admitted to the ER, so TRYING to be considerate I didn\u2019t inform him until later that day. I then told him what was going onrelatively, not all the details. After this happened the next day my uncle was diagnosed with bladder cancer and I was told that he was going to ultimately was going to die. I talked to my boyfriend about it and he just replied \u201cOk\u201d. I am really hurt and confused, not sure how to go about it. Am I the asshole?",

She refused to share details, insisting I believe her without question. Since Violett and I have been close friends for years, and I\u2019ve never known her to speak that way, I confronted her. She was shocked and had no idea what I was talking about, and I believe her. I also found it unfair of Margaret to claim Violett was saying things about me as well, but will not tell me that info either. If she is such a great friend wouldn\u2019t she want us to know what Violett has allegedly been spreading about everyone? Again- she hasn\u2019t even told me what was said about her or anyone in the friend group. She will not tell me any information.  Looking deeper, I realized Violett\u2019s vengeful ex\u2014who has lied about her before(even tried getting her fired from her job, but his claims have been proven false)\u2014is now trying to befriend some people in Violetts life. It seemed too coincidental that Margret suddenly heard something terrible about Violett but wouldn\u2019t reveal the source. I told Margret I couldn\u2019t fairly judge the situation without hearing both sides, but she got angry, refused to discuss it, and won\u2019t speak to Violett. She told me if we remain friends, I am no longer allowed to bring it up again.  Violett reached out to her saying she would like to have a convo and clear the air because her and Margaret had a very close friendship, but Margaret won\u2019t even respond to her texts. I don\u2019t think it is fair of her to not even give Violett a conversation because of the close bond they had prior to this occurrence. Margaret is not telling me to choose sides, or to not be friends with Violett, but I am also questioning Margaret\u2019s loyalty to me if whatever Violett is saying is so vile that she can\u2019t be in the same room with her and she is okay with me staying friends with that person.  Am I wrong for questioning these claims instead of blindly taking Margret\u2019s side? EDIT- Margaret is not sleeping with the ex I can 100% confirm she would not have any interest in him whatsoever but I will not get into that. ",

She would sleep on the floor or an air mattress at her moms house, which I thought was kind of sad. My boyfriend atm, said he would buy her one but we were both short on money (Teens moving into a new apartment yk) so I figured he could buy her one some other time and she could just use mine.  Well\u2026 we\u2019re approaching the end of our lease. My boyfriend is now my ex boyfriend and I need my bed.  Turns out his sister let her cats pee all over my bed, she got red juice all over the mattress, and the plastic I had over the mattress well she apparently took that off, along with the mattress cover. The bed is ruined, my ex said it, she said it, her mom said.  She said that she would buy me a new one. Turns out she meant a cheap $100 mattress from Walmart. Mind you I got mine from Levin and it\u2019s a Sealy mattress- think 500+ I know I should have considered a bit more when I let her borrow it, but at the moment it worked out for both of us, and who would assume a 18/19 can\u2019t take care of a bed when I did it myself??  She said, \u201cI\u2019m ngl Ik I did mess up the bed and i should\u2019ve taken better care of it but I\u2019m not spending 500 on a bed when there are better beds you can get for way less.\u201d  Her words^ so\u2026 AITA for expecting her to replace the mattress she ruined?!

The main ones that are important in this story are Tachycardia and chronic pain: I wear a hip brace and sometimes a knee brace for, but I'm trying to get a cane (the pain isn't only in those spots, it's basically all my joints and bones, but that's all my dad will let me get things for(will get into later)). I also have a lot of mental issues which are all diagnosed and I take medicine for. Alright, onto the main story. Due to my health issues, I've been trying to convince my dad to let me go to the doctors' to get checked out + I want to go so I can help prove to insurance that I need a cane (which multiple people in the health field have recommended), but my dad won't listen to me about that. He won't even let me get wrist braces. Because of the pain, I complain a lot about how my body hurts, and my dad tells me If you're so used to it, then it's not a big deal and stuff like that. We've gotten into arguments about this multiple times but I've mainly given up trying to convince him. But then came today; I had a really important meeting with a psychiatrist today which could effect the rest of my life. I had been stressing about it since last week since it's my second meeting with them. I was going to get picked up at around 1, but my dad texted me. He told me(summarized) Hey, I have to cancel the meeting until they have an opening because my heart is feeling really bad right now. Plus my head hurts badly and I might have to go the doctors' later.When he sent this, I became furious because he described his symptoms, it was the exact same things I've been dealing with since I was 11, and he's always tried downplaying it.Here's where I may be the A-hole. Instead of telling my dad Oh! I hope you feel better or something, I told him Have you taken an advil plus drank water? Or have you rested enough? Ir's probably just acid-reflux and then You should be fine after you take medicine and water. He told me that he still felt bad and that I should be more considerate.I feel bad because when he picked me up at the normal time to head home instead of early for the meeting, he sounded really in pain and tired: and I had been really rude over text. But at the same time, I feel pretty satisfied that he got mad at me for downplaying his symptoms and acting like it was an everyday thing to feel bad (which it is for me) the same way he did to me. I don't know, it's a weird situation. Any perspectives are welcome and I'm fine if I was in the wrong, I just can't tell right now.",

Mainly my sister who is an extreme alcoholic and has been since she was a teenager. My mother berated me and told me its rude and i shouldn't be excluding certain people. I made the comment then maybe we will have a dry wedding instead and that upset her as well but ultimately said it's your wedding do what you want. It wasnt what she said it was how she said it. With her attitude I'm considering not inviting her at all. She always makes a spectacle of herself and is overbearing.

A few months ago, my mother asked me for a few hundred dollars to go on a trip, promising to give me back an extra $25 for every $100 I lent her. I gave her $400, so she was supposed to pay me back $500. Before she had the chance to repay me, my sister asked to borrow money. Since I was low on cash at the time, I told her she could ask our mother for some of the money she owed me. My sister ended up taking $100, but she never paid me back. Fast forward a few months, and she went to the casino and lost all her money. She called me, asking if I could lend her some. I didn\u2019t know at the time that she had blown it all gambling, but I was already annoyed because she hadn\u2019t repaid me from before. Still, since she has kids, I relented and offered her $100. Her immediate response was, *That's all?* I had already been left unpaid once, and I wasn\u2019t willing to give her more, so I confirmed that $100 was all I was offering. She took it and promised to pay me back on Monday. Three days later, on Monday, I asked her if she was going to pay me back. Instead of answering, she just said, *Why?* I asked again, and she repeated, *Why?* I reminded her that she had promised to pay me back Monday, but she flat-out denied ever saying that. Maybe I misheard her over the phone, but considering she had just bought three subs for $40, I pressed again, asking when she planned to repay me. At that point, she got angry, snapped, *I'm not dealing with this,* stormed out of the room, grabbed the money I had given her, and shoved it back into my hands.",

I only found out who he was when I was 13 and even then he did not want custody of me forcing me to stay in the foster system until I was 18. Over my whole life I have had about 5 conversations with him give or take- he is like a stranger to me. He appears once in a blue moon to ask for money or something along those lines. It doesn't really bother me anymore, I've just learnt to accept it now but i don't like talking about it so to avoid that conversation with people i usually just say both my parents are dead. This leads me to a year and a half ago when I had just started dating my boyfriend (25M) and like usual I had just told him my parents were dead but the other day my dad showed up at my door (I still don't know how he knows where I live) and asked for 100 dollars except my boyfriend was there and he obviously found out my dad was not dead. This lead to a long conversation with him that night where I explained the whole situation. He said this was a breach of trust between us since I lied about my dad and that he needed some space to rethink our relationship but he doesn't think he will leave me. I feel so shitty and that I should have told him earlier but I am going to be honest I just didn't think. So AITA? UPDATE: my boyfriend texted me 5 mins ago asking to talk so we are going to have a full in depth conversation tomorrow after work and I'll update again then :)   UPDATE 2 (last update): Before I get to the update I would like clear things up. 1. I have only given money to my dad once when I was still desperate for his love and acceptance but he did not get any money this time. 2. Despite his confusion my bf stepped in to defend me and get my dad to leave and it was only after my dad left he asked me about it Now onto the update. My boyfriend told me that all the sudden information along with the knowledge I hadn't told him the truth was very overwhelming and he just needed some space to not say the wrong thing. He also said that he got why I lied initially and he wasn't mad that I lied more hurt that I felt like I couldn't tell him about it. He also mentioned that he couldn't be there for me if he didn't know what was going on. The conversation ended in tears and it is the most vulnerable I have been in front of someone. He was very understanding and we have decided to draw a line in the sand and 'start again' if that makes sense. I have also looked into therapy for my childhood trauma and all in all I am using this as an opportunity to better myself and heal fully. Thank you for all your kind comments :)",

My friend who I will call M1 then asked her age and I told him, his reaction was to scoff and say 'wow she's old!' And bear in mind that I am NOT close enough with this person for him to be making jokes like that and personally I think it's blanatanly rude for someone's first reaction to you telling them your MUMS age to be and exclamation of how rude she is! So I was like 'okay...that was a bit rude' and then the rest of my friends proceeded to jump on how I'm saying that being old is a bad thing and how I'm saying again isn't beautiful, none of which I think, aging is a beautiful and lucky thing to be able to experience BUT to call a woman  'old'- yes she's past Middle Ag but I would not say she's old? Old is 65-70+ personally- espeiaclly when that woman is my mum,of course it's rude! In my head, if he were to meet my mum and say that too her face, he wouldn't, because it's rude! It was then bought up again that next day and I again insisted Thata it's rude and also that my mum is not old.  A couple of days later I found out that, after they all jumped down my throat aggressively telling me how I'm ageist and that I'm being rude not them, M1 (the one who started this all)had said to my friend F1 that he would stop jokingly make fun of F1 if she were to agree with him that my mum is old. This means that even though they KNOW it's annoying me they still had this little agreement together KNOWING it will wind me up, to then get annoyed telling me I'm starting a fight (I didn't raise my voice or get angry,just defended my mum). Is it just me or is it like they are winding me up on purpose and NOT in a friendly way? Please let me know if you also agree that this is rude!!",

My Dad is trying to start a business I really didn't want to be apart of be abuse of past failed business ventures as well as in my opinion my Dad's poor work ethic as it concerns businesses he starts.  Start of issue: Anyway I went to see a client one day and I did my role like I was supposed to however there was one more thing that was supposed to be on the contract (it wasn't there) but needed to be noted. As well a piece involving a certain amount of money on the contract. That aspect is not my job. My father while not the best with work he knows how to take care of his clients aka making things easy for them. My brother on the other hand is very much, the client can fill that out. Well my father tried to speak with my brother and he was being very rude by just walking away. This is not new behavior he's been like this for years. Things escalated to the point of my father and brother yelling at each other, my mother starting to yell stop, and me coming out my room and yelling stop. In which my brother then tried to verbally attack me and I ended it with me calling him a b*tch.  This definitely wasn't my best moment and moments like this, and some in the past is why I didn't want to work with my family in the first place.  Anyway to my posed question... I apologized an in doing so I pointed out the differences in how my brother was raised versus me. My grandmother had a very big influence in my life. My Mom had cancer when I was 2 so my grandmother was there for a vast majority of my childhood to help out. As well as me being raised with different values than my brother. Either way now my mother and brother are upset with me because of what I stated which mind you has been said to me from my mother, it's been stated by my father, so this is not a family secret. I told him I'm going to just mind my business when they're arguing because the things they argue with him about inadvertently they raised him to have those values. I.e. a relationship with God but as a child pulling him from church on Sundays for games and birthday parties. Or how he speaks to my parents but his friends also spoke that way to their parents and they never redirected him to a different friend group. Certain things like that we were raised completely opposite.  Either way my brother isn't talking to me still and my Mom while she I'd talking to me I feel like it was very corny of my brother to share what I said to him with our parents. Anyway am I the A.H.? More detail, I'm (30F) and my brother is (24M). FYI I wanted to share images of the text messages but couldn't. Sorry guys.",

I was telling this to my stepmom (30 and used to be in band through senior year) and she started saying that I'm just wasting my dad's money and her time. She compared me to her two brothers who gave up in their high school years and how they're failures now, saying I'm going down the same path. Guilt tripping me. I started crying so her excuse was that she's never raised girls and how awful her life was when she was my age (I'm 14, 15 in two months). I told my real mom everything, since she's still very in my life (I'm just living with my stepmom and dad for the time being) and she told my dad everything, who thought it was unacceptable too. Even though, I still feel so bad because I suppose I am wasting time and money they put into just for one year.  I don't want things toeescalate and for my stepmom to think I hate her for telling my real mom everything. Am I the asshole wanting to quite band my first year?  Update:So, for people wondering, our school doesn't let you quit band mid year. You have to go through the whole year after starting. I live in a small town in the South. Everything was handled, but it's really bad being in a southern high school band. I'm not gonna be continuing, but I will keep playing with myself because I enjoy playing. Just not the band part. ",

Now my father is scheduled to have eye surgery and he needs money. They've come knocking on my door. I told them I will give them the money if they called up all the people they 'lent' money to and recovered at least half of what they gave away. They called me an AH and said I was going to hell. (They gave away my college fund to some guy who wanted to go work in Denmark and I had to work 2 jobs to put myself through college and now I work in like one of the top 4 car companies in the country (no thanks to them) so excuse me for being annoyed) TL DR: parents want my money after they practically threw away theirs",

        "selftext": "I (28M) am from the Philippines and have been in a bit of a financial bind recently, trying to manage our family\u2019s finances as best I can. My wife (28F) and I have two kids\u2014a 7-year-old son and a daughter who will be turning 1 soon. I\u2019m the only one working, and I earn about $850 a month. After paying bills and groceries, money is tight. In January, I received a total of $828. I paid $234 in bills in total and gave my wife $144 to budget for the first two weeks. The rest, I kept as savings for our daughter\u2019s birthday, with the plan to add more in the upcoming paychecks. Unfortunately, we didn\u2019t manage the $144 well, and by the next paycheck, we were down to $54 in savings. On January 10th, I noticed my wife only had $28 left, and by the 12th, she was down to just $5. When I asked how that happened, she got upset but said not to worry because it was all spent on us. At this point, I had to dip into the savings I set aside for our daughter\u2019s birthday to cover expenses. Fast forward to later in the month, and I decided to take control of the finances for the next paycheck. I told my wife I would be handling the money for the next two paychecks so I could keep track of everything. I told her she could still take money from my wallet, but she would have to let me know how much and what it was for. She got upset, saying I don\u2019t trust her and that I was being selfish. A few days later, I discovered she was planning to pawn her necklace to help her sister pay off her debt. I tried to open up a conversation by asking about her sister\u2019s situation, hoping she would tell me about the necklace. Eventually, I directly asked if she planned to pawn it to help her sister, and she admitted it. I told her I was against it because we were already in a tough spot financially, and we needed the necklace for our daughter\u2019s birthday. That led to an argument, and she said she\u2019d rather not celebrate our daughter\u2019s birthday than not help her sister. I tried to explain that it\u2019s okay to help others, but it can\u2019t come at the cost of our own financial stability. She became really angry and said she wasn\u2019t willing to understand or give me a chance to explain. She accused me of not trusting her and being selfish, and we\u2019ve been at odds since then. On top of all this, she\u2019s been acting childish in this situation. She insists on not touching our shared money, which we are supposed to spend as part of our budget, but then complains about having it difficult. When I called her out on this behavior, I made it very clear that she needs to grow up and be more responsible. I\u2019ve been feeling hurt because I feel like I made my plans clear and that I\u2019m just trying to keep us financially stable. AITA for being strict about managing our money and not allowing my wife to pawn the necklace to help her sister?",

        "selftext": "I (21M) moved out at 18 for work and college. My family always praised how independent and happy I became. Two years ago, I started dating a high school friend (we\u2019re both men), and a year later, he moved in. I hid our relationship because my family is from a small conservative town and has outdated views\u2014my dad thinks LGBT+ people \u201cjust do it for attention.\u201d Last weekend, I finally told them. I started by explaining I\u2019m *aroace*, which is why I never introduced anyone before. They said they didn\u2019t want me to be alone and should give more people a chance. Then I revealed I\u2019ve had a boyfriend for two years. The irony? The type of relationship they always described as perfect for me is exactly the one I have. Their reaction was awful. My dad prayed at the table and went silent. My mom cried in her room, saying I ruined her dream of grandkids (even though I told them years ago I don\u2019t want kids). When I got home, she texted: *Your dad is really upset and won\u2019t accept this. Please give us time. You\u2019re always welcome at home, but [my boyfriend] coming wouldn\u2019t be good. I love you, even if it\u2019s not what I expected, and I just ask you to respect us too.* I just replied *Ok, I understand.* But I don\u2019t know if I do. I feel like my happiness is something they need to digest. Now, I\u2019m considering not visiting them or allowing them in my home until they accept my boyfriend. It seems fair\u2014if my relationship isn\u2019t accepted in their house, then they shouldn\u2019t be welcome in mine until they respect it. But part of me feels guilty, like I might be \u201casking too much\u201d from people with such a closed mindset. The immediate issue: tomorrow, they\u2019re delivering a fridge (a gift from last year) while my boyfriend and I are at work. I\u2019ve tried hiring delivery before, but it\u2019s hard to carry a fridge up three flights of stairs. I suspect they\u2019ll wait for us to get home, and I *don\u2019t* want to see them. After everything, I don\u2019t want to pretend things are normal. AITA for refusing to see them and cutting contact until they accept my boyfriend? EDIT RESPONSE TO COMMENTS: I\u2019ve seen a lot of responses in a short time\u2014thank you to everyone who took the time to reply. I wanted to add some missing details and context that I left out in the original post. * **English is not my first language**, so I didn\u2019t realize that cutting off sounds extreme. That\u2019s not what I meant\u2014I don\u2019t plan to completely cut them out of my life, just to stop visiting them or having them over until they accept my boyfriend (we live two hours apart).* As I mentioned, my boyfriend was my **high school friend**, and my dad never liked him, even before we were dating. He used to call him the Brazilian equivalent of *faggot* behind his back and got angry whenever I mentioned his name. I lost a lot of friendships because of my family's homophobia, but this was the first one I refused to let go of just because my dad disapproved.* The reason I decided to tell them **after two years** is that they kept giving me positive feedback about my emotional well-being and quality of life. So I thought, *if they\u2019ve been so happy with my changes since I\u2019ve been with him, why would they see him as a bad influence?** One of the worst things my mom said to me privately was: *I never thought about having another child, but after what you told me, I reconsidered.* That really hurt me.* I **do believe they can change** (especially my mom), but I know it will be difficult. They\u2019ve always struggled to understand even basic things about me, like the fact that I\u2019m **introverted and autistic** with sensory sensitivities. Ever since I was a kid, they would drag me to loud parties, and when I got overwhelmed or didn\u2019t enjoy them, they blamed me for not trying to have fun. Even after I got my **autism diagnosis** as an adult, my dad still refuses to acknowledge it.* Since I moved out, I **pay for my own college, rent, and transportation** without any family support (aside from occasional gifts that I never ask for).* About the **fridge**, it was a **Christmas gift** they bought for me, but the Brazilian postal service kept saying they would deliver it and never did. I even took time off work to be home, only for them to never show up. Eventually, my mom got a refund and bought another one closer to her house (two hours away). They had already planned to deliver it before I even brought up this issue. I feel like **I should take it so they can\u2019t use it as leverage against me.*** They have **a spare key to my place**, which was never an issue before (my mistake in hindsight). I\u2019m now considering staying home tomorrow to receive the fridge myself and **take my key back.** Again, thanks for all the insights and perspectives\u2014I really appreciate it.",

(After I had committed to spending the night).  Sure enough, an hour later we are mid-conversation when a roach starts crawling on me! It was so disgusting.  Then I see another one crawling on the wall. I\u2019m very uncomfortable at this point. She acted nonchalant and said it\u2019s just part of apartment living, and that they\u2019re just bugs.  I didn\u2019t sleep well. I was terrified of them crawling on me in my sleep.  The fact that she doesn\u2019t see them as a problem is also concerning to me. She\u2019s just accepted them and isn\u2019t doing anything to combat them, which tells me the problem will just get worse. I don\u2019t want to bring any home with me and honestly it was just an uncomfortable visit.  Am I over reacting? I keep having bad dreams of them crawling all over me at night. WIBTA if I never go over there again? I value her friendship it\u2019s just the pests that make me so uncomfortable! Or am I overreacting?",

        "selftext": "Writing the title makes me feel like I'm the asshole no matter what. But it's not exactly about the clothing. Let me describe my situation first. I (34M) met my wife (36F) 4 years ago. We got ~~engaged~~ married after 1 year together. We have a 2-year-old daughter. We\u2019re both working freelance, and her income is usually two or three times more than mine. We work equally in terms of time spent. When one person is working, the other takes care of the baby. As she earns more, she spends more. She treats herself and the family members (1 child and 2 cats) at her level of income. For example, we dine out a bit too much (I try to cook, not bad, but she usually doesn\u2019t feel like eating at home). She loves to buy expensive fruit over the affordable ones, or buy costly clothing, bags, or a top-of-the-line rice cooker. At the same time, she wants to feel equal in providing for the family. I try my best (I always sleep later and wake up earlier) to meet her expectations (and maybe haven't met them yet?), so I always run out of money every month. Every time I bring this into conversation, it\u2019s always \u201cI have the right to use my money.\u201d There's no way to get her to spend at the same rate as my income (which is above average in my city). -------- She used to work in the fashion industry, so she\u2019s a bit picky about what she wears. I never thought about sitting down with her to write down every item on her wishlist. Because what she can buy, she already buys; and what she can\u2019t buy, I can\u2019t help her with. At least, that\u2019s what I think. So, today, she bought a Chanel lipstick (first time after 3 years) and I (intended to say let me pay) asked for the price, and she replied $50. I said, \u201cWow, a $50 lipstick? Normal people can never use this.\u201d I can\u2019t afford it at the moment, so I didn\u2019t suggest paying for her either. She felt disappointed because of what I said, and because I never buy her any significant things except on birthdays (her last birthday\u2019s gift was a small necklace worth 1/5 of my monthly income) and some special occasions in the 4 years we've been living together. Apart from occasional flowers, I rarely buy her any significant gifts in daily life because I never save enough for this. I mean, it\u2019s not my priority to buy her excessive stuff that she doesn\u2019t really need. So, AITA for not putting my wife's girly stuff more on top of my priority? ----  **EDIT:** As everybody mention about the 50$ lipstick, I must say it's not a big deal for something you will use in 3 years. I just not prepare for that (I thought around 20$ to 30$), so it shock me and I say it out so unthoughtfully. Yep, so her point is not about this lipstick but the fact that I rarely buy her nice stuffs apart from special events. As I can see, my reason as not saving enough for this kind of stuffs is weak and kind of the excuses. On the other hand, we should have more conversation on how the expense is splitted. **EDIT2:** I read all of your comments and feel very thankful. Since this is the first time I tell my story in Reddit and I don't know what to expect. I just try to put on a short version of the situation for not wasting your time. Apparently, it lacks of some information and clarification. I want to answers some FAQ below and give my conclusion. **1. Is she usually have gifts for me? What are those?**  She gifted me many shirts (5 to 7) and pants (~3) in the first year we met, not so after that. She gift me 3 birthday presents - a coat, a helmet, and a phone (a decent 2nd-hand phone I choose to replace my broken one). I don't really remember anything else recently. Now looking back, I can tell how she's obsessed with fashion and want to put nice clothes on me. I feel thankful, for sure, but you see, those things are practically good, but too boring.  My birthdays gift for her is an Instax Camera, a wooden music box with horses cart riding the marrying couple (which turn out to be our's daughter favorite toy...), and a necklace (her choice). I tried to be creative. **2. Do I know that what she want is only a tangible gift to show her my love?** Yes, I know. She told this directly to me. In my defend, I want to shout out that my financial strain caused by following her lifestyle so I could hardly budget anything even for myself (I'm not doing that, I'm writing here to ask for your help instead). I bought her flowers once every two months. I bought snacks and small gifts (funny key chains, etc) occasionally. But those things is too easy to buy so maybe she dismissed it. **3. Do we have joint account? Do we really pay 50/50?** We used to have a joint account (and we put 50/50 into it), somehow it's complicated to handle it so we dismiss it after 2 or 3 months of marriage and spend on our own. Yes, we target for 50/50 on essential things. The renting, the kids (daughter and cats) expense, the market's foods and dine out meal, health care, daily stuffs,.... It's vary depend on every months. But I could say she paying more in general. It could be something between 55/45 to 60/40.  Even I pay less, my money is running out frequently. (For example, she pay 1000$ and I pay 800$). She still have a big deal of money to spend on clothes and sandals and accessories for her and our daughter (more than what their need), expensive fruits and snacks, milk tea,... After that, she still remains some for saving. **4. Does she a materialistic person?** No, I don't think so. I think it's because our love language is un-align.  For example, I touch her and say I love her a lot, but she doesn't enjoy doing that. She usually said it's not the words matter, the actions (gifts?) matter. I spend time with her, listen to her more than enough, and she think that's just obvious couple's obligations. Maybe I should know better about her love language. **5. My conclusion** As many of you pointed out, the question is why I'm still staying here, in the financial strain situation.  I must have a real talk with her (or us with counselor) to set up an equitable expense, not equally expense. Following that, we should have a joint account. I should also budget for some gifts, which is her go-to love language. Thank you very much for supporting me. I can't see how I get through this without your words. I hope I can give you a best UPDATE as I can.",

We've had a disagreement years ago regarding my mental condition (where I'm from having a mental condition is still frowned upon by older people, so when it was confirmed, my mom couldn't accept that I was deficient; I think she got over it already, but we didn't talk about it -- or anything meaningful, for that matter).  I'm not not talking to her as in a silent treatment thing. I'm just... she's *loud*, and we've never been close to begin with, and the older I get the more detached I become (that's part of my mental thing). I live not another city level of far away, but far enough that we can't meet by coincidence (every time we need to meet even briefly it has to be organised). When she needs help, I'm here (which is not often because most of these cases are handled by my little sister (32F) who's probably the most sane and responsible adult in our little family, and sis lives with her). The thing is, I've probably talked to her like 3 times in the past year, once for her birthday and then for needing help thing my sis couldn't handle. We don't exchange messages. It is the way I prefer things, but I'm wondering if I've been hurting her. Sis seems okay, she calls me like once a month (I wonder if she has it scheduled lol). She wasn't a bad mother. I can't blame her for failing to notice/adress my mental condition (it was aparent since my childhood, but it wasn't just my mother, there were qualified teachers and psychologists at school who thought that my weirdness was totally okay because I've got good grades), I just... I don't have enough emotions and expressions to be a normal person instead of a brick wall, and her emotions are so overboard to me (sis sometimes gets tired too) that I can't really be okay for more than two days in the same house. To be fair, I can get tired of pretty much anyone in the same space with me, like sis would visit for work matters, stays couple of weeks and I'm celebrating when she goes back. So. I am comfortable with barely holding any contact, because that's how I feel (or rather don't feel). Am I the asshole towards my more normal human-to-human interaction-oriented family?",

        "selftext": "PSA: English isn\u2019t my first language, so please be kind. I (26F) have been married to my husband (32M) for almost a year now, and we\u2019ve been together for five years. We come from different countries and cultures. We met in 2020 in my hometown while he was there for work and got stuck due to COVID. At the time, I was doing my MBA. By the time I graduated and started job hunting, it was time for him to go back. He wasn\u2019t sure when or if he\u2019d return, and neither of us wanted to do long distance, so we decided I wouldn\u2019t take a job and would go with him instead. I started working in his business and received a salary. We traveled a lot for work and were together 24/7. In 2022, he and his business partners sold that business and made good money. My husband already owned some property, and after selling the business, he bought more and made various investments. He works a lot\u2014he\u2019s a professor, a business owner, a trader, and much more. Over time, I started helping him with almost everything. I didn\u2019t get a salary, but he always told me, \u201cMy money is your money,\u201d and I never had to ask for anything. I always had more than enough, and he even helps my family. Still, it sometimes bothered me that I didn\u2019t personally own anything. In 2023, we got engaged, and in the summer of 2024, we got married. That same year, he bought another business with his friend and my FIL (75M) as partners. The business needed a lot of setup and administration work, but my husband was too busy to handle it. His friend works full-time, so he couldn\u2019t help much, and his father is a silent partner. Naturally, all the work fell on me. For the past 10 months, I\u2019ve been working on this business 24/7 hiring people, managing marketing, setting everything up, solving endless problems, and doing a million other things. I don\u2019t mind not owning anything in the business, we\u2019re married, and what\u2019s his is mine but what does bother me is how my FIL treats me. During meetings, when I present ideas and get everyone up to speed, my husband always acknowledges my work, saying things like, \u201cThanks to OP, we\u2019re able to run this business.\u201d But my FIL constantly downplays my role, acting as if I\u2019m just an employee. He even tries to take credit, saying buying the business was his idea. Last week, he did the same thing. Downplaying  my role and even telling me to take notes, as if I were some intern and not the person leading the meeting. That\u2019s when I started thinking: if my husband expects me to keep working on this business, maybe I should ask for some shares in it. I brought this up to my mom, and she lost it on me. She said, \u201cHe\u2019s your husband, why would you ask him for that? You shouldn\u2019t pay attention to your FIL. What\u2019s his is yours, and you should be thankful because he\u2019s so kind.\u201d In my culture, men are put on a pedestal even when they don\u2019t deserve it, and my husband is amazing, so of course, my mom is biased. I don\u2019t really have friends I can talk to about this, so, internet strangers AITA for asking for shares in his business?",

        "selftext": "So i (15f) have a best friend (also 15f), who got a moped last summer, after turning 15. We had fun summer riding it together and going to places and so on. One day she sends me a message telling me how her dog had peed on her helmet, because she had left it on the floor. She comes to pick me up from my house the same day and complained, how the helmet is ruined, and how it still smells like dog pee even after she had washed it. After she had picked me up, we decided to go to her place. After the whole day of complaining about the helmet, she told me that her parents went to get her a new one. I was a bit shocked, because the helmet did cost a 150$ and they didint really try that hard to get the smell out. Then she told me that she was just gonna throw the old helmet away, so i asked her if i could have it, since my helmet is old and pretty scratched and i tought that i could atleast try to get the smell off of it. She told me that i could have it and !keep in mind that i asked if she wants any money for it and she said no! She even asked her mother if it would be okay and her mom also said yes. I asked her few times if she is 100% sure that she wants to give it to me and that she doesn\u00b4t want any money for it, and she kept saying yes. I was very happy that i finally had a new helmet and when i got home i immediately washed the helmet twice and also left it to my balcony for a week just to get the smell out of it. Finally it worked. I completely got the smell off the helmet. The next day when me and my best friend were hanging out again, i told her that i got the smell out of it. for my suprise she wasn\u00b4t happy for me. Infact she actually asked it back. She said that it is still hers and that she actually wants to sell it now. I was really shocked and i refused to give it back to her, because she had gave it to me. I told her that i could have gave her some money for it, but she didn\u00b4t want it. She just kept on saying that i should give it back, because she wants to sell it and that it is still her helmet and stuff like that. I still refused, because i was the one who got the smell off of it and kept pointing out the fact that she had gave it to me. We have had couple of small arguments about this even after summer and now i really just need someone elses opinion. So please tell me Am i the asshole? P.s Im sorry if there is a lot of mistakes. English is not my first language.   UPDATE:  So thank you to everyone who has told me some good ideas what to do. Today i started talking to my friend about the helmet again. I wanted to see how she reacts and what she woud say, so i just said something like i will buy new glasses to wear with the helmet you gave to me. After saying that she said no i will take it back. We had an argument again and i told her that she literally gave it to me and that im the one who cleaned it. She then said that she could give me like 20$ for it, but that it wasn\u00b4t a gift and that after she had gave it to me her mom had said that she could have sold it. I told her that she had literally given it to me. So it basically was a gift. After this argument we both were kind of giving eachother silent treatment while we were walking back to her house. We had made plans earlier this week that we would go to the gym after school and we had been talking about it even at school. Suddently when we are walking to her house to get her gym clothes, she suddently says im tired so i won\u00b4t come to the gym. I was really pissed because an hour ago she was not too tired to go. I was getting really annoyed so i said fuck you and turned around.  And for everyone saying that if i give it back i should pee in it first, i definetly will. The first thing i will do is just not talk about it and if she mentions it i will just keep telling her no.' If that doesn\u00b4t work i will pee in it or make my dog pee in it and then give it back.  Thank you everyone who has responded to this!! ",

        "selftext": "First of all I love my family very much.Over the years I\u2019ve realized past childhood wounds that I\u2019ve had due to my upbringing and never being taught about boundaries or being unaware of manipulation. Now that I\u2019m older (39 F) I\u2019ve healed those wounds and try to maintain a healthy environment for myself.  My mom\u2019s mother was very manipulative amongst other things and would do and say things to all of us that were messed up. For example, when I was a kid she started calling me Pippa at one point and then told me it was the name of the dog in her romance novel.  Now my mom is starting to do messed up things like that as well to mess with my self esteem, always acknowledging that what she did was something her mom would do to her. When I ask why then is she repeating that behavior and doing it to me, she changes the subject. I\u2019ve asked her before to go to therapy and she says that \u2018she has in the past\u2019. I\u2019ve told her if she doesn\u2019t then it will put a strain on our relationship and I\u2019m ignored.  My dad and I are closer but he always wants things to be happy and chipper, which doesn\u2019t leave room for any other emotions. If upset emotions are expressed then there must be something wrong with you.  I\u2019ve been going through a lot as of late with job issues, a restraining order from an ex, and moving to different state. I told my parents this past year to not expect me to visit this summer and Xmas since I knew money would be very tight. I asked them to respect that and to not ask me non stop if I\u2019ll be visiting. Sure enough they continued to ignore my request continued to ask every time they called (which is about every other week).  I repeated to them to stop asking me and they continue to anyway. They offer to pay for the flight, but since I\u2019m freelance, any day away means that I might not have enough money for rent. For November , my family came out and I cooked a feast for everyone. We all had a great time, even though once again my mother decided to randomly interrupt me asking me if I cut my eyebrows, while I was talking about something serious. She once again said that was something her mom would do to her.  She then asked me again, to which I replied \u201care you really asking me?\u201d And she said no. The rest of my family just sort of ignores these behaviors and my sister gets super clicky with my mom.  After that I was repeatedly asked if I was coming home for the holidays and I reminded them of what I told them earlier in the year. They continued to ignore me and ask up until the week before Xmas. Now that it\u2019s February, my parents have been hounding me non stop to come visit or for me to go visit them. I told them that I\u2019m trying to figure out my life and to give me space and I\u2019m ignored. I tell them they\u2019re adding stress with the constant asking and adding other things on to my plate with my birthday coming up and now I\u2019m sick. AITA?",

        "selftext": "Here me out first before passing judgment. A few months ago, my grandfather turned 80. My brother and I have been living overseas for several years, and this was the first time in a few years that we were both back in town at the same time. As it coincided with our grandfather's birthday, our mother thought it would be great to have a birthday dinner to include my grandfather's children, grandchildren, and great grandchildren as well as their partners and family members, if any.  Since my uncle (grandfather's son) and his wife are usually the busiest, we let them decide the day and time on the one weekend when my brother and I were both in town. They chose Saturday dinner, which everyone then quickly confirmed through a family group chat. This was one month before the party. As the date had been set, I then planned my own time back in town accordingly. Nine days before my grandfather's party when I was back in town, my mother suddenly says that my uncle just messaged the group chat and changed the time to Saturday lunch because it was winter and cold and lunch time would be better for our grandfather. I told her that I was not free for lunch and that I was sure that my brother couldn't make it too, as he had just called me a few days earlier to make sure that our grandfather's party was indeed Saturday dinner. My mother quickly called my uncle to tell him that my brother and I couldn't make it. My uncle then got very angry and immediately said that he would cancel the dinner. 10 minutes later, he sends a message to the group chat saying that (and I quote) that \u201cDue to everyone having prior arrangement on such an important day for grandpa\u2019s birthday and can\u2019t make it to the event, we have decided to cancel the birthday celebration\u201d.  I quickly decided that I would still want to have dinner with my grandfather and confirmed it privately with everyone else, and everyone was fine with it. I then messaged the group chat the next day saying that I was still going ahead with the dinner and anyone who can make it can come and just let me know. I got radio silence from my uncle and his wife.  But AITA for not changing my plans so that the birthday party could be held at lunch? By the way, I thoroughly enjoyed the party and I assume everyone else did too because we didn't need to deal with my uncle and his wife's presence.",

        "selftext": "So this is my 8th pregnancy.. Yes I know it's a lot lol. I have never had a baby shower thrown for me. My mom never cared enough to do one and I don't have friends. I've always wanted to do one so I figured this year I could do one with my kids and my husband. Nothing real formal just maybe a cake and a day at Dave and busters or something like that. My husband was so happy he of course told his coworkers about the pregnancy. They congratulated him and offered said they would love to throw me a baby shower. Apparently they started planning right away and requested I make a registry at Amazon. I honestly didn't feel comfortable with that, I am just grateful for anything I get. They planned for it to be at the office which is a funeral home. That part does bother me a little, what really bothers me are his coworkers. My husband often comes home and complains about the way they treat him and his staff. From our experience the office staff at funeral homes never respect the guys working outside. Anyhow I told my husband that I don't feel comfortable going because I don't actually know them. What I do know about them is what he has told me and they don't seem very nice. He rolled his eyes and was like  who cares, it's a chance to get free stuff. I still didn't feel comfortable but I said I'd go with him. My husband then told me he wasn't going to be there and I immediately said I'm not going. I appreciate that he wanted to do something for me but him not being there was a deal breaker. It's been two weeks and he asked about it and I just asked him to thank them for the thought but if rather do something with just my family. He really wants me to go but I really don't want to. So would I be a jerk for not going? ",

        "selftext": "I know this is gonna sound super petty but let me give you the details first. I (21f) live at home with my mother (52f) and sister (16f) along with my 2 dogs and their new puppy. They got this cocker spaniel back around October, she's about 5 or 6 months now, if I'm correct and with me working at a pet store, I'm pretty knowledgeable about the dos and don'ts when it comes to dogs, not an expert though. But since the puppy has been here, I've tried my best to be assistive while also letting my sister, who is the primary care taker of the dog, take the lead when it came to training, grooming, and the ect. But she can definitely be a bit lazy, as teenagers are, so if the dog needed to be let out to play n use the bathroom after being locked in her play pin all day (because my sister sleeps for hours on end), I do so.  I also let them both come in and use my discount at work for the puppy, which is at cost and get food for free every other month. But recently, she's been getting really short with me, and I'm not a huge fan of the attitude when all I'm trying to do is help. Today it hit a head when I woke up to a call from her saying that her dog along with my dog's were out and about down stairs (the main living space) by themselves, with if I remember correctly, her saying that her dog was still eating and mines were choosing not to. Now mind you, by this time, both of my dogs are in my room as I'm half sleep and the puppy is by herself doing God knows what, and possibly getting into their food which is different due to allergies, so I jump from bed and rush downstairs, apparently hanging up the phone in the process which I didn't mean to do, but not before saying why didn't you just wake me up to say this instead of leaving the house and calling me. I then go downstairs to find the puppy is ok, did containers secure, and 2 full bowls of food put out of reach.  I then got this series of text messages saying I'm lucky she even tries to feed my dogs, calling me dramatic among other things. And I simply tell her I help out with her dog out of kindness and reciprocity, and barley the latter since I've come home with my dog's not fed or takin outside, without so much as a thank you or a kind word my way unless she needs something and that I'm done helping out with her dog and with her attitude, and that whatever she wants done to and with her dog, she can do herself, including arranging for someone to stop at our house to let her dog out or use any products that are meant for my dog's on hers. Also stating she and my mom can now pay full retail  price for anything regarding her dog, which I'm sorry to say I have held that over her head a few times in the past due to her terrible attitude not just towards me but the things I do for her. Am I the a-hole for taking this step to the detriment of this puppy?? Am I being too petty even though this has been happening for what seems like months? ",

A friend of mine (30 m) was also invited, I would like to add that he was already on quite some thin ice, to make it simple I will refer to him as Bob We share 2 mutuals friends (21 f) and (25 m) to make it simple I will refer to them as Lynn, and Jeff. We used to be quite close all three, having Lynn move into my appartment complex made us only closer, unfortunately Bob decided to make a new groupchat purely to not include me. When confronted he denied of the existence, which upset Lynn due to us being really close and just not liking it at all. Despite all this Bob was still invited to my party, because I didn\u2019t want to make this \u201cbigger\u201d then it was. I rented a location for my birthday, which due to the rain became quite muddy outside and had a lot of gaps in the ground, it was also really dark outside He decided without communicating to me, that he would do a photoshoot on that terrain with some people I also invited, I simply asked them why because a birthday party doesn\u2019t seem like the time nor place to do a photoshoot imo. I wouldn\u2019t mind people taking pictures at all, with phones since I understand taking selfies/videos! But he took all his camera equipment with him, including lights without any communication. I as a photographer myself, would never take my equipment with me, at a private event like birthday parties unless the host asked. Or unless I asked for permission and it was fine My boyfriend kindly asked him to stop, because it was just weird to just shoot on a birthday party without any proper notice. Eventually he came back into the party, looking all upset for the last 3 hours, and just keeping looking at his phone which was just very awkward for all the guests being there. When asked about it by others he kept claiming he was getting \u201ckicked out\u201d which mind you he only got kindly asked to stop, due to the terrain being dangerous etc etc Eventually he left without saying goodbye, or honesty anything I kindly messaged him, because stuff like this wouldn\u2019t have happened if there was any communication. He claimed that \u201che was an adult so he didn\u2019t need to ask for permission, and that he was done getting told what he could do and not\u201d He ended up blocking me and Lynn on everything because he was upset, later I however also find out that he was bragging to my guests about going on a date with a 19 year old, so I don\u2019t know whether I dodged a bullet, or whether I am truly in the wrong.",

        "selftext": "The company I work at is made up of two sister companies: Company A and Company B. I work at Company A. I referred my close friend (let\u2019s call them Alex) to jobs at both companies in September. I organised Alex to have a conversation with my supervisor, and they eventually got a job at company B. For this, I got a bonus (circa $1500). As I consider them a close friend, I offered to share the bonus with Alex so we could go on holiday.  In December, another friend (not a close friend, let\u2019s call them Toni) contacted me about a referral. I referred Toni to several jobs across Company A and Company B, organising meetings with colleagues on the teams he wished to join in company A. I told Alex about this and they said that was exciting as they also know Toni - again, not close friends. Over the Christmas Holidays, I mentioned to Alex that I\u2019d love for them to come to a festival with me this year. I had asked a few times in previous years. This time, Alex agreed and asked to borrow the money ($400) from the bonus and they would pay it back. I agreed and Alex bought their ticket.  The next week, Alex said they might camp with another group of friends at the festival. I thought this was a bit of a rubbish thing to do but Alex assured me they would most likely camp with me.  Last week, Toni eventually landed a job in Company B. The same day, I saw Alex and mentioned this and how I had referred Toni to the job. In Toni\u2019s case, I was not going to share the bonus as we are not close and I have a large bill to pay.  Alex mentioned they had also referred Toni to the role and had contacted HR about the bonus but were told that HR would not be paying out. I said that can\u2019t be right and said I would talk to HR the next day, promising Alex that I would split the money with them as we had both referred Toni.  The next day, I spoke to HR and they confirmed that the bonus was already confirmed to be paid out to Alex and Toni had signed the documentation to confirm this.  Having followed the referral process myself, I know that Alex would have had to sign the documentation prior to Toni signing it. That\u2019s when I realised Alex had been dishonest with me. I contacted Alex relaying what HR had said and asked if they would be willing to split the bonus with me as I had offered before. Alex responded saying they wouldn\u2019t expect me to split the bonus had Toni got a job in Company A. I couldn\u2019t believe it.  Following some back and forth, I said I didn\u2019t have to split my bonus with Alex but I did because they are my close friend and I thought it would be nice. I also said that their behaviour was dishonest and selfish. Alex said they would pay me back the $400 and I can keep their half of my bonus.  At this stage, it wasn\u2019t about the money. It was about the dishonesty. I find it hard to stick up for myself at times, but unfortunately this is not the first time Alex has been dishonest. I reiterated my point and Alex denied being dishonest and accused me of calling them names. We have since agreed not to talk for a while.  Have I overreacted?",

Forced by my parents, Emma chose medicine and I chose engineering.

So my study abroad was cut short.But I graduated and secured a job asap. Got married and settled abroad. Never asked for a penny from my parents from the moment I started earning because I didn't want to pressure my father.  Emma was struggling to complete her studies. I think it is at this point she started to develop a deep sense of entitlement and resentment towards my parents and me.She finally manipulated my dad into renting her an apartment in the city so that she can study better.She would often call me to say she hasn't even eaten properly cause she doesn't have money and I'd send her money right away. Recently my family visited me.Emma visited me earlier than my parents. At this time, I was also expecting a baby. Emma acted like me being pregnant was an annoyance cause I couldn't take her around. regardless I even took her to see the city lights at mid night. My husband was concerned for my well-being and was very upset of how I was being treated.Emma would always come home saying she has no money(even though my father gave her money to spend here).she treated me like atm citing that she has done things for me (organising my wedding) so I SHOULD do everything for her and she sacrificed her youth to take care of my parents while I built my life here. After my parents came, I realised that she basically gets anything she wants from dad.I even found out that my father has given her much more money than she told me.I was upset.Even when I'm in pain,Emma very nonchalantly asks so where are we going today. That was it for me because I felt that she is treating my unborn child poorly. So I started ignoring her.I did some petty stuff like refusing to wash her clothes in the washer. Seeing this,Dad said he treated both of us equally which is not true at all because they get fancy gifts for her on her birthday but I haven't even received a card on mine for many years.   I don't think she will ever understand that me building up a life in a different country with zero family support was a sacrifice, because my father wouldn't have had the means to spend on her if he sent me money as well.   Recently I lost my beloved father. He wanted me to take care of my mum and my sister. I did speak to Emma during funeral arrangements, things have turned extremely sour.Emma is handling many of my dad's assets that I don't even know about because she wants everything for her claiming that she was the one who took care of him. So yeah, I do not talk to her and She never reached out too.I feel bad because my dad must be very unhappy. AITA?",

        "selftext": "I (24f) have been friends with a girl that I'll call Hayley (24f) since high school. For a few years we didn't get to see each other much because we went to college on opposite sides of the country, but I moved to her city last year so we really got to catch up with each other.  Hayley will be turning 25 in a week so we - along with some other friends - started planning her birthday party a while ago. She wanted to have a rather big party so that she could invite all of her friends groups, but we couldn't find anywhere to have it and she lives in a small apartment. I on the other hand have a house, it's not that big but it's big enough to host the party. So our friends started bringing it up and said that we could throw the party at my house.  I was fine with that. I did find it kinda weird that they were the one to bring it up, because I personally wouldn't suggest throwing a party in someone else's house unless they were the one to suggest it, but it didn't really matter. So I said yes, my only conditions were that the party didn't turn into chaos, that no one got too drunk, and that they helped me clean up the next day. Everyone was fine with that so we agreed on it.  Yesterday, Hayley sent me a text to tell me how many people would be there. That's when she asked me if I could get my cat out of the house for the night, because one of her friends from college is allergic. I told her that I didn't have anywhere else to leave him, but that I could make sure that he stayed upstairs while we were downstairs. I also told her that my cat is very shy and easily scared so there's no way he'd get close to her friend.  She then told me that I could just leave him with my parents and then go back to get him the next day. My parent's house is about an hour and a half drive and there's just no way I'd drive a total of 6 hours in one weekend. I told her that it really wasn't possible for me to leave him with my parents but that he would be locked upstairs and I'd deep clean the house to make sure there's no cat hair anywhere. I also told her that she should've told me earlier and I could've found another solution, but now the party is in less than a week.   She told me that I wasn't being helpful and that I was ruining her party, and she's been bitching about me to a lot of our mutual friends. I told her that I had no obligation to let her do the party at my house and I kindly accepted to do so, so the least she could do was to be grateful. She hasn't replied since. Most of our friends agree with me, but I also feel a bit guilty. I don't know if I'm in the wrong here and I don't know what else I can do.  ",

He comes over every weekend so my mom and I can care for the baby on Sunday and Monday nights. They leave for work at 3:00 a.m. and leave the baby with me until my mom gets home at 8:00 a.m. Then my mom takes over until they get back from work at 2:00 p.m. My mom works 12-hour night shifts. I do this once or twice a week, depending on my mom's schedule. Mind you, I did not sign up for this. They pretty much said, She's not doing anything anyway, so she can take care of the baby while my mom gets home. I'm currently not working, hence why I'm home and living off savings. I also have had health issues since November. I will be having surgery soon. This is another issue. I clearly told my mom that I did not want people coming in and out of our house because if I get sick, my surgery will be canceled. She does not care, and my brother and his girlfriend were sick last week, coughing and sneezing all over the house. Now, this weekend, the baby has started to get sick. I just texted them that one of them will have to call off work to take care of the baby because what if she gets worse? I know for a fact that they are still going to leave her and my brother is going to get pissed and start with the name calling.  You're a selfish *****, she's your niece. That's the reason things happen to you because you're a ***** and hypochondriac. You're weak minded.When I wanted to go to the ER for my pelvic pain nobody wanted to take me. I had to call my bf. He had to get out of work and come get me. I feel like I'm always helping out my family one way or another, but when I need a favor, it's crickets. ",

She said she bought it for 499\u00a3 (which was an year ago), I said okay.   few days ago she asked me again, if I can buy and give her the money, cause she needs it, I asked her how much she would sell me for, and she said 500\u00a3, and I was taken a back, cause I was thinking may be 250\u00a3, or 300\u00a3, max I can buy for 350.

For context; They weren't all bad, some were and others enabled them, intentionally or not.  I know it would make him happy if I invited my family, but I can't get past what they have done towards me.

        "selftext": "I, 17F, got into an argument with my mom about taking me to work. This happened Friday evening. My whole house is sick, except my mom. All of our symptoms are different yet similar. I have recurring headaches, runny nose, sore throat, and severe body aches. My body aches are so serve that tossing and turning in bed feels like a chore. I can\u2019t sit up or lay down for too long without feeling incredibly sore. No joke it took me like 40 minutes to get dressed for work on Friday. Thursday night my manager asks if I can come in Friday night for a shift. I told her I was sick and didn\u2019t want to spread it but if they really needed me, I\u2019d go in and wear a mask. She said she\u2019d see if she could get someone else and would let me know Friday morning. While I was texting my manager, I told my mom I would only accept the shift if she could take me and pick me up, which she agreed to. Now, in my apartments you have to have a sticker to park in your parking space and the stickers have recently been upgraded, which costs a little money to renew. With all that being said, my mother has been parking on a street until she can renew hers. Long story short, my manager can\u2019t find anyone else and I\u2019m her last option. I agreed and my mother also agrees to take and pick me up from work. As my mother and I both get in the car to take me to work, she starts going on about how she might lose her parking space on the street. I thought this was weird since she knew her parking space would be at risk of being taken if she took me. She just kept going on about how selfish it is to even ASK for a ride to work knowing her current parking situation. Since it was raining pretty hard this day and I already felt like crap, I didn\u2019t even think about getting on the bus. I told my mom that if taking me was such a problem, why\u2019d she even agree in the first place?? We kept going back and forth and I was seriously sitting there thinking: what are we even fighting about? We were fine with each other all day, her attitude literally came out of nowhere. I get to work and ask my mother if she\u2019s still picking me up. She says yes but if my manager can take me home, which they usually do, then that would be even better.  Coincidentally, my manager offered me a ride home a little into my shift. Around this time, my mother had texted me saying she got her spot back. I told her she should apologize for the way she was acting but she didn\u2019t feel I needed an apology, typical. Long story short, I ended up going home early because I started to feelworse. I was incredibly dizzy and felt nauseous. I caught a ride home from a friend. Once I got home, my mom was acting like nothing happened, which was common of her. She never apologizes or really even acknowledges our fights, she just brushes it off until our next one. My family has arguments and fights like this all the time, sometimes worse. We\u2019ve literally had 3 more arguments since this one. Soooo, am I the AITA for asking for a ride to work?",

That hurt more than I can even explain. I told him I needed support, just a simple \u201cI\u2019m here for you\u201d or \u201cYou\u2019re going to be okay.\u201d Instead, he told me I hadn\u2019t achieved anything in life yet, so why would he tell me he\u2019s proud of me?

My ex-boyfriend and I had been dating for six years and living together for 3. l've been unhappy in our relationship for the past few months and finally decided it was time to break up with him. I broke up with him last week, and it's been extremely painful ever since. There have been a lot of tears and conversations, and trying to navigate moving out on top of everything has been hell. For context, I love my ex very much, but I felt breaking up was my only choice if I wanted to be happy as things were not getting better. On to the story! One of my friends had a bridal shower this weekend, and I could not be more excited for her. My ex-boyfriend and I have been good friends with this person and their fianc\u00e9 \u2014 we have even gone on vacations together. My friend is aware of my break-up and has seen first hand how much I have agonized over this decision. When I arrived at her bridal shower yesterday and started greeting other guests, I quickly realized that somehow everyone in the room already knew about my breakup. Throughout the night, I was approached by multiple people, even ones I barely know, who offered their condolences, told me they were proud of me, asked how my apartment search was going, and prompted me for details about my breakup and impending move. The MOH even pushed for details multiple times in front of the bride\u2019s family, even though I was very clearly trying to navigate away from the subject. The whole night felt like one of those scenes in high school when you walk into a room and notice people looking at you as if they've just been whispering about you. I played it off as best I could and tried to change the subject whenever possible. Apart from that, I would say the evening went fine and everyone had a lovely time celebrating the bride. However, since getting home yesterday, I can't help but feel really betrayed. It feels like my friend used my painful breakup as gossip and shared it with a lot of people who shouldn't know my personal business, especially since I'm not close with them in any way. Both my ex and I are real people with real feelings and our pain shouldn\u2019t be used as party gossip. I've also started receiving texts from people who attended the party, informing me that they've heard what happened and asking how I'm doing. While I understand their intentions are positive, this feels very invasive. These are her friends, not mine. I would have understood her sharing this with her partner or even a close mutual friend of ours, but this was much bigger than that. I texted her today and told her I could no longer be her bridesmaid or friend. Both her and the MOH think I overreacted. Now I\u2019m second guessing my decision and worried I was too rash \u2014 I just simply can\u2019t imagine treating a friend this way when they feel so vulnerable. Am I the asshole?",

        "selftext": "I 40 yo female and my husband 41 yo male have a constant battle over the temperature of the house during the winter heating season. I would ideally keep the house 65-70F unless it is super cold outside in which case I might go as high as 72-74F. The higher temp would be a rare exception for me. I do typically like to be cooler overall and wear fewer layers and lighter fabrics. He prefers to be warmer overall but wants to be able to lounge around the house in a t-shirt and sleep shorts when he is in for the evening. He rather adamantly insists that he is the sole controller of the thermostat of which there is only one for the whole house. He says growing up that he never had any choice in the temperature of his home and that as an adult he will always have the choice and control. This means that the thermostat has a locked out range of 72-80F and he typically maintains it at 77-79F and is \u201ccomfortable.\u201d He will occasionally make changes when I tell him how miserably uncomfortable I am at that temperature but his concession is typically only a couple of degrees to perhaps 76F.  He feels that my perception of it being too hot is entirely hormonal/physiologic and that I am being ridiculous with my complaints. He regularly asks me if I am menopausal or pre menopausal. I acknowledge that I take many medications following treatment for cancer a couple of years ago and do have a heat intolerance but the intolerance doesn\u2019t MAKE me hot nor do I ask for an unreasonable temperature correction. We are both overweight and actively working to lose weight. So I don\u2019t feel that that is as much of a factor as we both have that variable at play. I can only take so many clothes off but he doesn\u2019t feel he should be expected to wear additional clothing or use a blanket.  I am really struggling to not feel devalued in the choice to keep the house so hot. I will get so hot while cooking to the point that I need to open the windows and he gets very upset at that but at 79F the furnace runs constantly any way so the windows are only making me more comfortable in a hot space and not wasting energy/costing extra.  Am I being unreasonable/petty in my ask? AITA for opening the windows or am I justified in this frustration. For reference during the summer he will run the AC once the outside temp is hitting the 80\u2019s and will keep it at around 72-74F which is typically ok to warm for me but I can usually deal with that pretty well because at least it is cool air.  When he is away for at least several hours I turn the heat down as low as the settings allow or shut it off just for a break. This is the only time I adjust the thermostat. ",

        "selftext": "I\u2019m going to jump right in because the funeral is this Friday. My ex husband passed away last week in a car accident, very unexpectedly. The troopers came to my house (I\u2019m his emergency contact) to break the news. The first person I called was his father, and he flew out the next day with my exs sister. Before he flew out he asked me where we should have the service, in texas (where we live) or back in Maryland where our families and friends all still live.  I told him I felt like the service needed to be in Maryland because that was where everyone was and P (my exes father) agreed. He let me know the funeral home said they might be able to do a small viewing with just family and I agreed to doing that as long as I felt like he was in a condition he\u2019d be ok with.  I met my exes sister and his dad at the funeral home to go over paperwork and plan the viewing, he told me all the details for the funeral back home and we talked a bit about where my ex worked, his day to day life, his home, and the probate process. His father was taking care of the probate process and seemed defensive about some of his belongings, I really felt like focusing on my children was more important than arguing over small things in the home\u2026 all of that could wait so I backed off of helping with cleaning out him home and handed all of his insurance paperwork and other information I had that would be useful to them like contacts at his work and his electric login.  We had the viewing, both of our children said goodbye to their dad and it was very emotional. At the viewing I mentioned that a friend had paid for our tickets to fly home as I was quickly realizing how much everything was going to cost and I suddenly was without the financial help of their dad.. I was extremely thankful for their generosity.  After the viewing I didn\u2019t hear anything from his sister or dad, they didn\u2019t ask to see the kids or let me know what was going on with the process and I was actively trying to navigate the life insurance process while grieving my ex and helping my children with their feelings. The last few days have been a blur of crying and anger for all of us, we are so heartbroken to have lost him.  My exes sister and father flew out on Friday and around noon I got a call from his father telling me we were not welcome at the funeral and that my children and I would be a distraction to his (my exes father) families grieving.  I\u2019m shocked and hurt, I told him I had never heard anything so hateful and the conversation was over.  My exes father and sister have never visited texas, we\u2019ve lived here for 4 years. They were not close and had no idea where he worked, or even any recent photos of him. We were divorced but still good friends, and my ex was a devoted father. His children were his world.  AITA for not listening to his father and still taking them? The funeral is open to anyone, I can\u2019t imagine us being there among hundreds of other people will really be a problem.  Edit: for those asking his reason, he said \u201cwell I gave you a nice service here\u201d -we had a short viewing only and had previously agreed to the service being in Maryland so no, there was no service.  Also for clarity I am the beneficiary on the policies, my ex and I did his open enrollment together every year and we put each other as our beneficiaries to make it easier if anything like this ever did happen  I have a wrongful death attorney and he is helping me with the process but I will reach out to a probate attorney.  Thank you to everyone for the advice on SSI ",

        "selftext": "My junior prom is in May. It is the first prom I'll ever be attending. Me (17F) and my closest friend(17F) have always kind of assumed we would go together in a group unless we had dates(or at least that's what I thought). About 3 months ago me and my current day boyfriend(16M) got together. We love eachother and want to go to prom together. When I told my friend a few days ago he wanted to take me she acted like she was fine with it. Even texted me the next day saying she had made plans with another one of her friends. The day after that is when things went down. We were in class and she starts bringing up ideas of us going on a double date or going in a group together, but I tell her my boyfriend and I want it to be just him and I (I mean would anybody really want other people there when it's meant to be a date). Then after a few minutes she tells me that she is mad. She says she feels like I'm ditching her for him. She then states it's unfair bc it's our junior prom and his sophomore prom and that he should have known better. Is it just me, or is prom more of a couples dance than a friend one? I know she has had to work to be able to go to a dance more than others because she struggles with academics and this is the first dance she is able to attend this year. But I knew she had other people to go with (people who she literally told me she made plans with after she found out I was going with my bf). Idk, AITA for wanting to go with my boyfriend instead of my best friend? Edit: I would also like to mention that me and my boyfriend had been friends 7 months before we actually got together, so it's not like there was no history with him and I was ditching my friend for some guy I've only known 3 months.",

        "selftext": "I (19) live with four other people (ages 20 to 26). We split chores in the house evenly, but since living here, I've noticed a problem with personal dishes. It's typically a small issue, like the counter is overcrowded or all 12 of our spoons are on vacation (this is our polite way of saying that people need to bring dishes down from their room).  My issue this time, though, has to do with our dishes bin: in the kitchen, everyone has a designated spot to put their dishes if they need to do them later. It's helped declutter the counters a bit, although most of the large pots and pans are still left dirty on the stove and countertops for days at a time. The problem with the dishes bin is that once the mess is out of sight, it's out of mind.  Most of the time, people clean their dishes within two weeks. Occasionally something will go bad or they can't fit anymore dishes there and it's a reminder for them to clean up. However, on to the issue at hand, one of my housemates has had dishes sitting in their bin for almost a month.  The most notable object is a large mason jar with coffee in it that has dried significantly and produced a large amount of mold. Their dishes are also spilling out on top of the counter, as they have no more room in their bin. I don't like having something so unhealthy growing in our food space, and their extra dishes are taking up space others use for cooking. Normally, I would be fine with asking them to clean up. However, about three weeks ago, they told our house about a loss they experienced. I don't want to go into details for their privacy, but it had put a strain on them and they asked for some grace on their dishes.  Everyone agreed and consoled them, and I did as well. However, it's been three weeks now and the bioterror is still growing.  Other info: - I'm a working student, so I barely have time for my own life and dishes, so doing their dishes for them is out of the question. - We don't have a dishwasher. Our house is 100 years old and there literally isn't space.- While we do have meetings for our house on a regular basis, I would likely bring this up with them privately, in person.

I go to bed when he wakes up for work, I go to work as he's getting off, and I get home about an hour after he goes to sleep. We have lived in the same apartment for almost a year, and have known each other since we were 11. Our apartment is set up to where our rooms are across from each other and the living room/kitchen are connected. He likes to sleep in the living room in a recliner for some ungodly reason.  Normally I just get fast food bc its so late but I got tired of spending $8-12 a day to eat. I've started cooking, small things though, such as a couple eggs and some meat to make a sandwich. My A few days ago before i started i called him and said Hey you should probably sleep in your bed because im gonna start cooking and i don't wanna wake you up. He responded with It's fine if you wake me up I'll just go to sleep. I knew that's not was was gonna happen and I said that, but he dismissed it.  Well, guess what? Last night I cooked. Granted it was midnight, but it was my first time eating for the day, I wasn't hungry earlier, and I wasnt gonna go drive my car to go get fast food. Its wasting my time and money, and I already spent the money on groceries. Then he came in about an hour ago and was like Okay, cooking when im sleeping is fine but can we NOT do midnight?, and I said I told you to sleep in your room dude He goes My names on the place I can sleep where I want. SO I said then you're gonna get woken up dude you can sleep in your room that's what its for. Then i kinda just wanted him to leave before I got legitimately upset so I just started being homo-erotic and he thinks its weird so he shuffles off.  My entire view is you could literally just sleep in the room and avoid being woken up, plus its not like im banging pots and pans on purpose im being as quiet as I can. Am I the Asshole?  ",

        "selftext": "To give some back story I am about 14 weeks pregnant, my shower is planning for May 31st. my SIL and MIL asked me about a month ago to ask to plan my baby shower and I told them both that they could work together on this. I just found out I\u2019m having a girl about last week and was waiting to give them the go on planning the shower, I wanted to know the gender first then pick a theme then. I ended up picking Winnie the Pooh for the theme. My SIL and MIL are both control freaks, they both need to be in control of every situation and especially in party planning. I am not that way, I am the type of person that would be happy to do whatever is needed. They just had a lunch regarding baby shower talk, I thought this is a collaborating meeting and they would be delegating who would be doing what and paying for what. Mind you, my SIL is not contributing much but her time. My mil is contributing time and money. When the meeting was done, my SIL called me after the lunch and stated that my MIL was mad and completely changed when my SIL told her that everything was handled. Me and my MIL were under the impression that this was going to be a collaborative meeting, I didn\u2019t know my SIL had basically figured out everything already. My MIL was taken back by this understandably but my MIL is also very detailed orientated and wants things her done her way. My MIL states she has no say in the shower now and does not want to be apart of this anymore. I later asked my SIL to let her have some of the duties and my SIL basically said everything is done and there is nothing to do. My MIL called my husband and stated \u201cif you don\u2019t want me in this child\u2019s life just tell me\u201d over a disagreement over a baby shower and a discussion that I was not even involved in. I hate drama and I would rather not have the drama go on and cancel the baby shower entirely. Am I the asshole to cancel it entirely so they both cannot continue their antics?

        "selftext": "Last year, my fianc\u00e9 and I signed a lease for a townhome while planning our wedding, and I decided to get a roommate to help with expenses since we are living separately to save for the wedding. The place is furnished by us, but I left one room downstairs empty. My fianc\u00e9 stayed with me briefly approx. 3 weeks due to family issues, she only needed a place to sleep, and I made sure to talk to him about it, and he was fine with it.  Things got uncomfortable when my roommate got back with his girlfriend, who began spending more time at the house. It started with occasional visits, but soon, she was here so often it felt like she practically lived with us. I\u2019d come home to find her asleep on the couch, eating food from the fridge, she has her own place. This wasn\u2019t a huge problem at first, but it became more frequent, and she\u2019d sometimes be in the house when no one else was. Then my roommate had a friend stay for a week, leaving a mess. Although they cleaned it up eventually, it was annoying and uncomfortable. I decided to talk to my roommate about it, expressing that it was the frequency of his girlfriend being over that bothered me, and how it was affecting the shared living spaces. He was visibly annoyed and didn\u2019t talk to me much after that. Things didn\u2019t improve, and over time, I felt like I couldn\u2019t relax in the common areas because it seemed like they were irritated when I was around. I started staying in my room to avoid the tension. I didn\u2019t want to make things worse by bringing it up again, so I vented to my fianc\u00e9. She suggested I speak to him again, but I didn\u2019t want to keep pushing the issue. Eventually, I got the flu and decided to stay at my mom\u2019s house because I couldn\u2019t relax at home with his girlfriend there. My fianc\u00e9, not knowing where I was, drove over to check on me. I explained why I wasn\u2019t at the townhome, and she asked if I\u2019d talked to my roommate about my concerns. I admitted I hadn\u2019t. My fianc\u00e9 offered to talk to him since she\u2019s better at communicating, but when she did, he got annoyed, saying he could have his girlfriend over as much as he wanted since he paid bills & she is not someone he should have this conversation with only with me. Later, when I spoke to him, he said that if I could have my fianc\u00e9  living there, he should be allowed to have his girlfriend & any guest as much as he wants (my fianc\u00e9 only stayed 3 weeks, she has been here for 3 months). I tried explaining it wasn\u2019t about her staying over, but how frequently she was there. He accused me of double standards, which wasn\u2019t my intention. I don\u2019t want to micromanage him, but it bothers me when she\u2019s here alone or when he brings random people over. I even suggested that if he and his girlfriend want to live together, they could find their own place, but he just walked away, and nothing was resolved.",

I am still living at my parent\u2019s house while I am in the process of applying to vet school while I work at the local vet. My parents had approved having my long-distance gf (we\u2019ve been together for three years, recently long-distance since I just moved) over for the weekend to visit. She got in a little after 9:30 pm this past Friday. We had dinner, chatted, and went to bed. The next morning, I had a shift at the vet from 8:30-1 so I left early. In the meantime my gf (let\u2019s call her E) hung around and chatted with my parents about the new house and how they were settling in. They ate breakfast together and had a good time.  E had mentioned that she planned to go to Costco and would be gone about 45 mins. My parents were ok with this and let her know how to use our mechanized deadbolt. She left to get me lunch and met up with a mutual friend, who we\u2019ll call L. I had asked my mother about a week ago if L could stop by and get a tour of the house. She agreed. E comes back to the house with L fully expecting me to be back home from work. I was not. I had to stay two hours late because of several emergency cases. I could not answer my phone at this time and it was around 16F outside. E brought L in to use the bathroom and play with my dog for around a half hour. Then she left and went home.  Near the end of my shift I get a text from my mom telling me to call her ASAP. I clocked out and gave her a call. She and my father began yelling at me. They saw L come in on the Ring doorbell and were furious that E \u201clied to them\u201d when they asked her what her plans were that day. When they had asked her this, she was in the middle of texting L and deciding what they were doing. I had told E it was alright that L came in because my mom had ok\u2019d it. I fully thought that I would be home to show her around. She accused E of \u201clying by omission\u201d and not telling her that she would be bringing a \u201cstranger\u201d (she and I have known L for over a year) into the house.  My dad then chimed in and said that we better be gone by the time they get home because he \u201cdidn\u2019t want to see E because he didn\u2019t know what he would say to her.\u201d (My gf heard \u201cdidn\u2019t know what he would \u2018do\u2019 so we\u2019re not really sure). This screaming and berating went on for about a half hour. They constantly blamed E when she did nothing wrong. We packed up and left. E left a handwritten note to express how sorry she was, and that she never meant to \u201clie\u201d to them.  It was all just a big misunderstanding. My mom, who usually constantly checks on me to see how I am and sends me sweet little texts is completely giving me the silent treatment. We\u2019re set to come back today but I just don\u2019t know what to do/say. I never meant to go against their wishes and I would never blatantly disrespect them like that. I apologized and told them to blame me and not my gf, but they\u2019re not budging. ",

        "selftext": "Husband found a neighborhood dive bar with a pool table.  I don't drink much, but I like pool and we haven't gone to play for a long time.  I'm not good at it.  But it's fun.  So he hints around that he wants to go out, and after some back and forth he asks if I want to go to the bar. (Honestly at first it seemed like he didn't want me to go, and I was okay with staying home.). Anyway, I agree and we head out.  It's not far away and I even commented that I could be designated driver. For some reason that seemed to make him uncomfortable, but he brushed it off and off we went.  So I order my one drink, he gets his beer and some quarters and we play some pool.   Somewhere around the second game, an older guy at the bar starts critiquing my game, telling me which ball to shoot for, etc.  By the time we're into the third game and he's making his helpful suggestions, I stop and ask him (verbatim) excuse me, if you were playing, would you like someone to tell you how to play?. He took a second, said no, but you're bad at it.  I said I know, and took my shot.  Pretty tame?  At least I thought so.  Husband asks what I said to the guy so I told him... And he was upset!  Said I shouldn't have been rude.  We finished that game, I lost again and he wanted to leave.  He said I was rude, the guy was drunk and I should have ignored him.  That we were there to spend time with each other not get into a bar fight.  I said I was sticking up for myself and I think it's despicable that he'd be mad at me for that.  That I don't need him to stand up for me, and nobody was having a bar fight... But taking a strangers side over mine, calling me RUDE (I don't think I was rude) and really picking a fight with me makes him TA.   What do you think internet strangers? ",

I (19m) was at what i wouldve considered my main friend group if you asked me a month ago, I was already pissed off cause one of them stole something from me but I didn\u2019t know who so i looked at the guy who\u2019d asked to borrow it from me which what any person would do i think. Anyway i decided to forget it and just get drunk. Here comes the kicker, i had been invited to a party by some other people and it was relatively early so i thought why not? But we\u2019re a pretty tight group its just us we don\u2019t really go out with other people so i turned my location off for them. I had one drink at their place and then I went on my merry way. Then I got a text today saying i was an asshole this that for leaving them and lying saying i was gonna go home. So i told him that I went for one drink and he shouldn\u2019t be so dramatic because he told me us or them. He wouldnt listen and asked me again so I said you\u2019re not gonna tell me who i can talk to or not i dont give a fuck whether you like them or not I can have my own opinion. I mean they always bully me, destroy my shit or steal my shit and i was sick and tired of being treated that way and I dont like to fight so i just left.

I had been working with resin for awhile, but had never done flowers, and was completely upfront with that information.  She said she understood the risks, wanted me to try anyways, and gave me a $100 deposit for supplies (I needed deep pour resin, molds, and silica gel powder), and said to keep it no matter what, just try my best. And I did. I literally tried everything. I did test flower after test flower, thought I had it, but I failed terribly when I went to do the actual flowers. I sent her a message, and never heard back. Then suddenly, today, I get a message from her, asking for the $100 for the flowers back, she could really use it... well, so did I, 3 years ago, when I spent that money, plus some, on the supplies. I'm actually kind of hurt, as I didn't think she was that kind of person. She did just retire, and is on a limited income. And she saw I just opened an online store for polymer clay. Maybe she thinks I'm doing better than I am? Well, I'm not. I'm operating at a loss, not her problem, but then again, I don't feel like her retirement situation is my problem. I was also out of work twice this year due to medical reasons,  a spinal fusion in my neck and a broken foot, and I've been out of work 2 other times for major surgeries in the last 3 years. I don't think I should be responsible for reimbursing her, especially after all this time. AiTA??",

The internship ended and I ended up moving back to my city, so we couldnt really hangout but we did keep in touch. I ended up getting an offer for a full time job in his city, so when I started working there I told him and he immediately asked to hang out. This time I had no excuse so we made plans to hang out the following week. 2 days before, he cancels and tells me hes sick and can we move our hangout to the next week. I agreed and following up to that date, we kept chatting and I asked him how his job hunt is going.  He was struggling to get a job, so I told him he should reach out to the company we interned at the summer to see if they have any openings because they had also offered me a role, which I ended up accepting with a start date of next year, just so I can have it as a back up if I ever get laid off.  Right after that message he stops replying to me. 3 weeks go by and I dont hear anything, so I'm thinking maybe something bad happened, but I see him constantly posting on social media. So i reach out to him to see if everythings alright since I havent heard from him in a while. Again no reply.

        "selftext": "Alright, this started a while ago when myself (17f), and my friend, Eli (17m) decided to partner up for a school project. I've known Eli for around 4 years and we've been friends for the better part of that time. We decided to pair up because we were in the same class and he is a very sweet person.  Well, as you can probably guess, it didn't go off great. This project included two essays, plus another paper with two paragraphs and a data table (this was for a science class), and a slideshow. For our first essay, I ended up writing all except the conclusion, but he apologized and said he was busy with his extracurriculars (he is in theater and a few clubs, so he's more busy than me). I wrote the two paragraphs and made the data table, which again, he apologized for doing little.  Finally, when it came down to the second essay and slideshow, we agreed to split it 50/50. I finished my part a couple days before it was due, and every time I asked, Eli said he was working on it. However, the night before it was due Eli told me he needed me to do his part and he'd only wrote half a paragraph. I freaked because of the deadline and (somehow) finished his part in one night. We turned it in last week, and tbh I was pissed. When it came to our presentation he didn't even remember much about our project, which upset me more.  When I tried to express my thoughts, Eli accused me of overreacting and not being understanding and that he's been very busy. I get that life happens and he does more clubs than me, but with we had three weeks to do the final part. Am I really overreacting? Thanks.",

        "selftext": "For context, I have a close friend whom I\u2019ve known since middle school whose mental and physical health have suffered a lot in the past two years, and I really do feel for her but sometimes our relationship has been much more difficult lately than it used to be because she now needs a lot more attention than I can give, and there\u2019s been tension between us on and off for a while. Right now she is extra unhappy with me. My husband and I suffered a miscarriage this month and right now there is a condolence gift from her waiting for me at the post office since Tuesday (it\u2019s Sunday) because no one was home to sign for it, and I have not had the energy (or the burning desire, to be honest) to go pick it up.  This is probably made worse by the fact that she is someone who wants to hang out all the time, and I haven\u2019t wanted to see anybody or do anything in about 3 weeks. She sent a card too which was very sweet, and I thanked her for that and thanked her for sending me a gift, but I let her know that I didn\u2019t have a chance to pick it up yet and was not sure exactly when I would. I will pick it up. I will! But I want to give myself a minute. Because: 1. I don\u2019t like stuff. It doesn\u2019t actually matter what it is. My love language is not gifts. When I buy something and bring it into our house, I choose it really carefully and think about it for a long time. I can pretend well enough to be gracious and give people the response they want from me when I receive a gift, but my true feelings are that I hate receiving gifts because they almost always become a chore, one more thing to add to the pile of things to find a new home for without just chucking them and adding to the landfills. I hate things, I can never punt enough things out of my home fast enough, and I hate this about our culture. 2. Trips to the post office are my least favorite kind of errand. Our post office doesn\u2019t have a parking lot, there are always lines, etc. I avoid having to go there even when I\u2019m not depressed and dealing with something, so the truth is I\u2019m a little annoyed that she set me up for an obligatory post office trip. Though I know better than to ket her know that.  She doesn\u2019t understand and is upset that I didn\u2019t make haste to cut through my grief and depression to go pick up this gift (which yes, as an aside, has a very good chance of being something I will not want, and which I\u2019ll need to drum up energy to find a new home for at some point.) Am I cranky, depressive, isolating? Yes. But am I allowed? AITA?",

        "selftext": "AITA for not summarizing TV shows for my husband? [Update in comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/qm07zWV2xg) Ongoing argument between my husband and me. I'll be watching a show, and he'll come in partway through and watch a few minutes. He might watch bits and pieces as he comes and goes. Since he knows a little about what's happening, when he comes back he'll ask, So what happened with the suspect? Why did they break up? It's not always a one sentence answer, and it takes me out of watching the show to have to summarize what happened. And I know it sounds silly, but if I'm watching a show to relax, I don't want to have to sit and think about how to explain what happened.  Our most recent argument was when I was watching Will Trent and he had asked me 3-4 questions already that I answered. Finally he asked me another, and I told him, exasperated, to just look online. (Something I've started saying to him when I don't want to answer.) He argued that it would just take a few seconds to answer the question. I told him any reasonable person would agree with me, so here we are. Btw, this is not a serious fight. I am exasperated with him, but neither of us are seriously upset and we love each other very much. Even if I do want to throw a pillow at him when he does stuff like this.  So what says reddit? Edited to give my husband's perspective: I was in the middle of watching the episode, and fell asleep. When I woke up, the episode was over. I asked my wife how it ended and she refused to tell me.",

A lot of my younger years was spent forcing myself to be extroverted with long periods of high social activity in group settings with my family (most which involved alcohol). Since giving it up I realised I drank heavily in these settings because of social anxiety. I visited my sisters with my dad (63m) and his partner (50f) this weekend. My dad promised the visit was a couple of hours, it turned into an overnight and as I had travelled with them and even then still late getting back the day after. I went to my mums (whose lives in the same town) who understood but still I was forced into high tension social environment again before I got to leave and I wanted to cry from frustration. I know my siblings will bitch at my lack of involvement with their kids so between it and being pushed out of my safe space with my dad, I just want to cry with frustration. In future I know not to be reliant on him but I\u2019m frustrated as my boundary was pushed by him and by my sisters who I know will not be happy with me ",

        "selftext": "So just a brief intro, I was living away from home for uni up until recently, and my brothers (29 + 23) are still living there, having never moved out for a whole host of reasons which I won't get into here but will be happy to elaborate on if anyone is interested. It basically boils down to substance abuse issues and then getting the easy life at home, being provided for by my 60 year old mother. She buys all their food, amongst other things, that's important to keep in mind. I recently moved back to my mum's in order to save money while I save to move country to do my masters degree. It has been quite unbearable, to be honest, trying to adjust to the lack of independence. Anyway lol, I have a pretty specific diet, namely Whole Foods, Plant Based - I don't eat added/processed sugar, dairy/meat/animal products etc. Because of this, I buy ALL my own food and don't touch the stuff my mum buys for them bc they eat a pretty Standard American Diet, which is of no interest to me.  The issue is, for the last few months since I moved back, my food is constantly being eaten. Despite the fact that I have taken to writing my name on my food with black sharpie as they were (potentially feigning) ignorance originally. Just this week for example, a good lot of my veg has been eaten, they somehow went through a full loaf of wholegrain bread overnight, my hummus was half eaten, my falafel, pickles, no-added sugar baked beans, my homemade veg burgers amongst others were all eaten. Bizarrely, my vegan cheese was eaten when they have actual dairy cheese available to them IN THE SAME FRIDGE. I have said to them multiple times, but they get very defensive and say it's only a few quid or it's only frozen veg, what like 40p? I have said to my mum as well twice now, tho I don't want to go on at her bc it's not her problem and she's already stressed enough, and her response is pretty much the same, even saying what do you expect of course they'll eat what's in the fridge. There is no acknowledgement on my brothers' parts of the fact that it's not really about the money (tho that's certainly part of it), but about the principal of respect and boundaries. I feel like I'm genuinely going insane. Should I stop going on about it? I do feel like an AH for bringing it up all the time, but then i also feel strongly that their behaviour should change and not my reaction to it. Idk, what do yous think? ",

        "selftext": "I, (28 male), and my fianc\u00e9, (22 female), let's call Jenny, both work 8 hours a day, Monday through Friday, but with different schedules. While Jenny is saving up for a car and working on getting her license, I drive her to her job, where she works 8:00am to 5:00pm. I then go back home and go back to sleep until 11:45am-12:00pm to get ready for my job, which goes from 2:00pm to around 10:45pm. Jenny gets a ride home from work with a coworker, and gets home at either 5:45pm-ish or 8:00pm-ish, depending on whether her and her coworker went to the gym. She starts getting ready to go to bed by 8:45 every week night, and she is asleep by the time I get home around 11:00pm. We have a bathroom in our bedroom with a corner shower, where we both shower at different times, and since it's right next to the wall against the bed, you can hear everything that goes on in there. I also have a computer about 5 feet away from the end of the bed that has a clacky keyboard and fans that can admittedly get pretty noisy. Jenny has an anxiety-based insomniac condition that makes it really hard for her to stay asleep when there are a ton of noises around the room through the early hours of the morning. I try to go to bed at around 3:00am since I'm a night owl, but climbing into our creaky full-size bed wakes them up every single time, even with three different sources of white noise, i.e. the fan, an app on her phone, and an ASMR video on the tv with the screen off and a sleep-timer. She's been getting more and more irritated as of recently, A few days ago, she had a very stressful and emotionally hard day at work, due to her exhaustion that has accumulated over the weeks. She's trying to find a therapist or make a doctor's appointment to get on some good sleep meds, anything that's stronger than over-the-counter meds, but it's hard for her to find time on top of her job all day and trying to go to the gym three times a week. I'm very remorseful about the amount of stress that I've caused her, but it's my bedroom, too, and I have things I need to get done in our room after work that I otherwise wouldn't have time for.

He is currently in school for web development and has been working to become proficient with PC. He now knows more about coding than me and has become quite proficient. When his flight Sim broke, he asked me to fix it. I politely told him I can't fix everything, it's probably a simple issue, this is a good test for you. You should try and fix it. Start with steam, get the quest to connect to steam and then try to get it to connect to flight Sim. If you still have trouble, I will help but you need to try yourself. he then responded can't I just reinstall windows and start from scratch?. I told him, no don't do that, we installed loads of crazy drivers to get your Mac studio display to work on a pc. If you reinstall Windows, that will all be gone and I Dont wanna have to go through that nightmare again. Do not reaintall windows.  A few days later he is asking me to fix his pc because he has reinstalled windows. This really upset me since I told him not to. I told him no, that it is now his problem.

        "selftext": "Okay so I (29M) started college when I was 17. Because of my family\u2019s income and general status I was not granted much financial aid for college. Because I have 2 younger siblings, and my parents had other financial responsibilities, my parents could not afford to pay out-of-pocket for my undergrad and I was not granted nearly enough in personal loans. The school my parents and I agreed on is a private university, and tuition was high.  Because of the cost of the college, personal loans were taken out in my name, and my parents took out Parent Plus Loans in their name. Now I work full-time and my loans are on an income-driven repayment plan. I am easily able to manage my monthly payments on those (the ones in my name). However, my issue is that my parents are demanding monthly payments for the ParentPlus Loans taken out in their names. Their stance is that the loans were taken out for me and my education, so I am responsible for repaying them. The ParentPlus Loans cannot be transferred to me, and the payments are literally half of my income each month, because the lowest payment option is based on THEIR income, which is significantly higher than mine.  I have been paying them monthly for a year, and this has forced me to live paycheck to paycheck, unable to save for a car or house. I can\u2019t start a family, and I can\u2019t progress financially in any way due to immediately having to spend every dollar I earn on those payments plus rent/bills/insurance/groceries/therapy/etc\u2026 The ParentPlus Loans are currently in forbearance (since October) until April. This past week I told my parents I will not be resuming payments on them due to 1) Its not my loan. 2) We (Americans) are about to get hit with a recession/depression. 3) I cannot advance in any way making these payments. My mother has responded saying that\u2019s not an option because their retirement and/or credit will be ruined by this choice, and that I will owe them the money. AITA for wanting to stop these payments?  TLDR; My parents took out a loan for me to go to college, but the loan was in their name. They now expect me to pay them back for it, but I can\u2019t afford it. AITA for discontinuing payments so I can afford to live somewhat comfortably?  Edit 1 (More Info): There was no clear communication about repayment discussed when the loans were taken out. My mom took control of financial planning of my college, and I was very passive in the process, unaware any loans were taken out in their name until payments started being due. If they were my personal loans, they would be payed based on my current income. Edit 2 (More Info): My parents didn\u2019t force me to go to a specific school, but also I wasn\u2019t really provided choices. When I graduated high school, the discussion was basically \u201cSo you\u2019re going here, right? Because that\u2019s the best option.\u201d and there wasn\u2019t more debate or discussion on it. I liked the school. My parents liked the school. I didn\u2019t really take ownership of that decision or fight it because my mom took charge of college stuff for me.  Edit 3 (More Info): My parents knew what types of loans were being taken out. They both work in banking/finance, and know how money/loans work. And again, my mom took full accountability/ownership for the financial planning of my college.  Edit 4 (Wording): I have no stopped the payments yet. Adjusted wording to reflect that I want to stop making them. The loans are currently in forbearance. There was no sudden stop of payments to my parents. Edit 5 (Idek): People seem to think I\u2019m set on my opinion. I\u2019m here to listen, learn, and grow. I\u2019m not trying to screw over my parents, and I\u2019m not accusing my parents of being malicious. I\u2019m trying to come up with solutions that my parents and I can use as a team to combat this. And I want to hear all perspectives on the situation. Attacking me by saying I hate my parents or vice versa is simply not true, and not helpful. Edit 6: Because people are still attacking me for being \u201cselfish\u201d or \u201chating my parents\u201d I need to be VERY clear that I am here, again, to listen and learn. You are able to communicate your perspectives respectfully. I don\u2019t hate my parents, nor do they hate me. I\u2019m not set on any plan other than working as a team with my parents to combat this. No one is cutting anyone off unless this escalates wildly and unexpectedly. Yall need to chill on the personal attacks. I can be in the wrong about something without being villainized. If I\u2019m in the wrong, just point it out and explain why. No need to attack me beyond that. Final Edit: Leaning ESH on my own post. Thanks to everyone who has been kind and given me insight, advice, support, and reassurance. My mom and I are working towards coming up with a plan so neither me nor my parents will be screwed over by this. People who kindly and respectfully disagreed with me, you are appreciated. This issue is no longer Me vs My Parents. It\u2019s now Me & My Parents vs The Problem. Thanks all except those menaces who for some reason think I should hate my parents or vice versa. \u2665\ufe0f\ud83d\udd7a\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udd25 ",

(My girlfriend is Mexican by the way) She has already met my parents and they absolutely love her. But every time we go to my families thanksgiving\u2019s, my aunt and grandma always joke about my girlfriends heritage, for example, in 2023, when she went to grab some beans to go with her food, my aunt said \u201cof course she wants beans\u201d and my grandma and uncle laughed. It wasn\u2019t funny at all. Last years thanksgiving (2024), me and my girlfriend went to my parents house, as they were hosting, and everything was good. That was until my aunt and uncle came, and straight away they were talking about how Mexicans never say thank you, and that they should go back to where they came from. I became angry, practically livid, and began to shout at them, revealing all my aunts secrets, about how her marriage is practically hanging on a thread, how her child is depressed because of her, and how an alcohol addiction wouldn\u2019t change any of that. Me and my girlfriend left after that. Now half of my family  are telling me that I\u2019m in the wrong, and the other half are saying that I did the right thing. My parents are saying that whilst she was in the wrong, I shouldn\u2019t have brought all of that up. So AITA?Edit: I probably didn\u2019t bring up a lot of context in my last post, but I will try my best to add some now. I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder since I was 13 years old and have a tendency to get angry easily. It has gotten better over the years, but still little stuff can get to me. My aunt, uncle and grandma have been making little remarks at my girlfriend for years. When I first introduced her to them, my grandma pulled me aside and told me to keep an eye on my girlfriend, saying that \u201cshe might steal\u201d from my house. My girlfriend has dealt with racism most of her life, and explained that she isn\u2019t comfortable with it. She also has anxiety, which makes her extremely uncomfortable with altercations, which is why she hasn\u2019t said anything to them about their racist comments. She even asked me if we could go to her family\u2019s thanksgivings instead of mine because of the blatant racism that my aunt and grandma constantly bring up.",

        "selftext": "My parents got divorced and my mom moved out. I was still living at the house with my dad and I was covering the utilities which I agreed to help. I had been with my girlfriend(now fianc\u00e9e at the time of their divorce). Well I pretty much moved in with her and was staying at her house during the week and going home on the weekends. It eventually changed to never really going back home unless I needed to speak to my dad about something. He\u2019s been a heavy drinker for most of my life which he still is at this point. Me and my fianc\u00e9e have a baby on the way and we\u2019ve been looking for a place to live and we found one. The only bad thing about the whole situation is that my dad is looking as well and he\u2019s been bugging me about co-signing on a loan with him to get a house but he keeps telling me that he\u2019s going to pay it off with the money from house when it sells. But he\u2019s been saying that we could all move in together and I just don\u2019t think it would be a good idea with the baby and I also don\u2019t feel comfortable doing it and I explained to him because of mine and fianc\u00e9es situation. But anyways, yesterday me and her went to my dads house(that\u2019s currently being sold) to pack some stuff up and he was leaving to go take a walk and he said to me that \u201cI killed him for not co-signing with him\u201d. I\u2019m feeling really guilty about it and it\u2019s been tugging at my heart. I just want to know\u2026 Am I the asshole and in the wrong for not helping him? Or should I have helped and jeopardized me and my fianc\u00e9e\u2019s future?  -EDIT-Okay so I apologize to everyone that has replied about not providing enough information I was typing this out on my phone and didn\u2019t want a massive paragraph for everyone to read. So I\u2019m going to answer some of the questions that I was seeing in the comments. Me(M26) and my fianc\u00e9e (F27) have been together since 2018 and have a baby on the way that will be born in May. We are going through the buying process of a home currently. My father and mother are getting half of the money that the house is being sold for after the remaining balance of the house is paid but the only reason he wants me to co-sign on the loan is because his credit isn\u2019t the best. He got a DUI a couple years ago so he doesn\u2019t car so he basically relies on me to take him places which I don\u2019t mind taking if I have time and it\u2019s places like the grocery store, appointments, etc. but I feel like he\u2019s been getting pretty comfortable with it cause he doesn\u2019t ask me anymore just basically demands that I do it now.

I work M-F at a Montessori school. I take my 2yo year old with me to work. So we don\u2019t have to get a babysitter. So I watch him 24/7 Sat I usually drive to my grandmas she cooks dinner we do laundry and take showers . I like to drive back to our house Sun, so we can sleep in our own beds, not air mattresses sun night, and then I don\u2019t have to drive an hour and 15 mins to work Mon. Our house is 3 mins frm the school I\u2019d rather not be preggers sitting in a car for over an hour after a crappy night of sleep with a potentially crabby 2 yo  jumping into work My husband bartends so weekends are big he will work till about midnight. For WEEKS we have had the argument that he wants us to sleep over 1 more night, and do the drive Mon instead of Sun. I have caved and done that before, here is how it goes he gets off between 10-12. Drives the hr, our son is asleep when he gets there.  I get preg insomnia especially sleeping uncomfortably there. So I\u2019m awake but he goes straight to bed. Our son wakes up 1-2 times at night which he doesn\u2019t hear so I do those wake ups (they don\u2019t really happen at our house) in the morning we eat and I try to wrangle the 2yo into the car on time &not  be late for work. Hubs gets to shower then he drive separately back My argument\u2026.. why do I need to be there? If he wants to come shower he is more than welcome to. But I would like to be able to go home Sun and it feels pointless for me stay Sun if it makes my life more difficult but seems like he would be doing the exact same thing whether I was here or not. He has a good relationships with my fam they would have no problem him being at my grandmas without me. He says I\u2019m being selfish and not thinking or him/caring about his needs. I just genuinely completely don\u2019t understand.  It hurts me to stay that Sun, and it doesn\u2019t seem like he needs me here, wants me here? I\u2019m sure he\u2019s a little more comfortable with me here. But the logistics for him doesn\u2019t change.  AITA?",

        "selftext": "First off all the disclaimers: Sorry for formatting I am on my phone and also English us not my first language so I apologize for any errors. I (34f) broke up with my Ex Boyfriend (40m) last June, so a little over 7 months ago. There wasnt any big blowout reason, the relationship just didn't work out for me. I put in all the effort while he always provided the bare minimum and at some point I just didn't feel like taking care of a grown ass man anymore. It was really hard on him and he kept texting me for a while. I replied politely but also told him he needs to move on. It was just too little too late. I know I may sound coldhearted but I had my reasons to break up with him and I didn't really want to stay in constant contact or keep being friends. So yesterday I was out with my siblings and he randomly calls me. I have a tendency to people pleasing so my sister took my phone, rejected the call and texted him that I was unavailable due to being out with them.He texted back asking me to call him when I was available because something bad happened.  So I finally grew a spine and told him I couldn't provide him emotional support and to please understand. He then texted me that his mother had passed away and he just needed someone to talk to and how could I be so cold towards him.This is where I might be the asshole because I still did not want to call him and be his emotional support. I just want to stay out of this and as sad as I am for him I don't want to be involved in this. So am I the Asshole?",

        "selftext": "My boyfriend (23) and I (female, 24) met at our corporate job. We hit it off immediately and started dating. Although it might seem odd, this was my first dating experience. In the beginning, he was incredibly sweet, caring, and attentive. He often brought me snacks and cooked meals for me, and I reciprocated as much as I could. While I appreciated his attention, I also wanted to take care of him and show my affection, so I occasionally bought him small gifts. Initially, he was emotional and happy about them. However, over time, he began to criticize the gifts I gave him, calling them useless and not what he wanted. For his birthday, I bought him a childhood game he had mentioned he never got to play but still felt nostalgic about. I thought it would be a thoughtful gift to fulfill his childhood dream, and I added some expensive snacks. He seemed joyful at first, but the next day, he shamed me for it, comparing my gift unfavorably to an even more expensive gift from his best friend. He called my gift childish and useless, gave it to his nephew, and said he couldn't eat the snacks, so he gave them to his brothers. I felt very upset and explained my intentions, but I didn't want to let him control my mood, so I brushed it off and tried to forget about it. After this incident, I became discouraged from buying him anything. One day, I noticed that the calluses on his hands were getting worse, so I bought him weightlifting gloves. As soon as he saw them, he commented on how ugly they were and insisted I should return them. I was just trying to be thoughtful, and I never expected such a reaction. I felt so disappointed, but again, I brushed it off and stopped gifting him anything. For context, he only gave me a gift once, and that was on my birthday. I'm not trying to shame him, but I wish he would consider my thoughtfulness when I buy him things. Even if he didn't like them, he could at least pretend and not put me down. Now, with Valentine's Day approaching, I feel so discouraged from buying him anything. ",

        "selftext": "My husband and I (both in our 40s) have a pretty decent split of household chores and maintenance type items. One of my chores is cleaning the bathrooms. I am also quite handy around the house and don't mind rolling up my sleeves to get dirty, so I also snake any drains when they get clogged up. (Sinks, showers, etc.) This is a skill that I have taught myself out of necessity. It's not something we specifically discussed as being my chore/obligation, but I took it on to be helpful and do my part because we are a team.  That said...He is a man and shaves his face. He does this over his bathroom sink, of course, and makes minimal effort to prevent his trimmings and shaving products from going down the drain even though I have asked him to do better many times. Predictably, his sink needs to be snaked every few months because he has clogged it up yet again. I have taken care of this every time so far, albeit begrudgingly. Anyone who has performed this task will understand just how putrid and vile it can be in there. I am getting tired of cleaning up an easily preventable mess and am refusing to snake his sink this time. I told him he should take care of it, but it remains unaddresed several weeks later. Mind you, he doesn't know how to do it and I have offered to teach him. I am attempting the teach our kid this as well, because it is a life skill.  Also relevant: we have been in our home for like 14 years and I have never had to snake my bathroom sink and have had to snake our shower exactly one time (I do my best to collect my hair and throw it away to prevent it from clogging the drain). I feel like he is a grown ass man who is capable of cleaning up after himself and him refusing to do so is not something I should be punished for.  I also acknowledge that since I have been doing this task that there is a reasonable expectation for me to continue doing it, but this is above and beyond occasional clogs from normal use.  Sooo...

        "selftext": "Hi All, My dad calls me often when he\u2019s been drinking or high. When I see his number, I know what it ultimately is for - money. Context, I grew up in a large family and my dad was rarely in my life. He and my mom were constantly fighting; he would beat her and we would need to move to get away from him. He always found his way back to us. He wasn\u2019t a great father figure. He didn\u2019t provide for us and neither could my mom. So, we grew up poor.  I never really liked him. I thought of him as a terrible father and human being, but as he\u2019s gotten older, he\u2019s softer and I am at the age where I get to see his personality. Maybe it\u2019s because he\u2019s in his 60s and I\u2019m in my 40s that we can have the relationship we have. You see, I don\u2019t have the energy to argue with him, and he\u2019s too old to be petty (like he used to be). So, our conversations are about life and what to look out for as you get older. He tries to go down memory lane, but I hate it because he\u2019s only able to talk about the years when I was in grade school (ages 0 - 10). He\u2019s picked up on it and doesn\u2019t bring up the past as much. Anyway, I\u2019m an engineer and I make a great living. My wife is a professional in health care and she earns a great living, too. Together we make $46k per month. I would say we\u2019re a middle class family with a middle class lifestyle. Why is this important? Because when my dad calls, he always asks for money. The money isn\u2019t a lot. It is usually $100 dollars. He calls every other day. Now I hate giving him money because 1) it feels like he use me as an ATM 2) he takes the money to go buy drugs and alcohol and 3) I have a feeling the asks are going to get larger. He\u2019s always talking about moving in my home (he says it\u2019s a joke, but I know it\u2019s not).  One day while we were on the phone he said, \u201cSend me $100 since I know you have it\u201d, and I said \u201cI\u2019m not going to send you any more money\u201d. He then tells me \u201cI know you\u2019re going to send it because you always do\u201d. Now, he\u2019s right because even though I say I\u2019m not, I\u2019ll still cash app him the money. I\u2019m upset with his presumption about what I\u2019ll do. This has irritated me so much so that I\u2019ve stop answering his calls the last few days. When I went over our expenses for the year (this is only because we\u2019re preparing our taxes), I noticed that I\u2019ve given him close to $20k for the year. Again, it doesn\u2019t harm our finances, but $20k is a lot of money.  AITA for cutting him off and no longer taking his calls and sending him money? ",

        "selftext": "Im quite bad at story telling so kindly ask for clarification if needed. My family is Asian. For context my sibling 37M is married (2nd time) and we usually don't get along well together. Now he wanted to come back and stay with parents for the time being cause his wife needs to rest at her parent's home(its nearby).I vehemently refused his presence cause we need to share a bathroom. He works from home so he locks his room , won't open the room to allow me to use the bathroom. Other bathrooms are there in house but my parents are old and frequently need to use it. While he stays at home he doesn't help out in household chores, throws a fit if someone tries to use the room/clean the room even. Meanwhile I am the one the parents call whenever they have inconveniences , need to pay online bills, take them to hospital and clean up after them. Surprisingly before his wife got pregnant he apparently wasnt able to move in with parents with wife cause he needed to go to office once a week. Suddenly he is able move back in ? Also I must apparently use the bathroom during normal hours cause needing to poop at 6.30 am in morning is not a normal hours. Hence my refusal to let him move back in. AITA for refusing to put up with him and compromising?  Edit: Cannot move out for atleast next month or so cause I spent last 3 years getting a degree. Awaiting the documents and for other paperwork. Till then I cannot legally work anywhere. 2. Parents have incontinence issues hence need for their own bathroom and privacy. 3. My income over the years has been  less than him since I am younger by almost 8 years. Hence I have just started my earnings whereas he has been working for long and is now earning more along with perks provided by company. My field does not provide me with that sort of salary even at highest position and perks will not be given at any point in life.  Edit 2: Parents also offered to rent out another place nearby which is 1 min away from our house. Either i would move there or they can. He refused. In-laws also welcomed him to stay with them and he does not want to go there as well. ",

        "selftext": "Hey Reddit  I (24f) bought some pants a couple of months back from an online thrifting website. The pants are unique and I payed a reasonable amount for them. I asked for the measurements and they should fit my size. I was super excited to receive them. I\u2019ve struggled my whole life finding pants that fit my body type and this time yet again they didn\u2019t fit around my hips.  My friend (25f) is smaller than me. I\u2019ve given her pants and other clothes before I couldn\u2019t fit. Not that long ago I gave her some unique pants again found thrifting online and they fit her perfectly. She got to buy them for a cheap price. She loved them and wore them often and it honestly hurt to see the pants I was so excited to fit me actually fit her.  So this time around I got some pants that of course yet again are too small. Instead of showing them to my friend first, because she\u2019s a smaller fit, I decided to put them on sale online instead.  I showed her my profile on the online thrifting website and she saw the pants and she now insists on trying them on.  I\u2019m well aware that I\u2019m playing into my insecurities and my jealousy when telling her that I\u2019d rather sell them online for a stranger to wear them instead of her, because it hurts too much to see her wear the pants I got excited would fit me. I have explained this to her and she\u2019s thinks I\u2019m being very unreasonable.  So, am I the asshole for not letting my friend try the pants I recently bought - instead I want to sell them online? Am I playing too much into my insecurities - should I let her try the pants and let her buy them if they fit?  Edit: Update!First of all, selling clothes online came up as a conversation topic and I brought up that I just started selling online. She then wanted to see my profile and spotted the pants. I did not smear the pants in her face just for me to tell her she can\u2019t have them. In hindsight, maybe I should\u2019ve just not told her I started selling online but I swear to god it wasn\u2019t some kind of evil plan to make her envious of my pants and jerk her around. Second of all, I am not jealous that she is smaller than me. I\u2019m jealous she can fit the pants I put my time and effort into finding. Good thrift finds are hard to come by. Third of all, she was not mad at me for not letting her try them on. She just didn\u2019t understand my reasoning. To all of you saying I need serious help; I am actively seeking help for my insecurities and have been through therapy before. After almost 15 years of friendship, me and my friend are very close - almost a sister status. We read all your replies and it opened up a healthy and interesting conversation between the both of us which only made our friendship stronger.  Thanks to all of you. You helped me realise that it\u2019s okay for me to have insecurities and that my feelings are valid, but I see now and I agree with a lot of you that it\u2019s border-lining pettiness and I will try my best work against that sooooo: I let her try the pants on (!!) and oh well she didn\u2019t even fit them lol, but a good conversation came out of it and from now on I won\u2019t hide them from my friend but I will definitely demand the same price I\u2019m selling them for online.",

        "selftext": "I (f26) and my fianc\u00e9 (m30) are getting married later this year and we've recently began sending out the invitations. We've said from the beginning that we're only inviting partners of family members if we know them and that we're not going to be inviting partners that we don't know or are in fairly new relationships. We hand delivered invitations to my fianc\u00e9's family and invited some partners (that we know and get along with well and have essentially been a part of the family as they've been around for a while), but other partners that we do not know have not been invited. I will note however that we haven't invited my mils partner as he's awful to my mil and we just do not like him for many reasons. Today we went to visit my fianc\u00e9's grandparents and before we were able to properly greet them his grandmother began yelling at us that were horrible for not inviting his cousins partners (who we do not know and they've not been together for more than a couple of months) and that we're selfish for not wanting to pay extra money to invite them all and that family should come first regardless of how long they've been family for  We told her that we have invited all immediate family but not the people we don't really know and I told her it wasn't her place to decide who should and should not get an invitation to our wedding. She then began yelling at me claiming that we were treating my family better than my fianc\u00e9's and that I'd probably invited more people from my family than his (not true there are immediate members of my family who we are not inviting), she then called me an awful dil to my mil as mils partner isn't invited, as I said previously he's abusive to mil and just makes me incredibly uncomfortable.  So are we the arseholes for not inviting everyone's partners to our wedding? Edit: long term partners, fianc\u00e9's ect are invited it's just short term partners that we do not know with the exception of one that aren't invited.  This is the case for both sides of the family not just my fianc\u00e9's, as I've already seen a few comments implying that I am treating my fianc\u00e9's family different to my own, we are not and after the wedding it's one family and I'm already treating it as such. We have a budget that can accommodate 70 people, we've invited immediate family and some very close friends, we've been prioritising those who we really want to share our day with, and not put ourselves into severe debt. I don't want to not invite some family and close friends to accommodate plus ones we have never met. Edit: I realised I've only used the term plus one however every single invited has incorporated names only so everyone is a named guest and we've not give. Any plus ones plus ones I'm not sure if that will change anything however.",
