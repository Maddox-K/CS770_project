        "selftext": "  I got invited to my fiance's family christmas celebratory dinner. It's my first christmas with them. I have always been picky about what I eat. Can't help it and it has to do with psychological factors, childhood, and personal likes and dislikes. Before accepting their invite I let FMIL know that I wouldn't be eating the traditional food at their celebration, and showed her a variety of dishes to choose from to accommodate me. She refused and told me to bring my own dish. I said if I had to bring my own dish when I'm a guest then I better stay at home then. We went back and forth and I insisted I wouldn't come if accommodations weren't being made. I just thought it was a simple request and FMIL could've agreed if she really wanted me there. My fiance agreed that I shhould bring my own dish but I didn't. When we arrived there and I saw that no accommodations were made I got up, go my things and walked out and went home. My FMIL and fiance were shocked. I got tons of calls and texts from them both and my fiance came home lashing out calling me selfish and spoiled to walk out like that over a dish that his mom didn't have to make for me. and, that it was my responsibilty to feed myself. How is it my responsibilty to feed myself when I'm a guest? Makes no sense to me. I told him this and he accused me of starting shit and ruining my first christmas with his family and disrespecting his mom.  Now he's continuelly saying I fucked up and should've sucked it up for the family's sake. ETA to clear few points: * For those saying I have no respect for my inlaws. I do, especially FMIL. I respect her but this is so far the biggest conflict we had. * I work long hours even on holidays so not much time to cook. * I wasn't asking for an elaborated dish or several dishes. Just one simple option.",

        "selftext": "I\u2019ve (M32) been with my girlfriend (F29) for over a year now. She\u2019s smart, funny, a bit quirky, and has a serious job with a good salary. We have a great time together and generally get along very well. The only thing is her choice in home \u2018decor\u2019 is bizarre, to put it frankly, and not something you think a normal, grown adult would be into.  Her apartment is definitely a reflection of herself and interests. Not in the best way though.  My girlfriend has wall dedicated to animation in one room of her apartment, like Futurama pieces and etchings of some weird triangle guy. Then there\u2019s the wall of framed preserved insects in another room. But not insects like butterflies or moths. Instead she displays tarantulas, beetles, and large stick insects. Her bathroom has a subtle theme of the ocean-pretty common. But instead of starfish or shells, she has a little anglerfish nightlight, a small vampiric squid painting, and then a framed diagram of what apparently is a Goblin Shark right by the toilet.  I would say a majority of her home decor and furnishings are okay. The apartment itself is very modern and sleek. It\u2019s just the random decor and juvenile-ish themes like cartoons, insects, and bizarre ocean creatures, is off putting. This is where I might be the AH. I avoid bringing people over to her place, especially people from my job, because of how juvenile it looks. Everyone\u2019s impressed when they see the high rise, but that quickly fades once you enter. The one time I brought a work colleague over they ended up telling me after that they found her insect wall terrifying. I work in finance and appearances and first impressions are important. My office will hold casual gatherings where we get together for a few drinks, good food, and we rotate hosts. And this time, it\u2019s my turn. The problem is my place is under some construction and not an ideal place to be right now, so I\u2019ve been staying with my girlfriend. My girlfriend suggested that we host my colleagues here since she has the space and thinks it\u2019ll be fun. I told her I planned on skipping my rotation and seeing if the next person would be okay with hosting early. She kept pressing on why I didn\u2019t want them over here, so I finally said it\u2019s because her home decor is strange and not something a grown woman would have, and also that her insect wall horrified the one colleague that did come over.  My girlfriend got mad and said at the end of the day, it\u2019s not my space and these things bring her joy. She also said that she is indeed an adult woman, which is exactly why her apartment is decorated in such a manner.  I love my girlfriend, I do. And it\u2019s okay to have different interests. But does an adult really need to decorate with them besides a few things here and there? I mean, my own mother asked if my girlfriend was autistic after she saw the entire apartment for the first time. So Reddit, AITA for telling my girlfriend her home decor is the reason I won\u2019t host a work gathering at her place?",

        "selftext": "This didn\u2019t happen yet but my whole family is fighting over this. I\u2019ll try to make this as short as possible.  My father passed away in December. He owned a classic car. I believe it\u2019s a 50s Chevy bel air. My son (17) is the only grandson he had. I have one sister who has 2 daughters, and I have 2 daughters along with my son. So there are 5 grandkids in total.  My dad was never much of a girls guy. He always got along with the boys more than the girls. Him and my son were very close. He has left the car to my son in his will. The rest of the grandkids got $4,000 each. The vehicle is valued at over $70,000.  My sister is LIVID, I am very unhappy as well. It\u2019s just blatantly unfair to his 4 other grandkids. I don\u2019t understand the legality of the situation because it was left to him but he is currently underage. The car is currently held at my moms house. I don\u2019t know how to force him to sell it, but I think that is what should happen and the money can be decided equally amongst the grandkids. The way it should be.  My son is very upset about this, he says grandpa left him the car so it\u2019s his car. I have money saved for his college, I am almost considering telling him that his college money will be divided up amongst his sisters and cousins if he refuses to sell the car.  AITA?",

        "selftext": "Hey all, I'm genuinely torn about this and need some clarity. Every year, our family has a reunion where different members host. This year, it's my younger sister's turn. She's been vegan for about 3 years and is quite passionate about it. We all respect her choices and make sure there are a good variety of vegan options whenever we have family gatherings. When she announced she'll be hosting, she also said that the entire menu would be vegan to align with her beliefs and that it's a chance for the family to try something different. Some family members were excited, but others, including many of the older folks, were pretty upset and felt like they were being forced into her lifestyle, even if just for one meal. I spoke to her privately and asked if she'd be open to including a few non-vegan dishes for those who aren't keen on a full vegan menu. She got quite defensive, saying this was her chance to showcase veganism and that for one meal, everyone can give it a go. I respect her beliefs, but I also think that forcing an entire family to adopt her choices, even if just for one meal, isn't fair. She's now upset with me for not being supportive and says I'm not respecting her choices. AITA? UPDATE:wow! lots of good thoughts! ,thought I would answer a couple questions here so they're not lost in the comments: 1. There is no set rota, the hosting goes to whoever wants to host most / hasn't hosted before, in this case she wanted to host2. We have managed to come to a compromise where people can bring their own food as long as it doesn't contain meat, which I think is fair.3. just for some more context, she works at a well known UK fast food place, so has no issues handling / preparing / serving meat, although I get that this can be different at home.",

        "selftext": "My husband has been working really hard the last two years to advance at his company and he finally got the promotion he's been after. I'm really, really proud of him. His parents are too and wanted to take us all out to dinner to celebrate. My husband absolutely loves prime rib and there's only one place in our area that serves it so he picked that restaurant. Thing is- I'm not fond of steak. I'll eat it but very rarely. I prefer chicken or fish. I looked up the menu before leaving and right now they have a limited menu. The place had only one fish entree and two chicken entrees, and none of them sounded good for various reasons. I suggested that he pick someplace else so everyone can eat. He refused citing that we rarely get to go to this place but go to other places in our area regularly which is true, but those places have lots of variety so everyone can eat. He suggested that I ask if they could prepare the fish or chicken without the marinades or sauces but I didn't want to be difficult for the kitchen staff. His next suggestion was that I order dessert while everyone else ate entrees and then when we were done, he would take me where I wanted so I could eat dinner while he and the kids ate dessert. So I opted to just not go because I didn't want to sit there not eating and not having a good time while everyone else was. My husband asked me to go so he could celebrate with the people most important to him. I told him no again and that he needed to get going before he was late. He did go but came back a little over an hour later with the kids and they all had to go boxes. He said he couldn't think of what to tell the kids about why I didn't go when they kept asking without lying or making me sound bad so he just got an order for them to go and let the kids spend some time with their grandparents talking in the parking lot. I told him he should had stayed but he said that I put him in a bad spot with the kids and that I knew he wanted everyone there and that I should've just gotten over my picky eating for one night. I maintain if he really wanted us to all eat dinner as a family then he should've picked a restaurant with a more accomodating menu. AITA? Update: Some of these comments were pretty harsh but a kick in the pants. I've apologized profusely to my husband and I am going to take him to that restaurant this weekend and buy him some camping gear he's been eying as a start to making it up to him and changing course.",

        "selftext": "My son just graduated high-school and we were paying so he could go on a road trip with his friends. He was suppose to go Wednesday , my wife\u2019s mother and father got in a car accident. They live in another state so we had to drive about 4 hours. My wife was a wreck and wasn\u2019t in the position to drive since we her dad was critical. He pulled through luckily.  We have two other kids 11 and 7. We can\u2019t leave them at home alone and we couldn\u2019t find a sitter to watch them on such short notice, we even tried our neighbors but he couldn\u2019t do it. So that left our 18 year old. He was pissed to put it mildly but did it. I told him we would make it up to him, and if he could ask if his friend could move it back a week. They couldn\u2019t sadly.  We were gone for two days, he pulled though. My wife stayed and I headed back, I payed him for watching the kids and went to talk to him about getting him on the trip. It was suppose to be two weeks and they should just be a state over. He blows up about ruining his trip and there is no point going even though it should still 12 days of the trip. He called up a jerk and lock himself in his room.  I need another opinion since this was emergency and he doesn\u2019t seem to care his grandparents almost passed.  Edit: Well he called his mom, let\u2019s say it didn\u2019t end well,  he did say basically said the same thing he said to me, wife had a breakdown on the phone with him, she sent him the injuries and pictures of grandpa/grandma. He finally came out of his room and told me he isn\u2019t going to go on the trip and the plan tickets aren\u2019t needed.  Talked to my wife, never heard her that mad. Son confirmed what happened, he started yelling at her the moment the call started and she lost her shit when he called her selfish. On good news grandpa has some feeling back in his legs which was a huge concern  For people saying we didn\u2019t have emergency plan we do, first my closest friend- vacation, main babysitter- not available, backup babysitter- not available, last resort grandparents- hospital.  We tried to find someone that why we even asked our neighbor which I have a good relationship with. This will be my last update, had a conversation with my son about everything. Mom and him will have a conversation when she is calms down. His friends are not a state over, they are about two down at this point and going to Mexico. They are probably will get to the boarder tonight, they were suppose to be going to California . He had his passport and everything ready. This is a fucking mess. I haven\u2019t informed my wife yet and will wait until she is calmer. I\u2019ll leave off with I hope none of you ever have to deal with a situation like this and please remember your parents are human",

        "selftext": "I (54M) have two children (23F and 21M) with my wife (52F). When the kids were young, my parents set up education funds for both of them, which was very generous of them. My wife and I always expected our kids to attend college and then graduate school, as we have done. I have a PhD, my wife has a master's. Because of this, we decided not to use the funds for our kids' undergrad degrees and did not tell them about the money. My daughter has always been more into the liberal arts, while my son is more of a STEM guy. My wife and I worried about her ability to find a job, but she insisted on studying music and film in college. She was accepted to some top schools and chose to attend a rather expensive one, but she had scholarships to cover almost all of her tuition. Everything else, plus living expenses, was her responsibility. She lived in a very small apartment shared with friends in a not-so-nice area far from campus, but she was fine and learned how to budget effectively. After graduating, she luckily found a job that doesn't pay extremely well but she enjoys, and scrapped the idea of grad school. My son decided to do engineering, and he also expressed that he had no interest in grad school. My wife and I were disappointed, but accepted it since at this point he is already all set up with a very good job when he completes school. Since he did not receive as many scholarships as his sister, we decided to use his education fund to cover his tuition and living expenses. He was able to get a large and nice apartment of his own close to the school, which is important since his classes are so demanding and he needs a comfortable space to work. My daughter was confused and asked how he could afford this, and he told her about the education fund. She called us and asked why she didn't have one, and we told her she did, we just didn't use it because we hoped she would attend grad school. She seemed hurt by this and asked if there was any way she could have the money now. We explained that there would be a fee to simply withdraw the money for non-education uses, and if we chose to do that it would belong to her grandparents so they could put it towards their own use. She's been quiet and short when answering our texts, and hasn't answered our calls at all since then. I know that it seems unfair to her, but it's not really her money in the first place and she's no longer in college. Plus, her brother only received it for educational purposes and it wouldn't be right for her to just have it to spend now. AITA? UPDATE: I understand the consensus is that my wife and I are the AH. I texted my daughter to ask if she wanted us to withdraw the money for her/what she wanted to do. This was her response: I don't care. Maybe they can transfer it to [other grandkid who is 5] if the fee is seriously too much. Idk about grad school I haven't thought about it much recently. If I do apply it wouldn't be for another couple years and I hadn't been counting on having any financial help in the first place so it really doesn't even matter. Thanks for asking tho. UPDATE 2: My wife and I are discussing our daughter's response and our next actions to resolve this situation. For context, my wife has always had a strained relationship with my daughter and did not approve of many of her life choices. She believes we should take our daughter's words at face value and assume she no longer wants the money. From some of the responses here, I fear that my daughter's response was out of resentment and I suggested taking out as much money as her brother was given so at least they received the same amount. She could use it responsibly towards rent, groceries, transportation, etc. or in some other way to further her career, so it would still be for educational purposes in a sense. My wife is standing firm in her opinion, and we will continue talking it through tomorrow.  Many have asked about where my parents stand on this. At this point, they are not mentally aware enough to really participate in the discussion. They did know about our grad school stipulation and thought it was fine. They also knew that we took out some money for our son once we were certain he was not pursuing an advanced degree, and were fine with that as well. They said it was our decision as parents what to do with our daughter's fund, and they would support whatever we decided for her. It wouldn't be useful to ask them what to do with it now, but I have always said that whatever is unused will go back to their care. I have tried to call my daughter with no luck, which is why I sent the text. Despite what many have said here, I hope this does not end our relationship. ",

I have a crush on her although she isn't exactly my type. Lately I feel like I've been getting vibes that she likes me back. Last week I won a raffle and have 2 tickets to see a famous singer perform next month in a nearby city. She also happens to like this singer so I asked her if she wanted to go with me as a date. I said I can book us a hotel room and we can spend the night together. She said she'd love to go, but only as friends. She says she's alright with us splitting a hotel room as long as it has two beds. She told me she doesn't feel ready to date anyone at the moment, and she doesn't do flings either, so unfortunately we can only be platonic friends. I said I'll think about it. I was quite hurt because honestly I don't have much experience with rejection, and I was annoyed that she turned me down.  Today, i asked my female coworker to go with me to the concert as a date. She immediately said yes and seemed quite excited about it although she admitted that she never listened to any of their songs. Still, I'm taking her out for drinks on Friday. But just now, the friend who I asked originally asked if we were still on for the concert. I told her honestly that I already asked another woman, and she seemed disappointed but dropped the subject. When I told my sister about what happened, she said I'm being really douchy. She says her friend is a huge fan of the singer and I should take her instead of my coworker who doesn't even like the band but only wants to go because she likes me. I said she can't understand because she's not a dude. Because let's me honest, if I had the choice between going out with a girl who only wants to be my friend versus a girl who is super into me and wants to take things to the next level, then obviously I'm taking the second one. AITA for just being honest about what I want? **EDIT**: Because a lot of the hang up is over the hotel room thing: YES I would have been fine if the first girl agreed to go with me as a date, but wanted separate hotel beds/rooms. Nowhere do I even say that we have to share a bed... But the part where she says she\u2019s not ready to date anyone essentially means she is not interested in me. She likely said she\u2019ll go with me as friends just to be nice and not hurt my feelings. So why would I make the experience awkward for the both of us when I could bring along someone who actually is interested in dating me? **EDIT OVER**",

It will be around 100-150 people total. My husband and I are paying for this all ourselves, as well as my grandma who said she doesn't care one way or the other on this issue. She just loves weddings. We have a lot of kids in our family so we decided against making it child-free but we did decide to make it dry. So there will be no alcohol of any kind at our wedding. Honestly, this doesn't have anything to do with there being kids there but due to the fact that my fianc\u00e9 and I don't drink. Nothing against people who do, it's just not for us and we don't want to. On top of that, we only really drink water. We rarely, if ever, drink soda so most of the time it's only water with the occasional juice and milk. We don't even drink coffee.  So obviously the food (which is a part my grandma is not paying for) is going to be expensive for that many people. We are having our wedding catered so everyone will have a good choice of food to choose from but to drink only water will be provided. We don't want to have to pay for alcohol or soda, it is just an large added expense when we can just do filtered water for a MUCH cheaper cost. Well, when family and friends found out being got angry. Some didn't really care but some are really upset about it. Saying that I can just have an open bar so I don't have to pay for drinks (we could, but still have to pay for the bartender and we just really don't want to bother with alcohol there). Or we should at least have soda because how can we expect everyone to drink ONLY water? The kids will be upset. The wedding will be boring. That this is not how weddings work. Etc. So AITA? I didn't think this would be a problem! It's only water. I mean, don't most people drink water everyday anyway? Should we pay the extra to have soda to make the family happy?",

        "selftext": "My 9yo son needed hip bone osteoma surgery and his mom and I scheduled it before his three week winter break. My ex and I share 50/50 but I get him on winter breaks so she could take him our of state to see her family in the summer. The day before the surgery she asked me if Ry could stay at her place to recover from the surgery. I asked her why and all she said was that she just wanted to be there. I said no. Ry has never had surgery and it's a big deal for him. I don't want him to think that the first thing you when you face something scary is run to your mom and not your dad. I told her I was quite insulted by her request. Plus he was going to need help getting dressed, undressed and bathed for the first couple of days and I highly doubt that he'd be comfortable having his mom do that. She said her husband could do that. I told her no. He's having the surgery and I'm taking him to my house when he's released. I don't care if she's in the operating room.  She then asked if she could see him at my place and I said no. The agreement is that we have scheduled FaceTime with him when he's at the other parent's house. I don't want my ex wife in my home anymore than she wants me in hers. If the shoe was on the other foot then I'd understand whether I liked it or not.  I held firm and things have been tense between us ever since. Personally I don't care because I'm not apologizing for not giving her what she wanted. Edit: No, my son doesn't get to decide who he gets to stay with and when and for how long. That's why there are custody agreements.",

        "selftext": "Throwaway because some of this made local news and I don't want it connecting back to me. I work in a place where we are not allowed to have personal electronics on us at all. No phones, no smart watches, no pagers. I've been working here for about 6 months so my wife knows this and understands that she should not try to contact me by my cell at work. Phones are dropped off in our lockers and I typically have mine on Do Not Disturb. Before this incident, my phone has never gone off in the locker before. Recently there was a pretty big fire at a secondary worksite that I do work at occasionally but that day I was working at the main building. Local news covered the fire before I found out about it because again no electronics, plus the work we do isolates us a bit so news travels pretty slowly. There were a few casualties, a lot of seriously injured folk.  My wife had been watching the news from home and started freaking out, I guess. She called me 20 freaking times, which (and I did not know this was possible) overrode my DND and my phone was ringing for a while in my locker. In the middle of my shift, I got called into my managers office and was chewed out (and written up) for my phone making so much noise. They told me to go take care of whatever it was making my phone go off before I went back to work. I won't lie...when I saw those 20 missed calls from my wife I was seriously pissed off. Like I said, she knows not to try to contact me directly and a citation hurt my chances of getting a raise or promotion. I called her back and she was sobbing and asking me if I was okay. I said of course I was okay and asked what the f*ck was wrong with her to call me so many times. She was still crying and started talking about the fire. After that I started half-yelling at her about all the reasons it was dumb of her to call me. When I got home she was super upset with me. I apologized for yelling but she refused to talk. She's been very chilly the past few days and sleeping in our daughter's room. I know it was not the best decision to yell at her but I still think my anger justified . 1) she knows I don't work in the secondary worksite very often. 2) she knows that I can't be contacted directly and she could have just called the office. 3) 20 calls is absolutely *insane*.

        "selftext": "So I know from experience that Reddit isn't the most understanding towards parents of young kids but I really just want a third party opinion because this situation is driving me crazy and my family are saying I need to get over it I (F30's) live with my partner and our two kids, ages 7 and 3. My older sister Ava (also F30's) and her husband recently purchased a house in the local area. It's a super nice place with a big yard and as you can probably guess from the title, a swimming pool. Ava recently hosted a barbecue at her place. It wasn't a huge event, she invited me, our parents and our other siblings. She mentioned letting the kids play in the pool so I only assumed my kids would get to be included We are potty training although my youngest is still in diapers at the moment. At the barbecue, I was getting my youngest ready for the pool by changing him into a swim diaper. Ava pulled me aside and told me she doesn't think it's hygienic for my youngest to play in the pool, since swim diapers don't hold pee and she asked that he doesn't swim in the pool with the other kids playing in it I didn't think this was fair and told Ava that lots of people, adults and kids, pee in the pool and it would be no different at a public pool so what's the problem? She was being really condescending and wouldn't listen to me at all and said that he can play in the pool when he's toilet trained, and said it's not fair on the other kids. At this point my son was crying because he wanted to swim in the pool and I told Ava she was being cold but it's her house and her pool so do what you want. Ava accused me of trying to guilt trip her and told me to just drop it. I was getting upset myself at this point and i told our parents and other siblings about what Ava did. They told me it's not a big deal and that it's not worth arguing with her over and try not to let it bother me. I wasn't happy with this because this essentially means they're siding with her and downplaying how she treated me and my son.  I left the barbecue early with my family because we didn't feel welcome after that. The next day Ava messaged me a whole paragraphs and said that she's sorry that I'm upset and that she wasn't trying to exclude my son for the sake of it. It was a super non-apology and I told her I don't want to hear it and that she's damaged her relationship with her nephew and shes not the one who had to deal with him being upset.  Ava snapped at me out of nowhere and said I'm being dramatic. I told her to grow up and said that I have a very valid reason to be mad, and she needs to stop acting like a teenager.  Ava showed these messages to everyone and everythings just a bit up in the air. I feel like I'm right here but the rest of my family doesn't seem to agree.",

        "selftext": "So, my daughter was born over 3 months early. She's doing ok but she still have periods where she Bradly desats (braddies) where she stops breathing, oxygen saturation drops in her body and goes bright blue. She does this at least once a day and because of this, she is still in the NICU with no current projection for when she's coming home. The only thing I can do to help her is to give her cuddles and provide her milk, which means expressing for 20 minutes minimum on each boob every 2 to 3 hours, including over night.  I have also had problems with flees in my home (they've been awful for everyone in my area this year), so I've torn up all carpets and thrown away my sofa and mattress, so I'm currently sleeping on the floor on a blow up mattress with my fianc\u00e9. This means that any noise that I make, no matter how much I try to minimise it, carries downstairs to my neighbour. I express milk over night, once at 11:30pm, 1am and then at 6:30am. My neighbour downstairs knocked on my door this morning and complained about my 1am alarm waking him up. I apologised and told him that I can't turn that specific alarm off because it's the expression that impacts my milk flow and doing that expression will prompt me to produce more milk over the day. I'm already under enough stress that my milk flow has already been impacted ( I was producing around 100ml and I'm down to 50 to 70 ml). I need the alarms because I cannot miss my expressions, I already feel guilty enough that I'm not producing as much as I was.  I explained all this to him and he still said that it wakes him up and that he can't sleep after it wakes him up. I again apologised and said to him that I can set my alarm between 1am and 3:30am, and he can choose from between those times. He said I should just turn the alarm off and I responded that I can't, because I can't afford to sleep through my expressions times. He then said that I should express after 5am, which isn't possible because the hormones that help produce more milk are at their peak at between 1am and 4am.  He complained about it waking him up again and I angrily responded that My daughter is premature, she needs my milk and I will do everything to make sure she's got as much as she needs, including waking you up at 1am because I need to express!  She is my priority, not your sleep. I closed the door in his face.  I just spoke to one of my friends and she's telling me that I'm the asshole because my daughter is eating every 3 hours and I'm making just enough milk every time for at least one meal for her, so it won't hurt to not express the 1am expression but it honestly IS the most important expression for milk production. So Reddit, AITA for not stopping expressing at 1am even though I know it wakes up my neighbour? ETA: many people have suggested I put the phone on vibrate, which would be a fantastic solution if it wasn't for the fact that I have slept straight through having injections or having a cannula put in (I was awoken long enough to give permission to have it put in). I'm open to solutions, but putting my phone on vibrate isn't going to work. Eta2: I gave him noise cancelling earplugs and explained the situation when I first came home from the hospital. We also pulled up the carpets 4 days before I went into labour, so it's not something that we could control, we have to leave the flea solution to work for 2 weeks and the firm has already been booked to have new flooring put in after that 2 weeks. Eta3: I've been asked to add this because it gives context to my neighbour's view regarding noise.He apparently needs absolute silence, noise or vibration doesn't seem to matter. He made a noise complaint when I moved in because I flushed my toilet at night and then again when my cat jumped down from her cat tree to get food or water at night. I've learned every squeaky floorboard in my home because if I stand on one and the squeak wakes him up, he'll scream and bang on the ceiling. This will be my last edit, I am no longer going to be reading comments here or via pm as there has been some pretty heinous messages sent to me. I get it Reddit I'm the asshole but to have people tell me my daughter should stop breathing and die is unacceptable and I have reported that specific message and blocked the user. This is quite enough internet for a while.",

He came home and was lashing out on everybody. Calling us selfish and unfeeling. I tried to explain that the kids were busy but he told me to get the f out with that bull because my older son could've skipped the hangout and watched his brother and, my daughter could've watched her brother while studying instead of locking herself in her room. He scolded me as well but I told him I couldn't leave lunch with my brother since he was visiting town and this was my only chance to meet his girlfriend. He yelled some more than told us that he was canceling the family holiday trip for christmas this year. The two older kids were upset and said it was unfair. I called him unreasonable to cancel the trip and punish the kids (and possibly me) like that. he refused to discuss it later. Now me and the kids aren't speaking to him and he's saying good riddance *edit My husband was supposed to watch our son at the time. That's why I went to see my brother at the restaurant. The kids aren't used to watching their brother when neither parent is home.* *update My husband just told us that he'll be spending christmas with his family saying he needs to be around his dad anyway. the kids said they will just go to their dad since they and my husband are still not talking. neither of the kids are happy with how things turned out. so I feel like things have gotten out of hand and the problem got bigger. He's now choosing to basically abandon us on christmas and also keep our son away from me and his siblings.*",

Our daughter has always been a little socially awkward to the point that we've had her tested since we suspected her of being on the spectrum. Turns out she isn't on the spectrum; she's just a natural introvert. However, this year in school we were thrilled when our daughter made a new friend her age since that is an area in which she struggles. Long story short she recently invited her new friend over (with our aproval) to have dinner at our house and then spend the night. So, my daughter's friend came over. My husband is usually the cook in the family and this night was no exception; he made us all a really nice meal. During the course of said meal I asked my daughter's friend; Are you enjoying the food? She responded Yes! [Your husband] is a great cook! No wonder you've ended up a bigger woman. The room got quiet for several moments. My husband tried to laugh it off and change the subject but I wasn't having it. The girl had just leveled a completely uncalled-for insult at me. My daughter's friend seemed to realize that she'd messed up but she didn't say anything else. We finished an awkward dinner in mostly silence and my daughter's friend did stay the night. This was a couple of months ago. Recently my daughter asked if she could have her friend back over and I told her Sure; if she's going to apologize to me. When our daughter asked what I meant I reminded her of what she'd said. My daughter responded that it was over and she didn't want to bring it up again. She then went to her father and asked. He said sure but she then told him what I'd said. He came to me and said: [Daughter's friend]  just felt awkward and tried to make a joke. It didn't land. For the sake of our daughter can't you just let it go? Yes, I could, but the thing is that I just want an apology from the girl. I need to see that she understands how rude she was before I can get on board with her and myy daughter hanging out. My husband says that I am being weird for insisting on an apology from a 14 year-old, especially since that girl is such a good friend of our daughter. I think it's weird that I'm still waiting for an apology from that same girl. Seriously. That's all I need. I just need to know that any friend of my daughter is willing to own up to her screw ups.",

My husband and I are more than happy to have them stay for few weeks til they get this resolved. However, Yesterday at 7pm, I was in the kitchen when my husband rushed in and said that he saw both my sister and her husband walk out of the bathroom. They'd most likely taken a shower together. My husband said that it irked him and I agreed that what they did was somewhat inappropriate. He asked me to speak to my sister on the matter and I did. She got defensive asking how this is affecting me or my husband in any way. I told her that it made my husband feel uncomfortable and would rather that they just take their showers seperately. She started ranting about being overwhelmed by their son's health problems and not having some alone time together as a married couple and found this activity as a bonding time to spend together. I apologized for how she felt but requested that she just do as asked. She got mad at me and said that I was being inconsiderate and she didn't understand my husband's hangup on what she and her husband do. We started arguing and she stormed off to the guests room where my nephew and BIL are. She's not speaking to me but my husband said I did the right thing by speaking to her and setting this boundary. AITA? Am I (and my husband) overreacted to this? Some infos: 1. My husband did not mention hearing anything, just that he saw them get out of the bathroom. And yes they were clothed. 2. It's the only bathroom in the house. 3. They spent apprximately 10+ in the shower according to my husband. EDIT* I'm gonna bring my husband to look at the responses and help answer some questions down here, okay? Just give me a few minutes. EDIT* I'm sorry I can't respond to every single comment but my husband says he's uncomfortable and doesn't want to expand on the situation.",

        "selftext": "My (34m) sister gave birth 2 months ago. She brought the baby to mine and my wife's (23f) wedding. She breastfeeds whenever she goes. We visit her house? She'll breastfeed in front of us. Visiting our parents? She'll breastfeed. Going out in a public setting? She'll sit on a bench on the park and breastfeed. Go out to a restaurant? She breastfeeds. Every where. I've never spoken on it because I know she'll get mad and offended but when she did that on my wedding I lost my cool. During the reception dinner she just did it again. I kindly approached her and asked her why she didn't bring formula or at least bump milk out and put it in the bottle so she wouldn't have to do all this at that moment. She said because I don't have to. I feel comfortable breastfeeding. Getting milk out on my own is more painful I said she could just make this sacrifice and compromise for one day instead of doing this in front of 250 guests on my wedding. She then said she can't do much about it now, because the baby has to have her milk. I told her she should be more thoughtful of that then instead of completely embarrassing herself and us by doing this. I told my wife what the deal was and she said I'm an AH and should immediately apologise to my sister. My parents also sided with my sister and now pretty much everyone thinks I'm an AH since I'm the only person who had a problem with it. The only reason I decided to call her out is because I considered it a bad etiquette and tacky to do that at a formal event and that she could just find another solution for that night. AITA?",

        "selftext": "I <30M> have a beautiful wife who loves to serve others. We bought a home down the street from my family. I have a sweet sister <17>Who likes to crash at our house with her friends.  My wife normally is pretty easy going until recently. My sisters friends have been leaving messes. Mostly towels on the floor after using our pool. My wife got upset picking up after them every day.  I have asked my sister to make sure the house is clean after they leave and it has been better. My wife also complained that some of her perfumes/Clothes personal items have gone missing.My sister said it\u2019s not her. I believe my sister. I just don\u2019t see her doing that. I told my wife and we agreed to just replace them. Last week my wife made a couple of pans of cinnamon rolls from scratch. One pan was for us, the second pan was for a co-workers family who is experiencing a tragedy.  My wife went to the gym. I went to work and my sister and her friends came by. The one pan wasn\u2019t enough for her and her friends.They wanted the second pan of cinnamon rolls and my sister texted my wife asking if they could eat them. My wife said no. They ate them anyways. My wife upset went and bought new locks. When I came home my wife handed me a new key and told me that she didn\u2019t want anyone else to have a key to our house. I tried to calm her down and tell her that I would just go replace the eaten cinnamon rolls with store bought ones. My wife decided this was her hill to die on and said no my sister lost the privilege to come when we are not home. Replacing stolen items wasn\u2019t \u201cgood enough\u201d anymore. My mom called and asked if my sister could use the pool as a back to school party? I was under the impression my mom would be there. I said yes, my mom was at work and our schedules clashed. The easiest solution was for me To change the locks back so they could come into the house. My mom didn\u2019t come with my sister. When my wife got home after the party. It was a mess. She sent me photos. She called me the A for changing the locks without talking to her about it. (Keep in mind she did too.) then told me I broke her trust. She wasn\u2019t safe in her home because she keeps getting robbed and I refuse to put an end to it. (I did talk to my sister). Then my wife let me know she was staying with a friend for awhile.  Am I the A here? I feel like I have tried to right any wrongs that have happened. Between my wife and my sister. Update* sorry I haven\u2019t been able to reply the past couple of hours. I have been busy. I talked to my mom again and let her know my sister isn\u2019t allowed over without me home.  I asked a friends wife who is a maid to come deep clean our home. So if/when my wife comes home it\u2019s clean. The last thing is my mom asked me to help cover my sisters cheer. She is on track for a scholarship. I told my mom I would pay half of my wife\u2019s things were returned. If not the money was going to replace the stolen items. Also my sister was invited to home coming. She wanted me to buy a dress. I told her no for not following our home rules and the money I saved for the dress is going to pay for the maid. I did replace the locks again. I also am planning a romantic dinner I will make and clean up. I heard a lot about the cinnamon rolls. Someone on here gave me the idea to make them. I am for a dessert. Update: my sister and my mom left a few mins ago. My sister had a bag of my wife\u2019s things. More than I thought was gone. Most items are in poor shape. The big thing is she had my wife\u2019s grandmothers ring I thought was in the safe. I had no idea it was gone. My sister said that she found it on my wife\u2019s night stand during the party. She forgot she had it on when she left our home. The ring isn\u2019t valuable it\u2019s just sentimental. I told my mom who the ring belonged to. My mom lost it. My sister is now grounded. Last update tonight, my wife is coming home. I am staying at a friends house. Until we can work some of this out. I already stated it but I did put the locks back on my wife bought. My family doesn\u2019t have that key. Early morning update, My mom called my wife last night and asked what my sister can do to fix/ replace the damaged items.My wife said \u201chave her meet me every morning at 5 am.\u201d I decided to tag along and see what my wife had planned. Trying to support her in whatever punishment she decides to do. You know the cinnamon rolls. My wife\u2019s co-works 4 yr old is in the final stages of cancer. My wife\u2019s plan is for my sister and her to prepare breakfast, get their other kids up and ready for the day. Start laundry, basic clean up. So her co-worker and his wife can spend as much time as he can with the sick child before work. My sister was silent the whole time coming back home.I can tell it really hit her that her life isn\u2019t as hard. Even being grounded. Last and final post, my wife has given me a second chance as long as I follow her list of rules.1) for awhile no family at our home2) no family borrowing our things. 3)no one is allowed a key4)I help with the chores around the house. Including cooking meals.5) last My wife is ok with me seeing my sister but asked that we all go to counseling to understand why my sister is targeting her. My wife said all of this has been really hard and she doesn\u2019t want to cause more issues but she just doesn\u2019t trust my sister and can\u2019t have her using out things.",

I then, as a joke, said at least she'll still be tight down there. My GF looked confused and then said that was a weird comment to make about her friend. I then said it is a very normal joke to make and she disagreed. TLDR there was some back and forth, i asked her to drop it and she kept trying to talk about it. I said to her youre so insecure and she then goes does it make you feel good to call me that? so then I got really frustrated, got up, and walked out of the restaurant and drove home. She called me several times (I drove both of us there) but I was so frustrated and just wanted to get home so I turned my phone off. She showed up at our apartment 30min later and was really pissed called me an asshole and over reacted, and that she waited in the cold for 20 min for an uber.

        "selftext": "My husband (39) and I have been married for 5 years. We have two children of our own, both girls, aged 5 and 2. I also have a son (10) from a previous marriage, but I was widowed. My husband's ex is barely involved in stepson's life at all. They got divorced when stepson was 2, and his ex wanted a fresh start so my husband did the decent selfless thing and had complete custody of their son, even though he'd wanted shared custody. I got a bonus at work and I really want to go on vacation with just MY family JUST once. We've been on family vacations all together lots of times. But just once I want to spend MY money going on vacation where I'm not looking after someone else's kid. I want stepson to stay with his mom while we go on vacation. My husband sees my point of view and is okay with it. I don't think I'm being at all unreasonable. My mom found out what I was planning and says I'm being a complete AH. These are the reasons she says I could be the AH: 1. My mom says that if stepson's mom isn't properly involved in his life, I should be even more involved in his life to compensate (I think this is a completely unfair expectation).2. She also says that I'm being a hypocrite taking my son, but I think that's totally different because my son DOESN'T HAVE ANOTHER PARENT. I'm all he's got. If stepson's mom won't take him just for once then obviously he'll come on vacation with us. But I don't think I'm the AH to ask if I can have a vacation with my own family just one time. It's not like I hate stepson or something, he's a nice kid, he's just not mine. Am I the AH? UPDATE: We definitely won't be going on vacation without stepson.\r  \r After a couple hours of replies, I decided to show this to my husband. We sat down and had a really long talk about it. He told me he's never been comfortable with my attitude to stepson, but didn't know how to say to me before.\r  \r  I don't want to be a bad person, I just never thought of stepchildren being yours. \rI don't think it would be easy for anyone to accept this level of criticism, but all your replies have shown me I have a LOT of work to do. As many of you suggested (and so did my husband) I intend to see a therapist to help me with that.\r As I said, I don't hate stepson in any way, I have never been deliberately cruel to him, I've just always thought of him as my husband's child. But I realize my mindset needs to change. \rSo I'm going to start working on that. I want my family to be the best it can be, and I need to accept that it includes my stepson. I understand that now, and I'm going to start seeing a therapist to become a better person (we've also talked about maybe having family therapy too). I've also made up with my mom, and she is 100% behind the changes I want to make in my life.\r  \r  It wasn't easy to hear everything you said, but I understand that I needed to hear it.",

        "selftext": "This happened last year but since it still gets brought up during arguments every now and then and I just discovered this Subreddit I decided to check what you guys think. Me and my wife have two children (15F & 11M). My wife is a stay at home mom since the birth of our second child. I (46M) work full time and earn a six figure salary. My job is highly stressful, requires me to travel a lot and mostly sleep in hotels. I only get to come home to my family on every second weekend, on average. Despite working a lot, I am glad to do it so that my family can live a comfortable life. Last year, I decided to buy my wife a Roomba for Christmas. My wife tends to be the one who vacuums the house so I presumed that she would like this present as it would free her of this chore. As she unpacked the present, she was heavily offended and did not hesitate to show it, which made the whole situation quite uncomfortable as my parents and other members of the family were also present. She argued that 'this should not be a present directed at her but at the whole family, as it is the entire family\u2019s responsibility to clean up the house'. Since I work and am the sole source of income in the family and she is a stay at home mother, I think it is apparent that she should take on responsibilities such as taking care of the kids and maintaining the house. The gift was intended to somewhat relieve her of this burden. I, personally, would have loved to have received a Christmas gift that would have somehow made it possible for me to spend less time working. As cheesy as it sounds, I think that time is one of the most precious gifts and that Roomba would have definitely bought some time for her - time that she could use to do whatever she pleased instead of vacuuming.  Unfortunately, one year later, this still often gets brought up during arguments, often coupled with her crying. So, AITA in this situation? EDIT: I should also add that I would have never gifted my wife a vacuum cleaner or anything along these lines. I saw the Roomba as a robot that would fully take over this task which is why I thought it was a good idea. EDIT #2: I asked her numerous times before Christmas last year what she would have liked to receive and she repeatedly told me that she does not want anything. I was left to guess and chose the most practical gift that I was certain she could be able to make use of.",

She\u2019s an author, she write and self published romance and erotica stories and novels and while not rich, she\u2019s able to make a living out of it.

        "selftext": " My wife is a grade A+ picky eater. It's bothersome to a certain degree but on holidays basically the shitshow begins. She'd refuse to eat certain meals and mom would take it personally...which results in a series of arguments between them. As a compromise this year, My wife offered to bring her own food to thanksgiving dinner. I was stunned I asked if she thought this through and she looked at me confused. I told her about how weird it'd be for her to bring her own food especially when she woudln't be sharing it with anybody else, and told her to think about how mom will react. She'd get very offended and upset. My wife said that it's not her problem and that she was just trying to make it work by bringing her own meal. I told her again that mom might not like nor even allow this. She blew up at me asking if I want her to either eat food she doesn't like or go hungry. I suggested she give my mom's food a chance but she said it wasn't about my mom's cooking, she just doesn't like certain foods. We had an argument and I ended up telling she could stay home this thanksgiving and have whatever meal she likes. She got quiet then lashed out on me calling me insensitive and negative to say this to her. I repeatedly asked her to calm down but she couldn't stop ranting about how I was basically willing to exclude her from a major event. She started cold shouldering me about it while at the same time guilting me saying I'm treating her poorly after she offered the perfect compromise. Update: And so, my wife has decided to go spend thankgiving with her family (who by the way live HOURS away, so this means unnecesary travel expenses) instead and basically ditch me for a whole week. Y'all happy now? Though I appreciate some insightful comments on the situation. Some others?.....not so much especially with those assumptions claiming that my wife has allergies, SHE DOES NOT! Y'all get that from? But anyway. S'all good now I guess though I'm not too thrilled with her decision. I feel like she's doing it to spite me or get me to cave in.",

        "selftext": "My GF and I got take out from an Indian restaurant we like and order from usually when our budget allows us. This place is really the only good Indian place anywhere near us  but it is very pricey, and so we try to keep our order small (1 entree for me, 1 entree for her, and a side of naan bread that we share). The thing is, the side of bread isnt very much, and the entree just isnt the same without it. So it seriously annoys me when she eats the bread without dipping it in her curry. Its such a waste of the little bread that we get. I told her this before but says its not my concern how she eats her food. Except it is my concern because she is wasting a SHARED side. Whatever, I let it go each time.  This time she didnt order curry like she usually does, she got biryani (rice and meat) so I was happy that I would get the bread to myself. While we were eating, she reaches over for the bread and eats a piece on its own. I got annoyed and moved the bread away from her and told her she doesnt need the bread  since she isnt eating a curry and doesnt need bread whereas I am eating a curry so I do need bread, also that her entree comes with rice and she can eat that. She got offended and ended up threatening not to pay her share for the food next time. She also called me a greedy asshole and took her food and ate the rest in our bedroom. My friends are split, one of them says I'm in the right and it's too much carbs for one meal for her to have bread and rice, but the  other friend essentially also called me a greedy asshole. Its been hours and she's ignoring me. AITA?",

This concerns my oldest, I'll refer to her as 'Zara' We don't normally do big parties in our family after double digits (and 18th/21st), but Zara has been going through a bit of a difficult time so we decided to throw her a surprise party. This was yesterday. It was a big family party and Zara was enjoying it. Then the cake was brought out, I have a lot of young nieces and nephews so naturally they wanted to stand up with Zara, and she had no issue. When she went to blow out the candles, my 5 year old niece blew most of them out before her. Everyone laughed it off, my youngest actually put 23 candles on the cake and there were still a few lit, so I told Zara to blow those out. She did, but she looked angry and started crying. She then walked off. After that it got quite awkward and my sister (niece's mom) got upset/embarrassed, that her daughter is a kid and didn't mean to do it, and she didn't think Zara would act like this. We all calmed her down that it's not their fault. I talked to Zara and told her she was being a selfish brat and making a scene, she's 23 getting mad about birthday candles. She was still upset, and my other kids are telling me I wasn't being fair with Zara.",

        "selftext": "I (28M) am an only child. When I was 12 my parents divorced when my dad found out my mom cheated on him. This was devastating to my dad. My parents were best friends and started dating when they were 17. I played sports and my dad was my coach so I had a much closer relationship to him then my mom. I was suppose to spend one week at my moms then the next week at my dads. But I would usually just lock myself in my room at my moms. Usually my dad would drop me off and I would get on my bike and ride the couple miles back to his house. My mom would ask me things and I would literally pretend like she didn\u2019t exist. It got so bad that lawyers got involved thinking my dad was turning me against my mom. My dad encouraged me to spend time with my mom, but I couldn\u2019t. My mom tried putting us in therapy but I would just sit there till the time was up not saying a word to her. Eventually my mom broke down and let me just live with my dad.  I haven\u2019t spoken a word to my mom in 15 years. She would show up to my games alone. Sometimes I would ask my dad to tell her to leave. Sometimes I didn\u2019t even notice she was there. She would try talking to me after and I would walk right past her. I cut her whole family off besides a few of my cousins that were around my age. She showed up to my high school graduation and I asked a couple teachers to remove her and they did. She never dated anyone else to my knowledge and was still attempting to reconcile with my dad a few years before he passed. Calling it the \u201cbiggest mistake of her life\u201d and begging my dad to forgive her. When my dad passed a couple years ago she tried to show up to the funeral and I met her outside to ask her to leave. My fianc\u00e9 Rachel was with me when I did this and my mom cried upon learning we were engaged (Rachel introduced herself as my fianc\u00e9). Saying she couldn\u2019t believe I hated her still this many years later.  So last week I received a letter from my mom with a large check inside. In the letter she said she couldn\u2019t live knowing she wouldn\u2019t be invited to her only child\u2019s wedding. That her whole family is hurt that I cut them off. And that she had been keeping tabs on me all these years through my cousins updates out of respect for me, but couldn\u2019t handle not being at the wedding. I ripped the check up and sent it back to the return address. She shouldn\u2019t have even known my address as I keep her blocked on all social media. I called up my cousins who admitted that since I was 14 they have been providing my mom with updates on me. Prom pics, college updates, engagement photos and they sent her my address. I was so mad that I told them they wouldn\u2019t be invited to the wedding anymore because I don\u2019t want my mom getting access to it. Rachel is saying I\u2019m going too far now and uninviting my cousins along with freezing out my moms whole family because of her actions is an AH move. AITA? Edit: the cheating was with a teammates dad. This was highly embarrassing for me and caused me to have to move towns. Caused me to loose friends.",

        "selftext": "So here's the deal. I (19M) smoke weed all day, every day. It's just a normal  part of my routine and I don't see anything wrong with it, and this is not something that I want to be judged on. My mom is completely against me smoking weed, and she's always telling me to stop.  I believe that cannabis is nature's medicine and that society is  oppressive to those who use it. It has helped me in so many ways and it upsets me that it's still stigmatized. My mom told me a few days ago that my uncle and younger cousins (4 and 6 years old) would be over around 3PM yesterday, and asked me to not smoke on that day. She always gets upset if she sees me smoking, so I didn't do it while she was home.  She went to the grocery store in the morning and I figured it would be okay to  blaze up in the living room with the windows open before my cousins showed up. Well as it turns out, my uncle and two cousins showed up early and walked in right as I was in the middle of smoking a joint and lounging on the couch in my underwear. It was a really embarrassing moment, and I'm sure my small cousins were shocked to see me like that. To make matters worse, they saw me coughing in a haze of smoke as they walked in. My uncle was upset and he screamed at me for smoking in front of the children and being irresponsible. He told me that I needed to grow up and start thinking  about the consequences of my actions. I could tell that he was really disappointed in me, and the whole situation made me really frustrated.  I know this was not a good situation and I regret that my cousins had to see me like that. But here's the thing: I don't think I did anything wrong. My mom told me the wrong arrival time, so how was I supposed to know that my cousins would be coming over early? And I don't see what the big deal is about smoking weed in my own home, as long as I'm not bothering anyone. If I had been told the correct time, this would have been avoided. **TL;DR:  I smoked weed in my living room while my mom was at the grocery store and my uncle and young cousins showed up early. My mom gave me the wrong arrival time and I don't think I did anything wrong by smoking weed in my own home.**",

My son and husband always turn up their noses at tofu or any other meat alternatives - they say it's just weird that it's made to resemble real meat, so it's really the concept and not the taste. There are no allergies. My family and I often make two versions of dinner - one meat, one real, and twice the amount of pots and pans. There is an equal distribution of cleaning and cooking in this house, thankfully. My daughters had a fun prank idea of making two pots of spaghetti sauce, under the pretense that one was meat (they were both the soy ground beef). The goal here was to see if their brother and father actually hated the meat and to see if we could maybe save some dishes and time (in the future). Everyone loved dinner, both husband and son finished their plates. This was when my youngest couldn't hold it in anymore and told them. They both got VERY upset about being fed something other than what they were told. Reddit, AITA?",

        "selftext": "My son is a 20 month old toddler, my wife is a stay-at-home mom, I work six days a week and I'm usually gone for twelve hours a day. I always check in on my son remotely via our nursery cam app and he's always awake in the mornings around 8:00. He has a great sleep routine. Our wind down time starts at the same time every evening, we clean up toys, read a book, when I lay him down he's still awake, he falls asleep on his own and sleeps all night for at least twelve hours. It's usually after 9:00 before I have a chance to check the camera, this morning when I checked it was 9:12 and some mornings are closer to 10:00. Every time I look though, he's awake in the dark and standing in his crib just waiting. When I see this, I immediately turn on the brightest night light the camera has and speak to him through the camera app. I always tell him good morning and I love him and he usually laughs and says Dada. Then I leave the app and call my wife to wake her up. I usually have to call three to four times and when she finally answers, it's obvious that she just woke up and only because I called. I tell her that our son is awake waiting for her and that she needs to get up to start their day. This morning while on the phone, I asked her if she was going to get him after using the bathroom and she said no, she was going to the kitchen to prepare their breakfast and THEN she'd get him. I asked her to get him after the bathroom so he could go to the kitchen with her and she flipped out. She told me it pisses her off that I call EVERY morning to tell her how to be a mom and that she has a routine. I retorted with well, your routine sucks because he's been awake for an hour and you'd still be asleep if I hadn't called. I just bothers me that he has to wait so long. He needs a diaper change, he's probably thirsty, hungry and just wants to play. Am I wrong though? Do I need to stop? Please be completely honest with your answers. Thanks!  **EDIT #1**  I was banned from commenting within the first hour because I violated a rule in a comment and that's why I wasn't responding to anyone. I'm a fairly new Reddit user in terms of posting - I normally read a lot and that's all - and because of this, I had no clue that a temporary comment ban didn't affect my ability to edit the post. I would have edited the post much sooner had I known I was able to regardless of the comment ban. There are so many things that need to be addressed about this post and the most important one is about my wife. I love her more than anyone on Reddit thinks I do. She is an amazing woman and a wonderful mother. I absolutely DO NOT think she is an incompetent parent nor do I think she neglects my son. None of the information I provided was ever supposed to convey that negative message about her. My whole issue was: he's awake, he's been awake, why are you still asleep? - that's all, and she agreed she stays up too late plus has alarms set now. I showed my wife how this post EXPLODED and she COULD NOT believe the kind of attention it got. She is very much in love with me and does not agree that I am controlling nor does she believe that I am micromanaging her daily life. Also, because so many people believe that I intentionally left out the medical issues she has, I'll list them here: - postpartum depression- low vitamin B-12- chronic fatigue Now, let me explain why I didn't list them originally. Her low vitamin B-12 is not a deficiency, her level is just lower than what is considered best for her age; this is according to recent bloodwork that I recommended. The results state that any number between 100 pg/mL and 914 pg/mL is within normal range, and her level is 253 pg/mL. The doctor suggested sublingual B-12 1000mcg daily to raise the level a little, but stated that apart from that, she could not find a reason for the chronic fatigue. Because of these results, and especially after purchasing the supplements, in my mind, the B-12 is not a problem. Also, the bloodwork confirmed that everything else was normal. The postpartum depression is actively being monitored and treated by a professional. My wife literally goes to a psychiatrist, or psychologist (I can't remember their exact title) multiple times a year and we pay for medication every 30 days. She initially tried depression medication, followed the regimen religiously and not much changed for her. This was addressed in a following appointment and a new medication was prescribed. Her current medication is normally used to treat ADHD or narcolepsy and the doctor believed it would alleviate some of her tiredness and release more dopamine thus providing more energy in her daily life. This does seem to be true and she seems to be happy with the medicine. The chronic fatigue is a result of her own poor scheduling and personal health. She has agreed that she spends too much time sitting and using the phone. She naps when our son naps and has trouble falling asleep at a normal bedtime hour due to this daytime sleep. We always go to bed together and he's told me multiple times that she moved to the living room after I fell asleep because she couldn't sleep and was bored just lying there. Then, midnight or later comes, she's finally drowsy and decides to sleep. However, the overstimulation from social media and phone usage makes it difficult for her brain to reach REM sleep normally. So she falls asleep at 12:00, our son wakes up at 8:00, eight hours have passed and she still feels tired and not at all rested. I do know and have known about her condition. We have agreed to disagree about the cause of her sleeping problems. In her mind she has chronic fatigue because of insomnia and it's a vicious cycle. In my mind she stays up too late on the phone and doesn't get the sleep her body needs. Whether the internet thinks she is a bad mother, negligent, lazy or abusive is not important. I know and love the woman I married, I do feel comfortable leaving her with our kid and she does an amazing job with him. In a few comments I stated that she was lazy and didn't do much at home. I won't deny those statements, but in the moment I was still aggravated because the argument over the phone had just recently ended. I don't truly think she's lazy because I've seen what she can do; I just think she's unmotivated due to a lack of sleep and the same four walls every day. Finally, I am not spying on her or my son. We only have two cameras in this house and both are in our son's room. One camera provides a wide-angle view of the entire room and the other is positioned directly above his crib. The cameras serve no purpose during the day because I'd barely be able to hear background noise from another room even if I did try to listen in. My wife is an amazing woman and an amazing mother. My son is just so happy all the time, he's super smart, full of energy and extremely healthy. I will not be hiring a nanny or using a daycare. There is absolutely nothing wrong with what my wife does during the day, I just wish she'd start her day earlier for my little man. I want to say thank you to everyone who commented on this post and messaged me. My wife and I had a long, in-depth conversation last night after all of the attention this post received and I've shown her everything. There were tears, much more laughs and a lot of things to think about. I think the most important thing we learned is that so many people are quick to judge and that in itself is a very big problem.  **EDIT #2**  I need to make it clear that my wife does not have narcolepsy. She is not taking medicine for narcolepsy. I said that the medicine she takes now is USUALLY used to treat narcolepsy or ADHD. She also does not have ADHD. The second thing we learned is that people love to add details and change the story.",

        "selftext": "For the past week, my wife and I had been anticipating a baseball game for which we had purchased tickets. We like baseball, but we don't attend many games, so traveling into the city to see games is a rare treat. I know, though, that it would take time to drive there and find parking, due to traffic. Because the game started at 7 PM, and we live about 45 minutes from the stadium, I told her this morning that she needed to be ready to get in the car and go by 6 PM.  Well, my wife is an avid gamer, so she was engrossed in her latest video game when the clock struck 5:45 PM. She has struggled to plan in the past, and I get tired of reminding her that she needs to budget time to get ready. It's as if she has no concept of time at all, similar to a young child. Well, I was ready to go by 6 PM, and she was in the bathroom. I saw this as an opportunity to teach her personal responsibility, so I simply left the house without saying a word, got in the car, and started driving to the game. It took my wife a few minutes to figure out what I had done, but when she called me, she was absolutely furious. She said that it was a completely unacceptable move for me to leave without telling her and that she now had no way to get to the game without paying for parking. I told her that I got tired of constantly waiting for her and that she would plan better next time if she didn't want to get left behind. I also reminded her that I had told her that morning when I expected her to be ready to leave. Absolutely none of this seemed to matter, though, and she rudely hung up on me after yelling out more insults. Frankly, I think it's completely insane that a grown woman is unable to budget her time, and I'm starting to suspect that she is doing this on purpose because she's a narcissist who expects me to accommodate her. After all, she's not a dumb woman. She has a science degree. Well, she never showed up to the stadium, and I didn't hear from her the whole game, but when I got home, there was a note on the door. She told me that I wasn't welcome in the bedroom and that I should sleep on the couch. I can't believe she wants to be this much of a pill. If I had waited for her, I would have missed the first pitch. I made my expectations clear, and she couldn't be bothered to meet them. I feel like she should be apologizing to me. AITA?",

        "selftext": "throwaway for privacy.  My wife (23) and I (27) are expexting. She's due this month and things have been bit intense recently with her being extra hormonal. We live in different state then my family. My wife and I couldn't visit for Christmas. my parents were calling to continue complaining about us not spending Christmas with them and demanded I make it up for them. I said I was open for any suggestions they had and they suggested they come stay with us for a week once the baby is born. That way they could spend time with us and the baby as well. I thought why not that seemed to be a pretty good suggestion since it's been months since we've seen each others so I told them to go ahead and made the invitation Official. This morning my wife was talking about her plans once the baby is here and that's when I remembered my conversation with my parents. I immediately told her that I agreed to let them over for a week once the baby is born to make up for the holiday we missed with them. She first looked shocked then freaked out at me saying I shouldn't have invited them just like that without talking to her first. I asked why not since she loves them and loves being around them but she explained that my family can be a lot of work and having them as guests while caretaking for a newborn is the last thing she wanted. I told her it was no big deal besides that we could use help if she thought about this way but she lashed out on me about how the first few days of the baby's life is essential time for bonding and being intimate and I just took that away from her by inviting my parents and invading her space. I argued that she was being melodramatic right then because my family are decent people and I'm pretty sure they'll make this experience a lot more warmer but she still disagreed and said if my family were decent then they wouldn't have accepted my invitation but I clarified to her that I did NOT invitem and this was in fact a suggested made by them and I just agreed AFTER they complained about me missing spending the holidays with them. She went off on me demanding I call them and cancel everything I planned with them but I thought that was unacceptable since she gave not a good-enough reason for me to do that and besides my parents can help but she still denied that being true. She's gone radio silence for the rest of the day and is acting like my family are somehow making her uncomfortable though they're not the judgemental or intrusive type and are just about spending time with each others. AITA? Hold on! #Edit few things so there's no misunderstanding here. Alright? First of all my wife doesn't normally have an issue with my family being around, they all get along pretty good. and second of all which is an important info my wife and I talked about having her directly speak to them about why she would rather postpone their visit so we could clear the air but she refused and said she doesn't want to ruin her relationship with them and asked me to do it (tell them not to come) but since my family are upset with me then me telling them not to come might be taken in an offensive way, you know what I'm saying? so it really feels like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place. also, to all the people saying that my wife shouldn't be hosting guests. I don't recall mentioning this nor expecting her to do anything for the family. matter of fact I really thought we could maybe use their help especially my mom.",

        "selftext": " My husband, Mike (37) is the eldest in his family. He's pretty close with his sister Beth, (28) and they spend almost all week together. Beth had issues with her father growing up. She went no contact with him after he took her first car and damaged it. She only remained in contact with Mike since everybody else judged her for going no contact. She's getting married to her fiance of 3 years. From what I understand, she and her dad are slowly getting reconciled, but she made it clear she wants him to take no part in the wedding. She asked Mike if he could walk her down the aisle and he agreed. I have to say that I was taken aback and it felt a bit odd for me because, her dad is alive, they're on speaking terms again, he's gonna be there at the wedding so the logical thing to do is have him walk her down the aisle. This role isn't for her older brother but her father. Not to mention how FIL will feel about it. I brought this up with Beth and she had an attitude and implied that I was just saying this and objecting because of how I feel about the situation not how our traditions should be practiced. We got into an argument and I went home. Mike thinks I'm being unreasonable and possibly causing him to miss something so sentimental and that if anything, he feels honored to be asked to do this for her, and said that I should stop worrying about what others might say. Now we're having this conflict (3 of us) and can not seem to reach a solution.",

        "selftext": "UPDATE: I officially submitted the paperwork to John to get payment for the debt. However I decided that would forgive 1/4th of the debt.  So instead of claiming $37K, I am claiming $27,750.00.  I told my siblings that I would forgive a fourth - and if keeping the house for Sara is important to them then they each need to come up with the same.  So far they are saying they will not contribute.  John and I spoke with the lawyer and we were wrong about how any cash from the sale of the house would be dispersed.  First - any liquid assets have to be used to cover debts.  Then if assets need to be liquidated, then whoever was supposed to get that asset gets whatever proceeds are left after paying debts. So no matter what my siblings do - Sara will get the rest of the money if the house is sold.  The lawyer also pointed out the same thing many people here did - that giving Sara the money could affect her benefits.  Instead he suggested she turn down the inheritance in favor of placing the money into a special needs trust for her son. Sara will be talking to the lawyer on her options and exactly what that means. Sara is attempting to get a loan using the house as collateral.  Not all the paperwork is in order yet (exactly how much will be left in the estate after all debts are paid) - and we are probably looking at needing to get a professional appraisal of the home first.  One person at the bank talked to her and said that with her credit score and income she doubts she would be approved - but that she would process the application once Sara got all the data.   ORIGINAL POST: My mother died about 2 months ago. She didn\u2019t leave behind much other than a paid for house (worth about $180K) and a little money in the bank. Mom announced a couple of years ago that she intended to leave her house to my sister Sara who takes care of her severely disabled son full-time.  Mom said that she wanted to make sure they had a roof over their heads and the rest of her kids could make it on their own.  Sara does struggle a lot and has said many times that she wouldn\u2019t have been able to make it without Mom. When Mom died she had some bills outstanding, but her biggest debt was that she owed me $37K. I had loaned her the money so that she could fix her plumbing and septic system, as well as making the house more handicapped friendly for Sara and Jeremy. Mom had been paying me back every month. I have paperwork proving the money is owed. Here is the problem. If I file a claim against her estate like any other creditor would do, my brother John (Mom\u2019s executor) will have no choice but to pay it. But to do so \u2013 he will have to sell the house since there isn\u2019t money in the estate to pay it any other way. Which means that Sara and Jeremy will have to find a different place to live.  I know Mom wanted Sara to have the house. There is also the issue that Mom\u2019s will said Sara got the house, but any money in the estate would be split evenly between the other 4 of us. So technically we think that means Sara wouldn\u2019t actually get anything (John is talking to a lawyer to make sure he is reading that right). Sara is also concerned that if she did get a large amount of money (John and I have both said we would give her whatever we got from the house if it does get sold) \u2013 that it could interfere with the help she gets from the government. John and Sara are both pushing me to not file a claim against the estate. But if I don\u2019t \u2013 then the loan basically goes away. Sara has said that she will pay it back to me and would even sign a new loan. The trouble is that I don\u2019t believe her. She has borrowed money before and never paid it back \u2013 not because she doesn\u2019t want to, but because she can\u2019t afford to. She struggled with money living with Mom \u2013 so it is going to be even worse for her without Mom paying bills in the house as well. If I don\u2019t file a claim \u2013 I will be out $37K \u2013 and that is far more than I want to hand over as a gift \u2013 even to my sister. I\u2019ve told John and Sara that I am officially filing a claim on Monday morning. They are both calling me a greedy asshole and telling me that I am ignoring what Mom wanted. I think it's unreasonable to expect me to just forget $37K.  AITA?",

        "selftext": "My husband and I have been trying for pregnancy for years now, and to cut a long story short it seems as though it will never be a possibility. It took a long time to come to terms with but we've gradually got there. Our entire family is aware of the journey we've been on and how much it meant to us. With that in mind, my husband and I came to his sister (Sarah) with a proposal. Sarah is in her early 30s, unmarried, and vocally against having children of her own. Despite this we thought she might be open to the idea of a surrogate pregnancy on our behalf given she would not have to be involved in raising the child personally. My husband is extremely close to his family and the idea of the entire process of surrogacy being contained to his blood felt extremely important to him. With that closeness in mind, we did not feel it was out of order to ask this sort of question. We invited Sarah over for dinner and at the end of it laid out our request. We told her we had been saving over the years and would be willing to pay her as much as a regular surrogate would be paid (a pretty hefty fee so she would be able to take time off from work if it was required), help her out with everything she needed, plus we had no expectations that she must help raise the child just because she carried it. We told her why it was important to us and how much it'd mean, and asked her to have an open mind about it. Sarah exploded at us. She said we were both out of our minds for making such a request, extremely selfish, and that we had no respect for her disinterest in children. She actually left early. Right now she's refusing to take calls from us and even went as far as to ask my husbands parents to tell us to both not contact her until she decides to initiate it herself. My husbands parents are sympathetic to us but say that we should have kept in mind Sarah's difficulties. My parents think she is behaving awfully. Most of my friends are on my side but a few have said that it was a bit of a rude request given everyone knows how much Sarah hates kids. It's really weighing on my mind and I honestly never expected this kind of outcome. She literally blocked us on every platform she could. Are we really the ones behaving like an asshole?",

I'm of course happy to help and do my fair share for the kids or household, but it's never enough because her standards are too damn high.  She insists one of us has to be up at 6:45 every morning to make sure the kids are ready and make the bus which comes at 7:45. I told her they're old enough to not need that much help already. They can all dress themselves and pour themselves cereal and milk, there's no reason we have to be up. She says that cereal isn't a good enough breakfast, they need something more substantial, especially the 12 year old, and that the 10 year old has adhd and will definitely struggle without help in the morning and anyway she wants to see them off and kiss them goodbye for the day. So she gets up, I don't, then she gets upset that I never give her a morning off when all she needs to do is just take the morning off when she wants and let the kids handle themselves.  Also she is super strict about screen time during the week and is exhausted and snappy from arguing about it with the kids and upset i don't support her strict limit of 2 hours a day. I say as long as homework is done, why not until bed. She says it's not healthy for them, they need to play outside or with games and toys, read some books, just entertain themselves in more ways than 1. I agree they should enjoy other things but not seeing why we have to make such a rigid limit. She also likes to get out on weekends and do stuff like zoos, museums etc, but then complains about the planning for the outing and how grouchy the youngest gets by the end of it, and again, I say let's just chill at home and voila, you've cut the work!  I'm an engaged and active parent, I'm not trying to get out of it, but I don't think I should have to help my wife dig herself out of her own self created holes. She creates the stress for herself and then turns to me to alleviate it which I think is unfair. AITA for telling her she needs to do less and then she won't need this level of help?",

We're mostly in agreement about everything except, I've been kind of having an issue with what she wears especially at nighttime when she unwind and tend to relax a bit as she says. I think that what she wears is inappropriate. She usually wear silky nightwear (nightgowns mostly). She says that's just her style and is what she's been wearing for years. Not just that, but she'd come out of her room dressing like that to grab water or use the bathroom. While yes, it was just me who saw her dressed like that I honestly could not risk having an argument with my husband over it. I suggested she buys some pjs but she said that she doesn't feel comfortable in them. Last night, I saw her in the kitchen grabbing something from the fridge and was dressed in a purple, strapped, knee length nightgown. I tried to speak to her about it but it didn't go well. We started arguing and I ended up telling her to stop leaving her room when she's wearing stuff like that and she argued that there was nothing wrong with what she was wearing, that it wasn't like she was walking around naked or anything of the sort. I told her it's my home and she's a guest and should just respect my request but she responded saying that just because she lives in my house does not mean that I have the right to control what she wears then stormed off to her room. We haven't talked since then and she is refusing to talk about it. Edit: I wanna post a pic of the nightgown but don't know how. I'll see what I can do. Edit: here's the dress. It's not identical but close to what she was wearing, very close.  https://ae01.alicdn.com/kf/HTB1qKAoff2H8KJjy0Fcq6yDlFXav/3-Colors-Adult-Women-Claret-Black-Night-Gown-Ladies-Spring-Autumn-Lace-Silk-Sleep-Dress-Knee.jpg_Q90.jpg_.webp  Look at it and give judgement.

When my DIL was pregnant, I suggested that I host a welcoming party for my grandson right after she get discharged from the hospital. I've made arrangements and even emptied a room for them to stay but for some reason, she was against it and said she'd rather spend the first few weeks at home with her newborn. not only that but she said no to the welcoming party. My husband and I talked to my son and he said we'll see. But just a couple a days ago, We found out that my daughter in law had given birth 2 weeks ago and no one knew about it. My nephew told me and I immediately called my son, he confirmed it. he and his wife lied then hid the date of birth from the family. I told him this was not acceptable, lying just because they didn't want a welcoming party and love and support being given from family. I told him I was disappointed because for one...he ruined our welcoming for our grandbaby and also, I invited family members and they're all rightfully disappointed as well. He said it was his last resort after I kept pushing and made his wife uncomfortable but that was not appreciated because.. we were just trying to celebrate the new family member in a proper manner. We had an argument and he ended the call upon saying I ruined his joy for his newborn. My husband started texting him since he stopped replying to our phonecalls and now is threatening to block my nephew for tattling but I think that my nephew was decent enough to inform the family. otherwise God knows how long my son and his wife were going to hide their son just to keep us at arms length. We've always been kind and welcoming to my daughter in law and ger family, I don't why she would do this and disrespect the family like that. on the other hand, some family members see it as a justified action because we insisted on the party. Ps: Some folks, I'd appreciate it if you leave my nephew (m24) out of this conflict because he's not part of it.",

Issues began to arise between Dahlia and mom and I had to ask my friend, Anthony (M31) to let us move in til I get enough money to rent out. His wife was away visiting family and he agreed but even there, some issues started to arise. Fyi, Dahlia is very shy around Anthony. She grew up in conservative home and so it's understandable, but sometimes it can be a bit much I admit that!  For example, she freaked out when she accidently drank from his glass, she also once made a fuss when he passed by the guests room when she was lying down and the door was open. Thankfully, Anthony was super understanding and we were able to talk some of these issues out. Last night, Dahlia was passing the hall and noticed a framed picture of Anthony and his wife kissing hanging on the wall. She told me about it and said it made her uncomfortable. She asked if I could speak to Anthony about it but he didn't take it well. He gave me a look when I spoke to him and said this was bonkers because first of all, his wife put it there. And second of all, the picture holds sentimental meaning to him and his wife and argued that it wasn't some explicit picture of them, just a normal wedding kiss. We started arguing and he said that it wasn't like it was hanging in the living room wall or a perfectly lit room. I asked him to be a little more considerate because it's not like I asked him to remove it completely, just move it elsewhere that Dahlia won't reach or keep it off the wall til we leave. He said he was sorry but still refused. I explained how Dahlia was feeling but he said that again, he was sorry but would not move the picture. We argued some more and he said that it's his house and that I was being pushy and kind of too comfortable to make such demand and be pushy still. This morning, Dahlia refused to even come out of the room until the picture is moved. Anthony is refusing which makes it worse. Now I feel like I'm getting stuck between a rock and a hard place. Yes she might just be over reacting but I feel like this isn't such a big ask for Anthony to decline and turn down. fwiw If it were me, I'd go the extra mile to make sure my guests are comfortable. Anthony has been a friend of mine for 10 years. I wouldn't have asked to move in with him if I didn't have such strong bond with him. He himself constantly talks about all the things and situations I helped him out with and we are considered brothers.",

I have full custody and her mom is not involved in her life.  5 years ago I married my wife Nina(F31) we tried to have a child but couldn't. We went to the doctor and turned out I can't have anymore kids due to some complications. We decided to use an sperm donor and the result was a son, Mark, who was born a few months ago.  The problems started when Nina got pregnant. Harper wasn't happy about it. When Mark was born things got worse. Before this Harper and I used to spend 2 days a week together, just the 2 of us without my wife but after Mark was born I couldn't do that anymore. I can't just leave my wife alone for 2 days a week with a newborn and Harper has been very angry about it.  The main problem started 3 days ago. Nina and I decided to make a nursery for Mark instead of having him in our bedroom for multiple reasons.  Our home has 4 bedrooms, 2 master bedrooms at one side and 2 bedrooms at the other side. One of the master rooms is ours, the other one is Harpers. It was very hard for Nina and I to go to the other side of the home multiple times at night when Mark wakes up so I asked Harper pack her stuff and go to one of the bedrooms so that we could give her room to Mark. At first everything seemed alright. She said ok and went to her room and started packing but less than an hour later my brother showed up at our home, asking for Harper. She had called him and asked him to take her. She came out of her room with her stuff, told me you can give it to your son now and left with my brother. I told her she could only go for one night but it has been 3 days and she is not back and wont even talk to me.  Im receiving calls from my family all calling me an AH and other names.  I dont trust their judgement, they very clearly favor Harper. She was the first grandchild in our family and everyone's favorite also they are trying to accept Mark as my son but I could see that they haven't been able yet so I decided to post here and get some unbiased opinions. AITA? Edit: Here is the update that I promised  I realized I've messed up so I went to my brothers home and tried to get Harper back but he didn't even let me see her, saying she doesn't want to see me.  He said he would only let her go back if:  1. She wanted to go with me  2. We move to another home close to their home because they wanted to have Harper close to them to keep an eye on her and make sure we are treating her right, we used to live very close to them but when I got married my wife and family didn't get along so we moved somewhere farther away which made Harper very sad.  3. Harper will get to choose which bedroom she wants in our new home  4. I should spend 1 on 1 time with Harper at least one day a week  Which I accepted.  This caused a lot of problems since my wife doesn't like some of those conditions. she thinks they are not reasonable. She got angry, took Mark and went to her parents home and is staying there so now I'm also receiving texts from my inlaws calling me an AH.  Right now Im looking for a new home that is closer to my brother's home  I called Harper and my brother convinced her to talk to me for once. she was crying the whole time while telling me that she felt like I didn't want her anymore. Hearing her cry like that really broke my heart. I honestly never meant to hurt her.  After so many apologies and gifts she finally agreed to see me. I will go to my brother's home everyday to spend time with Her. She has also finally agreed to come home with me when I find a new home.",

My GF has beautiful hair that seems a lot more low maintenance than most women I know. She doesn\u2019t use all a hundred different hair products, nor does she blow dry it. It honestly doesn\u2019t take her long to style her hair or anything. However, she always insist on using this special towel to dry her hair.  She insists that she can\u2019t use any regular towel for her hair. She gets mad if I use her hair towel as a regular towel too. She says that the towel should only be used for hair. She even bought an extra one of these towels that she keeps in her drawer at my place. She also takes the towel with her when she goes on vacation.  I usually don\u2019t mind it, since the towel doesn\u2019t take up much space, and it better than listening to a hair dryer all the time. But it\u2019s a bit weird because I don\u2019t know anyone else who has a towel just for their hair.  For Thanksgiving, we travelled to see my family. Before the trip, I asked my GF to leave her towel at home since we\u2019ll be staying at my parents\u2019 house. I didn\u2019t want my family to think she was weird or make fun of her.  Since we planned to leave early in the morning, GF spent the night at my place. I noticed that she packed the towel she kept at my place in her suitcase. When she was asleep, I took the towel out. She didn\u2019t notice the towel was gone until after we got to my parent\u2019s house.  I thought it was okay, and my GF didn\u2019t seem mad at all during the whole trip. However, when we got back at my place, my GF got into her car and drove off without saying goodbye. She texted me later saying she\u2019s mad at me because of that stupid towel and she needs some space. I keep calling and texting her, but she won\u2019t respond.  My friends think she\u2019s being overly dramatic, but my GF isn\u2019t that type of person. Now I\u2019m wondering if I messed up. AITA",

I was in a higher end department store today (rhymes with loomingtales) and happened to end up next to two teenage aged girls while shopping. One of the girls had picked out a pair of VERY expensive boots and they were both fawning over them. Second girl must have looked at price tag and asks boots girl if she\u2019s really gonna spend that much on boots. Girl with boots says something along the lines of \u201cit\u2019s fine I have my dads credit card I\u2019m not paying \u201d which instantly caught my attention because THATS NOT HER CARD. I\u2019ve told my son multiple times he\u2019s never allowed to use my card so I\u2019m interested to see how this girl thinks she\u2019s going to get away with fraud but had split up from the girls at this point because they had found something else. We end up at the same register (me behind) and I see her total hit well over four digits. The girl is about to swipe her card when I decide that I can\u2019t let her get away with something like this and someone has to parent this kid if no one else will. I tell cashier that isn\u2019t her card but her father\u2019s and I\u2019m not sure she has permission. Girl and friend turn and glare at me giving me possibly the dirtiest look I\u2019ve ever seen. I swear this girl was going to throw a tantrum right there, I don\u2019t think she was ever told no. Girl tells cashier her father gave her the card to shop with because it\u2019s the stores credit card and it gives him the points. Now that I\u2019ve pointed out it wasn\u2019t hers cashier tells her she can\u2019t use that card. Girl tries to show ID to prove they have the same last name ( yeah that will help) and I tell her it\u2019s still fraud. Girl says it\u2019s not fraud because she has permission and tells me to mind my own business. I tell her that it is my business that she\u2019s doing something illegal she needs to pay with her own card or I call the cops. Girl is pissed now and people are glaring at me. She uses her own card and leaves crying. Cashier looks mad at me and I tell my husband when I get home only for him to agree I was in the wrong.  So Reddit, ATIA?",

She is a very smart girl and I'm proud of what she's accomplished. But she's also young and naive in a lot of ways. She's easily manipulated. She doesn't pay much attention to her surroundings. She can't stand up for herself. She constantly still calls or texts myself and her father for help with things. More recently,  I've also been concerned about her doing dangerous things or submitting to peer pressure from her 'friends'. I've met them and they are not good kids. I've told her to stop talking to them but she refuses and tries to go behind my back. For these reasons (among others), her father and I have decided that we are not going to let her go off to college as long as she's a minor under our care. This means that she won't be going in fall ~~2025~~ 2024 because she doesn't turn 18 until that December. I am not trying to stifle her, but I do want her to be safe. She was recently talking about starting to fill out college applications and I told her not to bother. I explained that we weren't letting her go until she's old enough to make that decision for herself. She started crying and yelling at me but I refused to budge. I don't think I'm being unreasonable and honestly her reaction is more evidence of immaturity. But apparently she texted her Aunt who has been calling me an asshole. Am I the asshole? Edit: fall 2024, not fall 2025. Edit 2: people seem to think that I will not allow her to go to college at all. I am absolutely willing to let her go to college once she's 18 and we will pay for it, wherever she wants to go (we have the means).",

However I recently told my husband that I don't feel comfortable with the idea of his brother spending much time with my daughteronce she's born. It's not because of my BIL himself. We're not close but he's fine. The issue is his life choices. He's not married, has no intention of getting married or having kids, and dates only for sexual purpose. He dates multiple women and the only thing he has in common with them is that, like him, they are extremely good looking. He's highly intelligent, yet he has no interest in meaningful relationships. I spoke to him about his choices a few years ago, and after accusing me of being'moralistic', he claims that he always uses protection and he never leads the women on. Which I call BS on, as I can't imagineany woman with an increasing ticking biological clock would willingly be in a relationship which she knows doesn't have a future. Not to mention, what woman would want to be with someonewho may not even remember your name in a year's time? I mentioned this to my husband, however he called me an AH, and said that it was ridiculous to limit our daughter's access with her uncle just because I don't agree with his legal dating choices.

We have decided that we don\u2019t want children at our wedding. Not many of our friends and family have young children, and the ones that do are fine with getting a sitter for the weekend since we gave them a lot of notice. The only ones to put up a fight are my aunt and uncle who have a daughter with autism. She is 20, but will be 21 by the time my wedding day comes around. She is what they call \u201chigh-functioning\u201d, which means she can talk and wash/dress herself, and she has some friends. She graduated from high school a couple years ago and is currently living with her parents (my aunt and uncle) while working at a grocery store. Despite her being technically an adult I just don\u2019t see her as such. Every time I talk to her at a family gathering it\u2019s like talking to a child. She is obsessed with toy ponies and barbie dolls, and brings them up at every opportunity. She draws in her notebook constantly and never makes eye contact when talking to me. She does not have loud meltdowns like other special needs kids I\u2019ve met before, but I really don\u2019t want to risk her ruining my special day. I told my aunt and uncle that I didn\u2019t want her there and they became very upset. They said she already saw the invite and knew it was child-free but because she is an \u201cadult\u201d, she thought she was still included. My aunt tried to guilt me by saying she\u2019d already picked out a dress and a gift but I didn\u2019t want to hear it. My fianc\u00e9 says I\u2019m being an asshole and we should let her attend because she has attended other weddings before with no issue.

        "selftext": "This is a throwaway and I'm using fake names. I am 26F and my adopted sister Ally is 14F. The way we're related is that my younger brother Michael (24M) has been with his wife Maya (24F) since their freshman year of high school. Maya and Ally had a really bad home life and my mom is very much a my home is open to everyone type of person, so over that year Maya began spending more and more time at our house, eventually bringing Ally over as well since she was always babysitting. By the time Michael and Maya were 16 years old, Maya basically lived in the guest room and Ally spent after school, most weekends, holidays, and summer vacation at our house. My mom and dad say that they love both Maya and Ally like their own children. My other siblings (18M and 16F) also treat her like she's a part of the family. Even after Maya and Michael moved out, Ally is still at their house the same amount, if not more than she was before. Now to preface, I have nothing against Ally. She's a good kid and I make an effort to be nice to her. However, I've never really liked how she was foisted into our lives. She's not actually adopted and she *still has parents and her own family*. Yet my parents spend so much time and resources on her, it's ridiculous. Everyone else has started unironically calling her their daughter or sister and I've refused. I just don't consider her to be family. Anyways, I got married recently, which is where the issues start. I invited Ally to the wedding, of course, and she came with all of my other family. When we were doing pictures of the wedding parties, I decided that I wanted one with all of my immediate family (so my parents, my siblings, and Maya, and Maya and Michael's daughter). My mom brought Ally up to come take the picture with us and I was forced to tell her no. My mom started to get upset but then Ally said it was okay and sat down by herself. My mom isn't a very confrontational person so she didn't make a big deal of it but then everyone else realized that Ally wasn't there and they got mad as well. Ultimately, we took the photo how I wanted it because they didn't want to do this at my wedding but my entire family is pissed at me now. My mom said that Ally cried when she got home because I don't love her, which I don't. I feel like they forced into a position where I had to do an asshole thing by forcing this kid onto me. I don't think I should have to consider her family if I don't want to. AITA? Edit: After the ceremony but before the reception, the wedding party and both of our close family's took photos. I did not include Ally in this photo session and she sat with the rest of the regular guests waiting for dinner. I did not intentionally exclude her from any of the photos taken. I'm sure she's in some of them from throughout the night especially because she was there with my family. I hope that clears some things up. Edit 2: Maya and Ally are sisters. Sorry, forgot to explicitly say that in my post. Final edit:  The people who are agreeing with me are starting to convince me that I'm wrong. To the people calling my parents nasty things in my pms or just saying that they aren't good people: you're dead wrong. My mom is the most caring and kind-hearted woman in the world and I should have made that more clear in my post.  To be clear, I am also not a monster. I don't mistreat Ally. I get her birthday and Christmas gifts every year. However I am starting to understand that I did do a shitty thing by publicly excluding her at my wedding because I wanted it to be how exactly how I imagined, especially because my mom was apparently blindsided by my feelings. I was 16-18 when Ally started coming around a lot and I didn't form the same bond everyone else did. I never super liked being around kids, including my sister who by all accounts behaved way worse than Ally ever did. But I recognize that she's become a part of our family. And I think I'm going to make more of an effort to get to know her properly, because I do know she is very mature and intelligent for her age. Also, I don't mean to minimize what Maya and Ally have gone through. By saying she wasn't physically abused, I moroso meant to explain why she hadn't been legally removed from her mother's house. She does have extended family that actually cares about her but they live at minimum an hour away so she stays with my parents the majority of the time. Thank you for all of your input.",

My daughter (Anna) has recently started to date an African American man (Jamal). While I'm not exactly what you would refer to as liberal, he's a nice young man and as long as my daughter is happy, I'm happy. The problem is Anna is rather naive about the community she lives in. While her friends are quite content to see a relationship like hers, more than a few tongues are wagging in the community and a few people have privately expressed their concern to me. As I said, I have no problem with mixed relationships and I've set them straight, but I am painfully aware of how these matters are viewed by certain segments of the population. My parents are planning to come and stay with us for a week and Anna expressed a desire to introduce Jamal to them now that things were getting more serious between them. I told her on no uncertain terms that this wasn't going to happen. I may have no problem with Jamal, but they *absolutely will*, and even when the relationship ends they won't forget it. They might even go as far as to cut her off entirely. Anna was extremely upset by this and implied I was a racist and more concerned with what my parents think than how she feels. As I said, I know my parents. They simply aren't okay with mixed relationships and if Anna were to bring Jamal over even as a friend, they would be furious both at her *and* me. Anna is currently staying with Jamal and doesn't want to speak with me right now. My wife stands by me given she knows very well how my parents are (they had a problem with her for months over the *length of the skirt* she wore when I introduced her to them, for christs sake), but a close friend I confided in told me that I have behaved like an ass and that I needed to focus more on my daughter than pleasing my parents.

We are madly in love and ready to commit ourselves to each other fully.  My sister (26 F) has a problem with that though. She was supportive of my relationship with Derrick before we got engaged. When I sent her a text telling her we were engaged, she responded by saying \u201ccongratulations.\u201d But then when I saw her the week after that, she got all serious and said I should strongly consider the marriage.  She told me I was young and could meet people I loved more. That was offensive to me because I love Derrick more than anything, and she\u2019s basically saying my love isn\u2019t that important. She also told me that Derrick and I could date for longer before we got married. But we are already fully committed to each other, so we might as well get married and be recognized as soul mates in the eyes of the law.  Anyway, the conversation was so hurtful to me.

        "selftext": "My BF (33M) and I (29F) have been dating for 3 years.  He owns a house and lives there by himself.  I live in an apartment by myself.  We've talked about moving in together as that's the logical next step in our relationship and we both want to do it.  But I have some hang-ups related to moving into a house that I don't have any stake in.   I am refusing to pay any money that would go directly towards his mortgage.  I don't have any stake in the house, why would I contribute to his mortgage payments?  I'm ok helping with utilities, groceries, household items, etc. But paying his mortgage is a hard no from me.  I just don't think it makes any sense for me to pay towards his mortgage when I would get nothing from that if we were to break up.   His argument is that I would essentially be living with him for free and it would cause an uneven dynamic in our payment towards shared living expenses.  Which, I kind of get, but at the same time he's the one benefitting from paying down the mortgage and gaining equity, not me.  He also argued that his mortgage is pretty much exactly what I was paying in rent, so by cutting that in half I am saving a lot of money on living costs compared to living on my own.  Which, yeah, that's nice too, but legally it's still not my house. I told him the only way I would pay money for rent is if he signs a contract with me stating that any money I pay towards his mortgage will be paid back to me, by him, in the event that we break up.  It would also allow me protection from eviction and other basic tenant rights, similar to a rental agreement.  He is refusing to sign anything like that because, in his words, I could break up with him for no reason and then take him to court for thousands of dollars.  Which, I suppose is true but I wouldn't just break up with him for no reason. This whole situation is driving a wedge between us and he's pissed at me for being so difficult when all he thinks he is asking is that we split living expenses 50-50 if we are to live together.  To me, it's not that simple when he's the one owning the house we would live in.  If I were on the title, it would be a different story, but he's not willing to put me on the title because he's lived there for 7 years already.   My lease at my apartment is up in 2 months and I know I need to make a decision sooner than later.  It doesn't help that my landlord is going to be increasing my rent, and similar apartments in our area are going for even more than I'm currently paying.  But I just don't feel right contributing money towards his mortgage.  I also know that if I renew my lease, it's pretty much a dagger to our relationship, which I don't want because I do love him and see a future with him.  I just want to make sure I'm protected. I can tell my BF's patience on this is wearing thin and he's upset with me for digging my heels in on this.  But for me, this is about protecting myself for the worst-case scenario while he's not really risking anything.",

She says the gift bags. I found all the candy and toys and what I thought were the bags they were supposed to go into. So I make up the bags, my daughter helps, and she thinks they look great and she's happy with them. My wife comes home and takes over, satisfied by the new cake and the attempt I made at helping. So a little while after that, the guests arrive. The day went pretty well until the end. My daughter reminds us that they need to hand out gift bags. My wife panics thinking she forgot about them, but she says dont worry, dad made them and she looked so relieved until I got the box. She looked inside an was horrified What the fuck is this? she whispers. And she thrusts the box back at me and rushes to the bedroom. I follow her and find her sitting on the bed crying. She's SO embarrassed. Why? She wont say. I'm not sure what to do because people are trying to leave and they're confused as to whats going on. I then I just take over goodbye duty and hand out the bags to kids at the door and say bye with my daughter. Well halfway through doing that my wife came back out and took the box from me and brought it into the bedroom and threw it on the ground. wtf? she finally tells me those are dog poop bags and basically I'm stupid and I've ruined all the hard work she put into the party. well, reddit, they dont look like dog poop bags. they're just small pink bags with hearts on them. who really cares? I tell her It's not like they're dirty. they're small bags like any other bags and damn it she freaked. She says she's so mortified she doesnt even want to show her face at the school anymore. So yeah I've been bringing my daughter to school every day this week (which has been making me late for work). my wife will barely even speak to me even though my daughter thinks everything was fine. she laughed when i told her they were really dog poop bags. my wife got even more mad at me for telling her. I told my wife she needs to chill and she basically said I was a huge asshole and she's mad that I dont think it's a big deal. and I still dont. Actually, I think I'm the one that should be mad at HER for keeping this going for almost a week. So, Reddit, AITA? TL;DR: I used dog poop bags as goody bags by accident for 6 year old daughter's bday party",

This made my family feel let down especially my sister who wanted him there and also her 18th birthday was a big deal to her obviously.  To my surprise, When I arrived I noticed that my husband was having his meeting at the same place, his table was right in the corner and he had about 4 men sitting with him. My parents and the guests saw him as well. I waved for him and he saw me but ignored me. He obviously was as much as surprised as I was.  My parents asked why he didn't even come to the table to acknowledge them after the cake arrived. I got up and walked up to his table. I stood there and said excuse me, my husband was silent when I asked (after I introduced myself to the clients) if he'd take few minutes to join me and the family in candle blowing and say happy birthday but he barely let out a phrase and said I don't think so, I'm busy right now. I insisted saying it'd just take a couple of minutes and that it'd mean so much to my sister. He stared at me then stared awkwardly back at his clients. They said nothing and he got up after my parents were motionning for me to hurry up. He sat with us while my sister blew the candles and cut the cake. My parents insisted he takes a piece and join us in the selfie but he got up and walked back to his table looking pissed. We haven't talked til we met later at home. He was upset and starred scolding me infront of my parents saying I embarrassed him and made him look unprofessional and ruined his business meeting. I told him he overreacted since it only took few minutes and it was my sister's birthday and my family wanted him to join since he was literally in the same restaurant. He called me ignorant and accused me of tampering with his work but I responded that ignoring mine and my family's presence was unacceptable. We argued then he started stone walling me and refusing to talk to me at all. FYI) I didn't have an issue with him missing the event, but after seeing that he was already there then it become a different story. Also it literally took 5-7 minutes. He didn't even eat nor drink. Just sat down and watched.",

        "selftext": "So I recently found out that my boyfriend has been buying and drinking raw (unpasteurized) milk. He grew up on a farm and apparently his family always drank it straight from the cow, and he's been doing the same ever since we moved in together. At first I didn\u2019t think much of it (being a vegan I never drank it myself) but I started doing some research after I saw the label on it literally says not for human consumption. Apparently raw milk can carry harmful bacteria like salmonella, E. coli, and listeria. I freaked out when I read that, I don't want him to get sick or expose me to something dangerous. So, when I saw a fresh bottle of raw milk in our fridge yesterday I panicked and poured the entire bottle down the drain. I thought it was the safest thing to do. When my boyfriend got home he immediately noticed and was pissed. He said he spent a lot of money on that milk and that he\u2019s been drinking it for years without a problem. He accused me of not trusting him and said I had no right to throw away something he enjoys just because I disagree with it. I tried explaining that I was just concerned for his health and ours, but he said I was being a control freak. Now he's barely talking to me and I feel like there\u2019s this huge distance between us. AITA for pouring out the milk? I thought I was doing the right thing but I'm starting to wonder if I overstepped.",

        "selftext": "I 33M recently got hired at a large company in the south where me and my wife moved months ago. My wife was excited for my new job and talked about preparing a surprise for me which got me excited but I didn't what it was til she showed up at my workplace 2 days ago with a meal she said she prepared specifically for me since it's my favorite. Apparently this was her surprise. I was little upset she brought it to my workplace. My co workers who are vicious and brutally honest and sarcastic got involved and kept teasing me about the meal. one of them Austin joked about how mommy is so supportive by bringing food to my workplace. I felt like shit as he and other co workers kept laughing at me. I went to work the next day and Austinkept making jokes about me saying shit like is mommy going to bring lunch today as well? And When is mommy coming to change your diaper? And some other shit. one of them who's someone I don't know well said oh you guys I can still smell the meal (my name's) mom brought yesterday. She's such great cook bless her heart! And the goddamned giggles kept on. I felt so awful I went home and just blew up at my wife telling her she flatout fucking embarrassed me and just torpedoed any goddamned prestige and respect I had among my co workers. I told her what Austin and others have been doing and asked if she was happy for giving him emmo to come at me like that. She argued that she was just trying to do something nice for me and didn't care about what people might say but I was a selfish jerk who only cares about what others think rather than how she felt by my constant berating over a meal she put effort money and time to make and bring to me. The argument escalated after I suggested that she could've waited til I got home to surprise me with this goddamned meal instead of showing up while I was working which made me seem unprofessional. she said she came during lunch break but I was still working during lunch break. She said at this point I clearly find it easier to blame her than stand up for myself against those childish bullies. I said I didn't appreciate what she said but she replied that I should be grateful she cared enough to bring me a home cooked meal then thanked me for showing her it's not worth wasting anymore of her time cooking for me after this. I told her to stop blaming me for something she caused and asked her to admit that maybe she should've consulted me before bringing the meal over so I could avoid being the goddamned butt of every joke my co workers told. I don't even know how long this is going to last. She told me to man up and either report them or quit then. I was floored by what she said I had to walk out becuase I couldn't take anymore of this and felt like she wasn't listening to how her behavior caused me an issue at work. Edit to say that I in no way don't appreciate my wife's effort but the only problem I have is that she didn't tell me beforehand about wether it was okay to bring the meal over to my workplace. I really prefered that she waited til I got home or we could've gone out later to eat. I agree that the main problem I have is my co workers but I lashed out because I felt overwhelmed with their hurtful remarks that offended my wife as well.",

        "selftext": "I (28m) and have been married to my wife Bella (28f) for 5 years. We both met and went to the same college. She pre-law while I was doing animation. She graduated top of our class and went to a T20 law school. While she was in law school, I had a lot of trouble finding a job in my field or a job at all, really. I ended up working in a kitchen as a line cook to help support us (in addition to loans she took out) while she was going to school so she could just focus on her classes. Bella got a very good job in a different state after she graduated, so I quit my job and haven't gotten another one since. We have no kids, a nice house for the two of us, and are overall living very very comfortably. She works very long hours, so I take care of most of the household things. Cleaning, cooking, grocery shopping, re-painting the walls and doing other work and renovations to the house. In the last 6 months Bella's started referring to me as her house husband around our family and friends. I've mostly been letting it go but every single time it bothers me. I'm already insecure about not being able to find a good job and it makes me feel even more inadequate. I finally got to the end of my rope when we were with her mother on Sunday, who still doesn't really approve of me, and they were talking about taking care of the lawn/garden and she said, Thank goodness I have a house husband for that or I'd never find the time and smiled at me. Then they both laughed. It was humiliating.  I didn't say anything at first but I guess she could tell that I was really upset and asked what was wrong. I told her that she needed to stop emasculating me and making it seem like I didn't contribute anything to the household. We were arguing back and forth and she told me that she would stop calling me a house husband if I was going to get that upset about it but that it wasn't an untrue term and I needed to stop being insecure.  Bella refuses to apologize. I feel like she doesn't fully appreciate my value as her husband. I've stopped doing the chores until she apologizes and she is beyond pissed off. She's been coming home and cooking dinner (only for herself) and doing the chores I haven't and then taking off to spend the night at a friends house. I was talking to my sister about it and she told me that Bella was wrong but I was being immature in my response. The thing is, if I give in she's going to keep thinking what she's been doing is okay. I don't even know anymore. AITA?",

        "selftext": "My BIL (married to my sister) is a general contractor. About 10 years ago, my dad and brother was building a deck at my parent\u2019s home. They asked my BIL if they could borrow his skid loader but he said no. They prepared the ground as best they could without the skid loader but got to the point they couldn\u2019t go on without it. They went to my sis\u2019s house to ask again but found out BIL went out of town. They talked my sis into letting them borrow it so she took them down to his construction lot and they hooked it up to dad\u2019s truck.  This next part I\u2019m not sure of since I don\u2019t know much about towing but from what I was told, dad\u2019s truck wasn\u2019t big enough or powerful enough to tow the skid loader on the dump trailer so he lost control and wrecked. The truck, trailer, and skid loader was totaled. The insurance was barely enough to cover the medical costs and the truck. There was none left over to cover BIL\u2019s stuff. When he got back to town, he exploded. He threaten to sue and things just went downhill from there. My parents are not rich and he wouldn\u2019t have gotten anything so in the end, sis talked him into letting it go.  However, from that day on he wouldn\u2019t have anything to do with our family. He doesn\u2019t come for birthdays, holidays, nothing at all. Next month is our parent\u2019s 50th anniversary and we\u2019re planning a big family gathering to celebrate. We\u2019re also chipping in to send our parents on a cruise to Mexico because they\u2019ve never been out of the country. I spoke to sis about it the other day and she said she\u2019s coming with the kids but BIL is not coming. I was fine with that but when we were discussing their portion of the cruise money, I heard him yelling in the background to deduct their portion from the cost of the skid loader and dump trailer. That pissed me if so after my call with sis, I called BIL and told him to get over himself. I told Dad and bro made a mistake but that was 10 years ago and he needs to let it go. He said he\u2019ll let out go when they give him the money he lost. I told him he\u2019s an ass for holding on to a grudge and putting money in the way of a family relationship.  Sis called me a few minutes ago and said they\u2019re not coming and that I was out of line. We argued for a bit and that\u2019s where it stands.  I don\u2019t think I\u2019m wrong for telling him to let go of the past but they\u2019re not coming to the anniversary party so now I\u2019m not sure. Answers to your questions: Let\u2019s get something straight. My dad and brother are not bad people. They are good people who made a mistake. They couldn\u2019t pay back BIL because he wanted almost $70,000 and again, we\u2019re not rich. Dad had to buy another truck because he needed it to go to work. On the other hand, BIL had 3 other sets of skid loaders and dump trailers on his lot that day so he could take the financial hit while my parents would be homeless. BIL and sis are way better off then the rest of us so while I understand your reasoning of paying BIL back, he doesn\u2019t need it. The cruise to Mexico isn\u2019t some millionaire trip. The total cost is about $3,000 and it\u2019ll take over 20 people to pay for that. Again, we\u2019re not rich. We can barely cover $3,000 spread out over 20 people so there\u2019s no way we can pay $70,000.",

I moved in with him after our marriage because the rent was super cheap. My parents recently came to me asking if they could park their RV at our home.I didn\u2019t see a problem with this. Our yards are really big and there is space.Because of city ordinance the RV has to be parked in the back yard. There was no RV gate in the fence. My husband went to his aunt and asked if we could install a rv gate? His aunt said no. My husband relayed the message to me and my parents seemed upset when I told them. 2 days ago. I came home from work and saw that my dad had a construction crew at our home and had removed part of the fence for the gate. There was a apple tree in the way. They couldn\u2019t fit the RV in the yard. My husband angry told my dad not to continue and that they needed to repair the fence.At this point I felt like it was pointless. The fence guys already built the columns for the gate. It would cost a lot more money to rebuild the fence. I told my dad to finish the job but make sure it was left super clean. That it looked nice. I planned on talking to the aunt later and explain what happened.What I didn\u2019t know was my dad told the guys to remove the tree. My husbands aunt came by and saw the tree cut down and started to cry. She has refused to talk to my dad or me. When my husband came home he found a 30 day notice on our door.Terminating our lease.

Step-daughter and I get along fine no big issues but we also are not super close. Now that the baby is coming we need more space unfortunately we can't afford a new home. I brought up to my husband asking Step-daughter to move out. My reasoning is that we really need her room for the new baby and she is an adult with a full time job so it is time for her to be on her own anyway. My husband agreed and we brought it up to her at dinner one night. We told her we would help with her first 2 months rent. I told her it would be fun her and I could go shopping and I will help her decorate her new apartment. We tried to be as gentle as we could but she was very quiet.  Privately she told my husband that even though she as a full time job she cannot afford to live on her own. My husband told her she did not need to move out so now we are scrambling trying to find space for new baby. The other day I was home alone with Step- daughter and tried to talk to her about it again. I offered  to help her find a roommate and she snapped on me. She snapped on me and told me to just leave her alone and locked herself in her room. When my husband got home from work he was mad at me and told me to leave her alone and not bring it up anymore.

My MIL says it's showing off and my FIL always says it isn't christian. Now I'm pretty feminine, so I don't mind throwing on a dress when we stop by, but our daughters are not. They don't like visiting my husbands parents, which breaks his heart, because we make them put on a dress before they go. They are both pretty tomboyish, and they never wear any dresses otherwise. I had to but each of them a few dresses specifically so they can go. To be clear it's not like they aren't allowed over if they wear pants, it's just that they won't shut up the entire time about how much they hate it. Our daughters hate this, and think it's unfair. I guess it is, but in a lot of cultures women only wear skirts and dresses so I don't think it's a big deal. Plus it isn't like it hurts them to wear a dress a few times a week for a few hours. The issue is our oldest is planning to never speak to her grandparents again after she's 18, and I'm worried it's affecting them.",

        "selftext": "My son is 8 years old and recently attended his friend's 8th birthday party. This friend is my best friend's son. I don't let my son have any/much junk food at all and usually he brings his own snacks (for this incident it was carrot sticks and ranch) to events that have a lot of sugary foods. My best friend bakes a lot, and made a special chocolate cake for her son's birthday. When it comes to my son, I don't let him have cake. This is personal preference for his health, not for any allergy reasons, and he is not diabetic or gluten free. My son knows he isn't allowed to have cake because of the additives. When he told his best friend this at the party, his friend apparently got upset and told him it was good cake, not bad like I say, because his mom made it, and it was his birthday cake. My son ate cake, got a sugar rush, and crashed, making him cranky for the rest of the day after we left the party.  I told my friend she needs to have some kind of consequences for her son to teach him not to peer pressure other children into eating things they're not allowed to have. She said because it wasn't an issue of allergies or health, that she's sorry my son was cranky but she won't be punishing her son or talking to him about it on his birthday. She says also that she'll just that she'll watch more closely/make sure her husband does in the future, as well as have a chat with him on another day about respecting food habits. (I love my friend, but historically, her and her husband have always said 'yes' to their son and not given him any consequences for anything.) Both of us were present at the party and did not see them sharing the cake (they were outside eating in the backyard with their fathers and some other parents supervising while we cleaned up) so it's not an issue of anyone going behind anyone's back, just teaching children boundaries and respect.  I let my son stay for the rest of the party and be with his friend, so it's not like I ruined the day.  AITA for being upset with my friend's son and the fact that she won't punish her son for pressuring my son into eating cake?",

        "selftext": "To start, free bleeding is essentially not wearing any form of protection on your period (so you are bleeding freely - clues in the name). I'm currently staying at my MILs house with my husband for a family get together (six birthdays in one week). I have horrifically painful periods and bad mobility. I can not use cups and am allergic to all brands of pad I've used (rashes on all genitalia, which does not feel good). I do have cloth pads but I only brought a couple small ones for my trip as I wasn't due on until days after we got home, but we're on day four of our trip and I started my period on our first night.  I tried to use some disposable pads I picked up but I broke out in a rash and have blisters everywhere they should not be, so two days ago I decided to say what the hell and free bleed like I do at home. I bring my own towels to my MILs, so I have been sitting and sleeping on those. I have bled through twice but cleaned the mess and left no stain.  My MIL is pissed off to say the least. She's disgusted by my lack of decorum and carrying my bloody towel around everywhere. She also hates that I'm washing them in her machines and is now saying we need to pay to have them professionally cleaned (which we will do). Everything kinda came to a head last night when she lost it on me for behaving like an animal. She wants me to leave, but my husband stay, which isn't possible (one car, I can't drive that far, especially not with the amount of pain I'm in). My husband is on damage control but I just feel so shitty. Am I in the wrong here? I understand that it's not super sanitary but my health matters more than some bed sheets. I'll replace them if she wants. I'm close to just gritting my teeth through the pain and putting a pad on, but I really don't want to. I don't want open sores down there when we're driving home - sitting for that long will suck. AITA? I feel like I'm choosing the lessar of two evils but now I don't know.",

I don\u2018t normally go through her room, but the router for the house is in there, and I needed to reset it. When I go into her room, I found a mushroom cap on black paper hidden underneath her desk. I look up what the hell it is and it is a spore print for magic mushrooms. I go through her room further to find an entire damn aqarium filled with mushrooms in the back of her closet. obviously I am enraged, so I wait for her to get back from school, and I called the police. She was arrested, booked and released into her mother\u2019s custody. Her mother is pissed, and saying that I may have ruined the kids life for no reason, but we have tried to correct her drug abuse several times to no avail, and it has escalated. She now has a court date and can answer to the law since she doesn\u2019t take the rules in my house seriously. I doubt she\u2019ll get more than probation anyway.

My daughter has a small walk in closet that is, honestly, so messy that I don\u2019t bother to look in there too much. Because she has been passing her drug tests, I have been cutting her slack.

Our culture dictates that Peggy\u2019s father and I share the costs for their wedding. He (her father) said we should provide $10k each, a total $20k budget. I could afford this sure but This seems insane and extravagant to me. I said I would give $5k and he could give whatever he wanted. Peggy\u2019s father also put up 5k. I told my son this and he told me outright it wasn\u2019t going to be enough. He said \u201cI don\u2019t mind, I figured that me and Peggy would have to pay for some of the wedding\u201d. I asked what he meant. He said no way would they be able to do their wedding in under $10k. I said My own wedding, after haggling and deals, only came out to around $7k so I do not think this is an issue. He argued against me and said that my wedding was 40 years ago and prices were different. He outlined some prices and said the cheapest venue he could find was $5k, and food alone was going to be $2,5k. He again said he didn\u2019t mind and he thanked me for giving them money for the wedding but I honestly felt hurt that he thought we were not giving enough. I said how could food come out to 2500 dollars and he said that that was only around $25 per person. I suggested ordering pizzas or sub sandwiches but he looked at me like I was crazy. I said okay well we can just offer less for the photographer and decorator and he said that isn\u2019t how things are done. I said it is how things are done, and maybe if Peggy and him weren\u2019t so spoiled and expecting the best of the best for everything then $10k would be plenty. After I said this he just closed his eyes and thanked me for the money and basically told me to get out. I was complaining about this instance to my wife and she told me I was being a stick in the mud and it\u2019s his only wedding. My friends agree with me though. AITA?",

        "selftext": "My girlfriend (25F) and I (29M) live in NYC and there's a popular app where you buy leftover restaurant food. Restaurants advertise surprise bags at a reduced price in order to reduce foodwaste. The customer doesn't know what they're getting until they pick the food up, but the cost at least 3x lower than the normal menu price. (EG if an entree is usually $24, the restaurant is allowed to charge $8 at most for it.) These are hit or miss - sometimes you get exactly what you want at a greatly reduced price, but sometimes you get something that you otherwise wouldn't have picked from the menu. I ordered a surprise bag from a barbecue place that I was picking up on the way home yesterday. I texted my girlfriend asking if she wanted one but she said no, she wasn't in the mood for barbecue. However, there was an indian restaurant right next door that also had surprise bags available on the app, so she ordered one of them. The barbecue was $12 and the indian food was $10. When I get home I unpack the meals to see what we got. I was psyched about my bag. Since I paid $12 I knew the value had to be at least $36, but honestly the platter looked a lot more expensive. This was a hit. (Keep in mind that we live in the west village, which is the most expensive neighborhood in the most expensive city in the US, so $36 for one meal is pretty typical.) There were burnt ends, ribs, pulled pork, baked beans, potato salad, bread, onions, and pickles. My girlfriend, however, was  less lucky. Her surprise bag only had 6 different types of soup, half of them being variations on cauliflower soup. She was disappointed to say the least. She asked if we should share my barbecue and I said no, i'm hungry, I offered to buy you some already and you said no, so I'm going to devour it. She got mad and called me the asshole. I told her if she didn't want soup she should have ordered something specifically instead of using the surprise bag app. I then told her to just order something off a food delivery app. She said she didn't want to spend the money (another bit of context is I make a lot more money than her and pay all of our rent, I know she's running a bit of a lean financial picture right now.) I then tell her that if she doesn't want to pay for delivery, I'll walk to the bodega on our street and can buy her something there. (Another bit of context is that we live on a 4th floor walkup with no elevator and she broke her leg in a car accident a month ago, so it can be tough for her to get around.) She says she the grill is probably off there and all she wants is a hot meal. I tell her she has soup. Anyway, she thinks I'm the asshole. But in my defense: (1) I offered to buy her barbecue to begin with, which she declined. (2) she picked out her own food and I grabbed it for her on my way home (3) when she wasn't satisfied, I suggested two solutions (either ordering something from an app or going to a bodega) So, Reddit, AITA?",

        "selftext": "Background: My wife rarely goes out with friends (~6 times/year) and has never been very social and prefers spending time with me. I am more social, but that has declined as we have focused on our family (we have a 2 year old daughter), and I spend time with the same 3 friends once/week for games night (sometimes in person, sometimes online). I have another 3 friends that I see only once every 2 months, also for games night. If I go out my wife will tend to our daughter (I often still help with dinner/bed time, but sometimes leave earlier than this). Our daughter's bed time is 7:30pm, and she often sleeps through the night without fuss (wakes up fussing maybe 5% of the time). I always offer for my wife sleep in the next day, or something similar in exchange for me going out so that It's not a one-sided thing. Scenario: My wife made plans to spend an evening this weekend out with friends, she would be out from 6pm until late. After she made those plans, I was invited to my friends birthday thing with my second friend group, if I went I would be gone from 5pm until late. Last time I saw them was exactly one month ago. I brought this plan up with my wife as I wanted to make arrangements for a family member to take our daughter for the evening. She was irritated by this, and argued that I should stay home. I have since spoken with a family member who is happy to take our daughter at 5pm and have her stay the night and I have communicated this to my wife. I made it clear that this will not affect her plans at all, I will be responsible for dropoff and pickup of our daughter, and will not ask anything of my wife because I understand that it is rare for her to have a night out like this and so I don't want her to change her plans at all. She still thinks that I should stay home. Her arguments: - She says that since she always covers for me that I should also cover for her- She doesn't want to ask this family member to have our daughter for the night because she thinks we ask too much of them My arguments: - I am covering for her as she does not have to change her plans and doesn't have to do anything for our daughter- This family member loves watching our daughter, and my wife is often quick to agree to leave our daughter there for sleepovers plenty of other evenings out of convenience (eg: we will be there for dinner and put our daughter to sleep there so we can visit longer, then we will leave her there for the night) so I don't see why this time its too much to ask I feel like she wants me to stay home as a form of punishment for going out more frequently than she would prefer. Punishment feels too strong of a word, I don't think there is any major resentment behind this or anything, I just don't know how else to describe the feeling. So, AITA here for making plans to go out the same night my wife also already had plans to go out, even though I am covering all arrangements for our daughter for the evening? Edits: - Not sure why everyone thinks I'm planning on getting drunk, but I would not be drinking if I went to the birthday.- I would also be the on-call parent and would tend to our daughter in case of any emergency- I used the word cover to describe solo-parenting as that is the word my wife used when we spoke. Neither of us are the type of people to call parenting babysitting when it is solo.- The punishment I am referring to is about missing out on celebrating with a friend, it is NOT referring to spending time with my daughter- Just because my wife only goes out 6 times a year does not mean that is her only free time. We have 5 evenings free every week where she can either do her own thing or we can spend it together. We share the evening on-duty time equally- The vast majority (like 90% or more) of my time out is spent after my daughter is asleep, the normal routine is for both of us to do dinner/bath/bed routine, and then for me to leave afterwards- The family member I am referring to is on my wife's side, however we are very close with them and it is normal for me to talk to them directly, they feel just as much my family at this point as they are hers- The family member is also very experienced putting our daughter to bed without us being there- My daughter has her own room at this family members house, as well as another's. This is because they care for our daughter on the 3 days a week where both my wife and I work so that we don't have to pay for daycare. We are extremely lucky to have such helpful family, and the reason she has her own room/bed at these places isn't because we pawn her off there frequently, it is because she naps at these places 3 days a week, and on occasional evenings. Both family members are empty nesters who admittedly love caring for our daughter, and other young family members. We try to compensate them but they often refuse, and they even go so far as to ask to have our daughter over.",

        "selftext": "I (40f) was a single mother to my daughter, Amy (15f). I came out 3 years ago and married my wife Jenna (42f) last year. She has a daughter, Nora (13f). We all live together as I have full custody of my daughter. It was kind of hard for her to adjust to having a second mom, but they got along well. The girls have their birthdays very close, only two days apart, so we decided to have a joint birthday party for both of them, since Nora had a hard time making new friends (they moved in with us and she's very shy). Most of my family lives out of the country, so the gifts were sent a week early. It was a huge bag, with at least 20 gifts. The party was nice and we opened the bag at night once everyone left. Jenna handed out the presents as she took them out. After 12 gifts in a row just for Amy, I checked the bag and froze to see that there was only one gift for Nora, from my parents. She pretended it wasn't a big deal, but as she opened the present I saw her eyes drop. It was a $15 tumbler from Walmart. Not to sound ungrateful, but Amy's gifts were much more expensive (lots of gift cards over $100, a new phone, limited-edition Funkos, designer clothes and lots of cards wishing her a happy birthday). Needless to say, I blew up the family chat, calling out my parents, siblings, and extended family who sent gifts for not considering Nora and my parents for the cheap gift. No one took me seriously since: *It's not our duty to give gifts to someone else's kid* and *Amy deserved them, since I didn't even throw her her own birthday party,* emphasizing that Jenna and Nora are my problem, not theirs. Nora was clearly hurt, since it's not the first time my family has left her out. At night, I asked Amy to share some of the gifts with her stepsister. Not all of them, just a couple of gift cards and some of the new clothes. Amy refused. This surprised me, since she never had a problem with sharing and even though she and Nora are not BFF's, they usually get along. After asking why, Amy started crying, saying that she never wanted a joint birthday party, and that I force her to share everything with Nora. They share a room for space and I make sure they're both invited to the same parties and sleepovers, so that Nora won't be left out. If they don't invite both of them, then either of them goes. Amy stated that she at least wanted her own gifts to be hers alone. I scolded her for being selfish with her stepsister, grounded her and took a couple of the presents to give to Nora. She turned them down because she didn't want problems with Amy and it felt like pity. Since then, Amy has been cold to all of us. I just wanted my two girls to be closer with the joint party and have the same things. AITA? Clarification: Jenna and I bought gifts for the girls (their own tablets), as well as their friends. Nora also received gifts from her extended family, but they sent for Amy as well.",

Well, recently the older daughter has been disrespectful at home and staying out too late, and her grades have been slipping.

She got really upset and offended, and said we promised she'd never have to go in there or have to scoop horse poop. I said I promised it wouldn't be one of your chores, of course, but obviously a punishment is supposed to be something outside of your normal chores and something you won't like, and I thought it was perfectly fair here. She's been doing it three days now but seems to be very resentful of our broken promise, acting very disgusted, and keeps begging to get out of the rest of it. But I said I thought it's very fair and that she's overreacting.

During the time she spent on her degrees, I managed to get married and start my own family.  Diana was visiting her family and we met up for lunch. I asked her about her degree, work prospects, etc. (She did her masters in translation or interpreting or something like that) and she said she got the job but will have to move to Brussels. I told her that\u2019s crazy. If she can\u2019t find a job locally, then her degree was a waste of time if she has to move to another country.She said it\u2019s an amazing job opportunity that she couldn\u2019t get anywhere around here (apparently the job is related to EU parliament or whatever, I admit it, I lost her with all the abbreviations she was using). She again said that it\u2019s an amazing opportunity and she\u2019s excited.I asked her about the pay and she told me. I said that my husband earns that without a degree so I was right about the Easter of time and money, and she said it\u2019s  starting salary and it\u2019ll grow because the first year I saw pretty much training and being in a junior position.I again said that she could\u2019ve gotten a similar job here and wouldn\u2019t have wasted 6 years Andy instead could\u2019ve already work Andy start a family.And here\u2019s where she was rude, she said that if she was to be as unhappy as I was, she didn\u2019t want a family\u2019s. She threw in my face that apparently I\u2019m always complaining about my husband but I\u2019m criticising her, he\u2019s the best husband in the world.I told her she\u2019s ridiculous and mean and she called me an asshole, paid and left the restaurant.I to,d my friends about this and they\u2019re split in who\u2019s the asshole here so tell me, Aita for telling her the truth?",

        "selftext": "I know how the title sounds, hear me out. My [26M] gf [24F] takes forever in the bathroom. Upwards of 1 hour, sometimes closer to 2. When I playfully ribbed her about this, she'd get irritated but nothing major. 3 months ago I was playfully teasing her and she flipped out. She said she won't do anything anymore, and true to her word she hasn't shaved, waxed, or put on makeup since then, and wears her hair looking like bedhead. I told her that I got her point and would appreciate it if she resumed doing things that I also do to stay presentable. Her head hair improved a bit (although not even close to how it was before) but she still has hair on her legs and underarms, semi-unibrow etc. Now she's saying I have to pay her to resume taking care of herself, which I find crazy as I'm not her sugar daddy. Why should I pay for her to upkeep herself like she's my sugar baby? I understand that it's her body, her choice etc., but if there are any guys out there who think they would be ok if their gf had long underarm hair then you're a better man than me. I haven't pushed her to do anything, nor am I enforcing any ultimatums. If, as she says, I've been conditioned to want her to look a certain way... well, that sucks, but it's not my fault. If we broke up, she'd pay for all of this beauty stuff herself, so why should I pay? Anyone who says I'm TA, are you going to then start paying for all your girlfriends' beauty regimens, or else be fine with 100% body hair and no makeup or hair care ever? Be honest with yourselves. **Gf's side:** He keeps being a dick about how long I would take in the bathroom, so as he said, I quit things he didn't even realize I was doing. No makeup, no shaving/waxing, no brows, no waxing those moustache hairs, I have curly frizzy hair so I stopped using product or straightening/curling with an iron, no mani/pedi, no touching up or redoing my highlights. Do I look like a beast? Sure. Am I a comfy, smug beast? Hell yes. He rightfully pointed out that he takes care of himself for me (by shaving his beard and cutting his hair), so I obligingly waxed my upper lip and got a haircut. I'm continuing to do this whole thing because 1) it's so much less effort for me, 2) it's way cheaper, and 3) now that I stopped, I feel like... why do I ever have to do all this shit. It's unfair. And if I have to do it because both of us have been conditioned to see me doing these things as the basic standards for a woman, then he should pay half the costs. I conservatively spend at least $1k a year on brows, shaving supplies, hair products, highlights, haircuts, and makeup. Conservatively. He should have to pay me at least half if he wants me to do it, and extra for painful things like bikini waxes if he wants me to do them again. Otherwise it's not fair. **Both:** We love each other a lot and aren't actually fighting. We recognized that we're having a difference in opinion, and since neither has been able to sway the other we came to the court of public opinion. **EDIT (from bf):** alright, I'm the asshole. You know, it wasn't even the people saying I *was* the asshole that convinced me so much as the people saying I wasn't. No way in hell do I want to hold the same opinion as some of you, so if you think I'm not TA then I definitely am. My girlfriend not wanting to *remove body hair* is not the same as me walking around without showering, in stained shirts and greasy hair. Jesus. The amount of sexist pigs that personally reached out to assure me that I'm not TA and the Reddit commenters are comprised of libtards, cucks, feminazis, etc... man. I think it's reasonable to say that I'm allowed to no longer be attracted to her physically after this, and in that case I would either pay up or we break up. However, luckily, I am still very much into her. I would *highly prefer* the lack of body hair, but it's far from a dealbreaker and I think those who pointed out that I should be trying to unlearn these standards are correct. As I said before, this was never a fight. And for all of you calling my gf a fugly whatever and telling me I can do much better, she's always hot as fuck, have fun in your mom's basement tonight. **EDIT 2 (from gf):** Thank you, Reddit, for knocking some sense into this mans. He let me shave his legs. He said he feels like a dolphin. I've decided his genuine contrition and heartfelt apologizing is enough for me and will resume shaving my pits for him, and doing my brows and hair (I didn't spend years subscribed to r/curly only to let my hair turn into a shitshow now)",

My daughter (16) has a thing for baking, she bakes cakes and some (I said some not all!) sweets and makes money out of it by selling her work to relatives, friends and supposedly us! My husband's (Her stepdad) 45th birthday took place days ago. He asked my daughter to bake him the birthday cake and she agreed. I told him about paying her to which he responded with pfff pay her? Get outta here, I'm her dad!. I insisted seeing she's a yes person and a people's pleaser so won't outright demand the money from him. He said he'd pay but days went by and he didn't pay her a cent.  I decided to go ahead and sell the wrist watch I bought him as his birthday cake and pay her for her. He foubd out and went off on me. I told him he had rnough time and shouldve paid her seven before he recieved the cake. He said that I was teaching her to treat familial relationship as transactional and raiding her to be materialistic. I explained the time, effort and even money she put towards making the cake but he lashed out verbally calling me an asshlle for making this move and for enabling my daughter to expect so much from family that she's supposed to help with nothing in return. He's furious and told almost the whole family about how I took back his birthday gift and returned it. I got enough shame from family members to begin to think that I might be an asshole for how I dealt with this. AITA? Ya'll, my daughter did want and expect to be paid. If she intended for it to be for free then I would have kept my mouth shut. And also the wristwatch idn't expensive. I kept the rest of the money after giving my daughter her share.",

        "selftext": "I had a party at my house last night. I have an antique slot machine from the 1940s that is in absolutely spotless and working condition in my living room. My step grandma was a show girl she she got it while dating a count room guy prior to meeting my grandpa. Over the years people have played it and maybe won a few quarters here and there. Maybe a max of $50 at a time. As far as I know the jackpot was never hit on it so however it works there was probably about $700 in the jackpot reserve that had built up over the years. I\u2019d never bothered to have it cleaned out since it just seemed like a fun novelty.  Well a friend\u2019s friend hit the jackpot last night. I was fucking floored when he legit thought he could keep my ~$700. His case was hed been playing with his own money and I would have kept his quarters. My argument  was I\u2019d be happy to give him his quarters back if he\u2019d asked but I\u2019m not a casino and while I\u2019m not destitute, I can\u2019t afford to give someone $700. Argument caused the party to wind down and one of my best guy friends basically told the guy he\u2019d be in real shit if he tried to leave with the money but the guy left threatening to come back with the cops and sue me in small claims court. I have no idea if that was realistic but no cops came back.  So was I the asshole for nor letting him keep the money? Edit: sorry guys I can't answer such witticisms as why are you so shity? because I've been banned. Edit2: wow since I\u2019m a \u201cbaby gangster\u201d who has been running an \u201cillegal gaming operation\u201d (both things that have been said) I might as well just go whole hog and start running guns and pimping underage Andean alpacas to people who would pay for the privilege. I\u2019m really that bad? I just thought I had a cool thing my step grandma got by banging a dude from the count room. Edit3: gotta address this one directly: >If this was really last night, give it a week or a month and see how many friends, especially mutual friends, are no longer talking to you. Forget our votes, listen to those. Also forget small claims, you need to worry more about hearing from your state's gambling commission. If the moderators allow me to update, I will ABSOLUTELY update and tell you how many friends I\u2019ve lost. Almost everyone  (including the friend that brought the \u201cwinner\u201d thought he was being a total asshole for the way he was down on his hands and knees scooping up quarters off the floor to put in his pockets. And he was lying about much he put into the machine too (he said $75\u2013who the fuck walks around, nuch less even get $75 in quarters\u2014when going to a party at a strangers house). In addition, I will gladly, gladly call our state gaming commission (AZ) and ask what trouble I might be in. I will also update on that when I can. People CAN\u2019T be this dramatic in real life...I\u2019m a ducking instagram influencer for my job, the phoniest, most vapid, saddest job a person can have right now and I\u2019m still blown away by some of these comments. Call me YTA all you like, but don\u2019t be stupid and claim to have knowledge you don\u2019t  in the process. Edit4: well I was banned for joking around, other people have bad posts calling me a cunt up for over an hour.  Makes INFO hard but I\u2019ll try to explain my thinking on the money in the machine and why I can\u2019t \u201cafford\u201d to give it to him.  Say you have a change jar, has $100 in it. Your good friend asks to borrow $25, for parking, you'd say yes right? Another friend says wow, that\u2019s cool I have $1.25 in my pocket, can I donate to your change jar? You\u2019d say yes. Now let\u2019s say a guy you\u2019ve never met says \u201chey I just put .80 into your change jar, now I\u2019m taking the whole thing.\u201d You would say no. It\u2019s how I\u2019ve always seen the slot machine as huge change jar for all my close friends to use. I\u2019ve given people quarters to play, I\u2019ve taken a quarter here and there from people who wanted to see it work. I\u2019ve taken in maybe $100 over five years. Maybe. That\u2019s a nickel a day. that\u2019s not a freaking illegal gambling operation. Edit5: a good question: >INFO Did he explicitly ask if he was allowed to play it, and keep what he wins? If no then he played it without permission, you aren't running a casino. No he did not, the first time I ever saw or spoke to him was when he was on his hands and knees picking quarters up off the floor slamming them his pockets.  I don't mind if people play it, I even give people quarters to play it (since no one has change anymore) but he did not ask. Edit6: another good question >Also, need more info. You stated that other guests have won small jackpots in the past (max $50). Did you let them keep it? If so, why are you making a double-standard here? I would have let him keep $50-100 (he certainly got away with some in his pockets) but he was such an asshole right away that he didn't give me the chance to come to any sort of deal. Most everyone at the party just wanted him gone. I do feel bad and maybe my guilt over the apparent double standard is why I'm asking here. But I do feel as though had he been even slightly cool and not threaten cops or lawsuits I wouldn't have been backed into a corner. Edit7:  >INFOWe need to know where the money came from. Did the money in the machine come from YOU putting it in or playing the machine So this is all guess work based on what my grandma said the jackpot could hold (there's a window that shows the coins in rhe jackpot, the space behind is about the size of a big shoe box). She said it gets full at $800. It was more than half when she and my grandpa gave it to me, I always guessed $500. In five years it's now 7/8ths full. I play it from to time to time so I'd say $100 of that is mine and $100 is friends. I think the jackpot and normal pay outs come from different boxes so last night was the last night I've ever seen that window empty. I know nothing of the machine or how it works or how to change settings so I may be so wrong and a slot machine nerd could correct me if I'm way off base. Edit8: this is the best yta take so far and I can't let it get buried. > I really hope you get into some serious legal trouble and then you\u2019ll wish all you lost was several hundred and not thousands including jail time. Edit9 (at 5:45am, gotta work): you guys are really cracking me up. I love the comments that say your edits make you YTA! Alone. Where did the money come from btw?  I truly can accept the YTA votes but so freaking many of them have basic facts wrong. 1. I wasn't profiting off this machine. I've literally never opened it up and taken a single coin out. 2. I can't afford to give a random dude $700. I don't need it now, but I have savings account I don't need it now either but I might some day. And now I've found out that some of the quarters that my grandma had from the 50s or 60s might actually be silver. So good thing I hung onto them right ? (I can't wait for the you're a stupid thot rationalizations to come from this one).  3. I never cleaned it out because honestly I like the way it looked with the coins in the window. This thing is enourmous and built with casino security in mind so it was in fact, a great piggy bank.  4. Some nice NTAs have suggested I have a bowl of quarters a for people to play. I actually in effect did that because 80% the time people who wanted to play didn't have change (I got it five years ago) so I always had quarters around, maybe just not right by the machine.  5. As an example, Over the years it's mostly friends kids who want to play. I had a very precocious 9 year old once come over with his $20 of money truly expecting to get the jackpot. He was heartbroken when he didn't win (I might have given it to him since he was so cute) but I gave him a $20 silver certificate my step grandma had given me (acquired ny dubious means no doubt) and that kid was thrilled. so I always, always give people money back if they ask. I never intended to profit off the machine. No one has ever made a big deal of it before (save the 9 year old). Edit10: this dude wins the comments, for all time: >I bet u look like jared fogle or some shit \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 Edit 11: sooooo the plot thickens, thank you to some very helpful people who own slot machines who DM'ed who were also able to suggest experts in my area, I was able to call a local person who works on antique slot machines. My slot machine is highly customized but it's based around a pretty well known model from that era (don't want to say exactly because only a few of them exist anymore) and he said I could tell right away if the machine was broken or had been tampered with. In my very, very, very amateur job of checking it over it does appear that this little piece is either broken or misplaced. So it looks like this piece of shit guest actually broke my machine to steal my money. There wasn't a jackpot at all. I don't have confirmation of this until the repair guy is able to come later this week but it looks like that's what happened. The guy said there's an outside chance that if that piece was broken or tampered with that it was an accident but he wouldn't bet on it.  I still don't care if I'm YTA till the cows come home, posting here has probably allowed me to get to the bottom of this. And fuck that guy. Edit 12: well the amazing and level headed moderators of this sub just ever so politely informed me that I will not be allowed to update this post. So the short story is the winner almost certainly was hitting the machine and caused the jackpot to spill out. So had I been a real casino I would have enacted the malfunction voids all pays and plays clause. So yeah, I was totally in the right. Fuck this sub. Fuck the moderators. And fuck those of you on your stupid high horse. Most of you however were cool.",

        "selftext": " My M30 brother in law M20 Sean moved in with me and his sister after my father in law passed away few months ago. He is the private type and keeps to himself. He goes out and never say where he's going or how long he'll be out, eats at random times during the day, wears earpuds while me and the kids are sitting with him. See, all of these are uncool behaviors and a bad influence on my children. I've already talked to Sean about certain house rules I have and how he was violating them maybe because he didn't but now he knows and still nothing's changed. Last night, he came home late at around 10pm. I wasn't thrilled with that because he knew the rules but he said that he was an adult and I shouldn't be policing him but it's not about that, it's about the fact that he's repeatedly disrespected the homeowner and the rules...So I told him this: If he won't respect the rules which are: Being home at 8, not eating at random times, and not using his electronics just like my kids aren't allowed when the family is gathered to spend time together. He ranted about how he wasn't a child, my child and called me unreasonable to treat him this way just because he lives under my roof, I told him it's not hard to show respect really but my wife went off asking what was wrong with me to be giving Sean who's still grieving, ultimatums and treating him like a child. I explained to her that I'm just making sure the kids won't be influenced by her brother's reckless behavior and she laughed asking if I think Sean being on his phone was reckless but that is besides the point. She called me a control freak and told me to get off her brother's back and leave him alone. I replied that she's just saying this because he's her brother but she said I overstepped and should back off and stop trying to control her adult brother. I asked her if she was happy with him coming home late and she said she was sick of arguing then went upstairs. AITA here?",

        "selftext": "Throwaway account. I (40F) am significantly older than my sister, 25F. As such, after she was born, I was repeatedly looked over and parentified by my parents in favor of her. Examples of this include giving my old clothes and toys to her (without my permission), rather than preserving them as a keepsake of my childhood. In short, my inner child has had to do a lot of healing over the years. I am low contact with my parents and sister, but apparently she is engaged and wants me to be a part of the wedding party. Now, I am not comfortable around children of any age. It is part of my trauma; being around them for me comes with a sense of responsibility that reminds me of the neglect I suffered at the hands of my family. My sister knows this, so I assumed with her asking me to be in the wedding, that the wedding would be childfree. During a discussion, she mentioned her fianc\u00e9\u2019s best friend\u2019s daughter would be serving as flower girl and our cousin\u2019s son would be ring bearer. I reminded her that I would not be comfortable around children and expressed my disappointment that she would invite me to be in a wedding that is not childfree. She looked sad for a second and told me that there were many young children and families that are close to her and her fiance and the day would feel \u201cincomplete\u201d without them, and if I really wasn\u2019t comfortable around children to that extent, she would understand if I am unable to attend. I was shocked that she would uninvite me in the favor of random kids and it reminded me of being thrown aside in favor of her when we were young, so I left to collect myself. I attempted to ask my parents to talk some sense into her but, surprise, surprise, they took her side. At this point, I was deeply hurt and needed an outlet, so I did something that might make me TA. I am friends with some other family members on facebook, and I made a post about how my sister was kicking me out of the wedding and that my parents were taking her side, all because of the trauma that they contributed to themselves. I didn\u2019t go into detail because I didn\u2019t think it was anyone else\u2019s business, I just wanted to vent. Now, people are apparently refusing to go to my sister\u2019s wedding unless I am reinstated as part of the wedding. She and my parents are begging me to come but still refusing to budge on the children being there, so it doesn\u2019t make much of a difference to me. I do feel bad because I didn\u2019t know that our family would refuse to come but I cannot go to an event that has that many children running around or retract my statement because I don\u2019t want the family to think I lied. AITA for refusing to go? EDIT: for those of you suggesting therapy, I am in therapy. My therapist is incredible and helped me realize how heavily my past has affected me. I have yet to discuss the facebook post with her, but we'll see what she has to say.",

        "selftext": "My future SIL is marrying my brother next summer and they are planning to have a child free wedding. I have about 3 other sisters and we all have kids as do most of my cousins at this point. Our family is kinda spread out over the country and my brother/SIL\u2019s wedding is out of state for most of us. Once I found out they wanted to make it childfree I began to lose interest in going to the wedding. I don\u2019t want to be away from my kids for a couple of days and it is just a hassle to find them living arrangements for when my husband and I are gone - especially since most of our adult family members will be at the wedding. We\u2019d have to leave the kids with some friends. However, I get that it is her wedding and her decision so I just declined to go stating that I don\u2019t want to leave my kids alone without any family to watch them. After I dropped out, my other sisters got the courage to drop out as well as they also have toddlers they didn\u2019t wan\u2019t to leave behind for a couple of days. Then my cousins began declining to come as well. Now it has become a huge deal in the family and caused a lot of drama. My brother has called me and yelled at me saying that I was the one who caused all the problems. I was firm when I told him I wasn\u2019t going to his wedding unless I could bring my kids and that all our sisters/cousins pretty much felt the same way. My parents who are paying for half of their wedding are also pissed that so many family members on our side aren\u2019t coming, they were already somewhat against the idea of a childfree wedding in the first place and have now started pressuring SIL to not make it childfree. My SIL refuses to meet in the middle and says the wedding will remain childfree, but she\u2019s also mad at all of us for not coming. She also still expects my parents to help pay for it, which I doubt they\u2019ll do at this point lol. I\u2019m fine with her having a childfree wedding, I just don\u2019t want to be a part of it if it means being away from my kids for days. AITA Edit: People keep asking why I'm mostly talking about my SIL and not my brother in the post. I know for a fact my brother was okay with having kids at the wedding, its the norm in our family and he loves his nieces/nephews. It's my SIL who wants this to be a childfree thing against the wishes of like 95% of our family and still have my parents foot the bill. My brother is just supporting her to make her happy. Edit: She has an entire 4 day itinerary planned with like 6 events that she expects to all be childfree. Are all of us with toddlers and kids supposed to swing back and forth from hiding our kids in hotels with random sitters to all the wedding activities just to keep my psycho SIL happy? And then PAY for it because she sure AF won't since our kids are our problems as she's stated to my face. ",

        "selftext": "My son is 18, He is going to be attending community college and is living with me, my husband and his 2 younger half sisters. The other day I found out that he found and accepted a job without telling me. I was upset with him about it and the reason for that is that first of all, he should've told me since we live in the same house and also, and more importantly now I'm left without someone to stay with the girls from 3 to 8 where my shift start-ends. my son is usually the one to stay home with the girls and his new job is during these hours so one way or another we are impacted. He told me his friend found him this job and it just happened - but I don't think it did because he knew he had to give up staying with his sisters while I work. my husband travels most of the time (he's a pilot) and paid child care is a no for me. My son said I shouldn't be surprised by him trying to work to save money to be able to pay for himself but that is just absurd since he literally lives with us without having to pay for anything except for his own entertainment. He said he needed the job and he wasn't reallistically going to stay and watch his sisters for days on end especially he doesn't get paid for it. We kept arguing and my husband got involved and he too was upset saying that my son had no respect for us. my son basically had a like it or not attitude with us and kept refusing to discuss this wirh us saying we have no right to be upset with him and should just accept it. but I'm just...I think that he's being inconsiderate of my husband's and I's struggle to provide for the family as a whole. this should mean something to him but he acted selfishly. ETA okay, it seems that I did not mention the reason why the babysitter option isn't ideal and is because my daughters don't want a babysitter. they're both dealing with some issues and are unconfortable being with a stranger at home. besides that my son decided to stay with them and we didn't ask him or anything. ETA Okay, some of you here are implying or suggesting that I'm making my son to be the girls' babysitter but that is in fact not true. He doesn't do much for them, just stays home with them while he studies or plays video games. He adores his sisters and only stays with them when he wants to. otherwise we wouldn't force him. Also, my husband said the girls are too young for therapy and I agree with him on that.",

        "selftext": "My wife and I have a six month old baby girl. She's mostly a SAHM, she works two half days a week and her sister watches the baby. I work full time and go to school one day a week. We've always had an arrangement where she takes care of the household duties (cooking, cleaning, and now baby care) while I happily support her monetarily. Honestly, we are both living our dream life and my wife does an absolutely spectacular job taking care of me and our little one. On the weekends, we share baby duty. We usually make sure each of us gets our own alone time to do whatever we want. However, our girl has hit a bit of a sleep regression, waking up every two hours--since my wife breast feeds, she's always taken care of the baby full time overnight. She's a light sleeper and unfortunately has insomnia, whereas I am a deep sleeper and wouldn't wake up for baby cries anyways . Recently my wife has been asking me to wake up with the baby both days on the weekends so she can get an extra hour of sleep. Baby wakes up around 7am. I get the baby dressed and take over for that hour. But sometimes, I want to be the one that gets to sleep in an extra hour. I brought this up to her and she says while she's happy to let me nap during the day, she really needs that hour bc she can't nap like I can. We got into an argument about it, and she said I'm being very insensitive when I know she is very exhausted and cant nap during the day and she struggles going back to sleep every time the baby wakes up. But I'm exhausted too, work wears me out, and school days are long... and I sometimes want the hour in the morning. I don't want to spend my off time napping, I want to play videogames and chill out. I've gotten mixed opinions on who is in the wrong here, or if there even is anyone in the wrong. AITA for asking us to share mornings off for sleep?",

Came back unprompted & hugged her. She said \u201coh good bc I was going to be sad\u201d. W my fianc\u00e9\u2019s, aunt\u2019s &bestfriend\u2019s edits, I sent her this: (Summed up):\u201cWe\u2019re teaching 3yo that he\u2019s in control of his own body & self-defined boundaries regardless of how it makes someone feel. If he\u2019s trying to make someone upset on purpose, that\u2019s a different story. We don\u2019t want him to go against his boundaries to make someone feel better. I\u2019m sure you just want to show he\u2019s important to you but we\u2019d appreciate it if you could show it in a different way.\u201d FMIL: \u201cOP, I\u2019d appreciate you not sending me these kinds of messages and we have these conversations in person. Thank you\u201d OP: \u201cI don\u2019t really see a difference to be honest. I would\u2019ve said the same things in person. I didn\u2019t see this topic as one that needs to be discussed too much. If you have a response I\u2019m obviously open to hearing it, but it won\u2019t change the fact that saying things that could make my kids feel guilty & responsible for other\u2019s feelings will be accepted. Again, you can show that you care for the boys but not in ways that make them feel bad.\u201d FMIL: \u201cBc having adult conversation via text I believe are pretty cowardess. When you address me or any other adult, via text, it\u2019s not really appropriate, so I will end this conversation with if you can't talk things over with me instead of telling me what not to do then that in itself is a problem. So I'm done.\u201d OP: \u201cAgain, I would say the same words to you in person, nothing cowardess about the method I choose to say these words. The reason I didn\u2019t see it made sense to do it in person is bc I\u2019m essentially asking you a favor & it\u2019s your choice to acknowledge it or not. I wasn\u2019t looking for a debate about it, just asking that you please not make certain comments to my babies.\u201d I\u2019m alright if she\u2019d prefer me to discuss something like this in person, but why ignore my initial message? Seems like blameshifting/diverting to me. She then went to my fianc\u00e9 & txted him \u201cso by now I\u2019m sure \u201cOP\u201d told you she was messaging me, if you guys have something you need to say to me just say it\u201d. They had a 30min phone call & my fianc\u00e9 told me she said: - she\u2019s already distanced herself from coming over & she\u2019ll distance herself more if she has to- it\u2019s not something she was doing intentionally (I never said it was intentional, just bringing her attention to this and potential repercussions) Chose to message her bc I\u2019m HORRIBLE at having deep/stressful convos in person (I have ADHD so can\u2019t process what I want to say & what other person is said & formulate responses,etc) also this is a boundary so not rly up for discussion or debate.

        "selftext": "This situation is a bit of a mess. I'll just mention the relevent conflict at hand. So My wife Liz and I have been married for 7 years. we have preschool age kids, and because we currently live in the same city as my parents. Mom would take the kids while my wife and I work. Liz is the one with a much larger income, she got an even better job opportunity that is requiring us to move to another city. I agreed since I could easily find a job in my field in the city we're moving to. but after my family heard we were selling the house to move, hell broke loose. Sunday, mom and Liz got into a huge fight because Liz told mom we'll move away and hire a babysitter for the kids so she's no longer needed. mom said she doesn't want her grandkids moving away, even said we should let the kids live at her house while we move. Liz laughed at her and mom lost it basically saying that Liz was an ungrateful witch and that her grandkids moving will only happen over her dead body. they began exchanging harsher words and Liz snapped and told mom to butt out of private matters that don't concern her. and said that she had no right to decide things regarding the kids. Mom firmly told her she was dead wrong and proceeded to tell her that she, as an involved grandmother, knows her rights and she will be taking Liz and me to court to ensure she still gets to see her grankids. Liz was in shock, she looked to the left and saw me sitting there not saying or doing anything. She told me to check my mom but I told her she was being unfair to mom and that mom had to feel upset because she will no longer be able to see her grandchildren - I honestly told Liz that she was a bit selfish to not consider my mom's feelings and her crucial presence in the kids life first. Liz started arguing with me saying she couldn't believe I didn't stand behind her and defend her after hearing mom saying she'd get the court involved. I said mom was upset and can not be blamed for her reaction. Liz started yelling at me calling me unsupportive and an enabler then went home with the kids, insisting my family is MY problem and I should handle it although this whole moving thing was her idea. Situation hasn't been resolved and Liz and mom are getting more intense in their fights. I choose to stay out of it because both have valid arguments but Liz has called me awful for not siding with her after seeing how mom spoke to her and being okay with the fact that mom was willing to cause us issues in court. AITA? I get that Liz wants my support but I feel like mom has been punished through no fault of her own after being a loving grandmother to my kids.",

        "selftext": "My son (24M) and his girlfriend (24F) have only been together for 6 months, and she is apparently 4 months pregnant with his baby. They have actually been friends since high school, and so my husband and I have known her for a few years as well.  She is a lovely girl, but honestly she is not someone I had hoped would be the mother to my first grandchild. First of all, she is a recovering drug addict and alcoholic, and while she says she has been clean for 3 years, a relapse is always possible. She only finished high school with her GED, and she now works as a waitress full time. Her parents died years ago, so she is largely on her own. Our family is considerably better off, and my son is joining his father's business, meaning his salary will be quite high and will only continue to grow.  Since my son first told us she is pregnant, it can't escape my mind that he may not really he the father, and that she picked him out of potential others because he would be the best in terms of support.  My son is pushing us to help her with some of her pregnancy expenses, and I told him we would under the condition that she get a paternity test first. He completely blew up at that, accusing us of disliking her (untrue) and not wanting to he grandparents (also untrue). He says he loves her and trusts her and that he can't wait to meet his baby. I get that, but I think he's being idealistic. If he wants our support, we want a paternity test first. If the baby is truly his then we would be happy to welcome her into our family and we would be happy to help her out. AITA? Edit: there are 7k replies to this post, and over 200 private messages in my inbox that I can't reply to. It's a pretty even mix of YTA and NTA, so clearly the only thing everyone can agree with is that it's complicated. I've gotten messages to kill myself, I've gotten messages calling my son an idiot, and I have gotten messages from the MGTOW subreddit telling me that the girlfriend is clearly a lying sociopath. I have also gotten a lot of messages from men who found out their child wasn't theirs after several years, who wish they had found out sooner.  It's a lot to read, and a lot to think about. Many people have called out my attitude towards this girl and I'll be honest, it is making me think.",

She is a freshman and has been with her boyfriend Steve for 3 years. Steve is really a great kid, but since money is a bit tighter in his family, he is doing 2 years at junior college while working to save up for the school my daughter attends. We have never taken him on a trip, but since he says money is right, we decided to bring him with on our visit to see our daughter. He visited her once on his own back in the fall, but due to his finances he wouldn\u2019t be able to afford another trip this school year. He was over the moon when we invited him.  We don\u2019t want him to pay for a single thing. His flight, his hotel room (he will be sharing with our son, they get along really well) and his food and drink will all be paid for by us. And really we are glad to do it. We\u2019ve also never really had a disagreement with Steve until now.  When speaking to my daughter about plans, the hotel came up. This is when I found out that my daughters dorm roommate is out of town that weekend. And she plans to have Steve stay in her dorm with her while we visit. I told her absolutely not. I said what they do when we aren\u2019t there is their business, but since we are going to be there and funding this whole trip, he will be staying at the hotel. Call my husband and I old school, or traditionalists, but we are Christians. And the idea of them staying together on our visit makes us uncomfortable. We think we are being rather generous to take him in the first place.  The word got back to Steve and he actually called me and asked why he couldn\u2019t stay with our daughter. I explained my reasons above and he got irate. He tried to pull the \u201cadult\u201d card. I said Steve,  here is the deal. If you wanna stay with her, that\u2019s fine. You will still be welcome to tag along with our family. But there will be separate checks on every meal. And he could figure out his own way there. He said we know he can\u2019t afford that. And I said all we ask is that you sleep at the hotel. He agreed but now my daughter is saying we embarrassed him and he\u2019s thinking of not coming.",

I was working in a bar to make money while I explored his city.  When I got pregnant he lost interest really quickly. I understood but I am pro choice. And I chose not to terminate.  I went home and had my son. I also made sure to get child support. He could afford it. He did fight it though. I had to prove paternity and everything.  Through that his parents found out. They are well off. They have met my son and they truly do seem to love him. They have provided gifts for his birthday and Christmas. They helped me with extra money so I could complete my university without going into debt. They have taken us on vacation with them so they could spend time with him. They aren't my biggest fans but we are cordial to each other.  Three months ago my son's father passed away. He got drunk at his bachelor party, tripped on the sidewalk, and hit his head. And that was all she wrote.  My son and I attended the funeral. We spent a week in that city so his grandparents could see him.  They approached me with an offer. They had no other children or grandchildren. Their son was only 28 so he had lots of time to provide them legitimate kids (they did not say this I'm just assuming) so they never thought about my son's name.  They said that if I changed his surname to theirs legally they would make him their primary heir. I think this is dumb. He is their only grandchild and they would deny him an inheritance because of his last name?  I said I would consider it, to be polite, and have left it at that. I actually have a pretty good life as it is. My family has been very supportive. And because of the whole court thing my son's father had to have life insurance with him as the beneficiary.  Would it be nice for my kid to get a big sum of money. Yes. Do I want him to have the surname of a man who didn't want him, see him, or love him? No.  I have been talking to my family about it and a few of them think I'm being an asshole for giving up.this kind of money for my son. It is generational wealth and I'm making the decision based on emotion. I think they are assholes for thinking money is the only thing that matters.  I think I will tell my son's grandparents that they can talk to him about it when he is 16. He will be old enough to understand the implications but young enough not to be tied professionally to his last name.",

However, I did NOT ask for this and honestly I freaking hate the color as it does not match anything in my place and it's also too big. I gave it to my friend who liked it and was moving to a different state. My boyfriend then got me a cute black standmixer that fit into my apartment a lot better so that's what I have. My dad was over last night and he noticed that the grey standmixer was gone and replaced by the black one. He asked where it was and I told him the truth (namely, that I thought the grey was ugly so I gave it to my friend and my boyfriend got me the black one instead). My dad was shocked and said the grey standmixer had cost a lot and that he thought I would have liked it so that's why he gave it to me as a present. Maybe here's where I'm the AH: I said if he would have been more observant, he would have known that I absolutely hate the color grey (it's my least favorite color) and everyone in my life who knows me knows that. I honestly wasn't trying to be rude, I was just stating a fact. But my mom called me today and told me I really hurt my dad and need to apologize for throwing away a thoughtful birthday gift my dad had put a lot of money and thought into. I don't think that's necessary, I think after my dad gave me the standmixer, it became mine and I could do anything with it. And I didn't throw it away, I gave it to a friend. So AITA? edit: okay so clearly I'm the asshole. I'll apologize to my dad. I didn't think it was such a big deal. But clearly I'm wrong. To explain some things: 1) I didn't say the observant comment to hurt him, he kept saying he picked out grey because it matches everything (which it does not) so that's why I elaborated on me hating grey 2) literally everyone I'm close with (except my dad I guess) knows I HATE grey. It's almost a running joke at this point 3) my friend is really into cooking/baking and I wanted to give her a moving-away gift, she's not just some rando person I gave it to",

I apologized and said the most convenient thing for me was to come here with Peanut.  He told me to fuck off and not to be a lazy pet owner. Then he stormed off. It was a bit of a scene.

The other day my 12 yo stepson fell off the stairs and injured his anckle, his dad and I had to get him to the hospital and needed someone to stay with the kids while we were there. My boyfriend told my son to skip workday and stay with and watch his stepbrothers. When we returned, My son asked my boyfriend to pay him for babysitting his kids I admit my son doesn't have the best relationship with his stepdad or stepsiblings but My boyfriend and I were shocked by this. My son explained that he had to skip a workday which cost him to lose money and asked my boyfriend to pay him for his time. My boyfriend scolded him harshly and told him that staying home with his stepbrothers isn't babysitting and he deserves no money for it. plus that skipping one day of work won't do much harm. but my son disagreed and kept arguing with my boyfriend saying his stepbrothers aren't his responsibility. My boyfriend ended up punishing him and taking away all his electronics as well as cancelling his birthday months away. My son fought back talking about how unfair this was and asked me to get involved. I sided with my boyfriend because I really did not appreciate how my son used this family emergency to his advantage and thought he'd get money out of helping family out. My son didn't like where I stood in this conflict and accused me of favoring my stepkids to stay on my boyfriend's good side while ignoring the mistreatment towards him. I cut the argument and he's become silent eversince. even refused to eat with us or sit with us. AITA for agreeing with my boyfriend to punish my son?",

She chose a seafood restaurant that we'd never been to. In looking over the menu I saw that the vast majority of the dishes contained shellfish. There were a few fish entrees, as well as some surf and turf. But there were only a couple of non-seafood dishes. Our son (15m) is deathly allergic to shellfish. He also can't stand fish. There were only a couple of dishes there that he could actually eat. I didn't want to take him there because I knew that he wouldn't really enjoy his meal and I was worried about cross contamination. I told my daughter that this restaurant wouldn't work and that she would have to pick out a different one. My son said that he would be fine just staying home; that we could use the money that we would have spent on his meal to just order him a pizza instead. My husband also insisted that since it was our daughter's birthday that she should be able to choose the restaurant, and that our son would be fine home alone with pizza and videogames. But here's the thing; we can only afford to go out as a family every so often. When we splurge on a restaurant meal, I want BOTH of our children there. I insisted and my daughter chose a different place and we had a nice meal AS A FAMILY. But she is still a little salty that she didn't get to have her first choice of restaurants. Most people I've asked say I'm wrong. But, again, we can only afford to go out every so often. Is it so wrong that I wanted to do it as a family? My daughter still had a nice birthday meal. ",

It was an entire month of her leaving the house right after getting home from work, spending some time with the cat, then going straight to her boyfriend\u2019s. Most nights she doesn\u2019t even sleep here.  She was starting to leave when i asked her if she was going to her boyfriend\u2019s. She said yes, then grabbed her keys. I stopped her and said we really needed to talk about her constantly at her boyfriend\u2019s. She said \u201cwhat is there to talk about?\u201d I told her that I didn\u2019t appreciate her going there almost everyday if she was going to live here and that there needs to be boundaries.  My friend said how she is there every night that she has her kid, and that she only leaves when she doesnt because that\u2019s the only time she can see him. She stated that she would invite him here but she wants to be courteous to myself and my son, so she just goes over there and ends up staying the night so that she isn\u2019t coming through the door very late when my son is sleeping. She asked if this was about her leaving the cat there some days, and mentioned that this was not something I told her would be an issue when establishing house rules I told her it wasn\u2019t about the cat, it was about her never or hardly being here for days at a time, when she lives here. She said she wasn\u2019t gonna just not see her boyfriend and didn\u2019t understand the issue then walked away. This made me feel confused and now i\u2019m wondering if i might be wrong? AITA?

To make sure we gave everyone enough time we got invitations ready 2 weeks in advance and I had my son pass them out Friday. We invited every one in his class (he goes to a small private school so there were only 15 kids to invite). Except for one child well call david.  The school my son goes to has a program for special needs kids where they are put into a normal class once a week. David is a high functioning autistic child who was put in my sons class to help him socialize and to help the other kids learn to not discriminate against special needs people. From what I know about him and his mother they are just doing their best, and I have nothing against either of them. However, there have been incidents with david before. Last year through friends I had heard that David had a meltdown at another party he was invited to. I don't know if I believe it but parents who were there say that it was because he wanted to open presents like the birthday boy and when told no freaked out. There are other logistical problems as well (The party will be in a loud arcade) so in the end I decided to not invite david.  Well, after my son passed the invitations word spread around that we had excluded the special needs child in his class. This got back to davids mother who called me last night and confronted me about this. She told me that I am awful for excluding her son and that i'm teaching my son to discriminate. When I brought up the logistics and the past incident she told me that i'm an asshole for assuming what her son can and cant do before hanging up. I woke up this morning to a passive aggressive post by her and many other parents are siding with her.  I just want my son to have a good party and didn't mean anything by this. AITA?",

Note that it was purchased solely by me, my wife did not help save for it (I started saving for it before I even met here) and it's in my name. When my parents threw us a party for this happy ocassion, mom asked for a copy of the key in case of an emergency. I let her have it which made my wife upset. She didn't say anything at the time but she waited til we were alone and started arguing with me saying I shouldn't have let my mother have a copy of the key. I said why?! Since my mother is known to respect privacy and is a very trusted member in the family. She said that she does not feel comfortable with the idea of someone else, who's not a resident to have a copy of the key. She also brought up how my mother didn't pay a penny towards the house so this should disqualify her from getting the key. I said it was not a big deal but she kept presisting saying I need to take the key back. Quite frankly, this had me fuming. I pointed out that I'm the one who bought the house and it's my decision to decide who gets to have a copy of the key end of story. She screamed at me saying that technically she did contribute towards the house savings back when she used to pay for our rent and daily expenses while I saved money. I told her that she was acting as if I put my mom's name on the title which's ridiculous but she said that I have no respect for her opiniins and keep undermining her input. We've been going back and forth on it since then. She's now letting me know that if I don't take the key back then she'll do it herself. I think she's being irrational and unreasonable acting like that over a copy of the house key. This decision I made could save us in case of an emergency but she kept downplaying it. E.T.A I think it's crucial to mention that there's no conflict between my mother and my wife. They're on near perfect terms, alright? I thought that I've already established that above.",

I recently got back to work and since I work nightshifts, I had to get the kids a babysitter (they're at school during the day and my sister stays with them) I was able to find a babysitter with the help of a co worker (actually they're related) and things have been going pretty well except for few days ago. The babysitter called me while I was at work to tell me that my 9 year old daughter broke her glasses, I got home, heard both sides of the story and came to a conclusion that it was in fact an accident. but the babysitter said my daughter broke them intentionally after she refused to let her outside late in the evening. I asked my 11 year old daughter and she said the babysitter's story is accurate but since she and her sister have a beef then, I figured she lied to set her sister up. my 9 year old daughter cried and said she didn't mean it and it was an accident. I apologized to the babysitter for the misunderstanding but she insisted there was no misunderstanding and then asked me to pay her for a pair of new glasses. I was taken aback by her request and told her I thought we talked this out and rolled it out as an accident but she insisted it wasn't an accident. I apologized but refused and said it was unfair to expect me to pay, especially since she didn't pay attention to keep her glasses safe regardless of wether it was an accident or not. The babysitter argued with me then started crying swearing that my daughter broke them to get back at her. My 11 year old daughter sided with her but my 9 year old said she is only siding with the babysitter for her own benefits. The girls started fighting and I ended up telling the babysitter to leave. she got my co worker involved and she said I should take responsibility and pay the babysitter for new glasses since she can not afford them being a broke college student and in need for glasses. I apologized but refused to pay, my co worker got upset and shamed me for condoning my younger daughter's actions and treating the babysitter poorly when she's the victim in this situation. It's been days and the babysitter is still wanting me to pay for new glasses but I feel like she's trying to use the fact that I'm in dire need of help and is hoping to get extra money out of my pocket.",

We've now set a date for this coming August and as we get closer more and more thoughts keep coming to me about how it should go. My biggest issue is that Kevin's best man is no longer his best man and is now his best woman. Kevin and Amy(MTF26) have been friends for a little over a decade and when they first met up until two years ago when our wedding was supposed to happen Amy identified as a man. Kevin and Amy have always had a very close almost sibling like relationship, Kevin had been kicked out by his mom at 17 and met Amy at work shortly after. She's been very close with him and he's told me multiple times that she is the closest thing he has to any family. Initially Amy had planned to not come out to Kevin until after the wedding but after finding out that the wedding was going to be delayed she came out to him. Without consulting me Kevin told her that he was fine with all of that and that if she was at a stage were she'd like to wear a dress when our wedding happened that he would find her a dress that matched the colors he had for his groomsmen. Amy has been medically transitioning for about a year or less now and Kevin told me that we need to find her a dress. I don't have a problem with Amy and I understand how close she is to Kevin but our wedding is largely for my very traditional family. Kevin has often said that this wedding isn't that important to him and that the only reason he's doing it is because it's important to me and my family. I know that my family would have a lot of issue with Amy which Im sure would bring a lot of unwanted or outright rude attention towards her. For this reason I've asked my fiance to choose someone else to be his best man and request that Amy attend as just a guest. This has lead to a large fight between the two of us with Kevin threatening to cancel the wedding if Amy can't be part of the wedding party because he wants someone from his family in it. Im trying to get him to understand the issues this will cause but I'm not sure he gets it. AITA?",

        "selftext": "I (27m) have been living with my girlfriend (29f) for several months now. For the most part things are really good and I plan to propose soon and hopefully have at least a couple of kids with her. However we've run up against a conflict. She's an absolute morning person. I hate mornings. By the time I force myself out of bed in the morning and into the shower she's already been up for at least 30 minutes--even though she has to be at work later than I do--and is at the stove making breakfast. She likes a huge breakfast in the morning. She usually has eggs, either French toast or pancakes, hashbrowns or breakfast potatoes, and sausage or bacon. Sometimes on weekends it's ham or steak. She eats almost nothing for lunch and usually has a smallish dinner but she loves a huge breakfast. Meanwhile I only ever have cold cereal for breakfast, or MAYBE if I'm feeling really ambitious some instant oatmeal and orange juice. I only even start to come alive halfway through my second cup of coffee and definitely don't feel like cooking in the morning. However my girlfriend obviously does. So recently I asked her if she'd start making breakfast for me, too. She asked if we were going to trade off and if I'd sometimes make breakfast for her, too. I told her no but reminded her that I do often make dinner for her. She said that since we trade off making dinner we should trade off making breakfast, too. I told her that there is no way I'll ever be able to muster that kind of energy first thing in the morning, but that since she obviously can that she should just make me breakfast too. I said that it would take next to no extra effort on her part to throw in a couple more eggs, strips of bacon, an extra portion of hashbrowns, etc since she's already doing it for herself, anyway. But it started a fight, with her saying that it wasn't fair for me to expect her to think of me in the morning since I don't do the same for her. She seems to think that her making breakfast for me should figure into our division of labor and that I should do something extra in return. But I think that since she makes a huge breakfast for herself every morning anyway that throwing an extra portion of whatever she's making on for me would take next-to no effort on her part, so why should I have to do more for her in return than I already do?",

        "selftext": "Throwaway My (M39) friend (M38)  recently got a service dog, its a diabetic alert dog.  The issue arises in that he wants to bring it to my house when I host hangouts/parties.  I'm not much of a dog person and really don't want it at my house.  It is a breed that sheds and I don't want to have to deal with dog hair in my house.  Also my kids regularly play in our yard and I don't want them to encounter dog poop and pee.  I've spend the last 10 years in this house turning it into a place my friends, family and I could hang out.  I have a pool, I built a bar in my basement, those types of upgrades.  I offered to meet out at a restaurant or someone else's place and host less, but my house is the preferred destination among everyone else.  I have amenities that others don't and there are no expensive food and bar tabs at my place.  I host a lot during football season and other major sporting events, with some general hangouts in between. I told my friend that his dog wasn't welcome.  I offered to pay for a monitoring device he can use while at my house, but he didn't take that offer well.  He let me know he wasn't happy and recently missed our Super Bowl get together.  AITA?",

        "selftext": "My 12-year old niece is really into arts and crafts, and recently got into crocheting. Before Christmas, she told me that she had a surprise gift for me, and seemed really excited about it. I told her I was really looking forward to it as well, and prepared her gift myself (which was actually art supplies).  On Christmas when we had our family gathering, she brought me her gift, and was super excited for me to open it. When I opened it, I saw a crocheted animal, but if I'm being honest, it looked REALLY REALLY bad. To give you an idea of what it looked like, imagine something from r/badtaxidermy but in crochet form. I couldn't help but burst out laughing, and I couldn't stop laughing no matter how hard I tried to suppress it, so I had to excuse myself to go to the washroom, where I locked myself for nearly 10 minutes.  When I came out, my niece was in tears with her parents trying to console her, and I apologized profusely and told her that I really liked her gift, but she kept crying and shouted at me, calling me a liar and that she sucked at art.  My niece avoided me for the vast majority of the party after that. I tried to make her feel better by displaying her gift on my living room cabinet, but my wife pulled me aside later in the day and told me to take it down after the party because it was in her words, really ugly and made her uncomfortable. Surprisingly, all the adults was very understanding of my situation, but I feel really bad because I feel like I destroyed my niece's confidence, and I'm not sure how I can make it up to her.",

        "selftext": "I (M26) am a second generation French immigrant to the US. I speak French and most of my family lives in France, so I try to make a trip back to France once or twice a year. I have been dating an American girl (F24) for two years now. My girlfriend does not speak French at all. The actual events in question happened this winter. I usually go to France around Christmas time. The most recent Christmas, my girlfriend wanted to come with me. I said sure as she had never been to France before and we'd been dating almost two years so it seemed reasonable.  My family comes from the South West, but I also have family in Paris so we stopped in Paris first. My gf wanted to eat at a fancy French restaurant while we were there, something with Michelin stars. Expensive, but not really a problem since I make pretty good money. We made a reservation for a good restaurant, not the best but still good. We had to make it months in advance because it's a restaurant that's high in demand. As a very upscale restaurant, there was also a dress code and things like that. We showed up and everything was fine at first. They took our coats, we sat down, the restaurant was beautiful, etc. The waiter then gave us our menu. I had to do all the communication as my gf doesn't speak French. I was showing my gf something on my menu and she noticed that mine had prices and hers didn't. I had completely forgotten about this tradition because it's just not common at all in the US. She asked me why mine had prices but not hers. I explained to her that it was just a tradition in many upscale French restaurants. She called it sexist and said it was ridiculous. I told her that it's just the way it is in these kinds of places, and that we shouldn't have come here if she was upset by this. She wanted me to ask for a menu with prices for her. I refused because we already had the prices and I didn't want to make a scene. She demanded that I confront a waiter about it or she would walk out. I called her bluff and she ended up staying, but didn't talk to me for the whole meal, which was delicious by the way. We've been back home for several months but she keeps bringing it up. I'm honestly considering ending the relationship over this because she will not stop talking about. She keeps accusing me of being sexist (I'm not) and has been making ridiculous comparisons. AITA?",

        "selftext": "Throwaway because reasons...My boyfriend (40M) and I (33F) have been together for five years and are trying to organize our next holiday. He's settled on a destination and so excited at the idea of a family trip. We're looking at flights that will likely be at least 9 hours long with business class flights, resort stay, and plenty of experiences. He makes significantly more than me but we will split the cost of the holiday 50/50 including my child's costs. The problem is he does not want to let my child (13) on to the same class on the plane as us.He thinks that my child should be grateful to be getting an international trip and just enjoy the movies and whatever other amenities there are on the flight. That they can pop up and visit us whenever in business class and that it's not worth the extra cost, even if he were a millionaire. I feel like it's weird to sit apart from my child for a 9+ hour flight, even if they're comfortable enough on a plane and I'd probably prefer to downgrade my flight if bf is unwilling to split that specific cost.He thinks I'm being weird for wanting to make that concession and it's not a big deal for child to fly alone. So, WIBTA or am I being a helicopter and stressing over something silly? Edit To Add: Just as a further explanation for why he's against it.   He has a view where children might not appreciate the value of business class and that his parents went on business class while he flew economy on his own. He absolutely wants to enjoy the business class for himself for the long haul on a nice plane. He's fine with me sitting in economy also or bumping up my child at my own cost, even though he disagrees morally and thinks I'm being kind of silly, he would accept it. He has spent plenty of money and time on my child, for birthdays, events and milestones. They get along well and have had very few upsets. Every now and then I've had to stick up for one or the other but I feel like that's to be expected with blended families.",

        "selftext": "We are in the process of moving into a new home. The house is more spacious then the old one but has limited rooms. It only has 3 rooms. My wife and I have 3 daughters 16yo/14yo/12yo and one son 10yo. The problem that's been tearing the family apart right now is that my 16yo daughter is refusing to share a room with her 2 sisters, She wants her 10yo brother's room. Her argument is that her brother is too young to have his own room and that she deserves more privacy and space since she's the eldest. Thing is we, as a family always give the boys their own rooms no matter the age while the girls share a room together. This method has proven to be workig cause girls naturally share while boys don't and they fight a lot.  My daughter threw a rage fit and got my wife involved. My wife called me unreasonable for thinking it's fair to make the 3 girls share one room while our son gets an entire room for himself, and he's the youngest!! So he's the one with the least privacy. I told her that it's been like this for years and just cause we're moving into a new home doesn't mean things have to change, to be honest part of me is thinking that my 16yo is doing this simply because she's against the idea of moving in the first place and is looking for excuses to not move in to the new home, my wife argued that moving our 12yo daughter with our 10yo is the best compromise, but my son won't accept this and I already know that. all I'm looking for is for everyone to be happy and comfortable and to my understanding, my daughter was fine with sharing a room with her sisters then, why Change her mind now?. My wife still sided with her and said that I should be careful because the girls are beginning to sense some sort of favoritism towards my son which isn't true at all. but it's all about what we're used to and what is the norm in the family, They're both not speaking to me and are acting somewhat hostile towards me. ETA for those who are saying I was in the wrong for buying a 3bedroom house, well our financial situation isn't the best right with everything happening in the world and real-estate prices getting higher and whatnot. Also, those who are saying I'm favoring my son, I'm not, I treat him the same as his sisters in pretty much everything and I 100% guarantee it, I accept my verdict nonetheless but still wanted to make few points clear. Thanks anyway.",

Due to limited space, no children were invited to the wedding except the bride's young nieces and nephews.  My baby was 10 months old at the time and I wasn't comfortable leaving him alone in an unfamiliar place with a stranger, which was a babysitter that my other cousins hired for their own kids. So I decided to bring him to the wedding. I wrote on the RSVP that I was bringing him but he would be sitting on my lap and I would bring my own food for him. My cousin didn't say anything so I assumed that he was OK with it. My baby cried at the ceremony but I quickly took him out of the room. At the reception I had him with me the whole time in a body carrier. He didn't make much of a fuss and I thought everything was OK.  After the wedding my aunt (groom's mom) confronted me and told me that I was rude for bringing my baby without permission. I explained that I wrote on the RSVP what I was planning to do but my cousin didn't object. She said that my cousin and his bride had a problem with it but the bride didn't want to start any drama because she doesn't know me well.  My other cousin's baby was 7 months old at the time and my aunt said that he had no problem leaving his baby with the certified babysitter and I should of done the same. And some of my cousins were upset because they thought that the groom gave me special treatment by letting me bring my baby and making them leave their kids with a babysitter. I didn't mean to start any drama. AITA?",

        "selftext": "So, I have a 20-year-old daughter who is currently living with me rent-free while she attends college. When she moved back home, we made a deal where she would cook and clean the house as a form of payment for her living here. She agreed to it, and we both thought it was fair. However, recently, she approached me and said that the cooking and cleaning are taking up too much of her time, making it hard for her to study and complete her homework. She asked if I could reduce the number of days she has to cook to give her more time for her studies. I told her that she should be grateful for the deal I offered her and that it's not that hard to do a few hours of chores compared to what many kids her age are going through. I pointed out that some of her peers are working 9-5 while going to school simultaneously, and I've given her the luxury of just handling some household chores in exchange for free housing. She ended up calling her aunt(my sister) behind my back to complain about how I'm treating her, and my sister called me, and kind of went off on me, basically saying I'm being too strict and should listen to my daughter. Here's where I'm unsure if I'm being an asshole. I want to stick to the agreement we made, but my sister's words have me questioning my stance. AITA for not wanting to change the deal we initially made? I thought it was a fair deal. Edit: Well I wasn't expecting this post to blow up. Just to address some things. For one I'm my Daughter's Father, not stepmother. Her mother is no longer with us and I'm currently single. So this isn't a Cinderella story. Two, I'm not sexist for making my daughter cook for my son's who are only children. They don't know how to cook, let alone clean themselves. Three, I'm not trying to take advantage of my daughter. As I said in my post, a lot of people her age would die to be in the position she's in right now. I'm paying for her college and all I expect back from her is a homemade meal. I appreciate the feedback, but a lot of bad assumptions were made about me so I had to clear it up. Edit 2: After reading a lot of you guy's comments, I'm leaning towards making an ultimatum with my daughter. Either she can get a job and pay some of the rent, so she no longer has to consistently cook & clean anymore or she can continue with the deal I initially offered her. To compromise a little bit, I might change some of the days she has to cook & clean, to days where she has more free time to do so. I believe if she decides to take a 9-5, she will eventually realize just how good the offer I initially made with her was. Some may think I'm being harsh, but my stance is different on that, because at her age I was going to school and I paid full rent by myself with no help from my family. So I believe this to be a fair compromise. ",

        "selftext": "So how to begin with this...I realize that on paper I am totally the asshole but when you dig deeper into my motivations I'm hoping its more of a grey area that anything else and maybe even I did the right thing.  When I was a teenager my dad bought me a classic 1972 Ford Bronco. It was my true passion and I don't recall a memory from high school that somehow doesn't involve that truck. Plus my dad and I would spend hours and hours working on it together and we went through that especially father/son rough patch when I was teenager it was always that Bronco that brought us back together. I made a huge mistake and sold the truck when I turned 19 and my dad died of a heart attack two months later so while not logical, I've always felt a karmic connection between the two events.  We had a baby in early February. she is our first and the light of my life. My wife is doing well but she's back at work and she's realized that she hates all the day cares we've tried and really wants to be a stay at home mom and plus she's still very hormonal from delivery, lack of sleep and breastfeeding so she's having a rough time and is angry a lot. I guess I need to say this.  Two weeks ago I was driving through our town's warehouse district and saw a Bronco that was pretty beat up but resembled mine. I stopped just for nostalgias sake and the owner came out and let me take a look inside. My dad and I had glued a wheat penny under the dash as sort of security measure so I just sort of checked and goddamned if it wasn't MY BRONCO!  I asked him if he'd ever consider selling it, he said actually someone was on I-25 as we spoke from Colorado to buy it for $21000. I freaked out and asked him if I could buy it right then and there for $23000. He said if I could come up with the cash, yes. I had been procrastinating setting up a 529 so I had $12000 in savings that my wife's parents had given us, I maxed out my credit card to Venmo and my mom bought down a check for $4000 and I fucking drove away in my old car. It was like a dream come true. Like a literal dream come true. It needs a lot of work I can't afford right now but it's mine. Like in my driveway mine. Again. I can't even describe what a joy this is.  My wife and her parents are furious with me. They feel I was deceptive, that a real man would have sacrificed anything and everything so my wife could go stay at home with his kids and that's setting aside that they gave us the money for a college fund. My point is my daughter is only 6 months old, we have 18 years to set up a college fund of her. But this Bronco means everything to me and if I wouldn't have acted it would have been gone forever. Now it can be that same connection between me and my kids. To me it's the literal meaning of happiness. Like I said on paper--asshole...whole story--grey area. How do you guys see it? Edit: had no idea this would go so one way. I guess I messed up. I talked with my mom and she is basically going to buy the bronco from me in order to refill the college fund and pay off the credit card. The $4k will be a gift and she\u2019s going to give me whatever I need to restore it. She\u2019s always been awesome to me and she\u2019s rather the money be spent now than wait for me and my sisters inheritance. Sorry to get everyone so mad at me, I was thinking with my emotions and acted badly edit2: are the \u201cmommy bailed you out\u201d comments really necessary ? I found a solution and it\u2019s coming from me and my sisters inheritance so it\u2019s not like I\u2019m not paying for it on my own eventually. Edit 3: my inbox is so buried I have no idea what those icons are that are where gold used to be. Does anyone know what those are ? Edit4: I\u2019m getting a 403 error whenever I try to respond, not sure what that means but I\u2019m still reading because honestly I\u2019m afraid to go home even with the great news I know my wife is going to be upset for one reason or another Edit5: does anyone know what 403 error means? I messaged the moderators but they must be busy /u/SnausageFest since you\u2019re a mod, do you know? I can\u2019t respond to any posts and get the \u201cstatus 403\u201d whenever I try. Thanks! Edit in the morning: I couldn\u2019t figure out why I was getting so many private\u2019s  but I guess this must be locked now. I didn\u2019t tell my wife that my mom bailed me out and lied and Said I found a buyer for the bronco. I\u2019ll figure out how to cross that bridge when I get there but my wife was so relieved that I \u201chad come to your senses\u201d I don\u2019t want to disappoint her. It\u2019s going to take all my lying skills to pull this one off over the next few years.",

        "selftext": "I(24F) have been dating Jay(28M) for four months. He is handsome, smart, funny, well-educated, has an awesome job, and is a sweetheart. Sunday he had a whole day planned for us. We were going to walk a nature trail and then go back to his place for dinner he was making. I was so excited because it was going to be the first time I'd be at his house. Since we were hiking he said I could bring my dog Shelby with us. He made us a roast and some vegetables for dinner. I finished my plate before Jay did and took it to the kitchen. There was still about half the roast left and it was close to Shelby's dinner time so I took half of the half of roast and some still raw vegetables from the fridge to put on a plate for Shelby. I was carrying the plate to the back door with Shelby to feed her outside and Jay asked me what I was doing. I told him feeding Shelby. Jay said something like Well that's not dog food. Jay knows I mainly feed Shelby a raw diet. I opened the door to put the plate down for Shelby and Jay got up, took the plate away from her, went to the kitchen and came back with it wrapped up in tinfoil and told me to leave. His excuse was that he made dinner for me and him, not me, him, and my dog and that I should've asked before I helped myself since he would've used his leftovers. I did leave but not before telling him that he made that meal for us so I could do with some of it as I pleased and he knew damn well how I feed Shelby. I tried talking to my friend about it later that night but she said Jay was right to be upset but this friend has never really approved of how I treat my own dog so I feel like she was probably a bit biased and the wrong person to ask. AITA for just feeding my dog like I normally would? Clarification: She does NOT get restaurant food daily, I eat out maybe 4 times a month. If what I eat is dog safe or the restaurant makes food for dogs on request, THEN I bring some home for her. Shelby's daily meals are a bit of brown rice, raw vegetables, and ground chicken hearts and beef livers. The hearts and livers are boiled just enough to kill bacteria and that is all with the approval of Shelby's vet. I asked Jay how he prepared the roast so I could know if it was safe to give her. That's also why I got her fresh, unused vegetables from the fridge. Update: I accept that Im the AH for what I said and did to Jay. Some of these responses were harsh but I see now how and why I was entitled. Thanks to people that responded to the actual issue. Others going on about her diet, thanks for the concern? but I came here to ask about Jay. Not get into a debate about dog foods. Shelby's been on her diet for 6 years and is a healthy and active puppo, that's all I and my vet need to know. As for Jay, I apologized to him and he did accept my apology but he broke it off. He said it was the last straw for him over me doing things without asking first. He has talked to me about taking things off his plate or his drink without asking before. I've tried to do better but keep slipping up. I didn't realize I was that bad about it so I'm going to work on myself for the next guy. For people that said not going to his place for 4 months was a red flag, that was my decision that he respected. I don't want to go to someone's house or them know where I live the first few months of dating and getting to know each other.",

I\u2019ve told Mia numerous times that she can just pop in whenever she wants to (she works from home) but she rarely does.  She did at the beginning but it\u2019s been happening less and less. Instead, she keeps suggesting we go out for coffee or pizza or even a drink but I don\u2019t have the time and always just tell her to come over and we\u2019ll have coffee at my place. She asked if I wanted to go out with her and her other friends for a drink last weekend but I said that no but she\u2019s welcome to come over and we\u2019ll have a few drinks at mine. She said she already had plans and it felt weird to drink when she knows there\u2019s a child around.  Honestly, I feel neglected. I feel like she put me on a back burner and doesn\u2019t want to be friends anymore. I\u2019m always available but she rarely comes over and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s fair. Today, I saw her photos from Saturday night out and I was fuming. She ditched me just so she could go and drink like she\u2019s 20 again. I felt rejected and horrible, I thought we were best friends but she clearly doesn\u2019t value me when she won\u2019t even have a few drinks with me at my house. When she finished work, she called and asked if I fancied going for coffee to town but I asked her to come over again. She said yes but before she disconnected, I heard her mumble \u201clike always.\u201d This really annoyed me. When she came over, I decided to be open about everything. And while not my proudest or most mature moment, I shouted at her that she\u2019s an awful friend m, that she barely comes over and if she doesn\u2019t want to spend time with me to just say it and stop playing around. She said she\u2019s always been accommodating but it\u2019s been 2 years and she doesn\u2019t want to spend time with me when there\u2019s always a kid, especially now when she has to watch her language (Mia likes to swear). I said that she knew I had a child and responsibilities. And she said that Tom (my partner) could take care of Ciara once in a while so I could have a time off. This felt really intrusive and I told her to mind her own business and not meddle on my marriage.  I was really angry with her and kicked her out. She called me a selfish asshole on her way out. Normally, I would expect her to call by now with apologies but she hasn\u2019t done so and I\u2019m starting to wonder was I the asshole or was she? Perhaps I was too harsh and should\u2019ve been more careful with discussing it.",

        "selftext": "Last weekend was my (26\u039c) birthday. Me and my GF of 2 years Kenzie (26F) had plans to get dinner. She came to pick me up from work and her car was packed and my best friend/his wife were in the backseat. To my surprise she planned a whole weekend away to my favorite lake, rented a sick house on the water and invited all our friends. Her sister/husband, my friends/their SO\u2019s and a few of Kenzie\u2019s friends all arrived Thursday night. It was an awesome and I was stoked for the weekend. We met thru my best childhood friend Grace (26F). Grace and kenzie were college friends and I never thought I had a chance. Kenzie is beautiful and while I\u2019m not ugly, I\u2019ve always felt like we weren\u2019t in the same league. No idea how I got her and I still don\u2019t.  Thursday night went well. Friday we swam and hung out at the house most of the day. We started drinking and playing games at night. Kenzie\u2019s sister broke out this couples game. Basically you pick one person in the relationship that fits the description or it has prompts to engage in debates between couples. Kenzie was pretty drunk by now because she\u2019s a lightweight and was drinking most of the night.  It was fun till a question of \u201cWhat originally attracted you to your SO\u201d. Kenzie blurted out \u201che was safe. And I knew he wouldn\u2019t cheat or leave me.\u201d I looked at her with a face and was like \u201chuh\u201d. She then says \u201cyeah you seemed nice enough and after my abusive ex I wanted a safer option\u201d. Things got really awakened and her sister quickly read a different card. I was really embarrassed and flustered so I said I had to pee and walked outside. I called Grace to tell her what happened (she was working and couldn\u2019t come) and she got upset. I told her I wanted to leave. She said I didn\u2019t need to take that and she would be there in the morning to get me. The night died down and kenzie tried talking to me in front of everyone but I told her we\u2019d talk about it another time. I decided to pack my bags and sleep on the couch. And before anyone woke up I left. I texted Kenzie and told her that I didn\u2019t want to fight about what happened and ruin everyones trip. So I was going home for the weekend and we could talk whenever she got home.  She blew my phone up all Saturday as did a few of my friends. I decided to go golfing and just turn my phone off. I just didn\u2019t want to talk to anyone. When Kenzie showed up at my place Sunday she was fuming. Saying that me leaving early ruined the whole trip. It was all anyone could talk about. And the whole vibe felt off because the birthday boy was gone. That she felt like a POS and I didn\u2019t give her a chance to explain. And she hardly even remembers what she said to begin with. She rented a boat (I love boating) and felt like I disrespected her efforts/money to put together the trip. I told her that I didn\u2019t feel like arguing so I went home to avoid the drama. Some said that it was an AH move to just bail and I should have stayed because she did put a done of effort into the trip. AITA? 8am edit: I\u2019ve had some time to cool off and we are finally gonna sit down and talk out in person what happened. I\u2019m gonna get clarity hopefully and see if this is a salvageable relationship. For everyone saying it was just the \u201csafe\u201d comment. I implore you to read the entirety of what she said. Being called \u201csafe\u201d and a \u201csafer option\u201d are two totally different things. Also the \u201cseemed nice enough\u201d comment bothered the hell out of me. She tried to speak to me immediately afterwards in front of everyone while still drunk which is why I didn\u2019t want to talk. Will provide updates when possible.",

        "selftext": "I have a close friend from college who's getting married, and she's been asking for my help to contribute to her wedding. I think it's sweet that she's thinking of me, but I don't think it's a good idea for me to help out financially.  My friend and I have been close for a few years now, and I'm happy for her. She is struggling financially, and they have asked that instead of wedding gifts, people can donate to parts of their wedding ceremony (theres a registry and everything, like \u201ctable flowers\u201d and stuff). I'm know she's trying to save as much money as possible for certain reasons unrelated to the wedding. But I just don't think it's right for me to be helping her out with the costs at this time. I'm a recent doctorate candidate (soon), am currently writing a memoir, and I dont know when I will have time to get a job - anything I give is just that much less time I can live on my own. Even if I could afford it, I don't think it's fair that I should have to help out when I know her fiance already has a job and could definitely get another, and some of his friends seem well off. I tried to explain my financial situation to my friend, but she's still asking for help, even a little. She suggested that I could contribute a much smaller amount than others, but I still don't think it's a good idea. I told her that if I was in a better financial situation I would be more than happy to help out, but right now it just isn't possible.  My friend got really mad at me and said that I was selfish, and that she expected more from me.  Our group of friends all pledged to help pay for each others weddings back in college, and she says that since she helped pay for my wedding ($550), that I should help her out, even if it's just $20. She is also threatening to tell our group of friends, just because all of them contributed to my wedding - but she completely ignores the fact that my marriage didn\u2019t last even one year. I don't want to lose her friendship, and I really don\u2019t want her to tell our friends - my financial situation is private. More importantly, I also don't want to be taken advantage of. AITA for not wanting to help pay for her wedding? ***Edit: ok, after seeing all the reactions and misunderstandings here, I talked with a couple other friends in our group and showed them the post. They sent me some money ($100) to give to our friend for her wedding. I\u2019m going to offer $5 at first and see if that is enough. Couple other points:  - My friends fianc\u00e9 agreed to purchase my ticket to fly, so giving up that money and not going is not an option - My friend did also give me a wedding gift which I returned - I do not have the money for a wedding gift, but I believe being there for her on her big day is a present itself - everyone laughs when I say \u201cmy presence is present enough\u201d so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s as negative as others see it. - I have not been accepted into a school yet, I am starting to apply for PHD programs. I\u2019m writing a memoir as a tribute and gift back for my experiences - and doing it now to prepare to become a doctor. ***Edit 2: to clarify, I understood the $100 is to be used for ALL friend weddings in our group, not just the one now. I am NOT just pocketing the money. I am saving it for when others get married and that means I have to try to ration it out, for lack of a better word. Note - there are only three people left in the group who are unmarried: my friend, one other person, and myself. ***EDIT 3: A LOT of people are asking about my memoir. I won\u2019t be sharing details here so as to not take it off topic. Anyone can DM me for more info though ***Edit 4: I offered the $5, and didn\u2019t hear back for a couple days. So today I offered $20 as a gesture of good will, without waiting to hear about the $5. She said no, and even had the audacity to tell me I didn\u2019t need to come to her wedding at all! I offered $25, then $50. Still nothing she just seemed to get more upset even when I INCREASED the amount. Idk what she expects literally more than double what she asked for, and it isn\u2019t enough?",

        "selftext": "Context: Me f26 and my husband m32 welcomed our daughter several months ago. So far we've agreed on every decision made regarding our daughter but the topic of peircing her ears came up and he said he didn't like the idea despite me explaining that 1. It's normal thing for babies and 2. It looks pretty 3. no it's not cultural we're both white but it's a great new experience imo. He said he needed time to think about it but weeks went by and he hasn't said okay yet. Mom suggested we do it behind his back and he'll then come around and see for himself that it's a good thing since he was having doubts and being indecisive. I was hasitant but I agreed and chose a day where he was out all day. Thankfully it went smoothly but when my husband got home and found out he lost his temper and went on about what a major breach of trust I just committed and how I should have never decided to do this without him fully agreeing since he's the parent too and got extra mad that I went behind his back and was being sneaky and untruthful about it. I tried to explain that first it was my mom's idea and I didn't think he'd overreact like that but he insisted that I did was not okay and that I overruled him as a parent and damaged the trust we have and also put our daughter through pain and discomfort. I had an argument with him and told him he was acting like this is just his daughter, I'm the mother and my opinion does have heavier weight than his to some degree. He got offended by that and went to stay with his mom who called and berated me for going behind her son's back and treating him as a less than when it comes to our daughter but I never understood why he thought that. He is not talking to me now. I think he's being selfish by saying he needed time to think about it and trying to stall without considering my point of view. Mom is on my side here but he and my inlaws said I screwed up for making such decision without his okay and going behind his back to get it done. AITA? Edit/ putting this out there/ My husband was aware that I had plans to get our daughter's ears peirced and we've had many many discussions about it so it wasn't like it was out of the blue and I didn't bring it up with him. I did but he kept giving me the same I need time to think about it the entire time. How long was I supposed to wait? Why he kept stalling instrad of just saying just no? He just kept stalling and putting off any further discussions/compromises that we could've had as a way maybe to get me to just abandon the whole idea.",

        "selftext": "edit: I want to clarify two things.  1. I am her dad, not sure why everyone keeps referring to me as her mother 2. Everyone keeps telling me the grade due date is actually the post date. If I was allowed to I would post the link so that you could see that the calendar literally says December 19th: Grades Due From Faculty and December 20th Grades Posted. She literally admitted to lying that they were due Sunday (today) so I'm not sure why people are so stuck on insistng I'm wrong about that   I'm 54 and daughter is 28. She is home on break from grad school getting her phd. She's only home for two weeks because she says she doesn't have any more time even though she has a month break. That's been a big thing with her lately, she is constantly to busy to do things with us or help us out even though she does have the time. I got my younger daughter a sweater and it turns out she already has it. I called my older daughter from work on Friday and told her she needed to run and exchange it for a different one. She said ok, she'd do it the next day. I said it needed to be done that day to get the best options and she said she was grading so she can't. I told her that it's not like she can't pause her grading, run out, and exchange it. She said she wasn't going to slow down her work and just said that I should do it when I got back from work that day. I said I was busy to and didn't feel like running out after a long day of work and she said neither did she. But she doesn't have a long day of work, she's sitting on her ass on her computer all day and doesn't even have scheduled hours to work, she can do it whenever she wants. Today things really kicked off because I needed her to pick up an online order for a gift for my mom, her grandma. She again used the excuse of grading (she hadn't even started working yet, it was in the morning and she was drinking coffee and having breakfast.) She said that she needs to have her grades done by today but I looked it up on the website and she has until Monday evening so I called her on her BS, and she said she had other work due on Monday so she needed to get the grading done today (but wouldn't enlighten me on what this mysterious other work is). I said well tough, this needs to be picked up today so I can wrap it and I was going into the office so I couldn't do it. She said that if I don't want to do it myself, then it will be done on her own time. I told her with that attitude she can stay somewhere else and she said happily and packed her things claiming she didn't want to stay here anyway but was only doing so because I insisted. She left her gifts and said to not expect her for the holidays and she'll go to her girlfriend's family instead. I think it's ridiculous that she is throwing a fit just because she can't constantly live like she's the only person on the planet but my wife and other daughter is now furious with me. So I figured I'd ask here because my younger daughter is always reading the stories with me. AITA or am I correct that my daughter is self centered and childish?",

        "selftext": "We came home from the hospital 5 weeks ago with our first child, a boy. For the next 4 weeks, my wife did not let any of my family visit our son. Her mother and sister came over several times a week. My wife refuses to let my family see him because she doesn't want to play host. My family understands that being a new mom is stressful and they have no expectations of being treated like proper guests. I told her it's not fair that her family can come & go as they please but my family can't even meet him. She said her family comes over to help her, which is not really true, they just hold the baby a little and if the baby isn't sleeping then I am the one taking care of him while they are here. They don't clean or anything, at most they might bring some takeout on the way over. Finally I decided I will be taking the baby to see my parents last weekend. My wife doesn't breastfeed so I got all the formula and diapers and everything I would need for a couple days and packed a bag. I thought this was a win-win because my wife could have some time to herself or come along and she would be under no pressure to host anyone. But she got mad when I told her what I would do but I told her this was happening, I am the baby's father and my family has a right to see him just as hers does. She refused to come along and said she can't believe I'm treating a new mother this way. I left on Friday evening and didn't hear anything from my wife on Saturday, but her sister & mom were over & sent a bunch of texts basically accusing me of abusing a new mother. Finally on Sunday she started sending me text after text on how I was a terrible husband, how I kidnapped her son, how a baby can't be separated from its mother, etc. It got so bad that I cut my visit short and drove home. She was very mad when I got home and refusing to speak to me. The next day when the baby was asleep I sat her down and tried to calmly explain to her that I am the FATHER of the baby so I have as much right to where he goes and who he sees as she does, we are equal parents and she needs to accept reasonable compromises when we disagree, like my family being able to see our son and she not having to host them. She called me an asshole and shouted that she gets more say because she's the one who was pregnant with him. At that point I said if she thinks that way & the accusations she texted me, I think she really needs to see a doctor and get assessed for PPD because her behavior is not normal. She called me an AH and said I was abusing my position as the earner (money was never part of any discussion). She has been giving me a near-silent treatment all week, resisting any attempts to discuss therapy, and her sister has texted me saying I should apologize to her for what I said. I told her sister that I had said absolutely nothing wrong in response to being accused of kidnapping and being a lesser parent to MY son. I am standing my ground but I need an outside perspective, AITA? EDIT: To clarify, the idea my wife might have PPD did not occur to me until after the visit with my family. EDIT 2: My wife knew of my plan to visit my family several days in advance. I planned a weekend trip because they are several hours away. EDIT 3: I want to emphasize this because people keep asking about it. **I DID NOT WANT TO SEPARATE MY SON FROM HIS MOTHER. I WANTED HER TO COME WITH US. SHE REFUSED.** I did not forcibly take my son away from her. It was her decision not to come along and her decision not to allow my family to come to her. EDIT 4: My wife is not physically handicapped from childbirth. She has been mobile and going out including a 6 hour car ride 2 weeks ago. EDIT 5: My wife refused any options involving my family coming to us. No hotel or in-town visits.",

His mom came to wait with me there but didn't speak to me because we have been having some minor disagreements. She offered me coffee but I declined politely.  Hours after the surgery, we were told only one person goes into the room for the day since he was still under anesthesia. From what I understand he woke up calling for his mom, the nurse asked for his mom to go in and she did. I was irritated and felt like all this waiting and stressing out got ignored. The nurse told me that he was still not fully awake and was repeatedly calling for his mom spontaneously, she was basically hinting that I shouldn't get worked up over a natural reaction from my husband but I couldn't help feel irked. I wanted to go home so I left 10 minutes later. His mom called saying she got out the room after I left so I could get time with him but instead I couldn't wait and went home. She said this was not okay and I flew off the handle for no reason, I said that her son acted like I wasn't there but she said that he can not be blamed for something he can't control and I'm just being unfair to him and putting blame on him because of a disagreement between her and I. I cut the conversation short after I sensed that she somehow blamed me for being unacknowledged and ignored. Her husband texted later saying I'm being hostile over nothing and that I should focus on my husband's health instead of acting petty but I don't think I did anything that qualifies as petty.",

        "selftext": " Me (F.) and My ex husband (M.) are divorced. We have a 16 yo son together Mason. I got remarried to my husband (M.) Nathan. My ex husband and I used to argue on who should get Mason for the holidays back when he was little. As he got older we started letting him decide. Last year he spend Christmas with me, Nathan and my inlaws and he complained that the experience was terrible because he said Nathan and his family had little to no accomodation for his food choices (I'm not defending them but my inlaws are quite traditional when it comes to food and a bit ignorant to what types of foods Mason eats). He also said he didn't feel as welcom as the other kids in the family and that Nathan forced him to share his personal stuff like his phone so that his stepnephews could watch christmas movies. Yesterday, during breakfast we were talking about christmas and what we were planning this year but hem out of nowhere announced that he'll be spending this Christmas with his dad at a rental christmas cottage in his favorite town. I was stunned, so was Nathan. I asked Mason when and how he agreed to this arrangement but he pointed back to what happened last christmas and said he didn't want to basically have another shitty holiday and be miserable I told him that his dad should've come to me first but he argued that he's already okayed it and so he saw no need for my opinion. We started arguing and he started complaining about me trying to ruin the experience but in response I told him that he has already ruined christmas for me and his stepdad the minhte he agreed to this arrangement. He got up and walked away after saying that I was being overdramatic. Nathan just sat there and looked down. I had a huge argument on the phone with Mason's dad and he kept giving me an attitude and laughjng and saying that I sounded pathetic. When I told him I'd have my lawyer call him, he bbackpaddeled and said he woukdn't have done this if Mason didn't like it. He urged me to drop it and let Mason have this experience or he'll resent me for missing it. Now Mason isn't speaking to me. Nathan is trying to convince him to stay with us because without him, our christmas is ruined but he won't budge from the looks of it. AITA for not dropping it as well? What I meant by why didn't his dad come to me first is that he planned to take Mason out of town which is a big deal to me. There's going to be traveling.",

I was recently informed by a young man I work with that my daughter strips at a club about 40 minutes away. I confronted her on this and she said she  didn\u2019t plan to do it after she graduated, and she needed some money. I told her then work at McDonalds, not use her body. We got into an argument, and i asked her to quit stripping and get a decent job then. She refused and said stripping was easy money, so basically I said there was no need for me to pay her car payment anymore since she is making money so easily. She got upset and said that wasn\u2019t fair, and that she doesn\u2019t make enough for that. I told her to figure it out. She told my wife about what happened, and my wife is upset by her job of choice but says it\u2019s unfair for me to stop supporting her so suddenly over an argument. I think it\u2019s perfectly fair, it\u2019s my money and my decision when to cut it off.",

I like Stephanie she has been great with my kids and makes my ex happy. My ex invited me to their wedding and I was happy for him. It was my day with the kids so it made sense for me to come was his reasoning. When I arrived at the wedding Stephanie thanked me for dropping the kids off and brushed me off. We had never had any issues before. I explained that I was going to stay for the reception and she was very upset. I was confused because I assumed she knew I would be in attendance. It turned out she didn\u2019t consider that I would actually accept the invitation. I told her that I was invited and since I took the 2 hour drive I would be staying for the entire duration. She didn\u2019t like this response. Stephanie asked me to leave and I stood my ground. She went on to complain about my dress upstaging hers. My ex and former mother in law helped her to calm down and the wedding shortly began. I thought that was the end of it, but later in private Stephanie accused me of trying to ruin her special day. She is convinced that I wanted to show off and make the wedding about my divorce. She said it was rude for me not to leave after the bride requested it because it was her special day. I told her that I am not responsible for her insecurities and once again reminded her that I have no interest in \u201dstealing\u201d my ex back.

We (my husband 28m) made a list in October and sent it out to everyone  Some rules include -up to date on ALL vaccines -if you feel anyway sick don\u2019t visit - let us know a week before hand so we can arrange a day/time- no smokers - no phone calls or visits between 7:30pm-10pm -you can only stay an hour -no picking up the baby without consent -no Adivce -no perfume/deodorant - no is no we won\u2019t explain why - no pictures to be taken or posted on social media - if you visit the first time you will be expected to give mom (me) a gift card and a gift for baby from out approved list- before you ever come no matter how many times you will be give a list of a ether food or groceries to bring with you AND a chore for a list of your choosing - no more than two visits a week per person  It\u2019s help to keep the visits to minimum and no one can complain about favouritism because everyone is treated equally. Which brings me onto my current situation my sister in law(20f)  studies in a different part of the country and is rarely home asked to visit last week before she had to go back to school, so We set up a date with link to our gift list than sent her the takeout we\u2019d like including the chores she can choose from  Sent immediately texted back saying she\u2019s broke and can she do extra chores instead,Me and my husband talked about it and came to the decision that if we bent the rules for one person everyone would want the same treatment  We told her no that we were very clear about our rules and maybe next time she could visit. She begged even said would clean the whole house because it would be June before she\u2019s would be home again and we simply texted no. She didn\u2019t reply  She left this morning and we got multiple texts for my in laws belittling us for using our child as a cash grab, my husband simply replied it was our rules and no one deserves special treatment than told his family they were on a time out and blocked them Since than my family and our friends have told us we were wrong because she is a broke collage student and they would have understood if we looked the other way once.

        "selftext": "I'll preface this by saying that my husband (Luke) M32 does not get along with my parents. You can't tell who's right or who's wrong, there's always this ongoing tension between them but can be civil enough to sit together at one table. I recently got an invitation for christmas celebration from my parents. The invitation including me and Luke but Luke thought this was somewhat rude and a disrespectful because he believes he should get his own invitation and not have his name mentioned as an extention to mine. We talked and he said he wouldn't go unless they send him a proper invitation. I called mom and asked if she could do it. She thought it was ridiculous and said that she and dad did the same with my sister and her husband. I told her it was fine but Luke can be sensitive like that and so a simple invitation in a form of a text directly to him will fix it. She got defensive and said that Luke is being ridiculous. Dad claimed that Luke is trying to pull some power move to humiliate them but I thought this was a small issue. They still thought it was ridiculous so I told them I won't attend if they don't send him a separate invitation because he won't attend if he doesn't get it. This blew up and my sister started arguing saying Luke needs to get over himself and shamed me for trying to force our parents to send him an invitation by saying I won't come if they don't. We haven't talked after that and we're waiting as of now. edit! The invitation I recieved was in a text. Luke is saying that a simple text to him will finish the conflict but my parents still think it's ridiculous and that they won't invite him since they already have. **UPDATE! I just got off the phone with my sister. She told me our parents have just disinvited me (Luke was probably already disinvited since the argument occured) from the celebration. I feel horrible but I can't argue anymore, just like I can't argue about what everybody else in the comments is saying. I admit it! Luke is the problem. He just caused me to be disinvited from the event and is blaming ME for it.**",

        "selftext": "Throwaway account  I (36 male) have a 16 year old daughter named Jane. Jane is a great kid and was really close to my mom until she passed away a year ago. My mother gave one piece of her jewelry to her children before she passed away. I was given her engagement ring.  I have been planning a proposal to my girlfriend, Laura (30 female) for about 6 months now. Jane is from my previous relationship (her mother and I were never married). I\u2019ve been dating Laura for about 5 years.  I told Jane I was going to propose. She was happy about it and asked to see the ring. I told her I\u2019d be using my mothers ring and Jane looked upset so I asked her what was wrong. She said she had assumed the ring would be hers since she is my daughter. I explained the ring was given to me and there are other heirlooms (small items like rosary beads) she can have.  For clarification I do have the money to buy a ring but the sentimental value of this ring is why I wanted to use it. Laura also helped us take care of our mom while she was sick and they were close.  I proposed to Laura with the ring and she said yes. After this happened Jane cried to her uncle (my brother) about it and he understands both points. His wife thinks I\u2019m an AH so do some other family members. I obviously can\u2019t take it back from Laura when I already proposed.  AITA? Edit:  The ring was given to me not Jane.  Laura has known my mother her whole life our mothers are best friends and have been hinting we should get married as long as I can remember. Update:  My daughter and brother decided to call my father to come to my house and talk to me. Laura was out to dinner with her friends.  My daughter and brother explained to my father their thoughts on the situation. I stayed quiet while they explained their point so that my father could really hear what my daughter was saying and so I could also hear her out. My father is a marine veteran and very blunt.  My father stopped them and said he\u2019s heard enough. He said my mother would have wanted Laura to have the ring and Jane isn\u2019t showing fhe maturity to receive an heirloom right now. He told her he\u2019s disappointed in her entitlement and that she needed to get her attitude in check by his next visit. He also reminded everyone Laura\u2019s been family for years even before we were together even if it\u2019s not by blood.  My daughter said yes sir and isn\u2019t happy about the outcome but accepts my father saying this is what my mother wanted. Final update:  Since everyone wants to know Laura\u2019s take here we go. I told Laura what was going on and that Jane is upset. I also told her the ring is hers now and she can decide who it is eventually passed down to. I know a lot of people won\u2019t agree with this but it\u2019s what I\u2019m doing.  We have a pre nup in the works for other properties we own. Laura suggested adding the ring just for secure minds and we agreed we would add that it would be given back to the family if we were to divorce.  Laura will not be passing on the ring unless she passes away. That is my fathers request to her and she is honoring that.  We have spoken to Jane and I have explained all of this. I\u2019ve explained she\u2019ll always be my daughter and that won\u2019t change. She understands. She apologized to Laura and me for her behavior and explained she was just upset. Laura had a one on one talk with her as well about how she loves her and isn\u2019t trying to replace anyone or change the family dynamic we have. Jane seems to feel better. Update:  Laura might be pregnant. Jane does know. Update:  The ring has been added to our will. We have decided to continue the tradition I started of the ring going to a son to give to his wife. If we do not have a son then the ring will go to a grandson or to my nephew. Since the ring will not be given to anyone until we pass we are not telling Jane that has been added to the will.",

        "selftext": "Longtime lurker here. Hoping some of you guys can weigh in on what has become a really frustrating situation with a close friend and his partner. So my wife (29F) and I (29M) have been hosting dinner parties a few times a year for as long as we\u2019ve lived in our current city. We like to go all out and cook elaborate multi-course meals, so we limit our invitations to just a few close friends, since cooking such a complex dinner is an all-day affair and the food costs add up quickly. We have about four to six people we invite to these events, depending on their availability, and it\u2019s become a great tradition in our social circle.  Our friend James started dating his girlfriend Sarah about a year and a half ago, and when we first extended her an invitation, we were informed that Sarah was vegan. I thanked James for letting us know and said she was more than welcome to bring her own food so she would have something to eat. He agreed, and the two of them have been attending our parties regularly for the past year. Everything was fine, until now. During our most recent dinner this past week, we noticed that Sarah was very quiet and looked like she was about to cry. My wife asked her what was wrong, but she told us not to worry about it and kept dodging the question, so we didn\u2019t push the issue.  However, after the meal, James took us aside privately and told us that Sarah felt hurt because we never provided any dishes she could eat at our dinners and it seemed like we were deliberately excluding her. He added that he thought we were being rude and inconsiderate by not accommodating her, which really pissed me off, and we got into a huge argument over it.  My wife feels terrible that Sarah was so upset and apologized to her and James profusely, but I don\u2019t agree that we did anything wrong. I like Sarah very much as a person and I don\u2019t have anything against her dietary choices, but I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s fair to expect us to change our entire menu or make an entire separate meal for one person, especially when so much time and effort goes into creating these dinners. For the record, nobody else has any dietary restrictions. AITA?",

        "selftext": " hey guys! So, a bit of context I (M32) have been with my wife (F30) for 3 years. she comes from a country where women get to keep their maiden name after marriage which was fine with me though as someone who comes from the south my family pushed for my wife to take my last name but she ended up keeping hers which made my family somewhat unhappy saying it was disrespectful of her to keep her maiden name but thankfully they got over it and things got better and we reconciled later. now this last name issue has been brought up again when my wife and I found out we were expecting a baby boy.I sat with my wife down and told her that my son is going to get my last name and explained so that there's no confusion but she disagreed and said no and came up with a compromise which was that our son gets both our last names but I declined explaining how awkward and confusing and just complicated that would be. not too mention the middle name so that would be a long name but she said I should consider since my last name will still be there but I said no and told her we'll just have to go with what most families here do and is going by the father's last name. she threw a fit calling me selfish and accused me of treating her as if she as a mother gets less or no say but I reminded her that she got to keep her maiden name and so we're even. she then argued that I was mixing two things that are unrelated and was holding the fact she got to keep her maiden over her head though it was her right to do that same with deciding what surname our son will have. I said I was sorry but I can not accept this compromise especially with how my family will react and told her she should just go with the flow and agree on my son having my last name. she got upset and refused to talk to me after that calling me selfish and a dictator and a minion for my family even though I'm just looking out for our son's best intetest and keeping them in mind. I just think she's being deliberately stubborn here. but I'm not sure. Aita? EDIT Jesus, whoah guys..there is just way too many responses here man and I won't be able to respond to all of them BUT I've got a couple of things to say and I'm adding them here for everyone to see. ONE - Just to be perfectly clear here I did NOT have an issue with my wife keeping her last name. in fact I encouraged her to stick to it after my family started giving us grief about it. And TWO - The main reason I was initially against using both names is the fact that our son might end up having a very long name as a full name.that's it. I have nothing against my wife's last name. I respect it I respect her family (they seem sane and levelheaded) and I appreciate them a lot. but as two blended families with two different backgrounds we kinda...we tend to disagree sometimes.",

        "selftext": "I (32m, white) am potentially in trouble at work, but I don't really think I deserve it. My coworker, Anna (23-ish f, asian), is new at our office and she brings her own lunch on days we don't have a food truck. On Thursday (yesterday), she brought in a homemade stir fry and used our shared microwave in the break room to do it. I was in the room when she took it out of the microwave, and it smelled heavenly. I asked her about the recipe and she told me it was just a bunch of ingredients and spices thrown together as to not waste any veggies that might go bad soon.  When I was telling her how good it smelled, I also mentioned that some other people at the office might think it would be too smelly or ethnic (as in, racist people tend to look down on ethnic things). I have read those kind of stories on here about microagressions when it comes to people of color and the food they bring in, and I wanted to warn her that she might not want to bring it in anymore so it doesn't happen to her. I emphasized that it smelled good to me personally, though. I guess a couple of the other co-workers in the room overheard our conversation, because after Anna left the room, some of them sort of quietly told me how it was inappropriate for me to have said that. I told them that it's true, that ethnic food gets ridiculed for smelling too strong and that I disagreed with that senitment, but I also think she would face less harassment if she didn't bring in that food anymore. One of my other coworkers then said that I was the only one harassing her and making insinuations that her food is problematic, plus the fact that she hasn't even been bringing in her own food that often since she just started last week, so there couldn't have been an opportunity to have had this hypothetical harassment happen to her. I just wanted people, yes, even the assholes, at the office to make her feel welcomed. I left work that day not thinking anything of it, until the following morning where I hear from a different coworker that Anna talked to our HR department about the conversation and how she was hurt. I'm a bit frustrated as to why she didn't talk to me about it first since it was just a misunderstanding and that I'm looking out for her. I did notice that today she was trying to dodge me, which is unusual and a bit heartbreaking. I just want to work things out. I wanted to be a friend to her and help her out since this is one of her first jobs out of undergrad, but this has been blown of out proportion. Now my coworkers think I'm racist, but I really try my best to be an ally, but then again what do I know? So, am I the asshole for telling her that her food might be a bit too much for other potentitally racist people in the office to handle? EDIT: Some people have said to edit this post to add this: yes, I get it, I'm the asshole. What I said was really stupid. If it means anything to you guys, I remember entering the workforce as a young man shadowing assholes and I didn't know how to express how shitty I was treated since I thought it was normal to be treated a certain way or overhear certain things. I just thought she was a sweet girl who didn't deserve to see the nasty side of corporate life so quick, but I guess I ended up being like the guys that made my earlier career so god awful.  Anyway I want to apologize to her in the most HR-friendly way this Tuesday. Hopefully she doesn't quit, but I also don't want to be the one that gets fired. Fingers crossed. Thank you for opening my eyes and I hope to do my due diligence to be a real ally.",

        "selftext": "Me (26m) and my wife (24f) have been married for 4 years. During those 4 years she had the same job which requires her to be away Friday to Sunday, so she leaves early on Friday and returns about 4-5pm on Sunday. Occasionally it would be leaving on Saturday and returning Sunday. She also has to work some of the school/public holidays. I work full time and get just a bit above minimum wage and tips, so our bills are split 60 (her) to 40(me). While I find myself struggling with money and having to have to borrow from the joint bank account, my wife never have this problem. I know she is getting paid more then I do as she works for a high profile client, but I'm not sure by how much more. She also wouldn't tell me what exactly she is doing, all I know is that it is connected to her degree and it is 100% not a sex work or nothing in that industry. The reason why she won't tell me is because she signed the contract and it is highly confidential so she is not allowed to go into details. She does chores around the house but doesn't cook (she admits herself she is a bad cook and hates it), instead she would order either those premade healthy meals you then heat up for herself or takeaway. When I'm home and she hasn't ordered she will order for me too. So most of the day while I'm working she is either in our house chilling (watching TV, playing video games, reading or exercising) or shopping or in the gym. Over the years I got annoyed with this and have asked her to find another job so she has something to do while I'm working instead of wasting her day. She told me she is not wasting her day but relaxing and her job pays her enough so she can afford the lifestyle she wants. I said it is not fair on me, as I come home tired while she has done nothing all day, to which she said I can find another job or a different job but I am an asshole for wanting her to find another job because I feel tired when coming back from my work, when she has already got a job she loves. After she won't talk to me. I have spoken to my family and while my parents agree with me that she needs to work, my sisters took my wife's side and called me a massive asshole. Edit: I'm not saying she needs to quit the job she has. I'm saying she needs to find another job to do during her freetime, could be a part time one, since she doesn't really do much during the day.",

Couple days ago me and my brother we\u2019re hanging out late night doing regular guy things drinking, watching sports, etc. We haven\u2019t seen each other in maybe 5-6 years so naturally we started talking about life and what\u2019s been going on the past few years. Towards the end of our conversation we started to get to the \u201csecrets\u201d I mentioned something along the lines that I smoked weed for the first time and did various other substances (This was hard for me to tell because my whole life I was pretty much anti-drugs and such.) We both laughed about it saying \u201cJust don\u2019t let mom find out\u201d The joke died out after a little bit and then he just blurted out \u201cI cheated on my wife...\u201d At first it didn\u2019t register until I saw his face and he was dead serious. I for one hate cheaters, but I try to do my best not to judge anyone for their actions. He begins explaining this was something that happened about 4 years ago when his wife was always busy with work. She would travel a lot and be away for weeks at a time. He told me they were going through a tough time back then lots of arguing, not communicating, and that he felt really lonely. During this same time my brother met a girl at his local gym, started off as friends, slowly kept bonding and you guessed they did the sex. He told me this occasion only happened once and pretty much cut her off after that night because he started to feel guilty for a short while. Few months later his relationship turned for the better for him and his wife. Pretty much after his wife\u2019s travels slowed down his whole relationship has been great. They\u2019ve both gotten promotions, bought a house, more family vacations. (They have a kid) He told me life has been good to him now and he\u2019s just thankful things have finally worked out.  As stated before I hate cheaters and I\u2019ve always felt that the person being cheated on always has the right know. I know for sure this would probably destroy their marriage and there would be a fight for the kid. My heart tells me I have to tell her because it\u2019s the right thing to do, especially because I\u2019ve known my brother to cheat one other time on an ex-girlfriend couple years before his current wife. My brain tells me it\u2019s none of my business and I should keep my mouth shut. I don\u2019t want to see their kid go throughout that kind pain either. On one hand I betray my brother if I say something on the other hand I betray our close family friend because I know this secret and I don\u2019t say anything. I wish he never told me, ignorance is truly bliss. So there it is, WIBTA if I said something? TLDR: Brother Cheated on his wife years ago because he was depressed, now everything is better and he told me about it, but now I feel obligated to tell his wife because she\u2019s a close friend. WIBTA? Edit: I\u2019m referring SIL as close family friend because my family and her family have known each since elementary school days and thus are Very close lol. I thought this iteration would make the relationship sound stronger than just SIL, but it looks like I was wrong. Second Edit: Wow this is on the front page, I never intended nor expected this blow up as it did! I\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t reply to everyone, but there will be some kind of update.",

But can be civil enough to sit at the same table. So, we went and had dinner and talked and everything was going well, no argument nothing til after my wife went to use the bathroom. Later my brother went to use the bathroom then came back looking pissed. He kept giving me and my wife looks but I didn't know what was going on til he pulled me aside before we left and told me that my wife had left her used pad in his bathroom. I was shocked and didn't know what to say because this felt highly inappropriate. He said he didn't appreciate what my wife did and that it was a sign of disrespect towards him. I apologized profoundly and said I didn't know about it. He asked me to speak to her or she wouldn't be welcome in his place anymore. We got in the car and I asked my wife about it, she nonchantly said there was nothing wrong with what she did and that my brother was being ridiculous. I kind of flipped and told her it was very inappropriate for her to leave her used pad in his place even if it was in the bathroom and in the trashcan because it made him uncomfortable. She yelled asking what she was supoosed to do and I told her she could've took it with her and threw it outside not in his bathroom -- that's my brother's place and he told me how he felt about it. She yelled at me calling my brother an incel and me an asshole for getting in her face about it. She said she needed to use the bathroom and it's not like the pad was vidible since she dumped it in the trashcan. At home we still argued about it and she kept on calling me and my brother names. She's currently not speaking to me and is avoiding me entirely. Regardless, I feel like it's his place and he gets to express what makes him uncomfortable in it. EDIT. I can't give info or expand on what was seen but I can tell you that the trash can does not have a lid. It's not like one of those trashcans that have a lid on top and you can push it. What I want to emphasize on is the fact that as guests we should respect people's homes and not argue about what makes them uncomfortable. He said it made him uncomfortable and that should, in my opinion, be acknowledged.",

Sophies mom called me yesterday, said that they were at an indoor playground, and Sophie wanted to know if Ellie could come and play. Sophies mom offered to put me on her punch card (she prepays for 10-20 visits at a time because it\u2019s cheaper) so it would be free for me so I got Ellie in the car and we met them at the playground.  After about an hour of playing, the girls started to get hungry. I packed a snack for Ellie but Sophie\u2019s mom didn\u2019t have any snacks on her. I told her they sell snacks in the front but she claimed that she didn\u2019t have any money on her and asked me to buy Sophie some goldfish. I said sure, Venmo me and I\u2019ll grab some.  I said no, I took care of my kid and it\u2019s not my job to take care of hers too. She says she paid for my kid to get in so I could cover the $2 for the goldfish. I told her if she wanted me to bring snacks she should\u2019ve told me when she invited me but I won\u2019t be wasting $2 for a $.50 bag of goldfish because she was unprepared. She went up to the front and I don\u2019t know if she lied about not having money but she came back with goldfish and fruit snacks. Now she\u2019s being petty by asking me to pay her back for all of the times we\u2019ve used their memberships and guest passes so we\u2019re not getting along.

For a multitude of reasons we haven't done a trip since 2018.  I am married and we have an 18 month old.  My sister has a boyfriend, and my brother has some sort of terrier and no GF I know of. My brother has morphed into a self described dog dad and based off social media seems to rarely do things without the dog.  We live in the same city, but different areas and we don't see him all that much.  The few times i've been around his dog it behaves fine.  Its too friendly for me and I can't speak to how it behaves over multiple days or around babies. My parents have a Vrbo beach house in Florida booked.  In a few week the deadline for a full refund for canceling is coming up and my parents need to know if we are in.  We live in the west side of the USA so we'd be flying.  I found out my brother plans to bring his dog.  My parents aren't thrilled about it but it is what it is, those are my parents words. I'm not a dog person, I despise them on airplanes.  I do not want to travel with the dog (tentatively we are on the same flight), I do not want to stay the week in the same house as the dog, I do not want activities based on being dog friendly, and I do not want the dog around my son. Our parents want to stay out of it and have us hash it out.  I broached the topic with my brother.  Essentially he isn't flexible on the dog, it is his family and it is a family vacation.  He says my 18 month old will be far more annoying and loud than his dog.  He seems firm on this and i'm ready to pull out of the trip.  If I don't go, the trip may fall apart.  WIBTA?",

        "selftext": "I have a big family that\u2019s incredibly close. We have big family dinners every few months where we all meet at my great grand fathers estate and eat together. Typically how this works is that the women go cook for the time they\u2019re there and the men don\u2019t. Which I am fully aware it\u2019s sexist as hell. That being said I am one of the youngest people in family and my protests mean literally nothing.  Some of those women choose not to cook, however this is usually met with a level of ostracizing. The women who don\u2019t cook are lives and long term girlfriends. So they kinda already have a good family relationship doctored in. When I have seen new partners not cook, it\u2019s gone bad. Like completely ostracized, not speaking, cattiness, rudeness etc. This dinner will be in two weeks and my girlfriend was asked if she would attend. Initially she said yes, which is great. I want for her to meet everyone and for everyone to get used to her being around, but when I explained to her the tradition she was understandably bothered.  I told her that I understood where she was coming from, however it was best for everyone if she just played along. I told her this isn\u2019t a permanent thing and that I am only asking her to do this so that she can avoid bad treatment from the rest of the family. This is her first impression and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s best if we cause waves. She told me that it\u2019s unacceptable and that if she has to do that she will not be going. I\u2019ve tried to find a compromise with her on this but she won\u2019t budge and she\u2019s pissed at me. She told me that if I think it\u2019s acceptable to make her do this I\u2019m just as bad as everyone else, while my point is that she needs to make a good first impression. AITA?",

The only downside is that he\u2019s almost addicted to buying things that are on sale or have coupons despite being a VP at his company. I\u2019m not talking about sometimes or even most of the time, I would be alright with that. He never buys anything at full price. NEVER! He plans his cooking around what\u2019s on sale that week at the grocery stores. All of his clothes were bought on sale or clearance, even his socks and boxers. Last week we were at my friend\u2019s house for dinner and she commented on his shirt. He proudly said he got it on clearance last year for $20. I was mortified. Lastly, we don\u2019t go to any restaurant unless he finds a coupon or they\u2019re running some kind of special. Things came to ahead last night when we went out to dinner. He had a digital coupon for buy one get one free. For some reason, the restaurant\u2019s computer didn\u2019t recognize the deal and the poor cashier couldn\u2019t make it work. We were holding up the crowded line because he refused to pay for both dinners. Finally the cashier called the manager but he was busy somewhere else in the restaurant. While we waited, the people behind us were getting annoyed. I was so embarrassed I left him standing in line by himself and went to the car. We argued the entire drive home. We were supposed to go to the movies, because he got free tickets, but I wasn\u2019t in the mood so he dropped me off. We haven\u2019t texted today at all.

I don't know how he ended up with my sister, she's the total opposite, loud, funny, outgoing. She's beautiful tho, really beautiful, and when they got together everyone said how good they looked. Anna seemed to be really in love with him ALL THE TIME, she used to say how dreamy he was, how good he treated her and how spoiled she felt, but Lance was always so stern and quiet, she would revolve around him at family gatherings but he wouldn't engage that much with everyone but me and her. I was surprised when he asked her to marry him.My sister never took the wifey role too serious, she had a non-traditional wedding and Lance when along with it, she made a bunch of rules that he agreed to and then they moved to his house. Anna banned house utensils from the wedding gift list, she doesn't work, didn't finish her studies and they don't plan on having kids. My sister is pretty much only into her looks (And I didn't think Lance cared for that before), she's always on Snapchat or Instagram, I thought that after getting married she would dress more appropriate since she used to use crop tops, blouses, dresses and shirts that showed her cleavage, short skirts or tight jean, but she says that Lance likes her just fine. Last week was my dad's birthday and we had a party, my sister and Lance came and she was wearing a pretty short floral dress, nonetheless most of the men were looking at her including my dad's friends, Lance was as stoic as always and my sister came to my mom and I and saying that she didn't know why he was so quiet since he's not like that (HE is like that wtf) so I told her that if she didn't dressed like that he might take her more seriously. She got sad and sat quietly the rest of the night and I didn't think much of that, but a few days ago Lance texted me and said that he would appreciate if I didn't comment on her wife's way of dressing again. ???

I like to keep notes on women I talk to about their favorite things, activities they enjoy, gifts/candy they like, sappy shit like that. I suck at remembering things like that so I decided to keep a spreadsheet. Eventually after getting a handful of entries. I offhandedly mentioned it to my friend group. One had the idea that I share it with them so we could all keep new entries as they \u201ccaught\u201d different entries.  So this expanded further. Right now about 40 guys have access to it and it\u2019s mainly the guys in my frat, and the women featured are girls from different sororities. We also added more information such as like where you should take them if you really wanna impress them. We don\u2019t keep this information for any nefarious or scumbaggy reasons.  Just to help us know what to do if we want to impress certain girls. Like the original idea of this was just to keep information like favorite color so I didn\u2019t every forget their favorite colors. Now it\u2019s helping a lot of guys. Somehow, a girl who was on the list found out and she was pissed tf off. She was eventually able to trace it back to me so I assume someone who was simping for her snitched when the Pok\u00e9dex wasn\u2019t making the girl like him. So she\u2019s pissed off and she made it out to be a guide to hooking up with women, when it\u2019s most definitely not that. It\u2019s just to make impressing them on dates easier. That\u2019s it. She\u2019s made a big deal of this telling so many girls around campus and now they\u2019re all saying that by the start of the fall semester, none of them will be visiting our fraternity or going to our parties. Now all the guys are mad at me, when I\u2019m not even the one who told girls about the list and they were all also using the list. I also think it\u2019s unfair to say the list was all about sex when it wasn\u2019t at all. AITA? Edit- I\u2019m not a stalker. There was no information in it that could\u2019ve been used to hurt someone. Only to have a better date. And it isn\u2019t about sex. I never used it for just sex.",

My neighbor across the hall, a woman around my age or a little younger (I actually don't know her first name but I'll call her Katie) lives across the hall from me diagonally and has for about 2 years. We exchange hellos but aren't friendly, which is how it is with most of my neighbors. So I don't know how to cook, and due to losing one of my part time gigs, I don't have as much money for takeout anymore. I'm getting really sick of eating cheap fast food or box mac and cheese. I'm gaining weight and I never feel great. This is where Katie comes in. I can always smell her cooking in the hall and it always smells amazing (I know it isn't the other person at our end of our hall cause it's a single old man). I've even complimented it a few times. So I got the idea that I'd offer to give her some money each week to cook a little extra and bring it over to me (or I can pick it up from her!) at night. She's cooking anyway and then I'd have varied presumably delicious food. I asked her the next time I saw her and she looked surprised and said she couldn't because she was too busy (which didn't make sense cause she cooks almost every day but okay). The next time I saw her a few days later, I asked her if she was sure and upped the amount I was offering, and she said she was sure and that it was rude to ask me, and that she isn't a housekeeper for hire and I should get a housekeeper if that's what I want. She also called me 'a stranger' even though we have talked in the halls before. Overall she made me feel like a big jerk and really embarrassed for even asking her, and a little mad because she was acting like I was being creepy (I wasn't, trust me, she isn't my type). I think asking her to split cooking wasn't completely outlandish, since she cooks every day anyway and it wouldn't be hard to make a little more. So, AITA? EDIT: People keep assuming I'm sexist because I didn't think it was the old man who lives on our hall cooking. It's not an assumption for me. He and I have lived across from each other for 6 years. The cooking smells didn't start til she moved in, and I've talked to her about how good her cooking smells before. EDIT: Okay. It is abundantly clear that I was the asshole and asking her was inappropriate and, as much as I hate to admit it, creepy. My instinct is to apologize to her but since my instinct was to ask her in the first place, I'll do the opposite and stay out of her hair. Thanks.",

We were all sitting at dinner table and I remembered when my brother's girlfriend, who's a widow, saying that she keeps an urn of her late husband's ashes in the house. Conversation let from one thing to another then, I looked at my brother and asked him quietly if he was comfortable with having his girlfriend's late husband's urn in the house. he gave me a long stare so I figured the answer was yes but maybe, he couldn't tell his girlfriend about it fearing she'd misunderstand maybe?. So I brought it up with her and told her it was quite weird to have her late husband's urn in the house. She looked at me and was apparently caught off guard by what I said. she said that she didn't think so and that it wasn't like the urn was on display, also said this is her late husband's house and where the urn should be. I told her it felt weird especially, since she just had my brother move in with her and he must be feeling uncomfortable with the idea, his girlfriend looked upset and got quiet. my brother shouted none of your goddamned business, shut your mouth Elijah, jeezus! I responded with I mean..personally I wouldn't be cool with my girl keeping an urn of her ex within close approximate, at best best it'd make me feel uncomfortable, at worst it'd make me feel creeped out. his girlfriend then replyed by saying that I have no business dating a widow then and I shrugged. She excused herself to the kitchen and stayed there, my brother went off on me calling me an obnoxios asshole for making dinner awkward and upsetting his girlfriend. I told him I was just giving my opinion but he lashed out more. my parents and I left and they told me my brother's girlfriend was being hypersensitive, but I too went too far and upset my brother and probably sparked an argument between them and I should reach to apologize but I'm not sure. [edit] Guys! please, One thing you should know is that I had no intentions of being hurtful. I do not hate my brother's girlfriend, infact, we get along pretty well but I just wanted to add that I had no malicious intent here. I'm not the the type of guys who go out of their way to act maliciously but I feel kind of guilty for how the situation played out. [edit2] my parents are the ones who said she was being hypersensitive, not me. [edit3] Yes, I overheard my brother venting about the urn when he first moved in just so you know.",

        "selftext": "Our son is 22 and our daughter is 26. She bought a house in July. We know that moving into a new home always comes with unexpected costs, right after you've probably depleted most of your funds. So, for Christmas we gave her $4000. Our son we gave a few different gifts totaling somewhere around $800. Our daughter had to work Christmas, but we did Christmas on the 26th and she stayed with us for the holidays from then until yesterday. Our son still lives with us, and today he told us both that he didn't want to say anything while his sister was here, but his feelings were hurt by the disparity in the value of the gifts. We explained that the gifts we got him were tailored to his interests, but his sister has just passed a big life milestone where money is more important to her right now than sentiment. He said it's still hurtful because it feels like we are more proud of her than him. My wife got really frustrated when he said that and asked why he would choose the least charitable interpretation of our actions. He said that's just how he felt and he couldn't control it. I said that we didn't give her money because we were more proud, but because we had experience being new homeowners and knowing that something always breaks in that first six months and it's always expensive. He said that was all fine and good, but it still hurt to get a worse present and feel like an afterthought. My wife asked if he expected us to get him four thousand dollars worth of gifts. He said no, but he expected the gifts between him and his sister to be equal. My wife said that's the same thing, and my son said it isn't. He said we could have given her the monetary equivalent of what we gave him. I told him that it isn't really fair for him to decide how much we spend on someone else's gift. Furthermore, cash is less personal than gifts, so giving her a cash equivalent to what he got would be her getting the worse gift. He said we weren't listening to him, just justifying. My wife said we didn't need to justify anything, and he was being entitled. At that point he said he didn't want to talk unless everyone was civil and he went to his room. He skipped lunch (breakfast for him) today, and when he left for work he didn't say goodbye even though I was right by the door. My wife is irritated, and my son is clearly resenting us. I can't really decide if we're in the wrong here. On the one hand, we should be able to give our money to whoever we want. On the other, I never want to hurt my son's feelings. Were we wrong?",

        "selftext": "I got a dog 2 years ago (Corgi) and she is very much so my side kick. I've been with my fiance for 5 years. My fiance does like the dog but she is currently pregnant and experiencing massive migraines and has been snapping at everything.  So every morning when I get up I find my fiance already awake and at the table relaxing. As soon as I get out of the bed, my dog goes nuts. It's like super energy where she is running sideways, barking up a storm, jumping from the bed to the floor a million times (causing the apartment to shake because it's old asf), etc and I will sit there and sing made up songs to her and just fuck around with her. It is pretty noisy and I can be loud. It's just my way of interacting with my pet. I also have ADHD, so I'm fully aware that I can be ridiculously loud and sometimes I simply forget to tone it down. My fiance has complained about it a few times and I will absolutely try to tone it down for awhile but as fucked up as it sounds, the second she stops complaining and it's out of sight, out of mind, I start doing it again. If I catch myself I apologize immediately but sometimes I don't even catch myself doing it.  So she has been getting up earlier than normal because she says she needs peace and quiet away from you and the dog because she can't hear herself think when we get up and then she starts getting migraines and being overall pissed off. But now she is complaining because I can sense her not in the bed anymore probably after twenty minutes of her being gone and her warmth no longer there and then I'm wide awake and the dog senses it and ya know. So she's now getting pissed because she thinks I'm purposely not letting her have space and purposely annoying her with my behaviors. I'm not, truly but it seems like it I guess. I've tried just laying in bed for awhile so she can relax but I get stir crazy and I also don't feel like I should have to stay in bed so she can be alone when I live here too.  But she flipped this morning. I felt her sneaking out of bed this morning at 5am and tiptoe out of the room. I watched her sit at the table with her book. Well, the dog saw me awake and immediately goes ballistic. Jumping on the bed, whining, barking, etc. She comes in and says will you guys calm down so I can have time to myself for once? I just side eyed her because I'm getting pissed at this point with her demands. She says well? I tell her to get over herself. Just because she's pregnant doesn't mean I have to change who I am or change how the household works or change my dynamic with my dog. She immediately left after telling me to go fuck myself and won't answer my calls. She's been gone for 6 hours.",

        "selftext": "A friend at work pointed me to this to get some more advice/points of view on my situation. I (46F) am the mother to two wonderful children, Andrew (16M) and Nicole (21F). Nicole was very bright as a child and excelled in her classes, and she headed into college with a plan to get a Master\u2019s at least. I never had to worry about her doing well or hitting milestones, but the last few years have been very surprising. She became a bit withdrawn in her teen years, more so than I realized until now, and after her first year of college she suddenly moved out from a relative\u2019s home and got her own apartment. Then, after her second year of college (last May) she told me and her father (58M) that she was dropping out and might return in a year, but wasn\u2019t sure, and that she was incredibly stressed and depressed and had been for years. It felt like it was coming out of nowhere.  Last fall she got a full time job and started talking about how she was happy and finally in a good routine and that she loved working. I was glad things were at least going well for her now, but still hoping she\u2019d return to college soon. One of the biggest recent bombshells she dropped on me though was a month ago when I drove to visit her. We went out for lunch, and we started talking about this friend (25F) of hers. Eventually, my daughter admitted to me that she was a lesbian, and that she and this girl had been dating since January and that she FLEW TO MEET HER WITHOUT TELLING ME OR HER FATHER! Mind you, she flew over 1,000 miles to see this girl that she had NEVER MET and had only called and video chatted with for a few months. I was shocked and angry, but all I did was gently scold her for not telling me, but that I\u2019m glad she\u2019s okay and that she had a good time with her girlfriend. I\u2019m very new to this whole thing with my daughter, as I thought she was interested in men, but I\u2019m willing to support her because I love her.  The problem now is that she told me earlier this week that she intends to move within the next year and a half. She says it may be sooner rather than later because things are changing with her girlfriend\u2019s living situation and she wanted to give me a heads up. I told her absolutely not, that she can\u2019t move in with someone she\u2019s only been dating for a couple of months, especially not when she\u2019s moving several states away. All of her family is HERE, including me and her father and her brother, and her three living grandparents. I told her she\u2019s too young and she can\u2019t move that far away from us just for a girl. She told me that regardless of her girlfriend, she\u2019s been wanting to move far away for years and that her girlfriend\u2019s state was on a list of potential places. She said she loved being there when she visited and can\u2019t wait to go back. She says I\u2019m being unreasonable by asking her to stay and that she hates it here and feels like she \u201ccan\u2019t be herself\u201d. Am I being the a-hole here? I don\u2019t think she\u2019s old enough or mature enough to leave. Edit because someone asked- my daughter didn\u2019t ask for money. She almost never asks for money, she\u2019s like her father in that way. She\u2019s almost completely financially independent. I have her on my health/dental insurance to help her out, my mother pays her monthly phone plan because she insisted on doing something for my daughter, and my daughters grandfather on her father\u2019s side pays her car insurance, and my daughter goes to her father when she has car troubles because he has a lot of experience with cars. My daughter takes care of all her other needs on her own. Edit- my child\u2019s father is NOT my husband. We never married. We have not been together since she was born. I would have left him earlier had I not become pregnant. I regret being involved with him because he is why I was introduced and became addicted to drugs. I do not regret my daughter. Please stop calling me a homophobe. I support my daughter. I am just apparently ignorant to some things about being gay. Edit- I am no longer talking about or answering questions about my addiction. Most of you are making baseless assumptions and disgusting accusations and I won\u2019t entertain them. I tried my best to be a good mother and get clean. That\u2019s that. I may not have been the best person to have custody of her as a child, but neither was her actively abusive father who stalked, abused, manipulated, and intimidated me the entire time I\u2019ve known him. Edit 3/24- I can\u2019t keep up with the comments. I\u2019ve also been banned from commenting because I apparently broke a rule. I\u2019m going to try to talk to my daughter about all of this when I see her this weekend. I want to be a part of her life even if I think she\u2019s moving in the wrong direction.",

        "selftext": "Wife and I own a home in an HOA. We split the mortgage and HOA fee 50/50. Recently a vacancy opened up on the Board of Directors and I applied for it and was chosen to serve. As compensation, the HOA fee ($400) is waived for our unit. My wife wants to split this windfall 50/50. I feel since I\u2019m on the Board and do all the work, the $400 should be all mine. She thinks if I keep the $400 it\u2019s tantamount to her *paying me* $200 since our overall housing costs have dropped $400 but she doesn\u2019t benefit financially. This has caused some of our worst fighting and I am leaning towards just giving in and splitting the money even thoughI do all the work. Am I the asshole? UPDATE: I\u2019ve seen the err of my ways and will split the rebate with my wife. Before I get into it, I just want to say there are some very sick people on this subreddit who think they know things about me and my wife with absolutely no basis in fact. But hey, it\u2019s the Internet. Expect trash. As for the many people who commented like a normal person and especially the Redditors who DM\u2019ed me and agreed with or validated my position, thank you. Ultimately, u/flyryan convinced me with saying \u201c[t]he perk you are getting is no longer having to pay the HOA fees. Not a salary of $400/mo. They are saying your household no longer has to pay THEM for their service and you are turning around and collecting $200 from your wife. You\u2019re essentially getting a free service (HOA membership) as a perk for your volunteer work and then reselling half of that service to your wife for $200. She is no longer paying HOA fees, but rather YOU to be HOA president.\u201d  Anyway\u2014while I still believe my position has some logic behind it, I now see my wife\u2019s perspective which helps soften my stance considerably.

Anyway she recently invited me to come over and have dinner with her parents at their home.  She still lives with them for now. We are getting more serious and they wanted to meet me. If it's relevant her parents are Indian immigrants to the US and I am white. So, I thought it was a completely casual meeting and I wore an Iron Maiden T-shirt.

I went and met her parents and thought we'd had a good meeting. However my girlfriend is NOT happy with me. She feels as if me dressing in a T-Shirt rather than a nicer button-up shirt was bad enough, but that wearing a shirt with skulls on it was--in her words--just obnoxious. I honestly just dressed for the meeting the way I usually do and didn't even think about it. I think that if she had certain standards that she should have communicated them to me beforehand. But she thinks that what I did was obviously stupid and inappropriate and that I should have known better. Is she right or is she being too critical?",

        "selftext": "I ride the bus because I can't afford a car, insurance, gas, etc. I'm 19F and live in the US. For context.  A couple days ago I was on a bus that wasn't that busy. Not empty, but there were multiple unused seats and no one had to stand. I had just gone shopping and had heavy bags that were hard to carry and hardly fit in front of my legs.  So I sat in one seat and placed my bags on the seat next to me, essentially taking up 2 seats on my own. Since it wasn't crowded when I got on I didn't see an issue and like I said the bags were super heavy and hurt to carry so I wanted to set them down.  The bus ride was kind of long and as it went on more and more people got on the bus. It eventually got pretty crowded to the point where some people had to stand up.  I didn't ever move my bag or offer the seat to someone. In my experience most people don't want to sit next to strangers anyway and a lot of the time people will end up standing instead of sitting in an empty seat next to someone they don't know. Also no one said anything to me.  At the last stop (ended at the bus station where pretty much everyone was getting off) someone passive aggressively told me you could have moved your bag and not been inconsiderate and rude. Everyone wants to sit not just you. Or something along those lines. I didn't really respond because I didn't know what to say.  The person who said that never asked me to move my stuff, and if they did I probably would have. So I don't understand how I was being rude? They could have asked during the ride instead of insulting me after it was already done. Busses are also generally first come first serve so I think my behavior was normal.  AITA?",

When I married my husband I kept my maiden name which he was perfectly okay with. We already discussed this and agreed that any future kids we have will automatically take his last name. His family considers this huge deal and I decided to keep to just go with it. But recently I started thinking about it a lot more and figured that it would be unfair for my unborn son to take my husband's family name and not mine. I talked to my family and they said my husband and inlaws are ridiculous to push this on me without a compromise expecting I go with it. So I went home and told my husband that I've changed my mind about the last name thing and want to either have both our last names combined or my last name to be given to our son. He was confused saying we had an agreement and then asked what was the cause of this sudden change of mind. I told him and he said I can't just do that and called me selfish when I pointed out that I'm the mother I get a say too. We went back n forth on this and he said no way he and his family will let me do this to his son, as if my last name is a disgrace. We had a fight and we stopped talking after this. He said that I broke and violated my part of the deal and I should just 'deal' with it now but I won't accept it. AITA?",

        "selftext": "My wife (35F) and I (35M) have been together for 10 years, married 5. We grew up completely different. She's the only child of a surgeon father. Her mother died when she was 2 and it was her and her father for most of her life. He remarried when she was 17. He's wealthy, sent her to private school, paid for her college, and when we met a decade ago he was still paying her rent, even though she had a solid job. I come from a poor family. But we both have pretty good jobs and make around the same amount of money now. She is such a daddy's girl and it's been affecting our relationship. Anytime she wants or needs something, she goes to her dad first. And sometimes it's about things I could help with. I work in tech and back when we started dating she was starting grad school and she asked her dad what laptop should I get  I told her I actually work in the field (which she already knew) and could easily answer that and get her what she needs and she just kind of shrugged. Okay fine. These little things have happened throughout the last decade. But, there have been bigger issues recently.Last year, she decided she needs a new car. I disagreed. Her car is fine and she works from home and barely drives. She was adamant, though. About a month later, she tells me she's getting a new car. I told her we need to make these decisions together and we share finances and this is a major purchase. She says, oh, my dad is buying it. He said we can just sell mine and get some extra money. I told her it's kind of ridiculous to ask her dad to buy her a brand new car when she has a perfectly good one and we don't need it anyways. She got upset and said it's not that big of a deal and her dad doesn't mind and that the car wasn't that expensive anyways. She said I'm overreacting and that it's okay for her dad to do nice things for her. She got a brand new 2022 car completely paid for by her dad. And we sold her old one. Now, we are buying a new house. We've finally narrowed it down to two options. We were discussing it last week and my wife says oh I don't think house A is good my dad said he think we could do a lot better in our budget. Before she talked to her dad, she LOVED House A. So, I got a bit frustrated and said it didn't matter what her dad thought because this is our family's home and he won't be living there. She got angry. We started arguing. We both said mean things. I called her a spoiled brat and said she needed to grow up and she got upset and slept in the guest room and has it's been a few days and we have barely spoken. She said I was so mean to her.  UPDATE: wow did not expect this to get so much traction. This was mostly a late night stream of consciousness and I realize I left a lot out, of course. I DID apologize to my wife for the name calling and we both agreed we have some issues to work through. Here's some more info for context and to answer some questions I've seen asked:  1. We could have afforded the car on our own. We do well for ourselves. I was not worried about not being able to afford it. I just did not understand the rationale of buying a brand new car when you have a perfectly good one. Her old car wasn't even that old. It was a 2019 and had pretty much all of the same features her new one has. It didn't make sense to me. Also, we have a toddler and it's actually harder for her to get him in the new car than the old one. She also barely drives. I mean, seriously, the car sits in the garage 90% of the time. She has even said before that she hates driving. Sure it was free but I guess it's more about the principle than the car itself. But, she got what she wanted so whatever.  2. We've been together 10 years - has it always been this  way? Why did I stay? --- valid points. And something I could dig deeper on. No answer right now other than I just fell in love and didn't want to leave.  3. Do I have my own daddy issues? No, not really. My dad and I are fine. My parents are still married. We were very poor growing up and my parents were undocumented, and that was a very stressful way to live but my family made it work. I live on the other side of the country now so I don't see them as much but we talk and visit regularly.  4. My father in law is a nice enough guy and for what it's worth, he also says his daughter is spoiled and has made comments throughout the years about it. Obviously I didn't need to call her a spoiled brat and I recognize the difference in her dad saying it and me but I am not the first person to say it to her. I KNOW THAT DOESN'T MAKE IT RIGHT.  5. I recognize I have my own issues due to poverty, trauma and all of that. I have been to individual therapy. That is a forever ongoing process.  6. The house: All of the reasons my wife gave me are just matters of personal preference, like my dad says we need a bigger kitchen, my dad says we need a bigger backyard. He is also convinced we will have more children even though we said we so not want anymore so he also said we need more rooms for more kids. Nothing about safety of the house, the price, etc..just things he personally doesn't like or would have different in his home. Also we've been looking for over a year and he has given his thoughts many many times throughout the year. So, I'm not saying she shouldn't ask him for advice. Also, no, he would not be paying for any of the house.  7. My wife has never been to any type of counseling in her life. When I suggested grief counseling for her after I started my own she looked at me like I said something ridiculous. Her family is very skeptical about therapy. So, I'm not sure if I will get her to do marriage counseling but we will talk about this further.  8. Finally, my wife is a funny, creative, and beautiful woman. She's a great mom. She makes everyone laugh. I do love her despite what the post may make some of you believe. Thanks to those who sent me thoughtful messages. They provided interesting perspectives. ALSO THIS NOT A FULL PICTURE OF EVERYTHING. I'M JUST NOT WILLING TO SPEND ANYMORE TIME WRITING IT. IT'S A LOT.",

        "selftext": "Throwaway because people who know me are on here.  Before the birth of our daughter, my wife and I both worked full time in low-middle earning jobs with my wife earning a bit more than I but not by much.  My wife returned to work out of necessity when our daughter was 3 months old. Her mental health became pretty bad and she has a minor disability that makes work life a little hard and she found it a bit worse after having our daughter but we had to do what we had to do.  My wife's nan who sort of raised her and was her only family passed away sadly when our daughter was 6 months old. My wife inherited everything she owned. It was a big inheritance. Not enough for us both to immediately retire but a lot. Enough for us to buy a decent house outright, a new car each and to put some away for a comfortable retirement.\u00a0  Shortly after her nan died, my wife stopped working and became a stay at home mom. Partially due to grief and struggles at her job, and a bit because she always would have preferred to stay home with our daughter.\u00a0 Thing is though, I'd rather not work and be a stay at home dad too but I've been sucking it up because we still need an income to get by.  My wife spoke with me recently about how to budget so we can live off just my income (she'd been dipping into savings to pull her weight but that's all tied up in investments now). I said if I'm the one who has to work (and I'd rather not) I don't think I should have to spend my money funding her hobbies and spending money. If she chooses not to work then she can buy clothes at the charity shop instead of new and get a friend to cut her hair for free etc. Or she can get a job working a night shift or start an online business or something to fund her spending money. I don't see why I should have to pay for stuff like her sewing materials and gym membership since I don't benefit from them and they're not my responsibility. I'm happy to pay for stuff for our daughter seeing as she's my responsibility so I don't think I'm being unreasonable here. I work 36 hours a week and I already pay for the bills and food. She said that's not fair if I get to enjoy my gym membership and hobbies like video games but the difference is I'm paying for them with my money. My wife said her inheritance was worth more than if she spent her whole life working and without that, both of us would be working anyway and having higher expenses from paying a mortgage and car loans so I should count that as her contribution and share my money with her.

They are both great kids that are successful, accomplished and I couldn't be more proud, but lead very different lives.  We all still live in the same area, the area I raised them at.  One (F25) travels extensively for work and has an on again off again boyfriend and the other (F28) is married and has a 3 month old son.   My daughter with the 3 month old works full time and is going back to work as her maternity leave is ending.  I work part time but offered to watch my grandson at my house while they are at work.  I'd quit my job, which I'm okay doing. We recently had a sit down about watching him and my daughter and husband gave me a list of rules, one they stressed was no animals around the baby.  That one was a bit of a surprise and conflicts with the needs of my other daughter. I asked why, they cited safety.  I accepted them, because I want to watch my grandson and be involved in his life.  My other daughter that travels for work has a pair of dogs. When she is out of town, she drops the dogs off with me.  The dogs can be a bit rambunctious but otherwise behaved.  She is usually gone 3 days at a time, usually midweek.  So the time that I watch the dogs would conflict with my grandson.  I've been watching her dogs for 3 years.  I've informed her that I want to watch my Grandson and because of that I can't watch the dogs as much anymore.  Well she did not take that news well and flipped out.  Says it isn't fair that she now has to find other means to take care of the dogs and it is financially affecting her. I told her I can stop by and check on them in the evenings, but I won't have the time to properly take care of her dogs if they were left at her place. She hasn't spoken to me or her sister in the past week.    So was i the asshole here?",

His widow/wife aka sister inlaw has never really been on good terms with my inlaws/her inlaws. They were having issues in the past and now from what I gather, my mother inlaw is planning on going to court for grandparents rights to get visitation of the kids. My inlaws had been asking my sister inlaw to give them my brother inlaw's wedding ring so they could keep it. She refused and they got into a huge argument then she left with the kids. They went over to her home yesterday hoping to take the ring from her but she told them she didn't have it, and that she buried it with my brother inlaw. When my parents inlaw mentioned this and were devastated, I suggested that she might just be lying to get them to drop it. Suddenly, they got up and quickly got into their cars and went over to her house and had another huge argument there. Sister inlaw called me later cussing at me saying I was horrible to be basically meddling in her life and encouraging my inlaws to come after her and harrass her. I argued that I only made a suggestion and that her real issue was with them. She hung up after telling me to mind my own business and stop getting involved. My husband berated me for what I said and said that his parents are crazy, and that I shouldn't approve of their behavior or even help them harrass my grieving sister inlaw. I mean my parents inlaw are also grieving and I, too, am grieving and my sister inlaw's words hurt me when all I did was just make a suggestion when I saw how devastated my parents inlaw were.

He had no problem with that, and he still drinks with his friends, but won't do that in my presence. It still bothers me that he drinks, but it's his life, I can't tell him what to do. Fast forward to last Sunday, and we're at his apartment. I come in, and he's in the middle of making pasta sauce, and there's a large bottle of vodka on the counter. I didn't say anything about the bottle, but he saw me staring at it, and he told me it's for the sauce. Pasta sauce he's made me at least twice a month for the entirety of our relationship. He said he's told me from the beginning he does that, that it cooks away, but I think that would be something I would very much remember, and I got a little angry. I knocked the bottle off the counter and went to my mom's. He's called and apologized for triggering me, and that he was being brainless, but he wants me to pay for the broken bottle, which he says was about an $80 brand. I told him that I wasn't under any circumstances going to pay for something he's been lacing my food with for years. We haven't really talked since, and my mom wants me to just go ahead and buy the thing to make amends, and I'm still refusing. AITA? Edit: I didn't smash the bottle, I pushed it off the counter and it broke. I didn't throw it.  Edit2: alright, I get it. I'm going to get him $80 worth of stuff to make up for it.

        "selftext": "So my 20 year old daughter is currently a college student. She lives in my house free of rent. I only ask her to do a few things around the house from time to time, like cooking and cleaning. Typical things you're expected to do on a daily basis anyways. Occasionally she has to watch over her younger brothers since I may be busy with work or when I need a break to hang out with my girlfriend.  My daughter recently spoke up to me about how she feels I'm putting too much of a workload on her back which I don't see how. She told me she's okay with cooking and cleaning around the house, but having to watch over her siblings was annoying & stressful and that it's taking away from her studies. That pissed me off because I myself went to school while having to pay bills & take care of her as a baby alongside my ex-wife. I told her she was acting very privileged and that if I could do it, so could she. She didn't like that very much and stormed off into her room.  Well she went behind my back and told my sister about how bad I was treating her. My sister is very kind & gullible at times, so she called me and said the least I could do was give her an allowance for the chores I make her do. I explained why I felt that wasn't necessary and she told me not to compare my situation to my Daughter's since apparently I put myself in the position I was in back then which I guess is a fair argument. But since she is living in my house rent free and I'm paying for her college, I feel that in of itself should count as an allowance. So I just wanted to ask whether I'm wrong for not wanting to pay her extra money to do basic chores. Edit: So in regards to how often I ask her to babysit, it's usually 3 times a week. I don't see how that's too much to ask of her. It's usually only for a few hours until I get back home. My boys are twins & they're 5 years old. They aren't crazy kids by the way, they're more mature than the typical one's you'll see.",

I do have one friend \u201cMel\u201d (20f) that I had to exclude from the wedding.

Now as an adult, I feel like I have a responsibility to prevent underage drinking, and as the bride, I feel like I have the right to have a childfree wedding. Mel is unconvinced and keeps talking bad about me behind my back to our mutual friends and making snarky comments about me feeling superior.

I caved in eventually but told him we'd have a small, secret celebration so that my family wouldn't find out. He agreed. The next day, I got a call from mom and she was so upset saying that my word meant nothing and that I have no respect for my brother's memory nor the family. I asked what she meant and she told me she saw the birthday party pics my husband posted on social media. I was to shocked to even argue. I hung up and went straight to my husband to confront him about it. He got defensive and said that he didn't need my permission to post pics, and that he wanted to show his family the birthday celebration pics since I insisted we have a small, secret party and exclude them. I explained to him how this made me look bad and a liar to my family but he said they can get over it and called my mom snooby. I blew up at him and we had a huge fight about it. He started sulking later and said I ruined the memory of our daughter's first birthday for him and verbally abused him with how I lashed out. But I solely did it out of frusrtation knowing that what happened caused a massive problem between me and family. Now he's expecting an apology from me. AITA?",

        "selftext": "My ex husband and I share custody of our 10 year old daughter and 12 year old son. We have a 2-2-3 schedule which usually looks like I have the kids Friday after school and then he gets them Monday after school. I get them back Wednesday after school and then he gets them Friday after school and then the week flip flops. We've done this since our divorce 5 years ago and it works well. I'm a nurse in the OR so I schedule my shifts for the days during the week when they are with their dad and my one call weekend every 6 weeks is a weekend they are with their dad.  Recently, the kids said they want to try splitting up on the weekends, so instead of both of them being with one us during the weekend, one will go with dad and one will be with me. My son said he would make sure he was with me on call weekends because he can stay by himself if I have to get called in or can hang out at the hospital until I'm done. My ex is on board with this because he says it will allow us to spend one on one time with the kids and will allow the kids a break from each other (they squabble occasionally and annoy one another). While they have a point- sometimes it is hard to not feel like you are disappointing one by trying to accommodate the other, I do not want to give up my free weekends. It took me a few months to get used to not having my kids all the time after the divorce but now my weekends without them are filled with activities or travel. My ex agreed if there was a weekend trip I wanted to take he would be fine having both the kids that weekend but I honestly don't want to have to take his schedule into consideration when planning my trips, and sometimes they are spontaneous trips.  I was talking to my family about this at breakfast this morning and they are all kind of appalled by me not wanting to do this. My sister pointed out that if I was still married, then I wouldn't have all the child free time I have now and many mothers don't get a break from their kids like I do. My mom said she can't believe I'd deny my children quality time with their parents for selfish reasons like not wanting to give up my weekends. My SIL seemed to understand where I was coming from but said that she would still do it and just incorporate the child into whatever I was doing and pointed out my daughter would love to go on the NYC shopping trip I had planned for December and my son would happily join me for my Saturday morning spin classes. I considered that but my SIL loves taking her kids everywhere so I don't know that she is aware of how nice it is to just be an adult without the responsibility of a child wherever you go. They were really making me feel like an asshole though. AITA?",

So few weeks ago a lady had booked me for a party makeup on June 25th. She booked at 10am. I went there thinking I'd do a regular party makeup. I had agreed $150 with her. As I was there, there were some people coming over. I assume relatives. At some point it slips from a woman about the wedding and I realise the woman I'm doing the makeup on is the bride. I'm doing a bridal makeup charging for simple party makeup. I was completely pissed how she lied about the occasion but I kept doing my job. After we were finished. She gave me $150 and I notified her we are actually $350 short. She asked what I meant by that and I said that I did a bridal makeup. You're the bride. That's what I charge for bride's. She said we had agreed on a simpla party makeup and that I am basically ripping her off because I worked the same amount of time and used the same products as I'd use in a bridal makeup so the title of the event shouldn't matter. I told her she doesn't get to dictate how I form my prices. She then refused to pay me at all and called me a scammer and told me to get out. Before I left her mom threw $200 on my face and told me to get lost. I was telling what happened to my friends and they all sided with the bride and said that unless I used more expensive products and I did extra labor then I'm not justified in charging her more and since she requested party makeup I should just charge her that.

If they are worried about their kid they should get a sitter and leave him at home. My gf got pissed and said I was being unreasonable because the flu shot was inexpensive and you can easily get them at a CVS. I am all about vaccinations, but I am not a fan of being told I need to do something for someone else's peace of mind. Edit: Quick edit, that I thought was obvious. I am not going to go if the baby will be there, and I don't have my shot. I don't want to get a baby sick/possibly die. I may still be the A**hole, but I am not heartless.

Instead of watching I should\u2019ve said taking care of the house and kids. Her going to the beach is what I thought she wanted to do for Mother\u2019s Day and me taking care of everything was enough because we pretty much split everything 50/50, she cooks more and I clean more. She wasn\u2019t expecting gifts but acknowledgement of her is what she was looking for but again her being gone that day I thought that it didn\u2019t mean that much and wasn\u2019t expecting anything. She didn\u2019t speak to me for 4 days after I apologized. Eventually we talked it out and admitted my mistakes for not communicating with her.

She instantly tells me that she doesn't know why he never changed it but I can decline or sign the cheque over to her once I receive it.. Instantly I am in shock, he's gone? And he left me on there? Why? I went back and forth wondering if this was on purpose or accidental.. it had been years, approximately 6 since we mutually civily split up. I was informed he had a new gf that lived with him and she has 2 kids from a previous relationship that threw a wrench into things more.. is there a reason she never got put on it? Was this all just a big mistake? Today it has been 1 week and this has been very hard especially since his mom has been terrorizing me all week trying to get me to agree to give her this money. She has said the most hurtful things, and has sent me the most disrespectful photos and video of her son in his last moments..As of right now I haven't even gotten in touch with the insurance company, I have no idea how much this is or if I need a lawyers help at this point.  Well today is the day I woke up knowing 100% I am keeping this money and I am not going to feel bad at all for helping my family with a gift my ex left for me. Unfortunately part of me still wonders if it's the right thing to do by my ex.. and if these were his wishes in the end. A little info too add, my home burnt too the ground 3 years ago July 20th and October 1st 2 years ago my mom passed from cancer as well... it has been a long hard few years and this money would literally buy myself a new bra for the first time in 3 years.. my little clan could really use this money and I think my ex knew that..

        "selftext": "I am 19M, and my sister (22F) got married about a week ago. She was rather mean to me growing up, and I still don't like her very much. Several months ago, we were all having dinner as a family. I was asked by my sister if I could be the organist for her wedding. She told me that she can't pay me, but that I can have food at the buffet. Since most of the gigs that I do are paying ones, I initially said that she's going to have to pay me. But my parents got mad at me and told me that it's unreasonable to expect family to pay me for playing music. I asked my sister if there'll be vegan options for her buffet, and she told me that she'll make sure that there will be. So I gave in and agreed to play as long as she has vegan options for me. When I arrived on the day of the wedding, my sister came over and told me that she wasn't able to get any vegan options for the buffet, so she got an Impossible Whopper for me from Burger King on her way there. Not only was that completely insulting, it has mayo in it so it isn't even vegan. I told her that I'm not going to play for the wedding unless she sends me $200 on Venmo right now. She went and discussed it with her fianc\u00e9, only to be told that she can't do that. So I immediately left the wedding and muted my sister, her fianc\u00e9, and my parents on my phone. There was no music for the wedding ceremony. I went to go see a movie with my friends instead. When I got home, my parents were predictably very angry and screaming at me. But I refused to apologize. I honestly don't care that much what they think anymore at this point because I'm already moving out in less than a month. My sister is now demanding that I reimburse her $2500 for the organ rental, and is threatening to take me to small claims court. I told her to pound sand because not only was there no contract, she didn't even uphold her end of our verbal agreement.",

My eldest is married to Steve while my youngest is engaged to Adam. Steve and Adam are so different they disliked each other the first time they met. Steve works part time because he treasures family time with my daughter. They spend their time traveling and exploring different parts of the states. He spends freely because he often say he can\u2019t take his money with him when he dies.  Adam is an executive and for his side business, he owns several dozen properties. He works about 80 hours a week at both jobs because his philosophy is that he wants to make as much money as possible while he\u2019s young so that he can retire early. Steve thinks Adam is a corporate shill and basically blames him for everything that\u2019s wrong with society. Steve said that Adam is actively keeping people from buying homes and making them dependent on him. Adam thinks Steve is a slacker and have told Steve people like him who does the bare minimum but expects hand outs are what\u2019s wrong with society. Neither of them are bad and they treat my daughters well.  I retired last year due to my health so Adam built a house for me so that I can live comfortably. I was able to customize everything in the house to fit my taste. Adam owns the house, pays for all of the utilities, and charges me $1 a month for rent. Part of our deal is that no one else can live in the house but me. He was very clear about this. Steve recently lost his job so he and my eldest are living off of her single income. As you can imagine, they are struggling. My eldest recently called me crying because their savings are almost gone and they can\u2019t make next month\u2019s rent. She asked if she and Steve could move in with me until he finds another job. I live on a fixed income so I don\u2019t have money to set them up in another apartment. She\u2019s my daughter and I couldn\u2019t let her be homeless so I let Steve and her move in. I gave them strict rules and a time limit on when they had to move out. I didn\u2019t think my youngest and Adam would find out because they live in another state but somehow she found out. She called and screamed at me last night for betraying Adam\u2019s trust but I argued that I\u2019m a mother to 2 daughters and I can\u2019t let one be homeless. I told her about the rules and time limit and begged her not to tell Adam. She hung up on me so I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen. I know I went back on an agreement but I had a good reason. Edit I couldn\u2019t add many details in my original post because I was afraid of going over the character limits.  Adam pays the taxes and utilities on this house but because it\u2019s the only house he has in this state, he keeps its financials separate from the rest of his properties. Also, he doesn\u2019t really have anything to do with the house. Instead, he gave it over to my youngest to take care of so she handles all of the bills and maintenance and pays them out of an account he set up. She noticed the increased utility cost which is when she called.  We just spoke again and I laid my soul bare to her. I knew I was going back on our agreement but it was to keep her sister from being homeless. We had a lengthy conversation and in the end, she agreed not to tell Adam. She\u2019ll cover the increased utility cost out of her own pocket so he won\u2019t notice it. In exchange, her sister and Steve will have 3 months then will have to move out. I originally told them they had 6 months.  I\u2019m lucky to have such a compassionate daughter. Thank you for taking the time to read my post. Some of the comments were very hurtful but some were helpful. You made me realize I should have called my youngest at the start and asked. That would have saved alot of tears.",

My husband uses Reddit and thought this sub would provide a third insight that we are missing. My husband (42M) and I (40F) have 2 daughters: Jane (22F) and Lisa (5F). This concerns Jane who has been struggling with the cold. Jane started to complain about the temperature of the house now it\u2019s no longer summertime. Currently, we leave the central heating off all the time apart from in the early morning (5-7am) so Lisa doesn\u2019t get too cold when she is awake. My husband and I don\u2019t have an issue with the temperature of the house (its approx 16C at night across all of the bedrooms since we checked in case her room was draftier), we don\u2019t really feel it and do not see where Jane is coming from. Jane complains and says she wears multiple layers to bed and around the house while we are all asleep. So, she asked if she could have access to the thermostat in order to switch the heating on at a higher temperature than 18C (what we set it as). She wants to raise it to 21C but we said no. She keeps complaining about how she has to wear 4 layers to bed so she doesn\u2019t feel cold in the morning. Lisa says it isn\u2019t cold when we ask her, my husband and I also don\u2018t feel the cold so we said no to her asking and thought that would put an end to it. It did not. We had dinner at my parents house in which Jane was making comments about how warm and toasty her grandparents\u2019 house is. My parents were shocked that we didn\u2019t allow her access to the thermostat and they tried to sway us into giving her access because it isn\u2019t right for her to sleep in multiple layers. My sister also agreed with them and said my daughter has valid points since the temperature is starting to drop in the night. Are we wrong here?    Hello everyone and thank you for all your feedback. I did not realise there were so many reasons as to why my daughter potentially could be cold and that layering may not work in those cases. We reached a compromise with our daughter: she can have a small heater for her room with a timer so I am 100% sure it is not left on overnight for my own peace of mind. We are also going to buy her a heavier duvet and thicker mattress topper to prevent cold from underneath the bed. Thank you all. ",

        "selftext": "My (27F) fiance (29M) is an extremely picky eater, and lately, I\u2019ve been feeling really frustrated with his extreme pickiness when it comes to food. He has a very limited diet and refuses to try anything outside of his comfort zone. He doesn't eat meat or vegetables, his diet typically consists of stuff like pizza, macaroni, cereal, and bread with the occasional fruit on the side. This has made it extremely frustrating whenever we eat out. If we're getting something to eat, we have to only go to places that serve anything he wants, which limits our options to mostly just fast food or pizza places. He's offered to go out to other restaurants with me, but he never ends up ordering anything when we do and it's extremely embarrassing. He never eats anything I cook, and typically just sticks to making his own food. This came to a head when we visited my parents last week. We sat down to eat together, they know he doesn't eat meat so prepared a vegetable dish. When we were eating, he only ate a small portion of it, and I could tell from how little he had eaten he wasn't going to finish it. My parents asked what was wrong, and he thanked them for the food, but said he just wasn't that hungry and ended up just fiddling with the rest of it and threw most of it out after dinner. I was mortified. On the way back, he wanted to stop and get food and I kind of laid into him. I told him he embarrassed me, was rude to my parents to not eat the dish, and that he seriously needs to grow up and stop eating like a manchild. This isn't the first time we've had an argument about this, but it is the first time I've been this mad. Last summer we visited my extended family at my uncle's lakehouse, and he basically only ate frozen pizza and cereal the three days we were there, which caused issues since my nieces and nephews were there and I felt it set a bad example for them. He got really hurt and hasn't talked to me much for the past few days. I feel bad, but at the same time, I'm just tired of this. So, AITA? I feel I could have been nicer and more accomodating, but it's not like he has a medical condition that forces him to eat this way. I'm just so tired with him not even being willing to try and continuing to eat like a 5 year old.",

        "selftext": "For context: I 39, got married to my wife Nelly 36, months ago. I have to say that Nelly and my daughter (her stepdaughter) Megan 16, never gotten along. They have lots of disagreements and nothing in common and it was obvious since the first say they met but I didn't do anything about it thinking they'd move past their differences and warm up to each other the longer they spend time together. I was wrong because once we moved in together the fights got worse. Nelly would complain from Megan throwing away stuff of her's just because she thought it didn't belong there. It's been basically a mouse and cat game and I've lost track on who's right and who's wrong. I did try tk establish some boundaries to try to bring back peace to my home and had them agree that each stays in their own lane and not bother each other. Nelly said that I was wrong tk think that what Megan is doing is okay but I told her to let it slide. Nelly has especial type of haircare products for her sensitive hair. Shampoo, conditioner etc etc. She put them in the bathroom but Megan ended up throwing them away saying that Nelly had no right to store her products in the bathroom cause it's not her house. To keep the peace I asked Nelly to just keep her stuff in the bedroom and take it with her whenever she wants to take a shower to which she agreed. Last night Nelly took a shower and forgot her hair products in the bathroom. Megan ended up going in there and then the shampoo collection was gone. Nelly freaked out and then had a fight after Megan told her she dumped them out saying she already warned her about leaving her stuff laying around in the bathroom. Nelly broke down and when I said I choose to stay out of this because of how petty it was, she blew up at me. She yelled about how I keep letting Megan get away with bad attitude and unjustified misbehavior. Told me to stop enabling her and start setting consequences for her actions. I told her she shouldve been more careful knowing how Megan is so I feel like this was preventable. but she said that she forgot her stuff there and didn't think Megan would go that far. We had an argument and that was it. Megan is acting nonchalant sdespite me talking to her and Nelly went tj stay with her parents saying I need to step up and do something.",

        "selftext": "Throwaway because. Last weekend was my (M28) birthday. My girlfriend (F25) had asked what I wanted to do and I said I wanted to watch my favorite movie trilogy, LOTR. I don't think my girlfriend was thrilled but she didn't say anything and agreed. She has seen them before and I don't think she really likes them very much but she knows I love them so she doesn't really say anything besides they aren't really her thing.  But I really wanted to make a day of watching them and I went over to her house because she has a really big comfortable couch.  About ten minutes into the first movie and I look over and she is browsing on her phone. I was a little miffed but didn't say anything. She basically scrolled through her phone the entire movie. When we started the second movie, she opened a bottle of wine and proceeded to drink the whole thing, while still sitting on her phone. I was pretty irritated at this point because she wasn't even paying attention at all.  The third movie started and by then she had opened another bottle of wine and was asleep within the first twenty minutes. I was really mad at that point and just left and went home.  A few hours later I got a text asking where I went. I told her I was mad that she couldn't pay attention to my favorite movies on my birthday. She told me I was an asshole and to grow the hell up. I've texted her a couple times but she hasn't responded. AITA? Edit: This has really blown up and I've gotten a little overwhelmed, but I do accept that I was the asshole. Watching 9 hours of movies that she hates was definitely too much of an ask and I shouldn't have reacted the way I did. I just took it personally because I felt like she didn't even try and these movies are important to me. The fact that she isn't much of a drinker and drank this much kind of set me off. I called and left her a voicemail apologizing.",

He's made it clear he is just not interested in spending time with his nephew, keeps saying that the reason for that is that he's actually child free. for so many emergencies he has turned me and my wife away when we begged him to watch our son  and he didn't even budge or apologize for his attitude. it all came to head a couple of days ago, I had a work meeting while my wife was out of town and my inlaws were attending a wedding so no one was free to watch my son except for my BIL. I showed up to his place and told him I was desperate for help and needed him to just watch my son for 2 hours. he refused, even suggested I take him with me to work but that's not a good suggestion. I begged him and he just said no. I had enough I confronted him and asked why? does he not like his nephew and he threw that no it's just that I'm child free excuse which made me lose it. I told him to just stop because it's cringe of him to keep saying that and use it as an excuse to be unsupportive of me and his sister and cold towards his nephew. I told him he should really do better and stop being so negative but he got mad and said I had no right to disrespect his lifestyle/choices but it's the attitude that gets me. we had a exchange of words where he said my son isn't his responsibility whatsoever then I left. he complained to my inlaws and they called me out for disrespecting their son and treating him like that. They insisted that he's not responsible for my son and I shouldn't expect so much from him then guilt him about it. they wanted me to apologize and my wife said I should but he was about as helpful and supportive as a rock so, I decided I will take my time before I consider apologizing.

        "selftext": "My 24 f bridsemaid / cousin Ella 26 f is to be in my wedding party in June. The ongoing issue is that my wedding has a blue and green peacock theme and guests have been asked to follow this colour scheme with their clothes. Hair wasn't originally included at all in the colour scheme but my cousin Ella has natural bright ginger hair. I would never ask someone to permemnantly change their hair for my wedding,  I know that would be bonkers so I suggested some temporary hair dye, but Ella argued that she has been growing her hair for 6 years and doesn't want to risk the colour not washing out. I thought this was ridiculous because it literally says washes out in like 14 washes.But Ella says because her hair is completely natural colour it might take strongly to her hair.  So I gave up on that avenue and suggested a wig, it is 1 day 1 single day and there are some amazing wigs these days,  I had a look on Instagram and you wouldn't even be able to tell. But she said she would feel self conscious and weird wearing a wig and that because her hair is butt length that it might sit weird on her head.So she won't dye it,  and won't cover it up. I really don't want to come across as a bridezilla but butt length flaming red hair will destroy the wedding photos,  and ruin the colour scheme completely.  Im at a loss, I can't cut her from the wedding because my mom would murder me but I can't have freaking Merida ruining the photos, AITA for asking this of her for just 1 single day? tl;dr   bridesmaid has flaming red hair and refusing to hide it for one single day for my wedding that has a colour scheme it will clash with aita EDIT: Ella has dropped out of the wedding because we couldn't reach a compromise so it doesn't matter anymore. I now have to deal with my mom and aunt chewing me out over it all. EDIT: OK I get it jesus iata please leave it be now, I decided to link ella this post as it hit twitter and i was worried she would hear about it anyway,  we will be working to reach a compromise.",

I don't work so I don't have everything I need for my daily skin/hair routine so I borrow stuff from Claire. Claire didn't have an issue in the beginning but then started complaining about me randomly walking into her room but I go in there looking for the stuff I asked for. She gave me a hard time just because I walked in on Thomas half naked to get the eye shadow I borrowed from her. and then that other time when I walked in late at night. She told me I nedded to get her permission to enter the room before I take anything but I figured this would make things complicated. It's enough that I have to ask to borrow an item. So, last night at around 10pm I went upstairs and into her bedroom to grab the hair dryer. I walked it and woops, I saw them in an intimate position together in bed. I had NO IDEA they're were doing it, especially since Claire told me that Thomas has been feeling sick the past 2 days. She lashed out at me yelling that I get out. I quickly grabbed the hair dryer then walked out and shut the door. minutes later, She came downstairs in her robe and went off on me saying she was done with me repeatedly disrespecting and violating hers and her husband's privacy. I told her it was cool, no big deal. and that I needed the dryer but didn't have time to ask for permissin. She got even louder saying I had no business barging into her marital space and embarrassing her and her husband like this. I told her that I was sorry but she really overreacted to this whole thing. This made her more pissed she went on about how I'm living here rent free and yet not being respectable enough. I stopped arguing and went to my room. This morning, Thomas left the house early amd Claire ignored me on breakfast. Still upset saying I don't get to say wether she overreacted or not and that my behavior was inappropriate. She even wants me to apologize to her husband for making last night awkward.",

        "selftext": "My MIL has made a small family quilt for all of her kids and their spouses (5 couples including us). The quilt is really cute, has the couple's names, their kids' names, and their favorite hobbies and things all done in stitching and cute little cloth pictures. I was really looking forward to getting ours because I admit I'm a bit of a hipster and I love home-made kitschy stuff like that for our home. She recently finished her latest one for my husband's brother and I thought we were getting ours soon since my husband is the youngest. I asked my SIL (she got hers first) and she very awkwardly informed me that no such quilt will be coming our way. I was a bit upset and asked my husband to investigate. Turns out MIL has no intention of making a quilt for us because there's not enough to put on all the squares or whatever, basically meaning since we don't have kids we don't deserve a quilt because she can't be bothered. I message her directly about it because I'm just that kind of person. I like hearing it straight from the other guy. MIL says her fingers hurt after the first 4 quilts and she's taking a break. I ask her if it has anything to do with the fact that we have no kids (which she expressed negativity against in the past) and she says no even though I know it's a lie. I push her more and ask her when she thinks the quilt will be done after her little break and she kind of loses her temper and says there's no quilt and there never will be a quilt. I ask why and she says she's only interest in making quilts with her grandkids and things on them and we don't have enough hobbies and kids' hobbies to fill up a whole quilt. I tell her we have 2 beautiful dogs whom we love and could be put on there and she says I'm not making a whole quilt for a couple of goddamn dogs verbatim. I hang up and tell my husband and he's 100% on my side. But now I got a really mean voice message from my SIL telling me that I crossed the line and am acting like a huge B*tch for no reason. I'm shocked because I have a great relationship with my SIL and she always defended me from other family bullshit. My husband wants no part in this now. AITA for what I said to my MIL?",

This friend's parents were doing my wife and I a huge favor, because my wife's father had surgery yesterday, and we needed to be there and didn't get home until after midnight. So yes, this story begins with us already in debt to them. Anyway, at naptime today my son started freaking out because he couldn't find sleepy Dumbo (his stuffed animal) and he *cannot* sleep without sleepy Dumbo. I remembered that when I picked him up I didn't see sleepy Dumbo. So I text the mom and dad of the friend. I get no response. My wife is a wreck, so I'm not bothering her with this, but my son is freaking out. So I tell him we will get in the car and go get sleepy Dumbo and he slightly calmed down. So we drive over and I try to call them both on the way. When we get there, I knock, and we wait a bit with no answer. At this point my son starts freaking out more because he is afraid something happened to sleepy Dumbo. I try to reassure him, but he starts crying. I knock again, and the wife of the couple answers. She says she is working and asks what I want. I explain about sleepy Dumbo. She again says she is working, and she says she doesn't have time to look for Dumbo and tells us to come back later. My son starts freaking out more. I ask if we can look. She says she needs to focus. I promise to be fast. She lets me in. We get to his friend's room, sleepy Dumbo is on the bed. My son gets him, and I hustle us out. I thank the mom, but she is glaring at me. On the way home he hugs sleepy Dumbo the whole time. I remind him to be more careful with sleepy Dumbo in the future, and at home naptime commences peacefully. About an hour ago my wife and I both got this text. I'm going to copy paste it: {Me} and {my wife} I really don't appreciate the way {me} barged into my house earlier today while I was working. I know you both have a lot going on right now but the world doesn't revolve around you. {Her husband} and I agreed to do you a favor but that doesn't mean you get to just walk all over us. In the future if you call and we don't answer that means it isn't a good time to come over. I felt very embarrassed and guilty after reading that. My wife, however, is furious. She called the wife of the other couple some indelicate names. I am really grateful to them for agreeing to babysit for us, and I accept that I am to blame for forgetting sleepy Dumbo the first time. I don't know if asking to come in and get him is quite as big a deal as she's making it out though, and my wife is pissed. I don't know how much of that is misplaced fear for her dad though.

Alice has four kids and is currently expecting child number five, while Miranda can\u2019t have children which her ex divorced her for. Miranda is very successful in life, she has a nice apartment, works a good job and earns a decent amount of money. Alice, on the other hand, is struggling financially. She had her first kid right out of high school and got pregnant with her second child soon after, so she decided to become a SAHM to her children while her boyfriend provides for them. Me and my parents try to help them out as much as possible, be it childcare or money, whatever she needs. I love my nieces and nephews. I take them to the park and play with the older ones, I really enjoy it. Miranda doesn\u2019t help out with them, she says it\u2019s because she\u2019s too busy. Well, she works long hours, but she doesn\u2019t have kids, so I don\u2019t know what she does on weekends. She also doesn\u2019t help out financially, which I find unfair, since she makes so much money and all she does is spend it on herself, although she does give us very nice gifts for Christmas and birthdays. My parents nag her about it, saying she should give some of her money to Alice monthly, and I agree with that. So, here comes the part where I may have been an asshole. I was at Miranda\u2019s place last week, as she baked muffins and invited me over to eat some and catch up. We got on the topic of Christmas presents and I told her some of the stuff I wanted. She nodded and said she would give our parents a coupon for a much needed vacation and Alice some clothes she had mentioned and also some new boots and jackets for her kids. I was a little stunned she didn\u2019t have more for Alice, so I asked, \u201cWhy do you only get Alice the bare minimum? You can afford to help out more and you refuse to out of spite.\u201d Miranda looked at me and laughed. She said it wasn\u2019t her business to feed six people, that Alice was old enough to make her choices and live with the consequences. She knew what she was getting herself into and that she wouldn\u2019t pay Alice\u2019s way through life just because she kept having children she couldn\u2019t afford. I was stunned at how cold she reacted. I asked her how she could live her life being so selfish and uncaring, and she got angry and told me, \u201cListen, kid, there are some thing you are way too young for to be discussing with me, and this is one of those. Drop the subject or get out.\u201d I got really frustrated with her and said something I probably shouldn\u2019t have. I told her, \u201cNo wonder your husband divorced you, even if you could have children, you would be a terrible mother.\u201d Miranda got very quiet and told me to leave and never come back. She has now blocked me on everything, and though I don\u2019t agree with her not helping out, I\u2019m starting to feel guilty for what I said. So, AITA?",

This has worked out well so far, but lately it has been taking a toll on me. I pay Hannah child support every month, ever since Stacey had our first child she has demanded that I give her the same amount of money each month to keep things fair. In addition, I have to pay for half of our joint household expenses (ie mortgage, utilities, food) and my own car. Stacey pays for the majority of expenses for our children.  Here lies the problem. Stacey has never taking issues with having to care for mine and Hannah's children. She picks them up from school, takes them to activities, and ensures they have everything they need. However, anytime she purchases anything for them, she immediately sends me a Venmo request and demands I cover all expenses related to children that are not hers. We recently went on a family vacation and she demanded that I pay for half of the portion for our children and all of the portion for Hannah's. I told her that all theses expenses are taking a hit in my finances and she didn't seem to care. She reiterated that my children are my responsibility. To add insult to injury, she recently started contributing money to college funds for her kids, while Hannah and I have nothing saved for our kids' college. Hannah found out and asked that I start funds for our kids. When I talked with Stacey about this, she said this was fine, but I had to put the same amount of money in the funds she has set up for our kids. I told Stacey I need her to start paying her fair share of expenses around our household. I cannot afford to pay child support, household expenses, and all these miscellaneous expenses that come up for my kids. It wouldn't hurt her financially, as she makes more than me and could easily spare some money. Stacey blew up and took our children to her parent's house and I haven't heard from her in a day and a half. Am I the asshole for demanding that she pay her fair share?",

The houses also stick out horribly in terms of aesthetics \u2013 think single level brick homes with a 3-level gigantic white and black box in the middle. My home\u2019s been in my family for several generations. We have always been known for having a large, beautiful garden. We invited over kids to help with gardening, we gave away so many veggies, we\u2019d hold parties, etc. It\u2019s been a neighborhood treasure for years. Until developers snatched up the lot next door, bulldozed and erected an enormous house that blocked out the light to most of the garden. Many of us tried to fight it with the city but everything was denied. It was heartbreaking. Our neighborhood has been changed forever. This was a link to my family and I almost have had to go through a grieving process for it. The new owners moved in and were not welcomed warmly by people in the neighborhood. I avoided them for as long as I could, other than politely waving or nodding. It was a young couple in their early 20s. We finally came face to face and the woman asked if we could chat. She said that they felt like maybe they\u2019d done something wrong when they moved in, or if they aren\u2019t pulling in their trash bins or something, being too loud, etc, because people haven\u2019t been very friendly. The guy says that he\u2019s surprised considering it felt like a \u201cnice\u201d and somewhat \u201caffluent\u201d neighborhood, and given the price, he was expecting friendly neighbors. I asked if they had done any research about the area. They said that they moved from California, so no. I said that maybe that was their mistake? They said they didn\u2019t know what I meant, so I asked if they\u2019d ever looked in our backyard. They said yes and said they think the garden is cute. I said \u201cYes, the garden that now has about half less sunlight than before that house was built was a neighborhood treasure. The guy said \u201cWell it\u2019s not our fault you built the garden there, is it?\u201d I said \u201cWell, you guys got what you paid for. 2 million dollars for a house that everyone in the neighborhood hates.\u201d I said that I hoped it was worth it and wished them a nice day.

I don't have any issue with my brother being gay, but I have one with him wearing a wedding ring in order to pretend that he's married to him. You see, we live in a country where gay marriage still isn't allowed (Romania), but despite this, my brother and his boyfriend started wearing weddings rings recently. When I asked my brother about it, he told me that despite not being able to do it legally, they already consider themselves married spiritually and they're hoping that one day gay marriages will be allowed to do legally as well, either by leaving the country or waiting till gay marriages are made legal here as well. While I think this nice, I told him that they shouldn't be wearing wedding rings till they actually get officially married, as I think it's kind of distasteful. He told me that they're just a symbol of their love and that they're not hurting anyone by wearing them, but I disagreed, they're actively misleading people into thinking that they're actually married and frankly just making a mockery out of marriage.  My brother told me that he doesn't care what other people, including me, think about them wearing wedding rings and maybe they should just mind their own business, then left furiously. Not gonna lie, I think his comment here was kind of out of line, as all I did was to give my opinion on people wearing wedding rings when they're actually married yet and he seemed to take it personally. His boyfriend also contacted me later and told me that their romantic lives doesn't concern me and to stay out of it. AITA ?",

Their mother and I agreed on a 50/50 custody arrangement after we split up and have stuck to it until this issue arose. My daughter hasn\u2019t spoken to me since last summer due to an argument she and I had about college.\r  \r  I have college funds for all 3 of my kids, and had an agreement with them that they would receive it after graduating high school as long as they attended a state university (not community college). I wanted to set them up for success later on, and I knew future employers would take them more seriously if their degree was from a legitimate 4-year college.\r  \r  Last Spring my daughter and I got into an argument about this. She was filling out financial forms for college and asked me for my tax returns. While we were going over the forms I noticed that she put down a local community college, and when I pointed it out she told me that her mother encouraged her to because they waived the tuition fees for first time college students so we wouldn\u2019t have to pay for any of it.\r  \r  I told her that she shouldn\u2019t be asking me for my information if she was going to use it to do something that I\u2019ve made clear I don\u2019t support. She told me that she thought I just meant I was against paying for it and I told her that I had been crystal clear and that she knew what I had meant, and that she was being sneaky and taking the easy way out.\r  \r  Eventually I stormed out. I figured that it would blow over by the next day, as it usually does when we have a fight. However, she told me a few days later that she reached out to the financial aid company and asked to submit the forms with only her mother\u2019s financial information. \r  \r  They ended up approving her request but it was a long process and didn\u2019t get completed until after the deadline to enroll in most universities for the fall semester. As a result, she wasn\u2019t able to start college last semester and ended up getting a job instead. My daughter told me that since I \u201cclearly wasn\u2019t going to help her\u201d, that she would move in with her mother full time after she turned 18 (which was during the summer) and she started college this semester.\r  \r  I told her that was ridiculous and that she was being petty, and that she sabotaged herself and if she had just enrolled in a real college like I told her to, she would\u2019ve been able to complete the paperwork without a problem. She told me that she hated me and was cold and distant to me until she moved out permanently.\r  \r  That was all during Spring and Summer of last year and my daughter hasn\u2019t spoken to me since. I pretty much forgot about it until my youngest son told me this morning that he misses her being there when they spend the week at my house and how he wishes I hadn't been so harsh. In retrospect, I might HAVE been too harsh with it. AITA?\r  \r  ",

Unlike a lot of women, she didn't have any reconstructive surgery. This was before I met her.  I'm a big anime nerd, and last weekend I invited her to a small anime con with me. She's seen a few episodes of my favorite shows, but she's not into anime; she does like cosplay, though, and she works seasonally as an SFX artist at a haunted house near us. So when I asked her to go to the con with me, she asked if she could cosplay, and I said sure. She got very excited and said I was going to love her costume, so I'll admit I thought she was going to do something sexy for me. Well, not exactly. The day of the convention comes, and she showed up at my house cosplaying Dabi from MHA- specifically a look he has later in the manga. It's a long white coat over white pants, no shirt. Her entire chest was exposed and she'd obviously spent hours applying burn makeup; she has short hair that she dyes constantly, this time she bleached it white and dyed a few red streaks.  I wasn't expecting her to show up without a shirt. Her burn scar makeup only covered half her chest, so you could clearly see her mastectomy scar. It wasn't a verry attractive costume, especially since she'd gone all out with the scars and made them look raised and kind of realistic.  We went to the con, and while a lot of people came up to take photos with her, I noticed several others looking at her chest. That evening, she said I'd been quiet all day, and I honestly told her I was a little embarrassed that she was flaunting her mastectomy scar like that. She got mad and said she was making the best of her situation and said I was being insensitive, and she's been distant ever since. I'm starting to feel guilty. AITA?",

For context, I have a 10 yo son Billy from my previous relationship and my ex isn't in the picture. I have to admit that Philip's relationship with my family isn't so great. They would disagree on a lot of things. For example, he had an argument with my dad when he said that he was keeping their grandson away from them but Philip stated he wasn't and that he couldn't visit with Billy because he had work (I was sick at the time). The latest argument was what made things worse. My mom and sister were discussing natural remedies (they're into this stuff) for my niece and Philip (he's a pediatrician) called both of them ignorant for not using meds instead which caused a huge argument and Philip being no longer welcome at my parents house. Now they'd sent me and Billy an invitation for Christmas but did not include Philip which, I expected given how strained their relationship has become. I called my mom to confirm that I'll attend but the minute Philip found out, he went off saying he could not believe I was fine with my family excluding him and then agree to go and leave him behind. I told him it's their celebration and I don't get to decide their guestlist for them. And also, I'm not leaving him behind because we did not have any plans for Christmas. He said he thought that we'd automatically celebrate together the 3 of us but now I'm taking Billy away from him as well. I thought that was a bit melodramatic because it's literally just few hours at my parents home but he insisted it was about principle and respect. We had a big argument and I said that he basically alienated himself by continually picking arguments with my family, but he started ranting saying it wasn't about the fact that they didn't invite him, but the fact that I was willing to let him spend Christmas alone without me and Billy. We went back and forth on the issue but do not seem to reach a solution. My parents are used to spending every major holiday with Billy.

I pointed out to her after splitting the gift card it would be way less then she spent on the costume and it was only a few hours but she didn\u2019t want to listen to reason.  Now a month later and she is still moody and mostly ignoring me. My ex husband told me I made her miss out and she works so much she missed out on a lot of stuff with her friends and I could have let her have this. But at the end of the day I saved her 80$. I just trying to teach my daughter how to be responsible with money she could have gotten a cheap costume especially since I she would have only worn it for a few hours.",

        "selftext": "Last week, I was using my sister Ashley\u2019s phone because mine was dead and I needed to call a friend to confirm plans. Dialing my friend\u2019s number, I saw a tinder notification of some dude messaging her. Immediately, I asked why she\u2019s on tinder (she\u2019s 17) and she grabbed her phone back and said \u201cnone of your business\u201d  I decided that I wanted to have a little fun with this. I wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt (maybe she\u2019s just swiping for fun?) so I didn\u2019t want to go straight to ratting her to our parents. To test if she was just using for fun, I decided I was going to make a tinder profile (of someone else) and message her and see if she responds. I asked a good friend from back in college (who happens to be a male model) Kevin if he\u2019d mind if I used his pictures and explained the situation. He thought it would be hilarious and told me to go for it.  I created the account, set my age to 22, set my swipe radius to a mile, and quickly found my sister\u2019s account. Her age was set to 19 (lie, she\u2019s still in **high school**) so I was definitely more suspicious of her now. I superliked and less than an hour later, she matched AND messaged me.  I decided to set up a date to a fancy restaurant downtown for Sunday afternoon and told her we could \u201chead to my place afterwards\u201d. She was completely receptive and said she\u2019d meet me there. She told our parents she was hanging out with one of her track friends and spending the night at her place.  After she left, I told our parents EVERYTHING and showed them all of the messages. They were pissed, and I suggested we all go to the restaurant. My dad and I just went instead and saw her sitting at a table alone all dolled up waiting for \u201cJim\u201d. My dad went up to her and said \u201cJim\u2019s not coming\u201d and she screamed and asked what we were doing there. I told her that there was no Jim and that it was fucking stupid of her to be trying to meet grown men on tinder at her age. My dad harped on to that and lectured her on lying and meeting strange men on the Internet, and being so willing to go back to a *stranger\u2019s* place. We were a bit loud so people were starting to look at us and my sister eventually bursted into tears and ran out.  I told my friends in a groupchat the situation and they all agreed it was hysterical, except 2 of my female friends who said I was a \u201cfucking dick\u201d and \u201ccruel\u201d to her. My other friends defended me and said she needed to be taught a lesson. Wondering who\u2019s right and if I went too far? EDIT: Yes, when I asked if she wants to go to my place afterwards, it was heavily implied that she would\u2019ve had sex with Jim. That\u2019s why I went the extent that I did. Alright after reading all these judgments, I came to the conclusion that I\u2019m TA. But I\u2019m TA she needed. If anything, she knows not to be a complete moron when finding people to hook-up with on tinder.  And to the people who said she\u2019ll never speak to me again, we just finished playing fifa for the last hour so \u00af_(\u30c4)_/\u00af",

        "selftext": "Hey I'm 29 my husband is 34. We have an 5 month old daughter. I have decided I want to become a veggie mainly for enviromental reasons. I've been considering doing this for some time as I think meat production has a hugely negative effect. Having our daughter has made me a bit more eco conscious as I am afraid of the world she'll live in in the future. I've been trying to reduce the meat in my diet for some time. My husband doesn't want to do this and complains every time I cook a meatless meal. I am a SAHM at and cook almost all of our meals. I've told him I don't want to cook meat anymore and that if he wants to eat meat then he can cook it himself and that he is lucky I am cooking for him everyday whatever I cook. However he says that I should also at least cook meat and add this to the meal for him. He says I can't force him to change his diet and eat less meat but I say that I'm not as he can still cook him meat. He says it is unfair on him to force this major lifestyle change on him. And he thinks I am being hypocritical and petty not cooking meat anymore when I've eaten it all my life. He thinks it is silly me not cooking meat for him if he is going to do it later, as I am just saving him from cooking meat and the amount of meat cooked will be the same so he thinks the only result in this is me not doing something nice for him. But I think doing that would be a massive inconvenience for me and also it defeats the purpose of me becoming veggie in the first place. I do kinda understand his point of view. He also is unhappy that I plan to cook veggie meals for our daughter and thinks it is unfair to force her into being a vegetarian but again i don't think I am as I don't plan on stopping her eating meat in school etc. Just wondering what y'all think about this?",

        "selftext": "My lovely girlfriend and I have been together for 8 months. She slept over at my place last night, and in the morning she woke me up saying she had went out and brought back a couple of lattes and pastries from a coffee shop around the corner from my apartment for breakfast. My issue with this is that my apartment has a two factor entry, first my student ID to scan in and then my key to get back into the apartment (it auto locks). I asked her how she was able to get back into the apartment and she said that she grabbed my keychain (which has my ID on it in a wallet type thing) before heading out to buy us breakfast so she would be able to get back in. I told her that I didn\u2019t appreciate her violating my privacy like that, and she got upset, saying that she was just trying to do something nice for me. We started to fight about it and I ended up asking her to leave. Since then, she hasn\u2019t answered any of my texts or calls. When I told my roommate about this he said that I was the asshole because she did something thoughtful for me and I yelled at her about it. I think she was violating my privacy by stealing my keys. AITA? Edit: I thought it was weird that she took my keys without asking, they could have gotten stolen or something while she was out, I get that she was being nice but why couldn\u2019t she have asked?? Edit 2: and no she still hasn\u2019t responded to me Edit: I\u2019m at work now obsessing but I know that I screwed up. I had a bad experience with privacy in my last relationship and i guess I\u2019m projecting or something. And no, my girlfriend hasn\u2019t responded to any of my voicemails or texts besides sending back money I tried to send her for the breakfast last night but she might not be awake yet, it\u2019s early in my time zone Final edit because people keep messaging me: long story short, she texted me and we met for coffee earlier this afternoon. I brought her flowers and apologized for being insane. We had a long talk about my privacy issues from my last relationship.  She chose not to break up with me, she will be getting lots of dates and back rubs in the future. Also, I am already in therapy but thanks for suggesting it",

        "selftext": "Okay just writing the title like that made me feel super guilty, but please hear me out before judging too harshly. I (38 F) have 4 kids ages 11 months, 3, 5, and 10. I love them all more than anything, but I\u2019ll be the first to admit that our house is constant chaos and it can get very exhausting. My sister (33F) is child free, but loves my kids and was happy to watch the older 2 or sometimes 3 to help me keep my sanity. This has been extremely helpful and I tell her all the time how grateful we are for her help. The thing is that the kids used to go over to her house, but right now they couldn\u2019t because my sister was fostering an elderly chihuahua. My sister claims she couldn\u2019t have them over for the time being because they would stress out the dog. Her dog was extremely frail and timid so I think this was a fair assessment. This was the 4th dog she has fostered, all of which couldn\u2019t be around my kids. This most recent dog took 8 months to find a home for, but most of her other dogs took even longer. When she told me she found an adopter I knew I could finally breathe a sigh of relief and joked about how I was so glad she could babysit again. My sister proceeded to tell me that there was a second dog that desperately needed a new foster, so she planned to take in that one as soon as her current dog was gone. So, she couldn\u2019t do anymore babysitting than she already is (sometimes she comes over to my house in the morning to help out). I could literally feel my stress levels spike. I haven\u2019t ever done this before, but I opened up to her about how much I have been struggling since she got the dog. How little sleep I get each night, how my husband hasn\u2019t been helping as much as he should, and some other deeply personal issues that I\u2019ve been struggling with. Then I asked her, point blank, to not get another dog. She comforted me, but ultimately didn\u2019t agree on anything and said she needed some time to think. I know I am asking a lot of her since rescuing dogs is her passion and that is why I feel so guilty. But I don\u2019t have anyone else to help me. I can\u2019t afford a babysitter long term, and my friends all have their own kids to look after. Above all, my kids will always come before a dog and that\u2019s the reason I was willing to request it. I\u2019ve told a few different people about the situation and gotten a wide range of heavily biased opinions. So that\u2019s why I decided to come on here and as you guys. Was this unreasonable? I would never demand her to do this if she didn\u2019t want to, but is it really so wrong to just be honest my situation and earnestly ask? Edit: I am grateful for the honesty from people respectfully telling me that what I did was wrong. However I have also read a lot of horrible assumptions from people as well and I\u2019d like to clear them up. I am not some careless mother who just keeps \u201cpopping out children\u201d that I can\u2019t take care of. My husband is not a deadbeat dad. After our youngest was born he got severe depression. He isn\u2019t out having fun while I\u2019m working 24/7, he is miserable. I went to my sister instead of him for help because I don\u2019t want to lose him. I love my kids and I have always made every one of my decisions with what I believe are their best interests in mind. And no I don\u2019t think my sister is obligated to do anything for me, I was asking for help not demanding it. Edit 2: Insulting my husband doesn\u2019t help anyone. Yes he is in therapy and is on antidepressants. Anyone who has actually dealt with depression would know that that isn\u2019t an instant cure all. Still my husband does the very best he can. I asked my sister because I needed more help than he can provide right now.",

However, my wife is often exhausted so I let my mom come over to help out with cleaning and stuff (I can barely have time to work) and also, at the same time, Spend time with the baby and bond with him a little bit. Thing is my wife acts strange whenever she sees my mom with our son. She'd make a face and talk to her in a descending tone, even raises her voice at her causing mom to feel hurt. I asked my wife about it and she said it was because of what my mom is doing. I asked her to elaporate and she complained about mom holding the baby for long and taking forever to give him back to her. mom argued that my wife could ask nicely instead of outright yelling but my wife defended herself saying that she only starts raising her voice after she's already asked a couple of times and mom won't listen. They started arguing and mom started crying. that's when I felt enraged,  pulled my wife aside and told her to stop acting out and that if she keeps this up then we won't get anymore help from mom. She argued that she was trying to feed our son and that it was awful of me to think of it as acting out. I said I understood her frustration and yes mom can do things that require some patience from us. but a little kindness can go a long way in keeping the peace in this difficult time. She called me selfish and said that it's easy for me to say when I'm not the one dealing with this. from there the argument escalated despite me trying to cut it short. I went outside to calm down and after that my wife started cold shouldering me. I told her this was not okay but she told me to go sc*ew myself and that from now on out I should deal with taking our son back from my mom when it's time for feeding since I condone this behabior. I really am not condoning anything and really think she's stressed out yes but the way she behaves around mom is, in my opinion, not okay. ETM:: My goodness! I'm seeing so much anger here. I'm sorry I can not respond to you all but I just want people to calm down and understand that I in no way  agree with some of my mom's behaviors, just how my wife reacts is......not okay and that's all. really. thank you very much though!

        "selftext": "So right now both of my kids (16 year old son and 9 year old daughter) and my ex are extremely mad at me because I won't give up my appointed time with them. My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time.   A little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't switch days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged.   Well, last week my ex contacted me and told me the good news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to think of them. I told him tough luck and hung up on him.  Well, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying ask them in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was not letting daddy take them to Disneyland. Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.  I'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being can't tell them the truth cause they already know it.   I'm so pissed right now. Am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during MY time with MY kids? How is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? ",

We are a healthful household and we teach moderation and controlling how much we take when we have treats. We are also very active and every day strive to get the boys moving. However, Gwen is only here two weekends a month, and her mother has the exact opposite attitude. In all honesty that woman's blood type is probably ketchup. Similarly, Gwen is about 20lb heavier than a 5 year old girl is supposed to be. It makes me sad for this child and her health so when we get her I try to teach Gwen about healthy eating and moving around. We have the boys play with her so she's getting active, and we make a distinction between foods that are healthy and ones that aren't. When I see one of the kids reaching for a treat food in the pantry I'll ask would you like to make a healthier choice? And Gwen is really getting it, she's always going for better choices now and is also asking for fruit at home which is really good. Gwen's birthday ended up falling on one of her weekends with us, and while we were talking about what kind of cake to have, I asked Gwen about the healthier choice. My reasoning is unfortunately she's still getting all that garbage at home, and it's just not good for a growing girl. She agreed and we decided to have some low fat ice cream so she can still have a sweet treat. It's a brand Gwen loves and asks for every time she's here, so she was happy with it. Until the next day after she went back to mom. Her mom called us furious, she said then when Gwen got home and she asked about her birthday with us and her cake, Gwen started crying because she really did want cake but didn't want to make a bad choice. She accused me of fat shaming her and her daughter and that I owe her a cake and a big apology. I'm just looking out for the health of a child in my care, but I never said Gwen couldn't have cake and she could have had one if she said she wanted one. I suggested sticking to ice cream because I care. But did I go about it in a TA way?",

        "selftext": "I (21f) usually always sit with the same group of people in my university\u2019s dining area. There\u2019s this girl who i\u2019ve talked to a few times, but i\u2019m not really friends with. She\u2019s kind of quiet, but when she finally talks she seems normal. I\u2019ve sat across from her a few times and noticed how she was eating because it was weird to me. She eats maybe half of her food (keep in mind you control the amount of food. it\u2019s cooked by the cafeteria staff buffet-style. she could easily take less) and kind of plays with it with her fork when she\u2019s \u201cdone\u201d (aka eating half of it, sometimes even less).  I didn\u2019t say anything for a while, but a few weeks ago I had to ask her why she always only ate half her food. She seemed a  embarrassed, but answered she thought she was more hungry and laughed it off. I then asked her why she made this mistake every time we ate, and that she must have learned by now. She didn\u2019t really answer (I don\u2019t actually remember, but it wasn\u2019t actually an explanation) and left pretty quickly. She doesn\u2019t really show up that much anymore, but when she does she still eats like this, and I couldn\u2019t hold it in anymore. I asked her once again, and also asked her if her parents never told her not to play with her food.  It was a genuine question, some people are raised in households where manners aren\u2019t important, but obviously they are for most people. She got really mad at me and told me to stop commenting on her eating habits and that it was none of my business. I told her that it absolutely was since she was sitting at our table and obviously wasting food. She told me to go fuck myself and left and threw out the rest of her food (AGAIN!) After she left, one of my friends told me to leave her alone as she seemed like she was having a hard time and maybe had some sort of issue with food. Yeah, obviously she has an issue with food?? She keeps wasting it! She hasn\u2019t shown up again, i\u2019m assuming she buys her own food now, which might teach her not to waste it so that\u2019s good. The same friend who told me to leave her alone keeps pestering me to apologise to her, but I think she should apologise to me. She\u2019s unnecessarily rude when being asked the most basic and obvious questions and also told me to go fuck myself? That\u2019s way more harsh than anything i\u2019ve ever told her. Keep in mind that I care a lot about food waste and the environment.AITA for telling a girl to stop wasting food? EDIT: OK! I\u2019m the asshole! Sorry i\u2019m not studying to be an eating disorder specialist. I looked up stuff about it and i\u2019m realising I was too harsh. I\u2019ll apologise the next time I see her and try not to be so condescending. But you should all follow your own advice. If people genuinely don\u2019t know something you should tell them nicely instead, and i realise i should\u2019ve tried to educate her NICELY about food waste and not have commented at all on how she was eating",

        "selftext": "I F30 have been with my fiance Ned M36 for a year and a half. He has a 5yo son with his ex girlfriend. They don't have a custody arrangement but he has him most of the week because the mom is currently sick. His son is lovely but I noticed that Ned takes him everywhere he goes, including places that aren't child friendly and we have an issue with that now but we're working on it.  His son's 5th birthday was days ago, Ned took us out to a restaurant to celebrate. The place was nice and looked a bit unfitting for the occasion because it was a somewhat expensive place. Anyways, We ordered food then got the birthday cake which was a surprise to me because I thought we were going to celebrate at home...so we could be free to sing and play however we wanted. I still had no issue with that til Ned started singing the happy birthday song to his son. I was stunned I almost drop my plate. He was singing it at the top of his lungs not even looking around or paying attention to how many people staring at us awkwardly. I felt so embarrassed I kept whispering for him to stop but he ignored me. Of course my future stepson was hyped and a little too active which isn't good when we're at a public place. I expected the staff, the manager, anyone to get involved and stop him but no one did. In fact some woman came up to us and offered that she help him take a video recording. I wasn't in it at all. I froze in my seat looking stunned and a little angry. He looked at me later asking what was wrong. I didn't say anything except thanks for finally noticing! he didn't understand what I meant and I didn't explain til we were in the car. I flatout told him that he embarrassed me the second he started singing in the restaurant. He looked shocked saying he didn't get why I would be embarrassed by him celebrating his son's birthday and cheering him up. I told him we could've done this at home when we'd be more comfortable and free. He took it as in I was ashamed of him and his son but I denied it and said that it just felt awkward and embarrassing to maybe because I've never been in this situation and also judging from the restaurant we were at. He said that his son's mom is sick and he's trying to do all he can to cheer him up and that all families do that and no one had an issue with that except me then when I tried to explain, he got mad and said he no longer felt like talking. We haven't been speaking since then. It appears he's still salty about me saying what I said and insiating that I see him and his son as an embarrassement. AITA? I think he's being too harsh with the whole ignoring me thing instead of talking it out.",

        "selftext": "I (35F) am a single mother to 2 kids (5 & 3).  Both my kids are in daycare and over the years I have built a solid friend group with a handful of other moms and our kids regularly get together for play dates.  The father of my kids is not in the picture at all and my relationship with him is non-existent.  This is 100% for the best and I am currently in therapy to deal with a lot of things that my ex did to me.  This friend group has literally been a lifesaver for me at times.   A few months ago, there were 2 new kids that started at our daycare center.  They are similar in age to my kids and were placed in the same classes as them.  I noticed that their dad was the only parent to ever pick up or drop off the kids.  He would try to make small talk with me a few times, but I am uncomfortable around strange men so I would be polite, but not engage further than that.   Our mom group has a group chat that we use to support each other and arrange play dates.  A few weeks ago, one of the moms texted the group chat that she was adding this new dad to our group chat because he wanted to have his kids participate in play dates outside of daycare.   I privately texted that other mom and told her that I don't feel comfortable with a man I don't know having my contact information and told her that she should have consulted all of us before deciding on her own to add him to our group chat.  I then texted the rest of the moms and told them that I want them to keep a separate group chat without the other dad because I don't know him and it makes me uncomfortable.   This resulted in a lot of divided opinions with about half of the moms agreeing to a separate chat and the other half saying that would be too difficult to keep track of and that it is wrong to exclude another parent just because he's a man and that I'm being unreasonable.   The mom I texted privately replied to me that she has talked with this dad numerous times and that he seems like a nice person and good parent and that his kids shouldn't be excluded if they want to hang out with their friends outside of daycare.  She told me I am being difficult and making this all harder than it needs to be.   The other day when I picked up my kids, my 5-year-old was upset because a bunch of his friends were talking about a playdate that he wasn't invited to.  I texted the moms about it and they said that they were getting the kids together with the new dad and didn't invite my kids because of how I was acting.    I told them it was rude to exclude my kids like that and a couple of the moms told me to grow up because that's exactly what I was trying to do to this dad and his kids.   I'm at a loss because these moms have been so supportive to me in the past and as soon as this dad comes into the picture it's like they pulled a 180 and don't seem to care at all.  There are still other moms who agree with me, but now it's like our friend group has been divided by this.  ",

        "selftext": "My ex and I are split up.  Our older son lives with him and younger with me.  We are both not high income but he somehow landed a wife who makes 4x our income and they often go out of the country on nice vacations which I guess he has been sharing with the kids. The kids want their passports now thanks to his brainwashing. I initially said yes because him and my son caught me off guard and started asking me if it was okay one day.  Then I had time to think about it and realized how bad things are in the world right now and I don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s worth the risk and danger having the kids so far away from me and out of the country with their dad and stepmom.  They also need my consent per our custody agreement to go out of the country anyway, and at this point I\u2019d never say yes. So today when my ex asked me if X date was okay for the passport appointment I asked where he is even going to be taking the kids, to which he told me \u201che didn\u2019t know yet, they just want to get the ball rolling because it takes 3 months just to get the passport and they haven\u2019t planned anything specific yet\u201d which I find sketchy. So I told him and the kids no, that he needs my consent to take them anywhere because of how bad the world is right now and I\u2019d never agree so passports are pointless.  My younger son got upset and my ex got angry also and kept repeating \u201care you just never going to allow them to go anywhere then?\u201d I never said that, just not right now. So my ex is texting me now saying I\u2019m an asshole and I\u2019m \u201crobbing my kids of experiences\u201d except I never have gone out of the country and don\u2019t have a passport and I am fine, so I don\u2019t really buy it.  Like does a 7 year old and a 14 year old really need to experience japan or england or whatever, they can go when they are 18 and probably appreciate it more then. Other than some initial disappointment my kids haven\u2019t even mentioned it to me again so I have a feeling they don\u2019t really care and it\u2019s more their dad influencing them. So AITA?",

He refused to get them when he was a child/teen cause he feared people would make fun of him, but he finally accepted to get them after the dentists told him clearly that it wouldn't be recommended to replace his extracted teeth till he fixes his crooked ones. The issue is that our wedding was supposed to be coming up soon, but now I plan to postpone till my fiance gets rid f his braces. I have nothing against him wearing braces. I even encouraged him to get them to finally fix his bad teeth, but did you ever saw of a groom wearing braces at his wedding photos ? I don't think so. I thought my fiance would be understanding, but instead he got mad at me and accused me of being ashamed with him. That's obviously no true, I just want our wedding photos to be as esthetically pleasing as possible and that's why I want to postpone our wedding till his braces come off. I also told him he could've avoided all this if he got invisible braces, but he said these were much more expensive and wanted to save money specifically for our wedding and honey moon and didn't think his fiancee would be so shallow to care about it. He ended up saying that if I postpone the wedding now I might as well just call it off altogether, which I think is incredibly unfair of him to do, but maybe I should've insisted on this issue either.

        "selftext": " 2 weeks ago my son [Ethan, 27]and his wife [Jess, 30] bought a small one story house in the town we live in. After settling down they invited us for a small party for the occasion. We sat for dinner and talked about the house a bit. Me, my husband and Jess continued conversing after Ethan excused himself to take an important call. Jess showed me the original key to the house and I asked if she made copies yet and she said no. I said she should and also give one copy to me as well. She looked at me funny and asked why she should. I explained that it is necessary so that it could be used in emergencies. she rudely said I don't know what kind of an emergency that would require you having a key to our house, sure won't be a fire incident!. She obviously didn't seem to have any idea that a fire incident wasn't what I meant and I got offended by her sarcasm. I pointed out that it's not just her decision because this is my son's house as well. She smiled at me trying to be polite and stated that only the ones who contributed towards the house get a copy and that I really don't need one anyway. Also assured me that my son will have the same answer for me. Basically saying Don't bother bring this up with Ethan, he'll tell you the same thing but I did and she spoke on his behalf the entire argument repeating what she said over and over. Things escalated to her calling me pushy and me telling her she was being unnecessarily rude and disrespectful . My husband and I left in a rush and I felt horrible. My husband went on and on about how paranoid and controlling I was to basically be demanding a copy of the key to the new house but again I stated that I was just trying to be helpful and taking extra precautions since anything could happen but he insisted I overstepped and ruined Ethan's and Jess's joy for their new house as well as dinner. I genuienly do not think what I said was out of line and I'm not sure why Jess reacted so intensely. I think my request was innocent.",

My wife (F33) is a big nerd, which I normally appreciate, but she is taking things way too far today. She took today off of work, so she could be up at 4AM to play her online game at launch. I didn\u2019t wake up until about an hour ago (10:30, and she was still playing. I mentioned that I wasHungry, hoping we could make breakfast together , which we like to do together. She instead said that I should \u201corder us something from doordash, im in the middle of a dungeon and may be a while.\u201d I didn\u2019t really wanna get takeout, because we had already discussed ordering pizza tonight for dinner, and that\u2019s a lot of take out food in one day.

I said that it was unfair to our family for her to isolate all weekend, and she got even more mad, telling me that I have two hands and can feed the goddamn cat. I was in tears at this point, and I did raise my voice and said that I was worried she\u2019s obsessed with this game and maybe she needs professional help. She threw her car keys at me and said that I need to get out of her face, that she\u2019s works all the time and doesn\u2019t ask for much, and I need to leave her be and get out of her face for a few hours. I am truly concerned that she has become obsessed with this online game, and I\u2019m hoping that maybe reading this thread will wake her up to it, but I might\u2019ve been the AH too. Edit: some additional info I forgot: ir isn\u2019t just today, for the last few weeks she\u2019s been hyping herself up for this. When the game got delayed, she MOVED HER VACATION time rather than just keep her previous day off and spend it with me.

        "selftext": "Hi everybody (((: I (20F) and my fianc\u00e9 (24M) will get married next year in the summer and I'm very much looking forward to this. We have our issues, but then again, which couple doesn't, right? However, lately, he has been ridiculing my studies and the degree I'm getting. I'm studying in the Netherlands and he lives in Denmark, so we will close the distance next year after the wedding. I'm currently in my last year of the bachelor's degree in biomedical sciences. I would argue (but of course I'm biased) that this is a very intensive study and requires a lot of time and effort. Sometimes when I complain about this, he says that my degree doesn't matter and that I would be better off quitting anyway. The reason why he says this is because we would like to have a marriage with more traditional gender roles once we are married. So he will earn the money and I will become a SAHM. I don't have a problem with this, but I would like to have a degree to fall back on during tough times. Whenever I try to make this argument, he shuts it down immediately and claims that I would be better off just quitting my studies and becoming a housewife already, since once we are married I will never use my degree anyway. I would not mind working e.g. two times a week, but he is strongly opposed to this as he claims that it would interfere with my tasks and chores in our marriage.  He is currently still in carpentry school, which consists of him having several months of work followed by weeks of school, both of which he gets paid for. Not only does he dismiss the difficulty of my degree, but he also claims that the work he is doing is much harder. I can't disagree with him, because physically speaking it is definitely much more intensive, but I would like for him to acknowledge that my degree is also time-consuming and difficult.  Recently he made a joke about what a waste of time it was, me getting my degree when I should be in DK and making him dinner instead, since that would be more fulfilling for both him and me. I know I should not let these harmless jokes get under my skin, but I lashed out at him and told him he needed to stop ridiculing my academic achievements and dismissing all of it so easily, since it might come in handy at some point in the future. He then quite seriously told me (again) that I shouldn't take everything so personally and that he was speaking the truth, since I will not use my degree once we are married so it is a waste of time and money. Then somehow he spun it around and told me that I was not appreciative enough of him wanting to provide for me and our future family and that if I wanted to be a 'girlboss' I would be free to do so on my own.  So now I'm wondering if I did make a mistake by telling him to stop ridiculing my degree and if I somehow hurt him by appearing ungrateful. So, AITA?",

His best friend who was a mutual friend of ours until the divorce also texted me and said that he hoped I was happy with myself. I don\u2019t get how I could be an asshole but it obviously seems like he and his best friend has come to that conclusion, if I am the asshole yes I will apologize but firstly I need to know. Edit!My kids are fine and I of course would have taken them if no one else was available, I am not a monster. They are currently with his best friend as my ex is still in the hospital with his wife. So no, I would not him \u201crather\u201d leaving them with a stranger as many of you assume.",

We\u2019ve been saying we\u2019ll convert the laundry room into a bathroom for the twins for a while. It\u2019s an expensive project so we\u2019ve never gotten to it.  My husband and I started working on our garage recently and turned it into a gym for him, a new laundry room, and an office for me. Then we came into some money and decided to renovate both bathrooms, remodel the kitchen, and do work on the backyard.  The girls were pissed when we told them about the work we were doing on the house. They were saying it\u2019s not fair that my husband gets a gym when the twins share a room and that we chose to work on the backyard instead of adding the third bathroom.  They\u2019ve been calling us selfish and even got our parents and siblings to give us a hard time for not giving the girls another bathroom or giving the twins their own rooms. They don\u2019t understand that now that the laundry room is done we have the space for the bathroom. The bathroom is next on our list.  I wanted to get some outside opinions on this since our kids and our families have been giving us a hard time.",

We spent the day in an area that\u2019s known to have a lot of rich/famous people and towards the end of the day we saw one of my daughter\u2019s favorite celebrities (we\u2019ll call her A) walking out of a store.  My daughter ran to the store but when she got near A, she was stopped by A\u2019s security. They said that A\u2019s there with her daughter for her daughter\u2019s birthday and wants to focus on her daughter.  My daughter was very upset because she\u2019s been a fan of A for a very long time so she tried again for a picture but was turned away.  My daughter was crushed so later that night I made a post talking about my experience with A. How she wouldn\u2019t let anyone go near her and her daughter, the fact that her security was rude, and her not being willing to stop for a couple seconds for a picture. I understand it\u2019s her daughter\u2019s birthday but a 1 minute interaction with a fan isn\u2019t going to ruin her day and if it does, that girl needs to learn that the world doesn\u2019t revolve around her.  The post ended up getting a lot of attention and a lot of people actually said my daughter and I were being entitled for expecting A to interrupt her daughter\u2019s birthday for everyone that wants a picture.  My husband also saw the post and said he couldn\u2019t believe that I would bash her for trying to spend the day with her daughter. I\u2019m not trying to bash her for spending the day with her daughter but she wouldn\u2019t be where she is without her fans so I think she at least owes it to them to take a picture.

I am on the more fit side, I\u2019m pretty lean, have well defined muscles and probably around 15% body fat. I used to be about 40 pounds heavier and lost the weight pretty simply. My girlfriend always complains about her weight and her body. I tell her I find her sexy for so many reasons outside her body and it didn\u2019t matter to me whether she got bigger or smaller. Eventually she decided she wanted to lose weight, I offered to help and when I pointed out things she could be doing better she gets mad at me. She isn\u2019t losing weight currently and in fact says she is gaining a few extra pounds. I ask her what exactly she eats in a day, she says she eats healthy so she should lose weight. I question that and we have an argument. I tell her that if she wants to show me, let me just spend a day with her and see what she eats in a day. She said only if I don\u2019t make comments on what she\u2019s eating as she\u2019s eating it. I agreed. Now by the end of the day she had consumed, a plate of avocado toast that was about 400 calories, a coffee that was 110 calories, an 800 calorie salad from chick fil a and a fry (as a \u201creward\u201d for the salad) and veggie burrito that was about 500 calories. Along with snakinga but throughout the day. Her total consumption was about 2200 calories. At the end of the day I explained this to her. My exact words were that the amount of calories she is consuming is the amount I need to maintain my weight as a man 5 inches and 20 pounds bigger, who is constantly active. So chances are she\u2019ll slowly gain weight eating like that and that eating healthy isn\u2019t going to guarantee she\u2019ll lose weight. She got super fucking pissed at me and told me I wasn\u2019t helping her and was just shaming her. I told her I want to help her but she did not listen.  AITA ",

When I was a kid I always wanted a dog but my parents said no. I never got the chance to get one during my twenties but recently my interest in owning one was sparked again so I asked my family what they thought about getting a dog. My wife wasn\u2019t enthusiastic about it but she relented after a few weeks of me asking. Alex and Jake were excited to get one but Dylan was immediately opposed to the idea.  Dylan was always different than my other sons, he never had an interest in sports and was always more subdued than his brothers which has always made it hard for me to connect with him.  He remained opposed to the idea of getting a dog but me and my other sons managed to wear him down until he finally relented. However, he said that if we did get a dog, he wasn\u2019t going to be interacting with it or taking care of it, that would be completely on me and his brothers. I found this ridiculous but i agreed in the moment hoping he would change his mind after meeting the dog.  The problem is he hasn\u2019t changed his mind yet. We\u2019ve had Zeus for seven months now and Dylan has not warmed up to him in the slightest.  He doesn\u2019t play with the dog, he doesn\u2019t cuddle with him, he doesn\u2019t let Zeus into his room because he \u201cdestroys stuff\u201d and whenever he is near the dog he just ignores him. I find this completely ridiculous. Zeus loves Dylan, he follows him around whenever he sees him and jumps on him to get his attention and play but Dylan just isn\u2019t receptive to it. To change this, I told Dylan last week that he would be in charge of walking the dog every day after school. Dylan straight up refused and has shut down the conversation every time I bring it up. It\u2019s been a week and he hasn\u2019t walked the dog once.  In my frustration, I told him that if he didn\u2019t start listening then I wouldn\u2019t allow him to go to the comic book store anymore and he freaked and told my wife. Now, my wife is upset with me, claiming that I knew what I was getting into with this and I knew that Dylan wouldn\u2019t be playing with the dog but his intolerance of the dog is weird and I refuse to entertain it any longer.  My wife has been short with me ever since that conversation and Dylan is cold with me as well. Alex is now agreeing with his mother which is making me have second thoughts. So Reddit, AITA?",

On the car ride back, Will was pretty quiet. I ask if he\u2019s fine and all he says in a sarcastic tone is, \u201cPeachy.\u201d I ask him if I did anything to upset him and he responds back with, \u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m educated enough to properly explain myself.\u201d I tell him I didn\u2019t tell my friends that he was unintelligent, just that he wasn\u2019t college educated. He accused me of minimizing how hard his Navy schooling was, but I explained that military education and college education are simply not the same. We continued to fight until we got home.

Even my parents started calling and there was a huge fuss which frankly, was unnecessary if my brother just left in silence or made up some excuse. I contacted him later and expressed my grief and frustration with what he did. I told him how the news of his wife being in labor disrupted the wedding and caused my wife to feel like her day was ruined. He lashed out asking how any of that was his fault. I explained how he should've just left or made up some excuse to leave but he said he didn't mean any harm and that he was in a hurry and worried at the time. He said it wasn't like he announced it and told me I disrespected him by arguing with him about it. We had a big argument and our parents sided with him and told me to 'get over myself' and are now expecting me to apologize. Edit// I just came back and started reading the comments.

The past few months, my house has turned into a hangout spot among my friends. My best friend Tyler is dating Gwen. Gwen has a friend named Julie. We\u2019ve all known each other since freshman year of college. I\u2019ve always had a crush on Julie and we\u2019ve always been part of the same group. One night a few weeks ago I decided to just go for it and texted her to ask her out. She told me that she liked me as a friend. I told her I totally understood and thought that would be the end of it.  Well the next pool day came. I typically send out giant group text to invite everyone. I decided to not invite Julie this time. But she showed up. Not even with Tyler or Jenn. She came with some of the other friends in our group. And it was just really awkward. She tried talking to me the WHOLE time. I\u2019d say something quickly and try to leave. She partnered with me for every drinking game. We have never spoken that much even before I asked her out. After she left that night I told Tyler/Gwen what happened. Gwen told me she already knew. I told them that I didn\u2019t really want her around anymore. Gwen said she would talk to Julie about it. Well this past Saturday I had another pool day. Similar thing, sent out the text, left Julie off of it. I invited a girl that I\u2019ve been talking to. Well Julie shows up again. But this time she spends the whole day talking to the new girl I brought. They became \u201cbesties\u201d. Julie even told the girl that I asked her out before. It was just incredibly awkward for me.  So this Sunday I texted Julie individually and told her that I didn\u2019t want her around anymore. And that she shouldn\u2019t come to the next get together as I felt uncomfortable. She didn\u2019t respond. But now people in the friend group are calling me an AH.

And what I really appreciate about this counselor is that she takes our situation into account as well and is willing to speak up for my husband and I. A few years ago, when our daughter wanted us to attend a gay parade with her, we were hesitant and our counselor stood by us by telling our daughter that it was too soon. But other than the gay parade, things have been pretty smooth up until now. My husband has drawn a hard line about attending the wedding. I was sort of on the fence about attending, but I decided to stick with my husband. Our daughter is pissed. At our last therapy session together, a week ago, our daughter said that if we didnt come to the wedding, all the work and progress that we had made would mean nothing to her, and that she would not want us to be a part of her life. Again the counselor spoke up for us and told our daughter that everyone had their hard boundaries (boundaries that they would absolutely not cross) and that instead of making ultimatums, it would be better to consider the overall picture rather than letting one moment be the deciding factor of the relationship. [I'm paraphrasing, she said it much better, but I think I got the main point]. The counselor talked to me privately afterward and told me how her parents hadn't came to her wedding, and they eventually made up thirty years down the line, but that was thirty years of memories that they both had missed out on. Yet, when she talked to her parents about it recently, they said that even as much as it had hurt them not to go, they would have made the same choice because it was just something that they strongly disapproved of. She ended by telling me that she wasn't going to tell me to go or not to go, but to really consider all the pros and cons.",

        "selftext": "I had a major fight with my wife a few hours ago and I strongly think I\u2019m in the right but she is so angry I almost feel like I\u2019m the one crazy. I\u2019ll provide context. I married my wife 3 years ago but we have been together 6. One important thing to note is she\u2019s extremely clean. I regret not moving in together until we married because while I knew she was clean I didn\u2019t know the full extent. Let this be a lesson to live with your partner before marriage. She is the reason why our house looks like a model home. She hates dishes in the sink while I\u2019m content to let them sit for a couple days. She spends her off days scrubbing bathrooms because in her mind they should be cleaned weekly. She doesn\u2019t let me bring my shoes inside and insists I shower immediately when I get home before laying in bed. There are a million more things but hopefully you have an idea.  This didn\u2019t start hurting our marriage until we had kids. We have a 2 year old and a 1 year old. I\u2019m a SAHD. I left work when our youngest was born and that is when our disagreement on how clean the home needs to be started to get bad. She expects me to do most of the chores now when it used to be primarily her and I wouldn\u2019t mind if they were reasonable. She wants the children to have a bath everyday and I think every 1-3 days is fine. She wants all of their toys put away by the end of the day and I think there is no point when it will be a mess again. She wants the dishes done daily. She wants all house bedding washed weekly. She wants me to vacuum weekly. She wants me to mop every 3-4 days since in her logic the kids spend a lot of time playing on the floor. They will not be hurt or sick if I mop every 2 weeks. Because I don\u2019t play along with most of her demands she ends up being the one to do most of the housework when she gets home or her rare off days. She works 40-80 hours/week so it is a lot but she does it to herself. I feel I do what is reasonable. This all built up to today. She got home and saw I hadn\u2019t yet washed the dishes and there was still grease/food in some of the pans and on the countertop. Also I hadn\u2019t yet brought in the trash cans from the previous two days when they were emptied. She flew off the handle calling me lazy and a slob. She said she would like for me to return to work since in her eyes I\u2019m doing a poor job and use the money to hire a weekly housekeeper and a nanny who \u201cwouldn\u2019t leave the kids in pjs all day.\u201d I got pissed and told her she is crazy and she works herself up over small things and I will not be leaving my kids with a stranger. She packed a bag for herself and our babies and to her mom\u2019s house. I\u2019m furious. Am I the asshole? Edit: so I\u2019m the asshole. The common belief is I need to help more around the house. I\u2019ll see what I can do and apologize to my wife. Thanks.",

        "selftext": "I (30f) am a teacher. I have a class with 24 students. I teach 1st grade.  I told my students that we could have a barbecue at a park (with hotdogs and hamburgers and snacks) for whoever filled their \u201cgood noodle\u201d sticker charts. This has been approved by the principal and I teach at a private school.  We have daily sticker charts to track their behavior in school. They had to have perfect behavior all of April in order to participate.  I have one student who has some behavioral issues. They did not earn all of their good noodle stickers this month. Since this student - we\u2019ll call Bobby - didn\u2019t earn the barbecue I had let his mother know just in case he mentioned it.  Bobby would join another class for the day and do work inside while his classmates were at the barbecue.  She has been sending emails complaining to myself and the principal all week about how her child should also be able to participate and it is unfair. She thinks we should make an exception since he has behavioral issues and feels we could be targeting him. I think I\u2019m being fair because he did not earn all of his good noodle stickers.  So AITA? Update:  I had a meeting today after school with the parents and the principal.  The principal agrees it would not be fair to the other students to allow Bobby to participate. She expressed she understands the frustration but she needs to make it fair for all students and not just Bobby.  The father said he understood and thought it was a fair assessment if all the other students were able to complete the goal.  The mother argued Bobby\u2019s IEP. The principal then reminded her we follow his IEP as a courtesy but as a private school we legally do not have to follow it and she has a choice to come to this school but if she\u2019d like to unenroll Bobby then there was a waiting list of students they could contact to take his place.  Bobby will still be enrolled in the school and in my class if anyone is wondering. He will not be attending the barbecue. Update 2:  Bobby\u2019s mother came to the school yesterday to drop off Bobby\u2019s lunch he forgot at home. She arrived during the children\u2019s snack recess. All of the kids were playing freeze tag. A game where once you\u2019re tagged you have to freeze until someone unfreezes you. I was inside prepping art while the teachers aid was with them.  Bobby\u2019s mother came inside absolutely livid saying we were forcing her child to stand in one place and not let him move. We explained the game and she said then the students are cruel for not unfreezing him but unfreezing everyone else. She was making such a big scene and so loud the principal overheard (their office is down the hall).   His mother was removed from the school grounds and we had a meeting with his father in the afternoon. The principal let him know Bobby would need to be unenrolled due to his mothers behavior. He did try to get him to stay until at least the end of the year but ultimately understood. He was also told if Bobby\u2019s mother is on the school grounds again the police department will be called immediately.",

        "selftext": " I used to have a german shepard named Willy, but had to put him up for adoption because my future stepson is allergic to dogs so Willy had to be out of the house before my fiancee and her son moved in with me. Ngl, I did feel like I'd given up on Willy, I've had him since he was small but I did thorough digging to find him the perfect home and the perfect family. I'd met up with the family and they embraced him right away, they seemed nice and all and agreed to keep in contact so I could learn about how willy's doing. This took place in december, I got busy with the holidays then loads and loads of work and was only able to call the family to check on Willy last week. Anyways so while I was with them on the phone I heard a small girl yelling Rudy repeatedly, I asked who Rudy was and they casually said it was Willy but they gave him a new name. I was absolutely shocked I asked if they were being serious with me and they asked what's wrong. I absolutely lost it on them telling them that that dog already has a name that was given to him by his owner and they should respect that. Pluse all his legal papers are under the name Willy but I was surprised when they said they took care of that legally...like how... I told them they had no permission from to rename the dog point blank period. but they argued that willy is theirs now and I have no say, I told them they were dead wrong and demanded that they have some respect and stop confusing him and start calling him with his real name. They refused and we got into a huge fight on the phone and social media where they threatened to block me. I was so mad I took the argument to their place where they threatened to report me for harrasement. I decided to take few days to let things settle down then I'd visit them again but my fiancee thinks I'm overstepping and should let the family decide this stuff without harrassing them which was an expected thing to hear from her since my stepson is the reason I had to let of my dog in the first place. She got offended but I told her that siding with strangers mistreating my dog did not paint her in good light though I started thinking she might be right. So AITA?",

        "selftext": "This is literally really stupid but she's really upset about it. So my (48) daughter (23) has a blue tongue skink who she heavily adores. She jokingly refers to it as her daughter, I've found it weird but she says it's because it's the closest thing she'd have to a child and she feels a strong emotional bond similar to a child. She has decided to remain child free for multiple reasons and I have been very supportive of this decision. Well she recently took her Skink to the vet for a checkup and she was excited to find out her Skinks gender. Afterwards I got a text asking if I'd come to her gender reveal party she was having. She explained it was just a small get together with cake and food for her friends she hasn't seen in a while with the gender reveal being mostly a joke (and a way to make fun of real gender reveals). Well I didn't come. I didn't see a point. It's just a lizard and I'm a busy person. She later called me and expressed she was kind of sad I didn't come cuz it'd been a while since I'd seen her but she understood I was busy. I told her she couldn't actually expect me to come to a gender reveal for a lizard. She said that it wasn't a real gender reveal, that was more of a joke and it was really just a small gathering to catch up with everyone. I told her if that was the case she should've just called it a gathering because I'm not coming to a gender reveal unless it's for a real grand daughter. She got quiet for a minute and then turned my words around, claiming I wasn't supportive of her decision to be childfree. I told her she can't possibly expect me to treat a lizard as a grand daughter, she said she didn't expect me too but it was clear I didn't respect her bond with her lizard and her decision, and she just wanted to see me and my reason for coming was hurtful. I told her she was being ridiculous over a lizard, she claimed it wasn't over the lizard and it was a gathering and not even centered around the lizard, but I stick by to what I said. It's ridiculous to have a gender reveal for a lizard. She hung up and I got a message from her best friend about how I'm an asshole for treating her that way, but I don't think I'm the asshole for not wanting to go to a party for a lizard?   EDIT: In the time I was away I got many replies and it was a lot to read through. Let me clear a couple things up. 1. My issue is that she said the party was a gender reveal, if she had called it just a party I would have come. But calling it a gender reveal makes it sound like it's for the lizard, and I'm not going to that even if it is a joke. 2. I don't know why it matters but the Skink is a girl which is why I said I'm not coming to a gender reveal unless it's for a real grand daughter. 3. Even though I don't agree with my daughter for being childfree, I have been supportive and only shown mild frustration. The reasons she decided to be childfree is she claims she's asexual, she just doesn't want one, she has emotional baggage and feels unable to care for a real child, she fears pregnancy, and she has a carrier gene like me and doesn't want to go through what I did (I had 4 miscarriages and a highly defect child that died after 3 months due to the gene). Yes there has been slight tension between us because I think she just hasn't found the right man (she never dated growing up) and her other fears are unnecessarily exaggerated, but it's ultimately her decision and I don't resent her.4. We haven't seen each other in three months. I'm a single mother and we have always been close which is why she invited me with her friends, I just didn't want to go to a party with a lizard, and if it wasn't for the lizard she should've called it a party instead of a gender reveal.",

        "selftext": "I've been married to my 2nd Husband Mike for 4 years now. He's a jokester and loves to crack jokes all the time. He especially like to joke with my brother Ethan and his wife. Ethan used to be okay with it til he started complaining about Mike taking it too far with his jokes. Some context about Ethan. He and his wife couldn't have kids so they adopted a boy Joey 2 years ago. Mike has been making silly, lighthearted jokes that involving Joey's bio parents as a way to mess with Ethan and his wife. I already talked to Mike and I tell you that he's 100%means no harm and he was just trying to get them to react. So fast forward to NYE, my parents hosted a big celebratory dinner and Ethan and his wife came. While we were eating dinner, Mike decided to tell a knock-knock joke to Ethan. He said Knock knock.. Ethan laughed and said Who's there?. Mike replied Joey's bio parents then he bursted out laughing. Silence took over and Ethan's facial experssions changed. His wife called Mike an idiot to which Mike replied with Hey...Relax it was just a joke. An argument ensued and dinner was paused. My parents suddenly told Mik to leave which I thought was too harsh. I tried to speak to them and get them to calm down but mom insisted that Mike leave. We left and Mike was complaining the whole time about how they overreacted. I called mom later and she told me Mike was out of line with his hurtful jokes about this touchy topic and told me I was wrong for defending him and saying he was just joking. She said he ruined NY for the family but I told her it was her and dad who ruined NY celebration for escalating the situation and kicking him out. I told her he could talk to them but again they were the ones who ruined NY celebration. She called me delusional for this statement and hung up. We haven't talked to them for days. I tried contacting Ethan but no response.",

        "selftext": "I\u2019m 49m and I have 2 children, Jake (23) and Nikki (17). Their mother and I are divorced. I have full custody and she sends no support. Both of my kids are good kids and good students with good grades. Jake got into his dream school but didn\u2019t get any scholarships. His undergrad school is one of the best school in our part of the country and it\u2019s expensive. I didn\u2019t want him to take out loans and have to carry a debt so I\u2019m paying for his tuition and living expenses. The total cost is roughly $50,000 a year. He\u2019s following in our family tradition and pursuing a career in dentistry (I\u2019m not a dentist but we have about a dozen dentists and oral surgeons in our family). I will also be paying for his dentistry degree. While I know it will be costly, I view this as a good investment as he\u2019ll have a starting salary of about $120,000 as a dentist in our area. If he decides to become an oral surgeon, his starting salary will almost double that figure. Nikki is a senior in HS. Like her brother, she\u2019s a good student and will have a good chance of getting into her dream school but she has a low chance of getting any scholarships. Her dream school is also a very good one located in the middle of a very expensive city. Tuition and living expenses will be roughly $75,000 a year. The problem is that she\u2019s dreamt of being a teacher since she was little and have made it clear she will be an education major because she wants to be a middle school teacher. The other problem is that the salary for middle school teachers in our area is $48,000-$60,000 in our area. I fully realize that she can move and work elsewhere but I can\u2019t imagine there are many middle school teacher in the US making 6 figures. I don\u2019t view paying $300,000+ for a career that tops out at $60,000 as a wise investment. I told my daughter that the state school that\u2019s 2 hours away have a good education program and her instate tuition and living expenses will only be about $20,000 a year. I view paying $80,000 for a teaching degree as a much better investment.  I\u2019ve tried discussing the matter with Nikki but she gets distraught every time I\u2019ve brought it up. She cries and accuses me of favoring Jake and being a sexist which is not true. I told her if she picks a major with a $100,000 starting salary, I\u2019ll gladly pay for her to go to her dream school but there\u2019s no way I\u2019m paying $300,000 for her to be a teacher. Now she\u2019s got family members involved. Some are staying out of it, some agree with me, and some are telling me not to play favorites.  I feel terrible so I\u2019m beginning to doubt myself. Am I wrong? Edit to answer a recurring question: I thought I made it clear but apparently I didn\u2019t. I\u2019m not limiting Nikki\u2019s education to $20,000 a year. I told her that\u2019s the max I\u2019m willing to pay for her education degree. I\u2019m more than happy to pay $75,000 a year if she picks another degree that will have a better return. For a while she thought about being a doctor and fell in love with England (we have family there) so I even offered to pay for her to go to Oxford which will be double the cost of her brother\u2019s tuition. But she\u2019s adamant about being a middle school teacher and I\u2019m unwilling to spend $300,000 that I worked hard for on an education degree. Edit to add: Oxford is hard to get into, I know that she won\u2019t be able to just walk in. I meant for her to apply and if she got in, I\u2019m willing to pay the cost of that school and the expense of living in an expensive country if her degree earning potential warrants that cost. Edit to answer a recurring question #2: Why did I bring up the family tradition? Am I an elitist? Why does it matter? I brought it up because getting into dental schools and graduating is tough. The reason why we have so many in our family is because we help each other out. The dentists and oral surgeons in the family happily tutor and give valuable internship experiences that would otherwise not be available. People who pursued the dental career in our family have never failed because we don\u2019t allow them to fail. Last semester my brother spent weeks tutoring our niece to prepare her for her state board exam and she passed in one try.",

He\u2019s at a curious age and is discovering the world, and I refuse to try and limit him and shut him down for not having the emotional sensitivity of an adult. Politely, I told that mother that I was sorry her daughter was struggling with insecurities, and I found some online parenting articles about building your child\u2019s confidence to send to her so she could use some tips to help her daughter out. She replied and said I was acting completely shamelessly and disgracefully, and I am not able to text her anymore. AITA?",

        "selftext": "My (16, M) family has a pet parrot. They are all pretty much obsessed with him and my younger and older sisters both keep buying him toys, new food, making him new fruit and vegetable mixes to try out etc. My parents also pay a lot of attention to him and even set up the extra room we have for his cage so he can sleep better at night. He has been with us for a few months now and my family's obsession still hasn't died down. I've been mostly indifferent since I'm not the biggest fan of animals and my parents keep him away from my room. Luckily for me it seems like he doesn't like me anyways so it's even easier to avoid him flying to my shoulder or anything like that.  The problem though is that today my sister Emma (10,F) was talking quietly to that bird. She was holding him and saying things like You know I love you right? and kissing him on the head while the parrot would just mimic the sound. It went on for a while and she repeated that enough that it seemed like she was looking for a response so I told her You know he doesn't understand you right.  After I said that she just looked at me and made a sour face and ignored me. I didn't want her to actually believe this bird can understand what she is saying since she watches a lot of Disney movies so I feel like they could have given her the wrong idea. I gently explained to her that it's just a bird and that he doesn't understand things like we do. She told me to stop bothering her and ended up leaving the room and told my mom about it. My mom told me she believed it was harmless for my sister to talk to her pet and that the bird reciprocated her feelings. So I told her that this will harm my sister's way of thinking and get her bullied at school. She told me to drop it and not get involved anymore. AITA? I think my sister is old enough to understand what I'm saying and my mom is just too nice.",

        "selftext": "I run a TNR program for feral cats. Non profit, I catch all cats and get them the medical attention they need myself, out of my own pocket. I love helping them. A lot of the cats are not able to be rehomed, so I fix them and release them. Get them their shots and hope for the best. I am not a large scale operation. Recently I was called to an area overrun with orange cats. They were everywhere and I mostly ended up handing it over to professionals. I did, however, manage to grab three very sweet cats. Two were terrified, skinny, a little beaten up, but overrall friendly. The third one was a little gent.  He was tubby, well groomed, fish patterned collar, the works. My plan was to find his parents and drop him off with a warning to keep him in due to the large amount of traps being set. Then the little bastard sprayed the inside of my car to the freakin max. So, apparently, he wasn't fixed. I couldn't really tell (longhair) and assumed he was so left my covers off. Big mistake! I debated taking him home or taking him to get neutered with the rest. He was an indoor-outdoor cat (indicated by his collar tag) and with so many strays I'm certain some were carrying his genetics. Ultimately I took him with me and got him neutered. No chip so I called the number on his tag and informed them where their cat was and gave them time slots to pick him up or have him dropped off. The owners went ballistic. They were cursing me out and came to collect their cat not twenty minutes later. Called me a kidnapper, blamed me for their child having nightmares (scared over their cat going missing). I tried to explain that he needed to be fixed if he was going to be outside but they didn't want to know. They said I should have called immediately regardless. I spoke to my rescue friend who said I was in the wrong. Even though we know we are technically in the right, we didn't have the legal ground to do that and it wasn't my decision to make.  I did apologise, but have blocked their numbers (the mom is flaming me on facebook and dm'ing people I know). I have a duty to care for stray cats. Me knowing an unneutered male was roaming free and not doing anything about it was a concern for said stray cats. Things are still tense between my rescue buddy and I and I don't completely disagree. I know I crossed a line even if it was for the greater good. People are finding out and taking sides, so I'm not sure who to really believe was right here. So... AITA?",

        "selftext": "So super weird situation and need a judgement. I (32M) have been engaged to Amanda (34F) for about a year, we dated for 3. She has a 12 year old daughter named Alexis. Me and Alexis have a good relationship. Me, Amanda and her ex all have a good relationship for the most part. I\u2019m totally comfortable with my role. So Amanda, her ex and Alexis have this weird thing they do. They all get together on Sundays and hangout the three of them. I guess it started as a family tradition and then once they divorced they kept it going. They make breakfast, watch movies and just hang around all day together. I find it really weird tbh. Like I\u2019m not insecure about it, but why you would want to spend a day a week with your ex is beyond me. I said how weird I found this when we started dating but Amanda said that Alexis looks forward to it weekly so she never stopped it. So at first I would just hang in our room or the basement all Sunday. But I got tired of being trapped in my own house so I started leaving the whole day. Amanda would never ask where I was going or anything. Wouldn\u2019t even notice I was gone.  So at first I was golfing or getting errands done. Or would find a bar. But then I reconnected with my old friend Bella. Bella and me dated 5 years ago and have remained good friends since. She just broke up with her husband and moved into a new apartment. I told her one Sunday that I was just planning on going to the movies and she instead invited me over. We smoked some weed, watched some movies, cooked and just hung out. It was nice and ever since it\u2019s become my weekly tradition. Whenever Sunday would come I\u2019d head over to Bella\u2019s and we\u2019d just hangout all day.  I didn\u2019t see the need to bring up to Amanda where I was going. She never asked or even wondered where I was every Sunday. So yesterday Bella stopped by our house to drop off my phone charger because I left it at her place. Amanda asked why Bella had my phone charger. And I told her that it\u2019s where I was on Sunday. She asked why I was there and I told her that was my Sunday hangout spot. She flipped out. Saying how rude it was to not let her know I was hanging out with an ex. I laughed and said \u201cdo you really not see the irony with that statement\u201d. She said it\u2019s different because she was forthcoming about her/ex\u2019s relationship and that if I had an issue with it then I should have said so. I said I did already bring it up and that she said it was important to her daughter. Was I supposed to interfere with the highlight of her daughters week in order to make myself feel better? No I\u2019ll just sneak out the back door and head to my friends house. And that I didn\u2019t see why this was even an issue at all. We trust each other and are adults. Amanda doesn\u2019t want me over there anymore and said she wants me to find another way to spend my Sundays. I said then I don\u2019t want your ex over here on Sundays anymore if that\u2019s how we\u2019re playing this. AITA? Update: some shit has already hit the fan with the whole situation. I\u2019ve put my foot down and said I\u2019m not being forced out of my house anymore. That they can do Sunday funday at her ex\u2019s place moving forward. I\u2019ll post a complete update when I can. I did want to clarify that the reason I don\u2019t hang out with them is that I was asked not to at first. Then I always felt awkward about the whole thing. So at first I stayed away because I was asked, then I felt like the fourth wheel so I decided to quit trying. Bella has really helped because she went through something similar with her SO.",

        "selftext": "My girlfriend (22F) and I (26M) have been together for almost 4 years and live together. She has a stable career and has bought herself a car and was taught to drive in high school.  I was never taught to drive, and it\u2019s not really necessary because I can uber, take the bus, or my girlfriend can drive. She\u2019s offered before to teach me to drive, but I decline because I\u2019m not really interested in learning because I don\u2019t plan on getting a car since they\u2019re a lot of money.  So, my birthday was yesterday and my girlfriend was really excited to give me my gift. It was private driving lessons, which admittedly cost her several hundred dollars. I was really offended because I don\u2019t want to learn to drive. She hyped the gift up like I\u2019d love it, but I honestly hate it. It seems more like it\u2019s for her because she wants me to learn to drive, than it is for me.  I got really upset and disappointed when I opened it and she kept pushing to ask why I didn\u2019t like it. I told her again that I don\u2019t care for driving and it seemed like a really impersonal gift, because I don\u2019t even want my license or a car so why would I want this? I felt like she doesn\u2019t even know me. And she got really upset so I suggested she return the lessons and get me something I would like better.  Now she\u2019s calling me an AH and said the lessons are non-refundable, and is really upset with me. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the AH because I\u2019ve told her before that I don\u2019t want to drive and I feel like she\u2019s trying to change me. So now she\u2019s being immature and won\u2019t drive me anywhere and tells me I can uber if I want to go somewhere, even if it\u2019s somewhere she was going to go already. Like she went thrifting and to the grocery store without me (we always go together) and said if I really wanted to go that badly, I can uber.  It\u2019s not even like I ask her for rides ever, I just tag along if she\u2019s already going somewhere. I get uber\u2019s to and from work and have a good job. So it\u2019s pointless for me to even get a car or license.  When I told her that she said that she\u2019s tired of always being the driver and likes to be the passenger sometimes, but to me it sounds like she gave me a gift that *she* wants. Because if she hates being the driver so much, I suggested that I could get lessons for *her* birthday, not mine, and that upset her even more. She said that isn\u2019t a gift for her and she\u2019d be upset if I got myself driving lessons for her birthday. I told her basically \u201csee, so you\u2019d be upset if I got you something that you think is for me for YOUR birthday\u201d and she said yes. So even though I explained to her there\u2019s a double standard, she\u2019s still insisting that I\u2019m the AH.",

        "selftext": "My SIL (married to my brother) is a resident physician who works 60-80hr weeks and frequently works 1 or both days of the weekend. Her residency is a 7hr drive from where me, my husband and my baby girl (1.5yr old). My brother and I were always very close growing up and even lived in the same apartment and later same city. We were never more than 20-30m away from each other. I got married and had my baby and he moved 7hrs away to be with his fiance, now wife, pretty soon after I had my baby. It was devastating for me as I had always pictured us being close and him really involved as an uncle. SIL works 6am-5:30pm 6-7 days a week but does have some golden weekends where she has Saturday and Sunday off. She usually has one per month and then she has 3 weeks of vacation (never over Christmas or New Years holidays). During those 1 weekend a month that she has completely off, her and my brother either stay at home because she needs to relax or will drive 2hrs to see her family. During the 3 weeks of vacation, which she is only able to take 1 week at a time, they went on a 1 week long trip to Hawaii, a 1 week long trip to Cancun with her family and then 1 week where they just visited her family 2 hrs away. They haven't made the trip to visit us more than 1-2x a year as they say the drive is too hard with the limited time off she has and she's usually too tired to come anyways. But not too tired for Hawaii or Cancun? They always ask my parents and us to visit them during holidays she works so at least we can be together and she will join everyday after 5. But, it's hard for us to travel with a 1.5 year old. My parents have to split time visiting there and visiting us and we need them for childcare. I've been asking my brother and SIL to visit us more even though I know her schedule is busy and my brother got frustrated with me. When I asked him to visit alone, he said she needs him because the heavy workload has been really mentally straining on her and quoted how resident physicians have a really high depression rate and basically called me TA. I feel its unfair we have to visit all the time considering we have a 1 year old  and also both work FULL TIME and feel they should balance better to visit us rather than just vacation.

        "selftext": "My sister(30F) just had her birthday and is obsessed with celebrating things now. She had her big birthday 4 day ski trip cancelled because of weather and is pissed because she had been planning it for a while. She made a big deal out of it because in her eyes she never got to celebrate anything. We went for a meal and karaoke but she didn\u2019t feel like it was enough of a celebration.  Tbh our family isn\u2019t big on celebrating anything but my sister kind of brought it on herself. My sister put a lot more pressure on herself when she was younger because everyone told her she was a genius. She skipped grades and graduated high school at 16. She didn\u2019t attend prom because she was younger than the other students so even though she was a senior she hung out with student her own age more so she didn\u2019t have friends to go with. Plus if I remember correctly she had AP exams afterwards so she spent that night studying because at that point she needed an A in every subject. She always says it was her biggest regret in life. Our parents didn\u2019t put that on her she was just over the top back then. I think it\u2019s overblown because she is very successful now in a job that\u2019s hard to get into so it\u2019s not like her hard work wasn\u2019t rewarded. Tons of people work hard without much to show for it which is worse.   She was complaining to me constantly about her 30th being ruined and said she only has her wedding to look forward to now (she isn\u2019t engaged yet but probably will be this year). I told her she shouldn\u2019t put so much on the wedding and it\u2019s just an expensive party which she can afford yes but it\u2019s still a lot to be putting on a single day. She said it\u2019s her last chance to celebrate something and all the achievements she had has been pushed aside to make room for the next thing and she wants her wedding to be memorable like her 30th was suppose to be but in a good way. She mentioned again skipping prom as an example and I told her that skipping prom to study is kind of a humble brag but more so it\u2019s not a big deal. I went to prom and honestly it wasn\u2019t that interesting, I get she missed it and it sucks but she has way better things in life rn. She got mad and said I got a lot more things celebrated than her so I don\u2019t understand what it\u2019s like to go back and realize there isn\u2019t even a single photo of the event. I\u2019ve texted her a few times since and she just replies with one word answers and I just wonder if she\u2019s overreacting or I\u2019m the asshole here. ",

        "selftext": "Last weekend, I had to fly out of town for my brother\u2019s funeral. He was a secret alcoholic and I hadn\u2019t seen him in 5 years. It was a rough trip. They had the idea that he would really like it if we went to an arcade bar and they kept buying drinks. I ended up having 5 voodoo rangers. The whole thing was weird. Because of the flight time and the location we ended up just staying the night at the airport. It was rough. Since I had no one else to help, I asked my best friend (let\u2019s call him Adam) and his girlfriend (let\u2019s call her Sue) to let my puppy out while I was gone.I was only supposed to be gone from Friday at 5 to Sunday at 3pm.  His parents (Mark and Lisa) also helped out. I called Adam and told him the instructions to take care of the pets, but I didn\u2019t leave a written list, which I now realize might have been a mistake. The original plan was for them to take him over to their house since he\u2019s about 3 months old. But Adam  didn\u2019t communicate that with his dad. And then the vet told us he had roundworm so that made it not possible for them because Mark  and Lisa\u2019s dog is old and they didn\u2019t want to risk it. When I got back, the first thing I noticed was that my puppy was in the wrong crate, he was covered in pee, and had chewed up the bed in that crate. So clearly, things weren\u2019t followed how I had asked. That already frustrated me on top of being hungover and exhausted and grieving. But I was too exhausted to deal with it at the time. My wife sent a thank-you text to Mark and Lisa but accidentally left out Adam and Sue. A little while later, Mark called me, asking about it and then straight-up asked if I was mad. The truth is, I was. because they didn\u2019t really do what I had asked. But instead of apologizing or acknowledging anything, Adam immediately shifted blame, saying it was my fault for not explaining things well enough, and got very pissed about me not saying thank you. Then Sue said I was being passive aggressive. Instead of saying something back I just told her that I\u2019d like to keep it between me and Adam because I originally asked him. I did shut her down but I didn\u2019t want her to get caught in the middle. That pissed her off royally though. Now, mutual friends are telling me I should smooth things over because Adam feels unappreciated and Sue feels disrespected. I do appreciate that they helped, but their reaction made me feel like they weren\u2019t being very understanding of what I had just gone through. AITA for not thanking them right away and for feeling put off by how they handled this? UPDATE: So I was going to Clarify on a couple things. 1. There was no neglect and that wasn't the point of the argument 2. I know I was frustrated over minor things. I would have never brought it up if it weren't for mark calling me and asking about it and pushed for an answer. 2. The reason my wife texted was because i was driving home and I fully intended on calling him personally to thank him and even joke around about my frustrations. I gave context in my post as to why I wanted to wait 3. I am appreciative of their help and I told them that when we were arguing, It did come off as not genuine. The whole thing got a lot bigger than I think needed to be and I didn't understand why. 4. I went ahead and talked to everyone and apologized for being frustrated and letting that overshadow my appreciation. Adam is still insisting that I should have just said thank you and bent the knee. The whole interaction I think is silly, but not worth being mad about. Puppies are a handful and he did a pretty good job all things considered.  5. Finally, some of y'all are out there. This was clearly a minor case of who the butthole is and coming at me saying I drank too much or that my wife carries the emotional burden is not needed. I definitely wasn't acting in the best way but I think a little grace is merited. I would really hesitate to wanna be friends with people who would kick you while your down. ",

        "selftext": "An internet mutual and I had the idea to apply to artist alley tables at conventions together, because it's easier to take care of a table with two people (if one has to pee, the other can babysit the artwork).  He has experience as a vendor at Cons and I do not. So I thought he could be my guide and help me navigate all that stuff. I also thought that our chances of actually getting a table would be better because he already had that experience.  We've applied at the end of last year and by now we have been rejected by every single convention we have applied to. With one exception. One convention didn't allow shared tables so we applied separately and then planned to ask the Con to put our tables next to each other if both of us got accepted.   Well, he got a rejection and I was accepted. It's by far the biggest Convention we applied to with the most competition for the tables. And it is his Dream Convention he always wanted to vend at.  The two of us had found 3 more Conventions we'd like to try for before I got that accepted to the big Con. But since I got that acceptance letter I am thinking that I might have better chances of getting in if I apply alone.  I knew from the get go that the products he made were of lower quality than mine but I thought his vending experience would be more important to Cons than the quality of his things (turns out, most Cons don't even ask if you have prior experience and just look at the products).  Why I would be the asshole: Breaking a promise is bad and he has talked multiple times about how he just isn't good enough and about how sad he is about all the rejections. I don't want to add insult to injury.  Why I wouldn't be the asshole: It turns out that his vending experience is limited to small Conventions. It seems like in most cases he was accepted, because all applicants were accepted. I didn't know about this before we decided to share a table. I don't think he intentionally mislead me but I would have made a different decision if I had known.   And for him art is a hobby, for me it's my job. The stakes are higher for me because my income depends on it.  Would I be the asshole if I break the promise I made to apply together and tell him that I want to apply alone?    ",

        "selftext": "My fianc\u00e9e (31F) and I (33M) have a daughter together (2F). My mom passed away in 2020, my dad lives on the other side of the country, and my fianc\u00e9e's parents both passed away in 2014. That leaves the only grandparent figures to my daughter that live nearby as my own grandparents (69F and 72M), who live about 15 minutes away. My grandma (step, but has been a grandma to me my whole life) has an incurable cancer, and my grandpa has dementia that is early on but progressing. Partly for these reasons, we would like our daughter to get as many memories with them as possible while they're still around and before my grandpa's memory loss becomes severe. There was one time we attempted an overnight stay with them while we were home by ourselves. It didn't go so well; she had a hard time going to sleep and was clear she has some separation anxiety. It wasn't all bad, but clearly something that needs to be worked on.  Ever since, my grandma, who between the two of them is usually the one we talk to and who makes decisions, has been quick to point out examples of her showing separation anxiety when around (which has become infrequent, the last time being on Christmas). When asking if they'd be willing to take her for a couple hours to get some time with her, whether just because or we have something to take care of, she refuses, saying she needs to get over separation anxiety before they can take her again. Our thoughts are that she won't get over it if we don't give her a chance to. And we don't exactly have a village of people able to help with that, as partly mentioned before. Meanwhile, my grandparents frequently watch the kids of my cousin (25F), the kids being 6F, 4M, 3M, and 2F. She is no longer with either of the two fathers and has been known to frequently dump her kids on our grandparents. My grandma has said multiple times after various incidents of disrespect that she will not help my cousin anymore, but ultimately winds up doing so anyway. When we bring up these issues, my grandma claims that because these kids are not well taken care of (sadly true), she needs to keep a closer eye on them; we take this as our daughter being punished for being well taken care of. She also believes they do not have separation anxiety because of the rocky relationship with their mom, so they are more willing to be at their house. She takes our pushing that we accuse her of playing favoritism with the other kids.  We realize that someone has to watch those kids so their mom can work. My situation is more fortunate in that regard as I work while my fianc\u00e9e is a stay at home mom. But we think there needs to somehow be more balance in the situation. And again, to have my daughter and grandparents to get plenty of time together before it's too late. So... AITA?",

He and his ex gf had a terrible and long relationship (10 years), in which she was cruel to me and my mother. They broke up, she threw him out, she took him back. We took him into out home to get him clean, and she came and picked him up. He got DUI\u2019s, we left him in jail to detox, she bailed him out. She refused to quit drinking and enabled his alcohol issues. She said they were in love, and other times she said he was a \u2018homeless guy\u2019 that lived with her.  My brother came to my house under hospice care, and given the animosity, I asked her not to come to my home. She did tell him goodbye at the hospital, and then screamed at me and my mother over his hospital bed because she blamed us for his issues. After my brother passed, my mother had him cremated and kept all of his remains. Immediately after he passed, I updated the ex and asked if he had any belongings at her house (he had family heirlooms, tools from my deceased grandfather, etc.) She told us she had thrown away his things and anything he had left was hers, since she had bought it.  Every other month, she sends me drunk messages demanding ashes and insulting me when I say no. She has never once expressed sympathy towards me or my mother.  I am done with the messages. I am thinking of getting a tiny urn and filling it with ashes from my cremated pets, and giving her that just to resolve the issue.

When I was given the opportunity to live rent-free in a family-owned apartment (as long as I found a roommate to pay a small rent), I chose Ava over a few other options because we were closest at the time. At first, things were fine, but now I feel suffocated. She constantly interrupts my study time, pushing me to play video games or chat despite my boundaries. I\u2019m an extrovert, but after long days at school, I crave alone time. When I retreat to my room, she knocks, saying she feels lonely and wants to sit on my floor, staring at me or talking about her day. I don\u2019t have the backbone to say no, and she pushes back when I try.  Enter my other best friend, Erica (18F), who I\u2019ve known since we were 10. She\u2019s introverted, incredibly kind, and planning for med school, meaning she\u2019s highly study-oriented. She currently lives in expensive student housing but plans to move home next year, which would mean a brutal 1-2 hour commute. If I had chosen her as my roommate originally, she would have benefited from the affordable rent.  Recently, Ava\u2019s parents offered her a free apartment near campus. I was thrilled for her and saw it as the perfect opportunity\u2014she could save money, and Erica could move in, improving her living situation. I told Erica it was a possibility, and she was excited. However, Ava just told me she\u2019s staying because she\u2019s comfortable here and doesn\u2019t want a new roommate. When she told me, I couldn\u2019t hide my disappointment. Now Ava keeps saying it\u2019s my fault for getting Erica\u2019s hopes up and insists I just want to replace her. But I truly think this move would be better for everyone\u2014Ava could grow more independent, save money, and Erica wouldn\u2019t have to commute for hours. I feel like Ava is holding onto me too tightly, and I don\u2019t know how to navigate this. So, Reddit, AITA for wanting my roommate to move out?",

I didn\u2019t take it with me when I moved to the city where I study, I left it at my mom\u2019s house. Since it was fluffy and comfortable, she started sleeping with it every night. After spending a year abroad, I came back to my hometown for a month. Every time I saw that teddy bear, it reminded me of my ex and the moment he gave it to me, so I decided to throw it in the fire without asking my mom. I didn\u2019t think she was that attached to it, I only considered that I didn\u2019t want anything from my ex in the house anymore. Three days later, my mom asked about the teddy bear. When I told her I had burned it, she got really emotional, even to the point of crying. She said she had slept with it every night for the past three years, that it was really comfortable, and that it helped calm her breathing and anxiety. I genuinely hadn\u2019t considered how much it meant to her. I told her I\u2019d buy her a new one, but I haven\u2019t been able to find the exact same one yet. AITA for burning it without asking her first? EDIT: It was not just the teddy bear that I threw, it were all the things I had home from him, and not because I am angry at him or not moved on, but I did not want to have them anymore.

        "selftext": "For context, I have been with my girlfriend for 11 years and I turned vegan 3 years ago for ethical reasons. Before that, I was not eating a lot of meat, but I knew that I was not really doing the best thing (ethically). I was not vegan because I did not want to create any friction with family, friends, etc. but at some point, I decided to go vegan. For me, it doesn't make sense to kill/harm animals when I can just buy a can of chickpeas or buy some tofu instead. My girlfriend understands this and stayed omnivore, because she doesn't want to give up on things that she loves to eat. We live together so, me switching up to veganism obviously impacted her since we cook together only vegan/vegan adaptable meals. She sometimes buys cheese, milk, chicken and fish that she cooks for herself. Other than being vegan, I have a full time job and have many hobbies that take a lot of my time (competing in Ironmans, learning multiple languages, etc), so it is a struggle to spend a lot of good quality time with my girlfriend. Anyway, on her birthday, I came late from work and I went to a restaurant where they make some Poke bowls. I wanted to make her happy and knew that if she was with me, she would order the salmon poke bowl, but I ended up ordering a vegan Poke bowl anyway, because I did not think her birthday would justify me spending money on an industry that I really don't want to encourage. I felt that even tough it would no be her choice, it would still be a nice gesture. When I came back home with the vegan poke bowls, she was disappointed and kind of angry at me because she knew exactly what went in my head when I bought the bows. She felt that even on her birthday, I could not do any compromise and think solely about what she wanted. She says that even when I give something to somebody else, I don't put myself purely in their heads and that I always filter my actions based on MY standards. What do you think ? Edit : Thank you for all your comments. I am a selfish a*hole and definitely have to work on being a better boyfriend and a better person in general. My girlfriend is a wonderful person and I mistreated her. I will put myself more in her shoes next time I want to treat her and put myself and my standards out of the way. ",

        "selftext": "Son's birthday today. He's 5 years old. I wasnt there this morning as stay away from home some nights due to work. Even if had slept at home would have left for work before the kids woke. We have a party planned on Saturday, and will be there at dinner time tonight. I realised that my wife gave my son a present this morning. She said it was from 'us. Apparently she does this every year. I was hurt, and told her so. I thought it was selfish that she couldn't wait to share his excitement.  Her excuse is that it is unfair on him to make him wait. find that ridiculous, and believe he absolutely could wait.  I said the only reason to give it early is the selfishness of wanting to experience his joy alone without sharing it. AITA?  Edit(s): This blew up quicker than I expected (I couldn't get online for the last hour). And overwhelmingly with YTA responses, many with some unfair assumptions so I want to add some context in my defence although I think it wont change the general outcome. 1. Today is his birthday, although we have other special plans. Next week I'm taking 3 days off work, two of which are for a family trip and the third is a special day for my son. I couldn't get today off work though, and Saturday is his proper party, which I obviously will be there. I have a 1.5 hour commute each way (hence why I don't normally see him in the morning before he gets up for school), but I normally read the bedtime story when I'm home and I video call EVERY evening that I'm not home. I'm not an absentee father, and I'm not just a sperm donor. 2. My wife has bought most of the presents but not all of them. We tend to put things in gift bags not wrap them. Last year it was me that bought the main present, this year there wasn't a main present, it was mostly a few smaller ones because the family trips mentioned in (1) are really his main present. I don't expect her to do all the gift shopping and give all the ideas, I do a share of it. She does have more free time than me, and does more of the childcare than me. That's a problem of our (shared) lifechoices and not something that we can easily change. My long commute is primarily due to decisions on her part. 3. Yes, she said she does this every year, but first and second birthday are not quite the same level of concious response, and 3rd and 4th I am not sure what she gave him in the morning. As I mentioned, last year I got the 'main' present, and that was given in the evening I am definitely jealous if she is giving him presents. I definitely want to be part of the enjoyment of his birthday.  I was hurt and didn't understand why he had to receive the present when I wasn't there. Yep he's 5 years old, and every family is different. I don't remember receiving presents until the whole family was there in the evening. I thought that was normal, and assumed my wife had the same thoughts. We hadn't discussed it, and I was upset for missing out.I think if I knew, then I wouldn't have reacted that way, but it was a shock and I was upset. I still am jealous and have some feelings to work through. I don't like my work situation and commute, but I really don't see a way to resolve it (without significant financial risk that I'm not willing to take in this climate) so will have to suck up my disappointment. I called my wife selfish for getting the joy, alone without discussing it first, or without giving me the chance to join on video call. I guess I need to take the YTA verdict. Edit(again):Too many comments to respond to, and can't respond for at least a few hours so that I can spend time with my son on his birthday!",

        "selftext": "Hello!  I (29, M) had an argument with my partner (29, M) over my decision to bail out of my partner's friend's wedding. Some background:I have a pretty bad social anxiety. I'm also not fully out of the closet and struggle with internalise homophobia (I'm not out to my family). I have not been fully comfortable with attending social events with my partner (weddings, parties etc.) as a couple because of my issues. I have made a few attempts but they did not go very well usually (I ended up feeling drained and stressed out). Recently we have been invited to my partner's friend's wedding (I don't know them well at all). He insisted it's important for him that I attend. I understood that and agreed. Recently, however a wedding of my cousin came up, which is actually on the same date as the other wedding. I am not that close to my cousin, but as everyone I am close with will be there, I think it's important for me to attend. Also, my parents made it clear that I should attend. I also live in a different country so I don't see them that often. I think that it is reasonable for me to attend the wedding of my cousin since it is my family instead of some other person's that I do not know well even though they're a friend of my partner. My parents of course do not know I have a partner, therefore I cannot say that I have that other wedding. My partner insisted that I lie to them and say that I am ill or already have a holiday booked, but I don't feel it's right (even though I needed to lie to them on some other occasions). To be honest, even if my parents knew about the situation, I still think it is reasonable for me to attend a wedding that is important for me and to spend some time with my family (and would actually be a bit weird the other way). Now, we had a big fight with my partner over this (the biggest so far). He is saying I broke a promise for an unspecified reason and that he does not want to attend the event on his own again. I however feel that because this is actually not because of my social anxiety or my internalised homophobia that I am not going with him, he is slightly overreacting. He says I do not care about his feelings, which is not true. I simply need to make a choice and this on its own is uncomfortable for me. AITA?",

        "selftext": "Before diving into the problem that happened last week, I need to do some background from previous years. I'm 25 (M) have been playing RPGs with my friends for a long time (about 10 years together), we've tried many systems, books and even made our own RPG (it didn't work out as intended). Around 2020, the pandemic hit my country and my schedule changed, because of that, I had to quit some RPG sessions and deny new ones until I figured out my new schedule. At the time denied an RPG that I really wanted, however, I couldn't commit to participating; the planning started in mid-2020, but it didn't work out so the idea was scraped out. After that, in 2022, the pandemic was much more manageable, and everything was getting back to normal, the RPG plan that I wanted to play with my friends was coming back, but they didn't invite me. The Dungeon Master (DM for short) already had a full team (6 people), and was unable to add one more.At the time, I was the jerk because I started harassing the DM to put me in the game, and this started a big fight (if necessary, I will can be specific in an edit), but long story short, all RPG games with my friends were stopped for 6 months because I created a rift between friends, some understood the context of 2020 and they were on my side, others defended the DM because I denied my seat at the time. In the end, the DM and I apologized for eachother and the RPG did not happen. Now, for the problem that is happening: Another RPG started brewing with another DM (I will call her Anna) started planning a Oneshot, she is already a DM in another RPG session (D&D) that I also play, however, she wanted to also DM Exalted (a really complex system). Anna invited me and 4 other friends to play, at the time I said yes. So the next day I started reading the system and was really intimidated,it has 200+ charms, and alot of specifc rules, so I asked one of the players for help, but it didn't help much. Intimidated and confused, I later told Anna that I was vacating my seat; she was upset but didn't argue, later another friend took my seat. My reasoning to gave up my seat was that I wouldn't commit to a really complex system to play only 1-3 sessions, only if it was a campaign I would comit. A few days passed, and I heard from my friends that Anna was thinking about changing the Exated one-shot to a campaign, and she would stop her D&D campaign for it. I didn't tell my friends at the time, but I was really upset, not only would the one-shot become a campaign, but the other campaigns would stop because of it. So, IATA for asking for my playce back in the campaing with the fear of bringing back that rift and maybe losing some friends?",

Also, every holiday is a family event and we always spend them together, celebrating and what not I wish I could say this isn\u2019t a babb  it but my mother has always favoured my oldest brother. It\u2019s always been frustrating, but it\u2019s never gotten to the point where she\u2019s purposely flying into a different country with him to celebrate a holiday alone.  It became a problem and I told my mom she was being unfair to her two other children who expected to be to father for the holiday. I told her it was clear she cared more about (oldest brother) than me and (younger brother), and that she and him were being selfish bitches.  My mom said that j was being self centred and ruining her and (oldest brothers moment) and he said that j was trying to ruin his trip because i was jealous I don\u2019t think im the asshole, but they both sah that I\u2019m being ridiculous and selfish. Am I the asshole? ",

Simply put, we are in housing with my mother and sister but my girlfriend and mother get along about as well as two male betta fish in a drinking cup (only verbally ofc). Mother informs of a program that let's us build home with other people and eventually that house is given to the members who built it, that way we can still be together as my culture often does. But instead of doing the program to have a house free from strick rules of housing, my girlfriend would rather that we, only her and I, do the project and leave into the new house once done, letting my mother and little sister stay here in housing. Either option leads to consequences I don't like so I ask that if I do as my girlfriend says, WIBTA?",

        "selftext": "Pre-COVID, I (31F) was a bridesmaid for my cousin, Diva (34F). Everything was going smoothly until a few weeks before the wedding. Being artistically inclined, I offered to design her wedding invitations as a gift but made it clear I couldn't produce them myself due to financial constraints, as I was handling my mother's medical bills and our family dog's medication for his heart condition. To provide context, I'm an only child caring for a senior citizen (my mother, who is over 70 years old and a cancer patient) and our senior dog. As the wedding planning progressed, Diva approved my designs with some revisions, and I happily submitted them. However, when the actual invitations arrived, they weren't my designs. This was heartbreaking because if I had been informed that my design wouldn't be used, I would have been fine with it, but no one told me. I let it go and moved on. Regarding the pre-wedding parties, I couldn't attend due to my mother's and our dog's medical conditions, which Diva knew about for months and years prior. Despite this, Diva was upset. I couldn't leave my mother, as there was no one else to care for her, nor could she handle our dog, who needed medication and could be aggressive. Hiring help was also not an option due to financial constraints. The Maid of Honor (MOH) got involved, and I kept asking for consideration due to my family responsibilities. The whole family knew about my mother's condition, and some knew about our dog's condition, but I was told I wasn't fulfilling my bridesmaid duties. I had already designed the invitations and helped with bridesmaid dress choices, but I couldn't attend the pre-wedding parties. This led to a feud among the cousins and eventually reached our parents. Days before the wedding, I was still trying to be a good bridesmaid. Hair and makeup were scheduled for 3 AM, but with my responsibilities, I couldn't leave home at 2 AM. I offered to do my own hair and makeup and even negotiated to arrive before the wedding started, prioritizing the ceremony. However, they wouldn't compromise, so my mother and I decided not to attend to avoid further drama. In hindsight, it was a blessing in disguise because our dog passed away on the wedding day, and we were there for him when he passed.",

        "selftext": "I m(32) was sent to the shopping centre on the way home from work to get lasagne sheets for my wife f(35). I went to the pasta aisle and took a look at the lasagne sheets on offer and found one box that stated \u201cno pre cooking required\u201d so I assumed that would be a great option and got it. Today while driving to lunch my wife said to me that she didn\u2019t mean this as an attack but that she had told me to get fresh lasagne sheets, which are the soft ones in the cold aisle. I told her I didn\u2019t hear her say fresh when she asked me or I would have probably figured out she meant cold. I then asked her what the difference was and why it mattered. She said that the fresh ones cook quicker.I responded that it does say no pre cooking required on the box, assuming maybe this was a newer technology and so it wouldn\u2019t be as long.She said that didn\u2019t matter. I then asked if she had used the no pre cooking required before and compared the cooking times to the fresh ones, since we don\u2019t make lasagne much (I can recall one time in our 7 years together) and I wouldn\u2019t think she would have used these before and was making assumptions. She then started to get angry and said that we always get the fresh ones and if she says she w at the fresh ones then that should be it and she shouldn\u2019t have to justify why she wants them, if she says to get them then just get them. I argued that I always like to educate myself and will clarify and ask questions rather than ever just go ahead and do what you\u2019re told, that isn\u2019t who I am and I should be able to ask questions and clarify. At no point did I say I wouldn\u2019t get the fresh ones in the future or that I was right to get the no pre cook ones, I\u2019m just trying to make sure I understand what the difference is and that she has also considered the differences. She then said that the way I was saying it was defensive and right fighting and that she felt I wasn\u2019t listening to her because I was asking all these questions rather than just saying \u201cyes dear\u201d.I continued to explain that I was just trying to understand and clarify, I wasn\u2019t defending that I was right to get those sheets or that I wouldn\u2019t get the fresh ones in the future but she said it didn\u2019t matter because of the way it was making her feel.She wasn\u2019t able to clarify what about my tone or words or mannerisms was making her feel that way rather than just feeling like I\u2019m trying to understand. So I don\u2019t know how to avoid this in the future but not just end up as a mindless \u201cyes dear\u201d robot. Am I the asshole because I tried to understand why she wanted fresh sheets instead of just noting to get fresh sheets next time?",

        "selftext": "Okay so some background, I am a female high school student and I am dating a boy in high school as well. However, we go to different schools. This Saturday he has his snowball dance and 3 weeks ago we talked about it and mutually decided we\u2019d go to my schools because he didn\u2019t wanna go to his and he thought mine would be more fun so I agreed. I wanted to go to both but didn\u2019t push because I didn\u2019t want to make him do smth he didn\u2019t want to. I figured it wouldn\u2019t be an issue. A few days ago he asked what day my dance was on and I told him \u201cit\u2019s in two weeks\u201d and he said \u201coh okay cool because my friends just invited me to go to my schools dance and stay the night at his house.\u201d And I got a little hurt and said \u201cwhy are you going? I thought you didn\u2019t want to because it was lame\u2026?\u201d And he said \u201cwell I just got invited and I think I\u2019d be fun with my friends.\u201d and we js left it at that. Today, the topic was brought up again and I told him I was uncomfortable with the idea because there are quite a few girls at his school that I\u2019m very suspicious of, there is a girl he\u2019s friends with who is going, and it was weird to go to a school dance with your friends when you have a gf. He told me I was being paranoid and he wasn\u2019t gonna cheat and he js wanted to have fun with friends. I told him I was fine with him hanging out with his friends but maybe in a setting I was more comfortable with. He said I was being dramatic and it was js an innocent hang out, I told him it was weird to go with your friends and he said \u201ceveryone went with each other last time\u201d and I told him \u201cyeah that\u2019s bc they don\u2019t have gfs\u201d and he got all annoyed. I\u2019ve talked with 4 of my good girl friends, 1 male friend, my brother, my parents, and a family friend and all of them think it\u2019s a little odd. I tried explaining my whole side of things and how I would prefer if he skipped so I\u2019d be more comfortable and he just told me girls don\u2019t like him, he\u2019s not interested, and I\u2019m being annoying and pissing him off because he just wants to hang out with his friends. I know this is very stupid and trivial, but these are my issues and I\u2019m only in high school once. Let me have little problems now. Am I the asshole for arguing with my bf over this? Edit: On Wednesday he said he would go to my basketball game and then backed out last minute (like an hour before) and told me he\u2019d hang out with me Friday and Sunday to make up for it. I got a text yesterday (Thursday) where he told me he was also spending the night with his friends on Friday night. I got upset and told him that was going to mess up our plans and he got mad at me and said he never does anything with them and he wants to see them. He has a sleep over with them every 2 weeks and when I want to do things with friends I never can because I\u2019m cancelling stuff to be with him. I\u2019ve had people over in October and that was the last time that happened. He ended up breaking up with me because I\u2019m too controlling, according to him. Everyone I\u2019ve talked to thinks that yes I should\u2019ve handled it better and shouldn\u2019t have gotten as upset as I did, but I also explained to him that I wasn\u2019t telling him he couldn\u2019t see his friends but that I was upset that he planned over our previously made plans. He disregarded what I said and how I was feeling. Everyone he talked to about it told him it was extremely impulsive and that he should\u2019ve thought about it more. I skipped school today because I am absolutely devastated. His friends are all trying to talk sense into him and say he\u2019s crazy\u2026 I don\u2019t know what to do now\u2026",

        "selftext": "(Fixed for the people with no reading comprehension.) This is just regular teenage drama, but today I was talking with my friends. Let's call them Beck, Tanny, Hazel, and Abs. I was talking to Abs and Beck, recently Beck and Hazel have been having drama over a boy (of course) and Hazel has been dragging it for months now, Beck and I were talking about how Hazel kept dragging it and about what Abs told us about what Hazel has said about Beck. Now it wasn't good stuff, Hazel was saying Beck was a bad person and that she was a slut.  Beck and I decided to make a group chat with Abs to all talk about it and Beck decided to confront Hazel, Hazel claimed she knew nothing about it even though both me and Abs have heard her say it. After that was over me and Abs agreed to texted Hazel and say we didn't want to be friends her anymore. Since Hazel was the type of person to talk crap about people Abs and I assumed there was stuff about us too. We both texted Hazel and explained. My reasoning was that Hazel kept dragging us into unnecessary drama and that I was worried she was talking crap about us, there was also the fact that Hazel was extremely open about her sexual life with her boyfriend (keep in mind we are ALL minors). She got upset claiming she has never talked shit, then heres were Tanny comes in.  Hazel brings Tanny into the conversation and Tanny starts arguing saying that Hazel never talked shit and that we had no proof of any of our claims, even though Hazel is extremely public about her gossip and personal life. Tanny then started posting about us publicly. Not only that but she then started sending Beck threats to hurt her. Me being tired of the harassment, I decided to just block them. Now that I think about it, I don't really feel bad at all. But theres still the fact it sort of seems that it was me who escalated the situation because it was my idea in the first place to message Hazel and tell her I didn't want to be friends.  I personally think my reasoning was valid because no child should be having sex nor causing unnecessary fights and drama over small things, but I want to know if this makes me the bad guy in this situation. I knew she was struggling with mental health, I knew she had trouble with her parents, and I knew this would affect her, but I still did it. Am I the asshole for this situation escalating and affecting someone, or was I in the right to unfriend her? I'm most likely the asshole in this situation, but I just made this so me and my friends could turn it into one of those Minecraft AI YouTube shorts videos. Thanks for reading!",

My mother in law also works at the same place so she has easy access to the daycare. At least once a week she goes and spends 30 minutes to an hour just playing with my daughter. This rubs me the wrong way for so many reasons. As a mom, it frustrates me that she thinks it\u2019s okay to just drop by whenever without at least saying something or asking (I actually just found out while writing this that she tells my husband but nobody communicates it with me). As a former daycare worker, I would have hated having someone just come in and spend time with a child because now not only do they have infants to watch, but now they have to work around a fully grown woman and make sure that she isn\u2019t taking pictures/videos of other babies as well. I think my biggest issue is honestly that some days she gets to spend more awake time with my daughter than I do and I know that\u2019s a horrible reason to be frustrated with someone but it is what it is. Would I be the asshole if I asked her to stop visiting daycare so frequently? She comes to our house and gets to spend several hours with my daughter at least once a week so it\u2019s not like daycare is the only time she gets to see her.   ETA: Yes. I know I\u2019m the asshole for being jealous. After talking with my husband, I\u2019m realizing a lot of these feelings are based on big emotions from being exhausted and PPD. I don\u2019t hate my mother in law. This is my first and probably only child and she\u2019s my rainbow baby so I\u2019m very protective. For those of you that politely told me I\u2019m the asshole, thank you. For those of you that told me I need to see a therapist, already seeing one for my chronic depression and added postpartum depression so I\u2019m good.

He then proceeded to tell me that I was a selfish loser and walks off. I feel like not wanting someone to disrupt your rhythm, and also not wanting to share with someone who is sweating is a fair enough reason to not share your equipment. But isn\u2019t it also my right to use the equipment by myself if I so choose? I thought it was natural that sometimes machines are in use and you just have to wait? Just wondering if I\u2019m the A for not wanting to share, and wondering whether my gym etiquette logic needs rethinking thanks.",

        "selftext": "I (28F) live with my boyfriend (28M). I work a state govt job that keeps me out late while his job in IT is flexible so he works from home sometimes. We have been dating for a couple years now and recently he moved in with me. I bought the house and pay the mortgage for it entirely. My BF does not pay me any rent since he is currently in a low paying job and actively looking for better options. However he also has the longer commute to work so he pays more for gas now ever since he moved in because previously he lived closer to his workplace. Until he finds a new job, he told me he unable to contribute for the mortgage and hasn't asked to be on the deed either. He does however pay half the utilities and half of the groceries too. He has been extra conscious about not contributing to the mortgage or paying any rent. Since he doesn't pay rent, he tries to make up for it by doing almost all of the cooking for both of us. He also does the laundry and dishes most of the times without complaint. And when I ask him for help cleaning the house like mopping the floors, he helps with that too. He also packs my lunch every morning to save me the trouble of getting up early. I am really lucky that he does all of this. However, he does make a mess (kitchen and bathroom) and his cleaning isn't as good as when I would do it. We also buy a lot of groceries which we have nowhere to put since the house is somewhat small which makes the house a mess again. I didn't have this problem when I was living by myself so it has started to irritate me quite a bit over time. This past weekend, when he was cooking, he happened to drop rice and some sauce on the floor and hadn't cleaned up after so I told him you need to be more careful about dropping things on the floor cause you make a mess sometimes. It caused him to get upset and he started profusely cleaning the floors. Then he proceeded to tell me I know this is your house, but it feels like I need to tiptoe around you here because I am not keeping the place exactly how you want it. I make a mess sometimes but I always clean up after. Might not be immediately but I do get to it and I do my best. I'm sorry that isn't good enough. And this isn't the first time you've said this. He told me the other time this happened was when he was cleaning out our oven and while scrubbing the burnt bits, it dropped black spots all over the white floor which irritated me. And apparently I had told him that he didn't do a good job cleaning the floor one time when I had asked him to do it. After he told me all this, I got upset because and started crying and he spent the next hour consoling me. I am neurotic about keeping the place clean - especially my kitchen since I have had a rodent problem. Ever since this, I have always found him on all fours on the kitchen floor trying to find every last speck of food because I feel like he is convinced that I would get upset again. AITA for telling him he made a mess in the first place and wanting to keep my house clean? EDIT: Clarified being on the deed EDIT 2: I deleted all my replies to the comments because I kept getting downvoted on every single one. I don't understand the downvotes to my replies when I have only thanked the commenters, been civil with my replies and taken their suggestions as good ones and agreeing to make some changes in myself.

Every week when my parents aren\u2019t home on a day, my brother and I take turns ordering items for three of us (me and my two brothers) using funds our dad gives onto our cards. On top of that, each of us has saved around $3,000 from birthday money saved for future expenses (such as university) I\u2019m considering withdrawing my $2,600 so that if our dad\u2019s money ever runs low, I won\u2019t have to dip into my own hard-earned cash. Since if my brother runs out of money, my dad will just add more money to it. However, my dad thinks I should also consider my brothers\u2019 needs. I\u2019m planning to use this money for an iPad for university\u2014 (waiting for an new model is coming out in about 7-8 months) \u2014and I\u2019m worried that if I dip into my own money, I might not have enough left for 10% of the cost of an iPad by the time it comes out. By the way, my dad works extremely hard to get us into private schools and pay houses. He also owns a few small companies, and sometimes he needs to borrow money.  However, I would say we are decently well off and my two brothers recently got the IPhone 16 Pro Max (I didn\u2019t get one, but he offered to one day get me an MacBook to make it even). For university, I would heavily prefer an IPad over an MacBook but I feel like it would be harder without an MacBook, which is why I would wanna take out my own money for an iPad along the MacBook.

We had 8-2, better than JV and Varsity had this year. We had spent all of our Sumner practicing and grinding every day until the season started. Well, one day in practice (in the middle of July) after warm-ups, I had given a suggestion to our Coach about how the defense needs to work on their hand movement and the way they should go when the ball is snapped. BTW, our defense sucked this summer.....i was on defense\ud83d\ude11. And, he looked at me, like he's my dad when I did something stupid, and I said, What? He said.Well, can't it wait?! Half of the people were on my side, and half were on the coach's. I still continued, and all I said that made him really mad was, Maybe if you weren't so soft on us, then Defense would've sucked right now. And I wanna add one more person, he's another coach, he had served time in the military, and as soon as he heard me what I said , he said All, right. Since yall were soft, LEMME MAN YOU THE F*CK UP! And made all of us run nonstop until practice is over. If we slow down, it is more minutes, walking and talking, more minutes. Luckily, we finished before I had a heart attack, and everyone knew not to give coach obvious facts to anger or punish us like that ever again. AITA? Edit 2/5/25: Okay, yes, ITA, but if yall wanna know if my team hated me or not, no, they didn't hate me, they didn't clown on my ass, we just simply laughed it off and that was that.",

She TEXTED me I don't feel anything for you like someone in a romantic relationship would. I think our relationship changed and i lost feelings.  I tried to understand why she lost feelings, asked her what she wanted to do. Take a break? End things completely? She would ALWAYS tell me i dont know.  Every question i asked her she would say that she didnt know. We were in this situation for like 3 days, i wanted answers, a reason why she wanted to leave me, what she wanted to do from here, but i got none.  Eventually i got fed up and told her I need an answer, you cant just fool me around, i deserve to know what you want to do and why you wanted to do it.  Mind you, this is all over text... we live 20 min away from each other but okay. She finally said she wanted to break up because she thinks no one can re-gain feelings for someone which i dont agree but thats not the point. Now that you have a backstory: would I be the asshole if i asked her for some expensive gifts i gave her?  I spent a lot of my money that I made working my ass off in sound and music production. I don't have a stable job, just little ones that i get offered from time to time because im also in college full time.  I gave her a lot of plushies and sylvanian families that she loves, which cost a lot of money... so i kinda want to ask for them back so i can sell them. I dont know if this is an asshole move.

Sharon and her husband(Vlad) rented out almost the whole resort and paid for a villa for me and my parents to stay in. This villa had a pool (all to ourselves!!) and two separate mini buildings, one for living and one for lounging. This wedding was VERY extravagant with a lot of Vlad's business partners. Their business social life is the type where you are drunk all day making fun of people; each business associate was pretty fat with a wife who had crazy Botox and plastic surgery. After the beach ceremony, we were escorted to a dining/dance space where lots of speeches were given. One of the speeches was given by a business associate's wife(who fits the beauty standard explained above). Her speech was pretty unremarkable, and I wasn't paying much attention until she mentioned Sharon's Son's help with her business called Blackwater. I'm not sure if she made the connection to the infamous mercenary firm, but it made me *almost* laugh, I held it in UNTIL she proceeded to explain what her company was about: water with minerals in it, making it black. Basically, it was dirt water that cracked me up like crazy, and I couldn't hold it in. The room was completely silent before this, and everyone's heads whipped towards me. The speech went on, but it was very awkward. After we finished dinner I was pulled over by Sharon who scolded me for laughing and said that everyone was asking her who I was and why I laughed. Apparently the girl felt very embarrassed and self-conscious after I cracked up. People have been treating me like a pariah ever since. 1.

        "selftext": "My husband just received a promotion/new job offer at his job. His place of employment has historically not been a positive place and has been the cause of deep stress for him and strain on our relationship; however, it was recently bought out so company ownership is different and this new position would be kind of a fresh start. He let me know about his new position after he accepted it yesterday. He said that he cares how I feel about it and that he knows it has been rough but he thinks this will be a good thing. I do have mixed feelings, but I am incredibly happy for him and proud and I let him know that. I let it sit and gathered my feelings about all of it and then tried to talk to him about it today. I told him that I am happy and excited for him and that I want to support him in this, want to ensure we respect each other\u2019s feelings, and communicate so we can move forward positively together. He lost it. He said that I hate his job and will never be happy, that he does not want to discuss it - ever -, that he should not have to be my therapist and talk to me about it\u2026 the list goes on. I repeatedly told him I am happy and that I am not upset or angry and that it was a conversation about moving forward with mutual respect and positivity and I did not understand why he was angry and asked if he could tell me what he is upset about so I can try and understand. He could not tell me and just kept saying he never wants to discuss it and that I just always cause problems and am never happy. I am at a loss. I told him I apologize if I miscommunicated somehow, but I literally just wanted him to know that I support him and that even though it has been tough there I want us to move forward supporting and respecting each other (that is the text I sent him verbatim). AITA here? ** update - the stress and strain I refer to is that he has been so stressed he has stopped taking care of himself, going to workouts (which he loves), being angry at everything and snapping at everything all the time. He knows he is doing that and apologize saying he is sorry and that he is just stressed and needs to find a new job because he can\u2019t take it, feels disrespected there, and feels terrible for taking it out on our family. So it has affected our family. ",

        "selftext": "I (23F) have a friend (24F) who is currently in uni in another country. Her family is pretty strict so being far away from them made her go a little wild. Recently she was ranting to me about how her first kiss experience. She and her uni friends went clubbing, where she drank heavily and got drunk, but not drunk enough to fully black out, being still lucid enough to be aware of her surroundings and actions. According to her, this guy started approaching her, and they ended up grinding and eventually the guy kissed her, and it escalated into a full make out session.  The next morning she immediately regretted letting the guy do that to her and she called me for support.  While she described the story, it seemed like she wanted me to reassure her that the kiss didn\u2019t count or to sympathize with her. However, I found it hard to comfort her, or for sorry for what she experienced,  because firstly she knew her friends that went with her were going to be drinking heavily as well so there\u2019s no one looking out for her and she\u2019s going to be on her own. Secondly, she consented to the guy kissing her at that point (not saying no/pushing him/walking away) and also she kissed him back which was what caused the kiss to become a full make out session.  I knew she could\u2019ve done something because after the kiss happened the grinding continued and she began feeling uncomfortable about the guy starting to touch her inappropriately and so she walked away right away so it\u2019s not like she couldn\u2019t have done anything if she did not want him to kiss her. She just regretted giving away her first kiss to a total stranger who she doesn\u2019t even remember.  I didn\u2019t say much on the call and didn\u2019t offer the reassurance she seemed to be seeking. I felt conflicted because I think she willingly engaged in the situation and only regretted it afterward. However, I wonder if I was wrong for not being more supportive as her friend. I might be victim blaming as well for thinking that she should\u2019ve been more careful and responsible about her alcohol intake, knowing that she has no one watching out for her.  AITA? EDIT: I did not say much on the call as I was in complete shock that this happened to her. I was in no way judging her and I feel really bad that her first kiss (which is something she was looking forward to) was taken away like this. I am just wondering if I am the AH for not showing her the support that she wanted me to ie telling her it doesn\u2019t count as her first kiss. I did not tell her off or voice any of my \u201cjudgemental\u201d opinions I just listened.  EDIT 2: My friend asked me and I quote \u201cIt doesn\u2019t count right\u201d as to whether this is her first kiss experience or not I am not assuming anything.  ",

Now I have to get out of bed to turn it off, and I HATE it... Like I don't even know how to describe how much it annoys and irritates me... I am not a morning person, and he knows this, and I have my own morning routine as to make sure I am not grumpy towards everyone in the morning. But turning off his alarm messes up my routine and makes me really frustrated in the morning. Even more so when he asks me to turn off his alarm on my day off. My bf has his own company and prefers to be early at his office. So his alarm is usually set about 40 minutes before my alarm. But sometimes it is also set 10 minutes before my alarm goes off. He will ask me to 'please turn it off one more time' and then stay in bed till my alarm goes. Now this is where I might be the AH, because the extra time in bed he mostly spends cuddling me and I really love it. Before this all started he used to turn off his alarm himself and come back to bed to cuddle, but that doesn't happen anymore.

I don\u2019t wish to leave as I have my whole life here; I just started UNI, my boyfriend and friends live here and my dog \u2018wouldn\u2019t make the trip\u2019. I am unable to work currently as I am chronically ill and am unsure of how my body would react to both full-time study and work. I get government assistance of $210/Weekly which will be unable to cover rent for anywhere but a single room in a share house but I won't be able to bring my dog. I am left in a position where I would have to financially rely on my BF more than I would like to and would be homeless if we ever broke up. I have brought these issues up to my mom and asked her for a bit more time until I qualify for student housing and can find a nice family to take my dog. However, everyone keeps saying that I am ruining this for her and that I should move overseas with them. She has dreamed of moving for years and is now \u2018able\u2019 to, but especially since her health is degrading, she is losing time to move. Should I give in and leave everything behind or do I stand my ground? EDIT:  Just want to clarify some things. - My relationship isn't new, its 2 years old.  - My dog isn't dying or old, she is just an anxious dog.  - My mom isn't actively dying, she is just getting old and has pre-existing health conditions.  - Yes, I could move to this new country but I would loose the specific program I got into that they do not offer there as well as my scholarship which would put me through Uni.  - I am currently applying to get more government assistance but it would only go into effect after she leaves  - I haven't had a job as my mother advised me not to and originally told me that she would financially support me through schooling  - pet friendly rentals are rare in Australia  - I cannot stay in my current house as the landlord doesn't want a first-time renter staying here.  - My family do not have anything lined up for them in the new place, no jobs, no education, no housing.   - I asked for them to postpone the move until the end of the year so that I can apply for student housing and rehome my dog    ",

I made similar videos (never with the same audio) about the same topic because he and I were really well versed in it. Since his initial video blew up he made numerous other videos with that same audio. All of which preformed well. We both supported each other tremendously and always helped each other with videos whenever we could. Our videos went from 200-500 views to 10s of 100s of thousands. This was big for us as we had been trying to reach an audience for a couple years. But It all changed overnight. One day whole brain storming video ideas, I became inspired but my friends video and decided to make a video using the audio and format from his initial post that blew up. I was excited to tell him about it and show it to him before posting. That night while we were gaming I told him about my idea. His mood instantly changed and I could tell he was bothered. He flat out told me that I was stealing his thing. He asked me if I told you not to post that you wouldn't post it right? To which I replied no. As much as I love Jacob I was never gonna let him dictate what I do and don't post on social media. As in the past he has tried to be rather controlling of myself and other friends. He tried telling me that audio is my thing in this community and you're basically stealing my ir I told him that's how trends and social media works. One person makes something and everyone else copies. He kept calling it my audio when he wasn't even the one who created it. He followed a similar format to everyone else who used it, just specific to our niche. There was a lot of back and forth of him telling me not to but me standing my ground. I went as far as saying \u201cnothing bad can happen to you if I post this\u201d to which he said \u201cyou don\u2019t know that\u201d He wouldn't budge and said straight up I don't want you posting that. It's my thing. I told him I'm sorry but no, you're not gonna dictate this. At the end of the day I didn't end up posting the video, mainly because I was never going to prioritize social media over our friendship. He got off the game when the conversation ended. We still send each other posts every now and again but we haven't had a conversation since then. So am I the asshole for not taking down my post because my friend told me to.",

        "selftext": "My wife, Emma, and I have a 16-year-old dog named Sky who was recently diagnosed with an aggressive, fast-growing form of cancer. The kind that can\u2019t be cut out easily.  Given this, Sky\u2019s age, and other health issues, the vet didn't recommend treatment. Instead, he's got some pain medication to help keep him comfortable, and we were told to keep an eye on the cancerous lump on his chest.  That lump has gone from pea-sized to the size of a large grapefruit in under two months. Sky\u2019s incontinence is more frequent, and his back legs now give out regularly. He doesn't enjoy playing in the yard or chasing a ball and has become fussier about what he eats. He's also sleeping more\u2014up to 22 hours a day. The vet has said as the growth gets bigger, it's more likely to rupture, which would require urgent veterinary care. At that point, it's likely that Sky would need to be euthanized. It's possible that this could happen outside of our vet's usual hours, which would mean we'd need to take him to the emergency animal hospital. Given all of this, I've tried talking with Emma several times about whether it is still in Sky's best interests to continue on. I think the time has come to have him euthanized. This would allow us to ensure that his passing was as gentle as possible, in a place that is familiar and without the added stress of a medical emergency. The vet has said it's up to us, and he'd support whatever decision we made. Emma thinks that we shouldn't put him down just because things have become harder for us. He does still wag his tail when he sees us and enjoys scratches, but the vet has said that dogs can be really good at hiding when they're in pain, and I think that's what's happening here. Emma doesn't see it that way and thinks that because he's not overtly suffering, we should let him live out whatever life he has left. Also relevant: I work from home, so I'm the one at home with him every day. We've discussed what I should do if something happens and she's away for work. She's told me I should do what needs to be done even if I can't get hold of her or she can't get there. It seems she's accepted that he's close to the end of his life but maybe doesn't want to have to be the one to make the decision to end it? Yesterday, I had a sudden thought that I should just tell Emma that something happened during a time when she's not available and take him to the vet myself. It shook me that I'd thought of it, to be honest. Our relationship is built on a strong foundation of trust, and I know that if I were to do something like this and she found out, there would be no coming back from that. Our 20-year relationship would be over. However, I can't stop thinking about how it could be the best thing for Sky. So, I thought I'd ask the internet: would I be the a-hole if I had my wife's dog put down and lied to her about why? UPDATE: Thank you to everyone who has taken the time to share their stories. I really appreciate all the comments (yes, I\u2019ve read them all) and I\u2019m going to take the advice to continue talking with Emma about what\u2019s best for Sky. Hopefully, I can help her realize that it\u2019s time for us to say goodbye but if not, I\u2019ll continue to support them both as best I can through this difficult process. ",

        "selftext": "Both me and my friend, Jane, go to a really competitive high school--but because we're friends, we never let it really get between us. We both even applied to a lot of top scholarship (QuestBridge, Gates, Coca-Cola, etc) and made it to finalist stages for QuestBridge together. In December, Jane matched to Duke University and only had to pay $10,000 over the course of four years. I did not get matched, so I did not receive the scholarship, but made finalist for the Gates Scholarship. This didn't tear our friendship apart but instead brought us closer--I was sad, of course, but I was happy for her. Fast forward to earlier today. She heard back from another big scholarship, and I told her to rescind her application as she already has QuestBridge. She did. Then, she heard back from another, and I told her, again, that she didn't need the money and to leave the opportunity for someone else who did. A couple hours passed, and she comes up to me asking for help with her essay, and I look at it with her. Then, she tells me that it was highly inconsiderate of me to tell her to rescind her applications, especially because I knew how much she needed it. At this point, I had taken two exams back-to-back, and was fed up w ppl. So I told her how it wasn't fair for people like me who didn't get matched, but deserved the money just as much as her. She then says how they have medical bills back from when her mom had cancer, and that it wasn't fair to her family that they pay for her school. I said that she could take a job, both during the summer and in college, so that they don't have to pay for her, but she stormed off. Now, I'm scared that I ruined our friendship, especially with something as small as this.  So, AITA?",

        "selftext": "Okay so. At school I have this one particular friend. This friend I\u2019ve known since last year but we started to be closer friends this year being my senior year, but for some reason I don\u2019t know how I never noticed but this friend smells absolutely terrible. I try to warn him about this because I don\u2019t want him to get made fun of by other people but he doesn\u2019t believe me because the only people he hangs out with are \u201cweird\u201d kids who I am kind of forced to be friends with because I\u2019m friends with him. And those kids do NOT fucking shower and don\u2019t care about hygiene enough to tell him. I try to assure him I\u2019m not lying and tell him in private so I don\u2019t embarrass him but it just never changes, he lies and says he cleans his clothes everyday but he wears the exact same thing every day. He isn\u2019t financially unstable or poor either, he is able to afford a lot of things I\u2019ve seen in the past. He just genuinely doesn\u2019t believe he smells bad. I feel as though being around him kind of harms my reputation because people will assume it\u2019s me who smells but it\u2019s really him, and I feel like such a dick sometimes for trying to be blunt and honest with him but it is to complete deaf ears. What\u2019s worse is that every morning I sit in this specific spot where I enjoy my personal time before class, but this year he found my spot and there followed all the other kids who also act odd. I started distancing myself from him and sitting in different places trying to avoid him because I genuinely cannot bear the way he smells and the people he brings along. And I\u2019m not just hating on the people he brings because they\u2019re \u201cweird\u201d, they are actually horrible people who constantly talk crazy amounts of shit about me and contribute to rumors spread on me, and whenever I tell them it bothers me they look at me as if I\u2019m fucking weirdo. Also I was planing on asking out a girl who sits near the place where me and him sit, and for some fucking reason whenever I tell him about this he snaps back and looks dead at her and says \u201cWHO HER?\u201d, this was my final straw that made me decide I am done spending time with this guy. I currently sit in a different spot in the morning and I try to tell him it\u2019s for a different reason but he genuinely will not stop talking to me at every opportunity and I just told him one day \u201cBro you smell like fucking shit please stop talking\u201d and he looked at me crazy. I dunno, am I the asshole for this? ",

He is best friends with a freshman which I will call Jake (15M). Jake and my nephew have been best friends since the beginning of the school year. They hang out frequently and tend to call everyday to play games. My nephew is bisexual and he rarely discloses this information except people he trusts, like Jake. I was informed by my nephew that Jake's friend, Danny, has spread fear and disturbing rumors about their friendship. My nephew told me that Danny and Jake are in a turbulent spot with their friendship, therefore things have been heated between the two. So Danny has taken note that my nephew and Jake are close buddies, and has projected his anger on my nephew to spread libel about him.  Danny, Danny's mom, and Jake's mom are all linked together like espionage. While Danny and Jake were fighting, he secretly hijacked information between Danny and my nephew's friendship. Please note that Jake and my nephew are not romantically involved. So Danny's mom saw my nephew and Jake riding on an electric scooter together, which she has blown out of proportion in the context that my nephew and Jake are in a relationship. Then, my nephew told me that Danny came to the conclusion he is gay because of a joke Jake made while they all had lunch together. Danny has communicated with his mother in malice of my nephew, and spreads fear about my nephew's sexuality to Jake's mom. Jake's mom and Danny's mom are best friends, and have been in communication about this. Now, Jake's mom is accusing my nephew of grooming and influencing Jake to identifyas LGBT. My nephew has NOT DONE THAT. Now, my nephew and Jake have a strained relationship because his parents banned Jake from speaking to my nephew due to these horrific rumors. Even though my nephew is an adult, I feel like I need to take this to the school. I want to confront the parents for overdramatizing and hijacking information about my nephew's sexuality. With the fact he is 18, I fear they could exacerbate it considering the political climate in the US. WIBTA?",

I'm entirely *okay* with her needing to be alone but she refused to actually admit that or communicate with me until I basically said, either tell me what's fucking going on or take the space you so clearly need already. This started basically two weeks ago. My friend shut down without telling me what was going on. I still don't know the entire story of why she did tbh. Then, about a week ago she said she was ready to talk again and explained a little about how why she shut down but not the whole reason. She said she was ready to talk again but she *very* clearly wasn't. I kept telling her that if she needed more space I genuinely did not care and would give her that, she didn't say she did.  Then these past few days she started replying to the first few messages I'd send then ignoring me entirely the rest of the day. Again I said if she needed space to tell me that. She didn't. This morning she said she's trying to distance herself from everyone and that she's used to being alone almost all the time. Finally it came to a head just a few minutes ago and I called her out. I basically laid it out for her, I said either tell me what's going on and let's settle this or take your space already but stop pretending like there's nothing wrong.  Keep in mind. This is a friend I'd been talking to pretty much 24/7 for the past two to three months. We'd gotten really, REALLY close, she told me things very few people in her life know. I think I have a right to say something, to be worried when she basically disappears on me, comes back, but then *everything* is different than it was before and she essentially says she has no plans of things going back to how they were beforehand.

        "selftext": "Ok so I\u2019m really pissed off and disappointed at my bf of 10 years. On Thursday he had to fly from Canada to Jamaica for his grandpas funeral. He invited me to go but decided he wasn\u2019t going to bring me anymore, I was upset he didn\u2019t end up bringing me because he decided to fly with his brothers instead so whatever I had to just deal with it. We have never went on a trip outside of the country without each other so that\u2019s why it was disappointing. I even packed his suitcase and helped him convert money to Jamaican dollars and literally helped him with booking the ticket, even though again I was mad I still did it for him. He specifically told me he\u2019s not going down there for fun, said he\u2019s only there for the funeral and to mourn the death of his grandpa. Tell me why I check his location and he\u2019s at a fucking resort the day AFTER the funeral which is 4 hours away from his grandpas house? When I asked him he told me it\u2019s not a resort, he\u2019s at a hotel. LIES! I google it and it\u2019s a resort in negril, with a nice beach, pools, buffet, LOUD music. Who is he trying to fool? And yes that made me upset because again, he\u2019s there without me and I know he would be upset too if I did the same thing. And LIED about it. AGAIN, I was forced to get over it. So this is the cherry on top of why I\u2019m angry. Before he left to Jamaica, I sent him $200 Canadian dollars to cover what I asked for which was roasted breadfruit, which is hard to find here where I live. I specifically asked for 6 of them which cost less than $5 Canadian dollars. That\u2019s all I asked for. The only reason I asked for that was because I know his mom brings down so much food, she brings more than 6 roasted breadfruits, fruit, a lot of raw fish and bottles of wine and beer. So I know she had no issues going through customs. Tell me why he calls me today, I asked him what he bought me and all he bought me was 1 FUCKING BREADFRUIT. Mind you, I ASKED him and PAID for it so he can make it up to me by him excluding me on the trip. He told me he\u2019s going to have issues with customs and then called me ungrateful. I told him I only fucking asked for that and he didn\u2019t even try to make me happy considering how he excluded me and went to a fucking resort without me and tried to lie about it. Do I even have the right to be angry?? I told him he can keep it for himself and asked for my money back. AITA?Ps the reason I\u2019m so upset is because I have the biggest heart and do so much for him and spoil him and he doesn\u2019t even fucking try to reciprocate it back, I\u2019m not asking for the exact same but at least try. And he fucking didn\u2019t. ",

At this point it felt like he was low-key trying to brag so I told him dude stop it you don't even sound that good. He asked me wdym and I told him I'm sure she could actually tell he's deaf by his voice but was probably just being kind. He got upset blamed me with being jealous. I had a crush on this girl some time ago. But idgaf about her anymore. I was just annoyed by him humble bragging. I said yeah think whatever you want to, but she prob felt awkward around you and was just tryna be nice and lighten the mood. So quit acting as if she insulted you. He insulted me then told me I'm supposed to be his friend not his enemy. We haven't talked since then. Mutual friends think he was being annoying but I acted like an AH.   AITA?",

I (19 M) was talking to my coworker (26 F) about how my ex stepdad/My brother's dad was supposed to help me move in one Friday (he offered because I was living with him), but when I called to ask him if he was ready and he was confused on what I was meaning and he didn't know we would be doing it so early in the day. (it was a little before noon but he was told a week before when and what day) He had to go to one of his younger kids school to have birthday lunch with her which was fine I said we could do it after, but his now girlfriend ( not my mom) said I was trying to ruin her daughters bday and I was an asshole and must of planned it. So he hung up called me back and asked if he could do it Saturday, but I had to stay at a family friends house to watch their dogs and so I said that was fine and I would send him a picture of how I wanted it since I couldn't be there to help him or do it myself. Well he had got there threw it in my room not at all how I sent him and my roomates family had to do it because they felt bad.  I was upset more because they had to do it and I didn't say anything to him about it and still thanked him for doing it... but my coworker said I was an asshole for trying to make him  set up my whole house and I was being entitled. I feel like considering I had it all planned for him but he forgot about it inconveniencing me and then I couldn't be there I was in my rights to be frustrated with him... So am I the Asshole?  edit-  I feel like people are coming at me because I started a fight with him or something but like the the oh post I thanked him for doing it and offered gas to which he said no to, I didn\u2019t argue with him about it but I feel I should still be able to be upset that he didn\u2019t do it when he said he would and told my roommate and her family he knew how I wanted it but didn\u2019t care to do and said I wouldn\u2019t mind in left.  obviously I do mind and he didn\u2019t put like pictures or thing small things like that for me up he just had to put a bed and my desk in there and that was it. I was unable to be there because he had forgot to plan accordingly which lapsed into my plans I had to watch a house which has been set in stone months in advanced thank you for ur comments! ",

        "selftext": " My brother (24M) and I (22F) are living at our parents\u2019 house with two siblings until our finances are sorted. Some of us are learning new skills and breaking into careers while we don\u2019t have to worry about bills. I\u2019ve had issues with my older brother (Jamal, placeholder name) before, but lately, he\u2019s been combative. He talks to our two older sisters behind our backs and seems convinced by them our parents are controlling and don\u2019t want us independent. He\u2019s a pain; he doesn\u2019t say anything bad directly, but he goes out of his way to eat healthily and restrict himself in front of me, making me feel bad about my body and weight. He pretends to be supportive, though. He opens canned beans without our mom\u2019s permission, knowing he\u2019s supposed to ask to avoid a mess. His excuse is he bought it with his own money, claiming he doesn\u2019t make messes (he doesn\u2019t, to be fair). Mom gets mad at me whenever he does this, so I have to tell her, which he doesn\u2019t like since it\u2019s \u201cnot my business\u201d and \u201cthis is a problem between me and mom, not you.\u201d He does the same with eggs, setting aside food for himself to \u201csave time\u201d while working on other stuff, which is unfair. Again, he uses the excuse he bought it with his money, but if I have no money, I doubt he does either. He eats more food than us, but I get the impression he thinks he\u2019s better than us because it\u2019s \u201chealthy\u201d or he \u201cworks out,\u201d spending half his day walking around the house or outside. None of this is good for his mental health, and he never listens to us. After I took a shower, I needed to tell our mother something, so I called her and then yelled her name. Jamal came out of his room, ready to leave, and said, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to bother her over the air purifier. I\u2019m coming downstairs; I can turn it off.\u201d I wasn\u2019t asking about that, so I kept calling her and asked him to open her door. He retorted, \u201cWhat are you trying to pry her off her bed for? You don\u2019t need to bother her over every little thing.\u201d I told him I wanted to tell her something. He opened the door, then walked off. I asked if she was on her bed, and he said no. When I told him to walk inside, he said he had to \u201cbe somewhere\u201d (nowhere). I was upset since he knows I\u2019m trying to get her attention, but he does the bare minimum. I laid this out for him and called him weird for that. He cut me off, saying, \u201cDon\u2019t start this with me.\u201d I reiterated everything and insisted he was weird for not helping. He shot back, \u201cYou barely help me. You can\u2019t be bothered to throw a potato in the oven while I\u2019m outside helping our pregnant sister. How about that?\u201d I reiterated every issue of his while he walked off, telling me this was \u201cpetty and unnecessary\u201d before leaving. AITA  Edit: To clarify, I\u2019m describing how his actions make me feel. He has never outright called me fat; I just don\u2019t like watching him eat the way he does since it makes me feel bad.",

The problem starts in the pandemic when we both started to have serious issues with self-destructive behaviour.Since last year I have been improving greatly and I think I\u2019m finally healing, but my friend doesn\u2019t seem to want to get on the same path as me. I respect her choices but I really want to help her and it breaks my heart to see her like this, knowing that having her around always slows down my healing journey.Last month, she went on vacation and told me she ordered a package online and sent it to my house (without asking me) and I said it was fine. When it arrived, I stored it in a box under my bed. Some weeks pass, she comes back from her trip and messages me to hang out. She specifically asked me to bring the package, and I thought it was weird but didn\u2019t think too much of it. As I was packing some stuff to bring to her house, I opened the box under my bed and noticed the package wasn\u2019t there. My parents called me downstairs to talk and my dad told me he knew what was inside the package. It was something that could really harm her, and I had no idea. I explained the situation to my parents and thankfully they believed I had no idea about what was inside and I thought I was doing my friend a favour. I started to really think about it and I got really sad at the thought of having helped her smuggle the package behind her parents\u2019 backs. I asked my dad for the package and threw it in the trash before going to my friend\u2019s house. When I arrived, she asked me for the package and I told her what happened. She seemed angry at me and was really quiet through our hangout. I asked my mom to pick me up early, and when I got to my house today, she bombarded my phone with messages saying her package had costed her a lot money and demanded I pay her what she spent or buy her the exact same thing she had bought. I\u2019m not really in a good financial position because I\u2019m saving up for my own education\u2014her family is much richer than mine and her allowance is about three times more than mine\u2014and I didn\u2019t want to spend money only to buy her something dangerous behind her and my parents\u2019 backs. I refused to pay, but that only upset her more. Am I the asshole? ",

        "selftext": "Once I asked a friend to help me move and they said yes because they are compassionate and helpful. I told them I'd buy a pizza. I had already hired 2 guys and a truck to do the heavy lifting, just needed some extra hands. Then one of the guys quit while we were still packing up boxes with stuff. So i asked my friend if they could fill in and they said yes because they saw I was in need and they are compassionate and helpful. I offered to buy my friend some additional pizza.  After a few hours of heavy lifting (I assume, I had to pop out for a bit for band rehearsal) my friend asked if I could pay them what I was going to give to the guy who quit.  Unfortunately, I already gave that guy money, so I could only pay my friend about half that. Then the other guy with the truck quit and I told my friend just to cover for them until I found a new guy.  I told my friend I couldn't give them any additional money for helping, but I would pay them $1 for each box. They said ok because it wasn't really about the money, it was about helping.After we got the truck loaded, I paid them $1 for every box... after the first 100 boxes. I forgot to tell them that part. The lock on the truck was broken and I didn't want to pay to fix it, so I told my friend to sleep in the truck to keep it safe while we parked it on the Chicago streets until we could unload it in a couple days. They said ok, because they knew no one else would do it and they wanted to keep the boxes safe. When it was time to unload the truck, I had to let her get a head start without me (I had band practice again). They were responsible for bringing boxes up the stairs while I was responsible for telling them which room to put them in (though admittedly I did get distracted a few times, phones right?). Once we got it all unloaded, my friend was helping me unpack because they saw I needed the extra hands. I opened the box marked kitchen and discovered that one of my mugs wasn't in the kitchen box.  I asked my friend where the mug was. They said they weren't sure, maybe it was just forgotten in all the confusion and they could go back to the house to check or look in another box.  I fired them immediately and began telling their friends and coworkers, I don't know for sure that they didn't steal the mug.  So, am I the a-hole? Which is more likely- that my friend did all that work and still stole a mug? or that I gave them an impossible task without supporting her and one item in a sea of items was temporarily misplaced?",

We have been good friends but our communication is pretty ass on both of our parts.  Now we made plans to hang out at new years at his place, which for me is a good two hour trip and not that I mind the distance but I couldn\u2019t sleep over there cause his roommate would have friends over and they wouldn\u2019t have any space for me. And we couldnt spend it at mine since i would still be moving in and have nothing but a single person mattress and a lot of bags and boxes to get around. We planned this like a week ahead and I did say I might have to cancel later on while planning cause of my dad being in the hospital with a broken thumb and a harsh infection on the stitches. I also told him about my worry for the distance I\u2019d have to travel that late at night, but said I\u2019d let him know about it. Which I did four days prior that I wouldn\u2019t be able to make it due to the reasons I gave him before. I told him I was sorry and that I\u2019d make up for it soon. But all he did was sigh loudly and said \u201cokay, yeah sure.\u201d And before I could say anything else he hung up. He ghosted me for like a week and didnt even show up to the place where our friends meet up for a week and a half. Then he showed up like nothing happened until he asked to talk to me alone and continued to talk about how it was a asshole move to cancel on him like that and acted like I betrayed him last second.  Now I apologized again in that moment and then he said it\u2019s fine and that we could go back to being friends like we stopped because I cancelled.  So a few weeks ago, he invited me to go to this vintage market after college. To which I kind of said the same thing about having to see cause I was a little busy and starting a new therapy trial and could be tired at that time. That day came and I went home early after puking on an empty stomach and he called me the moment I was gonna text him and I told him first thing and he didn\u2019t even say anything before hanging up and ghosting me again and he hasn\u2019t texted me since. I haven\u2019t been at college since then and I follow my classes online cause I\u2019m still incredibly sick and I haven\u2019t been able to leave my house or move too much at all.  I\u2019ve been feeling guilty about it the entire time and I\u2019ve tried to apologize a lot of times through text but he just keeps ignoring me. I feel really shitty about cancelling him a bunch of times and I really don\u2019t know if it\u2019s my fault or not?  So AITA?",

We gave her until 8:00 PM to draft us a multi-week plan regarding how she plans to get a job (e.g. how many jobs a week? which jobs? etc.) She gave us a half-assed paper that said, apply to 3 jobs a week.

I'm a pretty heavy sleeper and therefore i did not notice them knocking on the door. They called me once and texted me once but i slept through that. Around 2 hours later, i finally awoken and saw their text. I immediately got up to unlock it and by that time they were hella fricking pissed. I see that I do sound like ah but its not like they were locked out of the apt. idk maybe im overthinking it and i am an ahole. ",

        "selftext": "My dad and I were fairly close even though he lived in another country apart from the rest of the family. He passed away a couple years ago, but there was no love between my parents since I was young - mostly due to the distance and the financial troubles we were in, she blamed him for the lack of support and I grew up hearing them fight constantly. It\u2019s a bit complicated but they remained married still until his passing.  My mom has been seeing this new guy for several years now, and I\u2019ve never met him (she has never asked but it\u2019s not something I would remotely be interested in - her life is her life). I also know they\u2019ve been on/off many times, despite also having gone on trips, etc.  Since it\u2019s my day I\u2019m uncomfortable with my mom bringing him as a +1. I understand that she wants to celebrate her daughter getting married, however there will also be family invited whom she\u2019ll likely need to act as translator for, since they do not speak English and are only flying in for my wedding.  Her argument is also that, since I\u2019m OK with her having invited coworkers and other less-close friends, that her (currently-on) boyfriend is no different and that I am selfish for not wanting him there when it\u2019s \u201cher day too\u201d.  So AITA for not wanting my mom to specifically bring her boyfriend to my wedding, when I\u2019m OK with coworkers/other people in her life?",

        "selftext": "My 18yo daughter lives at home - as she should since she is not at college or working in a full time job. She graduated high school in 2024 and has a part time job.  She does not drive. My husband and I drive her to work, to her community activities, to hang out with friends, and to dates. She recently asked if she could have 5 people over for her birthday and for a sleepover. We said no. We told our kids that parties are fine through their 18th birthday and for graduation but after that we only have family celebrations. Our reasons: It's a small place and we'd be on top of each other.  After working our jobs all week and juggling her and her brother's activities, we need some calm and quiet. Also, we don't know these kids.  Having them over for a couple of hours is something I can gear myself up for, but an open-ended time of strangers in my space... my heart is racing as I'm typing this.  It makes me super anxious. Daughter knows this (about the anxiety) but has been arguing that it's not a big deal, everyone else does it, and I never have people over.  She has had people over from time to time, but since she and her friends are all dependent on rides, it doesn't happen often. I floated the idea of a 2-3 hour hangout but since she argued with us for about 20 minutes, my husband is like 'nope. not gonna happen. I understand that she's disappointed and wants to hang out with her friends for her birthday. So, reddit, would I be the asshole for not hosting a party for my daughter's 19th birthday? UPDATE 9:55 pm. Some thought provoking questions in the comments. No sleepovers ever? Yes, from around 2nd grade to age 16 we hosted a couple every year - except during Covid, of course.  She hasn't been interested for a few years.  Why doesn't she drive? Lost her driver's license after causing 2 accidents in 3 months.  Thankfully, only damage from the accidents was to the cars; all people involved were fine. However, insurance dropped her and threatened to drop us if she didn't surrender her license. How are you  trying to help her? I've been trying to get her to try for her driver's license again but I'm meeting with resistance.  Talked about the pros and cons of several career opportunities but she doesn't want to have anything to do with it.  Going to counseling, but she seems to use it as a vent session - which can be helpful! - rather than taking the homework and following through with the counselor's advice. Honestly, I know that I need to step up here and take the lead.  Humans tend to do a much or as little as is expected of them; I need to help her raise her expectations. Why isn't she in college? She's not interested in post secondary education right now. She may go back later, and I'm fine with that.  Why doesn't she have a full time job? She doesn't know what she wants to do.  She's currently refusing to look for a full time and I'm not willing to kick her out.  I know a lot of folks do that to their kid when they become an adult, but I don't want to.  I love her and like having her around, knowing she's safe.  Honestly, as a parent I am struggling with how to help her without pushing her away.  ",

When I told Stephanie that Mikey was coming, she didn't say anything to me, but later called Hannah and asked if Hannah could find another option for Mikey. Stephanie said it's ok if he has to come but it's not a party for kids.  Hannah called me very upset that her son isn't wanted at the party, so I called Stephanie and told her she's being rude, needs to respect her family more, needs to apologize to Hannah, and should be happy Mikey is coming. She told me that this was between her and Hannah and that I should stay out of it. I said that I'm planning the party, so I don't have to stay out of it (I stayed out of it when Stephanie didn't invite all of her aunts/uncles to her wedding but I'm not staying out of this). She replied that she'd plan the party herself and uninvited me.  I'm just trying to help my daughters resolve their fight and plan a nice party. AITA?",

        "selftext": "Hi so currently I\u2019m in a situation and I\u2019d like an outside perspective as my family think I\u2019m an asshole!! Sorry in advance if there is any spelling mistakes and punctuation errors, I\u2019m typing this fast as my wife is getting our daughter ready for bed. So I Adam (19M) is married to Keeley (19F) and between us we have a little girl Iris (3F) turning 4 in a few weeks. Keeley and I got married last year after being together for 6 almost 7 years - we got together at 13 and we have been friends since the age of 10 . During our entire friendship and beginning of our relationship Keeley had no minim/ non existent relationship with her dad - he pretty much abandoned her and her siblings and from what she\u2019s told me over the years, he was an absent father throughout her entire childhood. Keeley\u2019s mum met her step dad when Keeley was around 6, and from then on her dad became even more absent and when he would have her and the siblings, she would be the one looking after everyone when only being the middle child. During last year\u2019s wedding preparations Keeley\u2019s dad wanted to walk her down the aisle on her wedding day. I didn\u2019t see the problem with that but Keeley was set in her ways and told me and her entire extended family that her step dad was going to walk her down the aisle and if anyone had a problem with it they would have been uninvited to the wedding. Fast forward to now, I\u2019ve been meeting with her dad, we will call him Ben (46M) every couple of weeks to catch up and update him on how iris and Keeley is getting along ( iris is in nursing and Keeley is going to uni in September to be a nurse). This week when I met up with Ben he expressed a desire to get to know his granddaughter as he said \u201che doesn\u2019t know how long he\u2019s got left) let me preface this by saying Ben has tried to use this tactic over the last to get Keeley to talk to him and as Keeley told me he used this as an excuse when she was kid, when she wouldn\u2019t do something he wanted.. but I don\u2019t know if he is being honest or if he is actually gonna die soon. I guess I want Keeley to talk to her dad, as I didn\u2019t have a dad growing up, my dad died when I was 9 years old - that\u2019s the reason we moved and then that\u2019s when I met Keeley. He wants me to bring iris to our meet ups or ask Keeley to hear him out. After the conversation I went to my mums house to ask for advice and she said i definitely shouldn\u2019t bring up this up to keeley and to stop meeting up with ben. I\u2019m considering just telling keeley everything and dealing with the fall out afterwards.So Reddit, Would I be the asshole if I asked my wife to talk to her dad? I don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t think of this but this is the only relationship I\u2019ve ever been in and I\u2019m actually super close to her step dad.  Edit - hello everyone! I just want to say thank you for all the comments and messages I\u2019ve received. Firstly, I wanna address people this story and account fake - I can assure you it is not, this is my real life and the account is a burner account as I do have a normal Reddit account and I have done since I was 15 Keeley just follows that one so I had to make a new one to address this matter. Secondly, people saying my story doesn\u2019t match up with our ages, we had our daughter at 16, which is almost 4 years ago, I turn 20 on the 16th January and then iris turns 4 on the 25 of February and then the following month Keeley turns 20. Keeley is starting uni in September as she took some time out of education to be 100% present for iris first 9 months that\u2019s the reason she is going. Also when I say iris is in nursery, I mean it\u2019s like a play group thing she goes to everyday, my mother in law takes her for a few hours while I\u2019m at work and my wife is at college. I just also wanna preface this by saying No, iris was never planned, we never planned to have kids till at least our twenty\u2019s, but when we found out Keeley was pregnant we had a long talk and decided that we both could do it and she\u2019s an amazing mum. In the last 3 years Ben has had nothing to do with Iris - as some messages were saying - and it wasn\u2019t due to my wife\u2019s lack of trying, he didn\u2019t want have that relationship with her. Lastly, after reading through all you\u2019re comments I can clearly tell I\u2019m a huge arsehole, Keeley has no idea I\u2019ve been meeting with her father and as some of you have said it\u2019s a huge breach of trust which is completely is. A lot of you are saying that he is using the situation with my dad against me and I never thought of this until it was mentioned. When thinking back to our meetings I can definitely say this is the case, him bringing up how, he thinks that my relationship with my dad would be now or how my own fathers relationship with my daughter would be. The people saying that this is a reason for Keeley to leave/ divorce me is a bit far fetch, Keeley is an understanding woman and she would never do something like that unless it was absolutely necessary. I\u2019m writing this on the way to wok. Tonight when I get him I\u2019m gonna to show Keeley this post, comments and all the messages I\u2019ve received and we shall go from there. I wanna say thank you to everyone who took the time to read this post, even tho I\u2019m a hide asshole. ",

We had a teenage romance in early high school that eventually became an on-again-off-again thing in our twenties before finally completely dissolving at around my thirtieth birthday.  We did briefly get married shortly after college graduation so that she could get on my health insurance, but we were living separately at the time and even dating other people.  Because we've known each other for so long, we'll still get coffee or talk over Zoom 4-5x a year to catch up, but the romantic part of our relationship has been completely buried for close to over a decade. And when I say buried, I mean completely gone. Not even a little spark. We've lived across the country from eachother for about five years now. The meetups are mostly talking about life and work shit and the occasional reminiscing. I'm reluctant to give them up because, gloomily enough, Mandy and I are the only two people from our original friend group that are either still living or talking to eachother. I've been with my current wife (38F, Sam) for around six years. She knows about my conversations with Mandy, and she's given her approval, but I can tell the approval has been given reluctantly.

        "selftext": "I was recently out late night to party with my friends. We found this fancy pub which attracts a lot of tourists - I\u2019m not one as I\u2019ve been in this country for more than a year now. I\u2019m an expat, Asian (brown). We decided to enter the pub. The bouncer was standing right in front of the entrance. I saw him and made a small head nod with a smile proceeding to walk past (which I do usually with no issues at all, kinda always felt like a bar/pub code) while he was parallely saying something to me in the local language which I don\u2019t speak. Note - he didn\u2019t block the way by any means or hand gestures or there was no queue. In a second, I was aggressively pulled from behind, he snatched my backup and shouted with anger along the lines of \u201cYOU DON\u2019T WALK BY WHEN I\u2019M TALKING, YOU DISRESPECTED ME, THIS IS MY PLACE AND YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED\u201d. I was shook by this manhandling incident and apologised to him that I didn\u2019t understand the language and not meant to disrespect him by any means. He furiously said, it doesn\u2019t matter and I\u2019m denied access. I apologised and returned. Firstly, it\u2019s not a local pub, the name is evidently common across many countries and it attracts tourists - why communicate in a local language? Second, even if that was a miss from my side to not attempt to understand what he was saying or informing him I don\u2019t speak the language, was his behaviour justified or AITA? Note - I was not super drunk or unstable or alarming by any chance, also had a decent outfit for a pub and was let in with a smile by the other bouncer in a different pub. Edit - I went through the reviews of this pub in internet and the bouncers are known for their notorious racial discriminations so it\u2019s not a me issue. But nevertheless I will not play the racist card here, because I did misunderstand his communication as an invitation/greeting due to my lack of attention/language barrier. I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019d have got a different treatment if was not brown after reading the reviews.",

        "selftext": "Throwaway account for obvious reasons I (F30) got married a few years ago, and for my wedding, I gave my sister, **Victoria** (F28), enough tickets to invite whomever she wanted no questions asked. The only condition was that she not invite one specific person my fiance really disliked. She understood, and it wasn\u2019t an issue since, although they were friends, she respected our wishes. Now, Victoria is getting married. Weddings in our culture are a *big* deal, huge family gatherings filled with food, music, and dancing, where extended relatives, family friends, and even distant acquaintances are often invited. It\u2019s not uncommon to have hundreds of guests, and the celebration is as much about community as it is about the couple. Victoria hasn\u2019t really asked me for input on the guest list, which I understand, she already knows who she wants there. The wedding is still 9 months away, and I\u2019ve only asked her to invite **one** person. Just one. That person is **Alice**, who is incredibly important to me, like a sister. I\u2019ve known her since i was 10, and she even invited Victoria to her own wedding. However, when I brought it up, Victoria told me she hadn\u2019t invited Alice and wasn\u2019t planning to, not because she dislikes her, but because she\u2019s already over her guest limit. She told me to \u201cwait and see\u201d if there\u2019s space later. Her reasoning is that she hasn\u2019t seen Alice in years and that Alice doesn\u2019t know her fiance, so she\u2019s not on the priority list. But what frustrates me even more is that Victoria keeps saying that it shouldn\u2019t matter because she has already invited some of my friends. While that is *partially* true, the reality is that those friends are also *her* friends, she invited them because she wanted them there, not because I asked her to. I even pointed this out and said, \u201cWell, if that\u2019s the case, then how about we swap out a third friend for Alice?\u201d Her immediate response was *no,* because that person is \u201cher guest\u201d and is definitely coming. I know it\u2019s not my wedding, it\u2019s Victoria\u2019s and her fiance\u2019s decision who they invite. I completely respect that. I\u2019m not angry or trying to demand anything, I just can\u2019t help but feel a little disappointed. With so many people being invite, it stings that Alice, who is like family to me, couldn\u2019t be included. Especially when I made accommodations for Victoria at my own wedding **AITA for insisting she make room for Alice?** EDIT: Since people keep saying. Alice has been a close family friend for 20 years. She and Vic even hung out without me many times so they are not randoms. EDIT 2: Maybe using insist was the incorrect term since everyone keeps pointing that out. We only had 1 conversation about this where I said Id like to have Alice in the guest list and she said no, then we talked about it for 5 more minutes before it ended and I asked her to let me know if she changed her mind. Edit 3: I should have mentioned that we are NOT American. In our culture its very normal that parents and siblings get to invite their friends to the wedding and you are usually sat with your guests during the banquet so its not that weird that I asked about a specific friend.

        "selftext": "So basically 2023 was a really tough time for me emotionally speaking. My grandpa's brother, who we often visited and had great conversations, died in January. That was a really big factor of my mental state, but there were other factors as well. To summarize, my grades were really bad and I was extremely sad and hopeless for the longest continuous period of time in my life, ever.  So, I decided, for some reason, that I'll talk about my problems in the class group chat. The response was immediately dismissive. The crux was that I didn't know what exactly is the problem, I just knew something is very much off. So my classmates were like Why are you talking about your problems if you don't even know what they are? We can't help you if we don't know what you need help with.    In my messages I would describe myself as having a breakdown/tantrum. And I just want to say, I am aware that just because I was in a tough mental state it doesn't mean I'm allowed to drag my classmates into it and do whatever I want. But overall, this has been on my mind a lot since it has happened, and I just want to know what others think. From both sides of the fence.  Thank you!",

        "selftext": "Hey all,I was in a bar last week and I was having a good time with a friend. A lot of people interacted with us and we were all having a good time.  There was a moment where a few girls asked if they could sit with us. For context we were are both males. I did not really talk to their group, other than saying hi, and I was speaking to another girl about university and the states. One of the girls from the group, was flirting with my friend I believe and earlier when they first sat down, my friend asked her what she thought of Australia day, and she said Invasion Day... my parents invaded. I understood the banter, but didn't mess with that, so already knew to not engage with them and avoid them. At a certain point I was just sitting with the one girl from the group and myself, as my friend and her's went to get drinks seperately. We started talking about skincare as she saw my lip balm on the table and made a lewd comment about me having it. I told her so you like my friend and she said yeah but was saying what he was wearing wasn't nice. I asked her if she had a boyfriend and she said she was dating a guy, and I asked if her friends had boyfriends and she said yes, and I said oh it's probably best you don't sit with us, but I hope he pleases you (meant it as treats you well, BUT that is a bit weird to say) you and everything goes well. She took offence and said these aren't your seats and said a few rude things I can't remmeber, I said yes but we were here first this is our land, so you can piss off basically taking a dig at what she said before. About 20 minutes later, a member of staff came to me and pulled me aside. They explained I was reported as making an inappropriate comment to a few females and I had to leave. I was taken aback but said yeah of course, because I know better than to argue as it's a strict policy that bars need to enforce. When I was being escorted out I did explain there was a girl I told to girl to kick rocks when I found out she had a boyfriend, although I had been interacting with men/women all night and nobody had complained. I was pretty much sober as I don't like to drink much. The staff that escorted me out apologised and said they felt uncomfortable doing that to me, and I said that they were being professional and it's fine. They said they would love to have me back but as a hard  policy, any complaint is taken seriously. We exchanged names and that was it. I am 99% sure this was why I was kicked out. Whether something was taken out of context is understandable, and to be honest I should have known better to be rude. AITA for telling someone to piss off and getting kicked out, of was this blown out of proportion?",

        "selftext": "  AITA for refusing to tell my friend where I got my bag? So, this might sound silly, but it\u2019s been bothering me, and I need some outside opinions. I (let\u2019s say 25M) recently bought a new bag. It\u2019s a really nice bag\u2014well-designed, stylish, and super affordable compared to the market price. I love it, and I think I got a great deal. A few days ago, my friend (also 25M) saw me with the bag and complimented it, asking where I got it. I just laughed and said, \u201cIt\u2019s a secret.\u201d He jokingly replied, \u201cDid you get it off the black market or something?\u201d I shrugged it off but told him, \u201cDo I look like someone who buys from the black market?\u201d He seemed to notice the convo was going nowhere, so he changed the subject. The next day, he brought it up again, saying he wanted a similar bag but in a different style and asked where he could find one. At that point, I told him, \u201cSince you\u2019re persistent, I\u2019ll guide you to somewhere you might find something similar, but I really don\u2019t like sharing my sources\u2014so don\u2019t ask why. I have my reasons.\u201d Now, here\u2019s the thing\u2014this friend has always been supportive of me and has dedicated a lot of energy and time to help me in life. But I just don\u2019t like sharing where I buy my things. It\u2019s just a personal thing. He seemed kind of annoyed but didn\u2019t push further.

He were working overtime, but it wasn't enough, and I couldn't find a job that paid enough to help. We didn't have family to bail us out, so I was desperate. had already talked with my bf about if I should but I made it seem like a joke. He told me flat out he didn't want me doing that and was super stern about it. So when I did start selling I didn't tel my boyfriend because I knew he wouldn't be okay with it. But I didn't see another way to keep us from getting kicked out. For a few months, I told him my aunt sent me money to help with rent. He believed it and was really happy but last night he went through my phone and found out. We've been arguing about it all day and I feel terrible. He got really mad and said I betrayed his trust. He said I should've talked to him instead of doing it behind his back but if I talked to him he wouldve never let me. I get why he's upset, but I feel like I didn't have a choice. I don't make a crazy amount of money but it's just enough so we van afford our expenses. He said he wants me to stop posting but 1 think should keep posting until were at a better spot. 1 wasn't trying to hurt him or be sneaky I just didn't know what else to do. I know it wasn't the best move, but I didn't know what else to do since we were stuck. Was I wrong to do it behind his back, or was it kind of justified because of the situation?",

        "selftext": "So me (18M) and my girlfriend (18F) has been together a just over a year now, and we both have eachothers phone passcodes. Early on in the relationship I've established that I don't agree with obsessing with celebrities or saving videos of someone you find attractive on social media if you have a partner - she agreed and didn't have a problem with this. A couple times however I've found her doing this. One time she thought I was asleep, she was on her phone and I saw she had a bunch of thirst traps saved (all of the same actor). When I pretended to wake up she deleted them as quick as she could which I found very odd, because now it seems she's trying to hide it. That was half a year ago, but yesterday whilst she was sleeping, I went on her Tiktok. Initially I went on it to troll a mutual friend of ours, I was going to send them a silly message but then I saw that my girlfriend had been sending this friend thirst traps of that same actor from before saying things like Silent repost because my boyfriend would be upset or I fear I would fall for this man but don't tell my boyfriend I said that. I felt so disrespected because she's actively trying to hide it, and this is something she KNEW I would be upset by. Anyways, I then went through her favourited videos and as I thought, a bunch of thirst traps and edits of the same guy over and over again. I know people are going to say You violated her privacy, you clearly didn't trust her in the first place but we've given eachother our passcodes so I don't think it's that problematic, she could've gone through my phone too. Let me know if that's a wrong way of thinking. I confronted her and she smiled and laughed and said you've made yourself sad now why would you do that. She saw I wasn't happy and changed her demeanor, and said she didn't know what to say. We talked and I said how I felt betrayed, she crossed a boundary and how I thought it was disgusting that she was fully aware she was doing something I wasn't comfortable with and tried to hide it. We didn't get into an argument, we were laying in bed saying things individually, taking long pauses to think of what to say, no shouting just calm discussion. When she got home, her parents asked why she was upset and she told them the situation but her parents are very angry at me for going through her phone in the first place, and said that I didn't trust her. She also texted me saying she also thought the same thing but didn't want to tell me when we were hanging out because she didn't want to make the situation worse. I haven't told her I wasn't even planning on going through her phone in the first place but rather just wanted to troll that friend of ours. I know that I should've just left it at that and ignored the videos she sent, rather than going through her favourites. I just want opinions on the situation, am I the asshole for having gone through her phone, or am I right in saying she's in the wrong for having crossed a boundary?",

The thing is, my friend saw it (way deep into other old stories) and shared it with me, saying: \u201cI look really fat, like a pig. Delete it.\u201d She always says something along those lines, even though she\u2019s nowhere near fat, and in that picture she looked normal. Had she looked ugly I would\u2019ve deleted it no questions asked, but it was a cute picture with other friends that I don\u2019t even see that much. It was a fun memory. So we fought, her saying she looked bad, me saying no one looks at my stories anyway (I have few followers), and most importantly, deleting it felt like accepting her delusion and harmful comments about her body. She then threatened to share ugly photos of me (that I honestly don\u2019t care about) and report the story. I said go ahead. Anyway, after a long fight, I gave in. I know that her high school friends were obsessed with being skinny and laughed at fat girls (what the fuck), so I know it\u2019s a sensitive issue for her (even though she doesn\u2019t realize it). I deleted the story, but I still think I shouldn\u2019t have. Am I the asshole? ",

        "selftext": "So, a little context: I (35M) am getting married to my fianc\u00e9, Audrey (29F), in a few months. My brother, Steve (30M), has been dating his girlfriend, Lisa (28F), for about a year now. I\u2019ve never really clicked with Lisa, but we\u2019ve always been cordial. She\u2019s kind of loud and opinionated. She also has a tendency to interrupt people when they\u2019re talking, and it drives me nuts. Here\u2019s where it gets tricky. A few weeks ago, my mom mentioned that I \u201creally should\u201d invite Lisa to the wedding, even though I didn\u2019t initially plan to. I told my mom that I was keeping the guest list tight, and that it was more about the vibe of the event. I didn\u2019t think it would be an issue since Lisa and I aren\u2019t close. But my mom started pushing, saying that if I didn\u2019t invite Lisa, it would be \u201csuper awkward\u201d for Steve and that \u201cfamily is important.\u201d I still didn\u2019t budge, and my mom seemed to accept it. However, I was talking to Steve yesterday, and he brought up the wedding. He casually mentioned that Lisa was upset she wasn\u2019t invited, and that it was \u201cweird\u201d that she was left out when she\u2019s been dating him for a year. He said that it would mean a lot to him if I reconsidered. I told him I didn\u2019t want to cause drama, but I just didn\u2019t feel comfortable inviting someone I don\u2019t get along with to my wedding. He got kind of quiet and then said, \u201cI guess I\u2019ll just skip the wedding, then,\u201d and walked off. Now, I\u2019m feeling conflicted. I don\u2019t want to lose my brother over this, but I also don\u2019t think it\u2019s my responsibility to make space for someone who isn\u2019t really part of my life, especially on such a personal day.",

        "selftext": "My partner and I live with her mom. She is very gracious in allowing us to live there so we can save money and buy a house. There is however, one complication. We have two cats, and when we moved in we asked that she gets rid of the toxic plants (she had a lot of lillies). Since we moved in two months ago, she has twice brought lillies home. Both times, we just said hey these are lillies can we move them, and she has no problem with that. Another time, she brought home a plant that was toxic, but I can't remember the name and it was shortly after she brought lillies home for the second time. A few days ago, she brought home a new plant that her friend gave her. I assumed that she had already checked the plant to see if it were toxic or not. Today, I looked it up myself and sure enough, its toxic to cats. When I approached her about the plant, I was respectful and just asked something like could you please check to see if the plants are toxic before you bring them in. Her response was saying that she felt attacked, that she didn't do anything wrong, and that because I helped unload her car, I should have seen the plant and looked it up then. (I didn't unload the plant from the car, just her heavy groceries from the trunk). We ended up getting in a heated argument. She was adamant that she did nothing wrong and that its my responsibility to look up the plants she brings in. I don't necessarily disagree, they are my cats and it is my responsibility...and I do look up all the plants she brings in. But after today being the third or fourth time she brought a toxic plant in...I just felt its not unreasonable to ask if she could look it up before hand. AITA? She does have obsessive personality disorder, so maybe her behavior has something to do with that? Or, maybe I'm just an asshole. Edit:  I should make it clear that\u2019s she is not a plant person. She only has like two plants in her house at any given time. She has one on the kitchen window sill( the one her friend gave her), and a bouquet of flowers on the kitchen island. She usually only has the flowers and changes them once a month",

        "selftext": "My BIL (28M) used to live with his parents, paying \u00a330 a week for rent and food. About 18 months ago, he started spending more time at our place after his parents\u2019 dog turned on him. I offered him to move in with us so he could save enough to move out. My husband wasn\u2019t thrilled about the idea, but I thought it would only be for a few months. EDIT we made the decision together, i didn't go against my husband's wishes we didn\u2019t have a spare room, so set him up in our 11y/o son\u2019s room with a foldout bed. We agreed on \u00a3160 a month, which covered bills/food. However he quickly started complaining about doing the dishes (only chore we asked him to do) and spent his money on nights out and other stuff instead of saving to move out. After a few months, it was clear he wasn't saving at all. When brought up, my husband said BIL had until March to move out, he was shocked by the deadline. We offered until end of August, with rent increased to \u00a3250 a month, which he agreed to. But he would consistently ignore basic requests: keeping the bathroom window open when showering to avoid mould, picking up his dirty clothes, keeping his stuff in our son's room organised and not sleeping in the living room overnight, we spend 80% of our time in that room, it's a family room NOT a bedroom. By august, BIL is no closer to moving out which i KNEW would happen. Instead, he booked a holiday, started saving for that, showing he can save and taking us for complete mugs. Rent went to \u00a3400 a month, hoping that would encourage him to leave because we can't just throw him out. He viewed a place, it fell through, and he blamed his friend- told us WE should be having a go at his friend instead as if WE'RE responsible for him. He\u2019s now been living with us nearly 18 months, paying low rent considering everything is included (even toiletries as he has not bought any since moving in). He works full-time and makes above minimum wage. I no longer like being around him, i find him rude, entitled and arrogant. The tension has caused strain between me and my husband, I\u2019ve tried to talk to him about it (A LOT), but he doesn\u2019t want to aggravate the situation, even though he agrees with me. I\u2019m frustrated because every time i broach the subject i feel dismissed and i just need to put up with it until he moves out, even if it means letting BIL act/talk to me in a disrespectful manner. My husband isn't afraid of confrontation but can't be bothered with it as we're stuck with him in house. As he doesn't back me up BIL doesn't take me seriously and i feel like I\u2019m not being supported in my own home. He's had enough of me going on about it, I've had enough of dealing with the whole thing. BIL is due to move out in 4 weeks-he's moving into his friend's (+ friends gf and 4 kids) attic as he never looked for anywhere, the whole situation has left me emotionally drained. I\u2019m wondering if I\u2019m overreacting or if my feelings are justified. Our friends agree BIL is miserable to be around and I\u2019m tired of the cr*p i'm putting up with, should i continue to let it go over my head?",

        "selftext": "So, this just happened, bear with me while I collect my thoughts.  Today my mother recieved a message from her step nephew. Her brother, my uncle, married a woman who already had 2 kids. He cared for them as if they were his own and we've always been close, even though they live in another country.  The message read something along the lines of Tell your family never to speak to my mother again. You should be ashamed of yourselves. Tell your parents their son would be ashamed of them. We were so confused. For context, we are currently on vacation that my grandparents paid for. Just immediate family, my grandparents, my parents, my brother, my husband, me and my son.  My uncle passed away a few years ago and since then, my mother communicates regularly with my aunt. We face timed her for Christmas. Up until that message, we had no indication anything was wrong. Now my aunt won't answer her calls and her step nephew is refusing to elaborate. Here comes the part where I might become an asshole. My mom has asked us not to tell my grandparents. My dad, brother and husband all know. I know because I was there when my mom got the message. I told my husband and my mom told my dad and my brother.  I think my grandparents deserve to know. I think they could shed light on what happened. My nana talks to my aunt all the time, so maybe something happened? They are napping right now, so it will be a little while before I have the opportunity.  We have speculated on causes but we really have no clue.  So, WIBTA if I went against my mom's wishes and told my grandparents about the message? Update: I spoke to my mom again. All of that side of the family has blocked her on all social media. They have not blocked anyone else, at least as far as I know. My aunt has not blocked or unfriended me, nor has her daughter or granddaughter. I hadn't noticed (I'm not on Facebook much) but the one who sent the message, his wife unfriended me at some point. No idea when. We still don't have an explanation, but I thought you guys might like an update. I haven't told my grandparents, as the consensus seems to be that it's up to my mom. And I get that. For now, as long as she promises to tell them eventually, I'll hold my tongue. Update 2: My mom told my grandparents. They are as confused as we are. They haven't spoken to anyone on that side since about a week before our trip. And it turns out my grandparents were about to send a big cheque. My grandfather has said he won't send the cheque until we get this sorted. My nana is annoyed that they used her son against her for what she perceives as no reason. I think I need to add the context that we live in Canada and they live in the US. And the message came on the day Trump instituted those tariffs. We've always had a difference of politics (they love Trump for some reason) but we almost never talk politics with them. My grandfather thinks they will come around once they realize the money has dried up. Also, they were supposed to send my nana part of my uncle's ashes and they never have. She deserves to have her sons ashes. All of this came out as my nana muttered angrily.",

        "selftext": "I (31f) recently drifted away from a friend (25f). I thought this happened naturally, (not hanging out as much / not talking over instagram etc.) but she felt hurt by the distance. We \u201cbroke up\u201d over text after the she sent l an incredibly long \u201cwhat did I do?\u201d to which I responded in summary \u201cnothing really, I feel like we\u2019re just in different parts of life. I wish you the best though!\u201d I realize now this text was the opportunity she wanted to launch into a diatribe of all the things I did wrong in the relationship and that she felt offended by. I had NO idea. One of these things was a miscommunication about driving to the airport. (A year and a half ago!) She messaged me in August 2023 about driving her to the airport at 6 in September. I said sure, even though this is something that I would not normally ask of a friend (I would ask my mom for or get an uber. Gas is expensive!) but I thought \u201cwell, she doesn\u2019t have a lot of family here\u201d so I said sure, you can get me a coffee and we\u2019ll call it even. I\u2019m a morning person so I figured she was asking me to drive her at 6 am. If I had known she meant 6pm I would have not agreed in the first place.  So flight day arrives and I roll up to her place at 6. I call her. Dial tone. Finally I get a hold of her and she says that the flight was at 6pm. We both apologized for the misunderstanding. I go back home to bed. I get up for work and am feeling (understandably?) tired and a bit grumpy. I send her a text saying \u201chey, I\u2019m not upset at you, but I am a bit grumpy about this miscommunication and am going to have to politely decline to drive you at 6pm tonight to rest\u201d I gave her notice and she replied \u201ctotally fair, I\u2019m so sorry for the mix up!\u201d and she sent me a starbucks giftcard for my trouble, which was a sweet but totally unnecessary gesture. She got to the airport, I wished her a nice vacation, and we caught up when she got back. I thought all was well.  Folks, all was not well. She had apparently held on to this resentment as \u201cI broke a promise\u201d to her. She said me cancelling was selfish cause she couldn\u2019t afford an uber and was shocked that I didn\u2019t rearrange my schedule to drive her at 6pm. She apparently had to take a bus and then get another friend to drive her \u201cwho dropped everything for her\u201d. She was flabbergasted that she \u201csent me the giftcard and then I cancelled! WHO DOES THAT?!\u201d Apparently I didn\u2019t prioritize her and didn\u2019t care about her feelings and wellbeing as I knew how much this trip meant to her. I looked back and she sent me the giftcard after I declined to drive her. I thought it was a nice gesture at the time, but now I feel like she felt like I owed it to her to say \u201caww, since you got me coffee I WILL drive you now\u201d. I thought this was a simple favour that I could revoke cause circumstances changed and not \u201ca promise\u201d. I am doubly confused cause she said over text that it was fine at the time. Am I the asshole for not realizing this was a dealbreaker? ",

These porcelain dolls were around when I was a child and I had memories of getting in trouble for playing with them. They were absolutely beautiful. Well, when my mother died I (29F) decided to keep ONE doll, I know it wasn\u2019t left to me, but I felt like they meant more to me than they could to my niece. I contemplated giving it back to her when she was old enough to appreciate it. We\u2019re from Louisiana and hurricane Laura hit \u2026 when we evacuated. I took the doll with me because I knew it was sentimental and irreplaceable. My niece, however let all of the remaining five dolls get ruined in hurricane because she let them in the house when where got ruined. My twin sister (Jays mom) thanks that it\u2019s only fair that I give Jay the doll. I kept safe because after all it was left for her\u2026. My argument is that if I would have gave her the doll, it would have gotten ruined with the other ones because she didn\u2019t care enough about them to take them her with her. Fast-forward, we are now in 2025 and I have a daughter of my own. I 100 % believe if my mom would have known she was gonna have another granddaughter she would have left a doll to her. AITA? ",

        "selftext": "My (26F) parents own the 2-bedroom condo I live in, and my boyfriend (28M) moved in a few months ago. We discussed rent beforehand, and he was fine with paying. I initially told him $1800,  in addition to splitting utilities 50/50. He agreed. For context, comparable 2-bedroom condos in our area (a desirable part of Southern California) rent for around $2800, meaning $1400 per person. My parents aren't charging *me* rent, which is incredibly generous. However, they see the condo as an investment property, and the rent they would charge me is factored into their financial planning. I send them a portion of the rent I collect every month. I also pay the HOA dues and property taxes (which are substantial in California). Everything was fine for a few months. Then, my boyfriend was looking at rental listings and realized that *individual* rooms in comparable condos are going for around $1400. He also found out (from me, I wasn't hiding it) that I technically don't pay rent myself since my parents own the place. He completely flipped out. He accused me of trying to profit off him, saying I'm taking advantage of him because I'm not paying rent. He argues that since I don't have a rent payment, the $1800 is mostly profit for me. He thinks he should only pay half of what *I* pay in combined HOA dues, property taxes and utilities. I admitted that the $1800 wasn't just based on splitting a theoretical $2800 rent. I told him I added a bit extra because I'm the one paying the HOA fees and property taxes, and I\u2019ve been responsible for general upkeep of the place. I also have to send a portion of the rent money to my parents. I acknowledged that it's more than half of what a comparable room would cost. He's not having it. He keeps saying I'm ripping him off and that I should only charge him half the combined HOA, taxes, and utilities. He\u2019s now refusing to pay the agreed-upon $1800 and is only offering what he calculates as his share of the combined HOA, taxes, and utilities. I feel like I'm being reasonable. I'm not trying to get rich off him. I'm just trying to cover the actual expenses associated with the condo. Am I the asshole here? Should I just lower the rent to appease him, even though I feel like I'm not doing anything wrong? This is making things incredibly awkward. EDIT: There is no mortgage. My parents bought the place cash as investment property. I have been living here rent free for about 8 years and have done some remodeling at the time, and have had friends as roommates here and there whom i also charged rent, but usually those cases were when those friends were suffering financially so they paid under market value.  My parents did not ask me to charge my boyfriend rent or for me to send them money, they basically say it's my choice to use the place as I want for now.  I send them 1k a month because technically it is their place and so I feel they should get a share of the rent. EDIT - UPDATE   For everyone assuming/asking if I am pocketing the money. NO I AM NOT.  It;s like this:  I send 1k to my parents since it's their place, and every time I've had a roommate I've sent them a portion of the rent without them having to ask. BECAUSE they bought this place as an investment property. I was originally going to fic it up and rent it out but stayed longer than I planned and they have never charged me rent. So I am holding them back from it being a full time rental property so of my own initiative I am sending them rent whenever I have roommates before they can ask me for it.  1k to parents $500 - HOA dues  $100-150/mo utilities Property taxes - somwehere between 5-10k/year So I'm usually left with $150-200 every month after paying my parents and HOA and utilities, and even combined over a year it would still not cover even half the property taxes, which I am willing to keep covering fully myself.   I am not pocketing anything or making any money from what I charge my boyfriend for rent. ",

        "selftext": "I 40f and my husband 42m have two wonderful kids 10m and 7f.  Our kids have never been the best of friends or even got along that well most the time, they would bicker and argue with each other call each other names and do things they knew annoyed the other to purposefully get under their skin.  I don't want to go in to detail but we've had some financial issues lately that caused a bit of a strain on our marriage, we would argue a lot late at night when the kids were in bed and often wouldn't go to bed ourselves until 2 or 3 :am ( even when we had work the next day).  I'm ashamed to say that it turns out our kids would often wake up and hear our late night arguments and this actually gave our daughter nightmares, I found this out when I went to wake my son and saw his sister in bed with him, that's when he told me she had a nightmare and got in bed with him because my husband and were still up fighting.  This broke my heart to know we made our daughter scared and weren't  there to comfort her,  we made sure to keep our arguments as quiet as possible and reasured our daughter that sometimes mommy and daddy fight but she didn't need to worry about that and everything would be okay.  We kept our arguments to a minimum and were as quiet as possible, but our daughter still had nightmares the next few nights and got in bed with her brother.  We were able to get a handle on our financial issues and stop fighting so much. We reassured the kids that  everything would be okay and that they didn't have to worry. After a few nights our daughter was back to sleeping in her owne bed.  Ever since then our kids have gotten much closer, they play together, watch shows together, goof around together, and treat each other with much more love and respect then they used to. They even hug each other goodnight every night.  They still have arguments and bicker but it's much less and they  have an overall very loving relationship.  Today my daughter drew her brother a picture of the two of them playing in our yard with the words  best big brother in the world written really big on top.  My son loved it and showed it to us and asked if we could have it framed, as I mentioned we have been having financial issues lately and I really don't think we could afford to frame it.  I told him he didn't need to frame it, he could just hang it up on the wall. But he said he wanted to frame it because special pictures get framed and this is the most special picture he has. I tried to tell him gently that we can't afford to frame it but he and his sister are still upset.  I asked my husband about it and he said maybe we should get it framed because it's so special to our son and there new found closeness could maybe be hurt by us refusing to frame it.  The last thing I want to do is hurt there new close relationship but I still don't think we can afford to get it framed.  AITA? Edit: We went to Walmart and got our son a frame for his sister's picture, we put it up on his wall right across from where his bed is and he absolutely loves it!  We're very glad his relationship with his sister is so much better and seeing her picture for him everyday means so much to him. We're so glad we were able to get a frame for him.  Some of you seemed to get the idea we were just cheap or that we just didn't want to spend money on the kids, that's absolutely not the case. The kids have lots of toys, their owne bikes and phones and of course all the essentials.  My husband and i didn't realize that there were options for cheap picture frames but we were delighted to find out there were.  Thank you all! ",

        "selftext": "Hello everyone! Just made an account, so bear with me while I try and type this out well! *Fake Names* My best friend Macy (19) and Me ( 22 ) have been best friends for 11 years. We\u2019ve been a very close pair and never had arguments. I watched her grow up while I grew up as well. She\u2019s always been like a sister to me. I\u2019ve been there whenever she needed me as she was also there for me. A few years back she had moved to Maine with her family and it absolutely devastated us. We would hang out on week days and every weekend together and now having that divide was crushing. We still kept in touch and stayed close, communication just got harder as years went on. She has recently graduated, started college and a job. I am so proud of her for all her achievements, she is one of the smartest people I know. A few months ago she got engaged to her 6 year long relationship with her boyfriend Rob ( 20 ). I was ABSOLUTELY ecstatic!!! To see her beaming for joy was a beautiful heartwarming thing. He proposed to her around all their friends when they went on a camping trip. How cute, right? She face-timed me to tell me and show me the ring. I jumped up and down and squealed for her hahaha. A few months after she was talking to me about plans for their wedding. They decided to hold off until they both graduated college to officially get married. I think that's a very wise decision on their part. After telling me this, she proceeded to say- \u201cOh btw. Destiny ( 18 ) is probably going to be my Maid Of Honor. Hope you aren\u2019t upset.\u201d I won\u2019t lie, it was like a slap to the face and it did hurt. Her and Destiny became friends when she moved to Maine. They\u2019ve been friends for around 7 years now. It hurt me only because I feel even though she\u2019s been great friends with her, it would make more sense for me to be that since we\u2019ve had a close friendship of 11 years going on 12 now. I didn\u2019t want her to feel I was trying to be an ass or poison the conversation on something exciting, so I kept quiet for now. I waited a month and I couldn\u2019t shake the hurt I was feeling. Since she moved I felt a bit like I was now the \u201cPast\u201d so to speak. I texted Macy- explaining how I truly felt and how I wasn\u2019t trying to create issues, but just voicing my feelings. She told me she was never trying to hurt me but that Destiny just meant a lot to her\u2026.but don\u2019t I as well? She told me I could still be a bridesmaid but it was just the bluntness and putting a friend she hasn\u2019t known for as long in that position that truly just hurt me and made me feel off.  Am I the asshole for being upset about this? ",

        "selftext": "For a little context I met my BF in high school. We dated off and on early in our friendship but over the past 12 years aside from a short Covid fling we\u2019ve been solid long distance buddies. There was a discussion about moving in with BF in their town to restart my life. BF always thought I should get out of my old city. I said no that I couldn\u2019t live in a small town. Last year BF brought it up and told me that was an ask to try to get back together. This has been in the back of mind, but I never acted on it. Well over the past month BF returned into my life full time for a bit. First was visiting parents and secondly we planned a cruise in my friend group. I started catching feelings during the time we hung out. It fully set in over the cruise. Not sure exactly what I was feeling at that time, but I figured I had time to sort myself out. Turns out one of the people(NG) we met on the cruise made a huge impact.  What was supposed a short stay at the beach post cruise with three friends left over turned into a scene out of a romance movie that would have the whole dinner table turning heads to listen. My other friend and I became background characters to GF and BFs vacation. It had classics like a spontaneous a road trip and sleeping on the beach. I did not handle it well. The first few days BF noticed and pointed it out. I confessed after some prodding and BF was very nice about it. GF listened to me babble and made sure I was ok. That bit of honesty, however, unleashed a torrent of emotion I didn\u2019t know I had. I became a vacuum of negativity. It got worse as I literally had front seats to their growing flirting, whispers and lack of presence to others in the group.  The lowest was when BFs new partner tried to warm up to me and give me \u201cwe can talk about anything that\u2019s bothering you\u201d line. Having the person who swept your crush off their feet try to console you is a torture fit for one of the nine hells. The last night before we all flew back my BF decided to ditch the group for hankey pankey while we were on the understanding that we would hang out before going our separate ways. Radio silence till 7am next day. When they got back I lost it and said things about BF being selfish and making the whole trip about themselves, rubbing their relationship in everyone else\u2019s face until they couldn\u2019t be bothered to have is around. Couldn\u2019t show some restraint for a few days? There was a \u201csorry you felt that way\u201d apology. I shut down and left for the airport by myself in the morning as BF and NG shared a shower in our hotel. I got a tearful phone messages saying that BG doesn\u2019t want to lose me and that I can take my time to pieces things, but no apology. I\u2019ve blocked her, for my own sanity but I felt disrespected. I probably should have said something earlier. Maybe never say anything at all and pack it down. Crush or not I find it hard to see me as the asshole here for expecting some restraint. I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m the asshole, but how big am I?",

The law in my city states we get 2 free months of rent in these situations. (15K in our situation)  But the new owner wants us out faster than that and offered us $30K to be out at the end of the month. We took it but now we have to divvy up the money. My thinking is we should take the first 15K and divide it by what we pay for rent normally, then the extra 15K on top will be split evenly 5 ways.  Everyone else thinks we should split the entire 30K by how everyone pays rent. Which i think is ridiculous, because that extra $15K was never part of the plan. No one should be entitled to a percentage of something they didn\u2019t pay into? They\u2019re thinking about it like a business, an investment. But rent is a bill, not a business. That extra money came about purely bc of a situational issue, not bc more money was \u201cinvested\u201d I feel taken advantage of by my friends and even my own boyfriend.

We planned a huge brunch for our friends to ask them to be a part of our wedding party back in March of 2024. Everyone of course said yes, however, as time went on, a groomsman needed to back out so we needed to backfill the position to make it equal for our wedding party to walk down the aisle. Of course, it didn't bother me that my brother-in-law was not initially asked because my finance does have a lot closer friends that he has been friends with for years and we hang out with every weekend. When going over who my fiance was going to add to his side of our wedding party, he mentioned asking another friend of his, I told him it should be my brother-in-law and not his old best friend. Some background, my fiance and my brother-in-law are pretty close, we see him and my sister quite often as my sister is one of my best friends, and our kids (6) are the same age and hang out all the time. This friend that my fiance wanted to add to his wedding party was a really good friend of ours when we first started dating, he and his now finance were some of our best friends that we hung out with every weekend, however, we stopped hanging out with them both for about two years as the friend would make comments about me being a stay at home mom and living off my finance. Me and my fiance both agreed that I would be a stay-at-home mom while I finished college. Fast forward to today, we reconnected with our friends and after a serious apology from my fiance's friend we started to become a part of each other's lives, We only see them maybe once or twice a month, so I was confused as to why my fiance would want him in our wedding over my brother-in-law. I understand that they were best friends for years, and this is his side of the wedding party but my brother-in-law has always been there for us and never has done us wrong. So am I the asshole for asking my fiance to have my brother-in-law over his old best friend?",

I was making good money so it didn't bother me, I could support the family financially alone. And I did. My family wanted for nothing. And my wife took care of the home, cooking, cleaning, laundry.  Fast forward to now and we are empty nesters. I still work, I have my own business I'm growing for the last 5 years. My wife takes care of the home. Our youngest child came home to handle some health issues.  My wife took him to the hospital for an out patient cardiac procedure that took all day.  Here's where I might be the AH. I work from home, specifically in the lounge in our building. During the day when my wife and kid was at the hospital, I took a work break. I went upstairs, made myself lunch, then went back to work downstairs. I left the pots and dirty dishes in the sink. So when my wife came home late from the hosipital with our kid still in pain from the procedure, she came home to the dirty dishes.  But washing dishes is her job, that was our arrangement. And I had A LOT of work to do. So AITA? ",

        "selftext": "So for context I'm autistic and am extremely sensitive to light (like, I get migraines from sunny days). One of my housemates really likes ambient lighting and I've had to ask her to take a motion sensor light down in the hall and on another occassion she took another light down after I suggested a compromise. So now in our living room she's put 3 lamps which are just exposed, high strengh lightbulbs (with no shades). To be fair I almost never use the living room, in part because of anxiety but also in part because our other housemate (who is now moving out) has anger management issues so it wasn't a great vibe. But I was hoping to actually socialise with the new housemate who I have mutual friends with. I also had to take my migraine meds when she left the door to the living room open with one of the lights on but tbf she's now moved it out of view from thedoor. WIBTA if I asked her to get rid of the lamps from the living room/move them to her room? I think I might be TA because I've already asked her to remove lights from common areas, she's spent money on them and has them in a room that I barely ever use. Edit: So for info I'm not against any light, in the previous situation I just asked to have the overhead light on instead as I can just wear a cap. But I see that people are right that I am/would be the asshole, thank you for the feedback. ",

We\u2019ve had a lot of ups and downs, we\u2019ve got 3 kids and he has never put in a lot of effort for my birthday (or any other holiday, for that matter). But we\u2019ve worked through a lot this past year and I know he is trying to put in more effort. He told me recently that he was going to pay someone to come deep clean our house as my birthday present. To be fair, I have said many times that I would love to have this done but it isn\u2019t something we need to be spending money on right now so we haven\u2019t done it.  He followed this up by saying that if I didn\u2019t want to spend the money, he would gladly just take the whole day and do it himself. When he told me this, I wanted to be very mindful of my reaction. Again, he has not been in the habit of gift giving or being super thoughtful when it comes to special occasions. I told him that I really appreciated the thought and saw the effort that would take for him to do but if he took the entire day to clean the house, I would obviously just be watching my kids and trying to keep them from coming behind him and messing all of his hard work up and ultimately that doesn\u2019t sound like a present. I felt guilty because I want to praise his effort but I also feel like this \u201cgift\u201d doesn\u2019t feel personal or thought out well, despite the effort. He didn\u2019t seem too upset by my reaction but now I\u2019m afraid he isn\u2019t going to do anything? I\u2019m also feeling a bit frustrated because if the roles were reversed, I would (and have) set something up where he would be able to go do something he loved with his friends and not have to worry about me or his kids.

In this group there are 2 people which I will call Laura (F) & Paul (M). They are both in their early thirties. I have been very close to them. My relationship with Laura is based on a lot of compassion, laughter & we are basically telling each other almost everything, she helped a lot at the beginning when I started and she believes in me.  With Paul the relationship I would say have been a bit toxic but good, as I was always afraid of how he would react, he would give me a lot of advices based solely on his pov. He never really tried to understand me as a whole (I struggle with mental health), a lot of tough love I would say.  Early December we have decided to buy a common gift for a birthday. Laura has bought a gift. Everyone gave the money, except for Paul . When she confronted him, he stated that he's been really struggling financially & big family issues. She tried to understand but for her it was not a valid reason and he should have tried to communicate instead of ignoring her. Paul owes me a significant amount of money too. Paul has been ignoring my texts for 2 weeks and being very avoidant at work. He finally replied and I was shocked. He stated that I should have said something to her and basically I am bad friend for not taking his side and he was more there for me than her (which is not true) & he's taking his distances from everyone as our establishment will close in 2 months.  I told him I didn't want to be in the middle of this (I have a past with this), you are both my friends and I simply can not choose. He is forgetting that I have helped him in the past, I was there for him. He didn't understand he chooses to stop talking & unfollowed me on social media. I don't think I will see my money ever again.  Laura has been very supportive, understood I will not take sides and our relationship has not changed.  I have lost a friend, but AITA for not taking the side & being more supportive ? Thank you for reading.  Edit: names for clarity",

In a hasty decision to have everything settled, I kept the division of property and debt as simple as possible - I take care of my credit cards, she takes care of her credit cards, car and car loan. (If it matters, we're divorced in Nevada, US). Years later, I filed for bankruptcy because I was struggling to pay the debt (about $15k) we accumulated together. As stated in the divorce decree, she is responsible for the car and car loan. However, I am primary, and she is co-signer. Both of our names are on the title and registration. Eventually, I know she'll need something from me like a signature for the car. She refuses to refinance because she doesn't want to meet with me. Mutual friends have been saying I should have collected money from her for partial amount of the debt. I don't have as good of a job as she does now.

So about a day ago R had told us in the gc that S was going out with a guy that was interested in her. This guy Z(20M) had liked S for a long time, but I still felt weird about him. There was a rumor not too long ago that really made everyone in the gc dislike him but we found out that of course the rumors were fake. Still I felt weird about him. S had been talking to Z for a long time and says that his a genuine, nice, kind guy. Z had been asking S out to get to know her better and to finally talk to her in person but S would refuse but then finally she gave in. He even stated that if she felt uncomfortable seeing him by herself that she could come someone, which is what S did. They're probably on the that date right now as I am writing this. So when R told us in the gc that S was going out with Z of course people in the gc didn't see an issue since S had clarified time and time again that Z was not a bad person. Still as I said I still felt weird about him. I have a lot of trust issues with men since I've seen a lot of trashy men with the women around me. So I voiced my concern, I didn't know that this would turn into a whole agreement in the gc about marriage.  L and R were the one's that were going at it, I'd chip in here and there giving my two cents on the agreement but the argument ended, or so I thought. This morning the argument resurfaced again since L had told said, (my name) is hater of men so S don't listen to her My friends already know how I feel about men and this is a joke in the gc so I didn't take it the wrong way. We started joking once again me, R and L in the GC I had said, before you girls go looking for a husband or man with nothing to your name go look for money first I really just said this as a joke not think someone would get offensed to this. I left the gc after saying this since I have things to do around the house after a few hours I come back to the GC to see an argument between R and L. R was saying that before you get married it's better to be financially stable, L was saying that you just need to find a good man and saying that getting married doesn't mean one needs to stop improving themselves. After a while they found out that they were arguing about the same thing but just from different perspectives.  R asked L why they're even arguing to which L proceeded to reply to my previous comment about looking for money instead of getting married. She said it seemed that I had an inferiority complex to which R replied asking how. L proceed to say that it must have rubbed her the wrong way and the conversation ended there. I didn't want to say anything in the GC so I texted L privately asking her how my comment rubbed her the wrong way and how she felt. She is yet to reply to me and when she does I'll update you.

So, I've been feeling down for a while and have not been able to pull my weight in our household.. so last night I pulled myself together and did my best to clean the floors downstairs since she was complaining she wouldn't get it done...I know this was due to my lack of action, I'm probably the jerk there, which is why I wanted to give her a worryfree weekend and do the floors for her.. I could only do the floors tho, no dusting or whatever... it's not even dusty since I did it last week..I even told her I would do them next week (I leave tomorrow for the weekend) My mom came back from school an immediately began pointing out what hadn't been done and said nothing about what I did do until I pointed  it out. This isn't the issue,the issue is that I woke up to use the bathroom and have to walk by her room, apparently she was awake and called me over. She started by saying how it bothered her that I cleaned the floors and it kept her up all night. I know how she is and this is usually how fights start, so it being 6am I was quite agitated as I was not in the mood for this so early in the morning. Anyway, she told me she does not appreciate what I've done, that this was not what we agreed upon, why didn't I do the surfaces like I was told, why did I clean the floors, now she's stuck spending the weekend dusting and so on and so forth. At this point I exploded because for the 100th time, it's obvious she doesn't listen to the words coming out of my mouth. I told her I was not doing this at 6 am, that I wanted to go back to bed before my alarm went off. Her answer? Then my day is ruined and I'll have to cancel everything because I can't sleep like this..  At this point I exploded and I might've evolved into the jerk.. I called (screamed) her manipulative and that I am not doing this so early in the morning. That I was digusted that she would be acting like this over me trying to do something nice for her. She told me I didn't do it for her, I did it for myself to manipulate HER and what was she supposed to do this weekend? Guys, I was honestly flabbergasted.... I was like anything you want?!  Apparently, she can't do anything she wants now because I manipulated her by doing what I want and now she has to dust and clean the surfaces... I.TOLD.HER.TWICE.AT.THIS.POINT. that I would do them.  The conversation was going nowhere and I didn't want the cops called on us for our screaming match this early in the morning, so I cut the conversation short and removed myself from the situation, which..made her even more mad but at this point I didn't even care, I was hurt and angry. Back to my room I went. I just.. I'm at a loss..am I really such a manipulative monster for what I did? Am I in the wrong? Was my thinking off? Should I have just done the stupid dusting? It may sound stupid, I know it does... So here I am..",

So for some backstory my girlfriend has a friend (Sarah) who had a roommate (Cate) living with her and she had a cat there that she left. Eventually Cate moved and abandoned the cat basically leaving Sarah to take care of the cat for months by herself. I heard many bad things about Cate and her cat but that's just what I heard anyway; I'm at a party with my girlfriend and she's with the lady's in a room when she come into a different room with me and the guys saying that Cate said the cat was pregnant then threw that cat and said she didnt want her anymore! I wasn't there but I believe her when it comes to stuff like that she had a cat for 14 years and she's very passionate about animals. The next day Sarah calls my girlfriend and says the cats throwing up and unfortunately had worms and wasn't pregnant. So Me and her take the cat to a shelter because we can't afford to do the surgery and all that but wanted what's best. Now I'm adopting the cat but Cate is now looking for it claiming she wanted the cat. Am I in the wrong for kidnapping this cat? Sorry for the long post and it may not be the best it's my first. Edit 2: incase I wasnt clear Me, my girlfriend,  and Sarah talked about taking the cat up for Sarah when we heard it was sick. We didn't just straight up steal it but in this context yes it's stolen  Edited namesAlso names changed obviously for privacy reasonsTldr Friends roommate abused cat (allegedly) and we took her so the cat stays safe.  UPDATE: I HAVE DA KITTY!! She's doing much much better now and she's become a huge cuddlebug:p Still recovering from surgeries and stuff but she's much happier! Thank you all for your feedback and if anyone is interested I can update on the kitty.",

        "selftext": "New account because I'm pretty sure my step dad is chronically on reddit. I (17 F) have a cat named Fluff and have had him for at least three-four years. He was originally a feral the neighbors had picked up from the road; never took care of him and me and him eventually bonded so he chooses me over anyone else, even after we moved to our new house around last June. (This is important for later) Along with Fluff, we had another cat who passed, named Lynx. He was also from the neighbors. On day one of begging to bring my cats to the new house (they were going to ditch them and leave them to be neglected) my step father (36 M) said they were **my cats** and they'd be my responsibility. They paid for their food only (i paid for vet visits, even when i didn't have enough money to buy my own stuff); i paid to put Lynx down and cremated after he got sick since i didnt have enough money to give him the proper treatment for maggots and didn't want him to suffer. I just recently bought Fluff a tracking collar and a carrier, explaining to my step father (lets call him Jack for jackass) when he asked that I would be taking my cat with me to college. He got angry and berated me for a while, saying what he says goes and that Fluff would be unhappy with me and that I'd go nowhere in life. In the midst of his desperation, he even offered to buy me a kitten and to pay for the shots.  The problem is, I don't want to replace Fluff with a new kitten, and he doesn't see that. Jack hardly even looks at my cat (which, btw, hes saying its HIS cat now) and I'm scared that when I leave he's going to be neglected again. Fluff has gone through a lot for a 5 year old (roughly around) cat already, and I don't want him to be scared of being around the house again (hes an outside cat since he was a feral; ive been training him and he does well. Jack left him out during the harsh winter storm we had a bit back.) I'd have a dorm and I could legally register him as my emotional support animal; and this would all be in another year or so after i try to get income to save. So, reddit, WIBTA if i took my cat to college with me?",

        "selftext": "I (16F) have been going though a conflict. My dad's back at home for his break, but he's thinking about getting a job closer to town (he works like 7 hours away from our home) and we can be a happy family, right? Wrong. I always get scared when he comes home because he can get aggressive sometimes and him and mom always fight. Whether it's about money or cheating allegations (which I'll touch later on in the post). But I've heard many, many stories of them being soo in love (mostly my dad because he went after my mom first). So I've been thinking, what if they divorced? I mean dad did joke about it once and because of that joke I had a dream they divorced. I don't want them to get divorced, but whenever dad's home I feel like...it's just not it. Anddd sooo, I am a snoopy little shit and I recorded one of their arguments to see what was going on and maybe if I could help. Here's the tea. My dad's a chef and works in the kitchen and yup, he works with plenty of women. And this woman that he worked with got a foot surgery or something like that, from what I could pull from the recording and he asked if he could massage her feet... Dad says they were joking or whatever and says my mom was always jealous. Which to be fair, my mom accused him multiple times of cheating, but dad always says that bullshit that she needs to trust him blah, blah, blah..OH AND BTW HE DOESN'T SEE A PROBLEM WITH HAVING A BUNCH OF GIRL FRIENDS AND A PASSWORD ON HIS PHONE THAT MY MOM PROBABLY DOESN'T KNOW (\ud83d\udea9).I did feel guilty afterwards because I recorded something that was really private. I'm just a dumb kid. I can't fix a failing marriage. I don't know what to say to them or do. And if I'm being for real right now, I wish my dad would still have his old job. Yes, it was...a good pay (ig idk much about finance) and we lived a happy stable life, but he did work a lot like 9 AM to 10 PM almost every day. And I mean I still felt sorry for him even after everything he had done. It's really distracting me from school and I don't know who to tell or even how to strike a conversation about it. So am I the asshole for thinking my parents should divorce and for recording their conversations?",

And now my parents borrowed a suit from my cousin(from the other side of the family)\u2026 it\u2019s one of those suits with a vest, a white shirt, and a bow tie. I knew I wouldn\u2019t be able to get out of dressing up somehow, but I at least wanted a cool outfit like a black suit with a gray shirt or something. Definitely not a white shirt and absolutely no stupid bow tie. But my parents are saying that since I hate formal clothes anyway and won\u2019t wear them again before I outgrow them, they don\u2019t want to waste money. We had a fight about it, but no chance, I have to wear the full suit. I teased my cousin back then when he had to wear it. He hates formal clothes like me, and I made fun of him, said he looked like a choirboy in that outfit and that I would never let my parents force me to wear something like that, especially not a stupid bow tie. Now he\u2019s already super annoying because my parents borrowed his suit for me. I told him I\u2019d only wear it without the bow tie and without the vest. But I know he\u2019s gonna stalk my family\u2019s social media on Saturday, and if he sees a picture of me, I\u2019m done. He\u2019ll never let me live it down. He\u00b4s going to roast me for the next 10 years. My parents don\u2019t know that and I can\u2019t tell them, they are only getting annoyed with me. I told my parents that I just don\u2019t want to be in any photos at the wedding, but they say that would be rude and that I have to be in the photos. But why, I should be able to decide whether I want to be on photos or not?",

        "selftext": "So for context, this is about me and a friend.So me and let's call her Amy, used to be best friends, and in a trio with Sarah (fake names). But Amy had a habit of talking over people and cutting them, which ticked Sarah off A LOT. After 3-4 months, we finally confronted her about it, and Sarah went really low contact with Amy. Although i did want to continue being friends with Amy, i went no contact with everyone for a solid 2 months. After this, we slowly started talking as i took the initiative and contacted her, apologized and suggested to reconcile. She agreed and we agreed to meet up. On the day of the meetup, my parents needed me for some things so i had to cancel. Then we changed the dates, but my doctor's appointment was finalized on that day, i thought i could meet up with her after that, but doc was out for lunch and returned half an hour later, which is why i canceled it. I asked her today whether she'd be interested in meeting up, but she declined saying that i had disappointed her twice. Since we're in a very tense and delicate situation, I'd like some clarity.AITA? Update: After being schooled by everyone here, i spoke to Amy. We exchanged perspectives and she said that she felt guilty about the whole ordeal and it never occurred to me that she wouldn't be angry at me, but at herself. I told her that i fumbled real hard(\ud83d\udc80) and that I'll respect whatever her decision is. And unfortunately for some people who were expecting Amy to cut me off, (bless her heart) said she'll consider it and tell me what her final answer is soon.

        "selftext": "Hi AITA, I have a 5 year old cardigan corgi. He\u2019s an absolute unit, and as my friends say, he\u2019s high in strength/constitution and low in intelligence/wisdom. He often tries to eat things that aren\u2019t safe for him.  I live alone and hired a dog walker I found on Rover to visit him once a day during the work week. Instead of going through the app, I agreed to pay her in cash. She\u2019s generally been great. But, we\u2019ve had a few mishaps like her not telling me when my dog ate and tore up a wooden hand fan. I\u2019ve given her the benefit of the doubt because my dog loves her and enjoys his walks with her.  Last night, my dog vomited up five or so partially chewed, large, bright-orange seeds. They are from the coontie plant and are in the same family as sago palms, which can be fatally toxic to dogs even in small amounts. Unfortunately, they are part of the landscape in my \u201cdog-friendly\u201d apartment complex.  I decided not to wait it out and took my dog to the emergency vet. They admitted him to critical care because the risk of him deteriorating was so high, even though he was in good spirits when I left him.  I messaged my dog walker to let her know what happened, and she insists she never saw him eat the seeds and that she tries to prevent him from eating things on the ground. I know he did not eat the seeds on my watch, because I exclusively took him to the turf-only dog park yesterday, which isn\u2019t near the toxic plants.  This emergency vet visit is costing thousands of dollars. I haven\u2019t brought up the cost to her yet, but WIBTA to request that she contributes to this huge expense? I get it\u2019s my dog, but also I have never let this happen on my watch. I understand it was likely an honest mistake, but also I feel as though it\u2019s really irresponsible to let someone\u2019s dog eat random things off the ground, especially if you aren\u2019t paying close attention.  Edit \u2014 Thanks everyone for your feedback. I will absolutely accept that I would be TA if I asked my walker to contribute to my vet bills. I had several people in my life reach out and suggest I ask, hence this post.  I will not be asking her to pay. I will, however, invest in good pet insurance and will only pay dog walkers through Rover from now on.  I will clarify a few things for the sake of this post. - Yes, I pointed out the unsafe area. - Yes, she knows he will eat things off the ground, but she also knows he is trained and responsive to several commands including \u201cleave it\u201d, \u201cdrop it\u201d, and \u201cwait\u201d.  - This plant is only in specific parts of the complex, which are easily avoidable. - Yes, multiple sources have confirmed this was a life-threatening situation for my dog due to what was ingested.  Edit Part 2: Electric Boogaloo \u2014 Thank you AGAIN for everyone\u2019s feedback. My Hoover of a dog is doing okay, his labs look good and hopefully he\u2019s coming home soon.  A few more things I\u2019ll add: - I will absolutely be investing in a muzzle.- like some of you have suggested, it might be worthwhile to invest in a more vetted walker (instead of Rover)- I am very blessed, and my low rider Unit of a dog\u2019s bills are paid (yes, by some of the very people who asked whether I was going to ask my current walker for compensation)- I walked my apartment complex\u2019s property this morning. On the very far side of my building, there is a line of these palms that were apparently just trimmed, and there are huge piles of the seeds all lined up. Dog walker admitted to letting my Dyson Dog \u201csniff\u201d the seeds, so \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f- it\u2019s a moot point because there are lots of things I will do moving forward to prevent this from happening again (boy I\u2019m dense, I genuinely don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t think of a muzzle in the first place \u2014 I\u2019ve used things like grazing muzzles for my horses before). - Medical scares and renewed agency are one hell of a drug. - I do want to say, I\u2019ve truly been trying my best. I came here for feedback, and I got what I needed to move forward and keep my dumb dog safe. Reddit gives me tough love, and even when it stings, I\u2019m grateful. - I talked to the front office staff about the plants. If anything, maybe some signs can be posted. ",

So basically, there\u2019s this game show called Traitors, and I like watching it. So me and him agree to meet at 9 for it. This might sound weird, but me and my girlfriend like to sleep on call together, and she had an early start so fell asleep at 9, although we were talking for a little after.Then my friend came down, and he said \u2018What the heck?\u2019 and I told him to give me one second, but before I know it he\u2019s telling me to f*ck off, flipping me off and leaving.I then tried to message him after and I feel I got called every swear word under the sun, saying how I ditched him to be with my girlfriend. I am a serious people pleaser, so I was trying my best to resolve the situation, and then he texted he forgave me and we can move on. Although, ever since that day, he hasn\u2019t been the same. He acts the exact same around the rest of our friends, but he doesn\u2019t speak to me, acting like I don\u2019t exist. I honestly wanted to soothe things over and figure things out.This became evident to the rest of my friends in my friend group, so I told some of them everything, and so far everyone is on my side.But I don\u2019t take it at face value. I think it\u2019s worth clarifying, I\u2019ve never seen this man flip anything off in his life. And very rarely swears. So I want to get your guys\u2019 opinions.

My main boundary is that nobody tells me how to live my life.  For small context, the school system here sucks. I have ADHD, and learning was very difficult for me. I was also harassed by a boy in my freshman year and had other bad experiences. School hurt my mental health, and I felt increasingly depressed. So, in my Junior year, I dropped out. After that, I felt happier, more confident, and my art block was gone. R mentioned my decision to drop out and encouraged me to return, saying I would struggle and regret it later. I explained that school wasn't for me and that it had been difficult for me, but R replied, I get you don't like school, but I don't like it either and yet I still go.  Frustrated and hurt that R didn\u2019t understand my feelings, I asked them to stop talking about school. Today, R and A were discussing summer jobs and asked when I would apply for one. I told them I wasn't looking for a job because I wasn't interested in working right now. R reacted strongly, calling me crazy and insisting that getting a job would be beneficial and something I should consider. She mentioned that there are people with disabilities who can't work, which I found unnecessary. I explained that I'm too stressed to maintain a job and that I'm busy with my art commissions. The pressure to finish my drawings is already overwhelming, and handling a job would be too much. I reassured R that I don't think I'm crazy for my choice, and I plan to get a job in the future when I feel ready. We decided to Agree to Disagree and left it at that. I called a friend, D (16), to share what happened and my feelings about it. D said my feelings were valid and encouraged me to confront R. I wrote a honest and respectful message to R, clearly stating my boundaries and explaining how it hurt to have them broken. R replied with a dry Okay, won't bring it up again. A contacted me, saying I made R feel stupid and like an asshole because of my response. A said I acted immaturely and could have handled the situation better, which I admit is true. They told me R didn\u2019t need to apologize and that I was in the wrong, expressing their concern and worry. While I understand their worry, I felt my boundary was crossed and that someone was constantly criticizing how I should live my life. This made me angry, and I yelled at them in a voice message before blocking them on most social media. Some friends think I could have managed it better, but D thinks I was valid in feeling upset. I\u2019m torn because maybe R did care, but I dislike being controlled and treated like I won\u2019t succeed just cause i wanna be happy.  AITA?",

Last November she decided she wanted to go on a trip for her birthday. Conveniently it was \u201cfor our birthdays even though I went in support to what she wanted to do and we traveled all day on my birthday.

        "selftext": "For New Year I (29F) decided to surprise my mom by coming home on NYE, as I just had a baby, her first grandchild, and have dinner with my family. I told my sister (23) I was coming, and wanted to order some food for everyone to eat. I searched for the best price and found a menu for $89.50 for 10 people. Apparently, the minimum order for these type of menus is 10, and they give you big trays of food. I asked her to split the bill with me, and told her that they could keep the leftovers to eat that week, and in case any of our friends wanted to hang out, we would have something to offer. At first she said she was not willing to pay for more food than we needed, and that she wanted to find another option for less people or where they would sell individual plates. IMO I thought the option I found was a good offer, but agreed to let her find another option. After 3 days I asked her if she found something, but she never even looked. We were running out of time so I told her I was going to pay for it and that she could pay me her half, which she did. I told my two best friends I was arriving on the 31st and I invited them both over, and told them we would have some food. My sister also told me she invited her BF over, which was perfectly fine. Flash forward to NYE, I was traveling home and told my sister that my two friends MIGHT come hang out but was not sure, to which she answered asking if they were going to put some money for the food. I said no, we already paid for it, and there was more than enough to share. I then asked if she would ask her boyfriend to pay for his dish. She said he was not coming anymore, but if he wouldve came, she would in fact ask him for the money. She said, and I quote, why do I have to pay for your friends' food if the whole point of ordering that much was for us to keep the leftovers to eat the rest of the week. At this point I was flabbergasted & in shock of her attitude and told her I was NOT going to ask my friends (one who was picking me up at the airport on New Years Eve, and the other who even when I was not there, would visit them bringing food and baked goods to share with my family) for money; that if she was in so much need of $18 I would give it to her when I arrived. To which she answered in a voice note CRYING telling ME I was an AH, was not empathetic with her and her situation and that she was extremely sad of my lack of consideration (the vn was 3 min long but that was basically the summary). At this point I was over it and about to take off so I just didn't answer. At the end of the night, neither of my friends went to my house.

        "selftext": "**Edit - I shouldn't have said she confided in me, C would have told my bf herself and it really wasn't a big deal because S is always doing stupid stuff. I know C didn't care about me telling him. While I appreciate responses, I realize I should have been more clear in my wording.That being said, my issue is the principle of me saying Do not repeat this and him instantly involving himself. If I had told him something that was a secret, obviously he couldn't keep one. That's it, that's all. **  I'm so worked up. So help me reddit, AITA?  In this scenario there are 3 sets of male/female couples, who are good friends. Couples consist of me and my boyfriend, C+J, and S+S Lately the 2 other females in this friend group have been getting into it. C confided in me about their argument, and I told my boyfriend about it tonight while we were hanging out. Before I even told him anything, I literally started by saying Do. Not. Repeat. This  Well I left his place and he was already messaging C about it by the time I got home. He brought the very thing I said do not repeat to, up, not even 20 minutes after I left. Now, C doesn't care I'm sure, but my boyfriends obviously clueless what do not repeat means. He kept saying C was fine with it, and he thought I meant do not repeat this to S+S..  So after I was flabbergasted he brought it up, he really gave me a half ass apology and was saying things like Considering we're in a relationship she'd  know you would tell me, and that I'm being juvenile, and the whole thing is crazy, I'm making a way bigger deal out of it then I should be and how C didn't say I couldn't tell him so therefore it doesn't matter.   Honestly I kept saying this wasn't about C, it's the principle of me literally asking him not to repeat it, him saying he understood and then going and doing the exact same thing I asked him not to. He doesn't get it. I didn't realize I had to say every person's name for something to not be repeated.  If I'm in the wrong for making a big deal about this, I'd love to know.. AITA?? ",

        "selftext": "This argument happened in a previous relationship, but I still think about it and wonder if I was in the wrong. I, a 21-year-old woman at the time, was dating my 22-year-old boyfriend, Zach. Zach and I had been dating for about 1.5 years, but we were long distance due to college. So, when we were in the same state, we were inseparable. One night after we had sex and were about to fall asleep, I rolled over to find Zach playing a car video game on his phone. I cuddled into him, hoping he\u2019d put the game down, but he kept playing. I jokingly said something like, \u201cI guess I\u2019m more boring than the game.\u201d He laughed and explained that he played this game most nights before bed, like how some people read or watch shows to wind down. He said it wasn\u2019t personal and not to take it the wrong way. Over time, this became a regular thing, and I started to feel uncomfortable with it. A bit of context: I\u2019m queer, and at the time, I had a strong preference for women. Zach and I had been friends for years before we started dating, so while I loved him, he was the male exception for me. Because of this, I was particularly sensitive to things that might turn me off when it came to intimacy. Eventually, I got frustrated and told him I wasn\u2019t okay with him playing phone games in bed. I said he could play, but not while we were naked together. He then argued that he needed it; it was part of his nightly routine and helped him unwind. I told him that was stupid which was not nice and he totally shut down. I felt bad that I couldn\u2019t just let this go but it was starting to effect our relationship. Was I the asshole for not being able to get past my boyfriend playing video games in bed?",

        "selftext": "My gf (23F) recently mentioned to me (23M) that she wants to have a night out with her friend from school. I asked her what the plan was and if she wanted me to go too. She said it was implied that I was invited but that it is more of a girls night. I asked who she was going with and it was her friend who she has told me some stories about. The stories were basically that every time they went out together this friend would get super drunk, try to get w dudes every time and would leave my gf alone for most of the night. Now idc that a single girl is going out and doing her thing, we\u2019re young and she\u2019s allowed to put herself out there ofc. But how am I supposed to feel comfortable with my gf going out w her after hearing all this? I do trust her, understand that they are not the same person and don\u2019t think she would cheat on me or anything like that. But how could I not be thinking she might end up in a shitty situation where she\u2019s alone in a college bar and I can\u2019t do anything about it? They\u2019d also be going out about an hour away from us. My gf would be driving and I told her honestly if she went out near us at least I could pick them up and that would make me feel way more comfortable. But this girl is still in school so she\u2019d go see her at a bar near the college which is another problem cause why would you drink and drive? She said she wouldn\u2019t drink that much but still. I told her I\u2019d like to go so I can meet her and get the chance to see what she\u2019s like for myself. That way if she\u2019s cool then i wouldn\u2019t care if they went out together because i\u2019d know her better at least. My gf said she\u2019d feel fine if i went out w my friends, but the difference is we don\u2019t go out really ever like that, they\u2019re all in serious relationships and she\u2019s met all 3 of them. She then said she\u2019s not going and it\u2019s fine, but clearly was upset and was making it obvious. I just don\u2019t want to be controlling and feel like i\u2019m holding her back from hanging out w her friends, especially cause she\u2019s been going through it recently in her personal life. But this does makes me uncomfortable, what should I do?",

        "selftext": " Me (26 yo female) and my boyfriend (24 yo male) have been dating for 5.5 years. We are currently on vacation in Hawaii and to save some money for excursions and food we decided to rent a car through a more budget friendly place. The first car we received had a cracked interior and scratches and bumps on the exterior but ran and worked so we didn\u2019t think too much of it.  But then we started to notice some sounds that made us concerned that the bearings could be messed up or who knows what. So we asked the rental car place about it and they gave us a different car. This car was similar condition but it has the check engine light on. As soon we we noticed that, my bf said it\u2019s fine and we shouldn\u2019t worry about it. But I was concerned and encouraged him to please ask the rental car guy. So he reluctantly did and apparently all the rental car guy said was \u201cit\u2019s fine, but if it starts blinking on and off there\u2019s an issue so call us\u201d. I personally don\u2019t feel comfortable renting a car with a check engine light on, I don\u2019t care that it is a discounted rental car place, that doesn\u2019t mean that you should accept a car that has a check engine light on. But my BF used to work in a car shop years ago and he isn\u2019t concerned. I know that the check engine light being on could mean a myriad of different things from things that aren\u2019t concerning to things that can be a safety hazard. Personally, I am worried that while we are driving in an area without service (there are a lot of them) or when we are driving on the road to Hana or some narrow winding single lane trail with cliff edges and no guardrails, something is going to go wrong. He doesn\u2019t seem to be concerned about it and I am encouraging him to please drive us back to the rental car place and ask for a car without a check engine light on. He told me if I want a different rental car, he\u2019s not coming and I will have to go 30-45 min back to the rental car place by myself once we get back (even though we will be close to the rental car place on our way back to where we are staying). I truly think it is rude how he is not taking my concern seriously and is unwilling to switch out for a different rental car or at least ask them and telling me I have to do it (he is the one who made the reservation). He thinks I\u2019m entitled and that I\u2019m just upset I\u2019m \u201cnot getting my way\u201d. Am I the asshole? UPDATE: just thought I would let everyone know that my boyfriend agreed to ask the owner if he knew why the check engine light was on and if they have a different car for us to use. We went and the owner said he does not know why, and offered another car with a check engine light on. We kept ours for another hour or so, during which the seals on the front doors loosened so there was wind loudly on each side, there became an identified issue with the shifter in which we could not switch from reverse to drive and slid backward for a moment into oncoming traffic, and the whole area on the driver side holding the lock/unlock and window clickers pulled off when my bf closed the door. We asked for a refund which the owner gave us and rented a jeep through budget car rental.\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc",

She asked if she could have some friends over tonight to celebrate. I made food and cake for them. When she got home from school, I surprised her with everything I prepared, gave her some small gifts, and specifically asked if we will be lighting the candles on the cake together with her friends. She said yes. Her friends come to celebrate. She immediately sends her little sister (11F) to her/my room, as she wants the living room for herself. 3 hours go by, no cake is being cut. Her sister is upset (telling me, as she is not allowed in the living room) she is really waiting for the cake. I say this to my daughter. Half an hour later, her and her friend are singing happy bday, she blew out the candles, they cut the cake. (Not even the one I made - her friend brought another one). She doesn't call me or her sister. She doesn't offer me a piece of the cake. She completely ignores me (I am in my room).WIBTH if I told her ***tomorrow*** she was extremely rude for leaving me and her sister out of the celebration? When we thought we would be included, at least in this small part of it? BTW- she is planning a bigger party to celebrate in a couple of weeks, and she asked if we could let her have the house and go to my parents - and I said yes, as she is a very good kid, I trust her and I don't mind her having a party without her family. I am just really upset she didn't include us in this case, without letting us know in advance.",

So house b I took the computer my brother has from his bedroom to my bedroom since he hasn't used it in a long time, I didn't ask which I know is wrong but I thought Id return it a few days later since I'm only using it to play games, and even if he notices, I'm not moving it houses, just to my bedroom in the same house, so even if he needed it, I could just put it back within a couple of minutes. Anyway I was using it to play games and went to he gym in which I came home to find him asking why I moved the pc and I said just to paly games, since my one in House B is really slow, in which he told me to do bad things to myself, I was taken back and kind of shocked and we bickered and I said I'd tell my parents what he was saying in which he'd say he'd stell them he didn't say that stuff, I'm really shocked by what he said, there was nothing dodgy on the pc btw incase that's your initial thought, I think he's on steroid s for the gym so it might be roid rage but anyway AITA, initially I think I am but what he said is just unacceptable and I don't know if I should tell my parents, as I haven't spoke to any of them in  a few days, my parents know something happened between us, but in the moment he just said I stole his computer and am a liar. I'm really debating telling them as I don't know if they'd take his side of the story and I'm stressed about that or if i should jsut be honest and whoever they believe is not on mem I'm also stressed when they do believe me as I don't want him kicked out or something.

Recently the amount of arguments have increased, dare I say I never have issues with anything and am generally relaxed, however sometimes my SO thinks I'm Too chill and don't stress enough (Which I figure would be a good thing? I just don't see a point in stressing because either things can be fixed, or they're out of my control).  Anyway, today we were in the kitchen and I was washing a couple glasses and we were about to make dinner. She needed a small bit of hot water and I turned the faucet into the sink tub closest to her that I wasn't using. I had the temperature in the middle and about middle pressure too as I was only cleaning a few glasses.  I turned the temperature on hot for her, and considering she only needed a little bit I kept the pressure on medium. She turned the pressure on max, left it for a few seconds, put it back to medium, then got her little bit of water. I asked why she did that and she said it Makes the water boil quicker. I said pressure doesn't, it's whether the temperature is on hot or cold and it would have been hot on the pressure it was on when I gave it to her. She said I was wrong but I insisted.  Lo and behold, argument (On her end). I'm a c word sometimes who never believes her (It's a faucet, there's no conspiracy?), she doesn't want dinner anymore, and she's leaving to either go to the gym, or in her words Park somewhere to get away from you.  I'm confused as to the escalation and if I should have just left it. I didn't say anything in a 'Condescending' tone at all. I said it so monotone and normal like it was just basic conversing. Am I the asshole that I should have just said, Okay you're right and left it? Or is standing my ground about the basic use of a faucet valid?  ",

In all honesty I wasn't really close to carl and I was just having fun playing games with him but there were moments were in where we play and we both would start shouting at each other for fun but there was one instance where in I said sorry to him for how I acted and he accepted it. And after that I just tried not to shout as much and just enjoyed playing with him. And recently during the past few months while we (my other friends and I with Carl) would be in a call carl would do the carl wheezer voice, at first It was funny and we all had some good laughs but at some point I started to resent the voice of carl wheezer and it started to get annoying to me and just a few hours ago carl entered in the call and he was speaking then he used the carl voice again and I told him if he could not do the carl voice anymore cause It's triggering me, I was trying to tell him in a nice way but in the end he just left. I asked a different friend if I was an asshole for saying that and they said yes. I explained myself to them that It wasn't even carl who I don't like but his carl wheezer voice impression and now I feel like spiraling so bad to the point that a different friend said that he (carl) would understand but at this point I don't know if he will because because I just saw that he left my personal server. So like what do I do??? Like am I really the asshole??? I just tried to speak my mind about not liking the carl voice so that he won't do it?? ",

        "selftext": "So I was on VRChat and found some users talking about transgenders and what other \u201cgenders\u201d differ from each other, I eavesdropped through their conversation. And turns out half of the conversation is either about agreeing, disagreeing, or arguing about which gender made more sense than the other. So I decided todo something that I found funny and to lighten up the mood , and it wasn\u2019t much of a joke, but just something random. \u201c\ud83c\udfb5transformers, Robots In Disguise\ud83c\udfb5 btw my gf is bi so she gave me permission to say this and she thought it was funny as well\u201d and immediately my joke got me banned from the instance, I am not sure if I offended them, or not, so am I the asshole?  UPDATE: Ok so I see I am the asshole, first and foremost, when I put the \u201c between transgenders, I did not mean to label them as not people,I believe everyone is human and have the choice to believe what they want to be. At the end just wanted to make at least one person laugh, never meant to be the asshole. I am sorry.  P.S my grammar is not very good.  P.P.S it is true, my girlfriend being bi does not talk for Transgenders but since she was bi, I thought she was connected to the LGBTQ and I was wrong for assuming.",

        "selftext": "AITA for asking my sisters to wear dresses that coordinate together (dusty shades of blue or green and floral print encouraged) even though they're not bridesmaids? I am having a private ceremony (traditional reception immediately after) with only immediate family for my wedding and we are not having bridesmaids/groomsmen. My parents died when I was 16 and my siblings were all young adults, so they're all I have for immediate family. I have 3 sisters who I sent Pinterest photos to and shared my vision for the ceremony in terms of how I'd like their dresses with go with the color scheme, mostly so that family photos will turn out nice and nobody is harshly clashing. Long story short, they're all looking at above the knee summer dresses that are way more casual than I was hoping and also only seem to be looking at cheap Amazon dresses. My middle sister continuously makes jokes about my wedding.(This middle sister also happens to be one who eloped for her second wedding and didn't tell me until after it happened, yet when I announced my engagement said I better be maid of honor) I finally said something to them and asked why they didn't seem to be taking thingS seriously. Were they mad they weren't bridesmaids? I also asked what they had against longer dresses, as I think they look classier, and my oldest sister finally told me You can't expect us to dress so specifically if we're not part of a wedding party. You don't get to have those expectations This is the only thing I've asked of them that leans towards more of a wedding party task I guess. I haven't asked them to throw any pre-wedding parties, haven't asked them to help decorate or anything, and I had even planned a sisters weekend bachelorette party for us. AITA?",

On the way we picked up some of my friends from the movies to take them home, unfortunately we had agreed to pick them up before realizing that his little sisters 11f booster seat was in the back seat still.  My friend made a joke about sitting in it but my bf insisted that wouldn't be safe. So I moved it to the trunk.  Then today I went to see my bf at his house and his dad answered the door really upset.  Apparently he went to take my bfs sister to school today and saw that her booster seat wasn't where it usually is, he couldn't figure out where it was until he eventually texted my bf to ask if he knew. It took a few minutes for my bf to respond and tell him it was in the trunk, their dad unlocked the trunk and put her booster seat back in it's usual spot in the car.  The delay lasted about 15 minutes and made my bfs  sister late for school and their dad wasn't able to get an errand done before work like he had planned.  My bfs dad said it was very rude of me and my bf  to not put the booster seat back from where we moved it.  My bf is mad at me to because his dad lectured him about the importance of the booster seat and suggested he didn't care about his sister's safety at all, his sister overheard this and it really upset her, my bf wants to talk to her and tell her he loves her and cares very much about her safety but she won't let him in her room.

We\u2019ve been together for 2.5 years, but financial struggles and legal issues are making it impossible to afford our current place. It\u2019s devastating\u2014I feel like a failure, and talking about it is really hard. I also have severe ADHD, making emotional regulation difficult. On top of that, I\u2019ve been sick for 10 days, unable to work, and completely drained. Despite knowing this, my mom only wants to talk about finances. I get that she\u2019s worried, but she keeps pushing the conversation despite my repeated boundaries. I physically can\u2019t talk\u2014I lost my voice from coughing so hard I\u2019ve been throwing up. I\u2019ve told her this, yet she keeps bringing it up. I\u2019ve lost nearly 15 pounds from being sick and have begged her to stop, but she won\u2019t. Tonight was the last straw. My fianc\u00e9 is also sick and acting like a big baby about it. I reached my breaking point and snapped at him, but he apologized, realizing I\u2019m just as sick. We\u2019re now resting together, trying to recover. Before that, I considered going to my mom\u2019s for support. I called her, crying, barely able to speak, and she immediately started talking about finances again. I lost it and sent this text: All week, you\u2019ve pushed to talk about finances because I was too sick for our meeting. I am still too sick. If you were this sick, you wouldn\u2019t want to discuss finances and feeling like a failure. If I kept pushing a topic you repeatedly asked me to drop, you would have a meltdown. I\u2019ve been actively breaking down for three days, yet you keep ignoring my boundaries. This is no longer concern\u2014it\u2019s blatant disrespect. I have so many texts where I\u2019ve politely asked you to stop, explaining that I cannot physically or mentally handle this while I am sick and miserable. Right now, I would rather be homeless than live in a house where my boundaries are ignored. This is so upsetting, and I needed to say it because you aren\u2019t listening. Goodnight. Was I too harsh?

To The point I couldn't leave the house alone became very depressed. It made me so delusional and like I was in a bubble. I didn't consider looking for work but I was quite adamant I'd go to university. But been rotting away at home on my second gap year.  However in these past few weeks I feel as if I'm snapping out of all of this and starting to realise that I may have used mental health as an excuse (I still have issues but I should've taken accountability), and maybe laziness is a factor. My depression and anxiety make me so irritable at my family my parents whove housed me and the fact they favour my little sister over me clearly (who is in still full time education), they tell me they can because she's actually doing something unlike me. Then I have thoughts that keep me up thinking what a disappointment I am considering all my parents have done for me they absolutely have all the right to favour my little sister.  I claim unemployment support and with saving that I've passed my car tests and now looking for a job which is very little progress but big for me considering I can't even leave the house without dying of anxiety. My parents see their friend's children and my dad bought up that his friend daughter who is a year older than me has a mortgage and is buying a house. (in this climate and accord to everyone my age that is kinda rare as its so hard to even find a job). I asked something and he misheard me saying so what and started shouting at me saying what have you done? You live off us? or something like that. I instantly burst into tears because I hate I let mental health hold me back so long. My mum said to my dad he shouldn't compare me to others because she knows someone who's daughter is a graduate, yet can't get a job also due to anxiety. The other day he told me that all I do is eat and sleep and shower which felt like an attack despite being the truth it hurts so bad because they've kinda codled me for years and now are finally making me see sense. I feel scared my parents even saying the truth of my life to me comparing me to others can trigger a depressive episode again. They are right by reminding me that I haven't achieved anything but I feel they are going about it the wrong way ",

        "selftext": "I have two children: Donna (21F) and Austin (19M). Both live at home but also stay on campus at their respective colleges. Austin has a girlfriend, Bridget, whom he\u2019s been dating for nearly a year. Early in their relationship, Bridget stayed over once while Donna was at school. With Donna\u2019s blessing, Bridget slept in Donna\u2019s room, and Austin stayed in his own. They chose to sleep separately, and there was no drama. This winter break, both kids were home. Toward the end of break, Bridget returned from out of state but couldn\u2019t move back into her dorm yet. Austin asked if she could stay with us for a few days. I agreed but mentioned we\u2019d need to figure out sleeping arrangements since we don\u2019t have a guest room\u2014just mine and my husband\u2019s room, Austin\u2019s, and Donna\u2019s. Austin said he and Bridget now share a bed, but his twin bed would be a tight fit. Donna has a full-sized bed, so I suggested Donna and Austin switch rooms temporarily. Donna could use Austin\u2019s bed, and Austin and Bridget would stay in hers. I assured Donna I\u2019d change the bedding afterward, but she was visibly upset and asked why Austin couldn\u2019t just sleep on the couch. I told her it was only for a few days, and since Austin wanted to share a bed with Bridget, this arrangement made sense. When Bridget arrived, everything seemed fine at first. That night, Bridget went to bed early, and Donna pulled Austin aside in the kitchen. I couldn\u2019t hear the start of their conversation, but Austin suddenly started yelling, \u201cShut up! Why would you say that?\u201d before storming into the living room. He loudly announced he\u2019d never invite Bridget back if \u201ceverything\u2019s such a problem.\u201d When I asked what happened, Austin explained that Donna asked him not to have sex with Bridget in her bed. He claimed he had no intention of doing that and accused Donna of being weird and trying to cause trouble. Donna said she had purposely tried to talk to Austin quietly to avoid a scene and hadn\u2019t said anything to Bridget. She also said it wasn\u2019t unreasonable to ask, given she knew Austin and Bridget were sexually active. I told Donna she didn\u2019t need to make such a big deal since I\u2019d already promised to wash the sheets. Donna became upset and ended up staying with a friend for the rest of break. School has since resumed, but Donna is barely responding to my calls or texts. Austin told me Bridget overheard the argument and now feels uncomfortable being in our house or around Donna. My husband said Austin caused the scene by yelling and pointed out that Donna wasn\u2019t out of line for making her request. He also said I should never have let Bridget stay in the first place.AITA? ",

Over the last year and a half, we\u2019ve had constant issues with and disagreements over communication and it\u2019s been having a very negative impact on our relationship. For context I am autistic, and she has been aware of this from the beginning of our relationship. She\u2019s knows that I have difficulty with implied meanings/hints/subtext, and to properly communicate with me effectively she needs to use clear unmistakable language. Last month we had another disagreement over a prior conversation we had via text. She claimed that she had asked in said conversation for me to go buy some groceries for a dinner we were planning to make together, and I told her that I would go to the grocery, but she never asked me before that moment. She got upset and repeated that she had, and I responded saying that we had the conversation via text and she in fact had not asked me. At that point she shut down and went to get the items herself.  Following this incident, we had another face to face conversation, and she mentioned showing the previous text conversation to her sister and a friend to see if she was in the wrong, and said they both agreed with her. I considered doing the same and asking my friends, but I know that they\u2019d just co-sign whatever I said, and so I\u2019m here with a throwaway for unbiased opinions.

I also play video games and some of these games involve a lot of clicking, like Monster Hunter, Marvel Rival, and League of Legends. My roommate is irritated with all the clicking and has asked me multiple times to just not play the games while she is in the room. Now I have made accommodations for her, like not playing games while she is doing schoolwork, not being on the phone while she is doing schoolwork, bought new headphones so I could speak quieter at night while on Discord with my buddies.  She still calls me inconsiderate and selfish for not ceasing the clicking while she is in the room because it bothers her and is super grating to hear She confronted me about it today and we got into an 'argument', but I told her I would not stop because I enjoy playing games. Some things that I do that I know are bad habits though, is I will lose track of time and stay up pretty late (12am EST at the latest) but I am not super loud, or yelling or anything past dark I have some screenshots that I am willing to share if I can  UPDATE: We have both said our arguments and apologized for our harsh words. We have come up with a compromise, we will keep our no games while studying and add on so that after 10-ish pm, I will not play the clicky games such as Rivals, League or Monster Hunter. We have also decided that if something else comes up, we will discuss it there and then instead of letting it fester and becoming a problem. Thank you guys for being so mean to me lol, it helped open my eyes and suck it up and talk to her.",

During year 8 our friend \u201cR\u201d was bullied by this girl relentlessly making her feel like she didn\u2019t even want to come to school. Which this bullying has stop due to \u201cR\u201d not being in the same class with \u201cA\u201d the bully anymore.  Fast forward to last year, my friend \u201cC\u201d got in \u201cA\u201d class and ended up becoming friends with her due to having no one else. Once this friendship came apparent to me, I quickly informed \u201cC\u201d about \u201cA\u201d past actions which she then proceeded to say \u201cshe isn\u2019t like that to me.\u201d Brushing it off basically. Despite how messed up that is I allowed them to continue their friendship without bothering them for about a year. Within that time \u201cA\u201d also wronged \u201cC\u201d by dragging her to a fight against her will causing \u201cC\u201d to take a break from their friendship. A few days ago \u201cC\u201d sent me a photo on Snapchat of her with \u201cA\u201d to which a responded \u201cOh! A Wow!\u201d My friend ended up crashing out on me saying stuff like she doesn\u2019t care and that \u201cA\u201d was helping her through stuff and being just bluntly rude towards me but the thing is I didn\u2019t even know they were friends again? So her yelling at me was uncalled for because I was saying it in a \u201cjoking way\u201d like oh that\u2019s awkward iykyk.  In these messages she continued to yell and argue with me, causing stuff over nothing practically. At one point to which I brought up in response to this ridiculousness I tried to explain to \u201cC\u201d since I had no update that \u201cA\u201d wronged her to which again cussed me out and said \u201cA\u201d was helping her through stuff. So at this point I was so annoyed because she was being unnecessarily rude to me, I said to her regardless of \u201cA\u201d making it up to her now she has still wronged her and our friend \u201cR\u201d in the past, and overall is a bad person despite her being a good friend momentarily. Responding to this \u201cC\u201d said she helping me through stuff\u201d completely ignoring her traumatising treatment to our good friend \u201cR\u201d. So I then called her out about this again completely ignoring this girls terrible actions.  Overall at the end of the fight, she ended it by saying that she would expose me to all her friends by talking bad about me to them and that she will block me if I don\u2019t shut up because she was having a \u201cbad\u201d day. I know she\u2019s going to paint herself as the victim as she\u2019s done previously multiple times in other arguments but I don\u2019t think having a bad day can justify this ignorant friendship.

For perspective; she was single for a whole TWO MONTHS once and was claiming no one loves her and she was worthless, life wasn't worth living alone, etc. Going extreme with it. Of course I told her all that wasn't true. Though at the same time I had no sympathy for her because I had been single for years. It was an unintentional, I hope, slap in the face to me. Well, she also had the habit of saying Every Single New Boyfriend makes me so happy! I really found the one! No one's ever made me feel like this before!  After boyfriend number 12 or so, I noticed the pattern.  She got with a guy, stayed with him for a year or more but then, out of nowhere, dumps him and gets with a new guy. Immediately moved in with new guy.  Not her typical move. When asked about it she claimed the last relationship was done long ago, and I morned it months ago. He had his chance to make things right. I finally spoke my mind on this. That she had essentially clung to the old boyfriend because she can't tolerate being single. Instead of ending the relationship and being on her own, she selfishly clung onto him until she found someone else to latch onto. She was offended by this. Claimed I should be happy for her because she's the happiest she's ever been. This new guy has his stuff together, has a car, has his own house. Treats her right for once. I tried to get her to recognize that she has said the same thing about Every new relationship. She somehow twisted this, claiming I said she was happy with her drug addicted ex (that had been, 5 boyfriends previously, I believe) No. When she first met that guy, she said the exact same things. But she's comparing the worst of that relationship with the start of this one. Ignoring the start of the previous one. I essentially told her what she did was wrong and that I don't approve of this decision of hers. I thought it was a bad move all around and worried she would end up in an even worse situation eventually. She twisted this into me wanting her to be miserable and alone.

I'll admit we were super young when we had her but I was in birth control which it didn't work in my favor. I have graduated with lots of vacational schools that still haven't leanded me a job but im working part time as a teacher. My bf in the other hand have been in college for about 4 years but kept switching so he just started his planned career a semester ago. To be exact he still have 3 years until he finish his school if he doesn't switch again. My issue is I just graduated as a phlebotomist but can't get a job so I wanted to join the army. As most know if you get married it's easier with the child and get help in the long runs my bf in the other hand doesn't want to get married instead stops me from going so I don't have to fight custody so my baby gets left with my mother. To be clear I been with him for 5 years. I know I might be young but hearing the words I don't want to marry you did hurt. My issue is AITAH for fighting custody of my daughter so I can join the military? Ps he doesn't work at all so I'm financially support my daughter n I live with my parents n he lives with his. He does come every two days to see his daughter but he is in the phone most of the time and yells at my baby a lot. I know going to a legal battle for my baby's custody would mean a end to the relationship but not sure if it's worth it anymore ? Help !!",

This year, as our sons are on the same team, I bought them each a game horn specifically for our games so we can be loud together (because we love to cheer our kids on and be loud together, as well as cheer for all the kids on the team). I bring my horn to every game and blow it every time someone scores and the kids love it! Not once have either of the two moms brought their horn and I've always wondered why? About a week ago, on our group chat I asked if they weren't going to use it to bring to the next game so my younger son can use it as he loves to blow the horn when someone scores. Neither of them brought it. It's not about the money because it was only around $12-$15 (each). I feel it is rude that they havent brought it to any game this season and we are nearing the end of the season. Nor, when I asked for my son to use one if they weren't going to, they still didnt give it back. Would I be the asshole if I asked for them back because they are not using them for what it was intended for?",

A few weeks ago she was leaving her gfs house when she fell down the stairs breaking three bones in the process including her ankle. My older sister and I rushed to support her as best as we could (getting her to and from the hospital, getting her teens to and from school, being there for surgery, etc.) About a week later she got into a huge argument with her gf and confided in me\u2026 in that moment I found out she was actually pushed down the stairs by her gf and that she lied to protect her. I was furious and told her to break things off because the relationship was toxic. She assured me she would, fast forward to yesterday I\u2019m at her home helping her with chores and in walks her gf a part of me knew she wasn\u2019t done but my heart was full of pain and anger.

        "selftext": "GF has had two jobs these past three years. First job was through a friend of her father and the second job, I took my lunch break to go with her to apply. I literally had to motivate her in the car before she got the courage to walk in and apply. She suffers from anxiety and just the thought of applying to jobs is anxiety inducing. I can't count the number of times I have sent her places to apply online or we are walking past a restaurant with a hiring sign and she says she wants to apply and never does. This past summer we went again to apply for restaurant jobs and she broke down crying in the car because she was so overwhelmed. On another date she eventually was able to apply to a few. I walked with her along the way and kept my distance when she went inside. Unfortunately she did not get a call back. Months ago she told me that there was a restaurant close to her school that she planned to apply to but hasn\u2019t to this day. She got into a very prestigious academic program a couple years ago. Before that however, she lied to me about applying for a different program for months and only told me when she couldn\u2019t lie anymore. Last year I met the owner of a top firm in the field my girlfriend is studying and bragged about her and asked if she could email the owner with the hopes of getting an internship. I had to craft the email for her and she sent it off. I asked her a week after if she heard anything back from the owner and she said no which I found strange. It was only months later while in casual conversation that she admitted that the owner did message her soon after her email and she missed it and she didn\u2019t want to tell me because she was embarrassed. An opportunity at my workplace came up recently. We have spoken in the past about her working there and she said yes she would be okay working there as the money and environment is good. We had not been speaking for a couple weeks due to an unrelated issue so I decided to apply for her. I created an email and crafted a cover letter and resume and applied. The manager replied offering her an interview and I sent a screenshot to her asking if she was still interested. She said yes but then accused me of \u2018violating\u2019 her by doing what I did and also wondering \u2018what I else I could send without her consent\u2019. She is framing it as creepy and alarming. I feel like if she didn\u2019t have that history, for sure you can make that case but for her to act like I did without acknowledging her anxiety and past actions is deceitful and victimizing herself unnecessarily. It really took me by surprise and did hurt because I saw it as dishonest to frame what I was doing as such a big violation when she knows there\u2019s a whole recent history of her not being able to get jobs without help and avoiding applying for jobs. She has asked me in the past to help her draft stuff for her and help in applying for jobs so her framing what I did as something completely out of left field is disappointing. AITA?--",

        "selftext": "Throw Away because I may be TA here.  The backstory is my brother-in-law (35m) lives a block away from my husband John (22m) and myself (22f). We will call the brother-in-law Billy. Billy is financially very stable. My husband John and I are not. Billy is John's half-sibling who was raised by his mother's side of the family. Billy's Mom passed away 5 years ago and left him a substantial inheritance. Billy didn't have a lot of contact with his dad's side of the family. Once his mother passed away he reached out to be closer to his dad and brother John.  John and I have known each other since 4th grade. We started dating around the 9th grade and got married last year. Billy has never liked that John and I are a couple. He feels like we should have waited to get married until we were more financially stable, finished college, and dated other people. John and I think he is projecting since he is the child of a broken home.  So Billy is constantly involving himself in our marriage. One way he does this is to stop by unannounced every day. He eats our food and tells me I am a horrible wife and a terrible woman for choosing school over being a wife and mother. He also constantly questions why we have no children yet. (Because we can barely feed ourselves and are still in school.) Anyway, you get the idea; Billy is not a nice person to us, but he is family.  The reason I may be TA is before Winter Break I was up early and desperately searching for something to eat, like I said we are starving college students. Billy knows we are struggling and does nothing to help us out, but he continues to show up for every meal. On this particular morning, I found a half jar of peanut butter and some old packages of instant oatmeal in the cabinet. Like clockwork, here comes Billy waddling in for a free meal. I was stressed, about to take my finals that day, and worried my husband and I would not have enough nourishment to get through them. So I grabbed the jar of peanut butter and dumped 2 heaping spoonfuls into the pot. Billy is allergic to peanuts and he freaks out yelling that I am trying to kill him. Now he has the whole family believing I hate him and tried to murder him on purpose. Even John is saying it would have been a rough day but it would have been easier than to deal with this backlash. AITA here? EDIT: I am adding this edit to clarify that I did not try to feed the oatmeal to Billy. I added to the pot so he couldn't have any. That probably makes me an even bigger AH. It was a moment of weakness. EDIT 2: I want to say thank you to everyone for your feedback. John and I are going to take much of the advice. This has been very hard for us and we did need to hear some of this feedback. Thank you all for helping us get over our first hurdle as a married couple. ",

It was pouring outside and I noticed I forgot my umbrella so I peaked into the room and saw that there was a class in there and left again. Then I looked at the clock and saw I would have to wait 30 minutes so I decided to quickly just grab it as to not disturb the class. So I went into the room, walking into the direction of my umbrella and the teacher was aggressively asking  what are you doing here?! (was machst du hier?!) and I said I just forgot my umbrella and proceeded to get it and walked back into the direction of the door. While walking back he was aggressively saying something like du bist unm\u00f6glich!! You are impossible!! (idk if thats right, maybe you already guessed i'm not pretty good at english x3) and that caused me to feel personally attacked, so my fight or flight (kind of more like fight AND flight at this point) I talked back like you are just as impossible and idk what he said then but he kept on looking down on me so much, like I wasnt a human. I pulled myself together and answered yeah yeah instead of starting a fight) and slammed the door shut. I usually dont get aggressive with anyone but this guy just triggered me so much with how he was acting like he is the most important ever and how dare I disturb his lesson. He probably expected me to knock and be like Sorry to disturb your class, I forgot my umbrella and wait for his permission to get it, when this would interrupt the class way more than just grabbing it. And also he was the one making all of this into a scene by being angry at me in the first place.. a normal person could have just said nothing or if they are really bothered sth like knock next time but no.. like ok I wasnt really the most polite either and shouldnt have talked back so probably I am the asshole and should be kicked from school for this right?

Basically, me and my friends had been planning to go out to lunch during one of the weekends and we had been planning this for about two weeks. When the day rolls around, I ended having to be taken there by my grandma and at the time, my cousin was with my grandma also. I was running a bit late but while we\u2019re riding in the car, my grandma brings up that I\u2019m going out to eat and decides to ask me if my cousin can come, I ended up saying sure and gave my friends a heads up that my cousin was coming although there was a bit a protest from them, there was nothing I could do because I didn\u2019t wanna tell her no and my cousin doesn\u2019t really have a lot of friends and we have always bit sort of close. So we get to the restaurant and things go as they should, my cousin doesn\u2019t really talk to anyone besides me and isn\u2019t bothering anyone, she just eats and pays for her own food as everyone does. Today my friend text me telling me that he thought it was really weird that I invited my cousin to a gathering that was for friends and something we had been planning for a while. I blew this off because I didn\u2019t see it as that big a deal but he told me he was serious and asked why I would invite her, I told him that there was no harm in it and that she minded her own business the entire time. He protested and told me that wasn\u2019t the point and it was mainly the fact that I invited her without consulting anyone else and as I said before we were literally in the car on the way to the restaurant when \u201cI invited\u201d her. He then thought it would be good to say \u201cns idk why ur gma even let her go she knew it was like a friend thing\u201d and to me this sounded so stupid because my grandma obviously didn\u2019t see any harm in inviting her and was only trying to help my cousin out. Of course I understand where he\u2019s coming from but she literally sat there and did nothing but eat and talk to me and he\u2019s complaining now? Mind you this happened months ago.

We broke up a couple of times and came back together because I refused to let go and held on to him.Anyways, the last time we came back together before he proposed, I kind of pushed for it but it seemed like he felt what he had been doing was wrong and he said he was willing to change. Fast forward to getting married and living together, I contribute financially to the household. We both do. I do the cooking and the cleaning. He helps out with cleaning when he can. Sometimes when I clean he feels it's not up to his standard and starts cleaning again. Fair enough. A couple of days ago, the laundry was full and he put it in the washer and then asked why I didn't, then I said I was going to do it later. He then said, why didn't I do it then. I didn't say anything. We went to bed without speaking and on my way to work the next day, he called me after v texted during the night that I didn't th.. it's fair that he makes it out as if I don't do anything in the house. I then went on to say, I'm the one washing the toilets, doing the vacuum and although he puts the clothes in the washer, I have to pop them in the dryer and always did that and fold them back into the closet. He then went on to say it's not that I don't do them but I do them on my own time. But whose time would I do them on? I'm working. I do the chores on my off days cause I know that's when I'm free to cook and do cleaning.Then I said he should not help again then if he is going to keep complaining about the fact that he helps in the house and I told him to fuck off. Yeah maybe I was wrong for telling him to get off the phone but I think it's unfair to tell me to do the chores on his own time considering we both work.

My cars older than i am, i\u2019m currently unemployed, i still live at home, i don\u2019t ever plan on having kids, and i\u2019m very depressed but she recently said she was done asking and is going to \u201cmatch my energy\u201d. but if i barely have the energy to keep myself going day to day how am i supposed to give her any ? especially considering her kids are only 2 and newborn it feels so overwhelming. I have very specific reasons for not wanting kids that makes me struggle to connect with them even if they\u2019re family. i even struggle to connect with my sister sometimes because we don\u2019t have any similar interests. its hard to make conversation and it feels awkward and it shouldn\u2019t be that way around family. this is NOT a political discussion but we do have wildly different opinions as well. i\u2019m the younger sibling and i just don\u2019t see how it\u2019s my responsibility drive there when she also moved 20 minutes away. This isn\u2019t really important but she also asks me last minute a lot so I have to say no because i haven\u2019t done anything productive that day. I still love my sister more than anything but i just wish she could see how things are from my side. i\u2019m really hurt that she resorted to just cutting me off without even thinking that i might be going through something. as i slightly mentioned I\u2019ve been open with her about my struggles and how I don\u2019t mean to be distant i\u2019m just constantly being set back in life this might lean you closer to i\u2019m the asshole but i also don\u2019t have plans to try and fix it. i\u2019m not saying i want it to be like this forever but i know it\u2019ll be hard for her to forgive me (if she does) i don\u2019t believe anyone is \u201cright\u201d in this situation but i do think i\u2019m not entirely at fault here.",

        "selftext": "This is my first year at a new school, and I\u2019ve already found myself in a mess. Antoine wasn\u2019t just another classmate\u2014he was more like a random guy I went to school with, someone I somehow got lucky enough to get close to. Rae, on the other hand, quickly became one of my closest friends. As the weeks went by, I started catching feelings for Antoine. Rae knew I liked him because I told her. What I didn\u2019t know was that Antoine had liked Rae since before the school year started. Rae said she wasn\u2019t interested, but in November, that changed. She started pulling away from me and getting closer to him. It hurt to see, so I begged her not to do anything with him\u2014not until I could get over my feelings. Rae promised she wouldn\u2019t, and I trusted her. But after Antoine got his phone back during a trip, I found out Rae had been calling him and having intimate conversations. I was devastated. I begged her to stop, and she promised it wouldn\u2019t happen again. For a while, I thought things were fine. But right before Christmas, I found out Rae had given Antoine a blow job\u2014and that they started dating that same day. I was crushed. I wanted them to break up, and the next day, they did\u2014because of me. Rae said she ended it for my sake, but it just made things messier. After the breakup, Rae admitted she never actually loved Antoine, which made me feel worse. Antoine was already going through a lot, and knowing Rae didn\u2019t truly care for him hurt me even more. Things between the two of them haven\u2019t been the same since, though I feel like I\u2019ve been getting closer to Antoine. As for Rae, I\u2019m still upset. She broke my trust twice, and when she said she didn\u2019t regret it, it cut even deeper. I want to forgive her someday, but I don\u2019t know how to let go of the pain she caused me. Am I wrong for not being able to move on? Should I try harder to forgive Rae, or is it okay to walk away when trust is broken?",

        "selftext": "So my bsf and I have both had pretty shitty weeks, her favorite grandparent died and due to a domino effect I almost had a mental breakdown. When her grandma died I asked if she wanted to talk about it and then she said no. That night the first thing that triggered my almost breakdown happened. For some context, what happened to me doesn\u2019t seem like a big deal to people outside of my family due to other issues I have. I know bsf can shut down emotionally when something goes wrong and I just wanted to talk to her about it. I sent her a video of what was going on because I miss her and I felt like I was drowning. Then Friday I sent her a snap joking that I really hate myself this week cause I\u2019m restarting a paper. She then posted on her story how she didn\u2019t want to hear about other peoples weeks cause she was just pissed off cause her grandma died. Understandable and I feel really guilty cause I felt like I wasn\u2019t thinking about that. So I sent her a message saying I was really sorry and I just needed to talk to someone about what was going on with me, and I wasn\u2019t thinking about her feelings and we both apologized for the past week She\u2019s now leaving me open on snap which is not something we do and I\u2019m worried I did something wrong cause even though I\u2019m away from having that full on breakdown I\u2019m still mentally fragile right now and I\u2019m anxious about everything.  I don\u2019t know how to talk to her about it if she doesn\u2019t wanna even talk to me about it.",

        "selftext": "AITA for telling my girlfriend my friend said she was ugly? I\u2019ll be as honest as I can because i genuinely want to know what people think or if we\u2019re just overreacting. Keep in mind everyone in this story is 17-18. I was at a party with my friend, and he made a remark that my girlfriend was ugly. He was just like \u201cwell she\u2019s ugly anyways\u201d. He says things like this a lot and dismisses them as jokes. I can\u2019t remember too much from the party since I was a little drunk but from what I can remember she was brought up and he said it. We weren\u2019t even talking about her negatively or positively she just happened to be part of the conversation. Anyways, when I\u2019m home I\u2019m on call with her and I tell her he was saying stuff which kind of pissed me off and I was a bit stressed. She asked what and I told her what he said. Admittedly I do kind of regret telling her since if one of her friends called me ugly I probably wouldn\u2019t be too happy and this could have saved a lot of drama. But she was very much not happy with him. She\u2019d told lots of her friends about the situation and one of which is friends with my friend.  Now the next day at work me and my friend were talking and my girlfriend came up, and I told him that she really didn\u2019t like him anymore. This led to him finding out I told her. I can\u2019t even really describe his reaction. It was like angry and confused and bewildered. He told me I shouldn\u2019t have told her that and that I\u2019m useless and she\u2019s being too oversensitive and that he only said it as a joke. To add to that last part he said he\u2019s always thought she\u2019s good for me and good looking. But I don\u2019t know why he\u2019d just say she\u2019s ugly. It isn\u2019t even funny. No one even laughed at it. Like why would you joke about that.  That last part is important because like I said earlier he says lots of stuff as a \u201cjoke\u201d and never knows when he\u2019s crossed a line. And since one of his friends is friends with my girlfriend too, they\u2019ve been talking about it and he\u2019s lost a friend because their mutual friend sided with her. So he isn\u2019t too happy with me. He says he\u2019s mad at me because I told her and he\u2019s mad at my girlfriend for being too sensitive.  Finally today we had a talk about it and I told him that she has every right to be upset and he really shouldn\u2019t joke about this stuff because it isn\u2019t funny and just degrading towards her. He never actually apologised.  I do feel a bit awful because I caused quite a bit of drama, we didn\u2019t have a big argument at work but it was quite a heated conversation and now there\u2019s rumours going round saying we\u2019ve had some massive argument. I feel like in some way we\u2019re both in the wrong.  And by the way, obviously my girlfriend is not ugly. This isn\u2019t even just my opinion it\u2019s fact. I\u2019m very proud to say in the time I\u2019ve been dating her I\u2019ve never heard a single bad remark about her other than this.  TLDR: I told my girlfriend my friend said she was ugly, he found out and was mad about that. ",

        "selftext": "So it goes like this: my sister is getting married in five months. Her fianc\u00e9 doesn\u2019t have enough friends to fill out his grooms party. Instead of approaching me directly, he just showed up at my house a couple times that I wasn\u2019t available. My dad told me on accident that the reason is he wants me to be part of one of his groomsmen. This kind of pissed me off because he could have called me, texted me, something to let me know he was stopping by. I hate when people show up unannounced. I work at night and sleep in the day.Not only that, but they\u2019ve been dating for like two or three years, and I barely know the guy. He hasn\u2019t really done anything to try to build a friendship with me. He sits at home and plays RuneScape all the time. Isn\u2019t his groom party supposed to be the man in his life that he can depend on to back him up during his marriage? Is it not a massive red flag that he doesn\u2019t have any fucking friends and is a total social loser? Why should I have to plug in because he can\u2019t get off the computer and go make some? Don\u2019t get me wrong, he\u2019s done a lot of good for my sister, and he\u2019s good with things like using tools.. but am I wrong in that if he wants me to be one of his groomsmen that the reason should be because we have a bond, not just because he doesn\u2019t have enough friends to fill the spot? Should it not be a big red flag to everyone that this guy doesn\u2019t have friends..? I\u2019d rather not have more responsibilities during this familial obligation. She already wanted me to take photos. How am I supposed to do that if I\u2019m part of the party?  She is my older sister, but her fianc\u00e9 is younger than me. Maybe I should be the one to initiate some time for us to hang out? But to be honest, I don\u2019t care. I\u2019m single, have my own busy life, and feel like if this guy wants me to be close to him, he needs to man up and reach out to me. Tonight I get a text message that says to give him a call when I can. I barely know this guy. I really don\u2019t wanna do it, but I also want my sister to be happy. My family all know I\u2019m outspoken and opinionated. I\u2019m not a fan and his approach to asking me is just making it worse. UPDATE: Okay MIATA.. Spoke to my sister.. he doesn\u2019t have friends and this is her idea. I don\u2019t have to take a lot of photos because they have someone doing basic photos included. I\u2019ll do it, but i\u2019m going to invite him out to get a drink or something first so that a bachelor\u2019s party isn\u2019t the first time hanging out.  Damn, doesn\u2019t it say don\u2019t downvote AHs? \ud83e\udd23 \ud83d\udd95\ud83c\udffd ",

        "selftext": "So I have been with my partner for many years and during the start of our relationship I found out he is related to a new friend of mines from university as we were on the same course. I also found out his family and her family were not close anymore due to a family argument a few years back. Since I have been friends with my friend I haven\u2019t been able to talk to her ever about my partner or his family etc given she may go and tell her family. This over the years put a strain on my side of the friendship as I could never share things openly with my friends (we are a trio) and always had to hide stuff even things that may have been upsetting me in the worry that she may go and tell her family or mum. She is very close to her mum and shares many things with her, she also does have a loud mouth in general so I was always cautious of what I was or wasn\u2019t saying.  Fast forward to today, me and my partner live with his parents who are my in laws now. Due to the home we may not be able to stay long term due to wanting to start our own family and space etc. we discussed that we would maybe move out later if we had to but he would speak to his parents to kind of give them a heads up in the next few months.  I have been speaking to my friends in general about my situation and didn\u2019t explicitly say we are definitely moving but said it is something we are considering and thinking about due to family planning and we may have to do it.  I was talking to my friends and my husband leaned over and saw my friend casually showing me a home on sale because it is something we have talked about here and there as the time is slowly approaching for family planning and also house buying is a long process.  My husband then got upset at me saying why did I tell my friends and I said why not. He then said what if she (his relative) goes and tells her family and they tell his family (parents) before we have even told them. I got mad and said why can I not talk to my friends I never said we are definitely going but that we are considering. He continued to then say if something does come out we will deal with it at that time. He then said you won\u2019t be friends with her (background: I agreed should she cause any harm in our marriage then I would stop talking to her) . I got mad and started saying you can\u2019t tell me not to be friend with her etc, unless you\u2019re telling me this is something you\u2019re going to divorce me over. He then said how is it going to look if they find out from someone else or that we didn\u2019t tell them ourself.  I then said something along the lines you\u2019re just saying this because your upset your parents are going to cry some tears if they found out. Which he then got really upset about with me and told me I have upset him. I didn\u2019t respond after that and the conversation of the topic ended.  AITA for saying this to my husband as I feel like I am justified in saying this as I don\u2019t think it is that deep if my friend did tell her family and his parents found out earlier because we haven\u2019t made any moves to actually move, look actively for homes or even 100% know that we are going. We are also in a position where we likely will have to leave due to space capacity so it is an obvious thing I am sure they are thinking of or aware of ",

For a while now she\u2019s been living off her kids and bullying my gf and today I had enough of the stupid shit. Me and her brother went to the lake today to kick it and talk. While there he smokes his weed. I don\u2019t smoke so I didn\u2019t hit the blunt. When getting back to the house I make sure I spray well. (Note he didn\u2019t spray at all.)  As we come in she says \u201c I better not smell shit.\u201d She comes out the bathroom and starts cusssing at me saying \u201c I\u2019m sick of that fucking smell this ain\u2019t no fucking weed house tf are you doing . ( note my gfs mom didn\u2019t apologize for shit and never thinks she\u2019s wrong.\u201d) I don\u2019t say anything and I go upstairs . SHE COMES ALL THE WAY FROM DOWNSTAIRS  banging on my gfs dooor saying it smells like weed and I\u2019m so sick of this shit cussing at me and my gf. ( note again, she lives with her 7 kids and they all split EVERY SINGLE BILL TOGETHER  that  still includes rent which is 680$ per person. ATP your kids aren\u2019t living with you yall are roommates. She goes on to say I don\u2019t say anything bc yall (gf and her brothers and sisters) pay bills and I say \u201cwell it doesn\u2019t feel like it I feel like it\u2019s fair game if everyone split bills evenly ( she drinks beer like it\u2019s fucking water. I truly think she\u2019s an alcoholic.) she then starts cussing at me and I start cussing back saying who tf are you talking to get tf out my face with that stupid shit basically telling her about her self. Apart me feels like I overreacted but also another part of me is like \u201c you don\u2019t let nobody disrespect you.\u201d So am I the asshole ?  Edit: Also her friends smoke weed religiously. When they come inside they literally smell like a TREE. They even roll up in the house in front of the kids when they get done smoking you can literally smell it upstairs. They don\u2019t spray or anything . Gfs mom never says anything to them about their smell",

        "selftext": "I, a 24 yo female, have been engaged to my husband for around a year now. We have a seemingly perfect relationship. We split bills properly, care for eachother, and have a good intimate life. This all started around a couple weeks ago, and I am still trying to process this situation and figure out if I am in the wrong or not.  A couple weeks prior to this taking place, me and my fianc\u00e9e were moving my things into his apartment, since it's a more spacious place, and ironically, it's closer to my workplace than my old apartment. Now here's where the trouble begins.  I am a cleanfreak. I need everything to be clean and orderly no matter where I am. That is just how I was raised because my mother has the same tendencies. We were cleaning out his room to make space for the new bed we bought, along with my other necessities I brought along with me. As we were moving out his old twin size bed, I found a tupperware container underneath the bed. It wasn't marked, nor did he tell me what it was. I assumed it was old food left under his bed since the container was foggy, so I marched to the kitchen to throw it out. Later that night, he began frantically looking for something. When I asked what he was looking for, he said he was looking for his moms ashes. I offered to help because that's what any normal person would do, and that's when the search began. I asked him what the urn looked like that he kept her in, and what he said next made my stomach drop. He said she was in a tupperware container due to the fact that he still couldn't come to terms with her passing (this was two years ago that she passed).  I turned pale, and when I told him I threw them away, he lost his mind. The story could've ended there having found them, but the only problem was, the garbage truck had already came to pick up the garbage we threw away.  Long story short, after a big argument, I am staying at my moms and my fianc\u00e9e has ceased all contact with me for the time being. I feel horrinle, but also, who keeps their moms ashes in a tupperware container?! Am I The Asshole? ",

I tried to get up quick and shoot out ahead of people but had a guy stand up and block me very purposefully saying he also had a flight, then proceeded to stand there and willingly let the isle fill up to let everyone in front of him go ahead even though half the isle was empty in front of him at the beginning. He didn\u2019t even move to grab his stuff. I stayed quiet. I was unhappy and frustrated but didn\u2019t say anything. Didn\u2019t even glare. I frowned, cause that was a dick move. But I just bounced anxiously hoping things went quick.  Another passenger sitting in a row near me got my attention and said, \u201chey, we\u2019re all late for our connecting flights so maybe be respectful.\u201d  \u2026. \ud83d\ude21I frowned and took a breath. I looked at him and said very politely, \u201cI am being respectful. I\u2019m not yelling or cursing or asking people to move. I\u2019m not screaming or whining that I\u2019m gonna miss my flight. Nor am I giving anyone dirty looks. I\u2019m standing here being as patient as possible because I understand that.\u201d  Which believe me was a feat considering I had barely just taken my anxiety pills for the day, not that they needed to know that. \ud83d\ude12 It felt like I was being chastised by a stranger for being anxious and showing a modicum of emotion. I was quiet, obviously annoyed but not directing it towards anyone or anything. I don\u2019t think I was being disrespectful. Yes I was trying to jump ahead because my next flight was supposed to be boarding. Was it rude to try and get off before others who had time between their flights? Was it disrespectful simply because I was the last row in the plane and should wait seated for everyone else to off board and potentially miss my flight because others weren\u2019t moving without a sense of urgency? Or was it the emotional distress I was showing that was disrespectful part? AITA?  If so I humbly accept the title, but if I am, why so I can understand. If I should wait patiently in my seat I can do that.  EDIT: I will accept that I am the AH. Thank you. I will stay seated next time and let the flight attendants know about my tight connecting flight. I really didn\u2019t know I could/should do that. I do know I was not the only person with connecting flights that may be tight and I should have realized that. I will do better next time thank you.",

I quit my \u201ccareer\u201d job, packed all of my belongings up, and shoved as much as I could in my car and drove over 800 miles to a new destination I had only visited for a week a few months prior (and fell in love with). I was living with my parents (technically my Great Aunt (72F) and Uncle(74M), but for this we\u2019ll just say my parents) and looking for a place to move out to anyways, and it was time for a change in scenery.  Anyways, the only thing I wasn\u2019t able to grab before I left for this life changing trip was my medication. I\u2019m very fortunate that I don\u2019t have to take anything SUPER serious (no controlled substances), but the meds I DO take tend to have serious side effects if you just stop taking them. Well, since I quit my job, my insurance stopped at some point. Also, of course, my last batch of meds were ready the day after I packed up my car and drove halfway across the states. Before that point, I asked my friend - we\u2019ll call her Janet(30F) - to pick up my them up for me if she could and send them my way.  She did, and then proceeded to hold onto them for a month and a half. In fact, I was under the impression she picked up ALL of my meds - because I had put in an order for all of my meds - but she didn\u2019t even check to let me know. I had to constantly text and remind her to send them my way because I was slowly running out of my medication and getting closer and closer to having to start withdrawing from them\u2026which I never want to do without the help of a PCP or psych by my side (which I didn\u2019t have at the moment because I JUST moved to a new area and lost my insurance). By the end of the month and a half, I had to get another friend to send them for me (who did it immediately without any trouble).  Something I didn\u2019t realize is that technically sending medication in the mail is frowned upon, according to google, at least. And as Janet so kindly reminded me, after a month and a half, she worked at UPS and let me know that they had constant drug dogs checking packages and scanners for the boxes to run through. But my boyfriend told me he had his meds shipped by his mom for years before across state lines without issues, and another friend of ours\u2019 dad actually worked at USPS and he himself would ship out their meds pretty regularly for years as well. So if Janet just didn\u2019t put a return address and didn\u2019t mention what was being shipped, what was the big issue?  Am I going crazy? Am I the asshole here? Am I just a doormat?",

        "selftext": " I made plans with my wife and two friends to have them over for dinner and games on Saturday. Basically it was a double date. I bought new controllers and the newest version of Mario Party so we could all play together. In the morning I cooked and prepped a meal to serve the four of us and left it in the crock pot to cook for 7 hours. Then my wife and I left to visit my nephew who had just made it out of the ICU. I had given my friends a time frame between 5-9pm to come over. We ended up staying at the hospital until 5. The friends (which are a couple) called to let us know they were there at 5. They didn't let us know they were on the way over so we couldnt intercept them and let them know we weren't home yet. My wife told them we would be back in a half hour. They have the code to our home so they could have gone in and sat to wait, but I think they just sat in the driveway for almost an hour. The traffic coming back was horrible. They texted us at 5:45 and said we left. Going on a date instead. And then did not respond to us after that. They're obviously pissed that we were late and maybe feel like their time was disrespected. I told them I was sorry I didn't communicate that we were out and that I wished they could have tried the food at least. My wife offered for them to come back after their date to eat with us but they declined.  I feel like we were both in the wrong here by not communicating our locations. I understand we were late to our own party, but that's why I gave the wide range of 5-9pm. I'm just waiting now to let them cool off and see if they eventually respond to my apology. I felt really dissapointed/sad that I had all this food and my fun night with friends was cancelled, and I'm sure they felt bored and annoyed as they waited.  ********Update********I called both of them individually and told them I was sorry for disrespecting their time. They were both understanding and forgiving. I lost track of time when I was at the hospital because my nephew was starting to walk and talk again after a near death illness. I should have texted them while I was there but didn't realize until it was too late. Neither did my wife. I felt defensive and disappointed that they did their own thing and hoped they would have texted before coming over. I told them a time and they came during that time so they are at no fault here.

Because I planned on going to the botanical gardens to propose but leading up to this she kept finding a way to make up every time we\u2019d go some where that I would propose to her. So I made up that we were going to the gardens to a flower event which obviously led up to the proposal. I tried to keep it a secret but even that is considered dishonesty.  Edit- I can imagine if I wouldn\u2019t have even mentioned the cheating aspect that it was a proposal and she insisted it was a dishonest proposal because I had to embellish the truth to get to the proposal or else the surprise and the intention to make a moment out of it would have been nothing. Should have just propose at the grocery store.  The cheating was with someone that was a stalker that constantly texted me to the point that it was a daily, weekly and monthly occurrence. They found out during an accidental screenshot of a text conversation. But I get it you hear cheating and it is taken in the worst light.",

        "selftext": "I (35M) have a friend, Steve (48), who accidentally got Stephanie (44) pregnant about a decade ago, and they now have a daughter, Chloe (9). I met Steve last year at a park while walking my dog, and we became friends since he lives nearby and also has a dog. Steve\u2019s a good guy who cares deeply about his daughters (he has three adult daughters from another relationship). Whenever I\u2019m with Steve and Stephanie calls, she often seems ridiculous. Sometimes she calls over minor things; other times, she\u2019s frantic, like she\u2019s on the verge of a breakdown. She\u2019s a helicopter parent and very possessive of Chloe. Stephanie doesn\u2019t let Chloe visit Steve alone. The first time Steve ever took Chloe anywhere without her was recently\u2014and only because one of his adult daughters went with them to a movie. Steve said Stephanie blew up Chloe's phone the entire time. Steve wanted to teach Chloe to ski, but Stephanie told him it wasn\u2019t appropriate for a 9-year-old and that he needed to find a better activity. Every idea Steve has for activities gets shut down with an excuse. Despite this, Stephanie often makes passive-aggressive comments like, \u201cCome over here and be a dad,\u201d even though Steve gives her at least $250 a month (voluntarily, no court order) and spends multiple evenings a week at her place to be with Chloe as that's Stephanie's idea of visitation. She makes it seem like he isn't a good father or something when it is\u00a0**she**\u00a0that doesn't really let Chloe hang out with friends,\u00a0**she**\u00a0that bought Chloe a smartphone due to her incessant need to always be able to contact her,\u00a0**she**\u00a0who isolates Chloe from Steve's side of the family and\u00a0**she**\u00a0who is always worrying about making rent, yet only has a part-time job and spends money that should be going towards other things on weed. When Steve brought up to Stephanie that he thought that 9 is way too young to have a smartphone, his concerns were all ignored. When he brought up that he doesn't like Chloe being around her when she is smoking weed due to secondhand smoke, the issue was disregarded. Recently, Stephanie moved, and I helped Steve while she mostly stood around watching. Her place looked like it was recently featured on *Hoarders*. That day, Stephanie took Chloe to the ER for **the flu** as Urgentcare won't see her without insurance. Later, I told Steve about the Affordable Care Act and how he could get insurance for himself and Chloe. The next day, Steve asked Stephanie for Chloe\u2019s social security number to enroll her, and Stephanie freaked out, saying, I don't even give Chloe's SSN to the state! She claimed Chloe was already insured and when asked by Steve who the insurer was, she mumbled something vague. I directly asked, \u201cWho is she insured through then?\u201d and Stephanie snapped, yelling, \u201cWE ARE HER PARENTS!\u201d When we left, Steve said, \u201cSee what I\u2019m dealing with? How she snapped at you?\u201d I replied that she had a point\u2014it\u2019s not really my business. What do you think? Was I an asshole for asking who insures her child? EDIT: I wanted to add that I have already advised him to get an attorney. He mentioned once that his brother is in huge debt over attorney fees to get time with his own daughter. I let him know that many attorneys will work with you and let you pay in monthly installments and he was very receptive. I was going to include that in the original post but was limited to 3000 characters. Why he hasn't done this already? I don't know, I mean I certainly would have long ago. Also that about $250 is in addition to him paying a big portion of her rent every month. SECOND EDIT: Wanted to add that I agree that my buddy should have taken care of this sooner. He stopped smoking weed shortly after I met him and has gotten and new job and is getting his life together, but Stephanie has made not made it easy for him to be a good dad by alienating Chloe from him and his side of the family. Her need for control is so great that she won't allow Steve to spend time with the child alone, and she wouldn't give the SSN to Steve because she perceives it as getting one over on her. When Steve asked her for the SSN so he could insure Chloe at **no cost to her** she should be happy to oblige, not adversarial. She isn't working at co-parenting and **he clearly is.** As far as child support what more should he be doing? He already pays a big portion of the rent and whenever she calls him for money, he never says no or doesn't give her money when she asks so I'm not sure what more he should be doing. ",

        "selftext": "So i(18f) have some friends, the ones related to the conflict are: \u201cAiden\u201d, \u201dAbby\u201d and \u201cJane\u201d. The ones that aren\u2019t directly in the conflict but need a name are: \u201cRose\u201d, and \u201cDan\u201d. (All are assorted 18f or 18m). More relevant context: Aiden and Abby are dating and tend to share the same brain cell as wells fan the others flames (in the sense of causing them to be more angry) So last week I was making brownies for myself. I never bake so I decided to send a picture of the brownies to my group chat with a bunch of my friends. Abby responded with \u201cmmm I really wish I had brownies\u201d. I\u2019m a sarcastic person so I\u2019m response I said \u201cwhy do you think I made them\u201d. Dan answered my question like it was literal, so i explained that I was being sarcastic and I meant it as \u201cI\u2019m making the brownies because I was brownies too\u201d. So Aiden then messages being like \u201cwell are you going to mail her some?\u201d(I\u2019m currently on the other side of the country) And I said \u201cnah, she can bake her own brownies\u201dI didn\u2019t feel like it was too much to ask because brownies are pretty easy to make. All of a sudden Aiden was saying that I was being harsh, then Abby joined in saying that I was being rude. I tried to explain that I just felt like brownies weren\u2019t that hard to make, and I said that if Aiden wanted her to have brownies so bad then he could make them for her. They got more upset with me for that. Then Abby sends me a message saying that she didn\u2019t appreciate how I was treating her Aiden or Dan.Aiden chimes in saying it\u2019s rude to bake something and not at least say \u201ci would offer you some if you were here\u201d At this point I felt like it was inappropriate to address this in the group chat with what I thought was 5 people that had nothing to do with this. So I chose to not answer the messages and hoped they would message me privately to figure it out. Rose calls me later and tells me that despite saying nothing to me Jane is also upset. She was telling me that they were talking shit about me in a group chat I\u2019m not in.The thing that made me the most upset was that they were saying things like \u201csomeone call her so she can\u2019t escape it.\u201d, \u201cShe\u2019s being such an asshole\u201d, \u201cher boyfriend is influencing her.\u201d. Obviously it hurt to see this side of my friends. I deleted social media and ignored all their messages. Am I the asshole for this situation? Update: A bit after I posted this I did try to speak with them, however it didn\u2019t go great and they didn\u2019t like or listen to what I had to say. it essentially dragged out more of the situation with \u201cDan\u201d to which I countered that how I treat him he\u2019s fine with (him and I act like siblings in the way of like making jabs at each other) and that if he isn\u2019t fine with it he lets me know. I\u2019m still annoyed that they might\u2019ve thrown away our friendship over brownies. Dan, Rose and 2 others from the group are all still on good terms and are somewhat trying to help defuse the situation and all admit it\u2019s stupid. So this is snowballing and I\u2019m just gonna ignore them for a while :)",

        "selftext": "Sorry if this is long, trying to paint the full picture here. My ex (33F) and I (32M) have a son (8M) together. Other than the odd disagreement we have coparented very well for quite a few years now. We have an agreement in place but it\u2019s flexible. We sit together at his sports, I go over there to play with him when it\u2019s not my designated time, we do holidays together, you get the idea. My son plays hockey and it\u2019s become his whole identity, it\u2019s all he wants to do ever. I grew up playing hockey and his mom is not sporty in the slightest, so it\u2019s something that him and I bond over and he is always asking for me to play with him. Thursday night after his practice he asked both his mom and I if I could come play with him in the basement after his game today (he has a set up in his basement at his moms with a full sized net and sheets of fake ice). We both have the okay and all was good. At the game today I told her that the outdoor rinks were finally good quality and ready (we are Canadian eh) so I was going to take him out to do that instead. She was fine with it, and he looked like a kid at Christmas when I told him. After his game we went straight there and played for 2 hours. He then told me he was hungry (after playing hockey for 3 hours straight no doubt). Important to note that this kid gives no warning, he goes from fine to starving in 3.2 seconds and has an utter meltdown like he hasn\u2019t eaten in 6 years every time. It\u2019s a known thing and a running joke between all friends and family. We were much closer to my place and I had not been given a time to have him home or mention of plans so we went back to my place to I could make him dinner quick before I took him back to his mom. I got a text from her as we were eating, she was planning on ordering them pizza and wanted to know how much longer we would be. When I told her we were eating already and I would drop him off soon she got extremely snippy with me, essentially telling me that I was stealing her time and that if I did that to her I would be pissed, it went on and on especially because I honestly can\u2019t figure out what the issue was. Should I have checked in and seen if she had plans? Maybe. Should she have said she had dinner plans for them? Also maybe. But she told me it wasn\u2019t about the food, it was about \u2018me stealing time from her\u2019. From the time we left his game to the time I dropped him off, fed, was less than 3 hours. Am I really the asshole here?",

        "selftext": "I\u2019m friends with an elderly woman who has no kids and no family here.  She does have a male friend (boyfriend or something to that nature) that helps her with rides and shopping, but doesn\u2019t live with her.  We talk sporadically, once or twice every two weeks.  I\u2019ve tried to help her with shopping or taking her to appointments but she refuses.  She has had ongoing heart and diabetic issues for a year and a half now.  In the beginning when she was getting a procedure done for heart she wouldn\u2019t let me take her or stay with her.   But I went anyways and stayed with her. She appreciated this but she always tells me her male friend will take her or she won\u2019t tell me about the actual time or day of the appointment.  She does not accept anything from me or other people, besides her male friend.   Our relationship is this:  I call and she calls and we go out once in a while for lunch, where she refuses to allow me to pay.  Every time I give her something she will return it and not accept it at all.  It\u2019s difficult to be a friend with her since she will be offended if you don\u2019t accept her gifts\u2026really deeply offended.  On the flip side she will not take anything from you at all.  I tried so many times, cookies for holidays, clothes, pay for lunch etc etc.  It\u2019s extremely frustrating.  She will actually save what I give her and return it to me the next time she sees me.  Recently she left me a message saying she had an MRI done and it was scary and something else I couldn\u2019t hear and she ended the call saying congratulations on you new job (I recently got laid off and I\u2019ve been looking for a job and I left her a message saying I found a job).   I honestly didn\u2019t think she was looking for a call back so I took that message as info and moved on.  Four days later I called her back, she didn\u2019t answer and I left a message asking how she is doing and that I miss her and love her and asked if she is out shopping with her male friend.  Cheery message and nothing else.  I didn\u2019t hear back so I called her today and she picked up the phone and literally cussed me out saying I am a bad friend and how I always say I\u2019ll be there for her but when she called to tell me about her mri I waited 4 days to call her and that her male friend agrees that I did a bad thing and she shouldn\u2019t be expecting anything from me since I don\u2019t care.  She also threw in that she does so much for me and this is how I behave.  I am in shock right now.  She has a lot of health issues and goes to the hospital for numerous procedures.  I know she wouldn\u2019t want me to take her or do anything but am I a bad friend for this incident.  I am feeling extremely sad and shocked and the fact that her male friend is agreeing with her is making me feel like a big AH. Am I?",

What was fun was that it's no receipts and cash only jobs so it's under the table and no taxes on that money!  Now she's got like 6 or 7 gigs and the objective of 400$/week is accomplished and I'm proud of her! She's legit her own boss!!! That's awesome!!  Buuut.. she got a little greedy.. she just accepted a gig that alone will bring in 350/week witch almost doubles my objective that I gave her.. except now she needs help getting around.. she doesn't have a license and needs my help to get to her gigs, witch makes sense and I don't mind, except I also work a 9 to 5 and when I Finnish work I gotta go pick up the kids at daycare, make dinner and keep them occupied. I don't have time to be a taxi!! Plus this job she accepted is asking for receipts... now she's gonna need to apply for a buissness license and might need a few weeks to get things legal She's now asking me if she would accept more gigs if I would quit my job to help her out.. honestly.. I like my job.. I do want to support her but.. I made a choice last year to pursue a new career path and things have been going well.. it feels selfish to say no.. but at the same time it feels like giving up on a dream..  Am I the asshole for saying: no I wouldn't quit my job to help her pursue her buissness..? ",

        "selftext": "My roommate (24f) and I (24m) have been living together for about 3 years. We dated for about a year and a half before we mutually broke up. We continued to live together and then moved to a new city to experience life in our careers together.  Some background: my roommate had a traumatic childhood where she was constantly belittled and treated poorly by everyone in her family. I, on the other hand, had a polar opposite childhood where I grew up in a very loving family. So because of this, my roommate and I view all aspects of life completely different. Our schedules are: she works a normal 8am-5pm and I work 6am-3pm but I have to work a lot of OT since I don't get paid as much as she does which causes me to have very little time to do chores.   My roommate and I have always had problems keeping our place clean but when we moved to the new city we made an agreement to not let the apartment get dirty. But we did not hold each other to that and our apartment got dirty again. So about 2 months ago, I had a conversation with her about the cleanliness of the apartment. We decided that she would cook and I would clean dishes. A month goes by and I have tried my best to keep up with the cleaning in the kitchen but wasn't able to keep up with the influx of dishes from cooking/baking.  But I haven't really seen my roommate cleaning in the other areas of the apartment so I decided to have another conversation with her.  I mentioned the cleanliness of the apartment again and requested that we uphold to our original agreement and she agreed. We made a plan where we would clean a different room each weekend. So life went on and again we did not hold ourselves to that agreement. She began to have some mental health problems which I was in total support of and tried to be there for her as best I can like I always have. I can't speak on if this is the reason why the agreements kept falling through. I've had some mental health problems as well because my mom passed 2 years ago but I've tried to not let it effect the people around me.  Now I'm a fairly observant person, so I, majority of the time, notice whether things have been moved/cleaned. Based off my observations, I've not seen evidence of her cleaning in the apartment. So this brings us to a few days ago, where she noticed I was upset about something. I expressed to her my frustrations regarding her effort into the cleanliness of the apartment. I mentioned that I'm putting a lot of effort and don't see much from her. She claims she been cleaning it's just I'm not seeing it. She likes to clean when I'm not around and refuses to clean while I am around the apartment.  So based off of that, I'm just not seeing the evidence of her cleaning. So I asked her to tell me what she has cleaned recently so I can figure out what I'm not seeing. She instantly got defensive and said I have no right to ask her for proof.   So AITA for asking my roommate for proof of her cleaning our apartment?",

        "selftext": "I have this friend I met in college, let\u2019s call him Jay. We\u2019ve known each other for about 3 years now, and have since graduated. Our friendship wasn\u2019t perfect by any means, and we\u2019ve had our ups and downs just like all friendships. Recently, I decided to text him to let him know how much I appreciated him. I texted him \u201cHey, sometimes you really piss me off, but I\u2019m definitely better for meeting you. Can\u2019t wait to see you again\u201d. I realized how bad that sounds out loud so I then text him \u201cIgnore that last text\u201d. Really, I was just referring to small, mildly annoying things he occasionally does. But he asked what I meant by that text. **SOME CONTEXT:**\u00a0 My friends back home and I have this tradition that every last week of August we all take a 5 day vacation in PTown, and I was so excited because I decided to invite Jay this time around. The day before we left for PTown, we took some mushroom gummies in the morning, and decided to take some THC gummies in the evening. I end up getting mildly stoned, but Jay\u2019s reaction was nothing like I had ever seen. He starts screaming and crawling all over the ground and knocking over all the furniture in my room. I tried to calm him down, but I had to have him admitted to the hospital. He might have overdosed, despite only taking 2 gummies.\u00a0 My friends from back home are still expecting me in PTown, so I end up taking the ferry. I text Jay that I\u2019ll pay for his ferry too when he gets released. 3 days later I finally hear from him, he gets his ferry ticket and meets me in PTown with the rest of my friends. He\u2019s pretty banged up and his body is pretty sore, but he\u2019s happy to be in PTown with me. Our last 2 days, we do things that are low energy since he just got released, but there\u2019s still something off about him. Every time one of my other friends said something, Jay would yawn or sigh, like he was bored. I get that he was tired, but my friends (who I told about the whole incident btw) seemed to take it personally.\u00a0 **END CONTEXT.**\u00a0 In my next text to Jay I tell him about the time he was yawning and sighing in front of my friends, and he flips out on me. He responds like \u201cDUDE I WAS FATIGUED FROM BEING IN THE FUKCING HOSPITAL FOR THREE FUCKING DAYS\u201d. And I\u2019m like \u201cyeah, I know. I was just trying to tell you that you do these quirky little things, but they\u2019re not a big deal at all\u201d. That doesn\u2019t work, because in his next text he tells me that his yawning wasn\u2019t \u201cquirky\u201d, like I said and that I was \u201cmaking this whole terrible thing about myself and how I felt\u201d. I obviously didn\u2019t mean to do that, but that\u2019s how he took it, and I tried explaining that. So I ended up deciding to give him some space, but it\u2019s been\u00a0 5 or so months and he still hasn\u2019t texted me back, even after I tried reaching out to him again.\u00a0 AITA. I feel like I might not have worded myself the best in our text conversation, but I also feel like he way overreacted to an easy misunderstanding.  ",

        "selftext": "I\u2019ve had a best friend since childhood. We share many hobbies and generally get along with a \u201cyou do you, I do me\u201d attitude. We\u2019ve had great times over the years, but at least once a year, there\u2019s a situation where he gets triggered, leading to a one-sided \u201cfight.\u201d My wife always reassures me, saying, \u201cHe is so silly, don\u2019t worry, he will come back as he always does.\u201d But I wonder if I\u2019m missing something. These situations usually begin with him venting about something stressful or self-destructive in his life. For instance, he often complains about his career and how it\u2019s ruining his mental health. I once suggested he explore other options, which triggered him. He\u2019s a \u201cgrind to get ahead\u201d kind of guy, but I value my peace, so we often clash on perspectives. The latest issue revolves around his addiction to a video game. We used to play it together when we were younger, but I quit because I didn\u2019t enjoy the anger it caused. He\u2019s recently returned to the game and keeps sending me memes and videos about it, despite knowing I haven\u2019t touched it in 8\u20139 years. He constantly complains about the game, yet tries to rationalize it as a \u201chobby\u201d he enjoys. This pattern of seeking validation is familiar. He always wants me to say, \u201cI\u2019m happy for you, bro,\u201d but it never ends there. When he bought a house, I congratulated him, but he wouldn\u2019t stop talking about how expensive it is and how he\u2019s grinding to pay it off. I once asked, \u201cIs it all worth it?\u201d and that triggered him too. Our conversations follow a predictable cycle: 1. He complains (\u201cWoe me and my hard life,\u201d either directly or via memes).2. I respond with sarcasm, suggesting he reanalyze the value of his choices.3. He deflects, saying things like, \u201cI\u2019m not like other people\u201d or \u201cIt isn\u2019t affecting me.\u201d4. I double down, voicing concern more directly, using analogies like, \u201cJust because an alcoholic has gone to therapy doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t still crave alcohol.\u201d5. He gaslights me, saying, \u201cChill out,\u201d or calling me \u201cdoom and gloom.\u201d6. When I point out his deflection and gaslighting, he blows up, accusing me of thinking I\u2019m \u201cbetter than everyone\u201d or knowing \u201ceverything.\u201d In the latest blow-up, he went further, calling me \u201ctoxic\u201d and saying things like, \u201cYou\u2019re the reason you have no friends,\u201d \u201cYou have a stick up your ass,\u201d and \u201cYou\u2019re mentally fucked up, not even autistic or have an excuse, just mentally sick and fucked up.\u201d I told him, \u201cI\u2019m going to let you get this out of your system,\u201d and walked away. My wife, who has witnessed similar situations before, was supportive and said, \u201cWTF.\u201d Now, I feel apathetic and plan to set boundaries: \u201cEither you get therapy, write me a plan for how you\u2019ll change your attitude, or please don\u2019t talk to me again.\u201d I wonder, though\u2014am I the problem? Have I been the A-hole my whole life and just never noticed? Am I losing my mind, or is this just a toxic dynamic I\u2019ve been stuck in?",

I\u2019m not just going to throw the games out or donate them I play video games to and I know some of these are still pretty valuable for collectors. (The console for the games are here too btw) So WIBTA? Also since so many keep asking, It\u2019s my house I own it. I\u2019m 33F and sibling is 37NB  Also in our state anything left past 30 days can be considered abandoned. Edit for some Q and A:  Time frame: last time I asked was in September and specifically asked them to take them when they came down for Christmas because I would need the space after.Sibling was down for 3 days for Christmas and didn\u2019t box them up and take them Why haven\u2019t I boxed them up?: at the time they weren\u2019t in the way plus it\u2019s a shelf with a glass door and keeps them all safe. Some of my stuff is in there too Why I won\u2019t box them up and send/take them: I\u2019m not our mother nor am I paying for shipping and I know sibling won\u2019t.And I should not have to clean up after an adult for nothing. For context I\u2019m 33F sibling is 37NB. Distance/Visits: Sibling lives only like 40 minutes to hour away (depends on traffic/weather) and we usually see each other twice a month possibly more and we flip on who goes to who\u2019s house Why I need the space: I got a new bigger T.V and I needed a new entertainment center for it, old one was big with lots of storage space for games/blu-rays the new one only has about 1/3 the storage of the first",

While most of the times he is receptive to hearing out why what he says is problematic, he also sometimes \u201cchooses\u201d not to be as sensitive or open-minded, and gets angry at me for telling him that what he\u2019s saying is coming off wrong.  I understand that it\u2019s also exhausting to be wrong about things all the time and I hate correcting him too. I just do it so he doesn\u2019t say the same thing in public.

We both have had many discussions on how we will never blame anyone for their thoughts on something, and as long as they are willing to be open to another pov, they\u2019re not \u201cwrong.\u201d This is because it\u2019s extremely common in our country to have crazy opinions straight out of school because of the family backgrounds of people strongly influence the way they think. Anyway getting to yesterday, he said that people who don\u2019t understand our field of work are not classy, and to that I responded that it\u2019s classist to look down on people for not understanding something just because you do.  He got really mad at me for calling him classist, and I told him multiple times that I didn\u2019t call him classist, I called his choice of words and sentence classist.  It (in my opinion) got heated up for no reason when he could have just been like \u201coh didn\u2019t see it like that oops.\u201d At some point he finally apologized and then he called me a \u201cbitch\u201d for making him feel bad??? and compared me to someone that I really don\u2019t like.  I told him that\u2019s not ok and then the argument got even more heated and finally I told him I\u2019m not going to take his shit anymore and finally he said  \u201cI\u2019m sorry for being transparent with you. I\u2019m not going to talk to you for a few days. I\u2019m sorry for calling you hateful things, I need to change my personality, I\u2019m going to change, so that no one gets hurt anymore\u201d I tried to stay as calm as I could during the entire argument and I really do understand why he\u2019s upset. But I have no idea if I should stop or not. He has told me multiple times that I make him a better person so.  AITA?  EDIT: I would like to clarify a few things that are being debated in the comments. His problematic statements are NOT normal in our field of work, but ARE normal by common people in the place that we live. Some examplea of things he's said are trans women are a problem because they're just men who want to win the olympics in the women's category and Women do have equality they just want more thats why they keep saying they dont",

        "selftext": "Recently I had baked a cake for my father since his birthday came up and I intended it to share it between him and me. recently I got mad at my brother's for something they did so I really didnt want to give them any cake. I came home to see that a lot more of the cake had been eaten; So I asked my dad about it and he said he shared it with my brothers. I got irritated that he did that (also I told my brothers if they ate it they owe me money. I am broke highschool student) so I went to my brother's room and ask them for money and they said denied responsibility for eating and said that it was okay because my Dad gave it to them. I got angry at him because I told him that I didn't want them to have any of it, he said he wanted to repair the relationship between me and my brother by sharing something that I made. I don't think that it's his business to do that. He didn't seem to understand so I kind of told him off about the cake and how it hurt my feelings he still did not care. He felt like it was something useless to even talk about. Am I the ass hole for telling him off about the cake I made. Also for reference every single time I get mad or tell him off he just says I'm sorry that YOU got offended and never owns up to his action. Edit: this was not on his birthday it was 3 days after. Mom forgot to bake a cake because she has been busy with extended family passing. I also told me dad before I even baked the cake that they can't have it. Yes I wanted it to be a moment between me and my father. And no It wasn't a petty reason why I am not letting my brothers have it.",

        "selftext": "For background, I (16m) am on the autism spectrum and have another related mental illness that causes me to very obviously mirror other peoples traits, movements, catchphrases, etc. I've been working on it in therapy, but it's still an ongoing issue and I'm not making super obvious progress. The process has been slow and I've only gotten a bit better about being independent in my personality.   Today at lunch I was sitting with my normal group of friends (Victoria, Mark, Aisley, and Nicole) and everything seemed pretty normal? We interacted fine and had good conversations. The only notable thing is that I repeated what a lot of them said in silly voices (when we were joking around) and copied this movement that Mark does a lot. He does this thing where he leans forward and wiggles his fingers in peoples faces muttering Do as I say! Do as I say! He's done this for years and I've picked it up since we've known each other. I did it to Victoria and everyone went really quiet. I assumed the joke fell flat and so I just went back to eating. The rest of lunch was normal enough and I didn't think twice about it. We walked to our next classes together and kept messing around in the halls. After that class finished and I was walking to the last class of the day, some girl I didn't know walked up to me and called me a leech and an asshole for making everyone at the table so uncomfortable when I did that movement at lunch. I sat there and just blinked at her, which I assume she took as rude because she stormed off.    When I got home I got my phone (I left it in my room) and checked it. Turns out I had a bunch of messages from Nicole that she wanted to warn me that I might get kicked out of the table. Apparently this is an ongoing issue and they haven't liked me for a while. I asked Mark about it but I think he blocked me? When I asked Victoria about it she said that it was because I kept copying them and it was weird to be around me. I tried to explain that I didn't really mean to creep them out, but that I was sorry and would try to be better. She didn't want to hear it and I guess I'm just... kicked out now? I just want to know if I'm actually an asshole or if I'm valid in feeling a bit upset about all of this. So, AITA for stealing my friends' personalities? ",

I think he\u2019s taking it personal especially since i\u2019m the youngest of like seven other kids but I genuinely don\u2019t mean harm when it takes me a bit to respond so it bugs me when he sees it that way it also bugs me with his replies like just say a heart back or something no need to make me feel guilty for having a life. I live with my mother full time so I asked her for her opinion and she was obviously on his side so i\u2019m probably definitely overreacting but I still want to see others opinions and before people tell me its not hard to occasionally check your messages I know I just am so terrible at getting back to people or I see his messages at 3AM and forget to reply in the morning I think its also hard because every time I take to long to respond he gets all weird and it upsets me, anyways please tell me, AITA?

        "selftext": "We got married in September. She moved in with my at a guesthouse I own 40km south of the city she works in. After a week she moved back to her apartment with her brother because of the compute. They had a roommate that's lease ended on 1 Jan and I moved in with her. Her brother and her own the apartment, but since his company said he has to be back at the office one week a month, he has been traveling from his home city to stay in the apartment.  It's a two bed one bath. The first weeks weeks we were together was great. First time we have gotten to live together just us as a married couple. Then her brother came over. He's a decent guy and I like him. He's also an actuary and doing fine.  He and my wife (brother and sister) are best friends. They have an incredible relationship. Two nights ago in bed she told me he will be staying two weeks a month till August when he saves up enough to buy another place. I told her that we (34M, 32F) have not gotten any time to be married couple and she wants  a baby so when the baby comes (hopefully later this year) we will have never had any time to just be us as a couple, develop that relationship.  First thing the next morning she told him and he wanted to move out. She was depressed the whole day. That night I sat us all down at the dinner table and said we need to talk to each other. I explained myself again that we never got time to be a couple and he agreed. I invited him to stay as long as he wanted. My wife was happy and he said he would rather move to his own place and grow to our full couple potential everyone agreed. The next night my wife and I were at the mall shopping for a potato ricer so I could make us all gnocchi. When he called and we had to rush him to the hospital because, well no one told me why. When we got back to the appartment to fetch him he has a runny nose but they decided he could drive his own car and she would go with him. I stayed as I has a late night work commitment (IT deployment) They went, the doctor put him on a drip and they came back with some over the counter flu meds. That was yesterday. Today I joked that he could rent a place that my wife and I are looking to buy as a investment property. It's a joke because none of us can afford to live there if it wasn't paying for itself as an investment.  The both took that extremely seriously and my wife said that I made him feel unwelcome in the apartment. Am I the asshole?  Edit: my wife and I rent the apartment from her and her brother at full market value.  He moved in because his work from home policy changed. When I agreed to move here and away from my place outside the city, it was just my wife and I renting the apartment. So that she and he would not have to go through the trouble of finding a tenant to take over.",

He made a card with the information on it. I\u2019m not sure when I saw it. He had been unreliable in the past. I wrote said gift card number down to verify the amount was correct.  Jump to last feb. I found the handwritten numbers and thought they were a gift card of mine since it was just jumbled into my stack of cards. My dad has been to this place many times since the gift was given. I never asked if he used it. I put it in, it worked! And, it was a lot! I used some of the funds to help my friend at the same time. I honestly didn\u2019t remember his card existed in that moment. I enjoyed what was purchased and kept living.  My dad went to use the gift card this year. \u201cArchived/unaccepted\u201d My brother does the due diligence and finds it\u2019s been used and the dates correlated with my activity.  He confronts me and says I am a thief and evil. I tell both of them I am sorry, I definitely used it, I didn\u2019t realize it at the time and I would pay my dad back immediately, dad says not now. This isn\u2019t good enough for my brother. He won\u2019t speak to me and had a full blown meltdown (manic depressive).  So, aita? My dad agreed to let me buy him another one or simply go with him next time he wants to make a purchase there but my brother won\u2019t accept that deal. He finally texted me today saying he has nothing to say to me until I admit guilt (I admitted I did it, just not maliciously) and that he won\u2019t talk until the card is replaced (dad said absolutely not and it\u2019s his card and he will let me know when he wants it replaced\u2026 idk why but after the last text I told him if it helps my relationship with my brother I am happy to go ahead and get the purchase taken care of).  I don\u2019t understand, my dad and I have the discrepancy and came to agreeable terms for repayment. ",

I was assigned a computer with administrator privileges, so I can monitor the other computers in the lab. One day, I noticed that my classmate was playing a game on their computer. Since we\u2019re not supposed to be doing that, I decided to check on it using my admin privileges to confirm if they were actually playing a game or if I was just imagining it. When I checked, I saw that they were indeed playing a game, so I decided to mess with their computer to let them know they were breaking the rule. I didn\u2019t delete anything or do anything too extreme, but I did interfere with their work. Afterward, my classmate reacted to what I did, but they didn\u2019t say anything specific. They didn\u2019t seem upset or anything, so I figured it wasn\u2019t a big deal. I thought maybe they were just brushing it off. Later, I told the teacher that my classmate was playing a game on their computer. The teacher responded by saying that they were actually looking at their presentation. That\u2019s when I realized that what I thought was a game was actually part of their presentation. At that point, I felt really guilty because I had messed with something that was important to them, and I didn\u2019t even realize it at the time. I know I was trying to follow the class rules, but I feel like I might have overstepped. I didn\u2019t mean to mess up their presentation, but I still feel bad about it.

My sister lives at the corner of her neighborhood and these two black trucks always accelerate around the corner. She has two young kids that are just now learning how to bike and it\u2019s been bothering her for some time. We pulled into the driveway around 11pm at night when all the sudden one of the black trucks speeds by us. My sister is insisting that we go and confront him. So I drive us over there. She introduces herself as his neighbor and says that his truck and another truck always speed around the corner and that she has 2 young kids. He says the other truck is his son\u2019s.  She politely asked him if they could slow down. His reply was \u201cdo you have radar lasers in your eyes\u201d? She said excuse me and repeats himself. At that point I got annoyed and said let\u2019s go, this guy is a dickhead. He raised his voice and called her a degenerate mother because while her kids are riding bikes she\u2019s sitting in the road near the corner\u2026 but she\u2019s only there in case one of those trucks speeds around the corner.  At that point I repeated myself much louder this time to make sure they both heard me. She starts walking back and he says step on my property to me. I tell him I\u2019m not stepping on your property and we start hurling insults at each other. We drive off still hurling insults at each other. I later found out this guy has a reputation for being a dick. They live four houses down from each other and I\u2019d hate for him to speed by out of spite and something bad happen. I told my sister (since she lives there) to go by and reintroduce herself and apologize. To basically say \u201c11pm was not the time for that and my brother was way out of line.

        "selftext": "I (24m) have a selfish and narcissistic sister, 'Sarah' (18f). I have written a post about her a few months ago, and explained why she's selfish and narcissistic . So, I don't think I need to expand on that anymore. But here's the story; Last Sunday, I cleaned the entire house, all by myself, around 1am because it's easier to do when everyone else is asleep. I cleaned the ceiling fan in the living room, dusted the shelves and frames, swept the floor, vacuumed the floor, and mopped the floor. I have no trouble doing these because I'm always home since I'm still studying, and my elder sister is working. So, it's fair for me to do the chores, although my elder sister helps out as well with the laundry and folding the clothes (I fold my own clothes).  Why don't our younger sister help out? Like I've said, I've made a post about it, and it's a pretty long story. To cut it short, she's simply just lazy, selfish, and narcissistic. Today, Sarah saw a bug or whatever and used a lizard spray to kill it. Lizard spray is more dense and oily compared to a mosquito spray. Why did she use a lizard spray when we have a mosquito spray? I honestly have no clue. So, I told her to mop the floor since the floor is oily and I just cleaned the house a few days ago. To me it's fair since she was the one who caused the mess and I was the one who cleaned the house. But she got defensive, saying Why me? Why do I have to mop the floor? (goes to show how narcissistic she is). I kept quiet and just gave her a look. She then got a wet tissue and wiped the floor, instead of mopping it (goes to show how lazy she is). Not only that, but she didn't even wipe it properly because the floor was still oily and the stain got worse because she used a wet tissue that is soapy (goes to show how selfish she is). She then went to her room without a word. In the end, I had to mop the floor again because she made it worse. I didn't call her out because it's just useless when dealing with someone selfish like that. It's like talking to a wall. If I had call her out, all she will do is get mad, play victim, and start a fight with me, which I'm not interested in because it was 10pm and also an unnecessary argument since I know I'm not in the wrong. To be honest, I'm writing this just to vent out. But what do you guys think? Am I the asshole in this situation? Edit: If you think I just hate my sister and I'm being too harsh on her. Keep in mind, the stain on the floor was literally next to the corner of our dining table, which is dangerous because anyone could've slipped and hit their head on the sharp edge of the table. Imagine losing an eye because of it. The fact that she didn't clean up the floor immediately until I told her to, goes to show how selfish she is. She literally just sat there, on her phone, while the floor was hazardous. So yeah, she really is selfish. Edit 2: The point of this post is not about her not listening to me or that she used wet tissues instead of the mop like I told her to. The point here is that she doesn't take responsibility for her own actions. If you made a mess, would you leave it or would you clean it up? Exactly. She didn't clean it up until I told her to. On top of that, she didn't even clean the floor properly, spreading the oil even more. Not only that, but she also just immediately went to her room, leaving the floor that she half-heartedly cleaned. Also, like in the first edit, it is dangerous because the floor is slippery. What if one of us slipped and hit the corner of the table? The whole point is about her taking responsibility, not about this mop vs tissue that so many are bringing up. Edit 3: Some of you are calling me the asshole. Okay, try putting yourself in my shoes. What would you do if you had just cleaned your house, and then someone, either your family or friends, just made a mess. Would you just let it go or would you tell them to take responsibility. Majority of you would go for the latter, right? Okay. Now, how would you feel after telling them to clean up their mess, only for them to play victim and clean it up half-heartedly, causing you to clean it yourself in the end? Would you be delighted or would you be somewhat mad or disappointed? Ask yourself that question and see whether you will behave differently or the same as me. Keep in mind, deep inside I was mad, but I didn't say anything. Just as written in the post, I didn't call her out or anything. I just cleaned it up myself, made this post to vent out, and moved on. Edit 4: Sure, maybe I'm the asshole for the way I'm writing this. But that's not the point. The point is about her not taking responsibilities. So please. make judgement based on the content of the story itself, not exterior stuff like the way I'm writing, me being emotional, the post is too long, etc. Final edit (hopefully): If you are wondering why a bunch of adults are living under one roof, I am Asian, and we live in Asia. It is normal for Asians to still live with their parents, unless they get married and have their own family. For single people, most of us live with our parents, even if we're 30 years old. At the end of the day, there's nothing wrong with it because it's just the culture in most Asian families, same as how it is common for Americans to live on their own once they start college. It might sound weird to you, but it's our culture, so please don't be rude about it. Besides, us adults living under one roof is not even the point of this post. I don't get why some are bringing it up when it's not even the main issue.",

Recently I (F19) noticed that she had left some dishes near the sink and it was inconvenient as when I wash my dishes, I can\u2019t dry them anywhere. Her dishes didn\u2019t have food on them but they still weren\u2019t washed. It had been nearly 4 days when I felt enough was enough and I called her to clean her things (I didn\u2019t see her in the flat during this period). She gave some excuse that she was caught up in something urgent, I was getting really annoyed and told her that I didn\u2019t care and she should just come back to get her dishes done cuz none of us are able to use that sink (there\u2019s 6 people in total in this flat). She paused, apologised and went \u201cwell if you really need the complete space, can you help me wash the dishes? It should be relatively clean too\u201d. This made me furious as why should I wash another person\u2019s dishes? I\u2019m not the cleanest, it took me some time myself to learn to clean after myself, so why am I expected here to clean someone else\u2019s mess? I told her how I\u2019ll give her until the next 3 days to clear up her mess. Some flatmates don\u2019t wanna share their opinion cuz they owe her a favor, but 2 other flatmates told me how my attitude was unnecessary. I don\u2019t think I said anything wrong. AITA?",

        "selftext": "Ok folks I'll be honest, this is incredibly low stakes and more to prove a point than anything else. The long and short of it is my husband asked me to turn off the lights after I laid down. We're on vacation, it's currently about 09:00 in the morning, and I'd turned the light on to read something on the computer as I don't like using my laptop in the dark.  After I sat back down on the couch next to him, he suggested I get some more sleep as I hadn't slept well. I agreed, laid down, and that's when he asked me to get the light. He couldn't because our infant daughter fell asleep on him, and we know if we move her within 30 minutes of falling asleep she'll wake up and be super crabby. As I was getting the light, I lightly accused him of AH behavior. My reasoning? He didn't say anything while I was sitting up, or even by my computer. He argues that because I left the light on, I'm the AH for wasting electricity. I then told him if it went up here, he'd be labelled the bigger AH and he said prove it. So here I am.  AITA for leaving a light on? Quick ETA: ok y'all, I hear you. I definitely came here full of bluster. I acknowledge calling him names was petty and childish, it's just how we've always played. Regardless, I should've just gotten the light after I was done and I've already promised him apology nachos. I made sure to send the link to my husband, and he and I have taken turns reading the answers. Respectful/neutral ones we just nod and agree with, more biting ones make us laugh. He says thanks for sticking up for dads!",

Me and my fiance have chosen the bridesmaid and bestman and the problem is\u2026 I\u2019ve lost the connection with my best man.  Let\u2019s call him Connor, has tough time rn in his life, I assume he might be depressed and the last time we talked was couple months ago. He was my close friend for many years and when i asked him to be the best man we were really close.  Now he became my secondary friend and we don\u2019t talk. He also moved to another city that\u2019s really really far. I would like to change my best man to another friend that I\u2019m really close rn. We have better relation, we TALK and we\u2019re seeing each other at least once in a month. She\u2019s very helpful with the wedding stuff and she\u2019s helping me choose the dress.  I know she\u2019s a she, so we will have two bridesmaids, but it\u2019s lesbian wedding so it doesn\u2019t have to be traditional.  Should I do it? How can I tell him that without ruining our relationship? Please help \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc EDIT:  didn\u2019t write it, but I tried to reach out and we\u2019ve seen this couple months ago because of my idea. I understand that he\u2019s depressed and even tried to talk with him about it, but since the meeting he\u2019s been invited to couple meetings and didn\u2019t attend nor give the info. EDIT2: Where have I said that I\u2019m dropping him? He\u2019s my friend, if he needs some time to get better - okay, if it\u2019s too much for him rn - okay, I\u2019ll still be there for him, but he just won\u2019t be the bestman.",

        "selftext": "I (22f) have an older brother (John-32m) who has been with his fianc\u00e9 (Jane-30f) for 4 years. They have a 4 month old. Jane found out she was pregnant at 5 and a half weeks and immediately called my mum to tell her. Mum was confused, but still very excited. Jane said she was going to tell John when he got back from his work trip. A few hours later, she called again, sobbing, saying she has \u2018insatiable cravings\u2019. Mum made a joke like \u2018isn\u2019t it a bit early for cravings?\u2019 and Jane went OFF on her. She started yelling about how this was \u2018her pregnancy\u2019 and no one else\u2019s. It was an odd reaction. she also apologised for her outburst by blaming it on hormones. When my brother returned from his trip, him and Jane left to stay at her mother\u2019s and we didn\u2019t see her until after the baby was born. John said this was because Jane was afraid of losing the pregnancy and wanted to be with her mum and we needed to respect boundaries. Whenever someone would ask about Jane or the baby, they would shut it down with vague answers like \u2018Every pregnancy is different\u2019 or \u2018She\u2019s carrying small, which isn\u2019t unusual\u2019. They barely shared anything about the pregnancy. No ultrasound pictures, no baby shower, and Jane didn\u2019t want anyone around during the delivery. I also discovered that every craving she listed, came from one article about pregnancy cravings (she even listed multiple items in the same order as the article). When the baby was born, we were finally allowed to see Jane and John (and baby of course). It was very bittersweet as we all wished we could have been there for Jane to help out, but Jane and John both reassured us that we did help out by staying away during the pregnancy. The weirdest part though, is how Jane describes the birth. She claims she had an epidural via IV drip into her HAND (edited bc I didn't elaborate--)\u2026 which is NOT how those are administered. When I asked clarifying questions (thinking she had gotten confused, which is understandable) she shut down and refused to answer, like how she would during the pregnancy. She said the baby had 'latching issues' because he was born with no umbilical cord stump. This can technically happen, but it\u2019s a rare and fatal medical condition that their baby does not have. The final straw was when she told us that the baby \u2018basically fell out of her\u2019 within an hour of being in labour, despite my brother telling us how hard the birth was (and even stating that was why they weren\u2019t going to try for any more kids). Mum is on the same side as me, and has been noting this inconsistencies and inaccuracies but doesn\u2019t know how to bring it up. And their reactions don\u2019t help. A few days ago, my brother text mum saying her doubt of Jane is disrespectful and they both want full apologies from the both of us for 'bullying' Jane about her pregnancy/labour. I haven't made any outright accusations about it, nor have I said any of this to Jane. I've only asked questions when she brings the birth/pregnancy up. AITA for having doubts?",

        "selftext": "We have a lot of kids age 14 down to age 2 with another baby on the way. Everyone age 4 and up has assigned chores throughout the day but the biggest portion of them happen after school from 4-5pm but it takes a ton of effort to keep them on task. Example of the expectations is for the 14 year old: pick up dog poop in the backyard, fold & put away his laundry, clean his room (that it shared with 2 younger brothers & they all need to help), brush his dog, and collect trash from the main level once a week. I ask each kid to pitch in on what they can handle for their age & then try to hold them accountable for what their assignments are.  It is not as stressful on nights when we don\u2019t have to rush older kids to get changed into uniforms & out the door by 5:15 to have my husband take them to activities because then it\u2019s just eating into their free time if it\u2019s not done yet. I feel stressed by being left with all the little kids in a chaotic environment which means I have to watch them closer if it\u2019s not tidy and toddler safe and have to get dinner on the table plus grade my 8th & 7th graders homeschool assignments while my husband and the helpful kids are out of the house.  So I asked my husband who teleworks to come out of his office when he\u2019s done with work (sometime between 4:30 and 5) to help manage kids so I\u2019m not doing it alone with so many moving parts. He agreed to help more but he doesn\u2019t care if kids are actually done or not and still takes off for activities. I don\u2019t want them to go if they aren\u2019t completely done with their chores. My husband thinks I have too high of expectations and shouldn\u2019t care if for example a kid says they are done but didn\u2019t pick up dog poop. I think this teaches them to not be responsible and also has future consequences that directly impact me like when kids are playing in the backyard and come running in with dog poop stuck in their shoes that I now have to clean.  This is a reoccurring conflict in our marriage that I want the house to get straightened up at certain points throughout the day because it makes my job as a homeschooling stay at home mom easier to monitor for safety if things don\u2019t spiral out of control. AITA for trying to hold kids accountable or for even trying to keep the house picked up? ",

In the first few weeks, things were fine, but over time, we became distant and passive-aggressive about our shared space. I have acute migraines and need the room pitch black to sleep, as any light triggers migraines. I\u2019ve talked to my roommate multiple times about this, and while she seemed to understand, lights continued to be left on, including her extremely bright alarm clock. I tried to handle it and sleep with some lights on, but she then brought in a new light that illuminated the whole room in purple, adding to the already bright alarm clock. One night, I tried to wake her up to talk about it, but she was asleep, and I couldn\u2019t turn the light off. After waiting a couple of hours for it to turn off on its own (it didn\u2019t), I unplugged it. I planned to talk to her about it in the morning, but when I woke up, she had left for class and left a note saying I needed to stop touching her stuff, and that the light would have turned off on its own. I didn\u2019t think much of it and decided to discuss it with her later. When she came back, she immediately started complaining about me touching her things, saying she likes having a light in the room, and that she\u2019s had to compromise on everything. She mentioned how she likes keeping the window open at night, and I always close it because I\u2019m afraid of break-ins. She also mentioned hating my curtain that blocks sunlight (the one she said I could have), and how I turn off her fairy lights at night, which I did to reduce light when she was asleep. She argued that the new light wasn\u2019t facing me, so it shouldn\u2019t be an issue, but it was still bright enough to illuminate the whole room. I tried to explain that this wasn\u2019t just about comfort\u2014it\u2019s a medical issue for me, and the lack of sleep is affecting my migraines and school performance. She didn\u2019t seem to understand and kept insisting that I need to compromise now. I understand she feels like I\u2019m not letting her use her lights, but my sleep is being severely impacted, and I\u2019m struggling with migraines and poor mental health because of it.

        "selftext": "I (F16) absolutely used to Adore my English teacher (F49) until recently. So in December of 2024 i turned 16 and i was so so so excited for my birthday and i had been talking for weeks about it to my favorite teacher (English teacher). She seemed kind of careless about it but i didn't think anything about it. Worth to note, i have extremely strong emotions. So i was super excited about my birthday, smiling and giggling all morning. During English class (first period) me and my best friend sat outside and talked about our grades with the teacher. My bestie asks if the teacher has forgotten something. It takes a while before says asks if it was my birthday and i joyfully said yes. For the record in my country every single day of the year have 1-2 names like tied to it so if it's your name or middle name it's your names birthday. My English teachers middle name happened to have a name birthday the same day as my normal birthday. I asked her jokingly where my happy birthday was. And she replied with well where is my cake? it honestly pisses me off a bit. I know it doesn't have anything with religious reasons either as she has said herself that she's an atheist and does in fact celebrate birthdays. Her sassy answer made me kind of upset especially when almost all of my other teachers wished me a happy birthday. The special needs teacher specifically was super joyful towards me. To her i had just briefly said it once and she remembered (my birthday that is) . I give all my love to her for that. It made me feel like why can everyone, even teachers i don't like wish me a happy birthday but not my favorite teacher. I want to include one more thing. She might have actually mocked my attachment issues. I used to struggle with attachment issues (towards teachers) in middle school due to being bullied, having barely any friends and really poor mental health. I have told max 5 people about what i went through. My English teacher was one. She said like okay, see you tomorrow. I asked why she had responded so short and well pretty much unattended to the thing i told her and she simple said well, we don't want you to become attached again now do we. It might not have been a mockery but it really didn't feel positive as it was a fresh wound and at the time i was still struggling with getting unattached to my old teachers. I told her to piss off after that and she didn't seem to happy about it.  So AITA for thinking she is acting well like an A-hole? Edit one : i knew a lot of people would think i'm the A-hole and i understand why but telling me that nobody has to care about me, that's pretty fucking mean. Like i understand that she doesn't owe me anything but that doesn't mean NOBODY has to care about me. I know it was childish of me to be upset but sometimes that's how life works. As people also said i am still a literal child, i am well aware that the behavior won't fly and i am trying to get out of it. Also for the people saying teacher attachment is inappropriate and weird trust me i know, i have apologized to teachers in the past i was attached to since i knew that my behavior was inappropriate. I'm doing my best to get away from that issue but it's hard.",

        "selftext": "I\u2019m a single dad to a 15 year old girl. We live in an area where we get a lot of snow every winter. Around the time she was 11, I taught her how to shovel and usually, we do it together. We have a decent sized driveway and walkway. Sometimes, if it\u2019s too icy, I\u2019ll do the whole thing myself. Over the weekend, we got some unexpected snow while I was at work. I called my daughter and asked that she shovel out a bit of the driveway so I\u2019ll have room to park and get out the next day, as well as shovel the walkway and steps. She said yes. When I came home, the entire driveway was shoveled and the walkway and steps were cleared perfectly. I thanked her and said she did a good job. She then told me that when she went out to shovel, she saw our neighbor (who\u2019s a couple years older than her) was shoveling his walkway. She offered him $40 of her own money to shovel for her and he accepted.  I told her that I had asked her to shovel, not the neighbor and it was something assigned to her. She asked what the big deal was, as it got done. She also pointed out when she has her own house some day, she can easily just pay someone to do it so she doesn\u2019t have to do it. I told her she wasn\u2019t in trouble but next time it snowed, she was helping me shovel and going forward if I asked her to do it, she was expected to do it. She seemed a little disappointed but didn\u2019t argue. I was talking to my mom about the situation and she told me I completely overreacted, and pointed out my daughter has a point. The job got done and it shouldn\u2019t matter how it gets done, as long as it does, and the neighbor kid willingly did it (which I confirmed with him later that he was happy to do it for the extra cash). My mom said I should\u2019ve praised my daughter\u2019s initiative.  So, now I\u2019m left wondering if I was the asshole for lecturing my daughter on this.  Edit: To those asking, she got the money from babysitting. She works for a different neighbor twice a week and is paid $18/hr. We\u2019ve had talks about money constantly over the years, ever since she was old enough to receive birthday and Christmas money and decide how to spend it. She knows the value of the dollar, that once you spend money it\u2019s gone, and to think before you buy. She says to her, this was worth the $40.  And to those asking why it bugged me, I thank you because I wasn\u2019t even sure myself. I think I just want to make sure that she has these skills, but I also understand people\u2019s points that she has the skill and she can now decide to use it if she\u2019s in a situation like this one.  **Update*** I want to thank everyone who talked some sense into me. You all were right, it really doesn\u2019t matter how it gets done. As well as the fact that yes, there are times I contract out work of my own, so it\u2019s unfair to expect otherwise of her. One of my main priorities is that she\u2019s able to do things on her own. I won\u2019t always be around to help and I want her to be independent. But, I realize now, this was her being independent and getting something done, just in a different way. I spoke with her and apologized for lecturing her. I also added I was proud of her for taking initiative and explained why I reacted the way I did. Additionally, I thanked her for getting it done, regardless of how it was. She forgave me and everything is good now. We did have another talk about money but she insists that\u2019s how she wanted to spend it, so I\u2019m going to leave it alone for now. But she says she appreciates me admitting I was wrong. I told her next time, she can either hire the neighbor again or do it herself, I don\u2019t care as long as it\u2019s what they both want.  Some people said I should force her to put more into savings. She already puts a good amount away on her own. I\u2019m going to continue to let her decide what works for her.  Also, to those going to either extreme that either 1) I was wrong for having her shovel because she\u2019s a girl or 2) assuming I\u2019m only making her do chores and expecting her to do them herself because she\u2019s a girl, you\u2019re wrong. I do everything that I ask her to do, and I also occasionally contract out tasks. I don\u2019t care if she does in the future. This was a genuine mistake on my part and not anything malicious where I expect more/less of my daughter because she\u2019s a girl. ",

It didn't offend me at all. I called them fat (okay fatty haha) in a joking way and I was assure that they knew I was joking- and I never meant to ACTUALLY bring them down on purpose.  I was always made fun of for my appearance and my looks and all that shit when I was in elementary up until now. I thought that it was normal to make fun of it. But- I never actually meant it if I did make comments. I would only do it if my friends started making fun of each others appearances.  I found out recently from one of my friends that is apart of this friend group that the girls were upset and uncomfortable by these Jokes. I texted her and told her I understood and i wouldn't make these jokes anymore. So since i was at home at the time, I texted both of the girls I hurt. I apologized to one and they accepted my apology. (Im aware apologies dont fix everything and I still left that person hurt.)  But Then i go and text the second girl I have yet to apologize to and I found out she blocked me weeks ago. Even though I never actually said those fat jokes directly to her, she still blocked me. I feel like a Pos.  Mind you, Im very aware that I tend to not think before I speak a lot of the times and I reassured them to tell me if I say anything that hurts their feelings. But I just found out that they were uncomfortable with letting me know. So that makes me feel like an even bigger pos.  ive apologized, ive done everything I can to assure that ive realized my mistake but I feel like they dont want to be friends with me anymore.  I grew up with barely any friends, always one or two, or none. So losing friends makes me very emotional.  ",

        "selftext": "My (24F) best friend (24F) of seven years ghosted me. She claims I changed, cause I used to pride myself on my independence but now rely on my BF.  We\u2019ve always split the tab via PayPal, but she often forgets to pay me back. Recently at the gym, when I reminded her, she said she was tight on money, so I told her it's ok. But she added: Not that you would relate So naturally, I asked her to elaborate.Now that you've got a sugar daddy, you must have saved a lot of money HUH I reminded her that I\u2019ve only been a full-time student since July, have never dropped out, and care for a chronically ill parent, too. So what if I don't work at the moment? I also pointed out that she works part-time but only spends her money on vacations with her BF. I asked why she couldn\u2019t just be happy for me. I\u2019ve always been there for her through her struggles, including her dropping out of high school and BF problems. I asked her if she's jealous. She\u2019s a shy introvert, while I\u2019m an eccentric extrovert. We both have new relationships. She only told me about her Swiss long-distance boyfriend in December, even though they started dating in August, cause she didn\u2019t wanna jinx it. Explains why she often skipped our gym and dinner dates, as she was often abroad or working retail.  As for me, I\u2019ve been dating my BF since September. We\u2019ve known each other since 2019 through a language app and after months of helping him through paperwork, he got a work visa and moved to Germany. I showed him around and barely two weeks in, he asked me out. I understood her anxiety and stress but she didn't understand my silence on my BF. He\u2019s funny and forthcoming, a bit too clingy but also pretty and protective. I kept the relationship secret because I'm tired of getting lovebombed only for the flirt to turn out abusive & coked up. The way a man treats me is thr biggest social proof to me.  Finally, I broke the news to her, but she was pissed. I shoulda shared sooner, given how TMI and shameless I always am. I said it hurt me, too, so she she apologized, too, for hiding her own relationship and said she's burnt out from retail and her trade/apprenticeship. When she asked how I afford my trips and shopping sprees since I quit my job, I told her my BF paid. She seemed perplexed and mentioned that her BF is rather modern, they go 50/50 but she struggles a lot cause he's an older IT specialist and it takes a toll on her to live up to his living standard. Not to mention the long distance struggle. She visits him since she lives with her mom while he lives alone an has privacy. My BF, on the other hand, fights for the bill, hates my thrifting and feels uncomfortable about visiting me empty handed. He even calls me his little housewife cause I cook for him. I know I could have picked my words better but I'm not a fucking sugar baby, I'm not mooching off of him, considering I treat him like a king when he's at my place. ",

That night, the insulation in my BnB was very bad and it was VERY cold (about 15 Fahrenheit). My mom slept, but I couldn't. I texted my sister and asked if I could sleep on her couch because I was shivering. She was angry I disturbed her during exams and said no. I was angry but didn't go to her house. That next morning, I asked if I could take a shower at hers to warm up because I was still freezing. She refused because she did not want to clean the bathroom after me.

C: There\u2019s something wrong with his carLast time we were driving to the city we had to come backSo I feel bad because I had told him about it. He said yes he would go. Then I told him we\u2019re going to dinner first and he said that\u2019s fine I\u2019ll do my own thing in the meantime, but because his car doesn\u2019t work.L:Or let him drive in later with your car?C:I might just go to the later outing  L:that\u2019s mean You\u2019re canceling on dinner the day before dinner and then we might get penalized bc they reserve seating for 5 and only 4 show upHave him drop u off at our house for dinner and he can drive in later for the outing You\u2019re catering to a man rn, you said you wouldn\u2019t! \ud83d\ude2d\ud83e\udd1a\ud83c\udffcC:I\u2019m not catering that\u2019s just doesn\u2019t feel rightL:The solution is there let him take ur car later thereIs there a bigger reason as to why you\u2019re canceling on dinner ? If it\u2019s money I got you and u can literally take however long you need to pay me back no problem bc I feel like him driving your car there later is a good solutionC:It\u2019s not about the money, but I appreciate you saying that. It\u2019s just the layout of this outing and his car situation L:Of course you\u2019re welcome!  Yeah it is is a weird timeline I understand, but I feel like the best solution is for him to drive in with your car later? Put yourself in S shoes, it would be hurtful. I\u2019m sure your bf would be okay coming in later but at the end of the day it\u2019s your decision C:Yea I know it would be hurtful if i didn\u2019t go that\u2019s why maybe I thought if I can\u2019t make the dinner reservation I\u2019ll just meet them later, but to be mean was not my intentionI\u2019m going to ask him what he wants to do. I think if we drive together we can uber from S place to the restaurant and he can go somewhere to eat aroundL:No not necessarily mean but like just sad bc this has been planned for 2 weeks, he can\u2019t drive later in your car there later? So he\u2019s not waiting too long?C:I told him he can either come with and just hang out alone or come later. I also told him he doesn\u2019t have to goL:He should for sure still come later he\u2019ll have fun, the time we\u2019re having dinner he can drive in, I think he\u2019ll be in traffic while we have dinner End of textsSo this was planned 2 weeks, they knew his car was messed up 3 weeks ago, they had 3 weeks to come up with a solution. What they ended up doing was that C texted S saying that her and her bf would drive in together.This isn\u2019t the first time, I feel like I have to beg her to do the right thingLast time we planned a vacay she refused to fly an airline, and I told her we have to be considerate bc another friend is on a budget and she said oh okay you\u2019re right.

He revealed that Derek\u2019s biological father is not his real dad, and Derek is completely unaware of this. Intrigued, I asked Cody how he had come to know this information. Cody explained that Derek\u2019s mother has been having an ongoing affair with his stepfather, who Derek has never met. Cody disclosed that his mother is fully aware of this situation. The only reason she hasn\u2019t divorced his stepfather is because she is waiting for him to die so that she can inherit his entire estate. To my astonishment, Cody showed me a picture of his stepfather, and to my surprise, Derek bears a striking resemblance to him. Cody made me promise not to reveal this information to Derek, as it would not only devastate Derek\u2019s family but also his parents\u2019. He warned me that breaking up a family would have devastating consequences. It has been approximately eight years since I had this conversation with Cody, and we have not spoken since. However, I maintain a close relationship with Derek. Occasionally, I feel guilty for not telling Derek the truth, but I am reluctant to take responsibility for potentially causing irreparable harm to a family- especially since his mom passed a few weeks ago.

        "selftext": "This is kind of a weird situation, but I (50f) live in a condo & share a 4 car driveway with my condo neighbors. It\u2019s a tandem space, on a busy city street with bike lanes, and they have two cars and we have none. For the past few months one of their cars has been parked unmoved in their spot closest to the street, so the other driver drives his car into and out of their other space using our side of the driveway. This shouldn\u2019t be so annoying, but when they moved in they used our driveway whenever they wanted, like if they had workmen or guests, etc, so I would get mad at them and tell them to stop doing that in email and in person. They also mentioned to the condo association that they wanted to remove the condo trash cans that were technically in their space, and put them into our finished back yard so they could expand their parking space so three cars would fit. This turned into a conversation about how the trash cans were scraping the parked cars in the drive way, (we were renting the space out at the time so there was less room for the trash cans, but no one\u2019s car was getting scratched,) so we ended up getting rid of the trash cans entirely so they could do what they wanted with that space. Needless to say, I have a cool/cold relationship with them and I do hold grudges, so I might be the asshole. Which brings me to today; I saw my neighbor once again driving out of the driveway on my side of the shared driveway so I sent him an email and asked him to stop doing this, and instead just move his wife\u2019s car forward and park behind it. He sent me an email reply and he was livid!! He told me that he was surprised by my email, \u201cwondered if I had read the condo bylines saying that it was common space\u201d and how he shovels the sidewalk and is a good neighbor\u2026 etc, he was ready to go to war! (I also shovel and clean the backyard, so he\u2019s not the only one\u2026) He\u2019s a lawyer and looooves to lawyer us in conversations, I guess to impress or threaten or whatever. I\u2019m not sure what I should say, or if I should reply, I definitely want to deescalate his outrage, but I also feel like I have a point. But I could be blinded by my history with them, and my dislike for them. Eveyone else seems to find them to be fine, so I could be a the one in the wrong\u2026 so, AITA?",

My father left my home several years ago, and my mother is a housewife, so I'm the breadwinner of the family. I work as an artist who makes commissions for others. A couple months ago, I found this girl (19f) on a shared Discord server and friended her. I introduced myself, showed her a couple of my art pieces, and asked her if she wanted to submit a commission so that I can make her something. She said she wasn't sure and wanted some time, which I respected. A couple days later I sent her another message and she said that she wasn't interested. I got desperate since I was struggling financially so I told her about my circumstances and asked her to help me. She was sympathetic and commissioned me. We started talking after that. I told her about my goal at the end of the month and she promised to help me. I said I wanted to try myself first. I learned that she was saving up for college and to move out of her parents' home. A month later, I reminded her of the promise she made. She told me that she was saving up, so I told her to just send me a fraction of that. I asked her for some financial support a few more times, whether to help me with a company idea, or because my brother was being hospitalized, and she did. Last month, I found out that one of my close friends (17f) who was also low-income had a getting hospitalized from a life-threatening condition. I was worried about her and wanted to help, so I told her about my online friend. After that, I texted the online explaining the situation and asked her to send some financial support. She said no, saying that she as much as my life sucked, I can't just keep asking money from her, since she also needed it for college and rent, and she can try to help me with finding some options but to stop asking her. I got pretty desperate because I wanted to help my friend, so I pleaded with her. In the end, she said that this would be the last time that she'd do this and sent it. Today, I tried my online friend but I found out that I was blocked. I still had her Discord, so I made a new account and tried to text her. When I told her who I was, she told me to leave her alone. I was shocked, because she's normally very sweet and kind, so I asked what happened. She explained that her parents found out and got mad at her, and she already told on a few different occasions that she was uncomfortable with sending me money, especially since she barely knew me, and made her feel like she was a bad person for feeling that way. I tried to apologize and promised that I wouldn't do that again, but she didn't trust my word and blocked me. I felt awful and explained to my mother what happened. She told me that while what I intended to do was good, I can't just ask people to share their money with me. So I'm just wondering, AITA?",

My parents are away, time zones make our days/nights flipped (sis and I live in the same TZ). After the party around 1AM, I call the family chat and mom and sis picked up - I called to debrief on the engagement. Mom mentioned that our cousin was sick and that her dad went to a party alone (family birthday, which I knew about). She mentioned the party was the day before and I fixated on that - we had a quick back and forth about the date of the party - \u00a0this convo was 2 mins max, being very generous. \u00a0Sis apparently asked 4 times, what party? When mom and I finished the convo, I immediately answered sis and that's when I realized she'd disconnected. I thought maybe her phone died/Internet issue and continued talking to mom about the engagement because I figured I'd talk to my sis during the day, but wasn't sure when I'd speak to mom again. I even messaged right away asking what was wrong and why she wasn't on the call. But like I said, I thought it wasn't intentional and it's late, so whatever. I call my sis later on Sunday in the PM and ask what happened. Paraphrasing here, but the gist is, she said she didn't have to waste her time on the call when people are ignoring her and that it was extremely rude to not answer her when she asked four times and she was tired of being made insignificant. I got upset because if she had waited another minute, I would have answered. Sis said I should have answered immediately - that in the back and forth, one of us could have responded. I asked what was wrong with us finishing this minor thread before responding. There was a fight and we didn't talk. Today, I call sis again because I know she would be interested in the gossip and there were some things I wanted to run by her. However, I was still really frustrated by everything and after a little chit chat, I started the topic by mentioning along the lines that if my sist had been a little patient, I wouldn't have to go over this again. She blew up at me that she was tired of feeling insignificant and having her questions ignored. I responded again that 2 mins is not that long of a time and it just devolved again - I said something like it's a waste of time to repeat an hour long convo for this reason and she twisted it into I'm saying it's a waste of time talking to her. But then, I'm thinking, well, you thought it was a waste of your time to wait for 2 minutes, so why can't I think it's a waste to spend an hour rehashing everything? I get having to repeat convos/stories separately with my mom and my sis, but that's normally because one person wasn't available. But in this case, she was on the call and I feel this was a really petty reason to hang up. So, AITA because I did not immediately answer my sister's question instead of at the end of a conversation thread that lasted max 2 minutes?",

Our provider has options to get certain amounts of data limits, like 200gb, 300gb etc. We got the 300gb option, and it usually lasts for 30-25 days, this month it lasted 10 (they don't cut access just make it slower).

        "selftext": "Hi reddit! First of all, english is not my first language, so i apologize if something is not written correctly. So me (17 years old female) and my family (Dad [47 years old] and brother [10 years old]) went on a short trip of 1 night and 2 days last week. We went to a near town (aproximately 1 or 2 hours in car from where we live) located on the coast of a river. This is a very small town and it only has a few bars and restaurants to have lunch and dinner.  The thing is, we were at a bar, and there were two musicians playing guitar and percussion and singing, and they where playing a few requests from the crowd. At some point, my dad suggested to my brother that he could ask the musicians to play a song from a band that my brother loves. My brother didn't know if he wanted to tell the musicians to play a song, so my dad went to ask them. When he came back, my dad said (and i don't know if this is true or if my dad just said it to cheer my brother up) that the musicians told him that they didn't know the lyrics of the songs of this band, and that my brother would have to sing (my brother said that he would sing if he had to).  The thing is, this band is well known in the country where i live, however is more like a niche band, even though it is known. The thing is that musicians were playing (and the crowd were asking) for popular songs that everyone knows, so i thought that it could clash with the atmosphere. And my brother doesn't sing very well. So at some point i told my brother that no one wants to hear him sing, and i told him to not sing. My dad told me that i shouldn't say that, and after that my brother said that he was agree with me and that he doesn't sing very well.  He didn't sing after all, but i was wondering if i went to far when i told my brother that. It's just that it would have been so cringe if he had sung, but if that happened, i could have easily left the bar and go to the hotel (to 200 meters of the bar), because as i said, is a small town. My brother doesn't seem affected for what i said, but i thought that maybe i owe him an apology, AITA?   EDIT: Thanks for your comments! I've been reading every single one of them, i apreciate your opinions. Special thanks for those who shared their opinions respectfully.  I accept the judgment; i was an asshole in this situation, i said something hurtful and unnecesary that i should have kept to myself. I will apologize with my brother, and i will make breakfast for him tomorrow (i usually don't make him breakfast) with the foods that he likes as an apology. Again, thanks to everyone for sharing your thoughts here. That said, i will uninstall reddit for my own mental health. Some comments were really rude and i don't feel comfortable here anymore, so im going to prioritize my mental health, because i realized that im not prepared to dealing with some of the comments. I were nice to everyone who i answered, so i just will keep wishing everybody a lovely day \u2661 Again, thanks for everything.",

My cousins started leaving me out and i was low-key getting pissed off but i didn't say anything. We all went outside for a walk and when i came back into the driveway, my mom was there, smoking a cigarette. My mom noticed that something was wrong with me. She started interrogating me and trying to coax an answer out of me. I start crying out of distress because she kept berating me about something that didn't even happen. She leaves me alone for a bit and promises we'll leave as soon as she gets all the tupperware. I was in the car trying to calm myself. Once I do that, i go back inside expecting to see my mother ready to go. She explains that my Aunt was in the shower and wanted my mom to stay. I just said whatever and went back upstairs. Everyone around her was drunk and I was nervous at the thought my mom would also get drunk and try to drive me home. I also just really don't like drunk adults, they scare me (this also connects to the fact that last time everyone was drunk there was a fight and my uncle got hurt.) . I go upstairs for about another hour. I walk down the steps and peak my head over to peer at my mom who was sitting at the table. She was drinking out of a plastic cup and i felt my heart drop to my stomach. There was also a beer bottle sitting on the counter. She reassured me earlier that she was drinking Pepsi but my anxiety was taking no mercy at the time. I calmly walk upstairs to the bathroom and pace back and forth for a while. I pace up and down the steps, peering over once again. I just decide to go outside and talk my anger out. I go outside and grab a random box and bend it and kick it. It didn't help. I walk back in the house with everyone in the kitchen staring at me (probably because i was acting like a fucking lunatic). I go back into my cousins room to calm myself. after about 30 minutes i get impaitent and go to peer over the stairs again. they were all still drinking and my mom promised we'd leave 2 hours ago. I begin pacing again, scream into a pillow, and then i start feeling like i cant breath. so i run downstairs telling my mom i cant breath and she's acting like it's nothing (probably because i've embarrassed her enough). She then finally decides to go and i get yelled at from the moment we walked out the door to the minute we get home. I understand it was bratty and i still get her snarky comments about it from time to time. I think i'm the asshole. I just wanted to get this off my chest.",

She pays her 3rd share 600/month of the rent and she pays the entirety of the internet bill which is about 116/month. She is paid about 50k/year as a maintenance tech for apartments. About 5 nights a week she will come home with her girlfriend and play video games, if they come home early enough they partake in what I have made for dinner, otherwise they will shut themselves in the bedroom till morning. The other two nights the girlfriend stays at her place and stepdaughter comes alone, same routine though. I want to ask for her share in the power bill,  water bill, and gas. I know her argument will be that she can\u2019t afford it. She has had several car accidents and so her car insurance is high. She has a monthly car payment and she takes care of her cats. I can\u2019t think of another expense she would have.Maybe this is a no-brainer. I hate talking about money and would honestly just keep it bottled up and look the other way. But one reason I need to bring it up is that I haven\u2019t been working since July. I was laid off at the same time I found I was pregnant and decided to just coast until I had the baby to look for work. Our savings is running out and things are about to get more difficult.

        "selftext": "Hi, I (M26) have lived with my gf (F25) for the past three years. I had to discover in the hard way that we have different standards as to what counts as an \u2018empty\u2019 toothpaste. This is what happened. I went to brush my teeth before bed, when I saw that the toothpaste is empty. Meaning, I couldn\u2019t squeeze out any more paste on my toothbrush (and I try pretty hard, I squeeze it and twist it and stuff). So, I just threw the pack out and went to sleep. I don\u2019t remember the chronology of events exactly but I must have emptied the trash before sleep as well, because the toothpaste was \u2018unsalvegable\u2019 according to my gf. Anyway, she burst into the room super angry, asking where the tooth paste went. I say it is in the trash because it was empty. She then calls me a \u2018cancer-whore\u2019 (it was in Dutch, but I understood). She says: \u201chow could you do that when we have no replacement?\u201d, \u201cI have to go to work tomorrow and I won\u2019t have clean teeth\u201d, etc. She works as a teacher and is conscious of her breath.  Here you need to know something about her - she likes to shop for necessities (rice, pasta, toothpaste, tomato cans, etc) in bulk when they\u2019re on sale, so we often have a stash of this stuff in the attic. It\u2019s a nice thing that she does that of course, but it has conditioned me to not check for these things because I just assume we have some in the attic. Anyway, I must have thrown it out, realized there is no replacement in the attic, and then shrugged and went to sleep. I\u2019m thinking: \u201cwhat can you do, right?\u201d During our argument, I find out that she would have cut the toothpaste tube in half with scissors and carved out any paste inside that way. To me, this is a different standard, and maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m a guy, but I don\u2019t see the big deal in brushing your teeth with just water for one evening and one morning.  She brings up that the same thing happened with her face wash a year ago. She had cut it in half before, and I threw it out because it looked broken to me. It had resulted in a similar fight back then. I guess I had forgotten about that, but I do try to pay attention to that kind of stuff. So, long story short, is she overreacting, or am I being ignorant of her needs?  ",

There has been lots of issues and for the longest time I\u2019ve said I will break up with him. We have been together for 4 years, so I have sort of created the problem I am in now. We spent Christmas and new years apart as I really don\u2019t get along with his family. Because of our jobs we are also currently living about 4 hours away so just this week I finally got to see him, I went over to his.  My parents had picked up on the time that my bf has spent here where I live, that I tend to pay for most things, and although we aim to do 50-50 split, for the most part he was earning about 2x than what I make and we still even split but I\u2019d end up paying for most things when we are out.  So my parents are concerned about this, I don\u2019t know what to do because I\u2019m very attached but here is where I might be the asshole: I showed my mom some jewellerymy partner gave me for Christmas. This was after about 3 years of hints as he never spent more than \u00a340 on gifts but spends lots on booze and again the gifts I gave him were far far more than what he spent on me.  My mom started making fun of the jewlerry, pointing out it was a fake. She also pointed out how my brother was about to get me the same jewellery over Christmas as it was on 50% sale. She also mentioned how much of a cheap ass he was, and how naive I was too take the jewellery. I didn\u2019t actually know if it was fake or not I was pleased he got me something other than candles. Even tho I agree a bit with her I snapped and told her she was a horrible person and that she had raised me to be like this so she should stop asking the world to treat me like a princess when she treats me like shit (her main argument is that I deserve more attention and thoughtfulness from a bf).The conversation obviously escalated and we both said some nasty things, I particularly said \u201cright cause your life is so hard we all have to be miserable with you?\u201d Bc my mom is going through a particularly rough job situation and I also said \u201cmaybe if you treated me better I would think I deserve more\u201d this is coming of the backend of my mom always been very a volatile parent. I also said I hated her and that she was just like her mom, and she was probably end up on her own as she pushes everyone away. I\u2019m not proud of what I said but writing it out so I\u2019m honest about the situation. She apologised profusely after it but I\u2019m very butt hurt about the whole situation.

Recently, in my history class, me and her got sat next to each other, which got us talking again. I knew that she had a pretty bad past, especially with lying and blackmailing people, so I was very careful on what I told her. She's pretty much unpredictable, and I thought she changed (being the naive person I am). I have a best friend who we'll call Barbara. Barbara and her boyfriend have been together for a few months now, and are in a healthy and happy relationship. Amelia knows that they're dating, but refuses to stop flirting with Barbara's boyfriend.

It's kinda like she's a pick me, but I don't wanna put it that way. Recently, Amelia began to flirt with Samuel, which I did not appreciate. I told her I didn't like how she always said that he looked good today, or how she messed with his hair even when he told her to stop. I know that they've been friends for a while, but I can't help but get jealous. It's like she's wants to frustrate me. Amelia expressed that she would stop; which I appreciated. But what she did was worse, and she began putting him down. She called him stupid, ugly, and always gagged everytime she was him. That annoyed me even more, because she could at least have some decent respect for him. I made a instagram post, talking about how Amelia made me feel and other things about her that annoy me. I guess my other friend showed her and told her, because the next day Amelia came up to me and started talking about how I was rude for saying all of that. I told her that I didn't appreciate her rude comments, and she said she understood, but literally as I was going to history, she was already talking in her annoying voice and saying Ewww! Get away from me! You're disgusting and look like a fucking pig. I got really mad at her, and pulled her aside, and started berating her about what she said and how she promised she would stop. She simply rolled her eyes, and mumbled a small apology before going back to our friends and giggling with them. So AITA?",

        "selftext": "I (16M) am a junior in high school, I play baseball I\u2019m the starting Center Fielder on my schools varsity team (I play every position besides catcher but I\u2019m a primary outfielder), I\u2019ve been a varsity starter since I was a freshman. Last year I hit .332 with 5 HR\u2019s and 22 XBH\u2019s and a .993 fielding pct, I was ranked as the second best prospect in the state last year(the one above me is a senior who graduated last year)  I work really hard, I try to train at least 3-4 times a day wake up at like 5 lift for 45 minutes to an hour, ( I have weights  in the garage), leave for school at 7:15, during lunch drive home eat something then hit off a tee and do hitting drills (I get an hour for lunch and have a free block right after lunch so I have about 2 hours) after school practice or in the offseason go to the gym, come home eat dinner, do my homework make sure I\u2019m caught up on my schoolwork and go outside and hit off a tee and do more hitting drills for at least 90 minutes. I have a strict nutrition plan I follow, I normally do 2 cheat days a month and 1 rest day a week (I also stretch and ice my muscles before I go to sleep I know recovery is important) I want to play in college and in the mlb so I work hard towards that goal and try to get a little bit better everyday and stay disciplined eat right, train hard everyday even when I don\u2019t want to, and Just stay laser focused on that goal and block out all distractions. Yesterday was my sister\u2019s(14F) birthday my family went  out to dinner, I didn\u2019t go, my teammates were going to a batting cage (we go every Saturday) and I had to go to that, to me missing practice or work outs isn\u2019t an option getting better everyday is what\u2019s most important, the way I see it is this: I have one goal be the best baseball player I can possibly be, anything outside that lane I don\u2019t have time for, baseball for me is the most important thing. When I told my parents I couldn\u2019t go and I had practice they said I could miss one practice and I said I can\u2019t. Slacking and missing practice isn\u2019t an option until I\u2019m the best plain and simple. Last night I went to the facility worked for a few hours and stayed after and got extra work in and went home, and my parents were upset saying I could have missed 1 practice for a special occasion, I don\u2019t think so I\u2019m not the best so that means there are no off days there is no missing practice I\u2019m not injured, I\u2019m not sick so there\u2019s no reason not to go it\u2019s not that I don\u2019t care about my family or anything but I\u2019ve got a goal I\u2019ve got a dream and that comes first no matter what. But I\u2019m not sure AITA?",

        "selftext": "Hi,Single mom here with two kids and an on again and off partner. He is currently unemployed and the primary caretaker of our children while I work an average of 10-12 hours a day. All bills are on me and most days I\u2019m overwhelmed but so is he with two rambunctious children. In our old home he had a job but never contributed to bills and instead did fun things with the kids like pay for museum tickets and the zoo etc so I didn\u2019t mind. This month things are really tight, our eldest needed braces (she\u2019s under 10 y/o) and that was an unexpected expense. Anyway, when we moved into the house- the old tenants left a tv mount above the fireplace. The previous owner told us that it\u2019s difficult to remove because this is an old house with sensitive walls. After living here for about a month and a half my partner (without consulting me) decides to take down the wall mount. Ok- no problem\u2026 but he tells me he won\u2019t fill in the massive holes tonight. I ask when then? He storms off and doesn\u2019t say a thing. I already feel bamboozled with this house, so many things have broken and I\u2019ve been paying for them to be replaced or repaired. To hear, that a perfectly fine mount was removed for absolutely no reason is gut wrenching, especially after the repair costs I\u2019ve had to endure. Now I\u2019ve hired a task rabbit who will arrive in a few days to fill/sand/and paint this atrocious hole situation.  my partner is mad that I am paying for this. The last project at the previous house included building a cat corridor and dragging giant pieces of wood across my laundry room walls and never fixing it.  I know financially it isn\u2019t the best time to pay for ANOTHER repair so I feel like an asshole, however, I don\u2019t think I should feel that way because I was so excited for this home and it\u2019s already been a pain without my partners shenanigans. tldr; partner put holes in the walls by removing the TV mount without discussion and is mad that I\u2019m paying for the repair because \u201che\u2019ll get around to fixing it\u201d am I the asshole?   Am I the asshole for paying a handyman?",

        "selftext": "My boyfriend and I have been dating for a few months now, and things are going really well. We share a lot of common interests, and even when we differ, we enjoy learning from each other. We\u2019ve also set some boundaries, like keeping PDA to just holding hands and not bringing up each other\u2019s pasts unless it\u2019s mentioned first by said party. However, there's one small thing that really bothers me, even though it\u2019s not really that big of a deal. I get really anxious about phone calls. Whenever my phone rings, I instantly think there\u2019s something urgent or serious going on. I\u2019ve talked to my boyfriend about it, and while he\u2019s the opposite and loves calling people (since he thinks it\u2019s quicker and more personal than texting), I\u2019ve asked him to text me before calling if it\u2019s just for a casual conversation. This way, I can relax, knowing it\u2019s not an emergency, and decide if I\u2019m available to talk. It\u2019s also helpful because if I\u2019m in the middle of something, I can either finish what I\u2019m doing or let him know I\u2019ll call him back later. When he calls without texting first, I get stressed, and I don\u2019t like letting it go to voicemail because I worry something\u2019s wrong. And thus, no matter what I\u2019m doing, I will always stop everything to answer a call. A quick text helps me calm down. And don\u2019t get me wrong\u2026 I\u2019d love to hear him on the phone. Just, a text first would be nice. Recently, he called me without texting first, but it was for an emergency, so I didn\u2019t mind. However, since then, he\u2019s continued calling without texting, and while he apologizes when it happens, it still bothers me. I don\u2019t want to say anything because he\u2019s still dealing with said emergency that happened earlier, but I\u2019m starting to feel upset. I\u2019m unsure if I should just let it go since 1) its not a big deal, and 2) it\u2019s part of his character to call instead of text, or if I should ask him to change this for me. It\u2019s a small thing, but it\u2019s starting to weigh on me a bit. AITA?",

        "selftext": "So I(16F) was at a sleepover with my friends, the plan was to stay at one friends house until Sunday and her mama would drop me off. But her mother had to go to another town because of a family emergency and didn\u2019t want us home alone. So we went to another friend\u2019s house and planned for her mom to pick us up in the morning to go back to the FIRST house. I sleep in bc Im not expecting to get pick up until Sunday. Well I get woken up to them saying my mom called and I had to go, and she was at the house we weren\u2019t anymore. i ended up calling her to let her know Im at others friend house. So I get picked up and she tells me as soon as I get in the car that since I \u201clied\u201d about where I was, I won\u2019t be having no more sleepovers for weeks. In the car I tried to explain what happened but she cut me off saying how she didn\u2019t care about my why. Like she has this story in her head and wants to keep it like that.  So I wait until the next day and I asked her if I can go back over and DONT have to spend the night and she said no bc I wasn\u2019t where I was supposed to be and I should have let her know I was moving from one place to the other. I told her I understand but it slipped my mind and she wasnt even supposed to pick me up to even be so upset about the situation. And she was just like \u201cwell ima do what ima do and see look, u wasn\u2019t where you was supposed to be\u201d like shes always tryna caught me being bad. I kept telling her that texting her slipped my mind cus I was with friends and I was safe and she had my snap location so I didn\u2019t think it was the biggest deal in the world and there were adult/parents there but she didn\u2019t care and just kept saying she doesn\u2019t care about the why and that I should have Jst let her know.  I told her it\u2019s unfair cause she\u2019s making it seem intentional when everything Jst sorta happened and she again said she didn\u2019t care if it was or wasn\u2019t intentional i tell should have \u201ctold her I was moving\u201d and I told her I\u2019ll do better next time and it\u2019s was jst a mistake and she said ima Jst have to \u201ctake my L\u201d and sit in my decision BUT IT WASNT MY DECISION AND SHES MAKING IT SEEM LIKE ITS MY FAULT WHEN SHE LITERALLY HAS MY LOCATION ON SNAP! Everyone else can make a mistake but as soon as I make one it\u2019s so horrible. And she said I won\u2019t be able to go out or have anymore sleepovers for WEEKS?! I feel like the punishment is unfair especially this being the FIRST time it happened. And it was never that deep. ",

        "selftext": "Hi everyone. My (38f) sister (51f) (let's call her Jenny) has 5 children who are now all adults: 31m, 30m, 28f, 27m, 24m. Three of those children (30m, 28f, 27m) have either very limited contact with their mother or refuse to have contact at all. She thinks they are being selfish and ungrateful, but they all have valid reasons for not being in contact. Her daughter (let's call her Lily) now has a young child of her own and, thanks to her unwanted advances from her former housemate, she's in emergency accommodation while she waits for social housing. She has been in emergency accommodation since before Christmas.  My husband (42m) and I offered her, and her child, the use of our spare room until she gets on her feet, but she declined it because it would lower her chances of being provided her own place. The problem is that she doesn't have her own car. We have lent her my husband's car and have promised her that we would help her get a car and that we would initially pay for it, but that she would have to work off her debt by doing some cleaning and maintenance for us, and she has happily agreed.  This whole time, her mother, Jenny has shown little interest in her daughter. They don't have the best relationship as it is, and Lily feels constantly let down by Jenny. With permission from Lily, I have been updating Jenny on the situation, which has led to Jenny complaining that she only hears about Lily's situation from me. Today I  asked her if she'd be willing to spend some of her savings (that she told me about) to help get Lily a car. She was angry with me for making that suggestion while not telling Lily that she had to start spending time with Jenny.  Jenny also said that she'd been asked to do this by another sister and that she was looking for cars as we speak despite not being aware of the requirements of a car. Apparently, she wants to tell Lily  that if she wants money for a car then Lily has to let Jenny  have access to the grandchild.  Lily has not once asked Jenny for help, it is all coming from me. I told Jenny that HER daughter was HER responsibility, not mine, and that she needed to reach out and help her.  Here's where I might be TA, I was a little rude in our conversation which was over text message. I stand by what I wrote (that she had to step up and provide for her adult child), but I wasn't very kind and I let my growing frustration bubble over and it showed in the texts.  Tl;Dr: niece (and niece's child) is stranded in emergency accommodation, I told her mother to step up and provide assistance. My husband and I are planning to sell a car to her for much less than it's worth and asked her mother to contribute to the car. I was a little rude when I asked her mother to help. AITA?",

        "selftext": "So I had made plans for a football match with one of my friends, some people he wanted to bring along and my girlfriend. I bought the tickets and the seats for myself,my girlfriend and my friend. Today, match-day, I get a text from my friend (who is also our driver for today) saying that he doesn't think he will come to the match, long story short he isn't getting the desirable result in his college grades and he and his parents got in an argument, basically he canceled saying that he has gone out a lot these past few days and exams are coming up. At first I tried to support him telling him that everyone is different and it's okay if he's a bit behind, to not be hard on himself since I felt he was guilt-tripping himself. And I tried to persuade him saying that a few hours won't change anything and that it's wrong to limit yourself and deprive yourself of fun and free time just because you feel bad about not studying, it's Sunday night, you can study another day, or before the match. Basically canceling now won't solve the problem, nor make it better. You can both go out now and fix your studying schedule, it doesn't have to be either/or. We got nowhere and I got kind of mad at him, I told him he is fucking me, because I've been working all week and I haven't gone out at all, I'm also studying in college at the same time, and I've been planning this whole week for this Sunday, and I felt like I was getting punished for his bad habits, and I felt disrespected by him for not respecting my time and the fact that we had planned something mutually and he canceled the same day, a few hours before. He got defensive after that and started telling me that college is more important(than the fact that he canceled) and that he is really behind, and it's none of my business, he is not coming and that's final. AITA? Because I did feel bad about lashing out at him but at the same time I've worked all week, I'm doing okay at college, and this is the only night out I'll have all week, I felt that it's irresponsible from him to cancel on me and I felt like I was getting punished for being good at keeping my schedule. I'll end up going with my girlfriend, the two of us, so it's not all bad, but i felt if didn't make it a big deal he would do it again.",

We did not date for very long. We talked for about a month before making it official, were boyfriends for a month, then Del broke up with me on New Year\u2019s. My other roommate (20M), let\u2019s call him Jay, had some opinions about our relationship from the beginning. It was mostly that he was uncomfortable with living with a couple. I will admit, the first week, we would often cuddle on the couch, but we ended up moving to Del\u2019s room because Del confronted our other roommates about how they really felt. From then on, we would generally only do \u201ccouple things\u201d in each other\u2019s rooms. There would still be the occasional flirting and hugging outside of our rooms, however. After we broke up, I confided in Jay because I still saw him as a friend. He said that he felt bad but was also glad we broke up. Fast forward to about 2 weeks later, me and Jay went out to lunch with another friend and my breakup became the topic of the conversation. The other friend was the one who brought it up. Again, Jay said he was glad we broke up. I didn\u2019t say anything at the table because I was super flustered hearing that again. I texted Jay later that night after cooling down. I texted the following: \u201ccan you tell me what you meant by u guys are glad we broke up cuz its more chill now? im not trying to start shit im just needing some type of clarity cuz if im being honest that genuinely felt like a fucked up thing to say\u201d Jay apologized, but it was more of a \u201csorry you felt that way\u201d apology. He also said he was \u201cjust being real.\u201d  Then, I also told Jay that it wasn\u2019t good that he tried to \u201cspare our feelings\u201d by not telling us about how he really felt while me and Del were dating and that what he said shouldn\u2019t have come up at the table in public with another friend. Jay said he didn\u2019t spare anyone\u2019s feelings and just wanted to avoid drama and that his comment was completely appropriate because the conversation was about the breakup. Am I the asshole?",

Often after these events it\u2019s late at night and I don\u2019t want to drive an hour to go home so I stay at her apartment. sometimes me and my sister have plans the next day so it saves money, time, energy, etc. The problem is she has two roommates; Jane and Sally.  Recently Jane has had some problems with me staying over on the couch. She says that she\u2019ll have to walk past me to get to the bathroom in the middle of the night and doesn\u2019t want to have to deal with a man in the house. Sally hasn\u2019t said anything on the issue and it\u2019s mainly Jane that has the problem. Jane has said that it\u2019s okay for me to stay the night if I give a week advance notice and I can only stay once every other week. also my sister has to sleep on the couch and I stay in my sisters bedroom so that Jane doesn\u2019t expose herself to me on her late night bathroom trips. There are a few other things to note: me and my sister are step siblings (so it would be a little weird to share a room) everyone involved is Christian and a boy staying over is a little awkward already. And lastly Jane has a boyfriend Dave who often comes over and stays late into the night. I should also include that Dave is a leader of a Christian frat where it is strictly forbidden to stay the night with girls, however they have a 2am curfew and he leaves  before that. (But once while I stayed on the couch he stayed until the morning, this was relayed to one of his leaders and he got into some trouble for it) I stayed last Friday when nobody was there but me and my sister and I want to go line dancing again on Thursday but I\u2019m not a big fan of driving for an hour at 1am because Jane doesn\u2019t want me to stay over.

They got married in a different country (17+ hour long flights to that country from where I live) and I would have to take 1-2 weeks off school to attend. I didn't want to fall behind and have my grades suffer since good grades are important for getting into a good college and good graduate school.

It started with around $360 per month, and later went up to $400, plus the water and electricity bills (around $10-15). Over the last months, he did pay for the water and electricity bills, but that was it.I have the privilege of my mother helping me out financially, and I also know that my bf doesn't earn very much, so I never complained about this rent situation. Also, while I paid for the flat, he paid for almost all of our groceries and daily expenses, so in the end our monthly spendings felt balanced.I never ONCE said anything about him not paying the rent. Not ONCE did I even mention it, because I was perfectly okay with the situation. I know my mother didn't like it very much that we weren't splitting the rent equally, but there's her opinion, and there's my opinion, and I personally NEVER did or said anything to make him feel guilty or unwelcome in this flat.But about a month ago I found myself in a tight spot. I quit my job in hopes of getting a better paying one, but it didn't work out, so I had to shrink my expenses, while I was looking for a new job. For the first time in our relationship, I asked my bf for help with the rent. I said, that he could give me $50, he could give me $10, any amount, it doesn't matter, because all of it would be incredibly helpful. I said, that he was in no way obligated to give me anything at all, if he felt like he wasn't in the place to do that at the moment. I said that if not, I could absolutely continue paying the whole price by myself, and it would not be a problem.He did give me $50.And two or three days later, while both of us were at home, my mother called me. Among other things, she asked whether my bf was helping me pay the rent this month. I answered, in a perfectly calm tone, with no underlying emotion whatsoever, that he gave me $50. And that was the end of that conversation.But since my bf was home too, he heard everything. And he didn't bring it up at first, but later when he left for work, he texted me that he would be moving out to live with his mother. He said that he didn't have enough money to start splitting the rent with me, but because of that fucking phone conversation he now felt too guilty for not paying, to continue living with me.Yes, I did tell him it was bullshit, that I didn't blame him for anything, and that I would really want him to stay, but he didn't listen.We keep in touch and we technically haven't broken up. I miss him so fucking much, and I love him more than anything in the world, and I never cared about the damn rent.I've been trying to convince him to come back since then, but so far he's not budging. I can't stop blaming myself for having that phone conversation, and for unintentionally shaming him. I feel like the absolute shittiest person in the world, which destroyed my own happiness :)",

        "selftext": "Today, after going to the gym, my parents and I had an appointment with a math tutor to see if I was eligible and what I could gain. My grades aren't awful (B\u2019s-C\u2019s), but I don\u2019t understand a lot of the fundamentals and I do terribly on tests. I\u2019m in geometry, which is normal for my age.  My dad (58M) dropped me off at the appointment, and after I finished a test to assess my math skills, I was bored and decided to go get food. I couldn\u2019t find a place to sit, so I texted my mom (51F)to complain a bit, mostly just because I wanted to talk to her. When my parents came back, I called my dad to find him, and when I finally did, I was upset because he told me there *was* seating in Fry\u2019s (my mom must\u2019ve told him about the texts). I had just walked around for 10 minutes trying to find a seat, so I didn\u2019t believe him and was frustrated. We started arguing, and my mom shut it down saying, Why are we arguing over bullshit? I felt embarrassed because there were little kids around, and I was still upset. After we met with the tutor inside and we were walking out I told them the tutoring might not work (I know, I was being stupid) On the drive home, I was venting to my mom (I usually talk to her about my dad), but then she started screaming at me. She called me a bunch of names cunt,bitch,disgusting and a narcissist and ungrateful for everything they do for me. I tried to explain that I was just nervous about the tutoring situation, but she kept berating me. She complained about being busy, driving me around for things like swimming practice, a sport I don\u2019t enjoy or want to do. I find it hard to feel sorry for her when a lot of the stress is self-inflicted. She is also choosing to have two jobs and keeps saying she has no time for herself (my dad makes enough for my family to live comfortably and her income is not much, but we respect it because she \u201clikes to be busy\u201d she says) At one point, I snapped and called her childish and narcissistic, and she flipped out even more. When we got home, I felt a bit bad, so I apologized to my dad and thanked him for signing me up for tutoring, even though he reassured me that he wasn\u2019t upset. Now I\u2019m feeling confused. I\u2019ve forgiven my mom for everything in the past, but it feels like she really hates me, and I don\u2019t know why. I\u2019m wondering if I was justified in calling her childish and narcissistic, or if I should have just let it go and kept my mouth shut.  AITA?",

        "selftext": "Yes hi hello, so I\u2019m 21f and he\u2019s a 23m, been together for 2 years moved in together August 2023, and 2024 was a nightmare for us, so much so that we\u2019re in couples therapy. I wanted him to go to individual therapy, but he said I have issues too but I can\u2019t afford therapy for myself, which is why we\u2019re in couples. I don\u2019t like it only because I feel like we\u2019d be better if we individually got therapy but he\u2019s insisting couples and he\u2019s paying for it. That\u2019s a little background, here\u2019s the issue: This morning I was trying to do my school work as quietly as possible to not disturb him- let\u2019s call him C for now- and all of a sudden C yelled at me \u201cHow\u2019s laundry coming up?\u201d Now I say \u201cyell\u201d loosely, it was mostly his tone that caught me off guard. I thought at first he was joking around and I replied \u201cfine, how\u2019s the stove coming?\u201d Cause C hasn\u2019t cleaned the stove in a month and a half and I hadn\u2019t put up my laundry from last night so I thought we were being funny. We weren\u2019t. He started saying \u201cit\u2019ll get done when I f*cking get up, get in here and do your laundry else it\u2019ll be in the basket for 17 f*cking days.\u201d I was at this point really upset but part of couples therapy is not saying anything mean to each other and i had nothing nice to say so I started doing laundry in the room, on the bed. Thinking C was now wide awake and gonna get up, i just threw shirts at the end of the bed by his foot just to get started, and C immediately got upset again and said \u201cThe f*ck are you doing? Obviously you\u2019re gonna wake me up if you do laundry on top of me go do it in the living room we have a couch.\u201d And waved me off.  3 hours went by and C finally got up and started asking why I did that, why I was doing an idiot move, if it was me trying to force him up or say \u201cf*ck you\u201d to him and I was already upset cause the way he talked to me previously made me feel like an idiot and all these emotions bubbled over and I screamed at him \u201cI wasn\u2019t trying to do anything I was just trying to do the laundry like you said! I don\u2019t care!\u201d  C then got mad and told me to go into another room for ten minutes to calm down and I\u2019ve been in this room crying hysterically because I just feel like I\u2019m going crazy, am I the asshole here? Am I really just so deranged I don\u2019t see what I did wrong? Please give honest answers I just really need someone outside of this to tell me what I did or didn\u2019t do. ",

        "selftext": "I (16F) recently went to visit my aunt with my mom. Aunt always treats our family to spa days when we visit. When she went to book us massages, the spa mentioned that they only service 18 and older fur full body massages. So aunt booked me a manicure, pedicure, and facial instead, while she and my mom got to have the whole works with a nice full body massage. Here\u2019s the thing, I\u2019ve had plenty of manicures and pedicures so getting them doesn\u2019t really feel very \u2018fancy spa like\u2019 or pampering. I asked my sing if she could just tell them I\u2019m 18 (since I have always been told I look a few years older) but she wouldn\u2019t.  We get to the spa and they immediately take my mom and aunt back but I had to wait almost an hour for my facial masseuse to come get me. The lady kind of rushed it, and was in a hurry to get me out of the room when she was done. The mani and pedi was nothing different from your typical nail salon visit. I then had to wait almost an hour afterward in the lobby for my mom and aunt bc they wanted to go swimming in the whirlpool and hot tubs. We went to lunch nearby afterward and my mom asked me why I was so grumpy and I said that no worries I wasn\u2019t. She then kept prying so I then broke it to her that it wasn\u2019t fair I didn\u2019t get nearly the same luxurious treatments they were bragging about on the way to lunch, just because I\u2019m younger. The mani and pedi didn\u2019t feel anything more luxurious than going to a nail salon. It also wasn\u2019t fair I had to wait over an hour in the lobby while they got to enjoy the amenities without inviting me down. My mom angrily snapped that I\u2019m also the only one if the three who doesn\u2019t work a full time job nor did I pay for any of it, and that one day when I start working and can afford it, then I can enjoy a nice treatment. She then revealed that my pedicure was $80, which I think is steep bc it was no better than a nail salon visit. My aunt didn\u2019t say anything, but WITA here? ",

        "selftext": "I have this relationship with this 50yr old man (I am 41) who is through the final stages of finalizing his divorce. We have been dating for 1 year but until today I have NOT met his 28 year old only daughter. She has been married for 4 years now and she has a 1 year old boy. It is still uncertain as to why she has not visited or responds to my boyfriend's texts or anyone on his side of the family. He believes it is because he wants to sell the house he still owns with his ex. My boyfriend's daughter, her husband and their son and my boyfriend's ex still live in that house. They were given the option to buy him out but they all want the house to be sold to them to what it was worth back on 2013. My boyfriend he just wants a fresh start.  So last year back on November my boyfriend and I we were supposed to travel along with another couple to Cancun. My boyfriend does not have the hours and flexibility to take vacations as us 3 have. He asked to postpone the trip to March so we agreed. A few days ago while attempting to schedule the trip he told me he was not ready financially and time wise and he couldn't make the month of March either. I was upset but did not say anything. So about 1 or 2 days after this he confessed how much he misses his daughter and grandson and continued to tell me he can not believe how she takes up to 1 week to answer his texts. We continued the conversation but changed the subject a little and he told me that he still pays for his ex's car insurance (which is understandable specially since divorce it's not finalized) and for their daughter's. I WAS LIVID! I was like: Who? your daughter that is married?? (I was being sarcastic as they only have her) I asked why and he said because that is her daughter and was going to continue helping her. He continued saying he only pays $100 a month for her insurance and he spends that and more every time him and I go out to eat. My boyfriend and I we NEVER talk about money and where our money goes but I have a career where I make my own money and just about 5 months ago I bought a condo with no one's help so no, I am not after his money. We do not live together (he lives with his parents) but he does buy groceries for my house here and there but does not pay for any of my bills and NEVER gives me cash nor I expect it. He continued saying that he could not believe I was talking about his daughter and I responded that I could not believe either that after how she treats him he is doing this so what about her good for nothing husband?? Is this the reason why we are not traveling on March? After my friends and I bend backwards to accommodate him? He continued saying that he confides me his issues so I can listen but not judge So AITA? I was and I'm still livid..... ",

About ten minutes ago, she came downstairs and asked me to go upstairs so she could watch 'what she wanted' aka something I can't. I get pissed off immediately and refuse to go upstairs and she shoots back with 'You've been watching TV all morning!. I still refuse to and she threatens me and says she's going to call our mom to which I reply 'Do it' because I'm pretty sure mom won't let her kick me upstairs. I think she called mom because she left for a second. When she came back down, she grabbed the remotes, connected the audio system to spotify, and blasted music before smiling and saying 'Good luck watching TV now!' before shutting her door and taking the remotes with her. And she blasted it. Like, the system was at 100(max) and it was so loud I literally almost threw up, which sounds weird, but it happened. Then after I kept turning it down to 0 and she turned it back up, she disconnected it and started playing loud music from her music player upstairs. AITA for refusing to go upstairs?",

        "selftext": "My partner and I recently started to live together at his place. He's been very accommodating and helped me feel at home ever since I moved in. There's one thing I feel we disagree on, and that's having company over every weekend.  When he was living alone he had a couple of good friends come over for drinks (nothing fancy, just catching up over a couple of beers) on a weekly basis, and he's the personification of my house is your house. They would raid the fridge, plop themselves on the couch and stay over well after midnight. They live with their parents and just like to be out of the house with every opportunity. Not an issue for me, but it's the main reason they like to come over instead of inviting us over to their place. I'm a very private person, I enjoy my own space and quiet time to decompress and relax on weekends. While I tried to also be accommodating and connect with his friends, the idea of having company and not being able to basically rot on the couch with just my partner is exhausting.  I talked to him about it and he said ok, we'll have them over when you feel like it. Thing is, I'm starting to never feel like it, it's almost a chore to me, I simply don't like people in my space. At the same time, I feel guilty about telling my partner not to have his friends over and socializing, as he's a lot more of a people person than I am.  Here's where I might be the asshole: my partner asked me to decide when to have them over because he doesn't want to impose and he wants me to be comfortable with it, so I texted them in advance and let them know we'd be having an early evening, instead of the usual. Once they left, my partner says he really enjoys their normal hangouts, and I was being antisocial for cutting it short.  We had a conversation about having people over every Saturday, and I suggested we compromise and maybe plan an evening out, have a few drinks and go back to our usual routine, at home. Or something along the lines of having them over once a month, instead of weekly. I don't want to deny my partner his need to be social and hangout with his friends, but since I'm now also living in the house, there needs to be some boundaries, and as much as I like his friends, I'm not always in the mood to share my space and not have  my quiet time for the sake of his bachelor days.",

        "selftext": "Hey Redditers! So I have a bit of an issue. Background info: me and a group of my friends are going skiing next week, taking a train up and back. There will be 11 (7 boys 4 girls) of us going up, with no parents skiing directly with us (we're all 13-14). Basically, while talking with my other friends a bit ago I came up with an amazing idea, the big group of skiers that I'm going up with soon should all wear pink tutus! It would be a great way to spot each other on the mountain that a lot of us haven't skied a lot , so we don't get lost. Also, I just thought it would be super fun and funny. Now most of us are on board with my fantabulous idea, except too boys. Let's call them Ryan and Josh. Ryan dosnt want to wear a tutu because his dad will think he's gay now I know his dad, since I was little, a cool dude really. All I can say is his dad probably wears tutus in his free time. Josh doesn't want to wear a tutu because it will mess up his confidence while skiing, and he'll look dumb and gay. Now, tbh we're all gonna mess up while skiing, and we're all friends so it doesn't matter. Also what about wearing a tutu makes you gay, and why is that a bad thing. I get that they're insecure middle school boys, but we're all friends. I have made jokes too about canceling their train ticket or pushing them off the chairlift if they don't wear one of our beautiful pink tutus (that another friend bought). They are starting to get mad. Even though they are getting mad, I can't help keep bringing up their lack of tutu enthusiasm. What should I do to get them to wear a tutu, or should I let them do their own thing. So AITA for constantly bringing up their no-go attitude for wearing tutus while skiing, because I'm being to pushy?  So uhm just to clear something up, it's a joke, sorry if my writing skills suck. We all want to wear tutus for fun, I obviously can't make the two that don't want to wear them, and wouldn't force them to wear them if they were seriously uncomfortable about it. Yea uhm my writing skills suck but I swear my intentions aren't bad haha, I'm just trying to convince some friends by writing a Reddit story haha Also it's not just me who want them to wear a tutu, everyone else does too.

When my fianc\u00e9 asked why? Lucy said I don't like her. My fianc\u00e9 got upset and told her we didn't like her spouse cuz he's not a good person and he's extremely rude. but that we put up with him because they are married. My fianc\u00e9 told me all this when I got home. I was realy angry at first cuz I don't understand how she can be so blatantly rude and ignorant. But now I feel uncomfortable someone coming to celebrate us on our wedding day that clearly doesn't support it. For background she has not liked me since my fianc\u00e9 and started dating and I can not understand why. She really only comes over when she know I won't be here. ",

The first day I moved in, got all confortable in house clothes and she brought over 4 people. I thought this was a one time affair but she kept having 1 or 2 friends over in the day. One night she brought over 3 friends and were drinking and vapibg inside and then the next day, 10 am, a girl comes over and stays the whole day AND night. The next morning I told her it's not OK to have then over so much and she kept it down for some time but then she started again. She brought a guy, which I assume is her bf and stayed over for so long, until like 10 pm. Then the next day, he stayed over overnight and didn't even have the shame to leave right away in the morning. They had breakfast together and left at 12 pm. This wasn't the only time this happened! I'm writing this sitting outside the room, and they're sleeping. It's the third day he came over and this last one he stayed overnight. For gods sake, he brought his laptop and was playing Cs last evening, not even hanging out with her.  I don't know if I should mention it to her since I did it once and I'm afraid to sour the roommate relationship with her. I guess I'm not the best roommate myself. I do tend to play video games late at night and though I try to keep quiet, I don't know if she minds it or not.  So would I be the asshole to tell her? ",

        "selftext": "Alright, Reddit, I really need your input because I\u2019m seriously starting to lose it. I (25 M) am a graduate student in CompSci in Florida, living with my two boyfriends, one is 25 and the other is 23. We\u2019re all just barely scraping by. We all graduated undergrad in CompSci, and now we\u2019re doing our Masters, hoping that maybe\u2014just maybe\u2014things will get better. But here\u2019s the thing: the job market for CompSci is absolutely DEAD. I\u2019ve applied everywhere\u2014Starbucks, Chick-Fil-A, McDonald\u2019s, Walmart, Publix\u2014hell, I\u2019ve even tried random fast food chains and retail jobs\u2014and nothing. No openings. I\u2019m so broke, I\u2019m working DoorDash, Uber, Lyft, and doing random odd jobs just to pay bills and buy food. To make matters worse, we\u2019re stuck with this shitty condo we bought five years ago when we thought life would be easier (spoiler alert: it\u2019s not). Now, we\u2019re drowning in mortgage payments, so we decided to rent out our 3-bedroom, 1-bath condo for a decent price, hoping to get some help covering the bills. Me and my boyfriends are planning to move in with the 23-year-old\u2019s parents, and we\u2019re going to share one room to save money (because who wouldn\u2019t want to live like that?). So, these three college students came by for a tour. They barely showed any interest in the place, which was whatever, but then as they left, they just stood outside and started talking about how awful the place was. Like, LOUDLY. They could\u2019ve been a little more discreet, but nope, they just tore into it. And you know what? That was the final straw for me. I\u2019ve been struggling, stressed to the max, just trying to get through school, hoping that maybe\u2014just maybe\u2014I\u2019ll be able to land a job someday (but with how things are going, who the hell knows?). I\u2019m sick of it. So I walked outside and, yes, I fucking screamed at them about how hard it is to be a college student in this economy, especially a CompSci major with no job prospects. I ranted about how I\u2019ve applied to every damn job and can\u2019t get hired anywhere, how I\u2019m doing everything I can just to survive, and how even with a Masters, I don\u2019t know if anything will actually change. I may have used some\u2026 colorful language. Now I\u2019ve got a warning from my condo\u2019s HOA, saying if I do something like that again, I\u2019ll get a $450 fine. Seriously. They want me to just sit back and take it, while I\u2019m drowning in debt and frustration? I\u2019m just tired of pretending everything\u2019s fine when it\u2019s not. So, AITA for losing it and screaming at them? I get that I shouldn\u2019t have gone off like that, but can you blame me? Everything feels like it\u2019s falling apart, and I\u2019m just trying to survive.",

She won't invite her toxic parents which I fully supported; but there were a few idiots in the family who thought she should let them come because family and let bygones be bygones; they gave her c-ptsd so I always fully supported her.  Someone gave her parents the time, date and location of the wedding (her stepbrother told her they knew and planned on showing up but wouldn't reveal who told them).  So she changed the wedding venue and date; however since she wasn't sure who did it and didn't want them to find out again she went hunting for a rat so to speak and gave 5 different faux locations to 5 different suspects I ended up being one of them. The idea being wherever the parents thought the new location would be shed figure out who told.  Turned out the real rat was our aunt.  She told me and the others the truth that we passed the test and apologized but had to sniff out a rat.  I was deeply hurt she suspected me, I've been close with her my entire life and have never done anything to betray her trust and am very hurt for being accused of something I didn't do.  I told her im resigning as a bridesmaid and won't be attending but will send a gift.  She says I'm being unfair, she's traumatized and had to sniff out who the rat was, the only other option was to either uninvite the whole family or risk a panic attack on her wedding day (she said this when I suggested hiring security) if she saw them.  I said I understand but am deeply hurt to have been treated as a bad guy when i never betrayed her trust ever nor done anything wrong in my life to her, I've been nothing but a good and loyal friend/cousin and to learn she doesn't trust me deeply hurt.

        "selftext": "My (33M) close friend (37m) is a season ticket holder at Dodger stadium and got tickets to World Series game 1, inviting me to the game for his face value. I happily accepted and asked if I could pay him back in installments, which he agreed to, and we had a great time. When the dodgers won the championship, he then invited me to the Championship celebration for his face value and this, being much cheaper, I paid him for immediately. Once again, we had a great time, however, after the celebration we both noticed that the plastic beer cups they gave out after the game were pretty great memorabilia and I saw one near me that I grabbed with the intention of washing it and using it at home. He looked around and didn\u2019t see another and asked me if he could have the one I grabbed. I laughed and said \u201cno, this is mine.\u201d He appeared frustrated, but I then went to search for a second cup for him. In the process of searching, we got separated and we left without the chance to say goodbye.  We live in different parts of the state and don\u2019t talk too often, but a month and a half later he calls me and says he wants to express some resentment he has with me for my behavior. He expresses that he believes I should have happily given him the cup given that he got me the face value tickets to both events when he could have easily made money by selling the tickets on the second market and instead he was kind enough to sell them to me. He was also very turned off by my reaction having laughed at the idea of giving him the cup saying that he felt I was disrespectful. I apologized and said that I intended no disrespect, but also said that I definitely didn\u2019t owe him the cup as I paid the same amount he did and it was his choice to sell me the tickets and not take the profit. He disagreed and we moved on after I offered him the cup because in all honesty, it\u2019s a $5 cup and not that important to me. He declined it saying it\u2019s the principle of the matter. Now I am sitting here feeling frustrated because this all feels like such a silly thing to hold a resentment over. The fact that he had this resentment towards me for a month and a half and felt the need to talk about it so long after the fact just feels petty and it\u2019s hard for me to take seriously.  So AITA for finding this whole situation ridiculous and being frustrated this he feels so easily disrespected over such minor grievances? Also, did I owe him the cup? Edit: I do want to say that I was incredibly grateful to my friend for everything. I paid for parking which was $50. I thanked him profusely. I posted pictures on instagram of us together where I expressed my gratitude, etc. There is an assumption being made that I wasn\u2019t grateful and I was, I just didn\u2019t respond with that for the cup instance. Idk if that makes a difference, but there you go!",

I ticked him off a little too much for \u201cnot respecting the other people in the building\u201d and I was kicked out I had three days to clear everything out. I had also just lost my job working at the local grocery store, so I had no home and no job, just an internship at a real estate agency which I was only getting $10 an hour from; I was struggling. Luckily, one of my friends (27M) who I have known since high school offered to let me stay in their house while I found a place to live and a new job. Once, I was moved in, he said that it was nice to have someone to make him less lonely. After about two weeks of living together he started repeatedly asking if I had found any job listings and saying he found one that I would like. I had found a few places on my own too but honestly there wasn\u2019t anywhere for me that fit what I needed, good money, easy and chill, low hours, and close to my living space. And then another week went by, and he started bugging me about finding a place to live, claiming he found some great places, but honestly, I like living with him, it\u2019s nice and he has a great house. I was trying to hint to him that we could just live together, but he wasn\u2019t getting it. He started calling me a little kid because I \u201cwasn\u2019t doing anything ever and just wasting the little money [I] had.\u201d He was getting annoying, I was just trying to make more friends, so I was going to parties and bars, hanging out with people. When I finally got the courage to ask him about living together, he got all defensive and asked about if this was the plan all along, take advantage of him for a living space that I don\u2019t even pay for. I said I could, but he didn\u2019t believe me, he claimed that it was too expensive for someone living on $10 an hour and not rushing to get a job, he complained about how he was just taking care of me. I got annoyed and asked why he decided to be so mean about this and just said I couldn\u2019t live with him. I brought up that he said he enjoyed it and that he \u201clove[s]\u201d having someone to live with, I couldn\u2019t understand how he was mad. For the last week we have been ignoring each other sometimes he would tell me to \u201cfind a job for god\u2019s sake!\u201d he has become so mean, I don\u2019t know what to do. AITA?",

        "selftext": "I have a group of lady friends who plan regular get togethers. Most of us are connected through Carla (not her real name) who is our unofficial matriarch. She plans the events, they are usually at her house and when we do trips out of town, she pays for the Airbnb on her card and we pay her our portion. The most recent upcoming trip has an indoor pool. We go do these parties and pretty much let loose. There\u2019s drinking, and shenanigans. We\u2019re silly af.  To be clear we\u2019re old ladies. Most of us are moms and about half of us are grandmas. Carla asked how the group would feel if her grandbabies came for a swim in the morning. We established some guidelines- like not just Carla\u2019s grandkids could be invited, but only toddlers can come for the swim and they had to be brought by a female (or female presenting- this is a ladies weekend after all). There would be a strict time frame and we didn\u2019t plan on curtailing our behavior- so fair warning I guess. The group was divided, some feeling like they would feel stifled and it would change the whole vibe, others feeling like a morning time would not interfere with the craziness and it would be fun. I suggested that we do a vote, majority rules.  Here\u2019s where I might be the ahole. When the verdict was in, one person, we\u2019ll call her Jen, said she was out.

        "selftext": "We (both 26nb) met in 2021, they started dating my then flatmate. We became friends, tho not super close. A year later I moved countries and the three of us lost touch, just the occasional chat and Instagram comment. They broke up last year and me and my friend started talking more. I am in a bit of a rough situation. This move was not a smart decision - it's a tiny town (I'm a city person), with very few opportunities; going out, making friends, getting food, etc. The foreign language doesn't help. I am now conversational, but not fluent, which made jobs hard. I have a job, but it sucks and is only 30h. Due to that and some other things, I am in debt (~9000 USD). I want to move to bigger city with my bf (the only good thing in my life right now) but that obviously costs money. So I'm super depressed and stressed out. My friend has a big trust fund (which I knew), but don't have access to yet because of age. However, there's apparently some workaround, and they wanted to pay off my debt and give me some extra for the move, I can quit my job, and recover from my burnout. I didn't ask about the workaround, that felt like looking a gift horse in the mouth. I am obviously ecstatic. This is HUGE and life changing. They even want to give me money to open my own business. But this offer was made months ago and something always comes up. It's constantly 'will have it sorted by Tuesday!' or whatever. I have no right to this money but obviously I'm kinda banking on it and I hate that I'm now becoming the bad guy for asking updates As for the title. This friend thinks they can save the world singlehandedly, is always coming up with new ideas to save Luigi, to set up research labs, to collaborate with some royal family in Asia - ofc never happens. They also think they can firebend (yes, really), which has some 'scientific' explanation that they 'researched'. They also cross boundaries constantly, have a new best friend every week (whom they just met and offered money to) who is amaaaaazing and just 'gets' them, and they're addicted to ket (not suprising. When i confronted them, they got defensive and said addiction isn't real). I'm now realising they're quite toxic, and very good at using therapy speech to justify their behaviour; but acknowledging bad behaviour doesn't matter if nothing changes. I don't think this friendship is sustainable, but I'm not in a position to let go of the promise of money. What was meant to be a blessing is turning out to be a burden. My mental health even worse. I already set up a GoFundMe for them to send money to (tax reasons, apparently) but NOTHING happens. I don't wanna leave them, I genuinely care for them, but I just don't know what to do. WIBTA if I took the money and ran? Tldr; friend offered huge amount of money to help with debt & mental health, but nothing is happening and getting frustrated. Found out they are probably delusional and addicted. Don't know if I can keep this friendship but need the money.",

        "selftext": "A few days ago, I (21M) asked my friend (21F) if she wanted to hang out this weekend because I feel like she\u2019s become distant recently. She hasn\u2019t been willing to meet up with me so I was worried and was eager to meet up again. I messaged her a few days ago asking if she wanted to hang out next weekend. She lives in the next town. I have an appointment at 5:20 PM on Saturday, but I didn\u2019t mention this to her at first. I messaged her a few times asking if she wanted to hang out because she was taking a while to reply or else saying \u2018not sure\u2019. For context, she used to always get annoyed if I would \u201cstring her along\u201d with stuff or if I said \u201cI\u2019ll get back to you\u201d so me messaging her multiple times is just the same as what she did with me.  Eventually, she said that she and another friend were doing something Saturday evening and that I \u201ccould come along\u201d. I then mentioned my appointment, and she said, \u2018Why were you asking to hang out if you\u2019re not available?\u2019 I responded, \u2018I never said specifically Saturday evening\u2014it could\u2019ve been Saturday morning or Sunday.\u2019 She got annoyed with me telling me to mention it next time because saying the weekend gives the impression anytime Saturday or Sunday. Am I the asshole for asking her to hang out in the first place when I knew my availability wasn\u2019t great? I really wanted to meet up with her over the weekend but just Saturday evening, I wasn\u2019t available. Friday evening, Saturday (first half of day) and all of Sunday would\u2019ve worked. I believe she\u2019s free the rest of the weekend, she\u2019s not working or anything at the moment. Probably just asked me to come saturday because she was already meeting with her other friend then anyway. I kinda feel like an idiot though for not saying it at the time. We\u2019ve been becoming very distant lately and I feel I\u2019ve really screwed things up with this episode.",

        "selftext": "WIBTA for giving my dad the wrong name? So here\u2019s my situation. My (31M) Dad (50\u2019s M) lives on the other side of the country from me and my sister (27). He\u2019s a very old school conservative type guy and it\u2019s affected our relationship over the years due to him constantly brining up politics knowing we  disagree. I won\u2019t get too into it, our relationship needs a whole post of its own.  Last summer we made a trip to see him so his side of the family could meet my niece  (2 and adorable) We can call her L for the sake of this story. L has always preferred women, to the point where she\u2019s usually very uncomfortable around new men. She looooves me now (Def favorite uncle) but getting to this point took a lot of hard work, patience, and stick on tattoos. I never took her uncomfort around men personally but my dad did.  He usually calls us to check in once a week but lately I\u2019ve noticed he refers to L as \u201cthe baby\u201d when we talk about her. I know him, and I know that man has just fully forgotten his granddaughters name. L however didn\u2019t forget his name. How do I know you ask? Because just the other day she was laying on the floor while I was babysitting and I mentioned my dad to my partner. Unprompted L said \u201cI remember Grandpa blank. He liked me. But I don\u2019t really like him\u201d I don\u2019t think this is a case of him getting old and losing his memory, because he can still bring up older memories and names of his friends he hasn\u2019t seen in decades.  My plan is next time he says \u201cthe baby\u201d I\u2019m gonna say \u201cThe baby? You mean\u2026\u201d and give him a name that is maybe 2 or 3 letters off Ls name, but rhymes. Think Hannah to Lanah kind of vibe. I\u2019ve already run that idea by my mom and step-dad and they both nearly spilt their drinks laughing. Would this make me the asshole?",

        "selftext": "I (22f) have an older brother (John-32m) who has been with his fianc\u00e9 (Jane-30f) for 4 years. They have a 4 month old. Jane found out she was pregnant at 5 and a half weeks and immediately called my mum to tell her. Mum was confused, but still very excited. Jane said she was going to tell John when he got back from his work trip. A few hours later, she called again, sobbing, saying she has \u2018insatiable cravings\u2019. Mum made a joke like \u2018isn\u2019t it a bit early for cravings?\u2019 and Jane went OFF on her. She started yelling about how this was \u2018her pregnancy\u2019 and no one else\u2019s. It was an odd reaction. she also apologised for her outburst by blaming it on hormones. When my brother returned from his trip, him and Jane left to stay at her mother\u2019s and we didn\u2019t see her until after the baby was born. John said this was because Jane was afraid of losing the pregnancy and wanted to be with her mum and we needed to respect boundaries. Whenever someone would ask about Jane or the baby, they would shut it down with vague answers like \u2018Every pregnancy is different\u2019 or \u2018She\u2019s carrying small, which isn\u2019t unusual\u2019. They barely shared anything about the pregnancy. No ultrasound pictures, no baby shower, and Jane didn\u2019t want anyone around during the delivery. I also discovered that every craving she listed, came from one article about pregnancy cravings (she even listed multiple items in the same order as the article). When the baby was born, we were finally allowed to see Jane and John (and baby of course). It was very bittersweet as we all wished we could have been there for Jane to help out, but Jane and John both reassured us that we did help out by staying away during the pregnancy. The weirdest part though, is how Jane describes the birth. She claims she had an epidural via IV drip into her HAND (edited bc I didn't elaborate--)\u2026 which is NOT how those are administered. When I asked clarifying questions (thinking she had gotten confused, which is understandable) she shut down and refused to answer, like how she would during the pregnancy. She said the baby had 'latching issues' because he was born with no umbilical cord stump. This can technically happen, but it\u2019s a rare and fatal medical condition that their baby does not have. The final straw was when she told us that the baby \u2018basically fell out of her\u2019 within an hour of being in labour, despite my brother telling us how hard the birth was (and even stating that was why they weren\u2019t going to try for any more kids). Mum is on the same side as me, and has been noting this inconsistencies and inaccuracies but doesn\u2019t know how to bring it up. And their reactions don\u2019t help. A few days ago, my brother text mum saying her doubt of Jane is disrespectful and they both want full apologies from the both of us for 'bullying' Jane about her pregnancy/labour. I haven't made any outright accusations about it, nor have I said any of this to Jane. I've only asked questions when she brings the birth/pregnancy up. AITA for having doubts?",

These porcelain dolls were around when I was a child and I had memories of getting in trouble for playing with them. They were absolutely beautiful. Well, when my mother died I (29F) decided to keep ONE doll, I know it wasn\u2019t left to me, but I felt like they meant more to me than they could to my niece. I contemplated giving it back to her when she was old enough to appreciate it. We\u2019re from Louisiana and hurricane Laura hit \u2026 when we evacuated. I took the doll with me because I knew it was sentimental and irreplaceable. My niece, however let all of the remaining five dolls get ruined in hurricane because she let them in the house when where got ruined. My twin sister (Jays mom) thanks that it\u2019s only fair that I give Jay the doll. I kept safe because after all it was left for her\u2026. My argument is that if I would have gave her the doll, it would have gotten ruined with the other ones because she didn\u2019t care enough about them to take them her with her. Fast-forward, we are now in 2025 and I have a daughter of my own. I 100 % believe if my mom would have known she was gonna have another granddaughter she would have left a doll to her. AITA? ",

He went off at me for ruining a good night and that I was being picky about paying the bill, completely missing my point.

        "selftext": "My Maid of Honor (29F) found out she's pregnant and due in August. I (29F) live a plane ride away from her. We've been friends for 15 years.  Today my MOH mentioned planning a baby shower in a group chat with me and our other friend, we can call him Ben (29M).  She asked Ben, who is local to her, How can I make sure you can attend the baby shower? He has a demanding job. I have a salary job and it's easy to get time off.  MOH shared she wanted to have her baby shower on a specific long weekend between my wedding (In April) and her due date. I said I'm so sorry, that's [other friend, let's call her Sue]'s wedding. MOH said woof, well I think that's the only weekend I can do it. Not only is it Sue's wedding but I was also planning on going to an event in the wedding's area with another friend, Daisy, who was planning to fly there for the event. I have no other plans the remaining weekends. I said I'd really hate to have to be an asshole and cancel on two people, I'd really appreciate if you did not put me in that position. Perhaps my wording was disrespectful there. My MOH shared that she did not understand why I have an issue cancelling on Daisy, but Sue's wedding she can understand. I explained that if it came down to it, I would cancel both of them for her baby shower, but it just sucks to be in this position.  She made several comments such as my baby shower doesn't revolve around your schedule and Yeah I get being upset about cancelling things, I have to cancel and change things for the next 18 years. I chose to ignore these comments as she has shared she is hormonal and wants people to go easy on her. I asked her to speak to her husband's family about their schedule and let me know to try to de-escalate. She said she didn't understand why I was getting upset at her and I didn't understand where she was coming from. Where she is coming from is that she is guessing this weekend is the only weekend her husband's family is available, and the weather around that time would likely be ideal. That's when I snapped a bit and pointed out that I was ignoring her rude comments and just wanted to work with her because I love her but she doesn't seem to see that effort and asked her to stop attacking me.  From there we did manage to de-escalate, but I still feel hurt that she was not willing to reconsider her plans for me, but had no problem asking Ben about how to make sure he can come. I also feel upset that she doesn't find it significant that I am being expected to cancel plans with multiple people that involve travel. Her opinion is I should have little problem cancelling these other things for her baby shower. I love her, I will, but it still fucking sucks. AITA for telling my MOH to stop attacking me after I told her it'd suck to cancel two large life plans for her baby shower. EDIT: This baby shower is NOT scheduled or confirmed with any of her family. She was throwing out a possible weekend and I shared I was busy. To clarify, if this date was SET and she told me \u201cthis is when it is, it is scheduled\u201d I would not have given her any grief at all.  EDIT2: some commenters have expressed opinion changes with this detail. We have the kind of friendship where I am 100% expected to attend this baby shower, which she considers a major life event. I am wondering if I am the asshole for not wanting to cancel on my other commitments or if she is the asshole for expecting me to cancel these and not being very willing to choose a date I am free, despite completely expecting my presence.  UPDATE: I spoke with my MOH today and we have resolved this conflict. We had a communication breakdown. She does expect me to be there but understands I have commitments. She chose another weekend.

        "selftext": "I have two children: Donna (21F) and Austin (19M). Both live at home but also stay on campus at their respective colleges. Austin has a girlfriend, Bridget, whom he\u2019s been dating for nearly a year. Early in their relationship, Bridget stayed over once while Donna was at school. With Donna\u2019s blessing, Bridget slept in Donna\u2019s room, and Austin stayed in his own. They chose to sleep separately, and there was no drama. This winter break, both kids were home. Toward the end of break, Bridget returned from out of state but couldn\u2019t move back into her dorm yet. Austin asked if she could stay with us for a few days. I agreed but mentioned we\u2019d need to figure out sleeping arrangements since we don\u2019t have a guest room\u2014just mine and my husband\u2019s room, Austin\u2019s, and Donna\u2019s. Austin said he and Bridget now share a bed, but his twin bed would be a tight fit. Donna has a full-sized bed, so I suggested Donna and Austin switch rooms temporarily. Donna could use Austin\u2019s bed, and Austin and Bridget would stay in hers. I assured Donna I\u2019d change the bedding afterward, but she was visibly upset and asked why Austin couldn\u2019t just sleep on the couch. I told her it was only for a few days, and since Austin wanted to share a bed with Bridget, this arrangement made sense. When Bridget arrived, everything seemed fine at first. That night, Bridget went to bed early, and Donna pulled Austin aside in the kitchen. I couldn\u2019t hear the start of their conversation, but Austin suddenly started yelling, \u201cShut up! Why would you say that?\u201d before storming into the living room. He loudly announced he\u2019d never invite Bridget back if \u201ceverything\u2019s such a problem.\u201d When I asked what happened, Austin explained that Donna asked him not to have sex with Bridget in her bed. He claimed he had no intention of doing that and accused Donna of being weird and trying to cause trouble. Donna said she had purposely tried to talk to Austin quietly to avoid a scene and hadn\u2019t said anything to Bridget. She also said it wasn\u2019t unreasonable to ask, given she knew Austin and Bridget were sexually active. I told Donna she didn\u2019t need to make such a big deal since I\u2019d already promised to wash the sheets. Donna became upset and ended up staying with a friend for the rest of break. School has since resumed, but Donna is barely responding to my calls or texts. Austin told me Bridget overheard the argument and now feels uncomfortable being in our house or around Donna. My husband said Austin caused the scene by yelling and pointed out that Donna wasn\u2019t out of line for making her request. He also said I should never have let Bridget stay in the first place.AITA? ",

        "selftext": "Son's birthday today. He's 5 years old. I wasnt there this morning as stay away from home some nights due to work. Even if had slept at home would have left for work before the kids woke. We have a party planned on Saturday, and will be there at dinner time tonight. I realised that my wife gave my son a present this morning. She said it was from 'us. Apparently she does this every year. I was hurt, and told her so. I thought it was selfish that she couldn't wait to share his excitement.  Her excuse is that it is unfair on him to make him wait. find that ridiculous, and believe he absolutely could wait.  I said the only reason to give it early is the selfishness of wanting to experience his joy alone without sharing it. AITA?  Edit(s): This blew up quicker than I expected (I couldn't get online for the last hour). And overwhelmingly with YTA responses, many with some unfair assumptions so I want to add some context in my defence although I think it wont change the general outcome. 1. Today is his birthday, although we have other special plans. Next week I'm taking 3 days off work, two of which are for a family trip and the third is a special day for my son. I couldn't get today off work though, and Saturday is his proper party, which I obviously will be there. I have a 1.5 hour commute each way (hence why I don't normally see him in the morning before he gets up for school), but I normally read the bedtime story when I'm home and I video call EVERY evening that I'm not home. I'm not an absentee father, and I'm not just a sperm donor. 2. My wife has bought most of the presents but not all of them. We tend to put things in gift bags not wrap them. Last year it was me that bought the main present, this year there wasn't a main present, it was mostly a few smaller ones because the family trips mentioned in (1) are really his main present. I don't expect her to do all the gift shopping and give all the ideas, I do a share of it. She does have more free time than me, and does more of the childcare than me. That's a problem of our (shared) lifechoices and not something that we can easily change. My long commute is primarily due to decisions on her part. 3. Yes, she said she does this every year, but first and second birthday are not quite the same level of concious response, and 3rd and 4th I am not sure what she gave him in the morning. As I mentioned, last year I got the 'main' present, and that was given in the evening I am definitely jealous if she is giving him presents. I definitely want to be part of the enjoyment of his birthday.  I was hurt and didn't understand why he had to receive the present when I wasn't there. Yep he's 5 years old, and every family is different. I don't remember receiving presents until the whole family was there in the evening. I thought that was normal, and assumed my wife had the same thoughts. We hadn't discussed it, and I was upset for missing out.I think if I knew, then I wouldn't have reacted that way, but it was a shock and I was upset. I still am jealous and have some feelings to work through. I don't like my work situation and commute, but I really don't see a way to resolve it (without significant financial risk that I'm not willing to take in this climate) so will have to suck up my disappointment. I called my wife selfish for getting the joy, alone without discussing it first, or without giving me the chance to join on video call. I guess I need to take the YTA verdict. Edit(again):Too many comments to respond to, and can't respond for at least a few hours so that I can spend time with my son on his birthday!",

        "selftext": "I (35F) and my husband (33M) live together with our two children (3M & 1F).  Recently I have been under the weather with some low level cold & sore throat. I\u2019m feeling crappy but still able to do day to day stuff, I have been going to work, looking after the children etc as normal.  Today the children are due to be looked after by our childminders who live next door to us, we can drop them off anywhere between 8-9am. We get them up and dressed and feed them breakfast before they go and pack their bags with spare clothes, nappies, bottles for our daughter and food for both of them throughout the day.  Today I have a dentist appointment in the town over at 10am. My husband is due to attend a viewing of a primary school in the village next to us in the opposite direction at 9:20am with my mother who is making her own way there.  This morning I got up when my alarm went off with my son, got him dressed and gave him his breakfast, went back upstairs for our daughter, got her dressed and gave her her bottle then started making their lunches which included washing up as there were no clean bottles for her to take with her. My husband remained in bed until 8:50am then came downstairs and asked why I was stressed and grumpy. I told him that I\u2019d got up by myself with both children, needed to leave for my appointment in ten minutes and the kids bags still weren\u2019t packed and the car was frozen and I still wasn\u2019t dressed myself. He then asked what he could do to help and I asked him to defrost the car which he did.  When we had dropped the kids off at 9am I started getting myself dressed and he asked I was \u2018even going to have time\u2019 to take him to the primary school (we only have one car and only I have a drivers licence), I said no and was he expecting me to take him and he said yes because I had organised the trip to the primary school.  I pointed out that while I have organised for him to go to the primary school I am not actually going myself. Not only that I have plans, which he knows about, at the same time in a different location in the opposite direction. Also at no point has he asked me for a lift. He says I should have known he would be expecting a lift there as I planned the visit.  In addition to the above, if I was going to give him a lift we would have needed to leave earlier so I could drop him off and make my appoint on time but he didn\u2019t get up with me and get the children out of the house and everything ready so we could do this.  I left for my dentist appointment while he complained he was going to be late and started trying to book a taxi at around 9:10am.  So AITA for not giving my husband a lift to the school viewing?  For info - at 9:05 once we realised he was expecting a lift and I wasn\u2019t expecting to give him one if we had left immediately to drop him off I would probably have been about 5 minutes late to my appointment, maybe just made it if traffic was ok but the ground is frosty today so driving conditions weren\u2019t great.  For info #2 - also, for everyone in the comments who is at an absolute loss for how he was supposed to get himself there without a lift, The school is a ten minute drive from our house and taxis are very cheap where we live, it would have cost him approximately \u00a35 to get a cab there.  Update - ok ok I get it, I\u2019m TA for going to the dentist with a cold haha. Although yes I do take on board all the comments highlighting our issues with communication, going forward we\u2019re going to have a briefing for the next day where we\u2019re clear about who is getting up in the morning, what our plans are and how we\u2019re getting there. Also for those dragging my husband for being a third child, despite how he was acting yesterday he\u2019s usually a very involved partner and father who takes on many jobs around the household and does his fair share of parenting. He used to get up in the night with our daughter and I would do the early mornings which worked well for us however our daughter no longer really wakes up in the night and he has continues to have the lie ins so I think we just need to update our division of labour in that regard. Thanks to everyone who\u2019s posted measured and detailed responses, I\u2019ve found a lot of helpful advice. ",

        "selftext": "Hi AITA, I have a 5 year old cardigan corgi. He\u2019s an absolute unit, and as my friends say, he\u2019s high in strength/constitution and low in intelligence/wisdom. He often tries to eat things that aren\u2019t safe for him.  I live alone and hired a dog walker I found on Rover to visit him once a day during the work week. Instead of going through the app, I agreed to pay her in cash. She\u2019s generally been great. But, we\u2019ve had a few mishaps like her not telling me when my dog ate and tore up a wooden hand fan. I\u2019ve given her the benefit of the doubt because my dog loves her and enjoys his walks with her.  Last night, my dog vomited up five or so partially chewed, large, bright-orange seeds. They are from the coontie plant and are in the same family as sago palms, which can be fatally toxic to dogs even in small amounts. Unfortunately, they are part of the landscape in my \u201cdog-friendly\u201d apartment complex.  I decided not to wait it out and took my dog to the emergency vet. They admitted him to critical care because the risk of him deteriorating was so high, even though he was in good spirits when I left him.  I messaged my dog walker to let her know what happened, and she insists she never saw him eat the seeds and that she tries to prevent him from eating things on the ground. I know he did not eat the seeds on my watch, because I exclusively took him to the turf-only dog park yesterday, which isn\u2019t near the toxic plants.  This emergency vet visit is costing thousands of dollars. I haven\u2019t brought up the cost to her yet, but WIBTA to request that she contributes to this huge expense? I get it\u2019s my dog, but also I have never let this happen on my watch. I understand it was likely an honest mistake, but also I feel as though it\u2019s really irresponsible to let someone\u2019s dog eat random things off the ground, especially if you aren\u2019t paying close attention.  Edit \u2014 Thanks everyone for your feedback. I will absolutely accept that I would be TA if I asked my walker to contribute to my vet bills. I had several people in my life reach out and suggest I ask, hence this post.  I will not be asking her to pay. I will, however, invest in good pet insurance and will only pay dog walkers through Rover from now on.  I will clarify a few things for the sake of this post. - Yes, I pointed out the unsafe area. - Yes, she knows he will eat things off the ground, but she also knows he is trained and responsive to several commands including \u201cleave it\u201d, \u201cdrop it\u201d, and \u201cwait\u201d.  - This plant is only in specific parts of the complex, which are easily avoidable. - Yes, multiple sources have confirmed this was a life-threatening situation for my dog due to what was ingested.  Edit Part 2: Electric Boogaloo \u2014 Thank you AGAIN for everyone\u2019s feedback. My Hoover of a dog is doing okay, his labs look good and hopefully he\u2019s coming home soon.  A few more things I\u2019ll add: - I will absolutely be investing in a muzzle.- like some of you have suggested, it might be worthwhile to invest in a more vetted walker (instead of Rover)- I am very blessed, and my low rider Unit of a dog\u2019s bills are paid (yes, by some of the very people who asked whether I was going to ask my current walker for compensation)- I walked my apartment complex\u2019s property this morning. On the very far side of my building, there is a line of these palms that were apparently just trimmed, and there are huge piles of the seeds all lined up. Dog walker admitted to letting my Dyson Dog \u201csniff\u201d the seeds, so \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f- it\u2019s a moot point because there are lots of things I will do moving forward to prevent this from happening again (boy I\u2019m dense, I genuinely don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t think of a muzzle in the first place \u2014 I\u2019ve used things like grazing muzzles for my horses before). - Medical scares and renewed agency are one hell of a drug. - I do want to say, I\u2019ve truly been trying my best. I came here for feedback, and I got what I needed to move forward and keep my dumb dog safe. Reddit gives me tough love, and even when it stings, I\u2019m grateful. - I talked to the front office staff about the plants. If anything, maybe some signs can be posted. ",

        "selftext": "I (35M) have a friend, Steve (48), who accidentally got Stephanie (44) pregnant about a decade ago, and they now have a daughter, Chloe (9). I met Steve last year at a park while walking my dog, and we became friends since he lives nearby and also has a dog. Steve\u2019s a good guy who cares deeply about his daughters (he has three adult daughters from another relationship). Whenever I\u2019m with Steve and Stephanie calls, she often seems ridiculous. Sometimes she calls over minor things; other times, she\u2019s frantic, like she\u2019s on the verge of a breakdown. She\u2019s a helicopter parent and very possessive of Chloe. Stephanie doesn\u2019t let Chloe visit Steve alone. The first time Steve ever took Chloe anywhere without her was recently\u2014and only because one of his adult daughters went with them to a movie. Steve said Stephanie blew up Chloe's phone the entire time. Steve wanted to teach Chloe to ski, but Stephanie told him it wasn\u2019t appropriate for a 9-year-old and that he needed to find a better activity. Every idea Steve has for activities gets shut down with an excuse. Despite this, Stephanie often makes passive-aggressive comments like, \u201cCome over here and be a dad,\u201d even though Steve gives her at least $250 a month (voluntarily, no court order) and spends multiple evenings a week at her place to be with Chloe as that's Stephanie's idea of visitation. She makes it seem like he isn't a good father or something when it is\u00a0**she**\u00a0that doesn't really let Chloe hang out with friends,\u00a0**she**\u00a0that bought Chloe a smartphone due to her incessant need to always be able to contact her,\u00a0**she**\u00a0who isolates Chloe from Steve's side of the family and\u00a0**she**\u00a0who is always worrying about making rent, yet only has a part-time job and spends money that should be going towards other things on weed. When Steve brought up to Stephanie that he thought that 9 is way too young to have a smartphone, his concerns were all ignored. When he brought up that he doesn't like Chloe being around her when she is smoking weed due to secondhand smoke, the issue was disregarded. Recently, Stephanie moved, and I helped Steve while she mostly stood around watching. Her place looked like it was recently featured on *Hoarders*. That day, Stephanie took Chloe to the ER for **the flu** as Urgentcare won't see her without insurance. Later, I told Steve about the Affordable Care Act and how he could get insurance for himself and Chloe. The next day, Steve asked Stephanie for Chloe\u2019s social security number to enroll her, and Stephanie freaked out, saying, I don't even give Chloe's SSN to the state! She claimed Chloe was already insured and when asked by Steve who the insurer was, she mumbled something vague. I directly asked, \u201cWho is she insured through then?\u201d and Stephanie snapped, yelling, \u201cWE ARE HER PARENTS!\u201d When we left, Steve said, \u201cSee what I\u2019m dealing with? How she snapped at you?\u201d I replied that she had a point\u2014it\u2019s not really my business. What do you think? Was I an asshole for asking who insures her child? EDIT: I wanted to add that I have already advised him to get an attorney. He mentioned once that his brother is in huge debt over attorney fees to get time with his own daughter. I let him know that many attorneys will work with you and let you pay in monthly installments and he was very receptive. I was going to include that in the original post but was limited to 3000 characters. Why he hasn't done this already? I don't know, I mean I certainly would have long ago. Also that about $250 is in addition to him paying a big portion of her rent every month. SECOND EDIT: Wanted to add that I agree that my buddy should have taken care of this sooner. He stopped smoking weed shortly after I met him and has gotten and new job and is getting his life together, but Stephanie has made not made it easy for him to be a good dad by alienating Chloe from him and his side of the family. Her need for control is so great that she won't allow Steve to spend time with the child alone, and she wouldn't give the SSN to Steve because she perceives it as getting one over on her. When Steve asked her for the SSN so he could insure Chloe at **no cost to her** she should be happy to oblige, not adversarial. She isn't working at co-parenting and **he clearly is.** As far as child support what more should he be doing? He already pays a big portion of the rent and whenever she calls him for money, he never says no or doesn't give her money when she asks so I'm not sure what more he should be doing. ",

        "selftext": "My mother in law (wife\u2019s mom) initiated a divorce from her 2nd husband late in 2022. NC law requires couples to live separately for a year before divorce proceedings can occur. She asked to move into our house, which gave her our bonus room. This room is a 12x24 room, with carpet, a closet, full bathroom for herself attached to the room. She moved into our house on 12/31/22 and began paying rent ($500 per month for the first year, then she volunteered an extra $100 per month for the 2nd year to cover Netflix access and increases in HOA dues and utilities). She just moved out last month into her new home.  My wife and I knew we needed our flooring downstairs replaced, and we wanted to go ahead and do our stairs, main hallway, primary bedroom. The bonus room we had decided to also get done, since the carpet had been lived on 24/7 for 2 years. My mother in law worked from home so she essentially spent her time in that room working, relaxing, or sleeping. She also had a dog with her.  We felt it wasn\u2019t right to charge her the cost of the upgraded flooring we wanted, so we asked the flooring estimator to send us a separate price for similar carpet in the bonus room so that we could present that price to her. We were told the LVP option was $2500, the carpet option was $1400. We advised her of the $1400 in November, and told her it wasn\u2019t expected up front, nor would we ask for it after she closed on her new home. We were willing to work with her on it. Flash forward a month and she\u2019s moved out, and she asks to speak with us about the carpet payment. She isn\u2019t sure why she\u2019s being asked to pay $1400 when she thought it was our plan all along to change the flooring anyways. Mind you, this carpet was new and used as a toddler playroom for about an hour each day prior to her arrival. She and I decided to agree to reduce it to $500 because she felt she should have been able to at least get the carpets cleaned, which would have cost $500. We denied this request initially because we knew that carpet cleaning wasn\u2019t going to remove the wear and tear of her existence. Well, once we agree on $500, she asks about the $100 I had agreed to refund her for some car work I had done. I agreed to it and figured we were done.  Next, my wife finds out about this agreement and immediately calls her mom to discuss in frustration. Her mom decides to \u201coblige\u201d to $1400 but then begins to say how she incurred extra costs from her car repairs because I wasn\u2019t able to fix her car, and that it should cover her $1400. She also mentioned that her extra $100 per month should have covered the cost as well, even though that was never agreed upon.  Of course, since this all happened right before the holidays, we just agreed to accept $400. We\u2019ve seen eachother a few times without issue, but there\u2019s still some bitterness, especially with the comments about how she now had to pay a bigger sum of money for her car repairs.

Last November she decided she wanted to go on a trip for her birthday. Conveniently it was \u201cfor our birthdays even though I went in support to what she wanted to do and we traveled all day on my birthday.

        "selftext": "My (29F) daughter is five months old and goes to a daycare at my husband\u2019s (32M) workplace. My mother in law also works at the same place so she has easy access to the daycare. At least once a week she goes and spends 30 minutes to an hour just playing with my daughter. This rubs me the wrong way for so many reasons. As a mom, it frustrates me that she thinks it\u2019s okay to just drop by whenever without at least saying something or asking (I actually just found out while writing this that she tells my husband but nobody communicates it with me). As a former daycare worker, I would have hated having someone just come in and spend time with a child because now not only do they have infants to watch, but now they have to work around a fully grown woman and make sure that she isn\u2019t taking pictures/videos of other babies as well. I think my biggest issue is honestly that some days she gets to spend more awake time with my daughter than I do and I know that\u2019s a horrible reason to be frustrated with someone but it is what it is. Would I be the asshole if I asked her to stop visiting daycare so frequently? She comes to our house and gets to spend several hours with my daughter at least once a week so it\u2019s not like daycare is the only time she gets to see her.   ETA: Yes. I know I\u2019m the asshole for being jealous. After talking with my husband, I\u2019m realizing a lot of these feelings are based on big emotions from being exhausted and PPD. I don\u2019t hate my mother in law. This is my first and probably only child and she\u2019s my rainbow baby so I\u2019m very protective. For those of you that politely told me I\u2019m the asshole, thank you. For those of you that told me I need to see a therapist, already seeing one for my chronic depression and added postpartum depression so I\u2019m good. I\u2019m going to stop reading comments now and go snuggle with my baby that just got home. ",

        "selftext": "I (27F) have a strange living situation. I live with a family (Chris, 65M, Danielle, 59F, and their daughter) and do household chores in exchange for rent. I've lived here for 19 months; it's mostly smooth sailing. I work full-time and am applying to law school. Danielle has some issues with boundaries (she doesn't understand why she can\u2019t enter my room w/o permission, for example), and I know it's both due to age differences and the fact that they allow me to live in their house for free. I have to be very careful when enforcing boundaries. Yesterday, I made dinner for everyone after a full day of chores. Around 10 pm, as I was finishing the dishes, Danielle told me I needed to steam clean the carpet in the living room because the cats had peed all over it. I did, and as I was putting the steam cleaner away, Danielle entered and said she wanted me to do another room. Because it was 10:30 at this point and I still wanted to work on an application before bed, I politely but firmly said, I'm not going to do that. I probably should have said, I'll do it tomorrow, but I was exhausted, so I just said no. I put the machine away, submitted my application, and went to bed. Tonight, as I was finishing up my meal prep for the week, Danielle cornered me in the kitchen. I don't want to fight about this, she said, But I wanted to mention something. Last night when you told me you weren't going to clean the other room, I found it rude. You should be careful when you say things like that at work so that you don't get fired. I was floored. I snapped, Danielle, you haven't had a job since before I was born. You don't get to give me advice about how to act in the workplace. Danielle rolled her eyes and huffed, See, I didn't want to fight about this, and walked out of the room. I called after her, Then maybe don't bring it up?!? Danielle hasn't spoken to me since, and I don't know what's coming. For context, Danielle has only had one job in her whole life, from age 22 to age 25. After that, she quit to raise kids. I grew up very poor. I have been working since I was 14 and supporting myself since I turned 18. They offered to start our arrangement in 2023 because they needed help around the house and I was struggling financially. As for Danielle's work advice, I currently work as a Regional Manager at a small firm. Not only is her advice outdated, but I can't take it. I'm a people manager; a lot of my day-to-day job involves being polite but unyielding. I think she was frustrated by my setting a boundary and that's why she brought it up. I know part of my frustration is that I feel powerless to protest most of the time. I will be moving out in August of this year when I go to law school (hopefully!), and my goal is just to make it until then. I'm also really frustrated that Danielle felt like she could say whatever she wanted and then walk away as if I had no right to feel anything. AITA for what I said? UPDATE: First, as an aside, a lot of the comments here missed the point. Danielle was not angry with me for refusing to do an additional chore at 10:30pm; that was not the issue. Even by the most generous of understandings, demanding additional overtime work at the end of a 14-hour shift is unreasonable, and she knew that. During our follow-up discussion, she added a detail I had totally forgotten about \u2013 the second room in question has a large potted Fiddle-Leaf Fig tree in it, and in order to steam clean the additional room, the tree needs to be moved. Neither she or I were able to move it after multiple attempts, so at that point I said, \u201cUntil Chris and I can figure out a way to move this, the steam cleaning will have to wait. I know you want it done tonight, but I will not be doing that.\u201d Very important context that I missed adding when I was angry. The issue in question was the exchange the next day. As to how I responded the second day when she came to confront me on my wording, for that, I understand now that I was absolutely the asshole. As one of my close friends put it to me, \u201cThose are inside thoughts.\u201d My context about her work history was also unnecessary and irrelevant. Last night, I approached Danielle and opened the conversation with a profuse apology. No qualifiers, no protests, just that I was rude during our kitchen conversation and I needed to apologize. She in turn immediately apologized for her incredibly poor introduction to the follow-up conversation and for cornering me in the kitchen while I was otherwise occupied instead of meeting with me at a more neutral time. Chris then joined us and we had an extensive conversation. During the conversation, I asked them to define how they view our arrangement. They were immediately very clear that they don\u2019t see me as a tenant, employee, or servant. I pointed out that if that is how they want to view things, then I need to be free to say no extra requests. They were receptive to this. I also pointed out that in our state, I could either be considered a tenant or a live-in domestic worker, but due to the length of time I\u2019ve resided here and the conditions in place, I am definitely not considered just a guest. They did get offended that I see our relationship as fundamentally a transaction, which I found kind of funny, because while they have the freedom to frame it in their minds as \u201cwe\u2019re helping this person out and she\u2019s helping us out,\u201d it\u2019s wise for me to see it differently. I do have obligations to them and my life has substantially larger implications should this not work out. In the end, they agreed that because they aren\u2019t landlords and I am not their employee (in their minds), I should be receiving more freedom than I have been given. Chris and Danielle have chronic illnesses that make most of the work I do very difficult for them, including a lot of the care I provide for their adult daughter who lives with us. We then outlined (again) exactly what my responsibilities are and what they\u2019re not. Finally, to my surprise, they apologized for previous invasions of privacy and agreed that we would put a lock on my room door. It is an interior lock only so I can\u2019t lock it while I\u2019m gone, but I am fine with the progress. I was never threatened with eviction or anything like that; people can be emotionally mature enough to talk through issues instead of immediately pulling a metaphorical trigger, which is what happened here. After the conversation, I typed out a long email detailing the terms of my living here as it currently stands and had them send a confirmation in reply. While it is not officially a lease, it is something in writing outlining responsibilities that was agreed to by all parties. We agreed that my monthly hours would be reduced to 80 instead of the roughly 100 I have been doing. If the value of that is calculated according to the federal minimum wage, that\u2019s a value of $580 every four weeks, which is more than most rooms-for-rent are in our area. Of course, the labor I do is somewhat skilled and has a market value of at least double, but I used the federal minimum wage for the sake of argument. I also established that the latest I would be available for housework is 9:30pm, barring some form of emergency, and if a task absolutely requires going past that time, I will be taking that time back on a different day. I know that I will laugh at this in Contracts class in the future, but for now, I\u2019m fine with what it is. Like I said in a comment, it\u2019s not ideal but it works. I\u2019m not in a position where I desperately need this anymore, but I\u2019m going to stay here until August because being able to funnel what otherwise would be paid in rent into savings is doing wonders to set me up for the future. To everyone that commented something along the lines of \u201cYou have to do everything she says\u201d or \u201cYou\u2019re the help\u201d or \u201cYou\u2019re entitled,\u201d I encourage you to think about that perspective more. Employees, household help, and any people in a subordinate position are still very much an individual and deserving of basic respect to their space, their time, and their person. No laws, no matter how extensive, take those basic rights away. Also, if you said it was my \u201cfault\u201d for being in the situation in the first place, kick rocks. We are all working through our own situations where we pick the best option available even if it isn\u2019t perfect. That\u2019s not weakness or stupidity, that\u2019s life.",

        "selftext": "I\u2019m a single dad to a 15 year old girl. We live in an area where we get a lot of snow every winter. Around the time she was 11, I taught her how to shovel and usually, we do it together. We have a decent sized driveway and walkway. Sometimes, if it\u2019s too icy, I\u2019ll do the whole thing myself. Over the weekend, we got some unexpected snow while I was at work. I called my daughter and asked that she shovel out a bit of the driveway so I\u2019ll have room to park and get out the next day, as well as shovel the walkway and steps. She said yes. When I came home, the entire driveway was shoveled and the walkway and steps were cleared perfectly. I thanked her and said she did a good job. She then told me that when she went out to shovel, she saw our neighbor (who\u2019s a couple years older than her) was shoveling his walkway. She offered him $40 of her own money to shovel for her and he accepted.  I told her that I had asked her to shovel, not the neighbor and it was something assigned to her. She asked what the big deal was, as it got done. She also pointed out when she has her own house some day, she can easily just pay someone to do it so she doesn\u2019t have to do it. I told her she wasn\u2019t in trouble but next time it snowed, she was helping me shovel and going forward if I asked her to do it, she was expected to do it. She seemed a little disappointed but didn\u2019t argue. I was talking to my mom about the situation and she told me I completely overreacted, and pointed out my daughter has a point. The job got done and it shouldn\u2019t matter how it gets done, as long as it does, and the neighbor kid willingly did it (which I confirmed with him later that he was happy to do it for the extra cash). My mom said I should\u2019ve praised my daughter\u2019s initiative.  So, now I\u2019m left wondering if I was the asshole for lecturing my daughter on this.  Edit: To those asking, she got the money from babysitting. She works for a different neighbor twice a week and is paid $18/hr. We\u2019ve had talks about money constantly over the years, ever since she was old enough to receive birthday and Christmas money and decide how to spend it. She knows the value of the dollar, that once you spend money it\u2019s gone, and to think before you buy. She says to her, this was worth the $40.  And to those asking why it bugged me, I thank you because I wasn\u2019t even sure myself. I think I just want to make sure that she has these skills, but I also understand people\u2019s points that she has the skill and she can now decide to use it if she\u2019s in a situation like this one.  **Update*** I want to thank everyone who talked some sense into me. You all were right, it really doesn\u2019t matter how it gets done. As well as the fact that yes, there are times I contract out work of my own, so it\u2019s unfair to expect otherwise of her. One of my main priorities is that she\u2019s able to do things on her own. I won\u2019t always be around to help and I want her to be independent. But, I realize now, this was her being independent and getting something done, just in a different way. I spoke with her and apologized for lecturing her. I also added I was proud of her for taking initiative and explained why I reacted the way I did. Additionally, I thanked her for getting it done, regardless of how it was. She forgave me and everything is good now. We did have another talk about money but she insists that\u2019s how she wanted to spend it, so I\u2019m going to leave it alone for now. But she says she appreciates me admitting I was wrong. I told her next time, she can either hire the neighbor again or do it herself, I don\u2019t care as long as it\u2019s what they both want.  Some people said I should force her to put more into savings. She already puts a good amount away on her own. I\u2019m going to continue to let her decide what works for her.  Also, to those going to either extreme that either 1) I was wrong for having her shovel because she\u2019s a girl or 2) assuming I\u2019m only making her do chores and expecting her to do them herself because she\u2019s a girl, you\u2019re wrong. I do everything that I ask her to do, and I also occasionally contract out tasks. I don\u2019t care if she does in the future. This was a genuine mistake on my part and not anything malicious where I expect more/less of my daughter because she\u2019s a girl. ",

        "selftext": "So, a little context: I (35M) am getting married to my fianc\u00e9, Audrey (29F), in a few months. My brother, Steve (30M), has been dating his girlfriend, Lisa (28F), for about a year now. I\u2019ve never really clicked with Lisa, but we\u2019ve always been cordial. She\u2019s kind of loud and opinionated. She also has a tendency to interrupt people when they\u2019re talking, and it drives me nuts. Here\u2019s where it gets tricky. A few weeks ago, my mom mentioned that I \u201creally should\u201d invite Lisa to the wedding, even though I didn\u2019t initially plan to. I told my mom that I was keeping the guest list tight, and that it was more about the vibe of the event. I didn\u2019t think it would be an issue since Lisa and I aren\u2019t close. But my mom started pushing, saying that if I didn\u2019t invite Lisa, it would be \u201csuper awkward\u201d for Steve and that \u201cfamily is important.\u201d I still didn\u2019t budge, and my mom seemed to accept it. However, I was talking to Steve yesterday, and he brought up the wedding. He casually mentioned that Lisa was upset she wasn\u2019t invited, and that it was \u201cweird\u201d that she was left out when she\u2019s been dating him for a year. He said that it would mean a lot to him if I reconsidered. I told him I didn\u2019t want to cause drama, but I just didn\u2019t feel comfortable inviting someone I don\u2019t get along with to my wedding. He got kind of quiet and then said, \u201cI guess I\u2019ll just skip the wedding, then,\u201d and walked off. Now, I\u2019m feeling conflicted. I don\u2019t want to lose my brother over this, but I also don\u2019t think it\u2019s my responsibility to make space for someone who isn\u2019t really part of my life, especially on such a personal day.",

        "selftext": "My 18yo daughter lives at home - as she should since she is not at college or working in a full time job. She graduated high school in 2024 and has a part time job.  She does not drive. My husband and I drive her to work, to her community activities, to hang out with friends, and to dates. She recently asked if she could have 5 people over for her birthday and for a sleepover. We said no. We told our kids that parties are fine through their 18th birthday and for graduation but after that we only have family celebrations. Our reasons: It's a small place and we'd be on top of each other.  After working our jobs all week and juggling her and her brother's activities, we need some calm and quiet. Also, we don't know these kids.  Having them over for a couple of hours is something I can gear myself up for, but an open-ended time of strangers in my space... my heart is racing as I'm typing this.  It makes me super anxious. Daughter knows this (about the anxiety) but has been arguing that it's not a big deal, everyone else does it, and I never have people over.  She has had people over from time to time, but since she and her friends are all dependent on rides, it doesn't happen often. I floated the idea of a 2-3 hour hangout but since she argued with us for about 20 minutes, my husband is like 'nope. not gonna happen. I understand that she's disappointed and wants to hang out with her friends for her birthday. So, reddit, would I be the asshole for not hosting a party for my daughter's 19th birthday? UPDATE 9:55 pm. Some thought provoking questions in the comments. No sleepovers ever? Yes, from around 2nd grade to age 16 we hosted a couple every year - except during Covid, of course.  She hasn't been interested for a few years.  Why doesn't she drive? Lost her driver's license after causing 2 accidents in 3 months.  Thankfully, only damage from the accidents was to the cars; all people involved were fine. However, insurance dropped her and threatened to drop us if she didn't surrender her license. How are you  trying to help her? I've been trying to get her to try for her driver's license again but I'm meeting with resistance.  Talked about the pros and cons of several career opportunities but she doesn't want to have anything to do with it.  Going to counseling, but she seems to use it as a vent session - which can be helpful! - rather than taking the homework and following through with the counselor's advice. Honestly, I know that I need to step up here and take the lead.  Humans tend to do a much or as little as is expected of them; I need to help her raise her expectations. Why isn't she in college? She's not interested in post secondary education right now. She may go back later, and I'm fine with that.  Why doesn't she have a full time job? She doesn't know what she wants to do.  She's currently refusing to look for a full time and I'm not willing to kick her out.  I know a lot of folks do that to their kid when they become an adult, but I don't want to.  I love her and like having her around, knowing she's safe.  Honestly, as a parent I am struggling with how to help her without pushing her away.  ",

        "selftext": "I have a group of lady friends who plan regular get togethers. Most of us are connected through Carla (not her real name) who is our unofficial matriarch. She plans the events, they are usually at her house and when we do trips out of town, she pays for the Airbnb on her card and we pay her our portion. The most recent upcoming trip has an indoor pool. We go do these parties and pretty much let loose. There\u2019s drinking, and shenanigans. We\u2019re silly af.  To be clear we\u2019re old ladies. Most of us are moms and about half of us are grandmas. Carla asked how the group would feel if her grandbabies came for a swim in the morning. We established some guidelines- like not just Carla\u2019s grandkids could be invited, but only toddlers can come for the swim and they had to be brought by a female (or female presenting- this is a ladies weekend after all). There would be a strict time frame and we didn\u2019t plan on curtailing our behavior- so fair warning I guess. The group was divided, some feeling like they would feel stifled and it would change the whole vibe, others feeling like a morning time would not interfere with the craziness and it would be fun. I suggested that we do a vote, majority rules.  Here\u2019s where I might be the ahole. When the verdict was in, one person, we\u2019ll call her Jen, said she was out.

To be fair, I have said many times that I would love to have this done but it isn\u2019t something we need to be spending money on right now so we haven\u2019t done it.  He followed this up by saying that if I didn\u2019t want to spend the money, he would gladly just take the whole day and do it himself. When he told me this, I wanted to be very mindful of my reaction. Again, he has not been in the habit of gift giving or being super thoughtful when it comes to special occasions. I told him that I really appreciated the thought and saw the effort that would take for him to do but if he took the entire day to clean the house, I would obviously just be watching my kids and trying to keep them from coming behind him and messing all of his hard work up and ultimately that doesn\u2019t sound like a present. I felt guilty because I want to praise his effort but I also feel like this \u201cgift\u201d doesn\u2019t feel personal or thought out well, despite the effort. He didn\u2019t seem too upset by my reaction but now I\u2019m afraid he isn\u2019t going to do anything? I\u2019m also feeling a bit frustrated because if the roles were reversed, I would (and have) set something up where he would be able to go do something he loved with his friends and not have to worry about me or his kids. AITA for not just letting him do this for me? ",

        "selftext": "Me (32F) and my bf (30M) have been together for nearly 4 years now. Since a couple of months he keeps asking me to turn of the alarm of his phone in the morning. First he asked me only a couple of random days, but now it is almost dayly. He deliberately puts his phone quite far away from our bed, so he has to get up to turn off the alarm. Now I have to get out of bed to turn it off, and I HATE it... Like I don't even know how to describe how much it annoys and irritates me... I am not a morning person, and he knows this, and I have my own morning routine as to make sure I am not grumpy towards everyone in the morning. But turning off his alarm messes up my routine and makes me really frustrated in the morning. Even more so when he asks me to turn off his alarm on my day off. My bf has his own company and prefers to be early at his office. So his alarm is usually set about 40 minutes before my alarm. But sometimes it is also set 10 minutes before my alarm goes off. He will ask me to 'please turn it off one more time' and then stay in bed till my alarm goes. Now this is where I might be the AH, because the extra time in bed he mostly spends cuddling me and I really love it. Before this all started he used to turn off his alarm himself and come back to bed to cuddle, but that doesn't happen anymore.  WIBTA if I told him to either turn off his own alarm from now on, or just not set an alarm and get up when my alarm goes off?",

        "selftext": "I (38F) found out something about my husband (41m) I don't think he ever wanted anyone to know. I came home unexpectedly after leaving in the morning. Walking inside, I heard muffled music. Getting closer to our bedroom, I heard him in the shower singing along to something we'd never listened to before, and...I was blown away. A little background: my husband is quiet and reserved. He's very stoic and just doesn't like small talk, huge crowds, hates being the center of attention, etc. He also has a very unique voice, he's slim, but his voice is deep and very even-keel. There's been times we've been at karaoke bars and people have prodded him about getting up there and he always says something like: you've heard me talk, what makes you think I can do that? or do you really want this place to clear out? In the shower, he wasn't belting out, but he was singing along and he was good. Really good. I was shocked and frozen for a bit, but then turned and left, got in my car, drove down the street, and texted him that I'd be home in a bit. A couple minutes later he replied and I sat there for a bit wondering how I can possibly bring it up. I went in, and it was like any other day. He was in our room, hair still wet, Bluetooth speaker right back on the dresser where it always was. I didn't bring it up. For the next few days, it's really all I could think about. I'm not proud of this, but when he was out shoveling and salting the driveway, I took his phone and went into his Spotify, he had to've had something in there, and lo and behold at the bottom of his usual playlists there was one titled random. I opened it and there it was. All artists he'd never once listened to with or around me: some Bruno Mars, Shawn Mendes, Michael Buble, James Arthur, Lukas Graham, some much older stuff like the Four Tops, Stevie Wonder, and Dion...and then I saw it. Die A Happy Man by Thomas Rhett. Something I forgot to mention earlier. My husband HATES country music. He never complains when others are playing it, but if anyone asks him what he wants to listen to, he says anything but country. Says he hates the twanginess of it and thinks all of the artists are poser cowboys. Die a Happy Man is my song. I don't listen to it around him because he hates country, but it's my favorite. Years ago, when we were dating, I remember we talked about our favorite songs. He mentioned a few, and I said mine. It's the only time I've ever brought it up. He nodded and acknowledged, but said he wasn't a country fan and didn't know it. The fact that he remembered it, saved it, knows it, and even more than that, that he may be able to sing it, is burning me up. I want to hear him sing. I want to ask him so badly, but I'm afraid of how he may react. It's innocent, but it's still a breach of trust and if he hasn't told me or any of his friends or family then this is something he probably really wants to keep to himself forever.

        "selftext": "My wife, Emma, and I have a 16-year-old dog named Sky who was recently diagnosed with an aggressive, fast-growing form of cancer. The kind that can\u2019t be cut out easily.  Given this, Sky\u2019s age, and other health issues, the vet didn't recommend treatment. Instead, he's got some pain medication to help keep him comfortable, and we were told to keep an eye on the cancerous lump on his chest.  That lump has gone from pea-sized to the size of a large grapefruit in under two months. Sky\u2019s incontinence is more frequent, and his back legs now give out regularly. He doesn't enjoy playing in the yard or chasing a ball and has become fussier about what he eats. He's also sleeping more\u2014up to 22 hours a day. The vet has said as the growth gets bigger, it's more likely to rupture, which would require urgent veterinary care. At that point, it's likely that Sky would need to be euthanized. It's possible that this could happen outside of our vet's usual hours, which would mean we'd need to take him to the emergency animal hospital. Given all of this, I've tried talking with Emma several times about whether it is still in Sky's best interests to continue on. I think the time has come to have him euthanized. This would allow us to ensure that his passing was as gentle as possible, in a place that is familiar and without the added stress of a medical emergency. The vet has said it's up to us, and he'd support whatever decision we made. Emma thinks that we shouldn't put him down just because things have become harder for us. He does still wag his tail when he sees us and enjoys scratches, but the vet has said that dogs can be really good at hiding when they're in pain, and I think that's what's happening here. Emma doesn't see it that way and thinks that because he's not overtly suffering, we should let him live out whatever life he has left. Also relevant: I work from home, so I'm the one at home with him every day. We've discussed what I should do if something happens and she's away for work. She's told me I should do what needs to be done even if I can't get hold of her or she can't get there. It seems she's accepted that he's close to the end of his life but maybe doesn't want to have to be the one to make the decision to end it? Yesterday, I had a sudden thought that I should just tell Emma that something happened during a time when she's not available and take him to the vet myself. It shook me that I'd thought of it, to be honest. Our relationship is built on a strong foundation of trust, and I know that if I were to do something like this and she found out, there would be no coming back from that. Our 20-year relationship would be over. However, I can't stop thinking about how it could be the best thing for Sky. So, I thought I'd ask the internet: would I be the a-hole if I had my wife's dog put down and lied to her about why? UPDATE: Thank you to everyone who has taken the time to share their stories. I really appreciate all the comments (yes, I\u2019ve read them all) and I\u2019m going to take the advice to continue talking with Emma about what\u2019s best for Sky. Hopefully, I can help her realize that it\u2019s time for us to say goodbye but if not, I\u2019ll continue to support them both as best I can through this difficult process. ",

        "selftext": "I have avoided having this conversation with my wife for years. It has been obvious but not said that I don\u2019t trust her to go out alone with them not in our yard but anywhere busy. We live in a busy road and the sidewalk is in the other side of the street. She is completely blind and my kids are 4 and 7 my seven year old is pretty self sufficient but my 4 year old tries to run a head and is a little bit of a flight risk. She was telling me she cleans more than her share (she doesn\u2019t work I do), so I called her out on it. I cook every meal, sweep and mop the floors and spend more time with the kids work and on top of it I get the kids ready for school and walk them to school every school day. She then said she could walk the kids to school but I won\u2019t let her. I told her straight up no I do not think it\u2019s safe. She knows other blind mothers and I\u2019m sorry they are great in so many ways, but I do think there are some things that worry me about her being out in public alone with the kids. If someone grabbed my daughter she would have no recourse. If my son took off she would see where he went or be able to stop him. We live on a busy street and she can cross it no problem but it\u2019s about having to stop my child if they make an error crossing. When I walk my kids to school I hold their hands she has to have one hand on her cane and I\u2019ve seen my son pull away from her when we were out together.  I really am asking am I an asshole for getting upset that I felt she was unjustly saying she does everything and saying something that hurt her feelings. Not so much for thinking the way I do. She had not talked to me since and honestly I\u2019m mad too. I do a lot for my family and being told I am not pulling my weight makes me angry. I don\u2019t know where I go from here. I don\u2019t know if my anger and position make me the AH or if it was justified for me to say the things I said. Edit:It\u2019s pretty clear that I am the ass here one thing I wanted to say. I\u2019m sure most people here don\u2019t understand that sometimes when it comes to being blind its not just find a solutions sometimes you need the assistance of someone sighted. And I am not alone in thinking this she has an instructor who teaches her navigation and she also expressed concerns about my wife\u2019s navigation abilities without a guide dog. She doesn\u2019t have one because she doesn\u2019t have enough use for them to giver her one. They need to work often or they forget how to work properly we do not live near busses and she doesn\u2019t work so there is little opportunity to use a guide dog. Walking the kids to school is just one route there is nothing enough. I didn\u2019t put this post because my thinking she can\u2019t do it safely you guys don\u2019t have enough info to have a take on if she can you don\u2019t watch her walk. I was saying my saying it made me the ass.  Also it\u2019s pretty clear that the biggest issue is we are raising two kids with no family support what so ever her mother lives 5 minutes away but only see our children or my spouse once every month or two and even then only for a couple hours. My parents live far away. No one is not doing their share but we are both over worked. Edit 2. I talked to my wife and things are mostly cleared up. She knew I would say that and agrees she was just mad that it was not talked about. She has never gone out with the kids alone and it had become an understanding without a conversation. We both apologized and she did say (like a lot of you said) that she wasn\u2019t trying to say I wasn\u2019t doing enough more that she was struggling to keep up with the laundry and needed help. Just wasn\u2019t communicating well on both our sides  Edit 3. I clearly did not give enough details in the initial post I was writing fast which is also why there are typos",

We have a group a friends we get together with for Christmas/secret santa every year for the past 5 years. Each year, she would buy a gift for her secret santa and also put together a small gift for all our friends. At first since we were the ones hosting, I thought it was just a small party favor. But she does this every year even when we aren't hosting. These gifts usually consist of some chocolates, some writing utensils, some handsoap/candle/hand sanitizer from bath and body works. Since most of the people in our group are guys, they don't use most of what she gives. They feel like they are obligated to get her something too. I told my wife that most of it goes unused, but she said that she continues to do it because she just likes to give them gifts and expects nothing in return, and since we usually celebrate after the holidays are over, she's not spending more than $15/person. I finally just told her that no one likes the little gifts she gives them and she should just stop. She got really quiet and hasn't talked to me since. I know she enjoys giving gifts but why waste your money on people who don't appreciate it? Aita?",

        "selftext": "Some context to start out: I\u2019m self employed and occasionally do work for my friend and his girlfriend (they\u2019re not married but I\u2019ll say MIL to keep it simple). They have 4 young kids together. I\u2019ll be referring to my friend as \u201cJoe\u201d and his girlfriend as \u201cMary\u201d. Ok, here\u2019s what happened: I was working and get a voice message from Mary saying that she\u2019s at the hospital with one of the kids because he\u2019s having seizures and tells me that if I have any questions about the job I\u2019m on, to message Joe instead. (Turns out Joe is also at the hospital but I wasn\u2019t told this. This\u2019ll be important later) I drive past their house and see that Joe\u2019s van is on the driveway and think to myself \u201coh, Joe is home, he must be looking after the 3 other kids while Mary is at the hospital\u201d A short while later I get a message from Joe asking me to call him. I\u2019m about to stop at their house to pick-up something off the driveway that I need for the job so I think \u201cwell I\u2019m stopping at their\u2019s anyway, I\u2019ll just talk to Joe then instead of calling\u201d (I was less than a minute from their house). So I pull up and walk into the house and Joe\u2019s MIL is in the living room with the kids (I\u2019m very familiar with MIL, she\u2019s a friend of my parents since before I was born). I ask \u201cis Joe home?\u201d And she says \u201cno\u201d I say \u201coh ok, nevermind. I\u2019ll just call him\u201d She says \u201cwhy? You can tell me.\u201d (Remember Joe asked me to call him, I don\u2019t know what he wants to talk to me about) I say \u201cit\u2019s probably just work stuff\u201d Then out of nowhere she speaking very angrily at me, almost shouting and says \u201cwhy won\u2019t you just tell me?! Joe and Mary don\u2019t need this stress when [kid\u2019s name] is in the hospital! They don\u2019t need this shit and I don\u2019t need to deal with your attitude!\u201d I just say (I\u2019m still talking normally btw) \u201cJoe asked me to call him, I didn\u2019t know he\u2019s at the hospital too, I thought he was home\u201d She\u2019s standing right in front of me now with a face like thunder and shouts \u201cGO ON THEN CALL HIM! CALL HIM! CALL HIM THEN!\u201d I don\u2019t say anything, I just look at her like \u201cwhat the fuck are you on about?\u201d I walk out the front door and she slams it hard behind me and I just say \u201cyou fucking bitch\u201d She then opens the door again and says \u201cwhat did you say?\u201d I said \u201cI called you a fucking bitch\u201d She then calls me a dickhead and a few other insults are throw. I pick up the thing I needed from the driveway and leave. I call Joe and tell him his MIL just had a go at me and I explain what happened. (Guess what: the stuff he wanted to talk to me about was in fact just work stuff) I also explained what happened to Mary and she hasn\u2019t responded. I\u2019ve also been taken off the work van insurance (it\u2019s in Mary \u2019s dad\u2019s name) and I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s just it now. Looking back I guess she\u2019s stressed about one of her grandkids being in the hospital but that\u2019s no reason to blow up on me like that over nothing. AITA?

According to my wife, as she was tucking my daughter into bed she started crying and asked, \u201c Why doesn't daddy like me\u201d. My wife told me that the kids notice how I treat them differently and I needed to stop acting like I hated my daughters. I told her I don't hate them, but we don't have anything in common. She was pissed and started yelling at me about how immature I was being immature. I think it's stupid. Obviously dads are going to be closer to their sons, that's just how the brain works.

So Aiden then messages being like \u201cwell are you going to mail her some?\u201d(I\u2019m currently on the other side of the country) And I said \u201cnah, she can bake her own brownies\u201dI didn\u2019t feel like it was too much to ask because brownies are pretty easy to make. All of a sudden Aiden was saying that I was being harsh, then Abby joined in saying that I was being rude. I tried to explain that I just felt like brownies weren\u2019t that hard to make, and I said that if Aiden wanted her to have brownies so bad then he could make them for her. They got more upset with me for that. Then Abby sends me a message saying that she didn\u2019t appreciate how I was treating her Aiden or Dan.Aiden chimes in saying it\u2019s rude to bake something and not at least say \u201ci would offer you some if you were here\u201d At this point I felt like it was inappropriate to address this in the group chat with what I thought was 5 people that had nothing to do with this. So I chose to not answer the messages and hoped they would message me privately to figure it out. Rose calls me later and tells me that despite saying nothing to me Jane is also upset. She was telling me that they were talking shit about me in a group chat I\u2019m not in.The thing that made me the most upset was that they were saying things like \u201csomeone call her so she can\u2019t escape it.\u201d, \u201cShe\u2019s being such an asshole\u201d, \u201cher boyfriend is influencing her.\u201d. Obviously it hurt to see this side of my friends. I deleted social media and ignored all their messages. Am I the asshole for this situation? Update: A bit after I posted this I did try to speak with them, however it didn\u2019t go great and they didn\u2019t like or listen to what I had to say. it essentially dragged out more of the situation with \u201cDan\u201d to which I countered that how I treat him he\u2019s fine with (him and I act like siblings in the way of like making jabs at each other) and that if he isn\u2019t fine with it he lets me know. I\u2019m still annoyed that they might\u2019ve thrown away our friendship over brownies. Dan, Rose and 2 others from the group are all still on good terms and are somewhat trying to help defuse the situation and all admit it\u2019s stupid. So this is snowballing and I\u2019m just gonna ignore them for a while :)",

She won't invite her toxic parents which I fully supported; but there were a few idiots in the family who thought she should let them come because family and let bygones be bygones; they gave her c-ptsd so I always fully supported her.  Someone gave her parents the time, date and location of the wedding (her stepbrother told her they knew and planned on showing up but wouldn't reveal who told them).  So she changed the wedding venue and date; however since she wasn't sure who did it and didn't want them to find out again she went hunting for a rat so to speak and gave 5 different faux locations to 5 different suspects I ended up being one of them. The idea being wherever the parents thought the new location would be shed figure out who told.  Turned out the real rat was our aunt.  She told me and the others the truth that we passed the test and apologized but had to sniff out a rat.  I was deeply hurt she suspected me, I've been close with her my entire life and have never done anything to betray her trust and am very hurt for being accused of something I didn't do.  I told her im resigning as a bridesmaid and won't be attending but will send a gift.  She says I'm being unfair, she's traumatized and had to sniff out who the rat was, the only other option was to either uninvite the whole family or risk a panic attack on her wedding day (she said this when I suggested hiring security) if she saw them.  I said I understand but am deeply hurt to have been treated as a bad guy when i never betrayed her trust ever nor done anything wrong in my life to her, I've been nothing but a good and loyal friend/cousin and to learn she doesn't trust me deeply hurt.

We get along really well most of the time, but she does this one thing that drives me absolutely mental, she constantly mispronounces common words.\u00a0 It\u2019s not like she\u2019s joking or trying to be funny, she genuinely thinks she\u2019s saying them correctly. I\u2019ve tried correcting her so many times, but it\u2019s like it goes in one ear and out the other. Within minutes, she\u2019ll go back to saying the wrong version again. It\u2019s not even hard words. She\u2019ll say stuff like \u201cChick-fil-ee\u201d instead of \u201cChick-fil-a,\u201d \u201cliberry\u201d instead of \u201clibrary,\u201d or \u201ccipatol\u201d when she means \u201ccapitol.\u201d\u00a0 It is worse when it\u2019s personal things\u2014like the city I\u2019m from or places I love. We\u2019re in \u201cChiago\u201d instead of Chicago, where I grew up, to visit my family right now, and it\u2019s like she doesn\u2019t even care. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a learning thing, either. She doesn\u2019t have dyslexia or any speach issues; she\u2019s just lazy about it, at least that's how it feels to me. She very smart, studying for her master's while working right now, so I don\u2019t get why this is so hard.\u00a0 This all came to a head today while we\u2019re staying with my parents for new years. She pronounced Chicago wrong again in front of my family, then later did the same thing with my favorite restaurant. I lost my cool and snapped at her. I told her it\u2019s frustrating that she can\u2019t even try to get it right, especially when it\u2019s stuff that matters to me. I know I probably sounded harsh, but I was just so angry. I feel like a jerk, because when we talk, it's like I'm scolding a little kid and not a 24-year-old woman who should know how to pronounce simple stuff by now.\u00a0 She got really quiet after that and has barely spoken to me since we got in. She's been on her phone the whole time and now I\u2019m starting to feel like maybe I went too far. Am I the asshole for constantly correcting her or for snapping at her today? Edit: More info. I'm going to put this here because it keeps coming up. We both grew up in northern parts of the US, so we virtually have the same typical American accent. We both only speak English. We are both white. She does not have dyslexia, vision loss, or hearing loss, but there could be things I'm not aware of. She will mispronounce most types of words: cities, restaurants, places we go, things we do, etc. She is able to pronounce these words correctly sometimes at first, but might later change her mind because they sound better the way she says them or they are easier to say her way. There are a few words she misspoke when we first met, which I thought was cute at first. But it happens so often now, over the year we've been together, that sometimes I don't understand what she says, and she can't or won't explain what she really means. She speaks this way around me, her friends, and our families. I know I'm in the wrong for yelling at her, and I will apologise for that when she wakes up, but I just want to know why she keeps doing this. If it's condition, fine, I'm a jerk, but if she's doing this for some other reason I want to know why.

        "selftext": "I m(32) was sent to the shopping centre on the way home from work to get lasagne sheets for my wife f(35). I went to the pasta aisle and took a look at the lasagne sheets on offer and found one box that stated \u201cno pre cooking required\u201d so I assumed that would be a great option and got it. Today while driving to lunch my wife said to me that she didn\u2019t mean this as an attack but that she had told me to get fresh lasagne sheets, which are the soft ones in the cold aisle. I told her I didn\u2019t hear her say fresh when she asked me or I would have probably figured out she meant cold. I then asked her what the difference was and why it mattered. She said that the fresh ones cook quicker.I responded that it does say no pre cooking required on the box, assuming maybe this was a newer technology and so it wouldn\u2019t be as long.She said that didn\u2019t matter. I then asked if she had used the no pre cooking required before and compared the cooking times to the fresh ones, since we don\u2019t make lasagne much (I can recall one time in our 7 years together) and I wouldn\u2019t think she would have used these before and was making assumptions. She then started to get angry and said that we always get the fresh ones and if she says she w at the fresh ones then that should be it and she shouldn\u2019t have to justify why she wants them, if she says to get them then just get them. I argued that I always like to educate myself and will clarify and ask questions rather than ever just go ahead and do what you\u2019re told, that isn\u2019t who I am and I should be able to ask questions and clarify. At no point did I say I wouldn\u2019t get the fresh ones in the future or that I was right to get the no pre cook ones, I\u2019m just trying to make sure I understand what the difference is and that she has also considered the differences. She then said that the way I was saying it was defensive and right fighting and that she felt I wasn\u2019t listening to her because I was asking all these questions rather than just saying \u201cyes dear\u201d.I continued to explain that I was just trying to understand and clarify, I wasn\u2019t defending that I was right to get those sheets or that I wouldn\u2019t get the fresh ones in the future but she said it didn\u2019t matter because of the way it was making her feel.She wasn\u2019t able to clarify what about my tone or words or mannerisms was making her feel that way rather than just feeling like I\u2019m trying to understand. So I don\u2019t know how to avoid this in the future but not just end up as a mindless \u201cyes dear\u201d robot. Am I the asshole because I tried to understand why she wanted fresh sheets instead of just noting to get fresh sheets next time?",

I wept, went to therapy, did what I could to improve and occasionally, she would come back into my life when she was sad or needed some compassion from her abusive ex, which she would then exit my life again to be miserable because \u201cit\u2019s what she deserved\u201d per her. Well, last time she did, I got excited, we spoke about working things out, and I told my friends she said she was not going anywhere. Well, turns out, she was trying to work things out with the abusive ex while we were talking back in June. When I saw her at the bar with the guy, I approached her for answers which she denied me. She then went up to my friends, who at the time, welcomed her with open arms because she made me happy prior to the incident that follows. Well, she attempted to be buddy buddy with them after I left out of sadness and anger. Tried to apologize for how I acted. My friend wasn\u2019t having  any of it and told her what she was doing was fucked up. Basically called her out on her bullshit and how she should feel terrible how she treated their friend (me).Fast forward a coupleMonths later, she showed up at my door. She apologized, told me answers to everything I had questions about. But when I we hang out in big social settings, my friends (the few involved of the fore-mentioned incident) don\u2019t really have an interest in talking to her right now. The ones that stood up for me basically said \u201cshe\u2019s not taken accountability to them about how she acted and is just hoping that we will sweep it under the rug toMove forward\u201d and that until she approaches them like an adult, they\u2019re not going to be the ones to build the bridge like they did before and it\u2019s up to her.When we are all hanging in a big group (think 20+ people) she just don\u2019t talk to her. That\u2019s maybe 3/20 people but my girlfriend says that she feels this approach of theirs is them \u201ctreating her like shit\u201d. Which I feel is an exaggeration and is her trying to minimize her actions that got them feeling this way towards her. AITAH?",

        "selftext": "Hi everyone. My (38f) sister (51f) (let's call her Jenny) has 5 children who are now all adults: 31m, 30m, 28f, 27m, 24m. Three of those children (30m, 28f, 27m) have either very limited contact with their mother or refuse to have contact at all. She thinks they are being selfish and ungrateful, but they all have valid reasons for not being in contact. Her daughter (let's call her Lily) now has a young child of her own and, thanks to her unwanted advances from her former housemate, she's in emergency accommodation while she waits for social housing. She has been in emergency accommodation since before Christmas.  My husband (42m) and I offered her, and her child, the use of our spare room until she gets on her feet, but she declined it because it would lower her chances of being provided her own place. The problem is that she doesn't have her own car. We have lent her my husband's car and have promised her that we would help her get a car and that we would initially pay for it, but that she would have to work off her debt by doing some cleaning and maintenance for us, and she has happily agreed.  This whole time, her mother, Jenny has shown little interest in her daughter. They don't have the best relationship as it is, and Lily feels constantly let down by Jenny. With permission from Lily, I have been updating Jenny on the situation, which has led to Jenny complaining that she only hears about Lily's situation from me. Today I  asked her if she'd be willing to spend some of her savings (that she told me about) to help get Lily a car. She was angry with me for making that suggestion while not telling Lily that she had to start spending time with Jenny.  Jenny also said that she'd been asked to do this by another sister and that she was looking for cars as we speak despite not being aware of the requirements of a car. Apparently, she wants to tell Lily  that if she wants money for a car then Lily has to let Jenny  have access to the grandchild.  Lily has not once asked Jenny for help, it is all coming from me. I told Jenny that HER daughter was HER responsibility, not mine, and that she needed to reach out and help her.  Here's where I might be TA, I was a little rude in our conversation which was over text message. I stand by what I wrote (that she had to step up and provide for her adult child), but I wasn't very kind and I let my growing frustration bubble over and it showed in the texts.  Tl;Dr: niece (and niece's child) is stranded in emergency accommodation, I told her mother to step up and provide assistance. My husband and I are planning to sell a car to her for much less than it's worth and asked her mother to contribute to the car. I was a little rude when I asked her mother to help. AITA?",

I don\u2019t wish to leave as I have my whole life here; I just started UNI, my boyfriend and friends live here and my dog \u2018wouldn\u2019t make the trip\u2019. I am unable to work currently as I am chronically ill and am unsure of how my body would react to both full-time study and work. I get government assistance of $210/Weekly which will be unable to cover rent for anywhere but a single room in a share house but I won't be able to bring my dog. I am left in a position where I would have to financially rely on my BF more than I would like to and would be homeless if we ever broke up. I have brought these issues up to my mom and asked her for a bit more time until I qualify for student housing and can find a nice family to take my dog. However, everyone keeps saying that I am ruining this for her and that I should move overseas with them. She has dreamed of moving for years and is now \u2018able\u2019 to, but especially since her health is degrading, she is losing time to move. Should I give in and leave everything behind or do I stand my ground? EDIT:  Just want to clarify some things. - My relationship isn't new, its 2 years old.  - My dog isn't dying or old, she is just an anxious dog.  - My mom isn't actively dying, she is just getting old and has pre-existing health conditions.  - Yes, I could move to this new country but I would loose the specific program I got into that they do not offer there as well as my scholarship which would put me through Uni.  - I am currently applying to get more government assistance but it would only go into effect after she leaves  - I haven't had a job as my mother advised me not to and originally told me that she would financially support me through schooling  - pet friendly rentals are rare in Australia  - I cannot stay in my current house as the landlord doesn't want a first-time renter staying here.  - My family do not have anything lined up for them in the new place, no jobs, no education, no housing.   - I asked for them to postpone the move until the end of the year so that I can apply for student housing and rehome my dog    ",

I am broke highschool student) so I went to my brother's room and ask them for money and they said denied responsibility for eating and said that it was okay because my Dad gave it to them. I got angry at him because I told him that I didn't want them to have any of it, he said he wanted to repair the relationship between me and my brother by sharing something that I made. I don't think that it's his business to do that. He didn't seem to understand so I kind of told him off about the cake and how it hurt my feelings he still did not care. He felt like it was something useless to even talk about. Am I the ass hole for telling him off about the cake I made. Also for reference every single time I get mad or tell him off he just says I'm sorry that YOU got offended and never owns up to his action. Edit: this was not on his birthday it was 3 days after. Mom forgot to bake a cake because she has been busy with extended family passing. I also told me dad before I even baked the cake that they can't have it. Yes I wanted it to be a moment between me and my father. And no It wasn't a petty reason why I am not letting my brothers have it.",

        "selftext": "I, a 24 yo female, have been engaged to my husband for around a year now. We have a seemingly perfect relationship. We split bills properly, care for eachother, and have a good intimate life. This all started around a couple weeks ago, and I am still trying to process this situation and figure out if I am in the wrong or not.  A couple weeks prior to this taking place, me and my fianc\u00e9e were moving my things into his apartment, since it's a more spacious place, and ironically, it's closer to my workplace than my old apartment. Now here's where the trouble begins.  I am a cleanfreak. I need everything to be clean and orderly no matter where I am. That is just how I was raised because my mother has the same tendencies. We were cleaning out his room to make space for the new bed we bought, along with my other necessities I brought along with me. As we were moving out his old twin size bed, I found a tupperware container underneath the bed. It wasn't marked, nor did he tell me what it was. I assumed it was old food left under his bed since the container was foggy, so I marched to the kitchen to throw it out. Later that night, he began frantically looking for something. When I asked what he was looking for, he said he was looking for his moms ashes. I offered to help because that's what any normal person would do, and that's when the search began. I asked him what the urn looked like that he kept her in, and what he said next made my stomach drop. He said she was in a tupperware container due to the fact that he still couldn't come to terms with her passing (this was two years ago that she passed).  I turned pale, and when I told him I threw them away, he lost his mind. The story could've ended there having found them, but the only problem was, the garbage truck had already came to pick up the garbage we threw away.  Long story short, after a big argument, I am staying at my moms and my fianc\u00e9e has ceased all contact with me for the time being. I feel horrinle, but also, who keeps their moms ashes in a tupperware container?! Am I The Asshole? ",

        "selftext": "So it goes like this: my sister is getting married in five months. Her fianc\u00e9 doesn\u2019t have enough friends to fill out his grooms party. Instead of approaching me directly, he just showed up at my house a couple times that I wasn\u2019t available. My dad told me on accident that the reason is he wants me to be part of one of his groomsmen. This kind of pissed me off because he could have called me, texted me, something to let me know he was stopping by. I hate when people show up unannounced. I work at night and sleep in the day.Not only that, but they\u2019ve been dating for like two or three years, and I barely know the guy. He hasn\u2019t really done anything to try to build a friendship with me. He sits at home and plays RuneScape all the time. Isn\u2019t his groom party supposed to be the man in his life that he can depend on to back him up during his marriage? Is it not a massive red flag that he doesn\u2019t have any fucking friends and is a total social loser? Why should I have to plug in because he can\u2019t get off the computer and go make some? Don\u2019t get me wrong, he\u2019s done a lot of good for my sister, and he\u2019s good with things like using tools.. but am I wrong in that if he wants me to be one of his groomsmen that the reason should be because we have a bond, not just because he doesn\u2019t have enough friends to fill the spot? Should it not be a big red flag to everyone that this guy doesn\u2019t have friends..? I\u2019d rather not have more responsibilities during this familial obligation. She already wanted me to take photos. How am I supposed to do that if I\u2019m part of the party?  She is my older sister, but her fianc\u00e9 is younger than me. Maybe I should be the one to initiate some time for us to hang out? But to be honest, I don\u2019t care. I\u2019m single, have my own busy life, and feel like if this guy wants me to be close to him, he needs to man up and reach out to me. Tonight I get a text message that says to give him a call when I can. I barely know this guy. I really don\u2019t wanna do it, but I also want my sister to be happy. My family all know I\u2019m outspoken and opinionated. I\u2019m not a fan and his approach to asking me is just making it worse. UPDATE: Okay MIATA.. Spoke to my sister.. he doesn\u2019t have friends and this is her idea. I don\u2019t have to take a lot of photos because they have someone doing basic photos included. I\u2019ll do it, but i\u2019m going to invite him out to get a drink or something first so that a bachelor\u2019s party isn\u2019t the first time hanging out.  Damn, doesn\u2019t it say don\u2019t downvote AHs? \ud83e\udd23 \ud83d\udd95\ud83c\udffd ",

As the line starts to move forward, his mom shows up with a cart full of stuff. She looked at me and explained that she was his mom.

        "selftext": "AITA for telling my girlfriend my friend said she was ugly? I\u2019ll be as honest as I can because i genuinely want to know what people think or if we\u2019re just overreacting. Keep in mind everyone in this story is 17-18. I was at a party with my friend, and he made a remark that my girlfriend was ugly. He was just like \u201cwell she\u2019s ugly anyways\u201d. He says things like this a lot and dismisses them as jokes. I can\u2019t remember too much from the party since I was a little drunk but from what I can remember she was brought up and he said it. We weren\u2019t even talking about her negatively or positively she just happened to be part of the conversation. Anyways, when I\u2019m home I\u2019m on call with her and I tell her he was saying stuff which kind of pissed me off and I was a bit stressed. She asked what and I told her what he said. Admittedly I do kind of regret telling her since if one of her friends called me ugly I probably wouldn\u2019t be too happy and this could have saved a lot of drama. But she was very much not happy with him. She\u2019d told lots of her friends about the situation and one of which is friends with my friend.  Now the next day at work me and my friend were talking and my girlfriend came up, and I told him that she really didn\u2019t like him anymore. This led to him finding out I told her. I can\u2019t even really describe his reaction. It was like angry and confused and bewildered. He told me I shouldn\u2019t have told her that and that I\u2019m useless and she\u2019s being too oversensitive and that he only said it as a joke. To add to that last part he said he\u2019s always thought she\u2019s good for me and good looking. But I don\u2019t know why he\u2019d just say she\u2019s ugly. It isn\u2019t even funny. No one even laughed at it. Like why would you joke about that.  That last part is important because like I said earlier he says lots of stuff as a \u201cjoke\u201d and never knows when he\u2019s crossed a line. And since one of his friends is friends with my girlfriend too, they\u2019ve been talking about it and he\u2019s lost a friend because their mutual friend sided with her. So he isn\u2019t too happy with me. He says he\u2019s mad at me because I told her and he\u2019s mad at my girlfriend for being too sensitive.  Finally today we had a talk about it and I told him that she has every right to be upset and he really shouldn\u2019t joke about this stuff because it isn\u2019t funny and just degrading towards her. He never actually apologised.  I do feel a bit awful because I caused quite a bit of drama, we didn\u2019t have a big argument at work but it was quite a heated conversation and now there\u2019s rumours going round saying we\u2019ve had some massive argument. I feel like in some way we\u2019re both in the wrong.  And by the way, obviously my girlfriend is not ugly. This isn\u2019t even just my opinion it\u2019s fact. I\u2019m very proud to say in the time I\u2019ve been dating her I\u2019ve never heard a single bad remark about her other than this.  TLDR: I told my girlfriend my friend said she was ugly, he found out and was mad about that. ",

        "selftext": "I (24m) have a selfish and narcissistic sister, 'Sarah' (18f). I have written a post about her a few months ago, and explained why she's selfish and narcissistic . So, I don't think I need to expand on that anymore. But here's the story; Last Sunday, I cleaned the entire house, all by myself, around 1am because it's easier to do when everyone else is asleep. I cleaned the ceiling fan in the living room, dusted the shelves and frames, swept the floor, vacuumed the floor, and mopped the floor. I have no trouble doing these because I'm always home since I'm still studying, and my elder sister is working. So, it's fair for me to do the chores, although my elder sister helps out as well with the laundry and folding the clothes (I fold my own clothes).  Why don't our younger sister help out? Like I've said, I've made a post about it, and it's a pretty long story. To cut it short, she's simply just lazy, selfish, and narcissistic. Today, Sarah saw a bug or whatever and used a lizard spray to kill it. Lizard spray is more dense and oily compared to a mosquito spray. Why did she use a lizard spray when we have a mosquito spray? I honestly have no clue. So, I told her to mop the floor since the floor is oily and I just cleaned the house a few days ago. To me it's fair since she was the one who caused the mess and I was the one who cleaned the house. But she got defensive, saying Why me? Why do I have to mop the floor? (goes to show how narcissistic she is). I kept quiet and just gave her a look. She then got a wet tissue and wiped the floor, instead of mopping it (goes to show how lazy she is). Not only that, but she didn't even wipe it properly because the floor was still oily and the stain got worse because she used a wet tissue that is soapy (goes to show how selfish she is). She then went to her room without a word. In the end, I had to mop the floor again because she made it worse. I didn't call her out because it's just useless when dealing with someone selfish like that. It's like talking to a wall. If I had call her out, all she will do is get mad, play victim, and start a fight with me, which I'm not interested in because it was 10pm and also an unnecessary argument since I know I'm not in the wrong. To be honest, I'm writing this just to vent out. But what do you guys think? Am I the asshole in this situation? Edit: If you think I just hate my sister and I'm being too harsh on her. Keep in mind, the stain on the floor was literally next to the corner of our dining table, which is dangerous because anyone could've slipped and hit their head on the sharp edge of the table. Imagine losing an eye because of it. The fact that she didn't clean up the floor immediately until I told her to, goes to show how selfish she is. She literally just sat there, on her phone, while the floor was hazardous. So yeah, she really is selfish. Edit 2: The point of this post is not about her not listening to me or that she used wet tissues instead of the mop like I told her to. The point here is that she doesn't take responsibility for her own actions. If you made a mess, would you leave it or would you clean it up? Exactly. She didn't clean it up until I told her to. On top of that, she didn't even clean the floor properly, spreading the oil even more. Not only that, but she also just immediately went to her room, leaving the floor that she half-heartedly cleaned. Also, like in the first edit, it is dangerous because the floor is slippery. What if one of us slipped and hit the corner of the table? The whole point is about her taking responsibility, not about this mop vs tissue that so many are bringing up. Edit 3: Some of you are calling me the asshole. Okay, try putting yourself in my shoes. What would you do if you had just cleaned your house, and then someone, either your family or friends, just made a mess. Would you just let it go or would you tell them to take responsibility. Majority of you would go for the latter, right? Okay. Now, how would you feel after telling them to clean up their mess, only for them to play victim and clean it up half-heartedly, causing you to clean it yourself in the end? Would you be delighted or would you be somewhat mad or disappointed? Ask yourself that question and see whether you will behave differently or the same as me. Keep in mind, deep inside I was mad, but I didn't say anything. Just as written in the post, I didn't call her out or anything. I just cleaned it up myself, made this post to vent out, and moved on. Edit 4: Sure, maybe I'm the asshole for the way I'm writing this. But that's not the point. The point is about her not taking responsibilities. So please. make judgement based on the content of the story itself, not exterior stuff like the way I'm writing, me being emotional, the post is too long, etc. Final edit (hopefully): If you are wondering why a bunch of adults are living under one roof, I am Asian, and we live in Asia. It is normal for Asians to still live with their parents, unless they get married and have their own family. For single people, most of us live with our parents, even if we're 30 years old. At the end of the day, there's nothing wrong with it because it's just the culture in most Asian families, same as how it is common for Americans to live on their own once they start college. It might sound weird to you, but it's our culture, so please don't be rude about it. Besides, us adults living under one roof is not even the point of this post. I don't get why some are bringing it up when it's not even the main issue.",

        "selftext": "My partner and I live with her mom. She is very gracious in allowing us to live there so we can save money and buy a house. There is however, one complication. We have two cats, and when we moved in we asked that she gets rid of the toxic plants (she had a lot of lillies). Since we moved in two months ago, she has twice brought lillies home. Both times, we just said hey these are lillies can we move them, and she has no problem with that. Another time, she brought home a plant that was toxic, but I can't remember the name and it was shortly after she brought lillies home for the second time. A few days ago, she brought home a new plant that her friend gave her. I assumed that she had already checked the plant to see if it were toxic or not. Today, I looked it up myself and sure enough, its toxic to cats. When I approached her about the plant, I was respectful and just asked something like could you please check to see if the plants are toxic before you bring them in. Her response was saying that she felt attacked, that she didn't do anything wrong, and that because I helped unload her car, I should have seen the plant and looked it up then. (I didn't unload the plant from the car, just her heavy groceries from the trunk). We ended up getting in a heated argument. She was adamant that she did nothing wrong and that its my responsibility to look up the plants she brings in. I don't necessarily disagree, they are my cats and it is my responsibility...and I do look up all the plants she brings in. But after today being the third or fourth time she brought a toxic plant in...I just felt its not unreasonable to ask if she could look it up before hand. AITA? She does have obsessive personality disorder, so maybe her behavior has something to do with that? Or, maybe I'm just an asshole. Edit:  I should make it clear that\u2019s she is not a plant person. She only has like two plants in her house at any given time. She has one on the kitchen window sill( the one her friend gave her), and a bouquet of flowers on the kitchen island. She usually only has the flowers and changes them once a month",

        "selftext": "I (23F) have a friend (24F) who is currently in uni in another country. Her family is pretty strict so being far away from them made her go a little wild. Recently she was ranting to me about how her first kiss experience. She and her uni friends went clubbing, where she drank heavily and got drunk, but not drunk enough to fully black out, being still lucid enough to be aware of her surroundings and actions. According to her, this guy started approaching her, and they ended up grinding and eventually the guy kissed her, and it escalated into a full make out session.  The next morning she immediately regretted letting the guy do that to her and she called me for support.  While she described the story, it seemed like she wanted me to reassure her that the kiss didn\u2019t count or to sympathize with her. However, I found it hard to comfort her, or for sorry for what she experienced,  because firstly she knew her friends that went with her were going to be drinking heavily as well so there\u2019s no one looking out for her and she\u2019s going to be on her own. Secondly, she consented to the guy kissing her at that point (not saying no/pushing him/walking away) and also she kissed him back which was what caused the kiss to become a full make out session.  I knew she could\u2019ve done something because after the kiss happened the grinding continued and she began feeling uncomfortable about the guy starting to touch her inappropriately and so she walked away right away so it\u2019s not like she couldn\u2019t have done anything if she did not want him to kiss her. She just regretted giving away her first kiss to a total stranger who she doesn\u2019t even remember.  I didn\u2019t say much on the call and didn\u2019t offer the reassurance she seemed to be seeking. I felt conflicted because I think she willingly engaged in the situation and only regretted it afterward. However, I wonder if I was wrong for not being more supportive as her friend. I might be victim blaming as well for thinking that she should\u2019ve been more careful and responsible about her alcohol intake, knowing that she has no one watching out for her.  AITA? EDIT: I did not say much on the call as I was in complete shock that this happened to her. I was in no way judging her and I feel really bad that her first kiss (which is something she was looking forward to) was taken away like this. I am just wondering if I am the AH for not showing her the support that she wanted me to ie telling her it doesn\u2019t count as her first kiss. I did not tell her off or voice any of my \u201cjudgemental\u201d opinions I just listened.  EDIT 2: My friend asked me and I quote \u201cIt doesn\u2019t count right\u201d as to whether this is her first kiss experience or not I am not assuming anything.  ",

        "selftext": "My mil, husband, and I all live together. She can't drive so I usually do everything she asks for. She told me she wanted a cat, I talked to her about cats, looked for cats for a few months until we all agreed on a really cute cat, and then we got a cat. Afterwhich She told my husband and I that she NEVER said she wanted the cat and didn't even like cats after we brought her home. We kept the cat back with us, and we do everything for her, so she's our cat.  Now this cat is super attached to me, she's on me when I'm sleeping or awake, she stands vigil while I use the bathroom, and shes at the door as I leave and return. My husband says it's like she looks at me as her mommy, which is cute but I don't really refer to myself as mommy. However I heard my mother in law refer to herself as mommy... while my husband is referred to as daddy to the cat.  It makes me feel a little weird. I've always felt like she has looked at me as competition, I've had to tell her before she's not married to her son I am and the way she tries to overtake my position as her sons wife gives me the ick. I have let her step on me before, trying to keep the peace, but I really don't like how it feels.  So my question basically is, if I asked her to not refer to herself as mommy with our cat would I be the asshole?  Edit. This has already been solved. Thank you everyone for your help.",

I don't mean full on faking being someone else like identity theft, but like pretending to be a different person than she actually is. She would use a name that didn't seem to make sense for her and really just did a lotta weird shit. On Monday I overheard her talking and she mentioned a name that I thought would be her mom's. I went home and looked up the name she gave plus her last name (I memorized it because we had some assignments together and I would see her last name) on Google and found her mom on Facebook. I spent all night but didn't see anything about her but after a few days of looking I found a really old photo of her and found her real name. I took screenshots and texted them to my friends, who decided to spread them around. Eventually the whole school knew her actual name and started calling her that.   A few people and teachers still called her the fake name but obviously everyone knew she was a liar atp. I got called into the office today and she was there with her parents. They reported me for harassment and said I purposely spread out her name to get people to harass her, but in reality I just wanted my friends to know the truth and they were the ones that spread it.  I was suspended and my parents grounded me for getting suspended. I also have to apologize which I don't know why since she's being a liar. Apparently she's also going to another school now because of what happened but that might be for the best. Was I TA for exposing her when I knew she was being fake?",

Her reasoning kind of sucks because it's nothing more than just I prefer being indoors. The only reasonable excuse of hers is because of allergies but even then it feels like a cop-out because she could easily take meds for it. We used to try and make her go with us but after a while we got tired and would just leave her at home while we went out and had fun. Yesterday we were going on a hike in a forest nearby and tried convincing Scarlet to join. She refused again, and it lead to a fight between her and my parents. She then yelled something about how she hates my parents for forcing her to join family activities she hates so I jumped in and yelled at her, saying how she can stay home by herself like the miserable asshole she is and that I wished she could just be like us. She won't speak to any of us now. My parents said I was right but I feel a little bad that Scarlet won't talk to me now. AITA?",

        "selftext": "Throw Away because I may be TA here.  The backstory is my brother-in-law (35m) lives a block away from my husband John (22m) and myself (22f). We will call the brother-in-law Billy. Billy is financially very stable. My husband John and I are not. Billy is John's half-sibling who was raised by his mother's side of the family. Billy's Mom passed away 5 years ago and left him a substantial inheritance. Billy didn't have a lot of contact with his dad's side of the family. Once his mother passed away he reached out to be closer to his dad and brother John.  John and I have known each other since 4th grade. We started dating around the 9th grade and got married last year. Billy has never liked that John and I are a couple. He feels like we should have waited to get married until we were more financially stable, finished college, and dated other people. John and I think he is projecting since he is the child of a broken home.  So Billy is constantly involving himself in our marriage. One way he does this is to stop by unannounced every day. He eats our food and tells me I am a horrible wife and a terrible woman for choosing school over being a wife and mother. He also constantly questions why we have no children yet. (Because we can barely feed ourselves and are still in school.) Anyway, you get the idea; Billy is not a nice person to us, but he is family.  The reason I may be TA is before Winter Break I was up early and desperately searching for something to eat, like I said we are starving college students. Billy knows we are struggling and does nothing to help us out, but he continues to show up for every meal. On this particular morning, I found a half jar of peanut butter and some old packages of instant oatmeal in the cabinet. Like clockwork, here comes Billy waddling in for a free meal. I was stressed, about to take my finals that day, and worried my husband and I would not have enough nourishment to get through them. So I grabbed the jar of peanut butter and dumped 2 heaping spoonfuls into the pot. Billy is allergic to peanuts and he freaks out yelling that I am trying to kill him. Now he has the whole family believing I hate him and tried to murder him on purpose. Even John is saying it would have been a rough day but it would have been easier than to deal with this backlash. AITA here? EDIT: I am adding this edit to clarify that I did not try to feed the oatmeal to Billy. I added to the pot so he couldn't have any. That probably makes me an even bigger AH. It was a moment of weakness. EDIT 2: I want to say thank you to everyone for your feedback. John and I are going to take much of the advice. This has been very hard for us and we did need to hear some of this feedback. Thank you all for helping us get over our first hurdle as a married couple. ",

She's been putting off getting a job for a few weeks (she's applied to six over the past three weeks with no response) so my husband and I decided to put our feet down. We gave her until 8:00 PM to draft us a multi-week plan regarding how she plans to get a job (e.g. how many jobs a week? which jobs? etc.) She gave us a half-assed paper that said, apply to 3 jobs a week. We told her that this was unacceptable, and told her that she wasn't even really trying to get a job. She then asked us aggressively how many jobs\u00a0*we*\u00a0thought she should apply to, and I said that she should apply to 3 a day. My daughter then said, well then how am I supposed to devise a multi week plan if I'm already going to be applying to 21 jobs a week? We said that it's still a multi-week plan, consisting of applying to a total of 42 jobs over two weeks. She got very upset at us and cried and yelled, and locked herself in her bathroom for the rest of the night.

We have a 3 month old baby, I (30F) am on maternity leave and husband (32M) works from home. Baby is formula fed, feeds every 2-3 hours and needs to be held upright for at least 40 minutes after feeding due to reflux. So to make sure each of us get at least several hours of sleep in a row, husband and I split the night into shifts - he's in charge 19:00-01:00 and I'm from 01:00-07:00. I go to bed at 19:00. Husband usually stays in the living room until 01:00, then goes to sleep and puts baby in a crib by our bed. I on the other hand go back to bed after I'm done feeding/burping/holding because I want to try and get some sleep between feedings and this is where the issue starts. Baby would sometine get fussy between feeds, make sounds or fart loudly. If the fussing escalates or he starts crying, I get up and take him to the living room to handle it. But if I can calm him down by patting, pacifier etc., I don't leave the bed and go back to sleep. This annoys husband because just the fussing wakes him up. He asked that I stay in the living room, but I want to sleep between feeds if I can and sleep poorly on the couch. So I said he can either put ear plugs or sleep on the couch instead, I'm staying in our bed. AITA for not spending my entire shift in the living room?",

        "selftext": "Ok so I\u2019m really pissed off and disappointed at my bf of 10 years. On Thursday he had to fly from Canada to Jamaica for his grandpas funeral. He invited me to go but decided he wasn\u2019t going to bring me anymore, I was upset he didn\u2019t end up bringing me because he decided to fly with his brothers instead so whatever I had to just deal with it. We have never went on a trip outside of the country without each other so that\u2019s why it was disappointing. I even packed his suitcase and helped him convert money to Jamaican dollars and literally helped him with booking the ticket, even though again I was mad I still did it for him. He specifically told me he\u2019s not going down there for fun, said he\u2019s only there for the funeral and to mourn the death of his grandpa. Tell me why I check his location and he\u2019s at a fucking resort the day AFTER the funeral which is 4 hours away from his grandpas house? When I asked him he told me it\u2019s not a resort, he\u2019s at a hotel. LIES! I google it and it\u2019s a resort in negril, with a nice beach, pools, buffet, LOUD music. Who is he trying to fool? And yes that made me upset because again, he\u2019s there without me and I know he would be upset too if I did the same thing. And LIED about it. AGAIN, I was forced to get over it. So this is the cherry on top of why I\u2019m angry. Before he left to Jamaica, I sent him $200 Canadian dollars to cover what I asked for which was roasted breadfruit, which is hard to find here where I live. I specifically asked for 6 of them which cost less than $5 Canadian dollars. That\u2019s all I asked for. The only reason I asked for that was because I know his mom brings down so much food, she brings more than 6 roasted breadfruits, fruit, a lot of raw fish and bottles of wine and beer. So I know she had no issues going through customs. Tell me why he calls me today, I asked him what he bought me and all he bought me was 1 FUCKING BREADFRUIT. Mind you, I ASKED him and PAID for it so he can make it up to me by him excluding me on the trip. He told me he\u2019s going to have issues with customs and then called me ungrateful. I told him I only fucking asked for that and he didn\u2019t even try to make me happy considering how he excluded me and went to a fucking resort without me and tried to lie about it. Do I even have the right to be angry?? I told him he can keep it for himself and asked for my money back. AITA?Ps the reason I\u2019m so upset is because I have the biggest heart and do so much for him and spoil him and he doesn\u2019t even fucking try to reciprocate it back, I\u2019m not asking for the exact same but at least try. And he fucking didn\u2019t. ",

I knew from the get go that the products he made were of lower quality than mine but I thought his vending experience would be more important to Cons than the quality of his things (turns out, most Cons don't even ask if you have prior experience and just look at the products).  Why I would be the asshole: Breaking a promise is bad and he has talked multiple times about how he just isn't good enough and about how sad he is about all the rejections. I don't want to add insult to injury.  Why I wouldn't be the asshole: It turns out that his vending experience is limited to small Conventions. It seems like in most cases he was accepted, because all applicants were accepted. I didn't know about this before we decided to share a table. I don't think he intentionally mislead me but I would have made a different decision if I had known.   And for him art is a hobby, for me it's my job. The stakes are higher for me because my income depends on it.  Would I be the asshole if I break the promise I made to apply together and tell him that I want to apply alone?    ",

        "selftext": "I have this relationship with this 50yr old man (I am 41) who is through the final stages of finalizing his divorce. We have been dating for 1 year but until today I have NOT met his 28 year old only daughter. She has been married for 4 years now and she has a 1 year old boy. It is still uncertain as to why she has not visited or responds to my boyfriend's texts or anyone on his side of the family. He believes it is because he wants to sell the house he still owns with his ex. My boyfriend's daughter, her husband and their son and my boyfriend's ex still live in that house. They were given the option to buy him out but they all want the house to be sold to them to what it was worth back on 2013. My boyfriend he just wants a fresh start.  So last year back on November my boyfriend and I we were supposed to travel along with another couple to Cancun. My boyfriend does not have the hours and flexibility to take vacations as us 3 have. He asked to postpone the trip to March so we agreed. A few days ago while attempting to schedule the trip he told me he was not ready financially and time wise and he couldn't make the month of March either. I was upset but did not say anything. So about 1 or 2 days after this he confessed how much he misses his daughter and grandson and continued to tell me he can not believe how she takes up to 1 week to answer his texts. We continued the conversation but changed the subject a little and he told me that he still pays for his ex's car insurance (which is understandable specially since divorce it's not finalized) and for their daughter's. I WAS LIVID! I was like: Who? your daughter that is married?? (I was being sarcastic as they only have her) I asked why and he said because that is her daughter and was going to continue helping her. He continued saying he only pays $100 a month for her insurance and he spends that and more every time him and I go out to eat. My boyfriend and I we NEVER talk about money and where our money goes but I have a career where I make my own money and just about 5 months ago I bought a condo with no one's help so no, I am not after his money. We do not live together (he lives with his parents) but he does buy groceries for my house here and there but does not pay for any of my bills and NEVER gives me cash nor I expect it. He continued saying that he could not believe I was talking about his daughter and I responded that I could not believe either that after how she treats him he is doing this so what about her good for nothing husband?? Is this the reason why we are not traveling on March? After my friends and I bend backwards to accommodate him? He continued saying that he confides me his issues so I can listen but not judge So AITA? I was and I'm still livid..... ",

        "selftext": "  AITA for refusing to tell my friend where I got my bag? So, this might sound silly, but it\u2019s been bothering me, and I need some outside opinions. I (let\u2019s say 25M) recently bought a new bag. It\u2019s a really nice bag\u2014well-designed, stylish, and super affordable compared to the market price. I love it, and I think I got a great deal. A few days ago, my friend (also 25M) saw me with the bag and complimented it, asking where I got it. I just laughed and said, \u201cIt\u2019s a secret.\u201d He jokingly replied, \u201cDid you get it off the black market or something?\u201d I shrugged it off but told him, \u201cDo I look like someone who buys from the black market?\u201d He seemed to notice the convo was going nowhere, so he changed the subject. The next day, he brought it up again, saying he wanted a similar bag but in a different style and asked where he could find one. At that point, I told him, \u201cSince you\u2019re persistent, I\u2019ll guide you to somewhere you might find something similar, but I really don\u2019t like sharing my sources\u2014so don\u2019t ask why. I have my reasons.\u201d Now, here\u2019s the thing\u2014this friend has always been supportive of me and has dedicated a lot of energy and time to help me in life. But I just don\u2019t like sharing where I buy my things. It\u2019s just a personal thing. He seemed kind of annoyed but didn\u2019t push further.

        "selftext": "Last weekend, I had to fly out of town for my brother\u2019s funeral. He was a secret alcoholic and I hadn\u2019t seen him in 5 years. It was a rough trip. They had the idea that he would really like it if we went to an arcade bar and they kept buying drinks. I ended up having 5 voodoo rangers. The whole thing was weird. Because of the flight time and the location we ended up just staying the night at the airport. It was rough. Since I had no one else to help, I asked my best friend (let\u2019s call him Adam) and his girlfriend (let\u2019s call her Sue) to let my puppy out while I was gone.I was only supposed to be gone from Friday at 5 to Sunday at 3pm.  His parents (Mark and Lisa) also helped out. I called Adam and told him the instructions to take care of the pets, but I didn\u2019t leave a written list, which I now realize might have been a mistake. The original plan was for them to take him over to their house since he\u2019s about 3 months old. But Adam  didn\u2019t communicate that with his dad. And then the vet told us he had roundworm so that made it not possible for them because Mark  and Lisa\u2019s dog is old and they didn\u2019t want to risk it. When I got back, the first thing I noticed was that my puppy was in the wrong crate, he was covered in pee, and had chewed up the bed in that crate. So clearly, things weren\u2019t followed how I had asked. That already frustrated me on top of being hungover and exhausted and grieving. But I was too exhausted to deal with it at the time. My wife sent a thank-you text to Mark and Lisa but accidentally left out Adam and Sue. A little while later, Mark called me, asking about it and then straight-up asked if I was mad. The truth is, I was. because they didn\u2019t really do what I had asked. But instead of apologizing or acknowledging anything, Adam immediately shifted blame, saying it was my fault for not explaining things well enough, and got very pissed about me not saying thank you. Then Sue said I was being passive aggressive. Instead of saying something back I just told her that I\u2019d like to keep it between me and Adam because I originally asked him. I did shut her down but I didn\u2019t want her to get caught in the middle. That pissed her off royally though. Now, mutual friends are telling me I should smooth things over because Adam feels unappreciated and Sue feels disrespected. I do appreciate that they helped, but their reaction made me feel like they weren\u2019t being very understanding of what I had just gone through. AITA for not thanking them right away and for feeling put off by how they handled this? UPDATE: So I was going to Clarify on a couple things. 1. There was no neglect and that wasn't the point of the argument 2. I know I was frustrated over minor things. I would have never brought it up if it weren't for mark calling me and asking about it and pushed for an answer. 2. The reason my wife texted was because i was driving home and I fully intended on calling him personally to thank him and even joke around about my frustrations. I gave context in my post as to why I wanted to wait 3. I am appreciative of their help and I told them that when we were arguing, It did come off as not genuine. The whole thing got a lot bigger than I think needed to be and I didn't understand why. 4. I went ahead and talked to everyone and apologized for being frustrated and letting that overshadow my appreciation. Adam is still insisting that I should have just said thank you and bent the knee. The whole interaction I think is silly, but not worth being mad about. Puppies are a handful and he did a pretty good job all things considered.  5. Finally, some of y'all are out there. This was clearly a minor case of who the butthole is and coming at me saying I drank too much or that my wife carries the emotional burden is not needed. I definitely wasn't acting in the best way but I think a little grace is merited. I would really hesitate to wanna be friends with people who would kick you while your down. ",

About 5 nights a week she will come home with her girlfriend and play video games, if they come home early enough they partake in what I have made for dinner, otherwise they will shut themselves in the bedroom till morning. The other two nights the girlfriend stays at her place and stepdaughter comes alone, same routine though. I want to ask for her share in the power bill,  water bill, and gas. I know her argument will be that she can\u2019t afford it. She has had several car accidents and so her car insurance is high. She has a monthly car payment and she takes care of her cats. I can\u2019t think of another expense she would have.Maybe this is a no-brainer. I hate talking about money and would honestly just keep it bottled up and look the other way.

        "selftext": "Throwaway account for obvious reasons I (F30) got married a few years ago, and for my wedding, I gave my sister, **Victoria** (F28), enough tickets to invite whomever she wanted no questions asked. The only condition was that she not invite one specific person my fiance really disliked. She understood, and it wasn\u2019t an issue since, although they were friends, she respected our wishes. Now, Victoria is getting married. Weddings in our culture are a *big* deal, huge family gatherings filled with food, music, and dancing, where extended relatives, family friends, and even distant acquaintances are often invited. It\u2019s not uncommon to have hundreds of guests, and the celebration is as much about community as it is about the couple. Victoria hasn\u2019t really asked me for input on the guest list, which I understand, she already knows who she wants there. The wedding is still 9 months away, and I\u2019ve only asked her to invite **one** person. Just one. That person is **Alice**, who is incredibly important to me, like a sister. I\u2019ve known her since i was 10, and she even invited Victoria to her own wedding. However, when I brought it up, Victoria told me she hadn\u2019t invited Alice and wasn\u2019t planning to, not because she dislikes her, but because she\u2019s already over her guest limit. She told me to \u201cwait and see\u201d if there\u2019s space later. Her reasoning is that she hasn\u2019t seen Alice in years and that Alice doesn\u2019t know her fiance, so she\u2019s not on the priority list. But what frustrates me even more is that Victoria keeps saying that it shouldn\u2019t matter because she has already invited some of my friends. While that is *partially* true, the reality is that those friends are also *her* friends, she invited them because she wanted them there, not because I asked her to. I even pointed this out and said, \u201cWell, if that\u2019s the case, then how about we swap out a third friend for Alice?\u201d Her immediate response was *no,* because that person is \u201cher guest\u201d and is definitely coming. I know it\u2019s not my wedding, it\u2019s Victoria\u2019s and her fiance\u2019s decision who they invite. I completely respect that. I\u2019m not angry or trying to demand anything, I just can\u2019t help but feel a little disappointed. With so many people being invite, it stings that Alice, who is like family to me, couldn\u2019t be included. Especially when I made accommodations for Victoria at my own wedding **AITA for insisting she make room for Alice?** EDIT: Since people keep saying. Alice has been a close family friend for 20 years. She and Vic even hung out without me many times so they are not randoms. EDIT 2: Maybe using insist was the incorrect term since everyone keeps pointing that out. We only had 1 conversation about this where I said Id like to have Alice in the guest list and she said no, then we talked about it for 5 more minutes before it ended and I asked her to let me know if she changed her mind. Edit 3: I should have mentioned that we are NOT American. In our culture its very normal that parents and siblings get to invite their friends to the wedding and you are usually sat with your guests during the banquet so its not that weird that I asked about a specific friend.

The point was docked on a group project where the teacher explicitly said that only one groupmate should submit the project or else everybody would be docked a point. Now I was aware that my grade was borderline so I did everything I could to assure we would get full score, running the project through the teacher until she approved it, verbally confirmed who would submit it (not me), and created a group chat for the assigned submitter to provide proof that he submitted it so the group would be at ease. And so it went exactly as planned, yet when I got my grade back I realized we had been docked a point because another group mate, who WASNT assigned to submit, had submitted the assignment too, causing me to miss the A mark by ONE single point. Frustrated, I told the teacher this situation and how  I don't deserve to be punished for the mistakes of another teammate as I had literally done EVERYTHING to assure this wouldn't happen, I mean we ALL had agreed on who would submit it so I genuinely don't get why the other student did what he did. So either way, the teacher isn't willing to budge on my end at all even though I provided all the proof I had and even have students willing to vouch. I am concerned for what to do as in the end a grade is just a grade, but I feel I am being wronged from a grade I truly deserve. I discussed with my teacher and they said the grade decision was final, would I be the asshole to continue pushing her to see this clear unfairness and to hopefully right my grade. *I understand that life isn't fair but like cmon, what could else could I have done to prevent this situation? I tried my absolute hardest and I also have other commitments in my life too, I can't be following around my groupmates all day to make sure they don't mess-up on some basic instructions. I had done this same exact process on previous group projects with no issues at all, so this is super frustrating and I don't know why the teacher isn't willing to hear me out at all.",

        "selftext": "For New Year I (29F) decided to surprise my mom by coming home on NYE, as I just had a baby, her first grandchild, and have dinner with my family. I told my sister (23) I was coming, and wanted to order some food for everyone to eat. I searched for the best price and found a menu for $89.50 for 10 people. Apparently, the minimum order for these type of menus is 10, and they give you big trays of food. I asked her to split the bill with me, and told her that they could keep the leftovers to eat that week, and in case any of our friends wanted to hang out, we would have something to offer. At first she said she was not willing to pay for more food than we needed, and that she wanted to find another option for less people or where they would sell individual plates. IMO I thought the option I found was a good offer, but agreed to let her find another option. After 3 days I asked her if she found something, but she never even looked. We were running out of time so I told her I was going to pay for it and that she could pay me her half, which she did. I told my two best friends I was arriving on the 31st and I invited them both over, and told them we would have some food. My sister also told me she invited her BF over, which was perfectly fine. Flash forward to NYE, I was traveling home and told my sister that my two friends MIGHT come hang out but was not sure, to which she answered asking if they were going to put some money for the food. I said no, we already paid for it, and there was more than enough to share. I then asked if she would ask her boyfriend to pay for his dish. She said he was not coming anymore, but if he wouldve came, she would in fact ask him for the money. She said, and I quote, why do I have to pay for your friends' food if the whole point of ordering that much was for us to keep the leftovers to eat the rest of the week. At this point I was flabbergasted & in shock of her attitude and told her I was NOT going to ask my friends (one who was picking me up at the airport on New Years Eve, and the other who even when I was not there, would visit them bringing food and baked goods to share with my family) for money; that if she was in so much need of $18 I would give it to her when I arrived. To which she answered in a voice note CRYING telling ME I was an AH, was not empathetic with her and her situation and that she was extremely sad of my lack of consideration (the vn was 3 min long but that was basically the summary). At this point I was over it and about to take off so I just didn't answer. At the end of the night, neither of my friends went to my house. Four days later they ended up THROWING THE FOOD AWAY because it was too much and by the second day my sister was sick of the same thing (my mom\u2019s words so IDK if my sister actually said this). My husband agrees that the whole thing is insane and in my opinion I think it is miserable to be fighting over food and less than $50 \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f so Reddit, am I the asshole?",

        "selftext": "Hi reddit! First of all, english is not my first language, so i apologize if something is not written correctly. So me (17 years old female) and my family (Dad [47 years old] and brother [10 years old]) went on a short trip of 1 night and 2 days last week. We went to a near town (aproximately 1 or 2 hours in car from where we live) located on the coast of a river. This is a very small town and it only has a few bars and restaurants to have lunch and dinner.  The thing is, we were at a bar, and there were two musicians playing guitar and percussion and singing, and they where playing a few requests from the crowd. At some point, my dad suggested to my brother that he could ask the musicians to play a song from a band that my brother loves. My brother didn't know if he wanted to tell the musicians to play a song, so my dad went to ask them. When he came back, my dad said (and i don't know if this is true or if my dad just said it to cheer my brother up) that the musicians told him that they didn't know the lyrics of the songs of this band, and that my brother would have to sing (my brother said that he would sing if he had to).  The thing is, this band is well known in the country where i live, however is more like a niche band, even though it is known. The thing is that musicians were playing (and the crowd were asking) for popular songs that everyone knows, so i thought that it could clash with the atmosphere. And my brother doesn't sing very well. So at some point i told my brother that no one wants to hear him sing, and i told him to not sing. My dad told me that i shouldn't say that, and after that my brother said that he was agree with me and that he doesn't sing very well.  He didn't sing after all, but i was wondering if i went to far when i told my brother that. It's just that it would have been so cringe if he had sung, but if that happened, i could have easily left the bar and go to the hotel (to 200 meters of the bar), because as i said, is a small town. My brother doesn't seem affected for what i said, but i thought that maybe i owe him an apology, AITA?   EDIT: Thanks for your comments! I've been reading every single one of them, i apreciate your opinions. Special thanks for those who shared their opinions respectfully.  I accept the judgment; i was an asshole in this situation, i said something hurtful and unnecesary that i should have kept to myself. I will apologize with my brother, and i will make breakfast for him tomorrow (i usually don't make him breakfast) with the foods that he likes as an apology. Again, thanks to everyone for sharing your thoughts here. That said, i will uninstall reddit for my own mental health. Some comments were really rude and i don't feel comfortable here anymore, so im going to prioritize my mental health, because i realized that im not prepared to dealing with some of the comments. I were nice to everyone who i answered, so i just will keep wishing everybody a lovely day \u2661 Again, thanks for everything.",

        "selftext": "My girlfriend hates receiving gifts. She says it \u201cmakes her feel weird\u201d. She\u2019s absolutely fine with receiving money, but no objects.  I have recently developed a very strong passion for knitting, and of course im always getting comments from others (family, friends, strangers, etc.) about \u201cooh could you make meeeee something???\u201d And honestly? I don\u2019t want to. It takes a lot of time and effort to hand knit something, and I don\u2019t really want to give that away to just anyone. I\u2019ve seen so many posts and videos of knitters making gifts out of sweaters, hats, socks, anything that you can make, it\u2019s been a gift. Everyone that they have made it for has always loved it, and they express feeling proud looking at their knitting on the people they love.  I\u2019ve asked my girlfriend multiple times if I could make her something. She\u2019s always said no. Most of these conversations have been short, and we\u2019ve moved on afterwards. Last night it kind of came to a head though, and I was feeling really unappreciated when she said \u2018no\u2019 again. I really tried convincing her. I told her the effort and money really wasn\u2019t a problem for me, and she said that\u2019s not why. I told her that her refusal of letting me make her something really hurt my feelings, (and it was at this point in the conversation where I was holding back tears over it. I cry really easy while off my meds, and I have been for a month or so not by choice.)  She still kept saying no, and tried to change the topic so I would stop crying, but I held firm. I wanted to make her something, and I really hated that she didn\u2019t want anything I made. she asked why this really upset me so much. Through tears I ended up explaining my reasoning above, seeing others able to knit for their partners and have them love it. She went quiet for a bit and then said she will think about it. I was better with that answer and I let it go. we drifted off topic, and a few hours later she told me no again. I told her it was okay, but I was crushed. We didn\u2019t talk again that night, and now I\u2019ve woken up and been thinking about it all morning (yes I did cry a little too.) I just need to know, am I overreacting? Or is what im feeling genuine and basically do I even have a right to be upset over this.  Added context: we\u2019re both still in/around late teens, she is in college and im a high school dropout living with my parents. (Working on a diploma). The problem she seems to have is in accepting gifts, and also in the fact that for this gift she would have to measure herself and give me an address to send it to. I think it may make her feel strange to be so active in a gift, but if I make her something I want it to be something she will use. Also, online relationship. No weird age gap shit. Edit to add: yes I know this is really my girlfriend we have been dating for several years online, im not being taken advantage of. I know her general stature, measurements are just so they fit. I got the point that im probably the asshole, so im going to delete my throwaway now. Thank you for all the helpful comments.",

        "selftext": "I want to preface by saying I feel like this might be the end of my relationship. That\u2019s how serious this is to me.  My boyfriend (24M) and I (23F) have been together for just over 5 years. We were fresh out of high school when we got together and yes, he was my first serious boyfriend. For the past year, we\u2019ve been renting his Nana\u2019s house from her. She hadn\u2019t lived here in some time and the taxes/utilities were putting her in a financial hole. We pay her 1k per month, which according to her is more than enough. She considers this a favor, and so do we (because it\u2019s a steal).  I admit I do sometimes feel like a visitor. MIL always refers to it as \u201cBF\u2019s house\u201d, not ours. I\u2019m never in the loop about things, like when someone in his family will stop by (which isn\u2019t that often, but BF is always the point of contact). I\u2019m just\u2026 very aware that I may live here, but it\u2019s not my space. The problem at hand is regarding the temperature in the house. I am a very cold person, BF is a very warm person. So naturally we bicker about the AC/heat setting, but never anything like this.  We\u2019ve been sleeping with it on 70, which is fine. Last night I got off late (I work evenings) and saw he had turned it down to 68. I left it because I figured he was hot, but I texted him (he was asleep) and asked if he\u2019d click it up to 71 before he left for work. I sleep for about 2-2.5 hours after he leaves and get freezing in the bed alone.  I woke up this morning, freezing, to find that it was still on 68. I thought maybe he forgot, but no. When I texted him about it, he accused me of \u201ctaking advantage of our living situation\u201d by \u201cusing the heat however I want\u201d. He said he was sick of it being hot in the house and called me \u201cungrateful\u201d (??).  Let me say right now that the highest I will *ever* put the heat on is 73, and that\u2019s pushing it. Yesterday I put it on 72 at one point, which he bitched about and then turned it down. So maybe this was just fresh or something? I don\u2019t know, but I don\u2019t \u201ctake advantage\u201d of shit. *I\u2019m just cold*.  I\u2019ll also add that this past summer (which had triple degree temps), we slept with the AC on 67-68 every night because *he* gets hot. We\u2019re facing a freaking winter storm right now and the temperature is in the TEENS. I can\u2019t believe he would say this to me. I\u2019d love to know if I\u2019m TA here because I am considering moving out over this. Please put me in check if so. AITA?",

        "selftext": "My gf (23F) recently mentioned to me (23M) that she wants to have a night out with her friend from school. I asked her what the plan was and if she wanted me to go too. She said it was implied that I was invited but that it is more of a girls night. I asked who she was going with and it was her friend who she has told me some stories about. The stories were basically that every time they went out together this friend would get super drunk, try to get w dudes every time and would leave my gf alone for most of the night. Now idc that a single girl is going out and doing her thing, we\u2019re young and she\u2019s allowed to put herself out there ofc. But how am I supposed to feel comfortable with my gf going out w her after hearing all this? I do trust her, understand that they are not the same person and don\u2019t think she would cheat on me or anything like that. But how could I not be thinking she might end up in a shitty situation where she\u2019s alone in a college bar and I can\u2019t do anything about it? They\u2019d also be going out about an hour away from us. My gf would be driving and I told her honestly if she went out near us at least I could pick them up and that would make me feel way more comfortable. But this girl is still in school so she\u2019d go see her at a bar near the college which is another problem cause why would you drink and drive? She said she wouldn\u2019t drink that much but still. I told her I\u2019d like to go so I can meet her and get the chance to see what she\u2019s like for myself. That way if she\u2019s cool then i wouldn\u2019t care if they went out together because i\u2019d know her better at least. My gf said she\u2019d feel fine if i went out w my friends, but the difference is we don\u2019t go out really ever like that, they\u2019re all in serious relationships and she\u2019s met all 3 of them. She then said she\u2019s not going and it\u2019s fine, but clearly was upset and was making it obvious. I just don\u2019t want to be controlling and feel like i\u2019m holding her back from hanging out w her friends, especially cause she\u2019s been going through it recently in her personal life. But this does makes me uncomfortable, what should I do?",

        "selftext": "Hi, I (M26) have lived with my gf (F25) for the past three years. I had to discover in the hard way that we have different standards as to what counts as an \u2018empty\u2019 toothpaste. This is what happened. I went to brush my teeth before bed, when I saw that the toothpaste is empty. Meaning, I couldn\u2019t squeeze out any more paste on my toothbrush (and I try pretty hard, I squeeze it and twist it and stuff). So, I just threw the pack out and went to sleep. I don\u2019t remember the chronology of events exactly but I must have emptied the trash before sleep as well, because the toothpaste was \u2018unsalvegable\u2019 according to my gf. Anyway, she burst into the room super angry, asking where the tooth paste went. I say it is in the trash because it was empty. She then calls me a \u2018cancer-whore\u2019 (it was in Dutch, but I understood). She says: \u201chow could you do that when we have no replacement?\u201d, \u201cI have to go to work tomorrow and I won\u2019t have clean teeth\u201d, etc. She works as a teacher and is conscious of her breath.  Here you need to know something about her - she likes to shop for necessities (rice, pasta, toothpaste, tomato cans, etc) in bulk when they\u2019re on sale, so we often have a stash of this stuff in the attic. It\u2019s a nice thing that she does that of course, but it has conditioned me to not check for these things because I just assume we have some in the attic. Anyway, I must have thrown it out, realized there is no replacement in the attic, and then shrugged and went to sleep. I\u2019m thinking: \u201cwhat can you do, right?\u201d During our argument, I find out that she would have cut the toothpaste tube in half with scissors and carved out any paste inside that way. To me, this is a different standard, and maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m a guy, but I don\u2019t see the big deal in brushing your teeth with just water for one evening and one morning.  She brings up that the same thing happened with her face wash a year ago. She had cut it in half before, and I threw it out because it looked broken to me. It had resulted in a similar fight back then. I guess I had forgotten about that, but I do try to pay attention to that kind of stuff. So, long story short, is she overreacting, or am I being ignorant of her needs?  ",

I\u2019ll triple check the post before posting but you never know with these things. For safety reasons I\u2019m also going to change any names so that no one can guess as to who I may be talking about. I just really want to get some insight into what happened recently with a friend of mine, and see if I\u2019m really in the wrong here. But I (28NB) recently moved across the country for the first time in my life. I quit my \u201ccareer\u201d job, packed all of my belongings up, and shoved as much as I could in my car and drove over 800 miles to a new destination I had only visited for a week a few months prior (and fell in love with). I was living with my parents (technically my Great Aunt (72F) and Uncle(74M), but for this we\u2019ll just say my parents) and looking for a place to move out to anyways, and it was time for a change in scenery.  Anyways, the only thing I wasn\u2019t able to grab before I left for this life changing trip was my medication. I\u2019m very fortunate that I don\u2019t have to take anything SUPER serious (no controlled substances), but the meds I DO take tend to have serious side effects if you just stop taking them. Well, since I quit my job, my insurance stopped at some point. Also, of course, my last batch of meds were ready the day after I packed up my car and drove halfway across the states. Before that point, I asked my friend - we\u2019ll call her Janet(30F) - to pick up my them up for me if she could and send them my way.  She did, and then proceeded to hold onto them for a month and a half. In fact, I was under the impression she picked up ALL of my meds - because I had put in an order for all of my meds - but she didn\u2019t even check to let me know. I had to constantly text and remind her to send them my way because I was slowly running out of my medication and getting closer and closer to having to start withdrawing from them\u2026which I never want to do without the help of a PCP or psych by my side (which I didn\u2019t have at the moment because I JUST moved to a new area and lost my insurance). By the end of the month and a half, I had to get another friend to send them for me (who did it immediately without any trouble).  Something I didn\u2019t realize is that technically sending medication in the mail is frowned upon, according to google, at least. And as Janet so kindly reminded me, after a month and a half, she worked at UPS and let me know that they had constant drug dogs checking packages and scanners for the boxes to run through. But my boyfriend told me he had his meds shipped by his mom for years before across state lines without issues, and another friend of ours\u2019 dad actually worked at USPS and he himself would ship out their meds pretty regularly for years as well. So if Janet just didn\u2019t put a return address and didn\u2019t mention what was being shipped, what was the big issue?  Am I going crazy? Am I the asshole here? Am I just a doormat?",

I still made him go to school because I said it was his fault and it ended up hurting him real bad which I did feel really guilty for afterwards, my wife berating me a ton for the action and my youngest, would refuse to listen to anything I say (he\u2019s a mamas boy) and when my wife was away I could NOT get him to do anything at all, I told him like chores etc, he was slouching on the TV, and so I cast my phone onto the tv, knowing he is afraid of the Michael Jackson thriller music video and then held the door shut, my wife saying I was extremely out of touch for such a punishment?

I won\u2019t get too into it, our relationship needs a whole post of its own.

L has always preferred women, to the point where she\u2019s usually very uncomfortable around new men. She looooves me now (Def favorite uncle) but getting to this point took a lot of hard work, patience, and stick on tattoos. I never took her uncomfort around men personally but my dad did.

I know him, and I know that man has just fully forgotten his granddaughters name. L however didn\u2019t forget his name. How do I know you ask?

But I don\u2019t really like him\u201d I don\u2019t think this is a case of him getting old and losing his memory, because he can still bring up older memories and names of his friends he hasn\u2019t seen in decades.  My plan is next time he says \u201cthe baby\u201d I\u2019m gonna say \u201cThe baby? You mean\u2026\u201d and give him a name that is maybe 2 or 3 letters off Ls name, but rhymes. Think Hannah to Lanah kind of vibe. I\u2019ve already run that idea by my mom and step-dad and they both nearly spilt their drinks laughing. Would this make me the asshole?",

        "selftext": "My BIL (28M) used to live with his parents, paying \u00a330 a week for rent and food. About 18 months ago, he started spending more time at our place after his parents\u2019 dog turned on him. I offered him to move in with us so he could save enough to move out. My husband wasn\u2019t thrilled about the idea, but I thought it would only be for a few months. EDIT we made the decision together, i didn't go against my husband's wishes we didn\u2019t have a spare room, so set him up in our 11y/o son\u2019s room with a foldout bed. We agreed on \u00a3160 a month, which covered bills/food. However he quickly started complaining about doing the dishes (only chore we asked him to do) and spent his money on nights out and other stuff instead of saving to move out. After a few months, it was clear he wasn't saving at all. When brought up, my husband said BIL had until March to move out, he was shocked by the deadline. We offered until end of August, with rent increased to \u00a3250 a month, which he agreed to. But he would consistently ignore basic requests: keeping the bathroom window open when showering to avoid mould, picking up his dirty clothes, keeping his stuff in our son's room organised and not sleeping in the living room overnight, we spend 80% of our time in that room, it's a family room NOT a bedroom. By august, BIL is no closer to moving out which i KNEW would happen. Instead, he booked a holiday, started saving for that, showing he can save and taking us for complete mugs. Rent went to \u00a3400 a month, hoping that would encourage him to leave because we can't just throw him out. He viewed a place, it fell through, and he blamed his friend- told us WE should be having a go at his friend instead as if WE'RE responsible for him. He\u2019s now been living with us nearly 18 months, paying low rent considering everything is included (even toiletries as he has not bought any since moving in). He works full-time and makes above minimum wage. I no longer like being around him, i find him rude, entitled and arrogant. The tension has caused strain between me and my husband, I\u2019ve tried to talk to him about it (A LOT), but he doesn\u2019t want to aggravate the situation, even though he agrees with me. I\u2019m frustrated because every time i broach the subject i feel dismissed and i just need to put up with it until he moves out, even if it means letting BIL act/talk to me in a disrespectful manner. My husband isn't afraid of confrontation but can't be bothered with it as we're stuck with him in house. As he doesn't back me up BIL doesn't take me seriously and i feel like I\u2019m not being supported in my own home. He's had enough of me going on about it, I've had enough of dealing with the whole thing. BIL is due to move out in 4 weeks-he's moving into his friend's (+ friends gf and 4 kids) attic as he never looked for anywhere, the whole situation has left me emotionally drained. I\u2019m wondering if I\u2019m overreacting or if my feelings are justified. Our friends agree BIL is miserable to be around and I\u2019m tired of the cr*p i'm putting up with, should i continue to let it go over my head?",

        "selftext": "My (26F) parents own the 2-bedroom condo I live in, and my boyfriend (28M) moved in a few months ago. We discussed rent beforehand, and he was fine with paying. I initially told him $1800,  in addition to splitting utilities 50/50. He agreed. For context, comparable 2-bedroom condos in our area (a desirable part of Southern California) rent for around $2800, meaning $1400 per person. My parents aren't charging *me* rent, which is incredibly generous. However, they see the condo as an investment property, and the rent they would charge me is factored into their financial planning. I send them a portion of the rent I collect every month. I also pay the HOA dues and property taxes (which are substantial in California). Everything was fine for a few months. Then, my boyfriend was looking at rental listings and realized that *individual* rooms in comparable condos are going for around $1400. He also found out (from me, I wasn't hiding it) that I technically don't pay rent myself since my parents own the place. He completely flipped out. He accused me of trying to profit off him, saying I'm taking advantage of him because I'm not paying rent. He argues that since I don't have a rent payment, the $1800 is mostly profit for me. He thinks he should only pay half of what *I* pay in combined HOA dues, property taxes and utilities. I admitted that the $1800 wasn't just based on splitting a theoretical $2800 rent. I told him I added a bit extra because I'm the one paying the HOA fees and property taxes, and I\u2019ve been responsible for general upkeep of the place. I also have to send a portion of the rent money to my parents. I acknowledged that it's more than half of what a comparable room would cost. He's not having it. He keeps saying I'm ripping him off and that I should only charge him half the combined HOA, taxes, and utilities. He\u2019s now refusing to pay the agreed-upon $1800 and is only offering what he calculates as his share of the combined HOA, taxes, and utilities. I feel like I'm being reasonable. I'm not trying to get rich off him. I'm just trying to cover the actual expenses associated with the condo. Am I the asshole here? Should I just lower the rent to appease him, even though I feel like I'm not doing anything wrong? This is making things incredibly awkward. EDIT: There is no mortgage. My parents bought the place cash as investment property. I have been living here rent free for about 8 years and have done some remodeling at the time, and have had friends as roommates here and there whom i also charged rent, but usually those cases were when those friends were suffering financially so they paid under market value.  My parents did not ask me to charge my boyfriend rent or for me to send them money, they basically say it's my choice to use the place as I want for now.  I send them 1k a month because technically it is their place and so I feel they should get a share of the rent. EDIT - UPDATE   For everyone assuming/asking if I am pocketing the money. NO I AM NOT.  It;s like this:  I send 1k to my parents since it's their place, and every time I've had a roommate I've sent them a portion of the rent without them having to ask. BECAUSE they bought this place as an investment property. I was originally going to fic it up and rent it out but stayed longer than I planned and they have never charged me rent. So I am holding them back from it being a full time rental property so of my own initiative I am sending them rent whenever I have roommates before they can ask me for it.  1k to parents $500 - HOA dues  $100-150/mo utilities Property taxes - somwehere between 5-10k/year So I'm usually left with $150-200 every month after paying my parents and HOA and utilities, and even combined over a year it would still not cover even half the property taxes, which I am willing to keep covering fully myself.   I am not pocketing anything or making any money from what I charge my boyfriend for rent. ",

He didn\u2019t even move to grab his stuff. I stayed quiet. I was unhappy and frustrated but didn\u2019t say anything. Didn\u2019t even glare. I frowned, cause that was a dick move. But I just bounced anxiously hoping things went quick.  Another passenger sitting in a row near me got my attention and said, \u201chey, we\u2019re all late for our connecting flights so maybe be respectful.\u201d  \u2026. \ud83d\ude21I frowned and took a breath. I looked at him and said very politely, \u201cI am being respectful. I\u2019m not yelling or cursing or asking people to move. I\u2019m not screaming or whining that I\u2019m gonna miss my flight. Nor am I giving anyone dirty looks. I\u2019m standing here being as patient as possible because I understand that.\u201d  Which believe me was a feat considering I had barely just taken my anxiety pills for the day, not that they needed to know that. \ud83d\ude12 It felt like I was being chastised by a stranger for being anxious and showing a modicum of emotion. I was quiet, obviously annoyed but not directing it towards anyone or anything. I don\u2019t think I was being disrespectful. Yes I was trying to jump ahead because my next flight was supposed to be boarding. Was it rude to try and get off before others who had time between their flights? Was it disrespectful simply because I was the last row in the plane and should wait seated for everyone else to off board and potentially miss my flight because others weren\u2019t moving without a sense of urgency? Or was it the emotional distress I was showing that was disrespectful part? AITA?  If so I humbly accept the title, but if I am, why so I can understand.

        "selftext": "Me (24F) and Alex (29M) met a few years ago and he quickly became one of my best friends. He admitted early on in our friendship that his girlfriend Emma was worried about me flirting with him. I told Alex I was a lesbian and that my interest in him was 100% platonic. That seemed to settle the issue. As time went on, though, I could tell Emma and I would not become friends. Alex and I get along because we both have a very extroverted and dynamic personality and like to try new things all the time, whereas Emma is super introverted. Because of this, she's never really integrated our friend group and doesn't attend any of our outings, but Alex assured me they're both fine with this dynamic. A few weeks ago, our friend group decided to rent an Airbnb for a week-end out of town. Emma was offered to join but declined. The plan was that the couples would share beds and those of us who didn't come with our partners would each have our own bed/couch. When we arrived though, it became clear that some of us would sleep very uncomfortably as the couches were super small and hard. I proposed that those of us who came alone share beds so that no one would have to sleep on these couches. Everyone was on board and it was agreed that Alex and I would sleep in the same bed. I made sure to ask Alex if Emma would be ok with it, and he said yes. It didn't feel awkward at all, we were multiple people sleeping in one room, so it just felt like a fun sleepover. A couple of days later, though, Alex sent me a long message saying Emma was upset, because she still couldn't believe I didn't have feelings for him. This had caused a huge argument between them and she'd asked him not to talk to me anymore. He told me that he needed some space to figure things out. I'm extremely conflicted about this, because  I understand how Emma feels - she's been cheated on in her last relationship, and Alex and I have a very strong bond. We hang out very often, and are both comfortable showing our affection by hugging each other and saying I love you. I understand that this can seem odd to some people, but it works for us, and that's how most of my friendships go. On the other hand, I'm really upset that my sexuality keeps being questioned. I've stated from the very beginning that I was a lesbian, the love I feel for my guy friends is completely platonic. Alex has also made it super clear with me that he'd never thought of me that way and he's never done or said anything that made me doubt this statement in the 3+ years that we've been friends. He treats me like a younger sister and I trust him 100%. This may be delusional of me, but I don't want to go though life holding back because of social norms when me and my friends know exactly what we mean to each other. I don't really care if strangers interpret my intense love for the people around me as more than what it is, but I also don't want to hurt anyone. Was I an asshole for offering we share a bed when I knew his girlfriend was already a bit insecure about our relationship?  _________________________________________________________________________________________ EDIT - some precisions about our whole situation: - Alex and Emma do not live together. They'd been dating for six months when we met. - There were two other guys Alex could have shared a bed with. These two guys are straight and also have girlfriends. It was agreed Alex and I would sleep together because we're closer than I am to these other guys. - I don't know if Alex texted Emma to ask her about sharing a bed with me in the moment, or if he just assumed she would be fine. - I do have a girlfriend. My girlfriend has shared a bed with straight women and men in similar scenarios and that has not bothered me - we trust each other.",

The law in my city states we get 2 free months of rent in these situations. (15K in our situation)  But the new owner wants us out faster than that and offered us $30K to be out at the end of the month. We took it but now we have to divvy up the money. My thinking is we should take the first 15K and divide it by what we pay for rent normally, then the extra 15K on top will be split evenly 5 ways.  Everyone else thinks we should split the entire 30K by how everyone pays rent. Which i think is ridiculous, because that extra $15K was never part of the plan. No one should be entitled to a percentage of something they didn\u2019t pay into? They\u2019re thinking about it like a business, an investment. But rent is a bill, not a business. That extra money came about purely bc of a situational issue, not bc more money was \u201cinvested\u201d I feel taken advantage of by my friends and even my own boyfriend.  EDIT: the extra $15,000 is coming from the new owners not our rental property manager, it\u2019s not tied to a rental agreement",

        "selftext": "Hi so currently I\u2019m in a situation and I\u2019d like an outside perspective as my family think I\u2019m an asshole!! Sorry in advance if there is any spelling mistakes and punctuation errors, I\u2019m typing this fast as my wife is getting our daughter ready for bed. So I Adam (19M) is married to Keeley (19F) and between us we have a little girl Iris (3F) turning 4 in a few weeks. Keeley and I got married last year after being together for 6 almost 7 years - we got together at 13 and we have been friends since the age of 10 . During our entire friendship and beginning of our relationship Keeley had no minim/ non existent relationship with her dad - he pretty much abandoned her and her siblings and from what she\u2019s told me over the years, he was an absent father throughout her entire childhood. Keeley\u2019s mum met her step dad when Keeley was around 6, and from then on her dad became even more absent and when he would have her and the siblings, she would be the one looking after everyone when only being the middle child. During last year\u2019s wedding preparations Keeley\u2019s dad wanted to walk her down the aisle on her wedding day. I didn\u2019t see the problem with that but Keeley was set in her ways and told me and her entire extended family that her step dad was going to walk her down the aisle and if anyone had a problem with it they would have been uninvited to the wedding. Fast forward to now, I\u2019ve been meeting with her dad, we will call him Ben (46M) every couple of weeks to catch up and update him on how iris and Keeley is getting along ( iris is in nursing and Keeley is going to uni in September to be a nurse). This week when I met up with Ben he expressed a desire to get to know his granddaughter as he said \u201che doesn\u2019t know how long he\u2019s got left) let me preface this by saying Ben has tried to use this tactic over the last to get Keeley to talk to him and as Keeley told me he used this as an excuse when she was kid, when she wouldn\u2019t do something he wanted.. but I don\u2019t know if he is being honest or if he is actually gonna die soon. I guess I want Keeley to talk to her dad, as I didn\u2019t have a dad growing up, my dad died when I was 9 years old - that\u2019s the reason we moved and then that\u2019s when I met Keeley. He wants me to bring iris to our meet ups or ask Keeley to hear him out. After the conversation I went to my mums house to ask for advice and she said i definitely shouldn\u2019t bring up this up to keeley and to stop meeting up with ben. I\u2019m considering just telling keeley everything and dealing with the fall out afterwards.So Reddit, Would I be the asshole if I asked my wife to talk to her dad? I don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t think of this but this is the only relationship I\u2019ve ever been in and I\u2019m actually super close to her step dad.  Edit - hello everyone! I just want to say thank you for all the comments and messages I\u2019ve received. Firstly, I wanna address people this story and account fake - I can assure you it is not, this is my real life and the account is a burner account as I do have a normal Reddit account and I have done since I was 15 Keeley just follows that one so I had to make a new one to address this matter. Secondly, people saying my story doesn\u2019t match up with our ages, we had our daughter at 16, which is almost 4 years ago, I turn 20 on the 16th January and then iris turns 4 on the 25 of February and then the following month Keeley turns 20. Keeley is starting uni in September as she took some time out of education to be 100% present for iris first 9 months that\u2019s the reason she is going. Also when I say iris is in nursery, I mean it\u2019s like a play group thing she goes to everyday, my mother in law takes her for a few hours while I\u2019m at work and my wife is at college. I just also wanna preface this by saying No, iris was never planned, we never planned to have kids till at least our twenty\u2019s, but when we found out Keeley was pregnant we had a long talk and decided that we both could do it and she\u2019s an amazing mum. In the last 3 years Ben has had nothing to do with Iris - as some messages were saying - and it wasn\u2019t due to my wife\u2019s lack of trying, he didn\u2019t want have that relationship with her. Lastly, after reading through all you\u2019re comments I can clearly tell I\u2019m a huge arsehole, Keeley has no idea I\u2019ve been meeting with her father and as some of you have said it\u2019s a huge breach of trust which is completely is. A lot of you are saying that he is using the situation with my dad against me and I never thought of this until it was mentioned. When thinking back to our meetings I can definitely say this is the case, him bringing up how, he thinks that my relationship with my dad would be now or how my own fathers relationship with my daughter would be. The people saying that this is a reason for Keeley to leave/ divorce me is a bit far fetch, Keeley is an understanding woman and she would never do something like that unless it was absolutely necessary. I\u2019m writing this on the way to wok. Tonight when I get him I\u2019m gonna to show Keeley this post, comments and all the messages I\u2019ve received and we shall go from there. I wanna say thank you to everyone who took the time to read this post, even tho I\u2019m a hide asshole. ",

        "selftext": "I (21F) have been slowly pulling away from my mom as her obsession with rocks accelerates. When I was a kid, she would grab a couple rocks every time that we would go outside, either on a walk, or at the beach, or when we were at the park. As a kid, I didn't see anything wrong with it. I grabbed random stuff off the ground too and she always encouraged my curiosity. So when I saw her pick up some rocks, I'd bring a stick home. It even got to a point that my stockings as a kid contained rocks. Now I know it's not coal, but in a house full of rocks, I didn't want any for Christmas. When we'd get home, she'd wash them thoroughly and would put it somewhere in the house. Now these weren't big boulders or anything. I think the biggest one I'd see her bring home would fit in the palms of her hands? But for over 21 years, rocks have consumed our home. It wasn't until I started to become a teenager that I noticed how disruptive this became to both her life and mine. Our walks would stop every 5 minutes for her to dig in the dirt looking for a rock. She'd have me start carrying some of them for her. And with 21+ years of collection, they're everywhere. All over our tables, the mantle, the countertops, on the toilet, ROCKS. One time, I had a friend over and when we walked in the door, she was elbows deep in the sink washing rocks. I have never been more embarrassed in my life. And I never brought anyone home since, not even any boyfriends I've had. Now that I'm in college, I find myself finding any excuse to not go home. I've tried telling her that maybe she has enough rocks and should stop but she say that the rocks just speak to her. I didn't go home for the holidays and she's been constantly texting me asking why I haven't been home and that she's so lonely that I'm not around. This resentment has been slowly building my whole life and so I blurted out Those rocks are your friends. They're the reason that you have no friends and are alone all the damn time because nobody wants to be around a person like that. She started crying and hung up. I think she needs a reality check but my roommate overheard and thinks that I was harsh and that she's my mom. AITA for telling my mom that her obsession is why she has no friends?",

        "selftext": "I 40f and my husband 42m have two wonderful kids 10m and 7f.  Our kids have never been the best of friends or even got along that well most the time, they would bicker and argue with each other call each other names and do things they knew annoyed the other to purposefully get under their skin.  I don't want to go in to detail but we've had some financial issues lately that caused a bit of a strain on our marriage, we would argue a lot late at night when the kids were in bed and often wouldn't go to bed ourselves until 2 or 3 :am ( even when we had work the next day).  I'm ashamed to say that it turns out our kids would often wake up and hear our late night arguments and this actually gave our daughter nightmares, I found this out when I went to wake my son and saw his sister in bed with him, that's when he told me she had a nightmare and got in bed with him because my husband and were still up fighting.  This broke my heart to know we made our daughter scared and weren't  there to comfort her,  we made sure to keep our arguments as quiet as possible and reasured our daughter that sometimes mommy and daddy fight but she didn't need to worry about that and everything would be okay.  We kept our arguments to a minimum and were as quiet as possible, but our daughter still had nightmares the next few nights and got in bed with her brother.  We were able to get a handle on our financial issues and stop fighting so much. We reassured the kids that  everything would be okay and that they didn't have to worry. After a few nights our daughter was back to sleeping in her owne bed.  Ever since then our kids have gotten much closer, they play together, watch shows together, goof around together, and treat each other with much more love and respect then they used to. They even hug each other goodnight every night.  They still have arguments and bicker but it's much less and they  have an overall very loving relationship.  Today my daughter drew her brother a picture of the two of them playing in our yard with the words  best big brother in the world written really big on top.  My son loved it and showed it to us and asked if we could have it framed, as I mentioned we have been having financial issues lately and I really don't think we could afford to frame it.  I told him he didn't need to frame it, he could just hang it up on the wall. But he said he wanted to frame it because special pictures get framed and this is the most special picture he has. I tried to tell him gently that we can't afford to frame it but he and his sister are still upset.  I asked my husband about it and he said maybe we should get it framed because it's so special to our son and there new found closeness could maybe be hurt by us refusing to frame it.  The last thing I want to do is hurt there new close relationship but I still don't think we can afford to get it framed.  AITA? Edit: We went to Walmart and got our son a frame for his sister's picture, we put it up on his wall right across from where his bed is and he absolutely loves it!  We're very glad his relationship with his sister is so much better and seeing her picture for him everyday means so much to him. We're so glad we were able to get a frame for him.  Some of you seemed to get the idea we were just cheap or that we just didn't want to spend money on the kids, that's absolutely not the case. The kids have lots of toys, their owne bikes and phones and of course all the essentials.  My husband and i didn't realize that there were options for cheap picture frames but we were delighted to find out there were.  Thank you all! ",

I wanted him to go to individual therapy, but he said I have issues too but I can\u2019t afford therapy for myself, which is why we\u2019re in couples. I don\u2019t like it only because I feel like we\u2019d be better if we individually got therapy but he\u2019s insisting couples and he\u2019s paying for it. That\u2019s a little background, here\u2019s the issue: This morning I was trying to do my school work as quietly as possible to not disturb him- let\u2019s call him C for now- and all of a sudden C yelled at me \u201cHow\u2019s laundry coming up?\u201d Now I say \u201cyell\u201d loosely, it was mostly his tone that caught me off guard. I thought at first he was joking around and I replied \u201cfine, how\u2019s the stove coming?\u201d Cause C hasn\u2019t cleaned the stove in a month and a half and I hadn\u2019t put up my laundry from last night so I thought we were being funny. We weren\u2019t. He started saying \u201cit\u2019ll get done when I f*cking get up, get in here and do your laundry else it\u2019ll be in the basket for 17 f*cking days.\u201d I was at this point really upset but part of couples therapy is not saying anything mean to each other and i had nothing nice to say so I started doing laundry in the room, on the bed. Thinking C was now wide awake and gonna get up, i just threw shirts at the end of the bed by his foot just to get started, and C immediately got upset again and said \u201cThe f*ck are you doing? Obviously you\u2019re gonna wake me up if you do laundry on top of me go do it in the living room we have a couch.\u201d And waved me off.  3 hours went by and C finally got up and started asking why I did that, why I was doing an idiot move, if it was me trying to force him up or say \u201cf*ck you\u201d to him and I was already upset cause the way he talked to me previously made me feel like an idiot and all these emotions bubbled over and I screamed at him \u201cI wasn\u2019t trying to do anything I was just trying to do the laundry like you said! I don\u2019t care!\u201d  C then got mad and told me to go into another room for ten minutes to calm down and I\u2019ve been in this room crying hysterically because I just feel like I\u2019m going crazy, am I the asshole here? Am I really just so deranged I don\u2019t see what I did wrong? Please give honest answers I just really need someone outside of this to tell me what I did or didn\u2019t do. ",

        "selftext": "We have a lot of kids age 14 down to age 2 with another baby on the way. Everyone age 4 and up has assigned chores throughout the day but the biggest portion of them happen after school from 4-5pm but it takes a ton of effort to keep them on task. Example of the expectations is for the 14 year old: pick up dog poop in the backyard, fold & put away his laundry, clean his room (that it shared with 2 younger brothers & they all need to help), brush his dog, and collect trash from the main level once a week. I ask each kid to pitch in on what they can handle for their age & then try to hold them accountable for what their assignments are.  It is not as stressful on nights when we don\u2019t have to rush older kids to get changed into uniforms & out the door by 5:15 to have my husband take them to activities because then it\u2019s just eating into their free time if it\u2019s not done yet. I feel stressed by being left with all the little kids in a chaotic environment which means I have to watch them closer if it\u2019s not tidy and toddler safe and have to get dinner on the table plus grade my 8th & 7th graders homeschool assignments while my husband and the helpful kids are out of the house.  So I asked my husband who teleworks to come out of his office when he\u2019s done with work (sometime between 4:30 and 5) to help manage kids so I\u2019m not doing it alone with so many moving parts. He agreed to help more but he doesn\u2019t care if kids are actually done or not and still takes off for activities. I don\u2019t want them to go if they aren\u2019t completely done with their chores. My husband thinks I have too high of expectations and shouldn\u2019t care if for example a kid says they are done but didn\u2019t pick up dog poop. I think this teaches them to not be responsible and also has future consequences that directly impact me like when kids are playing in the backyard and come running in with dog poop stuck in their shoes that I now have to clean.  This is a reoccurring conflict in our marriage that I want the house to get straightened up at certain points throughout the day because it makes my job as a homeschooling stay at home mom easier to monitor for safety if things don\u2019t spiral out of control.

He made a card with the information on it. I\u2019m not sure when I saw it. He had been unreliable in the past. I wrote said gift card number down to verify the amount was correct.  Jump to last feb. I found the handwritten numbers and thought they were a gift card of mine since it was just jumbled into my stack of cards. My dad has been to this place many times since the gift was given. I never asked if he used it. I put it in, it worked! And, it was a lot! I used some of the funds to help my friend at the same time. I honestly didn\u2019t remember his card existed in that moment. I enjoyed what was purchased and kept living.  My dad went to use the gift card this year. \u201cArchived/unaccepted\u201d My brother does the due diligence and finds it\u2019s been used and the dates correlated with my activity.  He confronts me and says I am a thief and evil. I tell both of them I am sorry, I definitely used it, I didn\u2019t realize it at the time and I would pay my dad back immediately, dad says not now. This isn\u2019t good enough for my brother. He won\u2019t speak to me and had a full blown meltdown (manic depressive).  So, aita? My dad agreed to let me buy him another one or simply go with him next time he wants to make a purchase there but my brother won\u2019t accept that deal. He finally texted me today saying he has nothing to say to me until I admit guilt (I admitted I did it, just not maliciously) and that he won\u2019t talk until the card is replaced (dad said absolutely not and it\u2019s his card and he will let me know when he wants it replaced\u2026 idk why but after the last text I told him if it helps my relationship with my brother I am happy to go ahead and get the purchase taken care of).

We have better relation, we TALK and we\u2019re seeing each other at least once in a month. She\u2019s very helpful with the wedding stuff and she\u2019s helping me choose the dress.  I know she\u2019s a she, so we will have two bridesmaids, but it\u2019s lesbian wedding so it doesn\u2019t have to be traditional.  Should I do it? How can I tell him that without ruining our relationship? Please help \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc EDIT:  didn\u2019t write it, but I tried to reach out and we\u2019ve seen this couple months ago because of my idea. I understand that he\u2019s depressed and even tried to talk with him about it, but since the meeting he\u2019s been invited to couple meetings and didn\u2019t attend nor give the info. EDIT2: Where have I said that I\u2019m dropping him? He\u2019s my friend, if he needs some time to get better - okay, if it\u2019s too much for him rn - okay, I\u2019ll still be there for him, but he just won\u2019t be the bestman.",

She asked if she could have some friends over tonight to celebrate. I made food and cake for them. When she got home from school, I surprised her with everything I prepared, gave her some small gifts, and specifically asked if we will be lighting the candles on the cake together with her friends. She said yes. Her friends come to celebrate. She immediately sends her little sister (11F) to her/my room, as she wants the living room for herself. 3 hours go by, no cake is being cut. Her sister is upset (telling me, as she is not allowed in the living room) she is really waiting for the cake. I say this to my daughter. Half an hour later, her and her friend are singing happy bday, she blew out the candles, they cut the cake. (Not even the one I made - her friend brought another one). She doesn't call me or her sister. She doesn't offer me a piece of the cake. She completely ignores me (I am in my room).WIBTH if I told her ***tomorrow*** she was extremely rude for leaving me and her sister out of the celebration? When we thought we would be included, at least in this small part of it? BTW- she is planning a bigger party to celebrate in a couple of weeks, and she asked if we could let her have the house and go to my parents - and I said yes, as she is a very good kid, I trust her and I don't mind her having a party without her family. I am just really upset she didn't include us in this case, without letting us know in advance.",

After a week she moved back to her apartment with her brother because of the compute. They had a roommate that's lease ended on 1 Jan and I moved in with her. Her brother and her own the apartment, but since his company said he has to be back at the office one week a month, he has been traveling from his home city to stay in the apartment.  It's a two bed one bath. The first weeks weeks we were together was great. First time we have gotten to live together just us as a married couple. Then her brother came over. He's a decent guy and I like him. He's also an actuary and doing fine.  He and my wife (brother and sister) are best friends. They have an incredible relationship. Two nights ago in bed she told me he will be staying two weeks a month till August when he saves up enough to buy another place. I told her that we (34M, 32F) have not gotten any time to be married couple and she wants  a baby so when the baby comes (hopefully later this year) we will have never had any time to just be us as a couple, develop that relationship.  First thing the next morning she told him and he wanted to move out. She was depressed the whole day. That night I sat us all down at the dinner table and said we need to talk to each other. I explained myself again that we never got time to be a couple and he agreed. I invited him to stay as long as he wanted. My wife was happy and he said he would rather move to his own place and grow to our full couple potential everyone agreed. The next night my wife and I were at the mall shopping for a potato ricer so I could make us all gnocchi. When he called and we had to rush him to the hospital because, well no one told me why. When we got back to the appartment to fetch him he has a runny nose but they decided he could drive his own car and she would go with him. I stayed as I has a late night work commitment (IT deployment) They went, the doctor put him on a drip and they came back with some over the counter flu meds. That was yesterday. Today I joked that he could rent a place that my wife and I are looking to buy as a investment property. It's a joke because none of us can afford to live there if it wasn't paying for itself as an investment.  The both took that extremely seriously and my wife said that I made him feel unwelcome in the apartment. Am I the asshole?  Edit: my wife and I rent the apartment from her and her brother at full market value.  He moved in because his work from home policy changed. When I agreed to move here and away from my place outside the city, it was just my wife and I renting the apartment. So that she and he would not have to go through the trouble of finding a tenant to take over.",

        "selftext": "Alright, Reddit, I really need your input because I\u2019m seriously starting to lose it. I (25 M) am a graduate student in CompSci in Florida, living with my two boyfriends, one is 25 and the other is 23. We\u2019re all just barely scraping by. We all graduated undergrad in CompSci, and now we\u2019re doing our Masters, hoping that maybe\u2014just maybe\u2014things will get better. But here\u2019s the thing: the job market for CompSci is absolutely DEAD. I\u2019ve applied everywhere\u2014Starbucks, Chick-Fil-A, McDonald\u2019s, Walmart, Publix\u2014hell, I\u2019ve even tried random fast food chains and retail jobs\u2014and nothing. No openings. I\u2019m so broke, I\u2019m working DoorDash, Uber, Lyft, and doing random odd jobs just to pay bills and buy food. To make matters worse, we\u2019re stuck with this shitty condo we bought five years ago when we thought life would be easier (spoiler alert: it\u2019s not). Now, we\u2019re drowning in mortgage payments, so we decided to rent out our 3-bedroom, 1-bath condo for a decent price, hoping to get some help covering the bills. Me and my boyfriends are planning to move in with the 23-year-old\u2019s parents, and we\u2019re going to share one room to save money (because who wouldn\u2019t want to live like that?). So, these three college students came by for a tour. They barely showed any interest in the place, which was whatever, but then as they left, they just stood outside and started talking about how awful the place was. Like, LOUDLY. They could\u2019ve been a little more discreet, but nope, they just tore into it. And you know what? That was the final straw for me. I\u2019ve been struggling, stressed to the max, just trying to get through school, hoping that maybe\u2014just maybe\u2014I\u2019ll be able to land a job someday (but with how things are going, who the hell knows?). I\u2019m sick of it. So I walked outside and, yes, I fucking screamed at them about how hard it is to be a college student in this economy, especially a CompSci major with no job prospects. I ranted about how I\u2019ve applied to every damn job and can\u2019t get hired anywhere, how I\u2019m doing everything I can just to survive, and how even with a Masters, I don\u2019t know if anything will actually change. I may have used some\u2026 colorful language. Now I\u2019ve got a warning from my condo\u2019s HOA, saying if I do something like that again, I\u2019ll get a $450 fine. Seriously. They want me to just sit back and take it, while I\u2019m drowning in debt and frustration? I\u2019m just tired of pretending everything\u2019s fine when it\u2019s not. So, AITA for losing it and screaming at them? I get that I shouldn\u2019t have gone off like that, but can you blame me? Everything feels like it\u2019s falling apart, and I\u2019m just trying to survive.",

I am having a private ceremony (traditional reception immediately after) with only immediate family for my wedding and we are not having bridesmaids/groomsmen. My parents died when I was 16 and my siblings were all young adults, so they're all I have for immediate family. I have 3 sisters who I sent Pinterest photos to and shared my vision for the ceremony in terms of how I'd like their dresses with go with the color scheme, mostly so that family photos will turn out nice and nobody is harshly clashing. Long story short, they're all looking at above the knee summer dresses that are way more casual than I was hoping and also only seem to be looking at cheap Amazon dresses. My middle sister continuously makes jokes about my wedding.(This middle sister also happens to be one who eloped for her second wedding and didn't tell me until after it happened, yet when I announced my engagement said I better be maid of honor) I finally said something to them and asked why they didn't seem to be taking thingS seriously. Were they mad they weren't bridesmaids? I also asked what they had against longer dresses, as I think they look classier, and my oldest sister finally told me You can't expect us to dress so specifically if we're not part of a wedding party. You don't get to have those expectations This is the only thing I've asked of them that leans towards more of a wedding party task I guess. I haven't asked them to throw any pre-wedding parties, haven't asked them to help decorate or anything, and I had even planned a sisters weekend bachelorette party for us. AITA?",

        "selftext": "Involves myself (30F), my sister (twin) and our mom tangentially. Saturday evening was a common friend's engagement and only I attended, as sis lives out of country. My parents are away, time zones make our days/nights flipped (sis and I live in the same TZ). After the party around 1AM, I call the family chat and mom and sis picked up - I called to debrief on the engagement. Mom mentioned that our cousin was sick and that her dad went to a party alone (family birthday, which I knew about). She mentioned the party was the day before and I fixated on that - we had a quick back and forth about the date of the party - \u00a0this convo was 2 mins max, being very generous. \u00a0Sis apparently asked 4 times, what party? When mom and I finished the convo, I immediately answered sis and that's when I realized she'd disconnected. I thought maybe her phone died/Internet issue and continued talking to mom about the engagement because I figured I'd talk to my sis during the day, but wasn't sure when I'd speak to mom again. I even messaged right away asking what was wrong and why she wasn't on the call. But like I said, I thought it wasn't intentional and it's late, so whatever. I call my sis later on Sunday in the PM and ask what happened. Paraphrasing here, but the gist is, she said she didn't have to waste her time on the call when people are ignoring her and that it was extremely rude to not answer her when she asked four times and she was tired of being made insignificant. I got upset because if she had waited another minute, I would have answered. Sis said I should have answered immediately - that in the back and forth, one of us could have responded. I asked what was wrong with us finishing this minor thread before responding. There was a fight and we didn't talk. Today, I call sis again because I know she would be interested in the gossip and there were some things I wanted to run by her. However, I was still really frustrated by everything and after a little chit chat, I started the topic by mentioning along the lines that if my sist had been a little patient, I wouldn't have to go over this again. She blew up at me that she was tired of feeling insignificant and having her questions ignored. I responded again that 2 mins is not that long of a time and it just devolved again - I said something like it's a waste of time to repeat an hour long convo for this reason and she twisted it into I'm saying it's a waste of time talking to her. But then, I'm thinking, well, you thought it was a waste of your time to wait for 2 minutes, so why can't I think it's a waste to spend an hour rehashing everything? I get having to repeat convos/stories separately with my mom and my sis, but that's normally because one person wasn't available. But in this case, she was on the call and I feel this was a really petty reason to hang up. So, AITA because I did not immediately answer my sister's question instead of at the end of a conversation thread that lasted max 2 minutes?",

        "selftext": "New account because I'm pretty sure my step dad is chronically on reddit. I (17 F) have a cat named Fluff and have had him for at least three-four years. He was originally a feral the neighbors had picked up from the road; never took care of him and me and him eventually bonded so he chooses me over anyone else, even after we moved to our new house around last June. (This is important for later) Along with Fluff, we had another cat who passed, named Lynx. He was also from the neighbors. On day one of begging to bring my cats to the new house (they were going to ditch them and leave them to be neglected) my step father (36 M) said they were **my cats** and they'd be my responsibility. They paid for their food only (i paid for vet visits, even when i didn't have enough money to buy my own stuff); i paid to put Lynx down and cremated after he got sick since i didnt have enough money to give him the proper treatment for maggots and didn't want him to suffer. I just recently bought Fluff a tracking collar and a carrier, explaining to my step father (lets call him Jack for jackass) when he asked that I would be taking my cat with me to college. He got angry and berated me for a while, saying what he says goes and that Fluff would be unhappy with me and that I'd go nowhere in life. In the midst of his desperation, he even offered to buy me a kitten and to pay for the shots.  The problem is, I don't want to replace Fluff with a new kitten, and he doesn't see that. Jack hardly even looks at my cat (which, btw, hes saying its HIS cat now) and I'm scared that when I leave he's going to be neglected again. Fluff has gone through a lot for a 5 year old (roughly around) cat already, and I don't want him to be scared of being around the house again (hes an outside cat since he was a feral; ive been training him and he does well. Jack left him out during the harsh winter storm we had a bit back.) I'd have a dorm and I could legally register him as my emotional support animal; and this would all be in another year or so after i try to get income to save.

I hate living here. I have to share a room with their 6 year old because they only have 3 bedrooms and they won\u2019t put her in their room or with her brothers. Their cars are way too small for 6 people (one only seats 5 and one is a truck with 3 seats in front and 3 in back and I always have to sit in the front middle seat in the truck because all of the kids need booster seats or car seats). They make me babysit their kids twice a week just for some of the money they get for me and the food situation sucks. I\u2019ve been here for 4 months and we haven\u2019t gone to a real restaurant once, unless you count the trip to Applebees for their son\u2019s birthday. I can\u2019t even leave campus for lunch even tho my school is open campus unless I pay for my own food.  We also argue all the time because I have way more chores than their kids and my allowance isn\u2019t enough to do shit. They\u2019re even making me get a job so when I get a car I can pay them back. And the cars they want me to get suck! They\u2019re all older than me.  We got into another argument yesterday because I refused to participate in their little weekly \u201ctradition\u201d. Every Thursday they go grocery shopping at Costco then after grocery shopping they go to the food court and everyone gets hot dogs, pizza, and ice cream. I told her Costco nights suck and if they want to go out to eat they should at least take us to a real restaurant but she said the only way they\u2019re skipping Costco nights is if I figure out another way for the entire family to eat with drinks and dessert for less than $20 without her having to cook or clean up. That budget is impossible so I decided to stay home and use the emergency card they gave me to DoorDash some real food. They saw the charge that night and took the money out of my bank account to pay them back. I told them this is bullshit and it\u2019s their job to take care of me. She told me if I don\u2019t think they\u2019re taking care of me I should go to a real foster home and see how they treat me. We haven\u2019t talked since and she didn\u2019t even pack my lunch this morning so I\u2019m stuck getting school lunch (which tastes like shit) just because she\u2019s being petty. I tried telling my school counselor about this and he\u2019s usually pretty chill but he said I was acting a bit spoiled and I should\u2019ve gotten a hot dog or made myself a sandwich and sucked it up until I can go home or move out.

        "selftext": "For context, I have been with my girlfriend for 11 years and I turned vegan 3 years ago for ethical reasons. Before that, I was not eating a lot of meat, but I knew that I was not really doing the best thing (ethically). I was not vegan because I did not want to create any friction with family, friends, etc. but at some point, I decided to go vegan. For me, it doesn't make sense to kill/harm animals when I can just buy a can of chickpeas or buy some tofu instead. My girlfriend understands this and stayed omnivore, because she doesn't want to give up on things that she loves to eat. We live together so, me switching up to veganism obviously impacted her since we cook together only vegan/vegan adaptable meals. She sometimes buys cheese, milk, chicken and fish that she cooks for herself. Other than being vegan, I have a full time job and have many hobbies that take a lot of my time (competing in Ironmans, learning multiple languages, etc), so it is a struggle to spend a lot of good quality time with my girlfriend. Anyway, on her birthday, I came late from work and I went to a restaurant where they make some Poke bowls. I wanted to make her happy and knew that if she was with me, she would order the salmon poke bowl, but I ended up ordering a vegan Poke bowl anyway, because I did not think her birthday would justify me spending money on an industry that I really don't want to encourage. I felt that even tough it would no be her choice, it would still be a nice gesture. When I came back home with the vegan poke bowls, she was disappointed and kind of angry at me because she knew exactly what went in my head when I bought the bows. She felt that even on her birthday, I could not do any compromise and think solely about what she wanted. She says that even when I give something to somebody else, I don't put myself purely in their heads and that I always filter my actions based on MY standards. What do you think ? Edit : Thank you for all your comments. I am a selfish a*hole and definitely have to work on being a better boyfriend and a better person in general. My girlfriend is a wonderful person and I mistreated her. I will put myself more in her shoes next time I want to treat her and put myself and my standards out of the way. ",

        "selftext": "AITA? Like the title says, my Fianc\u00e9 is currently not speaking to me because I picked up a second job. I am currently a high school teacher who moved grades, so that means I am learning a new curriculum and working longer hours. Often, I am not getting home until 5:30-6:00 at night. My Fianc\u00e9 usually arrives home between 4-5pm. I was previously coaching esports so that meant some nights it was 6:30-7pm that I was arriving home. Now where we get to the problem, I am a total nerd and love to fly drones. I got offered the opportunity to fly a very expensive drone to film the football team. I was asked to film practices once a week and game nights. Due to my coaching responsibilities, I would have had to work game nights anyways, so I didn\u2019t think one extra day would be a huge deal. I underestimated how much time it would take out of my day and jumped on the opportunity. I did not speak with my Fianc\u00e9 first, and he was understandably upset. We had a fight and I fully took responsibility for not discussing it with him before I agreed to the position.  The athletic department was impressed enough by my work to replace me at esports (at my request in order to give me more time at home) and offer to pay me to exclusively fly the drone the second half of the year. They also want me to do it next year and have offered to double the percentage I was receiving for coaching esports. I have been ecstatic! I\u2019ve been telling everyone about it because I am so excited to be paid more for something I love. They do want me to film some of all of the major sports, but I do not have to do every game. Maybe a 1-2 times a week requirement of my time, but they are late nights. AITA for doing something I love 1-2 days a week on top of an already busy schedule?  Edit to clarify: My Fianc\u00e9 believes that I purposely misled him about which sports I would be filming. He was under the impression that I would only be filming football. I am confused about this because football is not year round. I don\u2019t know if I specifically told him I\u2019d be filming all major sports. I do remember discussing giving up esports to film exclusively year round. I remember discussing what I should request for my filming percentage. And before this argument happened, I filmed a soccer game to get a feel for filming the sport, and sent him selfies of me working the game. He said that he is \u201cdrifting away from me and no longer feels connected to me\u201d due to my work schedule.",

        "selftext": "I (19F) have been living with my roommate (18F) since the beginning of the Fall semester. In the first few weeks, things were fine, but over time, we became distant and passive-aggressive about our shared space. I have acute migraines and need the room pitch black to sleep, as any light triggers migraines. I\u2019ve talked to my roommate multiple times about this, and while she seemed to understand, lights continued to be left on, including her extremely bright alarm clock. I tried to handle it and sleep with some lights on, but she then brought in a new light that illuminated the whole room in purple, adding to the already bright alarm clock. One night, I tried to wake her up to talk about it, but she was asleep, and I couldn\u2019t turn the light off. After waiting a couple of hours for it to turn off on its own (it didn\u2019t), I unplugged it. I planned to talk to her about it in the morning, but when I woke up, she had left for class and left a note saying I needed to stop touching her stuff, and that the light would have turned off on its own. I didn\u2019t think much of it and decided to discuss it with her later. When she came back, she immediately started complaining about me touching her things, saying she likes having a light in the room, and that she\u2019s had to compromise on everything. She mentioned how she likes keeping the window open at night, and I always close it because I\u2019m afraid of break-ins. She also mentioned hating my curtain that blocks sunlight (the one she said I could have), and how I turn off her fairy lights at night, which I did to reduce light when she was asleep. She argued that the new light wasn\u2019t facing me, so it shouldn\u2019t be an issue, but it was still bright enough to illuminate the whole room. I tried to explain that this wasn\u2019t just about comfort\u2014it\u2019s a medical issue for me, and the lack of sleep is affecting my migraines and school performance. She didn\u2019t seem to understand and kept insisting that I need to compromise now. I understand she feels like I\u2019m not letting her use her lights, but my sleep is being severely impacted, and I\u2019m struggling with migraines and poor mental health because of it. So, AITA for turning off her lights so I can sleep?",

My husband thought it would be more fun if we had them over at the same time as the game. He invited them without asking me.  Living so far from my side of the family always makes me homesick on game day. Watching it with people who think sports are dumb makes it even harder. Still, I hear you all and have told them to stay for the whole game, and who knows maybe we'll all have more fun than we expected.  Edited: They bought in hard. Great Game. Great company.

She is fine with certain jokes when she makes them but has weird conditions - for example, she's fine with calling me stupid and vice versa, but my calling her a loser as nothing but a joke was too much.

        "selftext": "This is a theme in my relationship: I\u2019ll be doing something in a flow state and then my partner jolts me out of it.  Today, for example I was drumming - eyes shut, in a groove with my little steel hand drum on the kitchen table. My partner, who has been working in the yard comes inside. I hear the door open and shut and I\u2019m in such a sweet groove I decide to keep it going thinking he\u2019ll enjoy it. He comes over and caresses my butt, throwing me right off. I say: damn and sigh. Then I go lie down because I was heading for a nap when I saw the drum.  Two hours later I wake up to a temper tantrum from him, saying there\u2019s too many rules about when he can or can\u2019t interact with me. I say: it\u2019s basic respect not to interrupt.  Another example: I\u2019ve been working through The Artist\u2019s Way book, which is about helping you recover your creativity. One of the tools they suggest you do every morning shortly after waking up is write three pages longhand.  So I get up after a cuddle and go into another room and start writing. I\u2019m right in the flow and he comes in wanting to know something  (don\u2019t remember what but it wasn\u2019t urgent).  I give him the answer and tell him I prefer not to be interrupted when I\u2019m writing and that also ends up with him raising his voice and basically ranting.  Example 3: I\u2019m in my home office, with big chunky headphones on, eyes closed and meditating, and he pats me on the knee to tell me something. That time I got mad and said: I\u2019m meditating can\u2019t you see? He thinks I\u2019m being disrespectful because I didn\u2019t greet him as he came in the door. I think he\u2019s being disrespectful because he interrupts me.  Help, please. AITA? \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014- Edit to add a few random answers to questions: We are both at home, all the time. I\u2019m happy to see him, and responsive all the other minutes of all the other days.  I would love to meditate for 10 - 20 mins every day but right now I hardly do at all because it\u2019s hard to meditate while tracking his movements so I won\u2019t be startled if he interrupts me. I\u2019d also like to write for 20 mins every day and at the moment I\u2019m doing that but floating along on the surface of things and staying available and aware of him - it\u2019s not my best writing though because of that. I drum once in a blue moon for a couple of minutes.  These may sound like trivial occurrences, but they are just the latest in the pattern. When I was working from home as a coder he would also get upset if I told him I couldn\u2019t talk right now because I was working out a complex problem and would lose my way.  He also objects to closed doors. And I\u2019ve tried big chunky headphones as the visual signal. Steel hand drums are not imaginary \ud83e\udd28 They make a lovely melodic sound.  We had a difficult chat yesterday about this and now I realise, as one commenter said below, that he has never experienced a flow state or even an active listening-to-intuition state. So has no idea where I\u2019m coming from.  ",

My roommate is irritated with all the clicking and has asked me multiple times to just not play the games while she is in the room. Now I have made accommodations for her, like not playing games while she is doing schoolwork, not being on the phone while she is doing schoolwork, bought new headphones so I could speak quieter at night while on Discord with my buddies.  She still calls me inconsiderate and selfish for not ceasing the clicking while she is in the room because it bothers her and is super grating to hear She confronted me about it today and we got into an 'argument', but I told her I would not stop because I enjoy playing games. Some things that I do that I know are bad habits though, is I will lose track of time and stay up pretty late (12am EST at the latest) but I am not super loud, or yelling or anything past dark I have some screenshots that I am willing to share if I can  UPDATE: We have both said our arguments and apologized for our harsh words. We have come up with a compromise, we will keep our no games while studying and add on so that after 10-ish pm, I will not play the clicky games such as Rivals, League or Monster Hunter. We have also decided that if something else comes up, we will discuss it there and then instead of letting it fester and becoming a problem.

Now, for context, I am a female, and my business name is a punny version of my name and the murderer combined. I've never had an issue with it before, and have even received compliments on the creativity of it in the realm of work I do.  Recently I was told that the name associated with my business may come off to certain people as intimating or flat out insensitive. I obviously asked for them to elaborate, and they believed that because a large percent of my clientele are women, they would be scared to contact me or the business due to the fact that I named myself after a person that murdered women in the 1800s. Of course, this was not my intention. But now I'm being interrogated by someone very close to me as to why I chose this name in the first place. The words immature and hypocritical were brought up, and even a reference to an old middle school email you regret but can't change. But I have built my whole career off of this name, and carry myself in a very professional and friendly way. Either online or in person. I also feel I am pretty successful in my business as well and recieve amazing reviews about my personality and bedside manner.  I'm just saddened to hear that someone I care about claimed some pretty bold assumptions of me being sexist or insensitive to women, and flat out don't care about women being murdered even in present day. Which is definitely not the case. I honestly understand the history, and the connotation, but am I really the asshole? ",

There has been lots of issues and for the longest time I\u2019ve said I will break up with him. We have been together for 4 years, so I have sort of created the problem I am in now. We spent Christmas and new years apart as I really don\u2019t get along with his family. Because of our jobs we are also currently living about 4 hours away so just this week I finally got to see him, I went over to his.  My parents had picked up on the time that my bf has spent here where I live, that I tend to pay for most things, and although we aim to do 50-50 split, for the most part he was earning about 2x than what I make and we still even split but I\u2019d end up paying for most things when we are out.  So my parents are concerned about this, I don\u2019t know what to do because I\u2019m very attached but here is where I might be the asshole: I showed my mom some jewellerymy partner gave me for Christmas. This was after about 3 years of hints as he never spent more than \u00a340 on gifts but spends lots on booze and again the gifts I gave him were far far more than what he spent on me.  My mom started making fun of the jewlerry, pointing out it was a fake. She also pointed out how my brother was about to get me the same jewellery over Christmas as it was on 50% sale. She also mentioned how much of a cheap ass he was, and how naive I was too take the jewellery. I didn\u2019t actually know if it was fake or not I was pleased he got me something other than candles. Even tho I agree a bit with her I snapped and told her she was a horrible person and that she had raised me to be like this so she should stop asking the world to treat me like a princess when she treats me like shit (her main argument is that I deserve more attention and thoughtfulness from a bf).The conversation obviously escalated and we both said some nasty things, I particularly said \u201cright cause your life is so hard we all have to be miserable with you?\u201d Bc my mom is going through a particularly rough job situation and I also said \u201cmaybe if you treated me better I would think I deserve more\u201d this is coming of the backend of my mom always been very a volatile parent. I also said I hated her and that she was just like her mom, and she was probably end up on her own as she pushes everyone away. I\u2019m not proud of what I said but writing it out so I\u2019m honest about the situation. She apologised profusely after it but I\u2019m very butt hurt about the whole situation.  TLDR: SO am I the asshole for going psycho on my mom for making fun of my boyfriend\u2019s present to me?",

        "selftext": "I (31f) recently drifted away from a friend (25f). I thought this happened naturally, (not hanging out as much / not talking over instagram etc.) but she felt hurt by the distance. We \u201cbroke up\u201d over text after the she sent l an incredibly long \u201cwhat did I do?\u201d to which I responded in summary \u201cnothing really, I feel like we\u2019re just in different parts of life. I wish you the best though!\u201d I realize now this text was the opportunity she wanted to launch into a diatribe of all the things I did wrong in the relationship and that she felt offended by. I had NO idea. One of these things was a miscommunication about driving to the airport. (A year and a half ago!) She messaged me in August 2023 about driving her to the airport at 6 in September. I said sure, even though this is something that I would not normally ask of a friend (I would ask my mom for or get an uber. Gas is expensive!) but I thought \u201cwell, she doesn\u2019t have a lot of family here\u201d so I said sure, you can get me a coffee and we\u2019ll call it even. I\u2019m a morning person so I figured she was asking me to drive her at 6 am. If I had known she meant 6pm I would have not agreed in the first place.  So flight day arrives and I roll up to her place at 6. I call her. Dial tone. Finally I get a hold of her and she says that the flight was at 6pm. We both apologized for the misunderstanding. I go back home to bed. I get up for work and am feeling (understandably?) tired and a bit grumpy. I send her a text saying \u201chey, I\u2019m not upset at you, but I am a bit grumpy about this miscommunication and am going to have to politely decline to drive you at 6pm tonight to rest\u201d I gave her notice and she replied \u201ctotally fair, I\u2019m so sorry for the mix up!\u201d and she sent me a starbucks giftcard for my trouble, which was a sweet but totally unnecessary gesture. She got to the airport, I wished her a nice vacation, and we caught up when she got back. I thought all was well.  Folks, all was not well. She had apparently held on to this resentment as \u201cI broke a promise\u201d to her. She said me cancelling was selfish cause she couldn\u2019t afford an uber and was shocked that I didn\u2019t rearrange my schedule to drive her at 6pm. She apparently had to take a bus and then get another friend to drive her \u201cwho dropped everything for her\u201d. She was flabbergasted that she \u201csent me the giftcard and then I cancelled! WHO DOES THAT?!\u201d Apparently I didn\u2019t prioritize her and didn\u2019t care about her feelings and wellbeing as I knew how much this trip meant to her. I looked back and she sent me the giftcard after I declined to drive her. I thought it was a nice gesture at the time, but now I feel like she felt like I owed it to her to say \u201caww, since you got me coffee I WILL drive you now\u201d. I thought this was a simple favour that I could revoke cause circumstances changed and not \u201ca promise\u201d. I am doubly confused cause she said over text that it was fine at the time. Am I the asshole for not realizing this was a dealbreaker? ",

I know C didn't care about me telling him.

If I had told him something that was a secret, obviously he couldn't keep one. That's it, that's all. **  I'm so worked up. So help me reddit, AITA?  In this scenario there are 3 sets of male/female couples, who are good friends. Couples consist of me and my boyfriend, C+J, and S+S Lately the 2 other females in this friend group have been getting into it. C confided in me about their argument, and I told my boyfriend about it tonight while we were hanging out. Before I even told him anything, I literally started by saying Do. Not. Repeat. This  Well I left his place and he was already messaging C about it by the time I got home. He brought the very thing I said do not repeat to, up, not even 20 minutes after I left. Now, C doesn't care I'm sure, but my boyfriends obviously clueless what do not repeat means. He kept saying C was fine with it, and he thought I meant do not repeat this to S+S..  So after I was flabbergasted he brought it up, he really gave me a half ass apology and was saying things like Considering we're in a relationship she'd  know you would tell me, and that I'm being juvenile, and the whole thing is crazy, I'm making a way bigger deal out of it then I should be and how C didn't say I couldn't tell him so therefore it doesn't matter.   Honestly I kept saying this wasn't about C, it's the principle of me literally asking him not to repeat it, him saying he understood and then going and doing the exact same thing I asked him not to. He doesn't get it. I didn't realize I had to say every person's name for something to not be repeated.  If I'm in the wrong for making a big deal about this, I'd love to know.. AITA?? ",

        "selftext": "Today, after going to the gym, my parents and I had an appointment with a math tutor to see if I was eligible and what I could gain. My grades aren't awful (B\u2019s-C\u2019s), but I don\u2019t understand a lot of the fundamentals and I do terribly on tests. I\u2019m in geometry, which is normal for my age.  My dad (58M) dropped me off at the appointment, and after I finished a test to assess my math skills, I was bored and decided to go get food. I couldn\u2019t find a place to sit, so I texted my mom (51F)to complain a bit, mostly just because I wanted to talk to her. When my parents came back, I called my dad to find him, and when I finally did, I was upset because he told me there *was* seating in Fry\u2019s (my mom must\u2019ve told him about the texts). I had just walked around for 10 minutes trying to find a seat, so I didn\u2019t believe him and was frustrated. We started arguing, and my mom shut it down saying, Why are we arguing over bullshit? I felt embarrassed because there were little kids around, and I was still upset. After we met with the tutor inside and we were walking out I told them the tutoring might not work (I know, I was being stupid) On the drive home, I was venting to my mom (I usually talk to her about my dad), but then she started screaming at me. She called me a bunch of names cunt,bitch,disgusting and a narcissist and ungrateful for everything they do for me. I tried to explain that I was just nervous about the tutoring situation, but she kept berating me. She complained about being busy, driving me around for things like swimming practice, a sport I don\u2019t enjoy or want to do. I find it hard to feel sorry for her when a lot of the stress is self-inflicted. She is also choosing to have two jobs and keeps saying she has no time for herself (my dad makes enough for my family to live comfortably and her income is not much, but we respect it because she \u201clikes to be busy\u201d she says) At one point, I snapped and called her childish and narcissistic, and she flipped out even more. When we got home, I felt a bit bad, so I apologized to my dad and thanked him for signing me up for tutoring, even though he reassured me that he wasn\u2019t upset. Now I\u2019m feeling confused. I\u2019ve forgiven my mom for everything in the past, but it feels like she really hates me, and I don\u2019t know why. I\u2019m wondering if I was justified in calling her childish and narcissistic, or if I should have just let it go and kept my mouth shut.  AITA?",

He asks me if we would be able to share the machine and alternate between sets. I politely declined and had not specified any reasons as I did not want to come across as rude. He immediately asks how many sets I plan on doing to which I respond 6. He then says that I would be wasting his time if I didn\u2019t share with him and that I was selfish for not sharing.

It was her birthday a month ago however because she was on winter holiday her coworkers never congratulated her properly. Today they got her a large bouquet of flowers as a gift.

I'm a a high-school senior in my last year of IB. As she knows I have a lot of work with the program and college applications. I don't mind going to help her if there is an important matter, like if she forgot her nurse uniform, however for a matter as trivial as this I think there are other solutions that can be taken that don't require my help. It should be noted that we live in a N\u00feordic country which is currently receiving a lot of snow and under negative 10 degree Celsius weather. Getting ready to leave the house on top of the journey to and back seems pointless for a task that is relatively unnecessary. The flowers can be carried in 2 trips on different days as I repeatedly pointed out over the phone. Am I the asshole for not helping her?

Basically, me and my friends had been planning to go out to lunch during one of the weekends and we had been planning this for about two weeks. When the day rolls around, I ended having to be taken there by my grandma and at the time, my cousin was with my grandma also. I was running a bit late but while we\u2019re riding in the car, my grandma brings up that I\u2019m going out to eat and decides to ask me if my cousin can come, I ended up saying sure and gave my friends a heads up that my cousin was coming although there was a bit a protest from them, there was nothing I could do because I didn\u2019t wanna tell her no and my cousin doesn\u2019t really have a lot of friends and we have always bit sort of close. So we get to the restaurant and things go as they should, my cousin doesn\u2019t really talk to anyone besides me and isn\u2019t bothering anyone, she just eats and pays for her own food as everyone does. Today my friend text me telling me that he thought it was really weird that I invited my cousin to a gathering that was for friends and something we had been planning for a while. I blew this off because I didn\u2019t see it as that big a deal but he told me he was serious and asked why I would invite her, I told him that there was no harm in it and that she minded her own business the entire time. He protested and told me that wasn\u2019t the point and it was mainly the fact that I invited her without consulting anyone else and as I said before we were literally in the car on the way to the restaurant when \u201cI invited\u201d her. He then thought it would be good to say \u201cns idk why ur gma even let her go she knew it was like a friend thing\u201d and to me this sounded so stupid because my grandma obviously didn\u2019t see any harm in inviting her and was only trying to help my cousin out.

When she went to book us massages, the spa mentioned that they only service 18 and older fur full body massages. So aunt booked me a manicure, pedicure, and facial instead, while she and my mom got to have the whole works with a nice full body massage. Here\u2019s the thing, I\u2019ve had plenty of manicures and pedicures so getting them doesn\u2019t really feel very \u2018fancy spa like\u2019 or pampering. I asked my sing if she could just tell them I\u2019m 18 (since I have always been told I look a few years older) but she wouldn\u2019t.  We get to the spa and they immediately take my mom and aunt back but I had to wait almost an hour for my facial masseuse to come get me. The lady kind of rushed it, and was in a hurry to get me out of the room when she was done. The mani and pedi was nothing different from your typical nail salon visit. I then had to wait almost an hour afterward in the lobby for my mom and aunt bc they wanted to go swimming in the whirlpool and hot tubs. We went to lunch nearby afterward and my mom asked me why I was so grumpy and I said that no worries I wasn\u2019t. She then kept prying so I then broke it to her that it wasn\u2019t fair I didn\u2019t get nearly the same luxurious treatments they were bragging about on the way to lunch, just because I\u2019m younger. The mani and pedi didn\u2019t feel anything more luxurious than going to a nail salon. It also wasn\u2019t fair I had to wait over an hour in the lobby while they got to enjoy the amenities without inviting me down. My mom angrily snapped that I\u2019m also the only one if the three who doesn\u2019t work a full time job nor did I pay for any of it, and that one day when I start working and can afford it, then I can enjoy a nice treatment. She then revealed that my pedicure was $80, which I think is steep bc it was no better than a nail salon visit. My aunt didn\u2019t say anything, but WITA here? ",

I (19 M) was talking to my coworker (26 F) about how my ex stepdad/My brother's dad was supposed to help me move in one Friday (he offered because I was living with him), but when I called to ask him if he was ready and he was confused on what I was meaning and he didn't know we would be doing it so early in the day. (it was a little before noon but he was told a week before when and what day) He had to go to one of his younger kids school to have birthday lunch with her which was fine I said we could do it after, but his now girlfriend ( not my mom) said I was trying to ruin her daughters bday and I was an asshole and must of planned it. So he hung up called me back and asked if he could do it Saturday, but I had to stay at a family friends house to watch their dogs and so I said that was fine and I would send him a picture of how I wanted it since I couldn't be there to help him or do it myself. Well he had got there threw it in my room not at all how I sent him and my roomates family had to do it because they felt bad.  I was upset more because they had to do it and I didn't say anything to him about it and still thanked him for doing it... but my coworker said I was an asshole for trying to make him  set up my whole house and I was being entitled. I feel like considering I had it all planned for him but he forgot about it inconveniencing me and then I couldn't be there I was in my rights to be frustrated with him... So am I the Asshole?  edit-  I feel like people are coming at me because I started a fight with him or something but like the the oh post I thanked him for doing it and offered gas to which he said no to, I didn\u2019t argue with him about it but I feel I should still be able to be upset that he didn\u2019t do it when he said he would and told my roommate and her family he knew how I wanted it but didn\u2019t care to do and said I wouldn\u2019t mind in left.  obviously I do mind and he didn\u2019t put like pictures or thing small things like that for me up he just had to put a bed and my desk in there and that was it. I was unable to be there because he had forgot to plan accordingly which lapsed into my plans I had to watch a house which has been set in stone months in advanced thank you for ur comments! ",

        "selftext": "Hello all. This incident occurred last Tuesday, but I should first provide some background: I have a body odor problem, and have gotten teased at different points of my life. I often use a bottle of cologne (Azarro Sport) to override this when I venture out into the public.  I am a high school student, but frequently attend college lectures with the permission of the professor as I believe it to be one of the best ways to consistently strengthen my mathematical knowledge. I have time-to-time received hostile remarks for my displaced priorities, but never so many as I had this lecture. (...) At around 5:10 PM, before it began, I had received strange gestures from my peers. An individual I had known by proxy cringed at the smell only moments after I had arrived in the line to the lecture hall. Furthermore, I heard 5-10 utterings regarding a sharp smell. I sat at the corner of the lecture hall (not a particularly large room), where the individual I had sat beside gave me a dude what the fuck. All seats were occupied at this point, and those around me did not relocate or vacate the room. Me and several other suspects were hit with dirty looks from those in front of us, though I am observant enough to admit that the vast majority of those stares were directed towards me. By the time class had started I was super embarrassed, even debating whether to walk out. I ultimately remained, as the smell's absence along with mine would affirm my guilt.  ~20 minutes into the lecture the professor commented something like I will ask that next time we be more conscientious of perfume use and consider those around us. At this point the only redeeming factor of my ordeal was that only a *few* people around me were of the conviction that I was responsible for the smell, and not the entire class. After the 50 minutes of class time had elapsed, I was the last to leave and politely waved the professor I walked around the halls to test if the smell remained by observing the reactions of those around me. Fortunately no one seemed to take heed, allowing me to, ignorantly, proceed to another lecture (Lagrangian Mechanics) with the conviction that the smell had subsided. When I entered the classroom before just before it filled up I was confronted by a former student of my own school. I assumed that they had noticed the scent during the last lecture and identified me as the culprit, as I was told passionately to go home. At this point it was not worth staying to observe the lecture; I left with the same aura of embarrassment and called a taxi home (during which, there was no remark of a strong scent). Ultimately I did act inappropriately simply as a result of my inexperience with cologne. I had always been told that body odor was ignorant and inconsiderate of my peers, but my solution had turned out to be paradoxical. I learned my lesson and understand that I acted with ignorance, (...) but do my actions demonstrate a corrupt flaw that reflects a truly bad disposition? ",

        "selftext": "EDIT: Switched to a full fake name instead of just using a single letter. 27M - Hi everyone. Yesterday at noon, I dropped off clothes at a consignment store. They have a policy: If you don't pick up your items after we're done sorting through it, we will donate what's left and give you store credit. Now my plan was that, after work, I would drop my wife off at home, head back to the store to pick everything up, run some other errands, and then return home. All of that changed when a truck barreled down the highway, rear-ended us and sent our car spinning. My wife and I were fine, but the back of our car was totaled. I'm calling friends that can pick us up and give us a ride home, while my wife, who is a PhD student, is texting her friend at her lab to see if she can help us out - we'll call her Jane. While we're constantly shifting between the car to gather our belongings and talking to the cops, I've got my wife's phone in my hands and it rings - it's Jane. I pick up and she's asking about how we're doing. I tell her we're getting all the information written down. And then in a moment of instinct, I mention to her that I still have all my stuff at the store and that I need help picking it up. That's how my brain works. I noticed that we were handling all the other stuff pretty well so I thought of the next steps in my plan. As I'm mentioning this, my wife sees me talking, and so I went oh never mind, I'll figure it out on my own. and hang up, giving my wife back her phone. Fast forward to this morning, my wife is furious, telling me that both Jane and her boyfriend were mad at me for asking for help. She's telling me that I should never call Jane to get my stuff, saying that she is not my friend, that I didn't even tell her that I did that, when I didn't make the call. Previously a package got delivered to our front door and I asked if Jane could help push it into our garage. According to my wife, Jane gets mad at me for asking, but when I told her thank you in person, she would tell me it was no problem. The way I see it, Jane is always complaining if someone needs help from her, but she will constantly ask other people for help on tasks that she needs to do herself. Even my wife agrees with that. My wife constantly talks to me about how Jane has lab work that she's made her boyfriend do, to the point that the boyfriend has joked that he deserves half a Ph.D. for how much work he's accomplished. My wife has also been called in to help Jane with lab work. I've apologized to my wife about talking to Jane directly and again, I know that the request is something that is super petty especially regarding the circumstances - obviously thinking about the clothes is pointless especially if our lives were on the line, but I thought that after we're okay, our belongings are okay, we're safe - I feel like I can take a brief second to think about my tasks. It just feels like after a car crash my wife and I should be more loving to each other and this has thoroughly split us in a rough way. So Reddit, am I the asshole?",

        "selftext": "I 18F have two friends F18 & F19, we\u2019re in our last year of highschool and we\u2019re all in the same class. We\u2019ve been friends for 3 years while they have been for around 4 or 5 years.  A little info about out friendship: I\u2019m a person that BOLDY expresses my opinions without sugarcoating which cause me to often come over harsh but factual. I make this known among my friends. My two friends often choose to ignore truth and feed into their delusions mainly about ex boyfriends. They both support going back to old habits while im trying to pull them out. Also I often make jokes that are sarcastic, but my two friends sometimes can\u2019t tell when im joking or not. I keep reminding them im 99% just playing with them and that its a part of my personality.  The backstory is, I made a joke in class about F19 for wearing an off shoulder top in 1\u00b0C weather and said that we are not in Spain and she should put some clothes on or she\u2019ll freeze to death. For some reason this made my other friend F18 flip out on me saying that i always criticize F19 on things like her past relationships, what she does etc and that I should stop. I told her that if F19 had a problem with my joke or things that i criticize she should stand up for herself or atleast not yell at me like that. We we\u2019re going back and forth and basically just having a meaningless argument eventually the teacher stepped in and everything calmed down.  Now they\u2019ve decided to ignore me and not talk to me. When i tell one of my other friends what happened they say stuff like. 'Maybe you came over a little aggresive\u2019 because i am known to do so. Everytime something like this happens between me and one of them, they always choose eachothers sides. I\u2019ve decided that i\u2019d rather have no friends then people who constantly criticize my personality and don\u2019t choose me back.  Now im wondering if im the Asshole for constantly critizing my friend F19, i\u2019ll give you some examples: i\u2019ll say that she\u2019s dumb for going back to her ex that cheated on her, i\u2019ll say that she\u2019s na\u00efve and that she can\u2019t stand up for herself when people take advantage of her. Etc etc..  So im debating if instead of being a bold person that states her opinions, im just an actual asshole and need to be nicer? Edit: altough I criticize, i\u2019m just trying to protect them from getting hurt. I still love them even though it may not look like it. ",

Other than the odd disagreement we have coparented very well for quite a few years now. We have an agreement in place but it\u2019s flexible. We sit together at his sports, I go over there to play with him when it\u2019s not my designated time, we do holidays together, you get the idea. My son plays hockey and it\u2019s become his whole identity, it\u2019s all he wants to do ever. I grew up playing hockey and his mom is not sporty in the slightest, so it\u2019s something that him and I bond over and he is always asking for me to play with him. Thursday night after his practice he asked both his mom and I if I could come play with him in the basement after his game today (he has a set up in his basement at his moms with a full sized net and sheets of fake ice). We both have the okay and all was good. At the game today I told her that the outdoor rinks were finally good quality and ready (we are Canadian eh) so I was going to take him out to do that instead. She was fine with it, and he looked like a kid at Christmas when I told him. After his game we went straight there and played for 2 hours. He then told me he was hungry (after playing hockey for 3 hours straight no doubt). Important to note that this kid gives no warning, he goes from fine to starving in 3.2 seconds and has an utter meltdown like he hasn\u2019t eaten in 6 years every time. It\u2019s a known thing and a running joke between all friends and family. We were much closer to my place and I had not been given a time to have him home or mention of plans so we went back to my place to I could make him dinner quick before I took him back to his mom. I got a text from her as we were eating, she was planning on ordering them pizza and wanted to know how much longer we would be. When I told her we were eating already and I would drop him off soon she got extremely snippy with me, essentially telling me that I was stealing her time and that if I did that to her I would be pissed, it went on and on especially because I honestly can\u2019t figure out what the issue was. Should I have checked in and seen if she had plans? Maybe. Should she have said she had dinner plans for them? Also maybe. But she told me it wasn\u2019t about the food, it was about \u2018me stealing time from her\u2019. From the time we left his game to the time I dropped him off, fed, was less than 3 hours. Am I really the asshole here?",

And now my parents borrowed a suit from my cousin(from the other side of the family)\u2026 it\u2019s one of those suits with a vest, a white shirt, and a bow tie. I knew I wouldn\u2019t be able to get out of dressing up somehow, but I at least wanted a cool outfit like a black suit with a gray shirt or something. Definitely not a white shirt and absolutely no stupid bow tie. But my parents are saying that since I hate formal clothes anyway and won\u2019t wear them again before I outgrow them, they don\u2019t want to waste money. We had a fight about it, but no chance, I have to wear the full suit. I teased my cousin back then when he had to wear it. He hates formal clothes like me, and I made fun of him, said he looked like a choirboy in that outfit and that I would never let my parents force me to wear something like that, especially not a stupid bow tie. Now he\u2019s already super annoying because my parents borrowed his suit for me. I told him I\u2019d only wear it without the bow tie and without the vest. But I know he\u2019s gonna stalk my family\u2019s social media on Saturday, and if he sees a picture of me, I\u2019m done. He\u2019ll never let me live it down. He\u00b4s going to roast me for the next 10 years. My parents don\u2019t know that and I can\u2019t tell them, they are only getting annoyed with me. I told my parents that I just don\u2019t want to be in any photos at the wedding, but they say that would be rude and that I have to be in the photos.

        "selftext": "^(Not that I think it will get to this point, but please don\u2019t reshare this on TikTok or YouTube shorts. I know my coworker watches those types of videos.) My (23f) coworker (21f) Millie has a very sweet and loyal boyfriend (21m) Luke. I don\u2019t know Luke very well, but he always picks us up from our hangouts (we\u2019re practically neighbors) and we even went to watch Dune 2 together as a trio. I\u2019ve gotten pretty close with Millie, since she\u2019s not local here and the three of us have a nice synergy whenever he picks us up from hangouts. All in all, I have a really great impression of Luke and they\u2019re very much a serious couple. I have another coworker (21f) Jessa that I also get along with just fine. Jessa and Millie started at the same time, so they\u2019re pretty close. They hang out together on their spare time and seem to share a similar type of humor. I was working with Jessa the other day and just to make time pass, I was telling her a story about two mutual friends of mine fighting over a guy. I made a comment in the lines of I don\u2019t understand why pretty girls go after ugly guys and without missing a beat, Jessa turns to me and says Oh, like Luke. She changed the topic before I even got to respond and I a minute later I told her I had to go do some paperwork. In the office, I ended up calling my best friend (who doesn\u2019t know these people) because I was kind of shaken by Jessa\u2019s comment. I asked her if I was overreacting for finding it so disturbing, and she told me I was (I later had a longer talk where she saw where I was coming from and agreed with me that the comment was very weird). To give some extra context, Millie has told me that when she first started seeing Luke, her close friends back at home used to shit on his appearance and tell her she can do so much better. Luke is by no means ugly, but Millie is drop dead gorgeous. Once they started being serious, they backed off and haven\u2019t made any more comments on him, especially because he treats her so well. With this in mind, I just felt Jessa\u2019s comment was completely uncalled for. I don\u2019t want to overstep because I know what type of relationship Millie and Jessa have (outside of work), so I don\u2019t know if this is their type of banter (though I highly doubt it). I think if I were in Millie\u2019s shoes, I\u2019d want to know, but I also don\u2019t want to cause trouble at the workplace. I also don\u2019t know if Jessa knows how sensitive Millie is about those types of comments. Jessa did once say that Millie is her ideal type and I\u2019m kind of cursing myself for letting my mind wander to that territory. Am I overreacting? I just feel like saying this about someone\u2019s boyfriend is weird, but it\u2019s even weirder when it\u2019s a coworker? And should I tell Millie or just leave it be? Jessa has said and done some other stuff that has made me annoyed in the past, but this just takes the cake. I feel a moral obligation to tell her, but I also feel like I'll save everybody some grief if I keep it between me and Jessa.",

My bfs dad said it was very rude of me and my bf  to not put the booster seat back from where we moved it.  My bf is mad at me to because his dad lectured him about the importance of the booster seat and suggested he didn't care about his sister's safety at all, his sister overheard this and it really upset her, my bf wants to talk to her and tell her he loves her and cares very much about her safety but she won't let him in her room.

He and his ex gf had a terrible and long relationship (10 years), in which she was cruel to me and my mother. They broke up, she threw him out, she took him back. We took him into out home to get him clean, and she came and picked him up. He got DUI\u2019s, we left him in jail to detox, she bailed him out. She refused to quit drinking and enabled his alcohol issues. She said they were in love, and other times she said he was a \u2018homeless guy\u2019 that lived with her.  My brother came to my house under hospice care, and given the animosity, I asked her not to come to my home. She did tell him goodbye at the hospital, and then screamed at me and my mother over his hospital bed because she blamed us for his issues. After my brother passed, my mother had him cremated and kept all of his remains. Immediately after he passed, I updated the ex and asked if he had any belongings at her house (he had family heirlooms, tools from my deceased grandfather, etc.) She told us she had thrown away his things and anything he had left was hers, since she had bought it.  Every other month, she sends me drunk messages demanding ashes and insulting me when I say no. She has never once expressed sympathy towards me or my mother.  I am done with the messages.

        "selftext": " Me (26 yo female) and my boyfriend (24 yo male) have been dating for 5.5 years. We are currently on vacation in Hawaii and to save some money for excursions and food we decided to rent a car through a more budget friendly place. The first car we received had a cracked interior and scratches and bumps on the exterior but ran and worked so we didn\u2019t think too much of it.  But then we started to notice some sounds that made us concerned that the bearings could be messed up or who knows what. So we asked the rental car place about it and they gave us a different car. This car was similar condition but it has the check engine light on. As soon we we noticed that, my bf said it\u2019s fine and we shouldn\u2019t worry about it. But I was concerned and encouraged him to please ask the rental car guy. So he reluctantly did and apparently all the rental car guy said was \u201cit\u2019s fine, but if it starts blinking on and off there\u2019s an issue so call us\u201d. I personally don\u2019t feel comfortable renting a car with a check engine light on, I don\u2019t care that it is a discounted rental car place, that doesn\u2019t mean that you should accept a car that has a check engine light on. But my BF used to work in a car shop years ago and he isn\u2019t concerned. I know that the check engine light being on could mean a myriad of different things from things that aren\u2019t concerning to things that can be a safety hazard. Personally, I am worried that while we are driving in an area without service (there are a lot of them) or when we are driving on the road to Hana or some narrow winding single lane trail with cliff edges and no guardrails, something is going to go wrong. He doesn\u2019t seem to be concerned about it and I am encouraging him to please drive us back to the rental car place and ask for a car without a check engine light on. He told me if I want a different rental car, he\u2019s not coming and I will have to go 30-45 min back to the rental car place by myself once we get back (even though we will be close to the rental car place on our way back to where we are staying). I truly think it is rude how he is not taking my concern seriously and is unwilling to switch out for a different rental car or at least ask them and telling me I have to do it (he is the one who made the reservation). He thinks I\u2019m entitled and that I\u2019m just upset I\u2019m \u201cnot getting my way\u201d. Am I the asshole? UPDATE: just thought I would let everyone know that my boyfriend agreed to ask the owner if he knew why the check engine light was on and if they have a different car for us to use. We went and the owner said he does not know why, and offered another car with a check engine light on. We kept ours for another hour or so, during which the seals on the front doors loosened so there was wind loudly on each side, there became an identified issue with the shifter in which we could not switch from reverse to drive and slid backward for a moment into oncoming traffic, and the whole area on the driver side holding the lock/unlock and window clickers pulled off when my bf closed the door. We asked for a refund which the owner gave us and rented a jeep through budget car rental.\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc",

        "selftext": "I (F 28), and my finance (M 27) are getting married in April in Mexico. We planned a huge brunch for our friends to ask them to be a part of our wedding party back in March of 2024. Everyone of course said yes, however, as time went on, a groomsman needed to back out so we needed to backfill the position to make it equal for our wedding party to walk down the aisle. Of course, it didn't bother me that my brother-in-law was not initially asked because my finance does have a lot closer friends that he has been friends with for years and we hang out with every weekend. When going over who my fiance was going to add to his side of our wedding party, he mentioned asking another friend of his, I told him it should be my brother-in-law and not his old best friend. Some background, my fiance and my brother-in-law are pretty close, we see him and my sister quite often as my sister is one of my best friends, and our kids (6) are the same age and hang out all the time. This friend that my fiance wanted to add to his wedding party was a really good friend of ours when we first started dating, he and his now finance were some of our best friends that we hung out with every weekend, however, we stopped hanging out with them both for about two years as the friend would make comments about me being a stay at home mom and living off my finance. Me and my fiance both agreed that I would be a stay-at-home mom while I finished college. Fast forward to today, we reconnected with our friends and after a serious apology from my fiance's friend we started to become a part of each other's lives, We only see them maybe once or twice a month, so I was confused as to why my fiance would want him in our wedding over my brother-in-law. I understand that they were best friends for years, and this is his side of the wedding party but my brother-in-law has always been there for us and never has done us wrong. So am I the asshole for asking my fiance to have my brother-in-law over his old best friend?",

        "selftext": "I (28F) live with my boyfriend (28M). I work a state govt job that keeps me out late while his job in IT is flexible so he works from home sometimes. We have been dating for a couple years now and recently he moved in with me. I bought the house and pay the mortgage for it entirely. My BF does not pay me any rent since he is currently in a low paying job and actively looking for better options. However he also has the longer commute to work so he pays more for gas now ever since he moved in because previously he lived closer to his workplace. Until he finds a new job, he told me he unable to contribute for the mortgage and hasn't asked to be on the deed either. He does however pay half the utilities and half of the groceries too. He has been extra conscious about not contributing to the mortgage or paying any rent. Since he doesn't pay rent, he tries to make up for it by doing almost all of the cooking for both of us. He also does the laundry and dishes most of the times without complaint. And when I ask him for help cleaning the house like mopping the floors, he helps with that too. He also packs my lunch every morning to save me the trouble of getting up early. I am really lucky that he does all of this. However, he does make a mess (kitchen and bathroom) and his cleaning isn't as good as when I would do it. We also buy a lot of groceries which we have nowhere to put since the house is somewhat small which makes the house a mess again. I didn't have this problem when I was living by myself so it has started to irritate me quite a bit over time. This past weekend, when he was cooking, he happened to drop rice and some sauce on the floor and hadn't cleaned up after so I told him you need to be more careful about dropping things on the floor cause you make a mess sometimes. It caused him to get upset and he started profusely cleaning the floors. Then he proceeded to tell me I know this is your house, but it feels like I need to tiptoe around you here because I am not keeping the place exactly how you want it. I make a mess sometimes but I always clean up after. Might not be immediately but I do get to it and I do my best. I'm sorry that isn't good enough. And this isn't the first time you've said this. He told me the other time this happened was when he was cleaning out our oven and while scrubbing the burnt bits, it dropped black spots all over the white floor which irritated me. And apparently I had told him that he didn't do a good job cleaning the floor one time when I had asked him to do it. After he told me all this, I got upset because and started crying and he spent the next hour consoling me. I am neurotic about keeping the place clean - especially my kitchen since I have had a rodent problem. Ever since this, I have always found him on all fours on the kitchen floor trying to find every last speck of food because I feel like he is convinced that I would get upset again. AITA for telling him he made a mess in the first place and wanting to keep my house clean? EDIT: Clarified being on the deed EDIT 2: I deleted all my replies to the comments because I kept getting downvoted on every single one. I don't understand the downvotes to my replies when I have only thanked the commenters, been civil with my replies and taken their suggestions as good ones and agreeing to make some changes in myself.

        "selftext": "I broke up with my ex three years ago, but I still had a teddy bear from him. I didn\u2019t take it with me when I moved to the city where I study, I left it at my mom\u2019s house. Since it was fluffy and comfortable, she started sleeping with it every night. After spending a year abroad, I came back to my hometown for a month. Every time I saw that teddy bear, it reminded me of my ex and the moment he gave it to me, so I decided to throw it in the fire without asking my mom. I didn\u2019t think she was that attached to it, I only considered that I didn\u2019t want anything from my ex in the house anymore. Three days later, my mom asked about the teddy bear. When I told her I had burned it, she got really emotional, even to the point of crying. She said she had slept with it every night for the past three years, that it was really comfortable, and that it helped calm her breathing and anxiety. I genuinely hadn\u2019t considered how much it meant to her. I told her I\u2019d buy her a new one, but I haven\u2019t been able to find the exact same one yet. AITA for burning it without asking her first? EDIT: It was not just the teddy bear that I threw, it were all the things I had home from him, and not because I am angry at him or not moved on, but I did not want to have them anymore. I only mentioned the teddy bear as my mom was attached to it, thing I was not aware of.",

        "selftext": "Both me and my friend, Jane, go to a really competitive high school--but because we're friends, we never let it really get between us. We both even applied to a lot of top scholarship (QuestBridge, Gates, Coca-Cola, etc) and made it to finalist stages for QuestBridge together. In December, Jane matched to Duke University and only had to pay $10,000 over the course of four years. I did not get matched, so I did not receive the scholarship, but made finalist for the Gates Scholarship. This didn't tear our friendship apart but instead brought us closer--I was sad, of course, but I was happy for her. Fast forward to earlier today. She heard back from another big scholarship, and I told her to rescind her application as she already has QuestBridge. She did. Then, she heard back from another, and I told her, again, that she didn't need the money and to leave the opportunity for someone else who did. A couple hours passed, and she comes up to me asking for help with her essay, and I look at it with her. Then, she tells me that it was highly inconsiderate of me to tell her to rescind her applications, especially because I knew how much she needed it. At this point, I had taken two exams back-to-back, and was fed up w ppl. So I told her how it wasn't fair for people like me who didn't get matched, but deserved the money just as much as her. She then says how they have medical bills back from when her mom had cancer, and that it wasn't fair to her family that they pay for her school. I said that she could take a job, both during the summer and in college, so that they don't have to pay for her, but she stormed off. Now, I'm scared that I ruined our friendship, especially with something as small as this.  So, AITA?",

        "selftext": "GF has had two jobs these past three years. First job was through a friend of her father and the second job, I took my lunch break to go with her to apply. I literally had to motivate her in the car before she got the courage to walk in and apply. She suffers from anxiety and just the thought of applying to jobs is anxiety inducing. I can't count the number of times I have sent her places to apply online or we are walking past a restaurant with a hiring sign and she says she wants to apply and never does. This past summer we went again to apply for restaurant jobs and she broke down crying in the car because she was so overwhelmed. On another date she eventually was able to apply to a few. I walked with her along the way and kept my distance when she went inside. Unfortunately she did not get a call back. Months ago she told me that there was a restaurant close to her school that she planned to apply to but hasn\u2019t to this day. She got into a very prestigious academic program a couple years ago. Before that however, she lied to me about applying for a different program for months and only told me when she couldn\u2019t lie anymore. Last year I met the owner of a top firm in the field my girlfriend is studying and bragged about her and asked if she could email the owner with the hopes of getting an internship. I had to craft the email for her and she sent it off. I asked her a week after if she heard anything back from the owner and she said no which I found strange. It was only months later while in casual conversation that she admitted that the owner did message her soon after her email and she missed it and she didn\u2019t want to tell me because she was embarrassed. An opportunity at my workplace came up recently. We have spoken in the past about her working there and she said yes she would be okay working there as the money and environment is good. We had not been speaking for a couple weeks due to an unrelated issue so I decided to apply for her. I created an email and crafted a cover letter and resume and applied. The manager replied offering her an interview and I sent a screenshot to her asking if she was still interested. She said yes but then accused me of \u2018violating\u2019 her by doing what I did and also wondering \u2018what I else I could send without her consent\u2019. She is framing it as creepy and alarming. I feel like if she didn\u2019t have that history, for sure you can make that case but for her to act like I did without acknowledging her anxiety and past actions is deceitful and victimizing herself unnecessarily. It really took me by surprise and did hurt because I saw it as dishonest to frame what I was doing as such a big violation when she knows there\u2019s a whole recent history of her not being able to get jobs without help and avoiding applying for jobs. She has asked me in the past to help her draft stuff for her and help in applying for jobs so her framing what I did as something completely out of left field is disappointing. AITA?--",

My mom then started going on about how I need to go out with her if I wanted the ice cream, but I told her it was okay and didn\u2019t need it, it would just be nice.she would not accept that and started yelling at me at how I was loosing my independence and turning into a baby for not going out. she said \u201cyou are backtracking, I am coddling you and you\u2019re letting fear win.\u201d which no, I only asked her to get me food, and I\u2019m not just sitting around waiting for her to serve me.

We broke up a couple of times and came back together because I refused to let go and held on to him.Anyways, the last time we came back together before he proposed, I kind of pushed for it but it seemed like he felt what he had been doing was wrong and he said he was willing to change. Fast forward to getting married and living together, I contribute financially to the household. We both do. I do the cooking and the cleaning. He helps out with cleaning when he can. Sometimes when I clean he feels it's not up to his standard and starts cleaning again. Fair enough. A couple of days ago, the laundry was full and he put it in the washer and then asked why I didn't, then I said I was going to do it later. He then said, why didn't I do it then. I didn't say anything. We went to bed without speaking and on my way to work the next day, he called me after v texted during the night that I didn't th.. it's fair that he makes it out as if I don't do anything in the house. I then went on to say, I'm the one washing the toilets, doing the vacuum and although he puts the clothes in the washer, I have to pop them in the dryer and always did that and fold them back into the closet. He then went on to say it's not that I don't do them but I do them on my own time. But whose time would I do them on? I'm working. I do the chores on my off days cause I know that's when I'm free to cook and do cleaning.Then I said he should not help again then if he is going to keep complaining about the fact that he helps in the house and I told him to fuck off. Yeah maybe I was wrong for telling him to get off the phone but I think it's unfair to tell me to do the chores on his own time considering we both work.

        "selftext": "My partner and I recently started to live together at his place. He's been very accommodating and helped me feel at home ever since I moved in. There's one thing I feel we disagree on, and that's having company over every weekend.  When he was living alone he had a couple of good friends come over for drinks (nothing fancy, just catching up over a couple of beers) on a weekly basis, and he's the personification of my house is your house. They would raid the fridge, plop themselves on the couch and stay over well after midnight. They live with their parents and just like to be out of the house with every opportunity. Not an issue for me, but it's the main reason they like to come over instead of inviting us over to their place. I'm a very private person, I enjoy my own space and quiet time to decompress and relax on weekends. While I tried to also be accommodating and connect with his friends, the idea of having company and not being able to basically rot on the couch with just my partner is exhausting.  I talked to him about it and he said ok, we'll have them over when you feel like it. Thing is, I'm starting to never feel like it, it's almost a chore to me, I simply don't like people in my space. At the same time, I feel guilty about telling my partner not to have his friends over and socializing, as he's a lot more of a people person than I am.  Here's where I might be the asshole: my partner asked me to decide when to have them over because he doesn't want to impose and he wants me to be comfortable with it, so I texted them in advance and let them know we'd be having an early evening, instead of the usual. Once they left, my partner says he really enjoys their normal hangouts, and I was being antisocial for cutting it short.  We had a conversation about having people over every Saturday, and I suggested we compromise and maybe plan an evening out, have a few drinks and go back to our usual routine, at home. Or something along the lines of having them over once a month, instead of weekly. I don't want to deny my partner his need to be social and hangout with his friends, but since I'm now also living in the house, there needs to be some boundaries, and as much as I like his friends, I'm not always in the mood to share my space and not have  my quiet time for the sake of his bachelor days.",

Long story short, My (24M) fianc\u00e9 (21F) just surprised me with a $750 wood/propane two-in-one grill and was super excited leading up to giving it to me for Christmas, keeping it a surprise. We just moved into an apartment that is almost $1500 a month, both make about $3000 a month each, just had a baby girl a year ago, and are trying to save up for a home.  I got her a $200 cookware set and felt incredibly guilty getting the grill, as I grew up lower-class in a trailer and have never received a gift like this in my life. She saw my reaction and started crying, and I\u2019m trying to explain to her why we should return it because I want our main focus to be smart with our money right now, and I would never buy a grill like that for myself! I think because her dad is a grill-enthusiast she thought I would be head over heels for this thing.  I personally believe I could do just as good with a $200 charcoal grill, plus I\u2019m used to cheaper, smaller grills. I feel like an asshole telling her that I don\u2019t want the gift she obviously sacrificed a lot for, but I feel I will only use this thing maybe once a month and feel like an asshole having a brand new $1,000 grill while we just had a baby. I asked her not to give me a big gift anyways, if one at all.  Any more information I should leave here? Should I keep the grill and use it or return it so she can get her money back? AITA? ",

        "selftext": "My husband just received a promotion/new job offer at his job. His place of employment has historically not been a positive place and has been the cause of deep stress for him and strain on our relationship; however, it was recently bought out so company ownership is different and this new position would be kind of a fresh start. He let me know about his new position after he accepted it yesterday. He said that he cares how I feel about it and that he knows it has been rough but he thinks this will be a good thing. I do have mixed feelings, but I am incredibly happy for him and proud and I let him know that. I let it sit and gathered my feelings about all of it and then tried to talk to him about it today. I told him that I am happy and excited for him and that I want to support him in this, want to ensure we respect each other\u2019s feelings, and communicate so we can move forward positively together. He lost it. He said that I hate his job and will never be happy, that he does not want to discuss it - ever -, that he should not have to be my therapist and talk to me about it\u2026 the list goes on. I repeatedly told him I am happy and that I am not upset or angry and that it was a conversation about moving forward with mutual respect and positivity and I did not understand why he was angry and asked if he could tell me what he is upset about so I can try and understand. He could not tell me and just kept saying he never wants to discuss it and that I just always cause problems and am never happy. I am at a loss. I told him I apologize if I miscommunicated somehow, but I literally just wanted him to know that I support him and that even though it has been tough there I want us to move forward supporting and respecting each other (that is the text I sent him verbatim). AITA here? ** update - the stress and strain I refer to is that he has been so stressed he has stopped taking care of himself, going to workouts (which he loves), being angry at everything and snapping at everything all the time. He knows he is doing that and apologize saying he is sorry and that he is just stressed and needs to find a new job because he can\u2019t take it, feels disrespected there, and feels terrible for taking it out on our family. So it has affected our family. ",

They got married in a different country (17+ hour long flights to that country from where I live) and I would have to take 1-2 weeks off school to attend. I didn't want to fall behind and have my grades suffer since good grades are important for getting into a good college and good graduate school. My cousins also couldn't have their wedding during a holiday break, like Thanksgiving or Christmas.  So I ended up skipping both my cousins' weddings.  I finally had the chance to meet my aunt and uncle (my cousins' parents) as they were visiting. My uncle said he was disappointed and upset that I couldn't even take one week off school/college to attend his daughters' weddings. I, in a joking manner, responded that if my cousins ever got divorced, I'd gladly attend their second wedding.  (For context, I've graduated and am working for a company that offers paid vacation days. I could use those vacation days to attend a major family event like a wedding.)  My uncle seemed even more upset when I said that. I tried to console him. I told him it was a joke and that I hoped for nothing but the best for my cousins and their spouses.  Did I cross a line with my statement? Am I the asshole?",

        "selftext": "I, (19 M) Had to head out today in a three hour train ride. I prepared everything but noticed I couldnt find my charger. I had searched around the room and couldn't find any. Well I said no biggie, I will just take one from someone else. I was in a hurry and the closest room to mine is my mother's. on her shed I saw an unplugged charger. Now I will describe the charger a bit. It's a regular type c charger and that's it. No fast charging, nothing. I figured since it wasn't special in any way, I would borrow it. Its not like its the only one in the house but it was the closest. I took it and intended to send a message but it slipped my mind which I will admit was my fault.I didnt think about it too much until the way back when my mom called at me and screamed at me for taking the charger.I tried to tell her I couldn't find one in my room and that I was in a hurry but she had none of it and continued to scream at me. In the background I could hear my brother offering her literally multiple chargers and she refused, exclaiming that she wouldnt charge her phone with any charger other than hers. She screamed at me more before hanging up the call in my face and grounding me for a week. So reddit, AITA? EDIT: I read your comments and I can see how I was the asshole even after not thinking so intially. Thank you everyone for commenting.Do wanna clarify some things.  1. I did plan and had a bag ready and noticed it was missing when I woke up. I do admit I woke up later than I wanted to since I worked the nightshift. Atill doesnt justify taking a charger that wasn't mine. 2. It is VERY common for people in the house to borrow stuff without asking. I don't do it and the only time I did it was this. I guess that doesn't make me any better though since it aint fair to be mad at it and do it. Thank you everybody for commenting and I will do better <3",

He got out tonight while my dad had the window cracked because he is obsessed with going outside and learned how to push the window up. Everyone in the house knows this. My parents waited 30 minutes to tell me this. I have an anxiety and depression. My response when I heard this was of course crying and it lead to a panic attack. It was only for about 15 minutes and I collected myself but while I was having it my dad started screaming saying that he gets blamed for everything in the house. So a little context, my dad got injured at work and is now out of work because of this so he\u2019s been having a tough time. I never blamed either of my parents because this is not the first time Jax has gotten out but I knew in my heart of hearts this would be the last time. He was fighting with a cat that we suspected has rabies and logically with how long he was out there he was exposed, so we can\u2019t bring him back because it\u2019s too risky for us and my mom\u2019s cat. My mom said that I needed to stop being so dramatic in how I react to things because now my dad feels like I was blaming him, but I told her for not the first time that I have anxiety and tbh I collected myself pretty fast with no help from either of them. She basically was putting him before me when I was hurting because I knew he couldn\u2019t come home. I just feel invalidated even though I told my mom I didn\u2019t blame them and how they reacted was valid. Am i the asshole? Edit: as someone has said I was definitely wrong for not being more responsible and doing my enough research on how to take care of my cat. I\u2019m upset with myself for this. We never took our pets to the vet growing up and I thought he only needed the one shot and that was it because I was never told otherwise.  Update: he came home and Ive scheduled a visit to the vet. I checked him over and he doesn\u2019t seem to have any bite marks or scratches. He was checked over for fleas. The vet said even if he was exposed there is a low risk of anything because he has had the one vaccination. Keeping him away from my mom\u2019s cat for now. This was a very stressful situation especially since I have work today. He\u2019s mostly been under the blankets but has been fed and washed! ",

I came home one day to find that Vicky had used almost all my chips (I'd been able to eat like 5 or 6 before she got to them) to make an abomination of a meal that didn't even taste good. It looked like dog food. I'm not very confrontational, but the fact that she used my food in her cooking without establishing that it was okay with me. We have somwthing, not a rule, but something to that effect, in our kitchen that if something doesnt have a name on it, its free game, but I thought she would've thought to at least ask me to use them since it was a gift to me. It's a stupid thing to be hung up about, I know, but WIBTA if I just told her to stop using my food? Edit: I should've explained the whole policy thing better. It's not even that.

He is currently unemployed and the primary caretaker of our children while I work an average of 10-12 hours a day. All bills are on me and most days I\u2019m overwhelmed but so is he with two rambunctious children. In our old home he had a job but never contributed to bills and instead did fun things with the kids like pay for museum tickets and the zoo etc so I didn\u2019t mind. This month things are really tight, our eldest needed braces (she\u2019s under 10 y/o) and that was an unexpected expense. Anyway, when we moved into the house- the old tenants left a tv mount above the fireplace. The previous owner told us that it\u2019s difficult to remove because this is an old house with sensitive walls. After living here for about a month and a half my partner (without consulting me) decides to take down the wall mount. Ok- no problem\u2026 but he tells me he won\u2019t fill in the massive holes tonight. I ask when then? He storms off and doesn\u2019t say a thing. I already feel bamboozled with this house, so many things have broken and I\u2019ve been paying for them to be replaced or repaired. To hear, that a perfectly fine mount was removed for absolutely no reason is gut wrenching, especially after the repair costs I\u2019ve had to endure. Now I\u2019ve hired a task rabbit who will arrive in a few days to fill/sand/and paint this atrocious hole situation.  my partner is mad that I am paying for this. The last project at the previous house included building a cat corridor and dragging giant pieces of wood across my laundry room walls and never fixing it.  I know financially it isn\u2019t the best time to pay for ANOTHER repair so I feel like an asshole, however, I don\u2019t think I should feel that way because I was so excited for this home and it\u2019s already been a pain without my partners shenanigans. tldr; partner put holes in the walls by removing the TV mount without discussion and is mad that I\u2019m paying for the repair because \u201che\u2019ll get around to fixing it\u201d am I the asshole?

        "selftext": " My boyfriend (2 years) has a tendency to say extremely problematic things from time to time with me, in front of our friends, on social media etc. and I have a tendency to correct him (non condescendingly) Usually when he says them, half of the time he starts to realize what he\u2019s saying midway and then ends his statement with \u201cyeah I should learn more about this before I say anything.\u201d It\u2019s usually about a left leaning topic such as trans rights or feminism, the patriarchy etc.  For some context on why this is relevant or important is because we both work in the same field and we deal with these kinds of topics a lot.  While most of the times he is receptive to hearing out why what he says is problematic, he also sometimes \u201cchooses\u201d not to be as sensitive or open-minded, and gets angry at me for telling him that what he\u2019s saying is coming off wrong.  I understand that it\u2019s also exhausting to be wrong about things all the time and I hate correcting him too. I just do it so he doesn\u2019t say the same thing in public. Usually I try not to make a big deal of it, and add in a quick line like \u201coops u should say it like ___ if that\u2019s what u mean\u201d or \u201chey u should reconsider that.\u201d  I can understand why is comes off bad but I really don\u2019t know how to let him just go around saying those things either.  We both have had many discussions on how we will never blame anyone for their thoughts on something, and as long as they are willing to be open to another pov, they\u2019re not \u201cwrong.\u201d This is because it\u2019s extremely common in our country to have crazy opinions straight out of school because of the family backgrounds of people strongly influence the way they think. Anyway getting to yesterday, he said that people who don\u2019t understand our field of work are not classy, and to that I responded that it\u2019s classist to look down on people for not understanding something just because you do.  He got really mad at me for calling him classist, and I told him multiple times that I didn\u2019t call him classist, I called his choice of words and sentence classist.  It (in my opinion) got heated up for no reason when he could have just been like \u201coh didn\u2019t see it like that oops.\u201d At some point he finally apologized and then he called me a \u201cbitch\u201d for making him feel bad??? and compared me to someone that I really don\u2019t like.  I told him that\u2019s not ok and then the argument got even more heated and finally I told him I\u2019m not going to take his shit anymore and finally he said  \u201cI\u2019m sorry for being transparent with you. I\u2019m not going to talk to you for a few days. I\u2019m sorry for calling you hateful things, I need to change my personality, I\u2019m going to change, so that no one gets hurt anymore\u201d I tried to stay as calm as I could during the entire argument and I really do understand why he\u2019s upset. But I have no idea if I should stop or not. He has told me multiple times that I make him a better person so.  AITA?  EDIT: I would like to clarify a few things that are being debated in the comments. His problematic statements are NOT normal in our field of work, but ARE normal by common people in the place that we live. Some examplea of things he's said are trans women are a problem because they're just men who want to win the olympics in the women's category and Women do have equality they just want more thats why they keep saying they dont",

        "selftext": "I (25f) and my boyfriend (28m) have been together for almost a year. Our relationship was pretty calm and we got along very well until 2 weeks ago.  I had asked my boyfriend why he wasn\u2019t taking me out on dates anymore, and he explained that he just was busy with work and everything and bummed out. In the beginning, we would go on dates all the time, he would shower me with nice gifts, and make me feel like a princess. I hoped up, reminiscent of those times, and proposed a date idea, but he instantly shut it down, saying he was tired. I just dropped it after that, and he said we should order takeout. I said no, because I wasn\u2019t in the mood for takeout, and takeout seemed so cheap and thoughtless at that moment. Then he offered a park date, and even though that wasn\u2019t really what I wanted, I obliged. We walked for a bit and I was just instantly bored, but he seemed pretty happy the whole time, (In hindsight I get it now :/) but I didn\u2019t mind that. We walked to a nice sunset area and sat down. I started to enjoy it then as we talked about plans and the near future.And then out of nowhere, he asked what I thought about marriage. I told him I was definitely on board with marriage, and got to picturing the life we had married, and I started to wonder if maybe he wanted to propose, and that got me excited too. I was just imagining the pretty big gem on my finger and I was ecstatic just thinking about it. Then we left, and he stopped me. I looked back and he was on his knee, holding a box. I started to get very excited and jump and squeal\u2026 until he opened the box. There in the box, was the most pathetic, tiny ring with an even more pathetic tiny diamond. I was floored. My face just dropped, and I stood still. He looked at me, and said, \u201cWould you marry me?\u201d and I just shook my head lifelessly and walked away. I walked around, upset that he had just embarrassed me like that, with such a ring. He\u2019s called me numerous times to try and find me, but to be honest, that small ring just wasn\u2019t gonna cut it. I\u2019m thinking about breaking up with him because now I know he can\u2019t afford the lifestyle I want. We haven\u2019t really spoken much since, and I honestly don\u2019t feel like being with him anymore, what should I do?",

A couple weeks later we had to go to a family gathering since it was one of my cousins birthday, whilst we where sitting arround the table drinking hot chocolate and eating lunch  this interaction occurred: Mom: Storm (my name) has a YouTube channelMe: no stop momMom: OkCousin: oh cool what is it calledMe: I don\u2019t wanna talk about itMom: he just got one million views on a videoMe: Mom stop I don\u2019t wanna talk about itCousin: wow Storm you don\u2019t have to be embarrassed that\u2019s cool!Me: I was just on a short it doesn\u2019t matter(Then my mom leans a bit in over the table and places her hand on the side of her mouth so I can\u2019t see her lips and then whispers)Mom whispering: He posts himself doing parkourMe: mom stopCousin: cool don\u2019t be shy about it This was a super uncomfortable situation for me since I already am a bit introverted and don\u2019t like to talk about it which my mom does know.

        "selftext": "My boyfriend and I have been dating for a few months now, and things are going really well. We share a lot of common interests, and even when we differ, we enjoy learning from each other. We\u2019ve also set some boundaries, like keeping PDA to just holding hands and not bringing up each other\u2019s pasts unless it\u2019s mentioned first by said party. However, there's one small thing that really bothers me, even though it\u2019s not really that big of a deal. I get really anxious about phone calls. Whenever my phone rings, I instantly think there\u2019s something urgent or serious going on. I\u2019ve talked to my boyfriend about it, and while he\u2019s the opposite and loves calling people (since he thinks it\u2019s quicker and more personal than texting), I\u2019ve asked him to text me before calling if it\u2019s just for a casual conversation. This way, I can relax, knowing it\u2019s not an emergency, and decide if I\u2019m available to talk. It\u2019s also helpful because if I\u2019m in the middle of something, I can either finish what I\u2019m doing or let him know I\u2019ll call him back later. When he calls without texting first, I get stressed, and I don\u2019t like letting it go to voicemail because I worry something\u2019s wrong. And thus, no matter what I\u2019m doing, I will always stop everything to answer a call. A quick text helps me calm down. And don\u2019t get me wrong\u2026 I\u2019d love to hear him on the phone. Just, a text first would be nice. Recently, he called me without texting first, but it was for an emergency, so I didn\u2019t mind. However, since then, he\u2019s continued calling without texting, and while he apologizes when it happens, it still bothers me. I don\u2019t want to say anything because he\u2019s still dealing with said emergency that happened earlier, but I\u2019m starting to feel upset. I\u2019m unsure if I should just let it go since 1) its not a big deal, and 2) it\u2019s part of his character to call instead of text, or if I should ask him to change this for me. It\u2019s a small thing, but it\u2019s starting to weigh on me a bit. AITA?",

        "selftext": "Ok folks I'll be honest, this is incredibly low stakes and more to prove a point than anything else. The long and short of it is my husband asked me to turn off the lights after I laid down. We're on vacation, it's currently about 09:00 in the morning, and I'd turned the light on to read something on the computer as I don't like using my laptop in the dark.  After I sat back down on the couch next to him, he suggested I get some more sleep as I hadn't slept well. I agreed, laid down, and that's when he asked me to get the light. He couldn't because our infant daughter fell asleep on him, and we know if we move her within 30 minutes of falling asleep she'll wake up and be super crabby. As I was getting the light, I lightly accused him of AH behavior. My reasoning? He didn't say anything while I was sitting up, or even by my computer. He argues that because I left the light on, I'm the AH for wasting electricity. I then told him if it went up here, he'd be labelled the bigger AH and he said prove it. So here I am.  AITA for leaving a light on? Quick ETA: ok y'all, I hear you. I definitely came here full of bluster. I acknowledge calling him names was petty and childish, it's just how we've always played. Regardless, I should've just gotten the light after I was done and I've already promised him apology nachos. I made sure to send the link to my husband, and he and I have taken turns reading the answers. Respectful/neutral ones we just nod and agree with, more biting ones make us laugh. He says thanks for sticking up for dads!",

        "selftext": "AITA Hey so i\u2019m a 19 F dating my 21M boyfriend. We do not live together, however we often go over to each other\u2019s houses. When I go over to his place, I often will buy groceries and cook supper and do other things of the like. I\u2019m usually pretty good for picking up after myself, but I will admit I forget the odd thing. My boyfriend is very bad at picking up after himself and his house is often a disaster. Instead of owning up to his mess, he looks for the odd thing i\u2019ve left out and claims that I need to clean up his similar mess as well. For example, if I use a dish and forget to wash it, he insists that ALL of the dishes (including the large piles of dishes he leaves all over the counter) are now solely my responsibility to wash. I do not live with my boyfriend, and so I do not think it is my responsibility to pick up after him all of the time. I don\u2019t mind helping out here and there, especially if we are doing something together. But he will be sitting on the couch on his phone and ask me to do something for him so he doesn\u2019t have to get up.  I reached my breaking point when I was at my own home and he had sent me a photo of his garbage can that was slightly overflowing and claimed that \u201cyou need to take out your garbage\u201d. The garbage can was 95% full of his belongings, with my empty drink container on top. I simply responded and said that it wasn\u2019t my responsibility to take out his garbage as it was his own. He got mad and insists that because I \u201ctopped up\u201d the garbage I should take it out. Normally I would swallow my pride and just take out the garbage because it isn\u2019t a big deal, but it feels like this is just the start to having to pick up after him in his own home. He has started to leave his garbage full and leave things on the counters so when I put my garbage in the full can, it\u2019s all of the sudden my responsibility to take it out because I\u2019m the one who \u201ctopped it up\u201d. He thinks I\u2019m being unfair, and that if I\u2019m \u201cmaking a mess\u201d of his home the least I can do is take out the trash from time to time. If i start solely taking out the trash, I fear this will escalate until I end up doing all of this chores for him.  Am I the asshole for refusing to take out the garbage? I need a third party to tell me if I\u2019m being crazy before problems escalate between my boyfriend and me.",

To be clear I been with him for 5 years. I know I might be young but hearing the words I don't want to marry you did hurt. My issue is AITAH for fighting custody of my daughter so I can join the military? Ps he doesn't work at all so I'm financially support my daughter n I live with my parents n he lives with his. He does come every two days to see his daughter but he is in the phone most of the time and yells at my baby a lot.

I was assigned a computer with administrator privileges, so I can monitor the other computers in the lab. One day, I noticed that my classmate was playing a game on their computer. Since we\u2019re not supposed to be doing that, I decided to check on it using my admin privileges to confirm if they were actually playing a game or if I was just imagining it. When I checked, I saw that they were indeed playing a game, so I decided to mess with their computer to let them know they were breaking the rule. I didn\u2019t delete anything or do anything too extreme, but I did interfere with their work. Afterward, my classmate reacted to what I did, but they didn\u2019t say anything specific. They didn\u2019t seem upset or anything, so I figured it wasn\u2019t a big deal. I thought maybe they were just brushing it off. Later, I told the teacher that my classmate was playing a game on their computer. The teacher responded by saying that they were actually looking at their presentation.

She TEXTED me I don't feel anything for you like someone in a romantic relationship would. I think our relationship changed and i lost feelings.  I tried to understand why she lost feelings, asked her what she wanted to do. Take a break? End things completely? She would ALWAYS tell me i dont know.  Every question i asked her she would say that she didnt know. We were in this situation for like 3 days, i wanted answers, a reason why she wanted to leave me, what she wanted to do from here, but i got none.  Eventually i got fed up and told her I need an answer, you cant just fool me around, i deserve to know what you want to do and why you wanted to do it.  Mind you, this is all over text... we live 20 min away from each other but okay. She finally said she wanted to break up because she thinks no one can re-gain feelings for someone which i dont agree but thats not the point. Now that you have a backstory: would I be the asshole if i asked her for some expensive gifts i gave her?  I spent a lot of my money that I made working my ass off in sound and music production. I don't have a stable job, just little ones that i get offered from time to time because im also in college full time.  I gave her a lot of plushies and sylvanian families that she loves, which cost a lot of money... so i kinda want to ask for them back so i can sell them. I dont know if this is an asshole move.

        "selftext": "I (17f) should probably give a bit of context to my situation. I come from a low-income household where I live with my mother and younger brother. My father left my home several years ago, and my mother is a housewife, so I'm the breadwinner of the family. I work as an artist who makes commissions for others. A couple months ago, I found this girl (19f) on a shared Discord server and friended her. I introduced myself, showed her a couple of my art pieces, and asked her if she wanted to submit a commission so that I can make her something. She said she wasn't sure and wanted some time, which I respected. A couple days later I sent her another message and she said that she wasn't interested. I got desperate since I was struggling financially so I told her about my circumstances and asked her to help me. She was sympathetic and commissioned me. We started talking after that. I told her about my goal at the end of the month and she promised to help me. I said I wanted to try myself first. I learned that she was saving up for college and to move out of her parents' home. A month later, I reminded her of the promise she made. She told me that she was saving up, so I told her to just send me a fraction of that. I asked her for some financial support a few more times, whether to help me with a company idea, or because my brother was being hospitalized, and she did. Last month, I found out that one of my close friends (17f) who was also low-income had a getting hospitalized from a life-threatening condition. I was worried about her and wanted to help, so I told her about my online friend. After that, I texted the online explaining the situation and asked her to send some financial support. She said no, saying that she as much as my life sucked, I can't just keep asking money from her, since she also needed it for college and rent, and she can try to help me with finding some options but to stop asking her. I got pretty desperate because I wanted to help my friend, so I pleaded with her. In the end, she said that this would be the last time that she'd do this and sent it. Today, I tried my online friend but I found out that I was blocked. I still had her Discord, so I made a new account and tried to text her. When I told her who I was, she told me to leave her alone. I was shocked, because she's normally very sweet and kind, so I asked what happened. She explained that her parents found out and got mad at her, and she already told on a few different occasions that she was uncomfortable with sending me money, especially since she barely knew me, and made her feel like she was a bad person for feeling that way. I tried to apologize and promised that I wouldn't do that again, but she didn't trust my word and blocked me. I felt awful and explained to my mother what happened. She told me that while what I intended to do was good, I can't just ask people to share their money with me. So I'm just wondering, AITA?",

He helps me when I ask him to and ge often gets Up with the Baby in the Weekend, so I can stay in bed longer. So our Problem is this: I got Up the other night, trying to calm and nurse the Baby to sleep. I had to pee VERY HARD because I never geht Up to Go to the toilet, because the Baby will cry Out loud when I leave the room and I don't want to wake Up hubby or the other kid sleeping in our bedroom. So I waited and nursed for 49 minutes, very much in pain of the urge to Go to the toilet. But he did Not fall asleep. My husband awoke briefly and I told him I Had to per so hard that I almost wet the bed, but Baby doesnt Fall asleep. He Said I should Just Go and started to Fall asleep again. Few minutes later He got Up and went Out. He got a device to calm the Baby and went to the toilet. I immediately told him angrily, that If He was awake and got Up, He could have taken the Baby and let me Go to the toilet First! Then an Argument arose. He says, He can't ready my mind and I should Tell him exactly what I need. I know I have to Work on telling my needs, and I still think He could have known what I needed,since I was so clear in saying I have to pee. So do you think, I am the asshole for Not telling exactly what I needed? Or ist He the asshole, because He could have known?",

What was fun was that it's no receipts and cash only jobs so it's under the table and no taxes on that money!  Now she's got like 6 or 7 gigs and the objective of 400$/week is accomplished and I'm proud of her! She's legit her own boss!!! That's awesome!!  Buuut.. she got a little greedy.. she just accepted a gig that alone will bring in 350/week witch almost doubles my objective that I gave her.. except now she needs help getting around.. she doesn't have a license and needs my help to get to her gigs, witch makes sense and I don't mind, except I also work a 9 to 5 and when I Finnish work I gotta go pick up the kids at daycare, make dinner and keep them occupied. I don't have time to be a taxi!! Plus this job she accepted is asking for receipts... now she's gonna need to apply for a buissness license and might need a few weeks to get things legal She's now asking me if she would accept more gigs if I would quit my job to help her out.. honestly.. I like my job.. I do want to support her but.. I made a choice last year to pursue a new career path and things have been going well.. it feels selfish to say no.. but at the same time it feels like giving up on a dream..  Am I the asshole for saying: no I wouldn't quit my job to help her pursue her buissness..? ",

Said nephew is obsessed with this Kidoodle app, which contains stuff such as Ryan's World, Baby Shark and Like Nastya. This is something that, while the roommate does find annoying, he otherwise doesn't mind since he's always busy with game modding. However, I've been noticing as of late that it appears the brainrot he's been watching is having a noticeably negative impact on his behavior, especially in school. And I feel like that it's also what's causing his speech learning delay. I had enough of this after a while, so earlier today, I decided to uninstall the Kidoodle app from the TV, and I told him that it had shut down, meaning that those shows were gone forever. Needless to say, he *COMPLETELY* lost it. But I feel that it's for the best. Haven't heard from said roommate yet, as he's been out and about today, but I'm really not sure how he's going to react. So, my question is. Am I the asshole for lying to my roommate's nephew?",

Over the last year and a half, we\u2019ve had constant issues with and disagreements over communication and it\u2019s been having a very negative impact on our relationship. For context I am autistic, and she has been aware of this from the beginning of our relationship. She\u2019s knows that I have difficulty with implied meanings/hints/subtext, and to properly communicate with me effectively she needs to use clear unmistakable language. Last month we had another disagreement over a prior conversation we had via text. She claimed that she had asked in said conversation for me to go buy some groceries for a dinner we were planning to make together, and I told her that I would go to the grocery, but she never asked me before that moment. She got upset and repeated that she had, and I responded saying that we had the conversation via text and she in fact had not asked me. At that point she shut down and went to get the items herself.  Following this incident, we had another face to face conversation, and she mentioned showing the previous text conversation to her sister and a friend to see if she was in the wrong, and said they both agreed with her. I considered doing the same and asking my friends, but I know that they\u2019d just co-sign whatever I said, and so I\u2019m here with a throwaway for unbiased opinions.

She had her big birthday 4 day ski trip cancelled because of weather and is pissed because she had been planning it for a while. She made a big deal out of it because in her eyes she never got to celebrate anything. We went for a meal and karaoke but she didn\u2019t feel like it was enough of a celebration.  Tbh our family isn\u2019t big on celebrating anything but my sister kind of brought it on herself. My sister put a lot more pressure on herself when she was younger because everyone told her she was a genius. She skipped grades and graduated high school at 16. She didn\u2019t attend prom because she was younger than the other students so even though she was a senior she hung out with student her own age more so she didn\u2019t have friends to go with. Plus if I remember correctly she had AP exams afterwards so she spent that night studying because at that point she needed an A in every subject. She always says it was her biggest regret in life. Our parents didn\u2019t put that on her she was just over the top back then. I think it\u2019s overblown because she is very successful now in a job that\u2019s hard to get into so it\u2019s not like her hard work wasn\u2019t rewarded. Tons of people work hard without much to show for it which is worse.   She was complaining to me constantly about her 30th being ruined and said she only has her wedding to look forward to now (she isn\u2019t engaged yet but probably will be this year). I told her she shouldn\u2019t put so much on the wedding and it\u2019s just an expensive party which she can afford yes but it\u2019s still a lot to be putting on a single day. She said it\u2019s her last chance to celebrate something and all the achievements she had has been pushed aside to make room for the next thing and she wants her wedding to be memorable like her 30th was suppose to be but in a good way. She mentioned again skipping prom as an example and I told her that skipping prom to study is kind of a humble brag but more so it\u2019s not a big deal. I went to prom and honestly it wasn\u2019t that interesting, I get she missed it and it sucks but she has way better things in life rn. She got mad and said I got a lot more things celebrated than her so I don\u2019t understand what it\u2019s like to go back and realize there isn\u2019t even a single photo of the event. I\u2019ve texted her a few times since and she just replies with one word answers and I just wonder if she\u2019s overreacting or I\u2019m the asshole here. ",

On top of that, each of us has saved around $3,000 from birthday money saved for future expenses (such as university) I\u2019m considering withdrawing my $2,600 so that if our dad\u2019s money ever runs low, I won\u2019t have to dip into my own hard-earned cash.

By the way, my dad works extremely hard to get us into private schools and pay houses. He also owns a few small companies, and sometimes he needs to borrow money.  However, I would say we are decently well off and my two brothers recently got the IPhone 16 Pro Max (I didn\u2019t get one, but he offered to one day get me an MacBook to make it even).

Once I do that, i go back inside expecting to see my mother ready to go. She explains that my Aunt was in the shower and wanted my mom to stay. I just said whatever and went back upstairs. Everyone around her was drunk and I was nervous at the thought my mom would also get drunk and try to drive me home. I also just really don't like drunk adults, they scare me (this also connects to the fact that last time everyone was drunk there was a fight and my uncle got hurt.) . I go upstairs for about another hour. I walk down the steps and peak my head over to peer at my mom who was sitting at the table. She was drinking out of a plastic cup and i felt my heart drop to my stomach. There was also a beer bottle sitting on the counter. She reassured me earlier that she was drinking Pepsi but my anxiety was taking no mercy at the time. I calmly walk upstairs to the bathroom and pace back and forth for a while. I pace up and down the steps, peering over once again. I just decide to go outside and talk my anger out. I go outside and grab a random box and bend it and kick it. It didn't help. I walk back in the house with everyone in the kitchen staring at me (probably because i was acting like a fucking lunatic). I go back into my cousins room to calm myself. after about 30 minutes i get impaitent and go to peer over the stairs again. they were all still drinking and my mom promised we'd leave 2 hours ago. I begin pacing again, scream into a pillow, and then i start feeling like i cant breath. so i run downstairs telling my mom i cant breath and she's acting like it's nothing (probably because i've embarrassed her enough). She then finally decides to go and i get yelled at from the moment we walked out the door to the minute we get home. I understand it was bratty and i still get her snarky comments about it from time to time. I think i'm the asshole. I just wanted to get this off my chest.",

        "selftext": "Pretty much the title, I\u2019ve been working on cleaning out my house and I\u2019ve come across a lot of my siblings old video game mostly Nintendo 64, GameCube, Wii, and DS and 3DS.  NOW they know the left them here when they moved out 6 years ago and they\u2019ve never taken them despite all the times they have been here since, the games are on a shelf in the living room and clearly visible, now when ever I\u2019ve asked before it\u2019s \u201cnext time I\u2019ll grab them\u201d(I\u2019d like to say I\u2019m not mad that they haven\u2019t gotten them yet but I would very much like to use the shelf\u2019s now) and it\u2019s been several months since the last time I\u2019ve mentioned collecting them and they still haven\u2019t nor have they themselves mentioned it unless I\u2019ve brought it up.  I\u2019m not just going to throw the games out or donate them I play video games to and I know some of these are still pretty valuable for collectors. (The console for the games are here too btw) So WIBTA? Also since so many keep asking, It\u2019s my house I own it. I\u2019m 33F and sibling is 37NB  Also in our state anything left past 30 days can be considered abandoned. Edit for some Q and A:  Time frame: last time I asked was in September and specifically asked them to take them when they came down for Christmas because I would need the space after.Sibling was down for 3 days for Christmas and didn\u2019t box them up and take them Why haven\u2019t I boxed them up?: at the time they weren\u2019t in the way plus it\u2019s a shelf with a glass door and keeps them all safe. Some of my stuff is in there too Why I won\u2019t box them up and send/take them: I\u2019m not our mother nor am I paying for shipping and I know sibling won\u2019t.And I should not have to clean up after an adult for nothing. For context I\u2019m 33F sibling is 37NB. Distance/Visits: Sibling lives only like 40 minutes to hour away (depends on traffic/weather) and we usually see each other twice a month possibly more and we flip on who goes to who\u2019s house Why I need the space: I got a new bigger T.V and I needed a new entertainment center for it, old one was big with lots of storage space for games/blu-rays the new one only has about 1/3 the storage of the first",

Tonight I was watching him play, he plays on console and while he got into a firefight he was shooting the ground for half his clip so I made fun of him a bit. It was just a basic joke like \u201cLol he\u2019s shooting the ground\u201d. But my dad was in a motorcycle accident years ago and lost a lot of the mobility in his left hand because of it, so he has trouble playing on the controller. I wasn\u2019t thinking about this at the time, just poking fun because he was shooting the ground for a long time. My family often rips into me during gaming so I thought it would be ok. But he replied with these exact words, \u201cShut the fuck up. I\u2019m sick of you. It\u2019s already unenjoyable to play with you.\u201d  I didn\u2019t even know what to say, I just went silent and left the room. I feel like he must have been very upset and hurt to react in the way that he did.  He had previously been saying that it sucks that he mostly plays alone now so I\u2019ve been playing with him whenever I can. I don\u2019t actually like Fortnite anymore, so I play just for him, but now I\u2019m wondering if I\u2019m actually just being a burden on him and actually very unfun to be around whenever I\u2019m on Fortnite.  I just recently received an ADHD diagnosis and I\u2019m grappling with feeling worried that people hate me and that I\u2019m annoying, to hear my dad say that definitely hurt. I also just lost a bunch of friends due to things that I didn\u2019t even realize were issues until it was too late. So this really solidified me feeling that my behavior is not OK to others but I don\u2019t know how to fix it. I don\u2019t know how to act in a way that is perceived positively by him.  I know that his limited mobility is hard for him but I didn\u2019t know it was such a sore spot regarding the aim, now I feel extremely guilty and sad that I hurt his feelings. AITA?

We\u2019ve been together for 2.5 years, but financial struggles and legal issues are making it impossible to afford our current place. It\u2019s devastating\u2014I feel like a failure, and talking about it is really hard. I also have severe ADHD, making emotional regulation difficult. On top of that, I\u2019ve been sick for 10 days, unable to work, and completely drained. Despite knowing this, my mom only wants to talk about finances. I get that she\u2019s worried, but she keeps pushing the conversation despite my repeated boundaries. I physically can\u2019t talk\u2014I lost my voice from coughing so hard I\u2019ve been throwing up. I\u2019ve told her this, yet she keeps bringing it up. I\u2019ve lost nearly 15 pounds from being sick and have begged her to stop, but she won\u2019t. Tonight was the last straw. My fianc\u00e9 is also sick and acting like a big baby about it. I reached my breaking point and snapped at him, but he apologized, realizing I\u2019m just as sick. We\u2019re now resting together, trying to recover. Before that, I considered going to my mom\u2019s for support. I called her, crying, barely able to speak, and she immediately started talking about finances again. I lost it and sent this text: All week, you\u2019ve pushed to talk about finances because I was too sick for our meeting. I am still too sick. If you were this sick, you wouldn\u2019t want to discuss finances and feeling like a failure. If I kept pushing a topic you repeatedly asked me to drop, you would have a meltdown. I\u2019ve been actively breaking down for three days, yet you keep ignoring my boundaries. This is no longer concern\u2014it\u2019s blatant disrespect. I have so many texts where I\u2019ve politely asked you to stop, explaining that I cannot physically or mentally handle this while I am sick and miserable. Right now, I would rather be homeless than live in a house where my boundaries are ignored. This is so upsetting, and I needed to say it because you aren\u2019t listening. Goodnight. Was I too harsh?

        "selftext": "So me (18M) and my girlfriend (18F) has been together a just over a year now, and we both have eachothers phone passcodes. Early on in the relationship I've established that I don't agree with obsessing with celebrities or saving videos of someone you find attractive on social media if you have a partner - she agreed and didn't have a problem with this. A couple times however I've found her doing this. One time she thought I was asleep, she was on her phone and I saw she had a bunch of thirst traps saved (all of the same actor). When I pretended to wake up she deleted them as quick as she could which I found very odd, because now it seems she's trying to hide it. That was half a year ago, but yesterday whilst she was sleeping, I went on her Tiktok. Initially I went on it to troll a mutual friend of ours, I was going to send them a silly message but then I saw that my girlfriend had been sending this friend thirst traps of that same actor from before saying things like Silent repost because my boyfriend would be upset or I fear I would fall for this man but don't tell my boyfriend I said that. I felt so disrespected because she's actively trying to hide it, and this is something she KNEW I would be upset by. Anyways, I then went through her favourited videos and as I thought, a bunch of thirst traps and edits of the same guy over and over again. I know people are going to say You violated her privacy, you clearly didn't trust her in the first place but we've given eachother our passcodes so I don't think it's that problematic, she could've gone through my phone too. Let me know if that's a wrong way of thinking. I confronted her and she smiled and laughed and said you've made yourself sad now why would you do that. She saw I wasn't happy and changed her demeanor, and said she didn't know what to say. We talked and I said how I felt betrayed, she crossed a boundary and how I thought it was disgusting that she was fully aware she was doing something I wasn't comfortable with and tried to hide it. We didn't get into an argument, we were laying in bed saying things individually, taking long pauses to think of what to say, no shouting just calm discussion. When she got home, her parents asked why she was upset and she told them the situation but her parents are very angry at me for going through her phone in the first place, and said that I didn't trust her. She also texted me saying she also thought the same thing but didn't want to tell me when we were hanging out because she didn't want to make the situation worse. I haven't told her I wasn't even planning on going through her phone in the first place but rather just wanted to troll that friend of ours. I know that I should've just left it at that and ignored the videos she sent, rather than going through her favourites. I just want opinions on the situation, am I the asshole for having gone through her phone, or am I right in saying she's in the wrong for having crossed a boundary?",

        "selftext": "I am a female thats still in HS. Am i a pos for making fat jokes to them? It started when we would just go and joke around about our appearances and whatever. It didn't offend me at all. I called them fat (okay fatty haha) in a joking way and I was assure that they knew I was joking- and I never meant to ACTUALLY bring them down on purpose.  I was always made fun of for my appearance and my looks and all that shit when I was in elementary up until now. I thought that it was normal to make fun of it. But- I never actually meant it if I did make comments. I would only do it if my friends started making fun of each others appearances.  I found out recently from one of my friends that is apart of this friend group that the girls were upset and uncomfortable by these Jokes. I texted her and told her I understood and i wouldn't make these jokes anymore. So since i was at home at the time, I texted both of the girls I hurt. I apologized to one and they accepted my apology. (Im aware apologies dont fix everything and I still left that person hurt.)  But Then i go and text the second girl I have yet to apologize to and I found out she blocked me weeks ago. Even though I never actually said those fat jokes directly to her, she still blocked me. I feel like a Pos.  Mind you, Im very aware that I tend to not think before I speak a lot of the times and I reassured them to tell me if I say anything that hurts their feelings. But I just found out that they were uncomfortable with letting me know. So that makes me feel like an even bigger pos.  ive apologized, ive done everything I can to assure that ive realized my mistake but I feel like they dont want to be friends with me anymore.  I grew up with barely any friends, always one or two, or none. So losing friends makes me very emotional.  ",

        "selftext": "I (F16) absolutely used to Adore my English teacher (F49) until recently. So in December of 2024 i turned 16 and i was so so so excited for my birthday and i had been talking for weeks about it to my favorite teacher (English teacher). She seemed kind of careless about it but i didn't think anything about it. Worth to note, i have extremely strong emotions. So i was super excited about my birthday, smiling and giggling all morning. During English class (first period) me and my best friend sat outside and talked about our grades with the teacher. My bestie asks if the teacher has forgotten something. It takes a while before says asks if it was my birthday and i joyfully said yes. For the record in my country every single day of the year have 1-2 names like tied to it so if it's your name or middle name it's your names birthday. My English teachers middle name happened to have a name birthday the same day as my normal birthday. I asked her jokingly where my happy birthday was. And she replied with well where is my cake? it honestly pisses me off a bit. I know it doesn't have anything with religious reasons either as she has said herself that she's an atheist and does in fact celebrate birthdays. Her sassy answer made me kind of upset especially when almost all of my other teachers wished me a happy birthday. The special needs teacher specifically was super joyful towards me. To her i had just briefly said it once and she remembered (my birthday that is) . I give all my love to her for that. It made me feel like why can everyone, even teachers i don't like wish me a happy birthday but not my favorite teacher. I want to include one more thing. She might have actually mocked my attachment issues. I used to struggle with attachment issues (towards teachers) in middle school due to being bullied, having barely any friends and really poor mental health. I have told max 5 people about what i went through. My English teacher was one. She said like okay, see you tomorrow. I asked why she had responded so short and well pretty much unattended to the thing i told her and she simple said well, we don't want you to become attached again now do we. It might not have been a mockery but it really didn't feel positive as it was a fresh wound and at the time i was still struggling with getting unattached to my old teachers. I told her to piss off after that and she didn't seem to happy about it.  So AITA for thinking she is acting well like an A-hole? Edit one : i knew a lot of people would think i'm the A-hole and i understand why but telling me that nobody has to care about me, that's pretty fucking mean. Like i understand that she doesn't owe me anything but that doesn't mean NOBODY has to care about me. I know it was childish of me to be upset but sometimes that's how life works. As people also said i am still a literal child, i am well aware that the behavior won't fly and i am trying to get out of it. Also for the people saying teacher attachment is inappropriate and weird trust me i know, i have apologized to teachers in the past i was attached to since i knew that my behavior was inappropriate. I'm doing my best to get away from that issue but it's hard.",

        "selftext": "This is a throwaway for pretty obvious reasons I (17F) am a part of a blended family with two brothers, 19M and 15M. We have been a blended family since my youngest brother was 2 years old, meaning he has grown up around my family as his own. He has been a part of every single family gathering and has been deeply included due to my extended family's belief that family is more than blood. This idea is especially potent due to my father being adopted. Anyways, my younger brother, who we will henceforth call Thomas, and my second cousin, who I will call Sharon, are the same age. Due to living in the same area, unlike other family members, we see Sharon and her family often. Back when they were 13, they dated for the first time, which I promptly found out about and shamed my little brother for. To say I was livid would be an understatement. My stepmother was weirdly okay with this and even encouraged it. My father just said to let it be because he did not want to influence my brother into rebelling against them by continuing to date Sharon. They soon after broke up because, well, to put it in nice terms, no two sane people date people they are related to. So, you can imagine the craziness between them. Sharon would call my brother Thomas at all hours of the day, demanding that he be in constant contact with her. When I say constant, I mean constant. If he even went to dinner, she would call him and scream at him for leaving her. Apparently, my little brother has been hanging out with her again, and my parents have found a photo of her as my brother's lock screen, indicating that they are again dating. Of course, when I was told about this, I went a little berserk and threatened   blurted out that I should to out their relationship to their entire high schools as a form of deterrent. My father was able to stop me from doing this, and I now agree that it is most likely a bad idea to do that. My second idea was to talk to my father's cousin, who is Sharon's mother, and discuss what we can do moving forward to discourage this type of behavior. My father is trying to stop me from doing this as well, as he believes that it will again cause my brother Thomas to rebel against him and continue to date her. But if I'm being honest, I have bigger concerns at this point, as my cousin Sharon has had a lot of erratic behavior in the past, and this event is a sign of her lack of regulation surrounding her emotions as well as a lack of healthy boundaries. I have seen my brother Thomas briefly today and have already spoken to him very briskly but in no unclear terms to stop dating his cousin. He pretended like he did not hear me. I told my father about doing this, and he is now upset with me because he is very concerned about this escalating their behavior. So Reddit, am I the asshole EDIT  It has come to my attention I have used the word threaten incorrectly. I forgot to mention English is not my first language. I believe the proper word would be blurted out.  ",

        "selftext": "Am I the asshole for confronting my neighbor? So it\u2019s not my neighbor but my sister\u2019s. My sister lives at the corner of her neighborhood and these two black trucks always accelerate around the corner. She has two young kids that are just now learning how to bike and it\u2019s been bothering her for some time. We pulled into the driveway around 11pm at night when all the sudden one of the black trucks speeds by us. My sister is insisting that we go and confront him. So I drive us over there. She introduces herself as his neighbor and says that his truck and another truck always speed around the corner and that she has 2 young kids. He says the other truck is his son\u2019s.  She politely asked him if they could slow down. His reply was \u201cdo you have radar lasers in your eyes\u201d? She said excuse me and repeats himself. At that point I got annoyed and said let\u2019s go, this guy is a dickhead. He raised his voice and called her a degenerate mother because while her kids are riding bikes she\u2019s sitting in the road near the corner\u2026 but she\u2019s only there in case one of those trucks speeds around the corner.  At that point I repeated myself much louder this time to make sure they both heard me. She starts walking back and he says step on my property to me. I tell him I\u2019m not stepping on your property and we start hurling insults at each other. We drive off still hurling insults at each other. I later found out this guy has a reputation for being a dick. They live four houses down from each other and I\u2019d hate for him to speed by out of spite and something bad happen. I told my sister (since she lives there) to go by and reintroduce herself and apologize. To basically say \u201c11pm was not the time for that and my brother was way out of line. He gets defensive of me, but we were wrong and for that I\u2019m sorry. Do you think when you come around the corner you could just slow down? I\u2019m just looking out for my kids.\u201d AITA for reciprocating his energy and is the apology a good idea for quick deescalation?",

        "selftext": "This argument happened in a previous relationship, but I still think about it and wonder if I was in the wrong. I, a 21-year-old woman at the time, was dating my 22-year-old boyfriend, Zach. Zach and I had been dating for about 1.5 years, but we were long distance due to college. So, when we were in the same state, we were inseparable. One night after we had sex and were about to fall asleep, I rolled over to find Zach playing a car video game on his phone. I cuddled into him, hoping he\u2019d put the game down, but he kept playing. I jokingly said something like, \u201cI guess I\u2019m more boring than the game.\u201d He laughed and explained that he played this game most nights before bed, like how some people read or watch shows to wind down. He said it wasn\u2019t personal and not to take it the wrong way. Over time, this became a regular thing, and I started to feel uncomfortable with it. A bit of context: I\u2019m queer, and at the time, I had a strong preference for women. Zach and I had been friends for years before we started dating, so while I loved him, he was the male exception for me. Because of this, I was particularly sensitive to things that might turn me off when it came to intimacy. Eventually, I got frustrated and told him I wasn\u2019t okay with him playing phone games in bed. I said he could play, but not while we were naked together. He then argued that he needed it; it was part of his nightly routine and helped him unwind. I told him that was stupid which was not nice and he totally shut down. I felt bad that I couldn\u2019t just let this go but it was starting to effect our relationship. Was I the asshole for not being able to get past my boyfriend playing video games in bed?",

        "selftext": "So basically 2023 was a really tough time for me emotionally speaking. My grandpa's brother, who we often visited and had great conversations, died in January. That was a really big factor of my mental state, but there were other factors as well. To summarize, my grades were really bad and I was extremely sad and hopeless for the longest continuous period of time in my life, ever.  So, I decided, for some reason, that I'll talk about my problems in the class group chat. The response was immediately dismissive. The crux was that I didn't know what exactly is the problem, I just knew something is very much off. So my classmates were like Why are you talking about your problems if you don't even know what they are? We can't help you if we don't know what you need help with.    In my messages I would describe myself as having a breakdown/tantrum. And I just want to say, I am aware that just because I was in a tough mental state it doesn't mean I'm allowed to drag my classmates into it and do whatever I want. But overall, this has been on my mind a lot since it has happened, and I just want to know what others think. From both sides of the fence.  Thank you!",

        "selftext": "So, this just happened, bear with me while I collect my thoughts.  Today my mother recieved a message from her step nephew. Her brother, my uncle, married a woman who already had 2 kids. He cared for them as if they were his own and we've always been close, even though they live in another country.  The message read something along the lines of Tell your family never to speak to my mother again. You should be ashamed of yourselves. Tell your parents their son would be ashamed of them. We were so confused. For context, we are currently on vacation that my grandparents paid for. Just immediate family, my grandparents, my parents, my brother, my husband, me and my son.  My uncle passed away a few years ago and since then, my mother communicates regularly with my aunt. We face timed her for Christmas. Up until that message, we had no indication anything was wrong. Now my aunt won't answer her calls and her step nephew is refusing to elaborate. Here comes the part where I might become an asshole. My mom has asked us not to tell my grandparents. My dad, brother and husband all know. I know because I was there when my mom got the message. I told my husband and my mom told my dad and my brother.  I think my grandparents deserve to know. I think they could shed light on what happened. My nana talks to my aunt all the time, so maybe something happened? They are napping right now, so it will be a little while before I have the opportunity.  We have speculated on causes but we really have no clue.  So, WIBTA if I went against my mom's wishes and told my grandparents about the message? Update: I spoke to my mom again. All of that side of the family has blocked her on all social media. They have not blocked anyone else, at least as far as I know. My aunt has not blocked or unfriended me, nor has her daughter or granddaughter. I hadn't noticed (I'm not on Facebook much) but the one who sent the message, his wife unfriended me at some point. No idea when. We still don't have an explanation, but I thought you guys might like an update. I haven't told my grandparents, as the consensus seems to be that it's up to my mom. And I get that. For now, as long as she promises to tell them eventually, I'll hold my tongue. Update 2: My mom told my grandparents. They are as confused as we are. They haven't spoken to anyone on that side since about a week before our trip. And it turns out my grandparents were about to send a big cheque. My grandfather has said he won't send the cheque until we get this sorted. My nana is annoyed that they used her son against her for what she perceives as no reason. I think I need to add the context that we live in Canada and they live in the US. And the message came on the day Trump instituted those tariffs. We've always had a difference of politics (they love Trump for some reason) but we almost never talk politics with them. My grandfather thinks they will come around once they realize the money has dried up. Also, they were supposed to send my nana part of my uncle's ashes and they never have. She deserves to have her sons ashes. All of this came out as my nana muttered angrily.",

        "selftext": "My fianc\u00e9e (31F) and I (33M) have a daughter together (2F). My mom passed away in 2020, my dad lives on the other side of the country, and my fianc\u00e9e's parents both passed away in 2014. That leaves the only grandparent figures to my daughter that live nearby as my own grandparents (69F and 72M), who live about 15 minutes away. My grandma (step, but has been a grandma to me my whole life) has an incurable cancer, and my grandpa has dementia that is early on but progressing. Partly for these reasons, we would like our daughter to get as many memories with them as possible while they're still around and before my grandpa's memory loss becomes severe. There was one time we attempted an overnight stay with them while we were home by ourselves. It didn't go so well; she had a hard time going to sleep and was clear she has some separation anxiety. It wasn't all bad, but clearly something that needs to be worked on.  Ever since, my grandma, who between the two of them is usually the one we talk to and who makes decisions, has been quick to point out examples of her showing separation anxiety when around (which has become infrequent, the last time being on Christmas). When asking if they'd be willing to take her for a couple hours to get some time with her, whether just because or we have something to take care of, she refuses, saying she needs to get over separation anxiety before they can take her again. Our thoughts are that she won't get over it if we don't give her a chance to. And we don't exactly have a village of people able to help with that, as partly mentioned before. Meanwhile, my grandparents frequently watch the kids of my cousin (25F), the kids being 6F, 4M, 3M, and 2F. She is no longer with either of the two fathers and has been known to frequently dump her kids on our grandparents. My grandma has said multiple times after various incidents of disrespect that she will not help my cousin anymore, but ultimately winds up doing so anyway. When we bring up these issues, my grandma claims that because these kids are not well taken care of (sadly true), she needs to keep a closer eye on them; we take this as our daughter being punished for being well taken care of. She also believes they do not have separation anxiety because of the rocky relationship with their mom, so they are more willing to be at their house. She takes our pushing that we accuse her of playing favoritism with the other kids.  We realize that someone has to watch those kids so their mom can work. My situation is more fortunate in that regard as I work while my fianc\u00e9e is a stay at home mom. But we think there needs to somehow be more balance in the situation. And again, to have my daughter and grandparents to get plenty of time together before it's too late. So... AITA?",

But Amy had a habit of talking over people and cutting them, which ticked Sarah off A LOT. After 3-4 months, we finally confronted her about it, and Sarah went really low contact with Amy. Although i did want to continue being friends with Amy, i went no contact with everyone for a solid 2 months. After this, we slowly started talking as i took the initiative and contacted her, apologized and suggested to reconcile. She agreed and we agreed to meet up. On the day of the meetup, my parents needed me for some things so i had to cancel. Then we changed the dates, but my doctor's appointment was finalized on that day, i thought i could meet up with her after that, but doc was out for lunch and returned half an hour later, which is why i canceled it. I asked her today whether she'd be interested in meeting up, but she declined saying that i had disappointed her twice. Since we're in a very tense and delicate situation, I'd like some clarity.AITA? Update: After being schooled by everyone here, i spoke to Amy. We exchanged perspectives and she said that she felt guilty about the whole ordeal and it never occurred to me that she wouldn't be angry at me, but at herself. I told her that i fumbled real hard(\ud83d\udc80) and that I'll respect whatever her decision is. And unfortunately for some people who were expecting Amy to cut me off, (bless her heart) said she'll consider it and tell me what her final answer is soon.

        "selftext": "Throwaway because my partner/friends/family are avid redditors. Though this post is so obviously me, they might even know at this point.  I\u2019m not really sure what led up to the conversation about this. My partner (20M) and I (22F) started by disagreeing about peeing in the shower alone. He said that it\u2019s not normal for people to do it AT ALL. My whole family are shower pee-ers. I\u2019ve been raised to, if needed, pee, and then take a normal shower and it\u2019s acceptable since the soap washes it down. I\u2019m not a UTI girl either, so no crazy bacteria is spread to those who share the shower. I\u2019ve heard that this can be damaging to the pelvic floor and what have you, but other than that, peeing in the shower isn\u2019t damaging to the shower or worthy of jail time. My partner said it\u2019s just weird to pee in the shower overall at this point. I then share how it\u2019s something I\u2019ve grown up used to and something I consider environmental for me because, though I hate to admit, I use more toilet paper than is likely needed and it certainly saves some squares. We obviously disagree about solo peeing in the shower, but here\u2019s where it gets iffy (and slightly weird). We started arguing about how gross it is when we shower TOGETHER. Oftentimes I will do it before he gets in, but sometimes I\u2019m waking up in a morning shower, and I will strategically aim myself straight down the drain (as I can only direct myself in one position) and whizz. I move as FAR away as possible from him, give him plenty of warning, and even ASK if it\u2019s ok, to which he says it\u2019s fine. Yet, he says he HATES this; not only did he say it\u2019s not normal to pee in the shower alone, but peeing in any shower is weird, especially with him present. Now, I\u2019m not usually one to fight against things like this, because I understand it\u2019s a boundary, but holy moly y\u2019all. He then said he\u2019d rather have blood than pee getting on him. Now, that seems a bit more dangerous than my piddle puddle. Ok, ok. At this point, I said I would stop doing it while he\u2019s present, and make it a personal experience, but even that is gross to him, and now he\u2019s going back and forth about who\u2019s \u201cright\u201d here. He even said he\u2019d try it out to see how it feels. I can see why it might be gross for some people, but as long as I\u2019m not aiming at him, am I so wrong? NSFW: keep in mind the bodily fluids that are often shared between partners outside the shower. That\u2019s all I\u2019ll put up to mention as well. Someone please tell me the regularity/normalcy (or not) of peeing in the shower alone OR with a partner. I\u2019ve decided to stop for now but I didn\u2019t realize it was that big of a deal. Help. AITAH??? TLDR: my partner disagrees that it\u2019s normal to pee alone in the shower, and especially when we\u2019re showering together.  ",

I ticked him off a little too much for \u201cnot respecting the other people in the building\u201d and I was kicked out I had three days to clear everything out. I had also just lost my job working at the local grocery store, so I had no home and no job, just an internship at a real estate agency which I was only getting $10 an hour from; I was struggling. Luckily, one of my friends (27M) who I have known since high school offered to let me stay in their house while I found a place to live and a new job. Once, I was moved in, he said that it was nice to have someone to make him less lonely. After about two weeks of living together he started repeatedly asking if I had found any job listings and saying he found one that I would like. I had found a few places on my own too but honestly there wasn\u2019t anywhere for me that fit what I needed, good money, easy and chill, low hours, and close to my living space. And then another week went by, and he started bugging me about finding a place to live, claiming he found some great places, but honestly, I like living with him, it\u2019s nice and he has a great house. I was trying to hint to him that we could just live together, but he wasn\u2019t getting it. He started calling me a little kid because I \u201cwasn\u2019t doing anything ever and just wasting the little money [I] had.\u201d He was getting annoying, I was just trying to make more friends, so I was going to parties and bars, hanging out with people. When I finally got the courage to ask him about living together, he got all defensive and asked about if this was the plan all along, take advantage of him for a living space that I don\u2019t even pay for. I said I could, but he didn\u2019t believe me, he claimed that it was too expensive for someone living on $10 an hour and not rushing to get a job, he complained about how he was just taking care of me. I got annoyed and asked why he decided to be so mean about this and just said I couldn\u2019t live with him. I brought up that he said he enjoyed it and that he \u201clove[s]\u201d having someone to live with, I couldn\u2019t understand how he was mad. For the last week we have been ignoring each other sometimes he would tell me to \u201cfind a job for god\u2019s sake!\u201d he has become so mean, I don\u2019t know what to do. AITA?",

I texted my sister and asked if I could sleep on her couch because I was shivering. She was angry I disturbed her during exams and said no. I was angry but didn't go to her house. That next morning, I asked if I could take a shower at hers to warm up because I was still freezing. She refused because she did not want to clean the bathroom after me. We argued and I told her she was unreasonable and mean. I eventually showered without her OK and left. I might have been the asshole because I showered without her permission. I also bothered her during her exams when she was very stressed. ",

Since I am an honest person and loyal, I felt I had a duty to show my boyfriend what she was saying. I told him that I am okay with her texting me and venting but that I would show him what was said because I don't hide things from him, but then he texting his mom and said leave my fucking girlfriend out of this, which seems to have made things worse. Usually we have supper at her place every Sunday and Tuesday but we haven't for a whole week because of this. I reached out to my boyfriends mom today and inquired if there was a dinner this week or not and she, not that there has to be, but if there will be, and she replied with, Last I was told was to leave his Fucking girlfriend out of this.  His words, not mine.  Only going to say that things are worse and not better so probably no supper plans for a while.  I'm sorry that this affects you too. I personally do not agree with the comment he made too his mom, because if I am as much part of their family as they say I am, and him and I are looking at a future together, then I should be able to tell his mother myself when I am uncountable with something and I told him I wasn't. His comment was counter productive because it brought me into the fight when the words he said were that he wanted me to stay out of it. I feel like I need to have a conversation with my boyfriend and explain that I didn't like the comment he made to his mother and that I showed him what was said out of loyalty to him but that he needed to be loyal to me and not say anything to his mother because he should trust that I will speak up if I don't want her texting me those things. What will it be like when we have kids and his mother does something I don't agree with? I need to be able to speak for myself. So my question to you all is, AITA for showing my boyfriend the messages between his mother and I and basically making the situation worse or was he for sending his mother the text? I'm not sure what should have been done differently.",

My oldest brother (38M) Derek got a letter in the mail saying that his drivers license is suspended due to an unpaid fine. However, he never got a ticket. Derek looked at where the ticket was issued and the plate numbers and it was not his vehicle. He also wasn\u2019t in the area at the time of the ticket. He called the police station in the area and was able to identify who the car belonged to. The owner happened to be friends with my other brother, Eugene. The police officer that issued the ticket pulled up Eugene\u2019s file and confidently said that he was the one he gave the ticket to, not Derek. I know Eugene does not have a license, so I\u2019m assuming this was the motive for using a fake name. Eugene has been going down a dark path lately. He\u2019s gotten into drugs, has stolen thousands of dollars worth of stuff from myself and Derek, and was even held hostage by dealers, forcing my parents to pay almost $3000 in ransom for owed money. Derek is upset. He can\u2019t go to work at the moment to support his family because he has no license to get there and there are no buses in the area. Now that the police know who it is, they are working on charging him for fraud and arresting him in the next day or so. Derek told me, but asked me not to tell my mother because she is always bailing Eugene out and this time, he wants him to see him face his consequences. I do agree with this, however, Eugene has 4 kids, and I felt like my mother should know so she can remove them from the situation before they have to see their father being taken away in handcuffs. Derek is furious I told her. AITA? ",

We\u2019ve always split the tab via PayPal, but she often forgets to pay me back. Recently at the gym, when I reminded her, she said she was tight on money, so I told her it's ok. But she added: Not that you would relate So naturally, I asked her to elaborate.Now that you've got a sugar daddy, you must have saved a lot of money HUH I reminded her that I\u2019ve only been a full-time student since July, have never dropped out, and care for a chronically ill parent, too. So what if I don't work at the moment? I also pointed out that she works part-time but only spends her money on vacations with her BF. I asked why she couldn\u2019t just be happy for me. I\u2019ve always been there for her through her struggles, including her dropping out of high school and BF problems. I asked her if she's jealous. She\u2019s a shy introvert, while I\u2019m an eccentric extrovert. We both have new relationships. She only told me about her Swiss long-distance boyfriend in December, even though they started dating in August, cause she didn\u2019t wanna jinx it. Explains why she often skipped our gym and dinner dates, as she was often abroad or working retail.  As for me, I\u2019ve been dating my BF since September. We\u2019ve known each other since 2019 through a language app and after months of helping him through paperwork, he got a work visa and moved to Germany. I showed him around and barely two weeks in, he asked me out. I understood her anxiety and stress but she didn't understand my silence on my BF. He\u2019s funny and forthcoming, a bit too clingy but also pretty and protective. I kept the relationship secret because I'm tired of getting lovebombed only for the flirt to turn out abusive & coked up. The way a man treats me is thr biggest social proof to me.  Finally, I broke the news to her, but she was pissed. I shoulda shared sooner, given how TMI and shameless I always am. I said it hurt me, too, so she she apologized, too, for hiding her own relationship and said she's burnt out from retail and her trade/apprenticeship. When she asked how I afford my trips and shopping sprees since I quit my job, I told her my BF paid. She seemed perplexed and mentioned that her BF is rather modern, they go 50/50 but she struggles a lot cause he's an older IT specialist and it takes a toll on her to live up to his living standard. Not to mention the long distance struggle. She visits him since she lives with her mom while he lives alone an has privacy. My BF, on the other hand, fights for the bill, hates my thrifting and feels uncomfortable about visiting me empty handed. He even calls me his little housewife cause I cook for him. I know I could have picked my words better but I'm not a fucking sugar baby, I'm not mooching off of him, considering I treat him like a king when he's at my place. ",

Some of us are learning new skills and breaking into careers while we don\u2019t have to worry about bills. I\u2019ve had issues with my older brother (Jamal, placeholder name) before, but lately, he\u2019s been combative. He talks to our two older sisters behind our backs and seems convinced by them our parents are controlling and don\u2019t want us independent. He\u2019s a pain; he doesn\u2019t say anything bad directly, but he goes out of his way to eat healthily and restrict himself in front of me, making me feel bad about my body and weight. He pretends to be supportive, though. He opens canned beans without our mom\u2019s permission, knowing he\u2019s supposed to ask to avoid a mess. His excuse is he bought it with his own money, claiming he doesn\u2019t make messes (he doesn\u2019t, to be fair). Mom gets mad at me whenever he does this, so I have to tell her, which he doesn\u2019t like since it\u2019s \u201cnot my business\u201d and \u201cthis is a problem between me and mom, not you.\u201d He does the same with eggs, setting aside food for himself to \u201csave time\u201d while working on other stuff, which is unfair. Again, he uses the excuse he bought it with his money, but if I have no money, I doubt he does either. He eats more food than us, but I get the impression he thinks he\u2019s better than us because it\u2019s \u201chealthy\u201d or he \u201cworks out,\u201d spending half his day walking around the house or outside. None of this is good for his mental health, and he never listens to us. After I took a shower, I needed to tell our mother something, so I called her and then yelled her name. Jamal came out of his room, ready to leave, and said, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to bother her over the air purifier. I\u2019m coming downstairs; I can turn it off.\u201d I wasn\u2019t asking about that, so I kept calling her and asked him to open her door. He retorted, \u201cWhat are you trying to pry her off her bed for? You don\u2019t need to bother her over every little thing.\u201d I told him I wanted to tell her something. He opened the door, then walked off. I asked if she was on her bed, and he said no. When I told him to walk inside, he said he had to \u201cbe somewhere\u201d (nowhere). I was upset since he knows I\u2019m trying to get her attention, but he does the bare minimum. I laid this out for him and called him weird for that. He cut me off, saying, \u201cDon\u2019t start this with me.\u201d I reiterated everything and insisted he was weird for not helping. He shot back, \u201cYou barely help me. You can\u2019t be bothered to throw a potato in the oven while I\u2019m outside helping our pregnant sister. How about that?\u201d I reiterated every issue of his while he walked off, telling me this was \u201cpetty and unnecessary\u201d before leaving. AITA  Edit: To clarify, I\u2019m describing how his actions make me feel. He has never outright called me fat; I just don\u2019t like watching him eat the way he does since it makes me feel bad.",

She has recently graduated, started college and a job. I am so proud of her for all her achievements, she is one of the smartest people I know. A few months ago she got engaged to her 6 year long relationship with her boyfriend Rob ( 20 ). I was ABSOLUTELY ecstatic!!! To see her beaming for joy was a beautiful heartwarming thing. He proposed to her around all their friends when they went on a camping trip. How cute, right? She face-timed me to tell me and show me the ring. I jumped up and down and squealed for her hahaha. A few months after she was talking to me about plans for their wedding. They decided to hold off until they both graduated college to officially get married. I think that's a very wise decision on their part. After telling me this, she proceeded to say- \u201cOh btw. Destiny ( 18 ) is probably going to be my Maid Of Honor. Hope you aren\u2019t upset.\u201d I won\u2019t lie, it was like a slap to the face and it did hurt. Her and Destiny became friends when she moved to Maine. They\u2019ve been friends for around 7 years now. It hurt me only because I feel even though she\u2019s been great friends with her, it would make more sense for me to be that since we\u2019ve had a close friendship of 11 years going on 12 now. I didn\u2019t want her to feel I was trying to be an ass or poison the conversation on something exciting, so I kept quiet for now. I waited a month and I couldn\u2019t shake the hurt I was feeling. Since she moved I felt a bit like I was now the \u201cPast\u201d so to speak. I texted Macy- explaining how I truly felt and how I wasn\u2019t trying to create issues, but just voicing my feelings. She told me she was never trying to hurt me but that Destiny just meant a lot to her\u2026.but don\u2019t I as well? She told me I could still be a bridesmaid but it was just the bluntness and putting a friend she hasn\u2019t known for as long in that position that truly just hurt me and made me feel off.  Am I the asshole for being upset about this? ",

At this point it felt like he was low-key trying to brag so I told him dude stop it you don't even sound that good. He asked me wdym and I told him I'm sure she could actually tell he's deaf by his voice but was probably just being kind. He got upset blamed me with being jealous. I had a crush on this girl some time ago. But idgaf about her anymore. I was just annoyed by him humble bragging. I said yeah think whatever you want to, but she prob felt awkward around you and was just tryna be nice and lighten the mood. So quit acting as if she insulted you. He insulted me then told me I'm supposed to be his friend not his enemy. We haven't talked since then. Mutual friends think he was being annoying but I acted like an AH.   AITA?",

        "selftext": "Hey all,I was in a bar last week and I was having a good time with a friend. A lot of people interacted with us and we were all having a good time.  There was a moment where a few girls asked if they could sit with us. For context we were are both males. I did not really talk to their group, other than saying hi, and I was speaking to another girl about university and the states. One of the girls from the group, was flirting with my friend I believe and earlier when they first sat down, my friend asked her what she thought of Australia day, and she said Invasion Day... my parents invaded. I understood the banter, but didn't mess with that, so already knew to not engage with them and avoid them. At a certain point I was just sitting with the one girl from the group and myself, as my friend and her's went to get drinks seperately. We started talking about skincare as she saw my lip balm on the table and made a lewd comment about me having it. I told her so you like my friend and she said yeah but was saying what he was wearing wasn't nice. I asked her if she had a boyfriend and she said she was dating a guy, and I asked if her friends had boyfriends and she said yes, and I said oh it's probably best you don't sit with us, but I hope he pleases you (meant it as treats you well, BUT that is a bit weird to say) you and everything goes well. She took offence and said these aren't your seats and said a few rude things I can't remmeber, I said yes but we were here first this is our land, so you can piss off basically taking a dig at what she said before. About 20 minutes later, a member of staff came to me and pulled me aside. They explained I was reported as making an inappropriate comment to a few females and I had to leave. I was taken aback but said yeah of course, because I know better than to argue as it's a strict policy that bars need to enforce. When I was being escorted out I did explain there was a girl I told to girl to kick rocks when I found out she had a boyfriend, although I had been interacting with men/women all night and nobody had complained. I was pretty much sober as I don't like to drink much. The staff that escorted me out apologised and said they felt uncomfortable doing that to me, and I said that they were being professional and it's fine. They said they would love to have me back but as a hard  policy, any complaint is taken seriously. We exchanged names and that was it. I am 99% sure this was why I was kicked out. Whether something was taken out of context is understandable, and to be honest I should have known better to be rude. AITA for telling someone to piss off and getting kicked out, of was this blown out of proportion?",

The thing is, when everyone is gone and I'm alone in the apartment, I tend to lock the bedroom door bc it makes me feel safer.  Today my roommate was suppose to come back. Well, during the time they were coming back to the apartment, I took a nap after studying for 6 hours straight so i was lowkey drained and completely forgot about the lock door. I'm a pretty heavy sleeper and therefore i did not notice them knocking on the door. They called me once and texted me once but i slept through that. Around 2 hours later, i finally awoken and saw their text. I immediately got up to unlock it and by that time they were hella fricking pissed.

        "selftext": "Pre-COVID, I (31F) was a bridesmaid for my cousin, Diva (34F). Everything was going smoothly until a few weeks before the wedding. Being artistically inclined, I offered to design her wedding invitations as a gift but made it clear I couldn't produce them myself due to financial constraints, as I was handling my mother's medical bills and our family dog's medication for his heart condition. To provide context, I'm an only child caring for a senior citizen (my mother, who is over 70 years old and a cancer patient) and our senior dog. As the wedding planning progressed, Diva approved my designs with some revisions, and I happily submitted them. However, when the actual invitations arrived, they weren't my designs. This was heartbreaking because if I had been informed that my design wouldn't be used, I would have been fine with it, but no one told me. I let it go and moved on. Regarding the pre-wedding parties, I couldn't attend due to my mother's and our dog's medical conditions, which Diva knew about for months and years prior. Despite this, Diva was upset. I couldn't leave my mother, as there was no one else to care for her, nor could she handle our dog, who needed medication and could be aggressive. Hiring help was also not an option due to financial constraints. The Maid of Honor (MOH) got involved, and I kept asking for consideration due to my family responsibilities. The whole family knew about my mother's condition, and some knew about our dog's condition, but I was told I wasn't fulfilling my bridesmaid duties. I had already designed the invitations and helped with bridesmaid dress choices, but I couldn't attend the pre-wedding parties. This led to a feud among the cousins and eventually reached our parents. Days before the wedding, I was still trying to be a good bridesmaid. Hair and makeup were scheduled for 3 AM, but with my responsibilities, I couldn't leave home at 2 AM. I offered to do my own hair and makeup and even negotiated to arrive before the wedding started, prioritizing the ceremony. However, they wouldn't compromise, so my mother and I decided not to attend to avoid further drama. In hindsight, it was a blessing in disguise because our dog passed away on the wedding day, and we were there for him when he passed.",

        "selftext": "/edit apparently i WBTA. I'm not going to give her any notice. I'm going to move out and let her have the place to herself until the lease expires and keep paying it. Part of the reason I wanted her gone is I wanted to leave the apartment complex to begin with. Which would have been useful into to include but I missed that. I met a woman online around 2 years ago.  We'll call her AM. I was 28 M. She was 39 F. She had her own place and I'd go over and hangout with her occasionally ordering snacks, food, etc. Aside from hanging out a few times, we were never really what you would call friends. But this past February I let someone virtually homeless I barely know move into my apartment, simply out of good faith because his job was a two block walk from my house. I didn't want him to have to take two busses to take from work every day. Figured he could save up a few pays and get his own place. I was in the hospital for two weeks and when I got out my apartment was trashed and the guy quit his job. Around this time I invited my friend AM to come stay with me as she was not in a good living situation. Three of us in a 1 br apartment. She helped me kick this guy out. I let her stay for around 2ish months before being told by a potential love interest/another friend of 2 years that I need to kick her out or she would cut ties with me and would never visit my apartment with her living there. i did it without notice, I admit I could have gone about it in a better way. One day we got done shopping at family dollar and when I got back I sat her down in the courtyard outside and told her she cannot come back inside and said I will go back in and get anything she needs to go for the night. Fast forward to October 10th or so, I reached out to AM to see how she was doing. She was at a DAS/mental services facility and said she was being discharged on Friday. I asked where she was going and she said beats me. They suggested she lie about having an alcohol problem to get housing elsewhere but they would have changed her meds in the process and she didn't want that. I apologized for the last way I made her leave as she said this resulted in her being assaulted downtown at gun point. But it's been 3 months. If you factor in letting her stay with me back in March/April. I've let her live with me five months rent free, bought her food, cigarettes and feminine/hygiene products. She has no ID, EBT or SSI/income of any form. She's been thrown in and out of hospitals/shelters since losing her housing 2 years ago.  But im on ssdi/hud. I'm technically not allowed to have guests longer than two weeks, and she has made no attempt at bettering her life or getting ahead in any way nor contributes to the house hold. Today is Jan 7th and I plan on telling her that she needs to be gone, on or by February first. I told myself I'm going to make myself a priority in the new year of 2025. This includes not drinking alcohol, not crying or giving my ex money, and not fostering someone a decade older than me (or anyone for that matter). She uses reddit sometimes and she may see this. I may link her it anyways. #WIBTA",

As a coincidence, we got engaged at a similar time, but I set the date for my wedding earlier and invited her and her partner. She then told me that she is looking at a date just two days before my wedding, so I asked her if she was looking at any other dates since this is hugely inconvenient (we don\u2019t live particularly close and the train drivers have announced a train strike). A couple of weeks pass, and I get invited to her wedding: two days before mine. I\u2019m annoyed at the inconvenience, but ultimately I completely understand: prices/family/availability could mean that she couldn\u2019t find a different day, and ultimately it\u2019s still doable. I told her I\u2019ll make it work regardless (although my partner will not be able to make it as he will be with his family). Some time passes, and she mentions in passing that she\u2019s not sure how she will wiggle another day off (I\u2019m getting married on a weekday as it\u2019s cheaper) as she wants to do a long honeymoon.

Am I being an asshole for thinking she can just make her honeymoon one day shorter to make it to my wedding when I\u2019m making it to hers through train strikes and the huge inconvenience of doing this just two days before my own wedding while I\u2019ll be trying to arrange family/the day in the meantime? To be clear, she hasn\u2019t told me she\u2019s not coming yet, so I\u2019m not going to do anything, but I\u2019m tempted to tell her that I\u2019m not coming to her wedding if she says she can\u2019t come to mine. I know that this is petty and will likely burn that bridge, but I feel like if she values one extra day of honeymoon more than my friendship, while I\u2019ve been pouring a lot of my time and energy into supporting her ever since we met.

We found this fancy pub which attracts a lot of tourists - I\u2019m not one as I\u2019ve been in this country for more than a year now. I\u2019m an expat, Asian (brown). We decided to enter the pub. The bouncer was standing right in front of the entrance. I saw him and made a small head nod with a smile proceeding to walk past (which I do usually with no issues at all, kinda always felt like a bar/pub code) while he was parallely saying something to me in the local language which I don\u2019t speak. Note - he didn\u2019t block the way by any means or hand gestures or there was no queue. In a second, I was aggressively pulled from behind, he snatched my backup and shouted with anger along the lines of \u201cYOU DON\u2019T WALK BY WHEN I\u2019M TALKING, YOU DISRESPECTED ME, THIS IS MY PLACE AND YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED\u201d. I was shook by this manhandling incident and apologised to him that I didn\u2019t understand the language and not meant to disrespect him by any means. He furiously said, it doesn\u2019t matter and I\u2019m denied access. I apologised and returned. Firstly, it\u2019s not a local pub, the name is evidently common across many countries and it attracts tourists - why communicate in a local language? Second, even if that was a miss from my side to not attempt to understand what he was saying or informing him I don\u2019t speak the language, was his behaviour justified or AITA? Note - I was not super drunk or unstable or alarming by any chance, also had a decent outfit for a pub and was let in with a smile by the other bouncer in a different pub. Edit - I went through the reviews of this pub in internet and the bouncers are known for their notorious racial discriminations so it\u2019s not a me issue.

He were working overtime, but it wasn't enough, and I couldn't find a job that paid enough to help. We didn't have family to bail us out, so I was desperate. had already talked with my bf about if I should but I made it seem like a joke. He told me flat out he didn't want me doing that and was super stern about it. So when I did start selling I didn't tel my boyfriend because I knew he wouldn't be okay with it. But I didn't see another way to keep us from getting kicked out. For a few months, I told him my aunt sent me money to help with rent. He believed it and was really happy but last night he went through my phone and found out. We've been arguing about it all day and I feel terrible. He got really mad and said I betrayed his trust. He said I should've talked to him instead of doing it behind his back but if I talked to him he wouldve never let me. I get why he's upset, but I feel like I didn't have a choice. I don't make a crazy amount of money but it's just enough so we van afford our expenses. He said he wants me to stop posting but 1 think should keep posting until were at a better spot. 1 wasn't trying to hurt him or be sneaky I just didn't know what else to do. I know it wasn't the best move, but I didn't know what else to do since we were stuck. Was I wrong to do it behind his back, or was it kind of justified because of the situation?",

For a while now she\u2019s been living off her kids and bullying my gf and today I had enough of the stupid shit. Me and her brother went to the lake today to kick it and talk. While there he smokes his weed. I don\u2019t smoke so I didn\u2019t hit the blunt. When getting back to the house I make sure I spray well. (Note he didn\u2019t spray at all.)  As we come in she says \u201c I better not smell shit.\u201d She comes out the bathroom and starts cusssing at me saying \u201c I\u2019m sick of that fucking smell this ain\u2019t no fucking weed house tf are you doing . ( note my gfs mom didn\u2019t apologize for shit and never thinks she\u2019s wrong.\u201d) I don\u2019t say anything and I go upstairs . SHE COMES ALL THE WAY FROM DOWNSTAIRS  banging on my gfs dooor saying it smells like weed and I\u2019m so sick of this shit cussing at me and my gf. ( note again, she lives with her 7 kids and they all split EVERY SINGLE BILL TOGETHER  that  still includes rent which is 680$ per person. ATP your kids aren\u2019t living with you yall are roommates. She goes on to say I don\u2019t say anything bc yall (gf and her brothers and sisters) pay bills and I say \u201cwell it doesn\u2019t feel like it I feel like it\u2019s fair game if everyone split bills evenly ( she drinks beer like it\u2019s fucking water. I truly think she\u2019s an alcoholic.) she then starts cussing at me and I start cussing back saying who tf are you talking to get tf out my face with that stupid shit basically telling her about her self. Apart me feels like I overreacted but also another part of me is like \u201c you don\u2019t let nobody disrespect you.\u201d So am I the asshole ?  Edit: Also her friends smoke weed religiously. When they come inside they literally smell like a TREE. They even roll up in the house in front of the kids when they get done smoking you can literally smell it upstairs. They don\u2019t spray or anything . Gfs mom never says anything to them about their smell",

        "selftext": "For background, I (16m) am on the autism spectrum and have another related mental illness that causes me to very obviously mirror other peoples traits, movements, catchphrases, etc. I've been working on it in therapy, but it's still an ongoing issue and I'm not making super obvious progress. The process has been slow and I've only gotten a bit better about being independent in my personality.   Today at lunch I was sitting with my normal group of friends (Victoria, Mark, Aisley, and Nicole) and everything seemed pretty normal? We interacted fine and had good conversations. The only notable thing is that I repeated what a lot of them said in silly voices (when we were joking around) and copied this movement that Mark does a lot. He does this thing where he leans forward and wiggles his fingers in peoples faces muttering Do as I say! Do as I say! He's done this for years and I've picked it up since we've known each other. I did it to Victoria and everyone went really quiet. I assumed the joke fell flat and so I just went back to eating. The rest of lunch was normal enough and I didn't think twice about it. We walked to our next classes together and kept messing around in the halls. After that class finished and I was walking to the last class of the day, some girl I didn't know walked up to me and called me a leech and an asshole for making everyone at the table so uncomfortable when I did that movement at lunch. I sat there and just blinked at her, which I assume she took as rude because she stormed off.    When I got home I got my phone (I left it in my room) and checked it. Turns out I had a bunch of messages from Nicole that she wanted to warn me that I might get kicked out of the table. Apparently this is an ongoing issue and they haven't liked me for a while. I asked Mark about it but I think he blocked me? When I asked Victoria about it she said that it was because I kept copying them and it was weird to be around me. I tried to explain that I didn't really mean to creep them out, but that I was sorry and would try to be better. She didn't want to hear it and I guess I'm just... kicked out now? I just want to know if I'm actually an asshole or if I'm valid in feeling a bit upset about all of this. So, AITA for stealing my friends' personalities? ",

Recently the amount of arguments have increased, dare I say I never have issues with anything and am generally relaxed, however sometimes my SO thinks I'm Too chill and don't stress enough (Which I figure would be a good thing? I just don't see a point in stressing because either things can be fixed, or they're out of my control).  Anyway, today we were in the kitchen and I was washing a couple glasses and we were about to make dinner. She needed a small bit of hot water and I turned the faucet into the sink tub closest to her that I wasn't using. I had the temperature in the middle and about middle pressure too as I was only cleaning a few glasses.  I turned the temperature on hot for her, and considering she only needed a little bit I kept the pressure on medium. She turned the pressure on max, left it for a few seconds, put it back to medium, then got her little bit of water. I asked why she did that and she said it Makes the water boil quicker. I said pressure doesn't, it's whether the temperature is on hot or cold and it would have been hot on the pressure it was on when I gave it to her. She said I was wrong but I insisted.  Lo and behold, argument (On her end). I'm a c word sometimes who never believes her (It's a faucet, there's no conspiracy?), she doesn't want dinner anymore, and she's leaving to either go to the gym, or in her words Park somewhere to get away from you.  I'm confused as to the escalation and if I should have just left it. I didn't say anything in a 'Condescending' tone at all. I said it so monotone and normal like it was just basic conversing. Am I the asshole that I should have just said, Okay you're right and left it? Or is standing my ground about the basic use of a faucet valid?  ",

        "selftext": "My (33M) close friend (37m) is a season ticket holder at Dodger stadium and got tickets to World Series game 1, inviting me to the game for his face value. I happily accepted and asked if I could pay him back in installments, which he agreed to, and we had a great time. When the dodgers won the championship, he then invited me to the Championship celebration for his face value and this, being much cheaper, I paid him for immediately. Once again, we had a great time, however, after the celebration we both noticed that the plastic beer cups they gave out after the game were pretty great memorabilia and I saw one near me that I grabbed with the intention of washing it and using it at home. He looked around and didn\u2019t see another and asked me if he could have the one I grabbed. I laughed and said \u201cno, this is mine.\u201d He appeared frustrated, but I then went to search for a second cup for him. In the process of searching, we got separated and we left without the chance to say goodbye.  We live in different parts of the state and don\u2019t talk too often, but a month and a half later he calls me and says he wants to express some resentment he has with me for my behavior. He expresses that he believes I should have happily given him the cup given that he got me the face value tickets to both events when he could have easily made money by selling the tickets on the second market and instead he was kind enough to sell them to me. He was also very turned off by my reaction having laughed at the idea of giving him the cup saying that he felt I was disrespectful. I apologized and said that I intended no disrespect, but also said that I definitely didn\u2019t owe him the cup as I paid the same amount he did and it was his choice to sell me the tickets and not take the profit. He disagreed and we moved on after I offered him the cup because in all honesty, it\u2019s a $5 cup and not that important to me. He declined it saying it\u2019s the principle of the matter. Now I am sitting here feeling frustrated because this all feels like such a silly thing to hold a resentment over. The fact that he had this resentment towards me for a month and a half and felt the need to talk about it so long after the fact just feels petty and it\u2019s hard for me to take seriously.  So AITA for finding this whole situation ridiculous and being frustrated this he feels so easily disrespected over such minor grievances? Also, did I owe him the cup? Edit: I do want to say that I was incredibly grateful to my friend for everything. I paid for parking which was $50. I thanked him profusely. I posted pictures on instagram of us together where I expressed my gratitude, etc. There is an assumption being made that I wasn\u2019t grateful and I was, I just didn\u2019t respond with that for the cup instance. Idk if that makes a difference, but there you go!",

        "selftext": "I had a friend for years. We were great friends, if not best friends to each other. She's the type who HAS to be in a relationship otherwise she thinks she's worthless.  For perspective; she was single for a whole TWO MONTHS once and was claiming no one loves her and she was worthless, life wasn't worth living alone, etc. Going extreme with it. Of course I told her all that wasn't true. Though at the same time I had no sympathy for her because I had been single for years. It was an unintentional, I hope, slap in the face to me. Well, she also had the habit of saying Every Single New Boyfriend makes me so happy! I really found the one! No one's ever made me feel like this before!  After boyfriend number 12 or so, I noticed the pattern.  She got with a guy, stayed with him for a year or more but then, out of nowhere, dumps him and gets with a new guy. Immediately moved in with new guy.  Not her typical move. When asked about it she claimed the last relationship was done long ago, and I morned it months ago. He had his chance to make things right. I finally spoke my mind on this. That she had essentially clung to the old boyfriend because she can't tolerate being single. Instead of ending the relationship and being on her own, she selfishly clung onto him until she found someone else to latch onto. She was offended by this. Claimed I should be happy for her because she's the happiest she's ever been. This new guy has his stuff together, has a car, has his own house. Treats her right for once. I tried to get her to recognize that she has said the same thing about Every new relationship. She somehow twisted this, claiming I said she was happy with her drug addicted ex (that had been, 5 boyfriends previously, I believe) No. When she first met that guy, she said the exact same things. But she's comparing the worst of that relationship with the start of this one. Ignoring the start of the previous one. I essentially told her what she did was wrong and that I don't approve of this decision of hers. I thought it was a bad move all around and worried she would end up in an even worse situation eventually. She twisted this into me wanting her to be miserable and alone. Refusing to accept when I said otherwise. Then we cut contact and I've not heard from her since.  What does the internet decree? Was I the asshole?",

        "selftext": " I made plans with my wife and two friends to have them over for dinner and games on Saturday. Basically it was a double date. I bought new controllers and the newest version of Mario Party so we could all play together. In the morning I cooked and prepped a meal to serve the four of us and left it in the crock pot to cook for 7 hours. Then my wife and I left to visit my nephew who had just made it out of the ICU. I had given my friends a time frame between 5-9pm to come over. We ended up staying at the hospital until 5. The friends (which are a couple) called to let us know they were there at 5. They didn't let us know they were on the way over so we couldnt intercept them and let them know we weren't home yet. My wife told them we would be back in a half hour. They have the code to our home so they could have gone in and sat to wait, but I think they just sat in the driveway for almost an hour. The traffic coming back was horrible. They texted us at 5:45 and said we left. Going on a date instead. And then did not respond to us after that. They're obviously pissed that we were late and maybe feel like their time was disrespected. I told them I was sorry I didn't communicate that we were out and that I wished they could have tried the food at least. My wife offered for them to come back after their date to eat with us but they declined.  I feel like we were both in the wrong here by not communicating our locations. I understand we were late to our own party, but that's why I gave the wide range of 5-9pm. I'm just waiting now to let them cool off and see if they eventually respond to my apology. I felt really dissapointed/sad that I had all this food and my fun night with friends was cancelled, and I'm sure they felt bored and annoyed as they waited.  ********Update********I called both of them individually and told them I was sorry for disrespecting their time. They were both understanding and forgiving. I lost track of time when I was at the hospital because my nephew was starting to walk and talk again after a near death illness. I should have texted them while I was there but didn't realize until it was too late. Neither did my wife. I felt defensive and disappointed that they did their own thing and hoped they would have texted before coming over. I told them a time and they came during that time so they are at no fault here.

Long story short two friends (M28, F28) and me(M27) took a taxi to a friends house to spend Xmas. We live currently in a EU country and the main language is english, we speak spanish as well as us three are latinos. During the ride i sit on the passenger side and mostly check the map and enjoy the view, while answering a thing or two in the convo my friends are having in the back (all in spanish) After we arrived i pay the driver, wish him a merry xmas, 5* review and a tip, but my friends tell me why i did that, that he was a grumpy dude with a sour face towards us the whole ride and didnt even say bye or nothing, that every time we spoke in spanish he would look mean or something (i didnt really noticed or checked him at the time). Me not thinking too much into it i said maybe it was because we were using another language instead of english, and he thought we were talking about him. They said why would we talk in english if he isnt included in the conversation, is not his business and i shouldn't have give him the review or tip. I just said that when in company of other people of different countries is nice manners to speak a common language and they got sour at me for that for a couple of hours, but after they got over it. Still it kept me thinking if they thought i was looking down on them or they were actually right in the fact that it was our conversation. I understand it was not a workplace situation, more of a personal one but for me you should try to accomodate to whatever new place you're living in currently, including having casual conversations in that language. So AITA for suggesting they should speak english?",

        "selftext": "I\u2019ve had a best friend since childhood. We share many hobbies and generally get along with a \u201cyou do you, I do me\u201d attitude. We\u2019ve had great times over the years, but at least once a year, there\u2019s a situation where he gets triggered, leading to a one-sided \u201cfight.\u201d My wife always reassures me, saying, \u201cHe is so silly, don\u2019t worry, he will come back as he always does.\u201d But I wonder if I\u2019m missing something. These situations usually begin with him venting about something stressful or self-destructive in his life. For instance, he often complains about his career and how it\u2019s ruining his mental health. I once suggested he explore other options, which triggered him. He\u2019s a \u201cgrind to get ahead\u201d kind of guy, but I value my peace, so we often clash on perspectives. The latest issue revolves around his addiction to a video game. We used to play it together when we were younger, but I quit because I didn\u2019t enjoy the anger it caused. He\u2019s recently returned to the game and keeps sending me memes and videos about it, despite knowing I haven\u2019t touched it in 8\u20139 years. He constantly complains about the game, yet tries to rationalize it as a \u201chobby\u201d he enjoys. This pattern of seeking validation is familiar. He always wants me to say, \u201cI\u2019m happy for you, bro,\u201d but it never ends there. When he bought a house, I congratulated him, but he wouldn\u2019t stop talking about how expensive it is and how he\u2019s grinding to pay it off. I once asked, \u201cIs it all worth it?\u201d and that triggered him too. Our conversations follow a predictable cycle: 1. He complains (\u201cWoe me and my hard life,\u201d either directly or via memes).2. I respond with sarcasm, suggesting he reanalyze the value of his choices.3. He deflects, saying things like, \u201cI\u2019m not like other people\u201d or \u201cIt isn\u2019t affecting me.\u201d4. I double down, voicing concern more directly, using analogies like, \u201cJust because an alcoholic has gone to therapy doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t still crave alcohol.\u201d5. He gaslights me, saying, \u201cChill out,\u201d or calling me \u201cdoom and gloom.\u201d6. When I point out his deflection and gaslighting, he blows up, accusing me of thinking I\u2019m \u201cbetter than everyone\u201d or knowing \u201ceverything.\u201d In the latest blow-up, he went further, calling me \u201ctoxic\u201d and saying things like, \u201cYou\u2019re the reason you have no friends,\u201d \u201cYou have a stick up your ass,\u201d and \u201cYou\u2019re mentally fucked up, not even autistic or have an excuse, just mentally sick and fucked up.\u201d I told him, \u201cI\u2019m going to let you get this out of your system,\u201d and walked away. My wife, who has witnessed similar situations before, was supportive and said, \u201cWTF.\u201d Now, I feel apathetic and plan to set boundaries: \u201cEither you get therapy, write me a plan for how you\u2019ll change your attitude, or please don\u2019t talk to me again.\u201d I wonder, though\u2014am I the problem?

My argument is that if I would have gave her the doll, it would have gotten ruined with the other ones because she didn\u2019t care enough about them to take them her with her. Fast-forward, we are now in 2025 and I have a daughter of my own. I 100 % believe if my mom would have known she was gonna have another granddaughter she would have left a doll to her. AITA? ",

        "selftext": "Son's birthday today. He's 5 years old. I wasnt there this morning as stay away from home some nights due to work. Even if had slept at home would have left for work before the kids woke. We have a party planned on Saturday, and will be there at dinner time tonight. I realised that my wife gave my son a present this morning. She said it was from 'us. Apparently she does this every year. I was hurt, and told her so. I thought it was selfish that she couldn't wait to share his excitement.  Her excuse is that it is unfair on him to make him wait. find that ridiculous, and believe he absolutely could wait.  I said the only reason to give it early is the selfishness of wanting to experience his joy alone without sharing it. AITA?  Edit(s): This blew up quicker than I expected (I couldn't get online for the last hour). And overwhelmingly with YTA responses, many with some unfair assumptions so I want to add some context in my defence although I think it wont change the general outcome. 1. Today is his birthday, although we have other special plans. Next week I'm taking 3 days off work, two of which are for a family trip and the third is a special day for my son. I couldn't get today off work though, and Saturday is his proper party, which I obviously will be there. I have a 1.5 hour commute each way (hence why I don't normally see him in the morning before he gets up for school), but I normally read the bedtime story when I'm home and I video call EVERY evening that I'm not home. I'm not an absentee father, and I'm not just a sperm donor. 2. My wife has bought most of the presents but not all of them. We tend to put things in gift bags not wrap them. Last year it was me that bought the main present, this year there wasn't a main present, it was mostly a few smaller ones because the family trips mentioned in (1) are really his main present. I don't expect her to do all the gift shopping and give all the ideas, I do a share of it. She does have more free time than me, and does more of the childcare than me. That's a problem of our (shared) lifechoices and not something that we can easily change. My long commute is primarily due to decisions on her part. 3. Yes, she said she does this every year, but first and second birthday are not quite the same level of concious response, and 3rd and 4th I am not sure what she gave him in the morning. As I mentioned, last year I got the 'main' present, and that was given in the evening I am definitely jealous if she is giving him presents. I definitely want to be part of the enjoyment of his birthday.  I was hurt and didn't understand why he had to receive the present when I wasn't there. Yep he's 5 years old, and every family is different. I don't remember receiving presents until the whole family was there in the evening. I thought that was normal, and assumed my wife had the same thoughts. We hadn't discussed it, and I was upset for missing out.I think if I knew, then I wouldn't have reacted that way, but it was a shock and I was upset. I still am jealous and have some feelings to work through. I don't like my work situation and commute, but I really don't see a way to resolve it (without significant financial risk that I'm not willing to take in this climate) so will have to suck up my disappointment. I called my wife selfish for getting the joy, alone without discussing it first, or without giving me the chance to join on video call. I guess I need to take the YTA verdict. Edit(again):Too many comments to respond to, and can't respond for at least a few hours so that I can spend time with my son on his birthday!",

        "selftext": "My (29F) daughter is five months old and goes to a daycare at my husband\u2019s (32M) workplace. My mother in law also works at the same place so she has easy access to the daycare. At least once a week she goes and spends 30 minutes to an hour just playing with my daughter. This rubs me the wrong way for so many reasons. As a mom, it frustrates me that she thinks it\u2019s okay to just drop by whenever without at least saying something or asking (I actually just found out while writing this that she tells my husband but nobody communicates it with me). As a former daycare worker, I would have hated having someone just come in and spend time with a child because now not only do they have infants to watch, but now they have to work around a fully grown woman and make sure that she isn\u2019t taking pictures/videos of other babies as well. I think my biggest issue is honestly that some days she gets to spend more awake time with my daughter than I do and I know that\u2019s a horrible reason to be frustrated with someone but it is what it is. Would I be the asshole if I asked her to stop visiting daycare so frequently? She comes to our house and gets to spend several hours with my daughter at least once a week so it\u2019s not like daycare is the only time she gets to see her.   ETA: Yes. I know I\u2019m the asshole for being jealous. After talking with my husband, I\u2019m realizing a lot of these feelings are based on big emotions from being exhausted and PPD. I don\u2019t hate my mother in law. This is my first and probably only child and she\u2019s my rainbow baby so I\u2019m very protective. For those of you that politely told me I\u2019m the asshole, thank you. For those of you that told me I need to see a therapist, already seeing one for my chronic depression and added postpartum depression so I\u2019m good. I\u2019m going to stop reading comments now and go snuggle with my baby that just got home. ",

        "selftext": "So, a little context: I (35M) am getting married to my fianc\u00e9, Audrey (29F), in a few months. My brother, Steve (30M), has been dating his girlfriend, Lisa (28F), for about a year now. I\u2019ve never really clicked with Lisa, but we\u2019ve always been cordial. She\u2019s kind of loud and opinionated. She also has a tendency to interrupt people when they\u2019re talking, and it drives me nuts. Here\u2019s where it gets tricky. A few weeks ago, my mom mentioned that I \u201creally should\u201d invite Lisa to the wedding, even though I didn\u2019t initially plan to. I told my mom that I was keeping the guest list tight, and that it was more about the vibe of the event. I didn\u2019t think it would be an issue since Lisa and I aren\u2019t close. But my mom started pushing, saying that if I didn\u2019t invite Lisa, it would be \u201csuper awkward\u201d for Steve and that \u201cfamily is important.\u201d I still didn\u2019t budge, and my mom seemed to accept it. However, I was talking to Steve yesterday, and he brought up the wedding. He casually mentioned that Lisa was upset she wasn\u2019t invited, and that it was \u201cweird\u201d that she was left out when she\u2019s been dating him for a year. He said that it would mean a lot to him if I reconsidered. I told him I didn\u2019t want to cause drama, but I just didn\u2019t feel comfortable inviting someone I don\u2019t get along with to my wedding. He got kind of quiet and then said, \u201cI guess I\u2019ll just skip the wedding, then,\u201d and walked off. Now, I\u2019m feeling conflicted. I don\u2019t want to lose my brother over this, but I also don\u2019t think it\u2019s my responsibility to make space for someone who isn\u2019t really part of my life, especially on such a personal day.",

        "selftext": "My 18yo daughter lives at home - as she should since she is not at college or working in a full time job. She graduated high school in 2024 and has a part time job.  She does not drive. My husband and I drive her to work, to her community activities, to hang out with friends, and to dates. She recently asked if she could have 5 people over for her birthday and for a sleepover. We said no. We told our kids that parties are fine through their 18th birthday and for graduation but after that we only have family celebrations. Our reasons: It's a small place and we'd be on top of each other.  After working our jobs all week and juggling her and her brother's activities, we need some calm and quiet. Also, we don't know these kids.  Having them over for a couple of hours is something I can gear myself up for, but an open-ended time of strangers in my space... my heart is racing as I'm typing this.  It makes me super anxious. Daughter knows this (about the anxiety) but has been arguing that it's not a big deal, everyone else does it, and I never have people over.  She has had people over from time to time, but since she and her friends are all dependent on rides, it doesn't happen often. I floated the idea of a 2-3 hour hangout but since she argued with us for about 20 minutes, my husband is like 'nope. not gonna happen. I understand that she's disappointed and wants to hang out with her friends for her birthday. So, reddit, would I be the asshole for not hosting a party for my daughter's 19th birthday? UPDATE 9:55 pm. Some thought provoking questions in the comments. No sleepovers ever? Yes, from around 2nd grade to age 16 we hosted a couple every year - except during Covid, of course.  She hasn't been interested for a few years.  Why doesn't she drive? Lost her driver's license after causing 2 accidents in 3 months.  Thankfully, only damage from the accidents was to the cars; all people involved were fine. However, insurance dropped her and threatened to drop us if she didn't surrender her license. How are you  trying to help her? I've been trying to get her to try for her driver's license again but I'm meeting with resistance.  Talked about the pros and cons of several career opportunities but she doesn't want to have anything to do with it.  Going to counseling, but she seems to use it as a vent session - which can be helpful! - rather than taking the homework and following through with the counselor's advice. Honestly, I know that I need to step up here and take the lead.  Humans tend to do a much or as little as is expected of them; I need to help her raise her expectations. Why isn't she in college? She's not interested in post secondary education right now. She may go back later, and I'm fine with that.  Why doesn't she have a full time job? She doesn't know what she wants to do.  She's currently refusing to look for a full time and I'm not willing to kick her out.  I know a lot of folks do that to their kid when they become an adult, but I don't want to.  I love her and like having her around, knowing she's safe.  Honestly, as a parent I am struggling with how to help her without pushing her away.  ",

We\u2019ve had a lot of ups and downs, we\u2019ve got 3 kids and he has never put in a lot of effort for my birthday (or any other holiday, for that matter). But we\u2019ve worked through a lot this past year and I know he is trying to put in more effort. He told me recently that he was going to pay someone to come deep clean our house as my birthday present. To be fair, I have said many times that I would love to have this done but it isn\u2019t something we need to be spending money on right now so we haven\u2019t done it.  He followed this up by saying that if I didn\u2019t want to spend the money, he would gladly just take the whole day and do it himself. When he told me this, I wanted to be very mindful of my reaction. Again, he has not been in the habit of gift giving or being super thoughtful when it comes to special occasions. I told him that I really appreciated the thought and saw the effort that would take for him to do but if he took the entire day to clean the house, I would obviously just be watching my kids and trying to keep them from coming behind him and messing all of his hard work up and ultimately that doesn\u2019t sound like a present. I felt guilty because I want to praise his effort but I also feel like this \u201cgift\u201d doesn\u2019t feel personal or thought out well, despite the effort. He didn\u2019t seem too upset by my reaction but now I\u2019m afraid he isn\u2019t going to do anything? I\u2019m also feeling a bit frustrated because if the roles were reversed, I would (and have) set something up where he would be able to go do something he loved with his friends and not have to worry about me or his kids.

First he asked me only a couple of random days, but now it is almost dayly. He deliberately puts his phone quite far away from our bed, so he has to get up to turn off the alarm. Now I have to get out of bed to turn it off, and I HATE it... Like I don't even know how to describe how much it annoys and irritates me... I am not a morning person, and he knows this, and I have my own morning routine as to make sure I am not grumpy towards everyone in the morning. But turning off his alarm messes up my routine and makes me really frustrated in the morning. Even more so when he asks me to turn off his alarm on my day off. My bf has his own company and prefers to be early at his office. So his alarm is usually set about 40 minutes before my alarm. But sometimes it is also set 10 minutes before my alarm goes off. He will ask me to 'please turn it off one more time' and then stay in bed till my alarm goes. Now this is where I might be the AH, because the extra time in bed he mostly spends cuddling me and I really love it. Before this all started he used to turn off his alarm himself and come back to bed to cuddle, but that doesn't happen anymore.

        "selftext": "My wife, Emma, and I have a 16-year-old dog named Sky who was recently diagnosed with an aggressive, fast-growing form of cancer. The kind that can\u2019t be cut out easily.  Given this, Sky\u2019s age, and other health issues, the vet didn't recommend treatment. Instead, he's got some pain medication to help keep him comfortable, and we were told to keep an eye on the cancerous lump on his chest.  That lump has gone from pea-sized to the size of a large grapefruit in under two months. Sky\u2019s incontinence is more frequent, and his back legs now give out regularly. He doesn't enjoy playing in the yard or chasing a ball and has become fussier about what he eats. He's also sleeping more\u2014up to 22 hours a day. The vet has said as the growth gets bigger, it's more likely to rupture, which would require urgent veterinary care. At that point, it's likely that Sky would need to be euthanized. It's possible that this could happen outside of our vet's usual hours, which would mean we'd need to take him to the emergency animal hospital. Given all of this, I've tried talking with Emma several times about whether it is still in Sky's best interests to continue on. I think the time has come to have him euthanized. This would allow us to ensure that his passing was as gentle as possible, in a place that is familiar and without the added stress of a medical emergency. The vet has said it's up to us, and he'd support whatever decision we made. Emma thinks that we shouldn't put him down just because things have become harder for us. He does still wag his tail when he sees us and enjoys scratches, but the vet has said that dogs can be really good at hiding when they're in pain, and I think that's what's happening here. Emma doesn't see it that way and thinks that because he's not overtly suffering, we should let him live out whatever life he has left. Also relevant: I work from home, so I'm the one at home with him every day. We've discussed what I should do if something happens and she's away for work. She's told me I should do what needs to be done even if I can't get hold of her or she can't get there. It seems she's accepted that he's close to the end of his life but maybe doesn't want to have to be the one to make the decision to end it? Yesterday, I had a sudden thought that I should just tell Emma that something happened during a time when she's not available and take him to the vet myself. It shook me that I'd thought of it, to be honest. Our relationship is built on a strong foundation of trust, and I know that if I were to do something like this and she found out, there would be no coming back from that. Our 20-year relationship would be over. However, I can't stop thinking about how it could be the best thing for Sky. So, I thought I'd ask the internet: would I be the a-hole if I had my wife's dog put down and lied to her about why? UPDATE: Thank you to everyone who has taken the time to share their stories. I really appreciate all the comments (yes, I\u2019ve read them all) and I\u2019m going to take the advice to continue talking with Emma about what\u2019s best for Sky. Hopefully, I can help her realize that it\u2019s time for us to say goodbye but if not, I\u2019ll continue to support them both as best I can through this difficult process. ",

        "selftext": "I m(32) was sent to the shopping centre on the way home from work to get lasagne sheets for my wife f(35). I went to the pasta aisle and took a look at the lasagne sheets on offer and found one box that stated \u201cno pre cooking required\u201d so I assumed that would be a great option and got it. Today while driving to lunch my wife said to me that she didn\u2019t mean this as an attack but that she had told me to get fresh lasagne sheets, which are the soft ones in the cold aisle. I told her I didn\u2019t hear her say fresh when she asked me or I would have probably figured out she meant cold. I then asked her what the difference was and why it mattered. She said that the fresh ones cook quicker.I responded that it does say no pre cooking required on the box, assuming maybe this was a newer technology and so it wouldn\u2019t be as long.She said that didn\u2019t matter. I then asked if she had used the no pre cooking required before and compared the cooking times to the fresh ones, since we don\u2019t make lasagne much (I can recall one time in our 7 years together) and I wouldn\u2019t think she would have used these before and was making assumptions. She then started to get angry and said that we always get the fresh ones and if she says she w at the fresh ones then that should be it and she shouldn\u2019t have to justify why she wants them, if she says to get them then just get them. I argued that I always like to educate myself and will clarify and ask questions rather than ever just go ahead and do what you\u2019re told, that isn\u2019t who I am and I should be able to ask questions and clarify. At no point did I say I wouldn\u2019t get the fresh ones in the future or that I was right to get the no pre cook ones, I\u2019m just trying to make sure I understand what the difference is and that she has also considered the differences. She then said that the way I was saying it was defensive and right fighting and that she felt I wasn\u2019t listening to her because I was asking all these questions rather than just saying \u201cyes dear\u201d.I continued to explain that I was just trying to understand and clarify, I wasn\u2019t defending that I was right to get those sheets or that I wouldn\u2019t get the fresh ones in the future but she said it didn\u2019t matter because of the way it was making her feel.She wasn\u2019t able to clarify what about my tone or words or mannerisms was making her feel that way rather than just feeling like I\u2019m trying to understand. So I don\u2019t know how to avoid this in the future but not just end up as a mindless \u201cyes dear\u201d robot. Am I the asshole because I tried to understand why she wanted fresh sheets instead of just noting to get fresh sheets next time?",

        "selftext": "I [19F] currently live with my Mum [52F] and 3 sisters [15F, 21F, 31F], but my Mum has made plans to move overseas in the next 6 months with my 3 sisters. She has wanted to move for years as the cost of living in our country is horrible, and she \u2018has nothing left here\u2019 (her parents passed away 2 years ago, and she is single).\u00a0 I was originally going to stay here and rent the current place we live in with my older sister [31],, and my BF [20], but my older sister has since decided that she wants to move with my mother, and that leaves me being unable to afford to live in our current house. I don\u2019t wish to leave as I have my whole life here; I just started UNI, my boyfriend and friends live here and my dog \u2018wouldn\u2019t make the trip\u2019. I am unable to work currently as I am chronically ill and am unsure of how my body would react to both full-time study and work. I get government assistance of $210/Weekly which will be unable to cover rent for anywhere but a single room in a share house but I won't be able to bring my dog. I am left in a position where I would have to financially rely on my BF more than I would like to and would be homeless if we ever broke up. I have brought these issues up to my mom and asked her for a bit more time until I qualify for student housing and can find a nice family to take my dog. However, everyone keeps saying that I am ruining this for her and that I should move overseas with them. She has dreamed of moving for years and is now \u2018able\u2019 to, but especially since her health is degrading, she is losing time to move. Should I give in and leave everything behind or do I stand my ground? EDIT:  Just want to clarify some things. - My relationship isn't new, its 2 years old.  - My dog isn't dying or old, she is just an anxious dog.  - My mom isn't actively dying, she is just getting old and has pre-existing health conditions.  - Yes, I could move to this new country but I would loose the specific program I got into that they do not offer there as well as my scholarship which would put me through Uni.  - I am currently applying to get more government assistance but it would only go into effect after she leaves  - I haven't had a job as my mother advised me not to and originally told me that she would financially support me through schooling  - pet friendly rentals are rare in Australia  - I cannot stay in my current house as the landlord doesn't want a first-time renter staying here.  - My family do not have anything lined up for them in the new place, no jobs, no education, no housing.   - I asked for them to postpone the move until the end of the year so that I can apply for student housing and rehome my dog    ",

        "selftext": "My partner and I live with her mom. She is very gracious in allowing us to live there so we can save money and buy a house. There is however, one complication. We have two cats, and when we moved in we asked that she gets rid of the toxic plants (she had a lot of lillies). Since we moved in two months ago, she has twice brought lillies home. Both times, we just said hey these are lillies can we move them, and she has no problem with that. Another time, she brought home a plant that was toxic, but I can't remember the name and it was shortly after she brought lillies home for the second time. A few days ago, she brought home a new plant that her friend gave her. I assumed that she had already checked the plant to see if it were toxic or not. Today, I looked it up myself and sure enough, its toxic to cats. When I approached her about the plant, I was respectful and just asked something like could you please check to see if the plants are toxic before you bring them in. Her response was saying that she felt attacked, that she didn't do anything wrong, and that because I helped unload her car, I should have seen the plant and looked it up then. (I didn't unload the plant from the car, just her heavy groceries from the trunk). We ended up getting in a heated argument. She was adamant that she did nothing wrong and that its my responsibility to look up the plants she brings in. I don't necessarily disagree, they are my cats and it is my responsibility...and I do look up all the plants she brings in. But after today being the third or fourth time she brought a toxic plant in...I just felt its not unreasonable to ask if she could look it up before hand. AITA? She does have obsessive personality disorder, so maybe her behavior has something to do with that? Or, maybe I'm just an asshole. Edit:  I should make it clear that\u2019s she is not a plant person. She only has like two plants in her house at any given time. She has one on the kitchen window sill( the one her friend gave her), and a bouquet of flowers on the kitchen island. She usually only has the flowers and changes them once a month",

        "selftext": "I (23F) have a friend (24F) who is currently in uni in another country. Her family is pretty strict so being far away from them made her go a little wild. Recently she was ranting to me about how her first kiss experience. She and her uni friends went clubbing, where she drank heavily and got drunk, but not drunk enough to fully black out, being still lucid enough to be aware of her surroundings and actions. According to her, this guy started approaching her, and they ended up grinding and eventually the guy kissed her, and it escalated into a full make out session.  The next morning she immediately regretted letting the guy do that to her and she called me for support.  While she described the story, it seemed like she wanted me to reassure her that the kiss didn\u2019t count or to sympathize with her. However, I found it hard to comfort her, or for sorry for what she experienced,  because firstly she knew her friends that went with her were going to be drinking heavily as well so there\u2019s no one looking out for her and she\u2019s going to be on her own. Secondly, she consented to the guy kissing her at that point (not saying no/pushing him/walking away) and also she kissed him back which was what caused the kiss to become a full make out session.  I knew she could\u2019ve done something because after the kiss happened the grinding continued and she began feeling uncomfortable about the guy starting to touch her inappropriately and so she walked away right away so it\u2019s not like she couldn\u2019t have done anything if she did not want him to kiss her. She just regretted giving away her first kiss to a total stranger who she doesn\u2019t even remember.  I didn\u2019t say much on the call and didn\u2019t offer the reassurance she seemed to be seeking. I felt conflicted because I think she willingly engaged in the situation and only regretted it afterward. However, I wonder if I was wrong for not being more supportive as her friend. I might be victim blaming as well for thinking that she should\u2019ve been more careful and responsible about her alcohol intake, knowing that she has no one watching out for her.  AITA? EDIT: I did not say much on the call as I was in complete shock that this happened to her. I was in no way judging her and I feel really bad that her first kiss (which is something she was looking forward to) was taken away like this. I am just wondering if I am the AH for not showing her the support that she wanted me to ie telling her it doesn\u2019t count as her first kiss. I did not tell her off or voice any of my \u201cjudgemental\u201d opinions I just listened.  EDIT 2: My friend asked me and I quote \u201cIt doesn\u2019t count right\u201d as to whether this is her first kiss experience or not I am not assuming anything.  ",

She's been putting off getting a job for a few weeks (she's applied to six over the past three weeks with no response) so my husband and I decided to put our feet down. We gave her until 8:00 PM to draft us a multi-week plan regarding how she plans to get a job (e.g. how many jobs a week? which jobs? etc.) She gave us a half-assed paper that said, apply to 3 jobs a week. We told her that this was unacceptable, and told her that she wasn't even really trying to get a job. She then asked us aggressively how many jobs\u00a0*we*\u00a0thought she should apply to, and I said that she should apply to 3 a day. My daughter then said, well then how am I supposed to devise a multi week plan if I'm already going to be applying to 21 jobs a week? We said that it's still a multi-week plan, consisting of applying to a total of 42 jobs over two weeks. She got very upset at us and cried and yelled, and locked herself in her bathroom for the rest of the night. It was also her job to do dishes today, and we reminded her with a text about this, to which she refused to do them. We didn't know what to do, and are threatening her with not letting her go to her friends debutante ball and winter formal after party.  I just want her to learn to be independent and prepared with some funds before she heads off to college: Am I the asshole?",

        "selftext": "Ok so I\u2019m really pissed off and disappointed at my bf of 10 years. On Thursday he had to fly from Canada to Jamaica for his grandpas funeral. He invited me to go but decided he wasn\u2019t going to bring me anymore, I was upset he didn\u2019t end up bringing me because he decided to fly with his brothers instead so whatever I had to just deal with it. We have never went on a trip outside of the country without each other so that\u2019s why it was disappointing. I even packed his suitcase and helped him convert money to Jamaican dollars and literally helped him with booking the ticket, even though again I was mad I still did it for him. He specifically told me he\u2019s not going down there for fun, said he\u2019s only there for the funeral and to mourn the death of his grandpa. Tell me why I check his location and he\u2019s at a fucking resort the day AFTER the funeral which is 4 hours away from his grandpas house? When I asked him he told me it\u2019s not a resort, he\u2019s at a hotel. LIES! I google it and it\u2019s a resort in negril, with a nice beach, pools, buffet, LOUD music. Who is he trying to fool? And yes that made me upset because again, he\u2019s there without me and I know he would be upset too if I did the same thing. And LIED about it. AGAIN, I was forced to get over it. So this is the cherry on top of why I\u2019m angry. Before he left to Jamaica, I sent him $200 Canadian dollars to cover what I asked for which was roasted breadfruit, which is hard to find here where I live. I specifically asked for 6 of them which cost less than $5 Canadian dollars. That\u2019s all I asked for. The only reason I asked for that was because I know his mom brings down so much food, she brings more than 6 roasted breadfruits, fruit, a lot of raw fish and bottles of wine and beer. So I know she had no issues going through customs. Tell me why he calls me today, I asked him what he bought me and all he bought me was 1 FUCKING BREADFRUIT. Mind you, I ASKED him and PAID for it so he can make it up to me by him excluding me on the trip. He told me he\u2019s going to have issues with customs and then called me ungrateful. I told him I only fucking asked for that and he didn\u2019t even try to make me happy considering how he excluded me and went to a fucking resort without me and tried to lie about it. Do I even have the right to be angry?? I told him he can keep it for himself and asked for my money back. AITA?Ps the reason I\u2019m so upset is because I have the biggest heart and do so much for him and spoil him and he doesn\u2019t even fucking try to reciprocate it back, I\u2019m not asking for the exact same but at least try. And he fucking didn\u2019t. ",

        "selftext": "An internet mutual and I had the idea to apply to artist alley tables at conventions together, because it's easier to take care of a table with two people (if one has to pee, the other can babysit the artwork).  He has experience as a vendor at Cons and I do not. So I thought he could be my guide and help me navigate all that stuff. I also thought that our chances of actually getting a table would be better because he already had that experience.  We've applied at the end of last year and by now we have been rejected by every single convention we have applied to. With one exception. One convention didn't allow shared tables so we applied separately and then planned to ask the Con to put our tables next to each other if both of us got accepted.   Well, he got a rejection and I was accepted. It's by far the biggest Convention we applied to with the most competition for the tables. And it is his Dream Convention he always wanted to vend at.  The two of us had found 3 more Conventions we'd like to try for before I got that accepted to the big Con. But since I got that acceptance letter I am thinking that I might have better chances of getting in if I apply alone.  I knew from the get go that the products he made were of lower quality than mine but I thought his vending experience would be more important to Cons than the quality of his things (turns out, most Cons don't even ask if you have prior experience and just look at the products).  Why I would be the asshole: Breaking a promise is bad and he has talked multiple times about how he just isn't good enough and about how sad he is about all the rejections. I don't want to add insult to injury.  Why I wouldn't be the asshole: It turns out that his vending experience is limited to small Conventions. It seems like in most cases he was accepted, because all applicants were accepted. I didn't know about this before we decided to share a table. I don't think he intentionally mislead me but I would have made a different decision if I had known.   And for him art is a hobby, for me it's my job. The stakes are higher for me because my income depends on it.  Would I be the asshole if I break the promise I made to apply together and tell him that I want to apply alone?    ",

I love it, and I think I got a great deal. A few days ago, my friend (also 25M) saw me with the bag and complimented it, asking where I got it. I just laughed and said, \u201cIt\u2019s a secret.\u201d He jokingly replied, \u201cDid you get it off the black market or something?\u201d I shrugged it off but told him, \u201cDo I look like someone who buys from the black market?\u201d He seemed to notice the convo was going nowhere, so he changed the subject.

        "selftext": "Last weekend, I had to fly out of town for my brother\u2019s funeral. He was a secret alcoholic and I hadn\u2019t seen him in 5 years. It was a rough trip. They had the idea that he would really like it if we went to an arcade bar and they kept buying drinks. I ended up having 5 voodoo rangers. The whole thing was weird. Because of the flight time and the location we ended up just staying the night at the airport. It was rough. Since I had no one else to help, I asked my best friend (let\u2019s call him Adam) and his girlfriend (let\u2019s call her Sue) to let my puppy out while I was gone.I was only supposed to be gone from Friday at 5 to Sunday at 3pm.  His parents (Mark and Lisa) also helped out. I called Adam and told him the instructions to take care of the pets, but I didn\u2019t leave a written list, which I now realize might have been a mistake. The original plan was for them to take him over to their house since he\u2019s about 3 months old. But Adam  didn\u2019t communicate that with his dad. And then the vet told us he had roundworm so that made it not possible for them because Mark  and Lisa\u2019s dog is old and they didn\u2019t want to risk it. When I got back, the first thing I noticed was that my puppy was in the wrong crate, he was covered in pee, and had chewed up the bed in that crate. So clearly, things weren\u2019t followed how I had asked. That already frustrated me on top of being hungover and exhausted and grieving. But I was too exhausted to deal with it at the time. My wife sent a thank-you text to Mark and Lisa but accidentally left out Adam and Sue. A little while later, Mark called me, asking about it and then straight-up asked if I was mad. The truth is, I was. because they didn\u2019t really do what I had asked. But instead of apologizing or acknowledging anything, Adam immediately shifted blame, saying it was my fault for not explaining things well enough, and got very pissed about me not saying thank you. Then Sue said I was being passive aggressive. Instead of saying something back I just told her that I\u2019d like to keep it between me and Adam because I originally asked him. I did shut her down but I didn\u2019t want her to get caught in the middle. That pissed her off royally though. Now, mutual friends are telling me I should smooth things over because Adam feels unappreciated and Sue feels disrespected. I do appreciate that they helped, but their reaction made me feel like they weren\u2019t being very understanding of what I had just gone through. AITA for not thanking them right away and for feeling put off by how they handled this? UPDATE: So I was going to Clarify on a couple things. 1. There was no neglect and that wasn't the point of the argument 2. I know I was frustrated over minor things. I would have never brought it up if it weren't for mark calling me and asking about it and pushed for an answer. 2. The reason my wife texted was because i was driving home and I fully intended on calling him personally to thank him and even joke around about my frustrations. I gave context in my post as to why I wanted to wait 3. I am appreciative of their help and I told them that when we were arguing, It did come off as not genuine. The whole thing got a lot bigger than I think needed to be and I didn't understand why. 4. I went ahead and talked to everyone and apologized for being frustrated and letting that overshadow my appreciation. Adam is still insisting that I should have just said thank you and bent the knee. The whole interaction I think is silly, but not worth being mad about. Puppies are a handful and he did a pretty good job all things considered.  5. Finally, some of y'all are out there. This was clearly a minor case of who the butthole is and coming at me saying I drank too much or that my wife carries the emotional burden is not needed. I definitely wasn't acting in the best way but I think a little grace is merited. I would really hesitate to wanna be friends with people who would kick you while your down. ",

        "selftext": "Throwaway account for obvious reasons I (F30) got married a few years ago, and for my wedding, I gave my sister, **Victoria** (F28), enough tickets to invite whomever she wanted no questions asked. The only condition was that she not invite one specific person my fiance really disliked. She understood, and it wasn\u2019t an issue since, although they were friends, she respected our wishes. Now, Victoria is getting married. Weddings in our culture are a *big* deal, huge family gatherings filled with food, music, and dancing, where extended relatives, family friends, and even distant acquaintances are often invited. It\u2019s not uncommon to have hundreds of guests, and the celebration is as much about community as it is about the couple. Victoria hasn\u2019t really asked me for input on the guest list, which I understand, she already knows who she wants there. The wedding is still 9 months away, and I\u2019ve only asked her to invite **one** person. Just one. That person is **Alice**, who is incredibly important to me, like a sister. I\u2019ve known her since i was 10, and she even invited Victoria to her own wedding. However, when I brought it up, Victoria told me she hadn\u2019t invited Alice and wasn\u2019t planning to, not because she dislikes her, but because she\u2019s already over her guest limit. She told me to \u201cwait and see\u201d if there\u2019s space later. Her reasoning is that she hasn\u2019t seen Alice in years and that Alice doesn\u2019t know her fiance, so she\u2019s not on the priority list. But what frustrates me even more is that Victoria keeps saying that it shouldn\u2019t matter because she has already invited some of my friends. While that is *partially* true, the reality is that those friends are also *her* friends, she invited them because she wanted them there, not because I asked her to. I even pointed this out and said, \u201cWell, if that\u2019s the case, then how about we swap out a third friend for Alice?\u201d Her immediate response was *no,* because that person is \u201cher guest\u201d and is definitely coming. I know it\u2019s not my wedding, it\u2019s Victoria\u2019s and her fiance\u2019s decision who they invite. I completely respect that. I\u2019m not angry or trying to demand anything, I just can\u2019t help but feel a little disappointed. With so many people being invite, it stings that Alice, who is like family to me, couldn\u2019t be included. Especially when I made accommodations for Victoria at my own wedding **AITA for insisting she make room for Alice?** EDIT: Since people keep saying. Alice has been a close family friend for 20 years. She and Vic even hung out without me many times so they are not randoms. EDIT 2: Maybe using insist was the incorrect term since everyone keeps pointing that out. We only had 1 conversation about this where I said Id like to have Alice in the guest list and she said no, then we talked about it for 5 more minutes before it ended and I asked her to let me know if she changed her mind. Edit 3: I should have mentioned that we are NOT American. In our culture its very normal that parents and siblings get to invite their friends to the wedding and you are usually sat with your guests during the banquet so its not that weird that I asked about a specific friend.

The other, Hannah, has a 4 y.o., Mikey. The baby shower is no kids but since I'm helping with planning and Mikey is family, I told Hannah she could bring Mikey. When I told Stephanie that Mikey was coming, she didn't say anything to me, but later called Hannah and asked if Hannah could find another option for Mikey. Stephanie said it's ok if he has to come but it's not a party for kids.  Hannah called me very upset that her son isn't wanted at the party, so I called Stephanie and told her she's being rude, needs to respect her family more, needs to apologize to Hannah, and should be happy Mikey is coming. She told me that this was between her and Hannah and that I should stay out of it. I said that I'm planning the party, so I don't have to stay out of it (I stayed out of it when Stephanie didn't invite all of her aunts/uncles to her wedding but I'm not staying out of this). She replied that she'd plan the party herself and uninvited me.  I'm just trying to help my daughters resolve their fight and plan a nice party. AITA?",

        "selftext": "My BIL (28M) used to live with his parents, paying \u00a330 a week for rent and food. About 18 months ago, he started spending more time at our place after his parents\u2019 dog turned on him. I offered him to move in with us so he could save enough to move out. My husband wasn\u2019t thrilled about the idea, but I thought it would only be for a few months. EDIT we made the decision together, i didn't go against my husband's wishes we didn\u2019t have a spare room, so set him up in our 11y/o son\u2019s room with a foldout bed. We agreed on \u00a3160 a month, which covered bills/food. However he quickly started complaining about doing the dishes (only chore we asked him to do) and spent his money on nights out and other stuff instead of saving to move out. After a few months, it was clear he wasn't saving at all. When brought up, my husband said BIL had until March to move out, he was shocked by the deadline. We offered until end of August, with rent increased to \u00a3250 a month, which he agreed to. But he would consistently ignore basic requests: keeping the bathroom window open when showering to avoid mould, picking up his dirty clothes, keeping his stuff in our son's room organised and not sleeping in the living room overnight, we spend 80% of our time in that room, it's a family room NOT a bedroom. By august, BIL is no closer to moving out which i KNEW would happen. Instead, he booked a holiday, started saving for that, showing he can save and taking us for complete mugs. Rent went to \u00a3400 a month, hoping that would encourage him to leave because we can't just throw him out. He viewed a place, it fell through, and he blamed his friend- told us WE should be having a go at his friend instead as if WE'RE responsible for him. He\u2019s now been living with us nearly 18 months, paying low rent considering everything is included (even toiletries as he has not bought any since moving in). He works full-time and makes above minimum wage. I no longer like being around him, i find him rude, entitled and arrogant. The tension has caused strain between me and my husband, I\u2019ve tried to talk to him about it (A LOT), but he doesn\u2019t want to aggravate the situation, even though he agrees with me. I\u2019m frustrated because every time i broach the subject i feel dismissed and i just need to put up with it until he moves out, even if it means letting BIL act/talk to me in a disrespectful manner. My husband isn't afraid of confrontation but can't be bothered with it as we're stuck with him in house. As he doesn't back me up BIL doesn't take me seriously and i feel like I\u2019m not being supported in my own home. He's had enough of me going on about it, I've had enough of dealing with the whole thing. BIL is due to move out in 4 weeks-he's moving into his friend's (+ friends gf and 4 kids) attic as he never looked for anywhere, the whole situation has left me emotionally drained. I\u2019m wondering if I\u2019m overreacting or if my feelings are justified. Our friends agree BIL is miserable to be around and I\u2019m tired of the cr*p i'm putting up with, should i continue to let it go over my head?",

        "selftext": "My (26F) parents own the 2-bedroom condo I live in, and my boyfriend (28M) moved in a few months ago. We discussed rent beforehand, and he was fine with paying. I initially told him $1800,  in addition to splitting utilities 50/50. He agreed. For context, comparable 2-bedroom condos in our area (a desirable part of Southern California) rent for around $2800, meaning $1400 per person. My parents aren't charging *me* rent, which is incredibly generous. However, they see the condo as an investment property, and the rent they would charge me is factored into their financial planning. I send them a portion of the rent I collect every month. I also pay the HOA dues and property taxes (which are substantial in California). Everything was fine for a few months. Then, my boyfriend was looking at rental listings and realized that *individual* rooms in comparable condos are going for around $1400. He also found out (from me, I wasn't hiding it) that I technically don't pay rent myself since my parents own the place. He completely flipped out. He accused me of trying to profit off him, saying I'm taking advantage of him because I'm not paying rent. He argues that since I don't have a rent payment, the $1800 is mostly profit for me. He thinks he should only pay half of what *I* pay in combined HOA dues, property taxes and utilities. I admitted that the $1800 wasn't just based on splitting a theoretical $2800 rent. I told him I added a bit extra because I'm the one paying the HOA fees and property taxes, and I\u2019ve been responsible for general upkeep of the place. I also have to send a portion of the rent money to my parents. I acknowledged that it's more than half of what a comparable room would cost. He's not having it. He keeps saying I'm ripping him off and that I should only charge him half the combined HOA, taxes, and utilities. He\u2019s now refusing to pay the agreed-upon $1800 and is only offering what he calculates as his share of the combined HOA, taxes, and utilities. I feel like I'm being reasonable. I'm not trying to get rich off him. I'm just trying to cover the actual expenses associated with the condo. Am I the asshole here? Should I just lower the rent to appease him, even though I feel like I'm not doing anything wrong? This is making things incredibly awkward. EDIT: There is no mortgage. My parents bought the place cash as investment property. I have been living here rent free for about 8 years and have done some remodeling at the time, and have had friends as roommates here and there whom i also charged rent, but usually those cases were when those friends were suffering financially so they paid under market value.  My parents did not ask me to charge my boyfriend rent or for me to send them money, they basically say it's my choice to use the place as I want for now.  I send them 1k a month because technically it is their place and so I feel they should get a share of the rent. EDIT - UPDATE   For everyone assuming/asking if I am pocketing the money. NO I AM NOT.  It;s like this:  I send 1k to my parents since it's their place, and every time I've had a roommate I've sent them a portion of the rent without them having to ask. BECAUSE they bought this place as an investment property. I was originally going to fic it up and rent it out but stayed longer than I planned and they have never charged me rent. So I am holding them back from it being a full time rental property so of my own initiative I am sending them rent whenever I have roommates before they can ask me for it.  1k to parents $500 - HOA dues  $100-150/mo utilities Property taxes - somwehere between 5-10k/year So I'm usually left with $150-200 every month after paying my parents and HOA and utilities, and even combined over a year it would still not cover even half the property taxes, which I am willing to keep covering fully myself.   I am not pocketing anything or making any money from what I charge my boyfriend for rent. ",

The law in my city states we get 2 free months of rent in these situations. (15K in our situation)  But the new owner wants us out faster than that and offered us $30K to be out at the end of the month. We took it but now we have to divvy up the money. My thinking is we should take the first 15K and divide it by what we pay for rent normally, then the extra 15K on top will be split evenly 5 ways.  Everyone else thinks we should split the entire 30K by how everyone pays rent. Which i think is ridiculous, because that extra $15K was never part of the plan. No one should be entitled to a percentage of something they didn\u2019t pay into? They\u2019re thinking about it like a business, an investment. But rent is a bill, not a business. That extra money came about purely bc of a situational issue, not bc more money was \u201cinvested\u201d I feel taken advantage of by my friends and even my own boyfriend.

        "selftext": "Hi so currently I\u2019m in a situation and I\u2019d like an outside perspective as my family think I\u2019m an asshole!! Sorry in advance if there is any spelling mistakes and punctuation errors, I\u2019m typing this fast as my wife is getting our daughter ready for bed. So I Adam (19M) is married to Keeley (19F) and between us we have a little girl Iris (3F) turning 4 in a few weeks. Keeley and I got married last year after being together for 6 almost 7 years - we got together at 13 and we have been friends since the age of 10 . During our entire friendship and beginning of our relationship Keeley had no minim/ non existent relationship with her dad - he pretty much abandoned her and her siblings and from what she\u2019s told me over the years, he was an absent father throughout her entire childhood. Keeley\u2019s mum met her step dad when Keeley was around 6, and from then on her dad became even more absent and when he would have her and the siblings, she would be the one looking after everyone when only being the middle child. During last year\u2019s wedding preparations Keeley\u2019s dad wanted to walk her down the aisle on her wedding day. I didn\u2019t see the problem with that but Keeley was set in her ways and told me and her entire extended family that her step dad was going to walk her down the aisle and if anyone had a problem with it they would have been uninvited to the wedding. Fast forward to now, I\u2019ve been meeting with her dad, we will call him Ben (46M) every couple of weeks to catch up and update him on how iris and Keeley is getting along ( iris is in nursing and Keeley is going to uni in September to be a nurse). This week when I met up with Ben he expressed a desire to get to know his granddaughter as he said \u201che doesn\u2019t know how long he\u2019s got left) let me preface this by saying Ben has tried to use this tactic over the last to get Keeley to talk to him and as Keeley told me he used this as an excuse when she was kid, when she wouldn\u2019t do something he wanted.. but I don\u2019t know if he is being honest or if he is actually gonna die soon. I guess I want Keeley to talk to her dad, as I didn\u2019t have a dad growing up, my dad died when I was 9 years old - that\u2019s the reason we moved and then that\u2019s when I met Keeley. He wants me to bring iris to our meet ups or ask Keeley to hear him out. After the conversation I went to my mums house to ask for advice and she said i definitely shouldn\u2019t bring up this up to keeley and to stop meeting up with ben. I\u2019m considering just telling keeley everything and dealing with the fall out afterwards.So Reddit, Would I be the asshole if I asked my wife to talk to her dad? I don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t think of this but this is the only relationship I\u2019ve ever been in and I\u2019m actually super close to her step dad.  Edit - hello everyone! I just want to say thank you for all the comments and messages I\u2019ve received. Firstly, I wanna address people this story and account fake - I can assure you it is not, this is my real life and the account is a burner account as I do have a normal Reddit account and I have done since I was 15 Keeley just follows that one so I had to make a new one to address this matter. Secondly, people saying my story doesn\u2019t match up with our ages, we had our daughter at 16, which is almost 4 years ago, I turn 20 on the 16th January and then iris turns 4 on the 25 of February and then the following month Keeley turns 20. Keeley is starting uni in September as she took some time out of education to be 100% present for iris first 9 months that\u2019s the reason she is going. Also when I say iris is in nursery, I mean it\u2019s like a play group thing she goes to everyday, my mother in law takes her for a few hours while I\u2019m at work and my wife is at college. I just also wanna preface this by saying No, iris was never planned, we never planned to have kids till at least our twenty\u2019s, but when we found out Keeley was pregnant we had a long talk and decided that we both could do it and she\u2019s an amazing mum. In the last 3 years Ben has had nothing to do with Iris - as some messages were saying - and it wasn\u2019t due to my wife\u2019s lack of trying, he didn\u2019t want have that relationship with her. Lastly, after reading through all you\u2019re comments I can clearly tell I\u2019m a huge arsehole, Keeley has no idea I\u2019ve been meeting with her father and as some of you have said it\u2019s a huge breach of trust which is completely is. A lot of you are saying that he is using the situation with my dad against me and I never thought of this until it was mentioned. When thinking back to our meetings I can definitely say this is the case, him bringing up how, he thinks that my relationship with my dad would be now or how my own fathers relationship with my daughter would be. The people saying that this is a reason for Keeley to leave/ divorce me is a bit far fetch, Keeley is an understanding woman and she would never do something like that unless it was absolutely necessary. I\u2019m writing this on the way to wok. Tonight when I get him I\u2019m gonna to show Keeley this post, comments and all the messages I\u2019ve received and we shall go from there. I wanna say thank you to everyone who took the time to read this post, even tho I\u2019m a hide asshole. ",

        "selftext": "I 40f and my husband 42m have two wonderful kids 10m and 7f.  Our kids have never been the best of friends or even got along that well most the time, they would bicker and argue with each other call each other names and do things they knew annoyed the other to purposefully get under their skin.  I don't want to go in to detail but we've had some financial issues lately that caused a bit of a strain on our marriage, we would argue a lot late at night when the kids were in bed and often wouldn't go to bed ourselves until 2 or 3 :am ( even when we had work the next day).  I'm ashamed to say that it turns out our kids would often wake up and hear our late night arguments and this actually gave our daughter nightmares, I found this out when I went to wake my son and saw his sister in bed with him, that's when he told me she had a nightmare and got in bed with him because my husband and were still up fighting.  This broke my heart to know we made our daughter scared and weren't  there to comfort her,  we made sure to keep our arguments as quiet as possible and reasured our daughter that sometimes mommy and daddy fight but she didn't need to worry about that and everything would be okay.  We kept our arguments to a minimum and were as quiet as possible, but our daughter still had nightmares the next few nights and got in bed with her brother.  We were able to get a handle on our financial issues and stop fighting so much. We reassured the kids that  everything would be okay and that they didn't have to worry. After a few nights our daughter was back to sleeping in her owne bed.  Ever since then our kids have gotten much closer, they play together, watch shows together, goof around together, and treat each other with much more love and respect then they used to. They even hug each other goodnight every night.  They still have arguments and bicker but it's much less and they  have an overall very loving relationship.  Today my daughter drew her brother a picture of the two of them playing in our yard with the words  best big brother in the world written really big on top.  My son loved it and showed it to us and asked if we could have it framed, as I mentioned we have been having financial issues lately and I really don't think we could afford to frame it.  I told him he didn't need to frame it, he could just hang it up on the wall. But he said he wanted to frame it because special pictures get framed and this is the most special picture he has. I tried to tell him gently that we can't afford to frame it but he and his sister are still upset.  I asked my husband about it and he said maybe we should get it framed because it's so special to our son and there new found closeness could maybe be hurt by us refusing to frame it.  The last thing I want to do is hurt there new close relationship but I still don't think we can afford to get it framed.  AITA? Edit: We went to Walmart and got our son a frame for his sister's picture, we put it up on his wall right across from where his bed is and he absolutely loves it!  We're very glad his relationship with his sister is so much better and seeing her picture for him everyday means so much to him. We're so glad we were able to get a frame for him.  Some of you seemed to get the idea we were just cheap or that we just didn't want to spend money on the kids, that's absolutely not the case. The kids have lots of toys, their owne bikes and phones and of course all the essentials.  My husband and i didn't realize that there were options for cheap picture frames but we were delighted to find out there were.  Thank you all! ",

In a hasty decision to have everything settled, I kept the division of property and debt as simple as possible - I take care of my credit cards, she takes care of her credit cards, car and car loan. (If it matters, we're divorced in Nevada, US). Years later, I filed for bankruptcy because I was struggling to pay the debt (about $15k) we accumulated together. As stated in the divorce decree, she is responsible for the car and car loan. However, I am primary, and she is co-signer. Both of our names are on the title and registration. Eventually, I know she'll need something from me like a signature for the car. She refuses to refinance because she doesn't want to meet with me. Mutual friends have been saying I should have collected money from her for partial amount of the debt. I don't have as good of a job as she does now.  WIBTA if I asked for money to settle the car situation? Is this even legal? The debt covers some furniture in her home, along with fast food, trips we've done together, ect. We were reckless young adults. I've learned my lesson.",

        "selftext": "For context, I have been with my girlfriend for 11 years and I turned vegan 3 years ago for ethical reasons. Before that, I was not eating a lot of meat, but I knew that I was not really doing the best thing (ethically). I was not vegan because I did not want to create any friction with family, friends, etc. but at some point, I decided to go vegan. For me, it doesn't make sense to kill/harm animals when I can just buy a can of chickpeas or buy some tofu instead. My girlfriend understands this and stayed omnivore, because she doesn't want to give up on things that she loves to eat. We live together so, me switching up to veganism obviously impacted her since we cook together only vegan/vegan adaptable meals. She sometimes buys cheese, milk, chicken and fish that she cooks for herself. Other than being vegan, I have a full time job and have many hobbies that take a lot of my time (competing in Ironmans, learning multiple languages, etc), so it is a struggle to spend a lot of good quality time with my girlfriend. Anyway, on her birthday, I came late from work and I went to a restaurant where they make some Poke bowls. I wanted to make her happy and knew that if she was with me, she would order the salmon poke bowl, but I ended up ordering a vegan Poke bowl anyway, because I did not think her birthday would justify me spending money on an industry that I really don't want to encourage. I felt that even tough it would no be her choice, it would still be a nice gesture. When I came back home with the vegan poke bowls, she was disappointed and kind of angry at me because she knew exactly what went in my head when I bought the bows. She felt that even on her birthday, I could not do any compromise and think solely about what she wanted. She says that even when I give something to somebody else, I don't put myself purely in their heads and that I always filter my actions based on MY standards. What do you think ? Edit : Thank you for all your comments. I am a selfish a*hole and definitely have to work on being a better boyfriend and a better person in general. My girlfriend is a wonderful person and I mistreated her. I will put myself more in her shoes next time I want to treat her and put myself and my standards out of the way. ",

I thought this happened naturally, (not hanging out as much / not talking over instagram etc.) but she felt hurt by the distance. We \u201cbroke up\u201d over text after the she sent l an incredibly long \u201cwhat did I do?\u201d to which I responded in summary \u201cnothing really, I feel like we\u2019re just in different parts of life. I wish you the best though!\u201d I realize now this text was the opportunity she wanted to launch into a diatribe of all the things I did wrong in the relationship and that she felt offended by. I had NO idea. One of these things was a miscommunication about driving to the airport. (A year and a half ago!) She messaged me in August 2023 about driving her to the airport at 6 in September. I said sure, even though this is something that I would not normally ask of a friend (I would ask my mom for or get an uber. Gas is expensive!) but I thought \u201cwell, she doesn\u2019t have a lot of family here\u201d so I said sure, you can get me a coffee and we\u2019ll call it even. I\u2019m a morning person so I figured she was asking me to drive her at 6 am. If I had known she meant 6pm I would have not agreed in the first place.  So flight day arrives and I roll up to her place at 6. I call her. Dial tone. Finally I get a hold of her and she says that the flight was at 6pm. We both apologized for the misunderstanding. I go back home to bed. I get up for work and am feeling (understandably?) tired and a bit grumpy. I send her a text saying \u201chey, I\u2019m not upset at you, but I am a bit grumpy about this miscommunication and am going to have to politely decline to drive you at 6pm tonight to rest\u201d I gave her notice and she replied \u201ctotally fair, I\u2019m so sorry for the mix up!\u201d and she sent me a starbucks giftcard for my trouble, which was a sweet but totally unnecessary gesture. She got to the airport, I wished her a nice vacation, and we caught up when she got back. I thought all was well.  Folks, all was not well. She had apparently held on to this resentment as \u201cI broke a promise\u201d to her. She said me cancelling was selfish cause she couldn\u2019t afford an uber and was shocked that I didn\u2019t rearrange my schedule to drive her at 6pm. She apparently had to take a bus and then get another friend to drive her \u201cwho dropped everything for her\u201d. She was flabbergasted that she \u201csent me the giftcard and then I cancelled! WHO DOES THAT?!\u201d Apparently I didn\u2019t prioritize her and didn\u2019t care about her feelings and wellbeing as I knew how much this trip meant to her. I looked back and she sent me the giftcard after I declined to drive her. I thought it was a nice gesture at the time, but now I feel like she felt like I owed it to her to say \u201caww, since you got me coffee I WILL drive you now\u201d. I thought this was a simple favour that I could revoke cause circumstances changed and not \u201ca promise\u201d. I am doubly confused cause she said over text that it was fine at the time. Am I the asshole for not realizing this was a dealbreaker? ",

He asks me if we would be able to share the machine and alternate between sets. I politely declined and had not specified any reasons as I did not want to come across as rude.

(it was a little before noon but he was told a week before when and what day) He had to go to one of his younger kids school to have birthday lunch with her which was fine I said we could do it after, but his now girlfriend ( not my mom) said I was trying to ruin her daughters bday and I was an asshole and must of planned it. So he hung up called me back and asked if he could do it Saturday, but I had to stay at a family friends house to watch their dogs and so I said that was fine and I would send him a picture of how I wanted it since I couldn't be there to help him or do it myself. Well he had got there threw it in my room not at all how I sent him and my roomates family had to do it because they felt bad.  I was upset more because they had to do it and I didn't say anything to him about it and still thanked him for doing it... but my coworker said I was an asshole for trying to make him  set up my whole house and I was being entitled. I feel like considering I had it all planned for him but he forgot about it inconveniencing me and then I couldn't be there I was in my rights to be frustrated with him... So am I the Asshole?  edit-  I feel like people are coming at me because I started a fight with him or something but like the the oh post I thanked him for doing it and offered gas to which he said no to, I didn\u2019t argue with him about it but I feel I should still be able to be upset that he didn\u2019t do it when he said he would and told my roommate and her family he knew how I wanted it but didn\u2019t care to do and said I wouldn\u2019t mind in left.  obviously I do mind and he didn\u2019t put like pictures or thing small things like that for me up he just had to put a bed and my desk in there and that was it.

Immediately after he passed, I updated the ex and asked if he had any belongings at her house (he had family heirlooms, tools from my deceased grandfather, etc.) She told us she had thrown away his things and anything he had left was hers, since she had bought it.  Every other month, she sends me drunk messages demanding ashes and insulting me when I say no. She has never once expressed sympathy towards me or my mother.  I am done with the messages.

We planned a huge brunch for our friends to ask them to be a part of our wedding party back in March of 2024. Everyone of course said yes, however, as time went on, a groomsman needed to back out so we needed to backfill the position to make it equal for our wedding party to walk down the aisle. Of course, it didn't bother me that my brother-in-law was not initially asked because my finance does have a lot closer friends that he has been friends with for years and we hang out with every weekend. When going over who my fiance was going to add to his side of our wedding party, he mentioned asking another friend of his, I told him it should be my brother-in-law and not his old best friend. Some background, my fiance and my brother-in-law are pretty close, we see him and my sister quite often as my sister is one of my best friends, and our kids (6) are the same age and hang out all the time. This friend that my fiance wanted to add to his wedding party was a really good friend of ours when we first started dating, he and his now finance were some of our best friends that we hung out with every weekend, however, we stopped hanging out with them both for about two years as the friend would make comments about me being a stay at home mom and living off my finance. Me and my fiance both agreed that I would be a stay-at-home mom while I finished college. Fast forward to today, we reconnected with our friends and after a serious apology from my fiance's friend we started to become a part of each other's lives, We only see them maybe once or twice a month, so I was confused as to why my fiance would want him in our wedding over my brother-in-law. I understand that they were best friends for years, and this is his side of the wedding party but my brother-in-law has always been there for us and never has done us wrong. So am I the asshole for asking my fiance to have my brother-in-law over his old best friend?",

        "selftext": "I (28F) live with my boyfriend (28M). I work a state govt job that keeps me out late while his job in IT is flexible so he works from home sometimes. We have been dating for a couple years now and recently he moved in with me. I bought the house and pay the mortgage for it entirely. My BF does not pay me any rent since he is currently in a low paying job and actively looking for better options. However he also has the longer commute to work so he pays more for gas now ever since he moved in because previously he lived closer to his workplace. Until he finds a new job, he told me he unable to contribute for the mortgage and hasn't asked to be on the deed either. He does however pay half the utilities and half of the groceries too. He has been extra conscious about not contributing to the mortgage or paying any rent. Since he doesn't pay rent, he tries to make up for it by doing almost all of the cooking for both of us. He also does the laundry and dishes most of the times without complaint. And when I ask him for help cleaning the house like mopping the floors, he helps with that too. He also packs my lunch every morning to save me the trouble of getting up early. I am really lucky that he does all of this. However, he does make a mess (kitchen and bathroom) and his cleaning isn't as good as when I would do it. We also buy a lot of groceries which we have nowhere to put since the house is somewhat small which makes the house a mess again. I didn't have this problem when I was living by myself so it has started to irritate me quite a bit over time. This past weekend, when he was cooking, he happened to drop rice and some sauce on the floor and hadn't cleaned up after so I told him you need to be more careful about dropping things on the floor cause you make a mess sometimes. It caused him to get upset and he started profusely cleaning the floors. Then he proceeded to tell me I know this is your house, but it feels like I need to tiptoe around you here because I am not keeping the place exactly how you want it. I make a mess sometimes but I always clean up after. Might not be immediately but I do get to it and I do my best. I'm sorry that isn't good enough. And this isn't the first time you've said this. He told me the other time this happened was when he was cleaning out our oven and while scrubbing the burnt bits, it dropped black spots all over the white floor which irritated me. And apparently I had told him that he didn't do a good job cleaning the floor one time when I had asked him to do it. After he told me all this, I got upset because and started crying and he spent the next hour consoling me. I am neurotic about keeping the place clean - especially my kitchen since I have had a rodent problem. Ever since this, I have always found him on all fours on the kitchen floor trying to find every last speck of food because I feel like he is convinced that I would get upset again. AITA for telling him he made a mess in the first place and wanting to keep my house clean? EDIT: Clarified being on the deed EDIT 2: I deleted all my replies to the comments because I kept getting downvoted on every single one. I don't understand the downvotes to my replies when I have only thanked the commenters, been civil with my replies and taken their suggestions as good ones and agreeing to make some changes in myself.

        "selftext": "I broke up with my ex three years ago, but I still had a teddy bear from him. I didn\u2019t take it with me when I moved to the city where I study, I left it at my mom\u2019s house. Since it was fluffy and comfortable, she started sleeping with it every night. After spending a year abroad, I came back to my hometown for a month. Every time I saw that teddy bear, it reminded me of my ex and the moment he gave it to me, so I decided to throw it in the fire without asking my mom. I didn\u2019t think she was that attached to it, I only considered that I didn\u2019t want anything from my ex in the house anymore. Three days later, my mom asked about the teddy bear. When I told her I had burned it, she got really emotional, even to the point of crying. She said she had slept with it every night for the past three years, that it was really comfortable, and that it helped calm her breathing and anxiety. I genuinely hadn\u2019t considered how much it meant to her. I told her I\u2019d buy her a new one, but I haven\u2019t been able to find the exact same one yet. AITA for burning it without asking her first? EDIT: It was not just the teddy bear that I threw, it were all the things I had home from him, and not because I am angry at him or not moved on, but I did not want to have them anymore. I only mentioned the teddy bear as my mom was attached to it, thing I was not aware of.",

        "selftext": "Both me and my friend, Jane, go to a really competitive high school--but because we're friends, we never let it really get between us. We both even applied to a lot of top scholarship (QuestBridge, Gates, Coca-Cola, etc) and made it to finalist stages for QuestBridge together. In December, Jane matched to Duke University and only had to pay $10,000 over the course of four years. I did not get matched, so I did not receive the scholarship, but made finalist for the Gates Scholarship. This didn't tear our friendship apart but instead brought us closer--I was sad, of course, but I was happy for her. Fast forward to earlier today. She heard back from another big scholarship, and I told her to rescind her application as she already has QuestBridge. She did. Then, she heard back from another, and I told her, again, that she didn't need the money and to leave the opportunity for someone else who did. A couple hours passed, and she comes up to me asking for help with her essay, and I look at it with her. Then, she tells me that it was highly inconsiderate of me to tell her to rescind her applications, especially because I knew how much she needed it. At this point, I had taken two exams back-to-back, and was fed up w ppl. So I told her how it wasn't fair for people like me who didn't get matched, but deserved the money just as much as her. She then says how they have medical bills back from when her mom had cancer, and that it wasn't fair to her family that they pay for her school. I said that she could take a job, both during the summer and in college, so that they don't have to pay for her, but she stormed off. Now, I'm scared that I ruined our friendship, especially with something as small as this.  So, AITA?",

        "selftext": "My husband just received a promotion/new job offer at his job. His place of employment has historically not been a positive place and has been the cause of deep stress for him and strain on our relationship; however, it was recently bought out so company ownership is different and this new position would be kind of a fresh start. He let me know about his new position after he accepted it yesterday. He said that he cares how I feel about it and that he knows it has been rough but he thinks this will be a good thing. I do have mixed feelings, but I am incredibly happy for him and proud and I let him know that. I let it sit and gathered my feelings about all of it and then tried to talk to him about it today. I told him that I am happy and excited for him and that I want to support him in this, want to ensure we respect each other\u2019s feelings, and communicate so we can move forward positively together. He lost it. He said that I hate his job and will never be happy, that he does not want to discuss it - ever -, that he should not have to be my therapist and talk to me about it\u2026 the list goes on. I repeatedly told him I am happy and that I am not upset or angry and that it was a conversation about moving forward with mutual respect and positivity and I did not understand why he was angry and asked if he could tell me what he is upset about so I can try and understand. He could not tell me and just kept saying he never wants to discuss it and that I just always cause problems and am never happy. I am at a loss. I told him I apologize if I miscommunicated somehow, but I literally just wanted him to know that I support him and that even though it has been tough there I want us to move forward supporting and respecting each other (that is the text I sent him verbatim). AITA here? ** update - the stress and strain I refer to is that he has been so stressed he has stopped taking care of himself, going to workouts (which he loves), being angry at everything and snapping at everything all the time. He knows he is doing that and apologize saying he is sorry and that he is just stressed and needs to find a new job because he can\u2019t take it, feels disrespected there, and feels terrible for taking it out on our family. So it has affected our family. ",

She TEXTED me I don't feel anything for you like someone in a romantic relationship would. I think our relationship changed and i lost feelings.  I tried to understand why she lost feelings, asked her what she wanted to do. Take a break? End things completely? She would ALWAYS tell me i dont know.  Every question i asked her she would say that she didnt know. We were in this situation for like 3 days, i wanted answers, a reason why she wanted to leave me, what she wanted to do from here, but i got none.  Eventually i got fed up and told her I need an answer, you cant just fool me around, i deserve to know what you want to do and why you wanted to do it.  Mind you, this is all over text... we live 20 min away from each other but okay. She finally said she wanted to break up because she thinks no one can re-gain feelings for someone which i dont agree but thats not the point. Now that you have a backstory: would I be the asshole if i asked her for some expensive gifts i gave her?  I spent a lot of my money that I made working my ass off in sound and music production. I don't have a stable job, just little ones that i get offered from time to time because im also in college full time.  I gave her a lot of plushies and sylvanian families that she loves, which cost a lot of money... so i kinda want to ask for them back so i can sell them. I dont know if this is an asshole move.

She had her big birthday 4 day ski trip cancelled because of weather and is pissed because she had been planning it for a while. She made a big deal out of it because in her eyes she never got to celebrate anything. We went for a meal and karaoke but she didn\u2019t feel like it was enough of a celebration.  Tbh our family isn\u2019t big on celebrating anything but my sister kind of brought it on herself. My sister put a lot more pressure on herself when she was younger because everyone told her she was a genius. She skipped grades and graduated high school at 16. She didn\u2019t attend prom because she was younger than the other students so even though she was a senior she hung out with student her own age more so she didn\u2019t have friends to go with. Plus if I remember correctly she had AP exams afterwards so she spent that night studying because at that point she needed an A in every subject. She always says it was her biggest regret in life. Our parents didn\u2019t put that on her she was just over the top back then. I think it\u2019s overblown because she is very successful now in a job that\u2019s hard to get into so it\u2019s not like her hard work wasn\u2019t rewarded. Tons of people work hard without much to show for it which is worse.   She was complaining to me constantly about her 30th being ruined and said she only has her wedding to look forward to now (she isn\u2019t engaged yet but probably will be this year). I told her she shouldn\u2019t put so much on the wedding and it\u2019s just an expensive party which she can afford yes but it\u2019s still a lot to be putting on a single day. She said it\u2019s her last chance to celebrate something and all the achievements she had has been pushed aside to make room for the next thing and she wants her wedding to be memorable like her 30th was suppose to be but in a good way. She mentioned again skipping prom as an example and I told her that skipping prom to study is kind of a humble brag but more so it\u2019s not a big deal. I went to prom and honestly it wasn\u2019t that interesting, I get she missed it and it sucks but she has way better things in life rn. She got mad and said I got a lot more things celebrated than her so I don\u2019t understand what it\u2019s like to go back and realize there isn\u2019t even a single photo of the event. I\u2019ve texted her a few times since and she just replies with one word answers and I just wonder if she\u2019s overreacting or I\u2019m the asshole here. ",

On top of that, each of us has saved around $3,000 from birthday money saved for future expenses (such as university) I\u2019m considering withdrawing my $2,600 so that if our dad\u2019s money ever runs low, I won\u2019t have to dip into my own hard-earned cash.

        "selftext": "So me (18M) and my girlfriend (18F) has been together a just over a year now, and we both have eachothers phone passcodes. Early on in the relationship I've established that I don't agree with obsessing with celebrities or saving videos of someone you find attractive on social media if you have a partner - she agreed and didn't have a problem with this. A couple times however I've found her doing this. One time she thought I was asleep, she was on her phone and I saw she had a bunch of thirst traps saved (all of the same actor). When I pretended to wake up she deleted them as quick as she could which I found very odd, because now it seems she's trying to hide it. That was half a year ago, but yesterday whilst she was sleeping, I went on her Tiktok. Initially I went on it to troll a mutual friend of ours, I was going to send them a silly message but then I saw that my girlfriend had been sending this friend thirst traps of that same actor from before saying things like Silent repost because my boyfriend would be upset or I fear I would fall for this man but don't tell my boyfriend I said that. I felt so disrespected because she's actively trying to hide it, and this is something she KNEW I would be upset by. Anyways, I then went through her favourited videos and as I thought, a bunch of thirst traps and edits of the same guy over and over again. I know people are going to say You violated her privacy, you clearly didn't trust her in the first place but we've given eachother our passcodes so I don't think it's that problematic, she could've gone through my phone too. Let me know if that's a wrong way of thinking. I confronted her and she smiled and laughed and said you've made yourself sad now why would you do that. She saw I wasn't happy and changed her demeanor, and said she didn't know what to say. We talked and I said how I felt betrayed, she crossed a boundary and how I thought it was disgusting that she was fully aware she was doing something I wasn't comfortable with and tried to hide it. We didn't get into an argument, we were laying in bed saying things individually, taking long pauses to think of what to say, no shouting just calm discussion. When she got home, her parents asked why she was upset and she told them the situation but her parents are very angry at me for going through her phone in the first place, and said that I didn't trust her. She also texted me saying she also thought the same thing but didn't want to tell me when we were hanging out because she didn't want to make the situation worse. I haven't told her I wasn't even planning on going through her phone in the first place but rather just wanted to troll that friend of ours. I know that I should've just left it at that and ignored the videos she sent, rather than going through her favourites. I just want opinions on the situation, am I the asshole for having gone through her phone, or am I right in saying she's in the wrong for having crossed a boundary?",

        "selftext": "So basically 2023 was a really tough time for me emotionally speaking. My grandpa's brother, who we often visited and had great conversations, died in January. That was a really big factor of my mental state, but there were other factors as well. To summarize, my grades were really bad and I was extremely sad and hopeless for the longest continuous period of time in my life, ever.  So, I decided, for some reason, that I'll talk about my problems in the class group chat. The response was immediately dismissive. The crux was that I didn't know what exactly is the problem, I just knew something is very much off. So my classmates were like Why are you talking about your problems if you don't even know what they are? We can't help you if we don't know what you need help with.    In my messages I would describe myself as having a breakdown/tantrum. And I just want to say, I am aware that just because I was in a tough mental state it doesn't mean I'm allowed to drag my classmates into it and do whatever I want. But overall, this has been on my mind a lot since it has happened, and I just want to know what others think. From both sides of the fence.  Thank you!",

        "selftext": "So, this just happened, bear with me while I collect my thoughts.  Today my mother recieved a message from her step nephew. Her brother, my uncle, married a woman who already had 2 kids. He cared for them as if they were his own and we've always been close, even though they live in another country.  The message read something along the lines of Tell your family never to speak to my mother again. You should be ashamed of yourselves. Tell your parents their son would be ashamed of them. We were so confused. For context, we are currently on vacation that my grandparents paid for. Just immediate family, my grandparents, my parents, my brother, my husband, me and my son.  My uncle passed away a few years ago and since then, my mother communicates regularly with my aunt. We face timed her for Christmas. Up until that message, we had no indication anything was wrong. Now my aunt won't answer her calls and her step nephew is refusing to elaborate. Here comes the part where I might become an asshole. My mom has asked us not to tell my grandparents. My dad, brother and husband all know. I know because I was there when my mom got the message. I told my husband and my mom told my dad and my brother.  I think my grandparents deserve to know. I think they could shed light on what happened. My nana talks to my aunt all the time, so maybe something happened? They are napping right now, so it will be a little while before I have the opportunity.  We have speculated on causes but we really have no clue.  So, WIBTA if I went against my mom's wishes and told my grandparents about the message? Update: I spoke to my mom again. All of that side of the family has blocked her on all social media. They have not blocked anyone else, at least as far as I know. My aunt has not blocked or unfriended me, nor has her daughter or granddaughter. I hadn't noticed (I'm not on Facebook much) but the one who sent the message, his wife unfriended me at some point. No idea when. We still don't have an explanation, but I thought you guys might like an update. I haven't told my grandparents, as the consensus seems to be that it's up to my mom. And I get that. For now, as long as she promises to tell them eventually, I'll hold my tongue. Update 2: My mom told my grandparents. They are as confused as we are. They haven't spoken to anyone on that side since about a week before our trip. And it turns out my grandparents were about to send a big cheque. My grandfather has said he won't send the cheque until we get this sorted. My nana is annoyed that they used her son against her for what she perceives as no reason. I think I need to add the context that we live in Canada and they live in the US. And the message came on the day Trump instituted those tariffs. We've always had a difference of politics (they love Trump for some reason) but we almost never talk politics with them. My grandfather thinks they will come around once they realize the money has dried up. Also, they were supposed to send my nana part of my uncle's ashes and they never have. She deserves to have her sons ashes. All of this came out as my nana muttered angrily.",

        "selftext": "My fianc\u00e9e (31F) and I (33M) have a daughter together (2F). My mom passed away in 2020, my dad lives on the other side of the country, and my fianc\u00e9e's parents both passed away in 2014. That leaves the only grandparent figures to my daughter that live nearby as my own grandparents (69F and 72M), who live about 15 minutes away. My grandma (step, but has been a grandma to me my whole life) has an incurable cancer, and my grandpa has dementia that is early on but progressing. Partly for these reasons, we would like our daughter to get as many memories with them as possible while they're still around and before my grandpa's memory loss becomes severe. There was one time we attempted an overnight stay with them while we were home by ourselves. It didn't go so well; she had a hard time going to sleep and was clear she has some separation anxiety. It wasn't all bad, but clearly something that needs to be worked on.  Ever since, my grandma, who between the two of them is usually the one we talk to and who makes decisions, has been quick to point out examples of her showing separation anxiety when around (which has become infrequent, the last time being on Christmas). When asking if they'd be willing to take her for a couple hours to get some time with her, whether just because or we have something to take care of, she refuses, saying she needs to get over separation anxiety before they can take her again. Our thoughts are that she won't get over it if we don't give her a chance to. And we don't exactly have a village of people able to help with that, as partly mentioned before. Meanwhile, my grandparents frequently watch the kids of my cousin (25F), the kids being 6F, 4M, 3M, and 2F. She is no longer with either of the two fathers and has been known to frequently dump her kids on our grandparents. My grandma has said multiple times after various incidents of disrespect that she will not help my cousin anymore, but ultimately winds up doing so anyway. When we bring up these issues, my grandma claims that because these kids are not well taken care of (sadly true), she needs to keep a closer eye on them; we take this as our daughter being punished for being well taken care of. She also believes they do not have separation anxiety because of the rocky relationship with their mom, so they are more willing to be at their house. She takes our pushing that we accuse her of playing favoritism with the other kids.  We realize that someone has to watch those kids so their mom can work. My situation is more fortunate in that regard as I work while my fianc\u00e9e is a stay at home mom. But we think there needs to somehow be more balance in the situation. And again, to have my daughter and grandparents to get plenty of time together before it's too late. So... AITA?",

        "selftext": " My brother (24M) and I (22F) are living at our parents\u2019 house with two siblings until our finances are sorted. Some of us are learning new skills and breaking into careers while we don\u2019t have to worry about bills. I\u2019ve had issues with my older brother (Jamal, placeholder name) before, but lately, he\u2019s been combative. He talks to our two older sisters behind our backs and seems convinced by them our parents are controlling and don\u2019t want us independent. He\u2019s a pain; he doesn\u2019t say anything bad directly, but he goes out of his way to eat healthily and restrict himself in front of me, making me feel bad about my body and weight. He pretends to be supportive, though. He opens canned beans without our mom\u2019s permission, knowing he\u2019s supposed to ask to avoid a mess. His excuse is he bought it with his own money, claiming he doesn\u2019t make messes (he doesn\u2019t, to be fair). Mom gets mad at me whenever he does this, so I have to tell her, which he doesn\u2019t like since it\u2019s \u201cnot my business\u201d and \u201cthis is a problem between me and mom, not you.\u201d He does the same with eggs, setting aside food for himself to \u201csave time\u201d while working on other stuff, which is unfair. Again, he uses the excuse he bought it with his money, but if I have no money, I doubt he does either. He eats more food than us, but I get the impression he thinks he\u2019s better than us because it\u2019s \u201chealthy\u201d or he \u201cworks out,\u201d spending half his day walking around the house or outside. None of this is good for his mental health, and he never listens to us. After I took a shower, I needed to tell our mother something, so I called her and then yelled her name. Jamal came out of his room, ready to leave, and said, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to bother her over the air purifier. I\u2019m coming downstairs; I can turn it off.\u201d I wasn\u2019t asking about that, so I kept calling her and asked him to open her door. He retorted, \u201cWhat are you trying to pry her off her bed for? You don\u2019t need to bother her over every little thing.\u201d I told him I wanted to tell her something. He opened the door, then walked off. I asked if she was on her bed, and he said no. When I told him to walk inside, he said he had to \u201cbe somewhere\u201d (nowhere). I was upset since he knows I\u2019m trying to get her attention, but he does the bare minimum. I laid this out for him and called him weird for that. He cut me off, saying, \u201cDon\u2019t start this with me.\u201d I reiterated everything and insisted he was weird for not helping. He shot back, \u201cYou barely help me. You can\u2019t be bothered to throw a potato in the oven while I\u2019m outside helping our pregnant sister. How about that?\u201d I reiterated every issue of his while he walked off, telling me this was \u201cpetty and unnecessary\u201d before leaving. AITA  Edit: To clarify, I\u2019m describing how his actions make me feel. He has never outright called me fat; I just don\u2019t like watching him eat the way he does since it makes me feel bad.",

        "selftext": "Hello everyone! Just made an account, so bear with me while I try and type this out well! *Fake Names* My best friend Macy (19) and Me ( 22 ) have been best friends for 11 years. We\u2019ve been a very close pair and never had arguments. I watched her grow up while I grew up as well. She\u2019s always been like a sister to me. I\u2019ve been there whenever she needed me as she was also there for me. A few years back she had moved to Maine with her family and it absolutely devastated us. We would hang out on week days and every weekend together and now having that divide was crushing. We still kept in touch and stayed close, communication just got harder as years went on. She has recently graduated, started college and a job. I am so proud of her for all her achievements, she is one of the smartest people I know. A few months ago she got engaged to her 6 year long relationship with her boyfriend Rob ( 20 ). I was ABSOLUTELY ecstatic!!! To see her beaming for joy was a beautiful heartwarming thing. He proposed to her around all their friends when they went on a camping trip. How cute, right? She face-timed me to tell me and show me the ring. I jumped up and down and squealed for her hahaha. A few months after she was talking to me about plans for their wedding. They decided to hold off until they both graduated college to officially get married. I think that's a very wise decision on their part. After telling me this, she proceeded to say- \u201cOh btw. Destiny ( 18 ) is probably going to be my Maid Of Honor. Hope you aren\u2019t upset.\u201d I won\u2019t lie, it was like a slap to the face and it did hurt. Her and Destiny became friends when she moved to Maine. They\u2019ve been friends for around 7 years now. It hurt me only because I feel even though she\u2019s been great friends with her, it would make more sense for me to be that since we\u2019ve had a close friendship of 11 years going on 12 now. I didn\u2019t want her to feel I was trying to be an ass or poison the conversation on something exciting, so I kept quiet for now. I waited a month and I couldn\u2019t shake the hurt I was feeling. Since she moved I felt a bit like I was now the \u201cPast\u201d so to speak. I texted Macy- explaining how I truly felt and how I wasn\u2019t trying to create issues, but just voicing my feelings. She told me she was never trying to hurt me but that Destiny just meant a lot to her\u2026.but don\u2019t I as well? She told me I could still be a bridesmaid but it was just the bluntness and putting a friend she hasn\u2019t known for as long in that position that truly just hurt me and made me feel off.  Am I the asshole for being upset about this? ",

        "selftext": "Hey all,I was in a bar last week and I was having a good time with a friend. A lot of people interacted with us and we were all having a good time.  There was a moment where a few girls asked if they could sit with us. For context we were are both males. I did not really talk to their group, other than saying hi, and I was speaking to another girl about university and the states. One of the girls from the group, was flirting with my friend I believe and earlier when they first sat down, my friend asked her what she thought of Australia day, and she said Invasion Day... my parents invaded. I understood the banter, but didn't mess with that, so already knew to not engage with them and avoid them. At a certain point I was just sitting with the one girl from the group and myself, as my friend and her's went to get drinks seperately. We started talking about skincare as she saw my lip balm on the table and made a lewd comment about me having it. I told her so you like my friend and she said yeah but was saying what he was wearing wasn't nice. I asked her if she had a boyfriend and she said she was dating a guy, and I asked if her friends had boyfriends and she said yes, and I said oh it's probably best you don't sit with us, but I hope he pleases you (meant it as treats you well, BUT that is a bit weird to say) you and everything goes well. She took offence and said these aren't your seats and said a few rude things I can't remmeber, I said yes but we were here first this is our land, so you can piss off basically taking a dig at what she said before. About 20 minutes later, a member of staff came to me and pulled me aside. They explained I was reported as making an inappropriate comment to a few females and I had to leave. I was taken aback but said yeah of course, because I know better than to argue as it's a strict policy that bars need to enforce. When I was being escorted out I did explain there was a girl I told to girl to kick rocks when I found out she had a boyfriend, although I had been interacting with men/women all night and nobody had complained. I was pretty much sober as I don't like to drink much. The staff that escorted me out apologised and said they felt uncomfortable doing that to me, and I said that they were being professional and it's fine. They said they would love to have me back but as a hard  policy, any complaint is taken seriously. We exchanged names and that was it. I am 99% sure this was why I was kicked out. Whether something was taken out of context is understandable, and to be honest I should have known better to be rude. AITA for telling someone to piss off and getting kicked out, of was this blown out of proportion?",

The thing is, when everyone is gone and I'm alone in the apartment, I tend to lock the bedroom door bc it makes me feel safer.  Today my roommate was suppose to come back. Well, during the time they were coming back to the apartment, I took a nap after studying for 6 hours straight so i was lowkey drained and completely forgot about the lock door. I'm a pretty heavy sleeper and therefore i did not notice them knocking on the door. They called me once and texted me once but i slept through that. Around 2 hours later, i finally awoken and saw their text. I immediately got up to unlock it and by that time they were hella fricking pissed. I see that I do sound like ah but its not like they were locked out of the apt. idk maybe im overthinking it and i am an ahole. ",

        "selftext": "Pre-COVID, I (31F) was a bridesmaid for my cousin, Diva (34F). Everything was going smoothly until a few weeks before the wedding. Being artistically inclined, I offered to design her wedding invitations as a gift but made it clear I couldn't produce them myself due to financial constraints, as I was handling my mother's medical bills and our family dog's medication for his heart condition. To provide context, I'm an only child caring for a senior citizen (my mother, who is over 70 years old and a cancer patient) and our senior dog. As the wedding planning progressed, Diva approved my designs with some revisions, and I happily submitted them. However, when the actual invitations arrived, they weren't my designs. This was heartbreaking because if I had been informed that my design wouldn't be used, I would have been fine with it, but no one told me. I let it go and moved on. Regarding the pre-wedding parties, I couldn't attend due to my mother's and our dog's medical conditions, which Diva knew about for months and years prior. Despite this, Diva was upset. I couldn't leave my mother, as there was no one else to care for her, nor could she handle our dog, who needed medication and could be aggressive. Hiring help was also not an option due to financial constraints. The Maid of Honor (MOH) got involved, and I kept asking for consideration due to my family responsibilities. The whole family knew about my mother's condition, and some knew about our dog's condition, but I was told I wasn't fulfilling my bridesmaid duties. I had already designed the invitations and helped with bridesmaid dress choices, but I couldn't attend the pre-wedding parties. This led to a feud among the cousins and eventually reached our parents. Days before the wedding, I was still trying to be a good bridesmaid. Hair and makeup were scheduled for 3 AM, but with my responsibilities, I couldn't leave home at 2 AM. I offered to do my own hair and makeup and even negotiated to arrive before the wedding started, prioritizing the ceremony. However, they wouldn't compromise, so my mother and I decided not to attend to avoid further drama. In hindsight, it was a blessing in disguise because our dog passed away on the wedding day, and we were there for him when he passed.",

        "selftext": "I was recently out late night to party with my friends. We found this fancy pub which attracts a lot of tourists - I\u2019m not one as I\u2019ve been in this country for more than a year now. I\u2019m an expat, Asian (brown). We decided to enter the pub. The bouncer was standing right in front of the entrance. I saw him and made a small head nod with a smile proceeding to walk past (which I do usually with no issues at all, kinda always felt like a bar/pub code) while he was parallely saying something to me in the local language which I don\u2019t speak. Note - he didn\u2019t block the way by any means or hand gestures or there was no queue. In a second, I was aggressively pulled from behind, he snatched my backup and shouted with anger along the lines of \u201cYOU DON\u2019T WALK BY WHEN I\u2019M TALKING, YOU DISRESPECTED ME, THIS IS MY PLACE AND YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED\u201d. I was shook by this manhandling incident and apologised to him that I didn\u2019t understand the language and not meant to disrespect him by any means. He furiously said, it doesn\u2019t matter and I\u2019m denied access. I apologised and returned. Firstly, it\u2019s not a local pub, the name is evidently common across many countries and it attracts tourists - why communicate in a local language? Second, even if that was a miss from my side to not attempt to understand what he was saying or informing him I don\u2019t speak the language, was his behaviour justified or AITA? Note - I was not super drunk or unstable or alarming by any chance, also had a decent outfit for a pub and was let in with a smile by the other bouncer in a different pub. Edit - I went through the reviews of this pub in internet and the bouncers are known for their notorious racial discriminations so it\u2019s not a me issue. But nevertheless I will not play the racist card here, because I did misunderstand his communication as an invitation/greeting due to my lack of attention/language barrier. I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019d have got a different treatment if was not brown after reading the reviews.",

We didn't have family to bail us out, so I was desperate. had already talked with my bf about if I should but I made it seem like a joke. He told me flat out he didn't want me doing that and was super stern about it. So when I did start selling I didn't tel my boyfriend because I knew he wouldn't be okay with it.

He believed it and was really happy but last night he went through my phone and found out. We've been arguing about it all day and I feel terrible. He got really mad and said I betrayed his trust. He said I should've talked to him instead of doing it behind his back but if I talked to him he wouldve never let me. I get why he's upset, but I feel like I didn't have a choice. I don't make a crazy amount of money but it's just enough so we van afford our expenses.

One of my housemates really likes ambient lighting and I've had to ask her to take a motion sensor light down in the hall and on another occassion she took another light down after I suggested a compromise. So now in our living room she's put 3 lamps which are just exposed, high strengh lightbulbs (with no shades). To be fair I almost never use the living room, in part because of anxiety but also in part because our other housemate (who is now moving out) has anger management issues so it wasn't a great vibe. But I was hoping to actually socialise with the new housemate who I have mutual friends with. I also had to take my migraine meds when she left the door to the living room open with one of the lights on but tbf she's now moved it out of view from thedoor. WIBTA if I asked her to get rid of the lamps from the living room/move them to her room? I think I might be TA because I've already asked her to remove lights from common areas, she's spent money on them and has them in a room that I barely ever use. Edit: So for info I'm not against any light, in the previous situation I just asked to have the overhead light on instead as I can just wear a cap.

Sharon and her husband(Vlad) rented out almost the whole resort and paid for a villa for me and my parents to stay in. This villa had a pool (all to ourselves!!) and two separate mini buildings, one for living and one for lounging. This wedding was VERY extravagant with a lot of Vlad's business partners. Their business social life is the type where you are drunk all day making fun of people; each business associate was pretty fat with a wife who had crazy Botox and plastic surgery. After the beach ceremony, we were escorted to a dining/dance space where lots of speeches were given. One of the speeches was given by a business associate's wife(who fits the beauty standard explained above). Her speech was pretty unremarkable, and I wasn't paying much attention until she mentioned Sharon's Son's help with her business called Blackwater. I'm not sure if she made the connection to the infamous mercenary firm, but it made me *almost* laugh, I held it in UNTIL she proceeded to explain what her company was about: water with minerals in it, making it black. Basically, it was dirt water that cracked me up like crazy, and I couldn't hold it in. The room was completely silent before this, and everyone's heads whipped towards me. The speech went on, but it was very awkward. After we finished dinner I was pulled over by Sharon who scolded me for laughing and said that everyone was asking her who I was and why I laughed. Apparently the girl felt very embarrassed and self-conscious after I cracked up. People have been treating me like a pariah ever since. 1.

At first, things were fine, but now I feel suffocated. She constantly interrupts my study time, pushing me to play video games or chat despite my boundaries. I\u2019m an extrovert, but after long days at school, I crave alone time. When I retreat to my room, she knocks, saying she feels lonely and wants to sit on my floor, staring at me or talking about her day. I don\u2019t have the backbone to say no, and she pushes back when I try.  Enter my other best friend, Erica (18F), who I\u2019ve known since we were 10. She\u2019s introverted, incredibly kind, and planning for med school, meaning she\u2019s highly study-oriented. She currently lives in expensive student housing but plans to move home next year, which would mean a brutal 1-2 hour commute. If I had chosen her as my roommate originally, she would have benefited from the affordable rent.  Recently, Ava\u2019s parents offered her a free apartment near campus. I was thrilled for her and saw it as the perfect opportunity\u2014she could save money, and Erica could move in, improving her living situation. I told Erica it was a possibility, and she was excited. However, Ava just told me she\u2019s staying because she\u2019s comfortable here and doesn\u2019t want a new roommate. When she told me, I couldn\u2019t hide my disappointment. Now Ava keeps saying it\u2019s my fault for getting Erica\u2019s hopes up and insists I just want to replace her. But I truly think this move would be better for everyone\u2014Ava could grow more independent, save money, and Erica wouldn\u2019t have to commute for hours. I feel like Ava is holding onto me too tightly, and I don\u2019t know how to navigate this. So, Reddit, AITA for wanting my roommate to move out?",

So for some backstory my girlfriend has a friend (Sarah) who had a roommate (Cate) living with her and she had a cat there that she left. Eventually Cate moved and abandoned the cat basically leaving Sarah to take care of the cat for months by herself. I heard many bad things about Cate and her cat but that's just what I heard anyway; I'm at a party with my girlfriend and she's with the lady's in a room when she come into a different room with me and the guys saying that Cate said the cat was pregnant then threw that cat and said she didnt want her anymore! I wasn't there but I believe her when it comes to stuff like that she had a cat for 14 years and she's very passionate about animals. The next day Sarah calls my girlfriend and says the cats throwing up and unfortunately had worms and wasn't pregnant. So Me and her take the cat to a shelter because we can't afford to do the surgery and all that but wanted what's best. Now I'm adopting the cat but Cate is now looking for it claiming she wanted the cat. Am I in the wrong for kidnapping this cat? Sorry for the long post and it may not be the best it's my first.

The problem starts in the pandemic when we both started to have serious issues with self-destructive behaviour.Since last year I have been improving greatly and I think I\u2019m finally healing, but my friend doesn\u2019t seem to want to get on the same path as me. I respect her choices but I really want to help her and it breaks my heart to see her like this, knowing that having her around always slows down my healing journey.Last month, she went on vacation and told me she ordered a package online and sent it to my house (without asking me) and I said it was fine. When it arrived, I stored it in a box under my bed. Some weeks pass, she comes back from her trip and messages me to hang out. She specifically asked me to bring the package, and I thought it was weird but didn\u2019t think too much of it. As I was packing some stuff to bring to her house, I opened the box under my bed and noticed the package wasn\u2019t there. My parents called me downstairs to talk and my dad told me he knew what was inside the package. It was something that could really harm her, and I had no idea. I explained the situation to my parents and thankfully they believed I had no idea about what was inside and I thought I was doing my friend a favour. I started to really think about it and I got really sad at the thought of having helped her smuggle the package behind her parents\u2019 backs. I asked my dad for the package and threw it in the trash before going to my friend\u2019s house. When I arrived, she asked me for the package and I told her what happened. She seemed angry at me and was really quiet through our hangout. I asked my mom to pick me up early, and when I got to my house today, she bombarded my phone with messages saying her package had costed her a lot money and demanded I pay her what she spent or buy her the exact same thing she had bought. I\u2019m not really in a good financial position because I\u2019m saving up for my own education\u2014her family is much richer than mine and her allowance is about three times more than mine\u2014and I didn\u2019t want to spend money only to buy her something dangerous behind her and my parents\u2019 backs. I refused to pay, but that only upset her more. Am I the asshole? ",

We both recently found our niche and audience and have been growing in views in views and followers. What kicked this off was Jacob using a trending audio that sky rocketed his views. I made similar videos (never with the same audio) about the same topic because he and I were really well versed in it. Since his initial video blew up he made numerous other videos with that same audio. All of which preformed well. We both supported each other tremendously and always helped each other with videos whenever we could. Our videos went from 200-500 views to 10s of 100s of thousands. This was big for us as we had been trying to reach an audience for a couple years. But It all changed overnight. One day whole brain storming video ideas, I became inspired but my friends video and decided to make a video using the audio and format from his initial post that blew up. I was excited to tell him about it and show it to him before posting. That night while we were gaming I told him about my idea. His mood instantly changed and I could tell he was bothered. He flat out told me that I was stealing his thing. He asked me if I told you not to post that you wouldn't post it right? To which I replied no. As much as I love Jacob I was never gonna let him dictate what I do and don't post on social media. As in the past he has tried to be rather controlling of myself and other friends. He tried telling me that audio is my thing in this community and you're basically stealing my ir I told him that's how trends and social media works. One person makes something and everyone else copies. He kept calling it my audio when he wasn't even the one who created it. He followed a similar format to everyone else who used it, just specific to our niche. There was a lot of back and forth of him telling me not to but me standing my ground. I went as far as saying \u201cnothing bad can happen to you if I post this\u201d to which he said \u201cyou don\u2019t know that\u201d He wouldn't budge and said straight up I don't want you posting that. It's my thing. I told him I'm sorry but no, you're not gonna dictate this. At the end of the day I didn't end up posting the video, mainly because I was never going to prioritize social media over our friendship. He got off the game when the conversation ended. We still send each other posts every now and again but we haven't had a conversation since then. So am I the asshole for not taking down my post because my friend told me to.",

        "selftext": "My nephew (18M) is a a senior in high school. An important context to know is that he is bisexual, as this plays a role in the story. He is best friends with a freshman which I will call Jake (15M). Jake and my nephew have been best friends since the beginning of the school year. They hang out frequently and tend to call everyday to play games. My nephew is bisexual and he rarely discloses this information except people he trusts, like Jake. I was informed by my nephew that Jake's friend, Danny, has spread fear and disturbing rumors about their friendship. My nephew told me that Danny and Jake are in a turbulent spot with their friendship, therefore things have been heated between the two. So Danny has taken note that my nephew and Jake are close buddies, and has projected his anger on my nephew to spread libel about him.  Danny, Danny's mom, and Jake's mom are all linked together like espionage. While Danny and Jake were fighting, he secretly hijacked information between Danny and my nephew's friendship. Please note that Jake and my nephew are not romantically involved. So Danny's mom saw my nephew and Jake riding on an electric scooter together, which she has blown out of proportion in the context that my nephew and Jake are in a relationship. Then, my nephew told me that Danny came to the conclusion he is gay because of a joke Jake made while they all had lunch together. Danny has communicated with his mother in malice of my nephew, and spreads fear about my nephew's sexuality to Jake's mom. Jake's mom and Danny's mom are best friends, and have been in communication about this. Now, Jake's mom is accusing my nephew of grooming and influencing Jake to identifyas LGBT. My nephew has NOT DONE THAT. Now, my nephew and Jake have a strained relationship because his parents banned Jake from speaking to my nephew due to these horrific rumors. Even though my nephew is an adult, I feel like I need to take this to the school. I want to confront the parents for overdramatizing and hijacking information about my nephew's sexuality. With the fact he is 18, I fear they could exacerbate it considering the political climate in the US. WIBTA?",

We had a teenage romance in early high school that eventually became an on-again-off-again thing in our twenties before finally completely dissolving at around my thirtieth birthday.  We did briefly get married shortly after college graduation so that she could get on my health insurance, but we were living separately at the time and even dating other people.  Because we've known each other for so long, we'll still get coffee or talk over Zoom 4-5x a year to catch up, but the romantic part of our relationship has been completely buried for close to over a decade. And when I say buried, I mean completely gone. Not even a little spark. We've lived across the country from eachother for about five years now. The meetups are mostly talking about life and work shit and the occasional reminiscing. I'm reluctant to give them up because, gloomily enough, Mandy and I are the only two people from our original friend group that are either still living or talking to eachother. I've been with my current wife (38F, Sam) for around six years. She knows about my conversations with Mandy, and she's given her approval, but I can tell the approval has been given reluctantly.  I love my wife to death and I don't want to make her feel uncomfortable, but I also don't want to lose this connection to my past. WIBTA for continuing this platonic relationship with my ex?",

If you don\u2019t, here\u2019s a quick rundown, basically Doug Ford is sending $200 to every citizen of Ontario, by mail, as a way to convince them to vote for him.  Today, my older sibling (23 NB) got their bribery cheque in the mail, my parents still haven\u2019t gotten theirs and so it became a topic of discussion between my dad and I.  My dad mentioned that in his and my mom\u2019s bribery cheques is also money for me (nearly 16 F) and so naturally I asked to have access to this money, and my dad said no. I then messaged my mom as she\u2019s usually the more reasonable of the two, and she said that because I don\u2019t pay taxes it\u2019s not actually my money.  My birthday is in less than a month and because it\u2019s my sweet 16 I\u2019m planning to go all out, my mum knows this and I said that this money would make everything so much easier for me as I\u2019m paying for my entire party out of pocket, she said \u201cexactly because we pay for everything it\u2019s our money.\u201d  Imo, the least they could do is keep the money for when I\u2019m 18 and actually do pay taxes. Maybe I\u2019m just understanding wrong but my dad literally worded it as \u201cmoney for you\u201d that they just won\u2019t give to me.

        "selftext": "Okay so. At school I have this one particular friend. This friend I\u2019ve known since last year but we started to be closer friends this year being my senior year, but for some reason I don\u2019t know how I never noticed but this friend smells absolutely terrible. I try to warn him about this because I don\u2019t want him to get made fun of by other people but he doesn\u2019t believe me because the only people he hangs out with are \u201cweird\u201d kids who I am kind of forced to be friends with because I\u2019m friends with him. And those kids do NOT fucking shower and don\u2019t care about hygiene enough to tell him. I try to assure him I\u2019m not lying and tell him in private so I don\u2019t embarrass him but it just never changes, he lies and says he cleans his clothes everyday but he wears the exact same thing every day. He isn\u2019t financially unstable or poor either, he is able to afford a lot of things I\u2019ve seen in the past. He just genuinely doesn\u2019t believe he smells bad. I feel as though being around him kind of harms my reputation because people will assume it\u2019s me who smells but it\u2019s really him, and I feel like such a dick sometimes for trying to be blunt and honest with him but it is to complete deaf ears. What\u2019s worse is that every morning I sit in this specific spot where I enjoy my personal time before class, but this year he found my spot and there followed all the other kids who also act odd. I started distancing myself from him and sitting in different places trying to avoid him because I genuinely cannot bear the way he smells and the people he brings along. And I\u2019m not just hating on the people he brings because they\u2019re \u201cweird\u201d, they are actually horrible people who constantly talk crazy amounts of shit about me and contribute to rumors spread on me, and whenever I tell them it bothers me they look at me as if I\u2019m fucking weirdo. Also I was planing on asking out a girl who sits near the place where me and him sit, and for some fucking reason whenever I tell him about this he snaps back and looks dead at her and says \u201cWHO HER?\u201d, this was my final straw that made me decide I am done spending time with this guy. I currently sit in a different spot in the morning and I try to tell him it\u2019s for a different reason but he genuinely will not stop talking to me at every opportunity and I just told him one day \u201cBro you smell like fucking shit please stop talking\u201d and he looked at me crazy. I dunno, am I the asshole for this? ",

        "selftext": "Okay so some background, I am a female high school student and I am dating a boy in high school as well. However, we go to different schools. This Saturday he has his snowball dance and 3 weeks ago we talked about it and mutually decided we\u2019d go to my schools because he didn\u2019t wanna go to his and he thought mine would be more fun so I agreed. I wanted to go to both but didn\u2019t push because I didn\u2019t want to make him do smth he didn\u2019t want to. I figured it wouldn\u2019t be an issue. A few days ago he asked what day my dance was on and I told him \u201cit\u2019s in two weeks\u201d and he said \u201coh okay cool because my friends just invited me to go to my schools dance and stay the night at his house.\u201d And I got a little hurt and said \u201cwhy are you going? I thought you didn\u2019t want to because it was lame\u2026?\u201d And he said \u201cwell I just got invited and I think I\u2019d be fun with my friends.\u201d and we js left it at that. Today, the topic was brought up again and I told him I was uncomfortable with the idea because there are quite a few girls at his school that I\u2019m very suspicious of, there is a girl he\u2019s friends with who is going, and it was weird to go to a school dance with your friends when you have a gf. He told me I was being paranoid and he wasn\u2019t gonna cheat and he js wanted to have fun with friends. I told him I was fine with him hanging out with his friends but maybe in a setting I was more comfortable with. He said I was being dramatic and it was js an innocent hang out, I told him it was weird to go with your friends and he said \u201ceveryone went with each other last time\u201d and I told him \u201cyeah that\u2019s bc they don\u2019t have gfs\u201d and he got all annoyed. I\u2019ve talked with 4 of my good girl friends, 1 male friend, my brother, my parents, and a family friend and all of them think it\u2019s a little odd. I tried explaining my whole side of things and how I would prefer if he skipped so I\u2019d be more comfortable and he just told me girls don\u2019t like him, he\u2019s not interested, and I\u2019m being annoying and pissing him off because he just wants to hang out with his friends. I know this is very stupid and trivial, but these are my issues and I\u2019m only in high school once. Let me have little problems now. Am I the asshole for arguing with my bf over this? Edit: On Wednesday he said he would go to my basketball game and then backed out last minute (like an hour before) and told me he\u2019d hang out with me Friday and Sunday to make up for it. I got a text yesterday (Thursday) where he told me he was also spending the night with his friends on Friday night. I got upset and told him that was going to mess up our plans and he got mad at me and said he never does anything with them and he wants to see them. He has a sleep over with them every 2 weeks and when I want to do things with friends I never can because I\u2019m cancelling stuff to be with him. I\u2019ve had people over in October and that was the last time that happened. He ended up breaking up with me because I\u2019m too controlling, according to him. Everyone I\u2019ve talked to thinks that yes I should\u2019ve handled it better and shouldn\u2019t have gotten as upset as I did, but I also explained to him that I wasn\u2019t telling him he couldn\u2019t see his friends but that I was upset that he planned over our previously made plans. He disregarded what I said and how I was feeling. Everyone he talked to about it told him it was extremely impulsive and that he should\u2019ve thought about it more. I skipped school today because I am absolutely devastated. His friends are all trying to talk sense into him and say he\u2019s crazy\u2026 I don\u2019t know what to do now\u2026",

        "selftext": "For a little context I met my BF in high school. We dated off and on early in our friendship but over the past 12 years aside from a short Covid fling we\u2019ve been solid long distance buddies. There was a discussion about moving in with BF in their town to restart my life. BF always thought I should get out of my old city. I said no that I couldn\u2019t live in a small town. Last year BF brought it up and told me that was an ask to try to get back together. This has been in the back of mind, but I never acted on it. Well over the past month BF returned into my life full time for a bit. First was visiting parents and secondly we planned a cruise in my friend group. I started catching feelings during the time we hung out. It fully set in over the cruise. Not sure exactly what I was feeling at that time, but I figured I had time to sort myself out. Turns out one of the people(NG) we met on the cruise made a huge impact.  What was supposed a short stay at the beach post cruise with three friends left over turned into a scene out of a romance movie that would have the whole dinner table turning heads to listen. My other friend and I became background characters to GF and BFs vacation. It had classics like a spontaneous a road trip and sleeping on the beach. I did not handle it well. The first few days BF noticed and pointed it out. I confessed after some prodding and BF was very nice about it. GF listened to me babble and made sure I was ok. That bit of honesty, however, unleashed a torrent of emotion I didn\u2019t know I had. I became a vacuum of negativity. It got worse as I literally had front seats to their growing flirting, whispers and lack of presence to others in the group.  The lowest was when BFs new partner tried to warm up to me and give me \u201cwe can talk about anything that\u2019s bothering you\u201d line. Having the person who swept your crush off their feet try to console you is a torture fit for one of the nine hells. The last night before we all flew back my BF decided to ditch the group for hankey pankey while we were on the understanding that we would hang out before going our separate ways. Radio silence till 7am next day. When they got back I lost it and said things about BF being selfish and making the whole trip about themselves, rubbing their relationship in everyone else\u2019s face until they couldn\u2019t be bothered to have is around. Couldn\u2019t show some restraint for a few days? There was a \u201csorry you felt that way\u201d apology. I shut down and left for the airport by myself in the morning as BF and NG shared a shower in our hotel. I got a tearful phone messages saying that BG doesn\u2019t want to lose me and that I can take my time to pieces things, but no apology. I\u2019ve blocked her, for my own sanity but I felt disrespected. I probably should have said something earlier. Maybe never say anything at all and pack it down. Crush or not I find it hard to see me as the asshole here for expecting some restraint. I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m the asshole, but how big am I?",

        "selftext": "Before diving into the problem that happened last week, I need to do some background from previous years. I'm 25 (M) have been playing RPGs with my friends for a long time (about 10 years together), we've tried many systems, books and even made our own RPG (it didn't work out as intended). Around 2020, the pandemic hit my country and my schedule changed, because of that, I had to quit some RPG sessions and deny new ones until I figured out my new schedule. At the time denied an RPG that I really wanted, however, I couldn't commit to participating; the planning started in mid-2020, but it didn't work out so the idea was scraped out. After that, in 2022, the pandemic was much more manageable, and everything was getting back to normal, the RPG plan that I wanted to play with my friends was coming back, but they didn't invite me. The Dungeon Master (DM for short) already had a full team (6 people), and was unable to add one more.At the time, I was the jerk because I started harassing the DM to put me in the game, and this started a big fight (if necessary, I will can be specific in an edit), but long story short, all RPG games with my friends were stopped for 6 months because I created a rift between friends, some understood the context of 2020 and they were on my side, others defended the DM because I denied my seat at the time. In the end, the DM and I apologized for eachother and the RPG did not happen. Now, for the problem that is happening: Another RPG started brewing with another DM (I will call her Anna) started planning a Oneshot, she is already a DM in another RPG session (D&D) that I also play, however, she wanted to also DM Exalted (a really complex system). Anna invited me and 4 other friends to play, at the time I said yes. So the next day I started reading the system and was really intimidated,it has 200+ charms, and alot of specifc rules, so I asked one of the players for help, but it didn't help much. Intimidated and confused, I later told Anna that I was vacating my seat; she was upset but didn't argue, later another friend took my seat. My reasoning to gave up my seat was that I wouldn't commit to a really complex system to play only 1-3 sessions, only if it was a campaign I would comit. A few days passed, and I heard from my friends that Anna was thinking about changing the Exated one-shot to a campaign, and she would stop her D&D campaign for it. I didn't tell my friends at the time, but I was really upset, not only would the one-shot become a campaign, but the other campaigns would stop because of it. So, IATA for asking for my playce back in the campaing with the fear of bringing back that rift and maybe losing some friends?",

We had 8-2, better than JV and Varsity had this year. We had spent all of our Sumner practicing and grinding every day until the season started. Well, one day in practice (in the middle of July) after warm-ups, I had given a suggestion to our Coach about how the defense needs to work on their hand movement and the way they should go when the ball is snapped. BTW, our defense sucked this summer.....i was on defense\ud83d\ude11. And, he looked at me, like he's my dad when I did something stupid, and I said, What? He said.Well, can't it wait?! Half of the people were on my side, and half were on the coach's. I still continued, and all I said that made him really mad was, Maybe if you weren't so soft on us, then Defense would've sucked right now. And I wanna add one more person, he's another coach, he had served time in the military, and as soon as he heard me what I said , he said All, right. Since yall were soft, LEMME MAN YOU THE F*CK UP! And made all of us run nonstop until practice is over. If we slow down, it is more minutes, walking and talking, more minutes. Luckily, we finished before I had a heart attack, and everyone knew not to give coach obvious facts to anger or punish us like that ever again. AITA? Edit 2/5/25: Okay, yes, ITA, but if yall wanna know if my team hated me or not, no, they didn't hate me, they didn't clown on my ass, we just simply laughed it off and that was that.",

        "selftext": "I'll try to be as fair as I possibly can to my friend about this. She's mad at me because I basically forced her to admit that she needs to be alone. I'm entirely *okay* with her needing to be alone but she refused to actually admit that or communicate with me until I basically said, either tell me what's fucking going on or take the space you so clearly need already. This started basically two weeks ago. My friend shut down without telling me what was going on. I still don't know the entire story of why she did tbh. Then, about a week ago she said she was ready to talk again and explained a little about how why she shut down but not the whole reason. She said she was ready to talk again but she *very* clearly wasn't. I kept telling her that if she needed more space I genuinely did not care and would give her that, she didn't say she did.  Then these past few days she started replying to the first few messages I'd send then ignoring me entirely the rest of the day. Again I said if she needed space to tell me that. She didn't. This morning she said she's trying to distance herself from everyone and that she's used to being alone almost all the time. Finally it came to a head just a few minutes ago and I called her out. I basically laid it out for her, I said either tell me what's going on and let's settle this or take your space already but stop pretending like there's nothing wrong.  Keep in mind. This is a friend I'd been talking to pretty much 24/7 for the past two to three months. We'd gotten really, REALLY close, she told me things very few people in her life know. I think I have a right to say something, to be worried when she basically disappears on me, comes back, but then *everything* is different than it was before and she essentially says she has no plans of things going back to how they were beforehand. AITA here?  Edit: I sent her this message because I realized pretty quickly that yeah I'm the asshole here, I promise I'm not going to send anything after this but I need to apologize. I've been spamming you with messages, not respecting your boundaries, and, simply put not ACTUALLY listening to what you've been telling me this whole time even if you didn't directly say it. I don't know that I can claim to actually care about you after doing all that. I'll leave you alone now for a while. I hope we can reconnect and fix things eventually but if not I understand ",

        "selftext": "Once I asked a friend to help me move and they said yes because they are compassionate and helpful. I told them I'd buy a pizza. I had already hired 2 guys and a truck to do the heavy lifting, just needed some extra hands. Then one of the guys quit while we were still packing up boxes with stuff. So i asked my friend if they could fill in and they said yes because they saw I was in need and they are compassionate and helpful. I offered to buy my friend some additional pizza.  After a few hours of heavy lifting (I assume, I had to pop out for a bit for band rehearsal) my friend asked if I could pay them what I was going to give to the guy who quit.  Unfortunately, I already gave that guy money, so I could only pay my friend about half that. Then the other guy with the truck quit and I told my friend just to cover for them until I found a new guy.  I told my friend I couldn't give them any additional money for helping, but I would pay them $1 for each box. They said ok because it wasn't really about the money, it was about helping.After we got the truck loaded, I paid them $1 for every box... after the first 100 boxes. I forgot to tell them that part. The lock on the truck was broken and I didn't want to pay to fix it, so I told my friend to sleep in the truck to keep it safe while we parked it on the Chicago streets until we could unload it in a couple days. They said ok, because they knew no one else would do it and they wanted to keep the boxes safe. When it was time to unload the truck, I had to let her get a head start without me (I had band practice again). They were responsible for bringing boxes up the stairs while I was responsible for telling them which room to put them in (though admittedly I did get distracted a few times, phones right?). Once we got it all unloaded, my friend was helping me unpack because they saw I needed the extra hands. I opened the box marked kitchen and discovered that one of my mugs wasn't in the kitchen box.  I asked my friend where the mug was. They said they weren't sure, maybe it was just forgotten in all the confusion and they could go back to the house to check or look in another box.  I fired them immediately and began telling their friends and coworkers, I don't know for sure that they didn't steal the mug.  So, am I the a-hole? Which is more likely- that my friend did all that work and still stole a mug? or that I gave them an impossible task without supporting her and one item in a sea of items was temporarily misplaced?",

        "selftext": "AITA for cancelling on my friend AGAIN? So me (18f) and my friend (19m) have been friends for a good year now and we met at uni kind of cause our friend groups collided. We have been good friends but our communication is pretty ass on both of our parts.  Now we made plans to hang out at new years at his place, which for me is a good two hour trip and not that I mind the distance but I couldn\u2019t sleep over there cause his roommate would have friends over and they wouldn\u2019t have any space for me. And we couldnt spend it at mine since i would still be moving in and have nothing but a single person mattress and a lot of bags and boxes to get around. We planned this like a week ahead and I did say I might have to cancel later on while planning cause of my dad being in the hospital with a broken thumb and a harsh infection on the stitches. I also told him about my worry for the distance I\u2019d have to travel that late at night, but said I\u2019d let him know about it. Which I did four days prior that I wouldn\u2019t be able to make it due to the reasons I gave him before. I told him I was sorry and that I\u2019d make up for it soon. But all he did was sigh loudly and said \u201cokay, yeah sure.\u201d And before I could say anything else he hung up. He ghosted me for like a week and didnt even show up to the place where our friends meet up for a week and a half. Then he showed up like nothing happened until he asked to talk to me alone and continued to talk about how it was a asshole move to cancel on him like that and acted like I betrayed him last second.  Now I apologized again in that moment and then he said it\u2019s fine and that we could go back to being friends like we stopped because I cancelled.  So a few weeks ago, he invited me to go to this vintage market after college. To which I kind of said the same thing about having to see cause I was a little busy and starting a new therapy trial and could be tired at that time. That day came and I went home early after puking on an empty stomach and he called me the moment I was gonna text him and I told him first thing and he didn\u2019t even say anything before hanging up and ghosting me again and he hasn\u2019t texted me since. I haven\u2019t been at college since then and I follow my classes online cause I\u2019m still incredibly sick and I haven\u2019t been able to leave my house or move too much at all.  I\u2019ve been feeling guilty about it the entire time and I\u2019ve tried to apologize a lot of times through text but he just keeps ignoring me. I feel really shitty about cancelling him a bunch of times and I really don\u2019t know if it\u2019s my fault or not?  So AITA?",

Mother informs of a program that let's us build home with other people and eventually that house is given to the members who built it, that way we can still be together as my culture often does.

The thing is, my friend saw it (way deep into other old stories) and shared it with me, saying: \u201cI look really fat, like a pig. Delete it.\u201d She always says something along those lines, even though she\u2019s nowhere near fat, and in that picture she looked normal. Had she looked ugly I would\u2019ve deleted it no questions asked, but it was a cute picture with other friends that I don\u2019t even see that much. It was a fun memory. So we fought, her saying she looked bad, me saying no one looks at my stories anyway (I have few followers), and most importantly, deleting it felt like accepting her delusion and harmful comments about her body. She then threatened to share ugly photos of me (that I honestly don\u2019t care about) and report the story. I said go ahead. Anyway, after a long fight, I gave in. I know that her high school friends were obsessed with being skinny and laughed at fat girls (what the fuck), so I know it\u2019s a sensitive issue for her (even though she doesn\u2019t realize it). I deleted the story, but I still think I shouldn\u2019t have. Am I the asshole? ",

        "selftext": "I (M27) work in the hospitality industry. I've been at my actual company there for 2 years and I have made different friendships along the way, including a group of friends.  In this group there are 2 people which I will call Laura (F) & Paul (M). They are both in their early thirties. I have been very close to them. My relationship with Laura is based on a lot of compassion, laughter & we are basically telling each other almost everything, she helped a lot at the beginning when I started and she believes in me.  With Paul the relationship I would say have been a bit toxic but good, as I was always afraid of how he would react, he would give me a lot of advices based solely on his pov. He never really tried to understand me as a whole (I struggle with mental health), a lot of tough love I would say.  Early December we have decided to buy a common gift for a birthday. Laura has bought a gift. Everyone gave the money, except for Paul . When she confronted him, he stated that he's been really struggling financially & big family issues. She tried to understand but for her it was not a valid reason and he should have tried to communicate instead of ignoring her. Paul owes me a significant amount of money too. Paul has been ignoring my texts for 2 weeks and being very avoidant at work. He finally replied and I was shocked. He stated that I should have said something to her and basically I am bad friend for not taking his side and he was more there for me than her (which is not true) & he's taking his distances from everyone as our establishment will close in 2 months.  I told him I didn't want to be in the middle of this (I have a past with this), you are both my friends and I simply can not choose. He is forgetting that I have helped him in the past, I was there for him. He didn't understand he chooses to stop talking & unfollowed me on social media. I don't think I will see my money ever again.  Laura has been very supportive, understood I will not take sides and our relationship has not changed.  I have lost a friend, but AITA for not taking the side & being more supportive ? Thank you for reading.  Edit: names for clarity",

So, I've been feeling down for a while and have not been able to pull my weight in our household.. so last night I pulled myself together and did my best to clean the floors downstairs since she was complaining she wouldn't get it done...I know this was due to my lack of action, I'm probably the jerk there, which is why I wanted to give her a worryfree weekend and do the floors for her.. I could only do the floors tho, no dusting or whatever... it's not even dusty since I did it last week..I even told her I would do them next week (I leave tomorrow for the weekend) My mom came back from school an immediately began pointing out what hadn't been done and said nothing about what I did do until I pointed  it out. This isn't the issue,the issue is that I woke up to use the bathroom and have to walk by her room, apparently she was awake and called me over. She started by saying how it bothered her that I cleaned the floors and it kept her up all night. I know how she is and this is usually how fights start, so it being 6am I was quite agitated as I was not in the mood for this so early in the morning. Anyway, she told me she does not appreciate what I've done, that this was not what we agreed upon, why didn't I do the surfaces like I was told, why did I clean the floors, now she's stuck spending the weekend dusting and so on and so forth. At this point I exploded because for the 100th time, it's obvious she doesn't listen to the words coming out of my mouth. I told her I was not doing this at 6 am, that I wanted to go back to bed before my alarm went off. Her answer? Then my day is ruined and I'll have to cancel everything because I can't sleep like this..  At this point I exploded and I might've evolved into the jerk.. I called (screamed) her manipulative and that I am not doing this so early in the morning. That I was digusted that she would be acting like this over me trying to do something nice for her. She told me I didn't do it for her, I did it for myself to manipulate HER and what was she supposed to do this weekend? Guys, I was honestly flabbergasted.... I was like anything you want?!  Apparently, she can't do anything she wants now because I manipulated her by doing what I want and now she has to dust and clean the surfaces... I.TOLD.HER.TWICE.AT.THIS.POINT. that I would do them.  The conversation was going nowhere and I didn't want the cops called on us for our screaming match this early in the morning, so I cut the conversation short and removed myself from the situation, which..made her even more mad but at this point I didn't even care, I was hurt and angry. Back to my room I went. I just.. I'm at a loss..am I really such a manipulative monster for what I did? Am I in the wrong? Was my thinking off? Should I have just done the stupid dusting? It may sound stupid, I know it does... So here I am..",

        "selftext": "For some context, this happened in the friends gc. I (18F) my friends; R(18F), L(18F), S(18F), J(19F) and M(18F). We all went to the same highschool. So about a day ago R had told us in the gc that S was going out with a guy that was interested in her. This guy Z(20M) had liked S for a long time, but I still felt weird about him. There was a rumor not too long ago that really made everyone in the gc dislike him but we found out that of course the rumors were fake. Still I felt weird about him. S had been talking to Z for a long time and says that his a genuine, nice, kind guy. Z had been asking S out to get to know her better and to finally talk to her in person but S would refuse but then finally she gave in. He even stated that if she felt uncomfortable seeing him by herself that she could come someone, which is what S did. They're probably on the that date right now as I am writing this. So when R told us in the gc that S was going out with Z of course people in the gc didn't see an issue since S had clarified time and time again that Z was not a bad person. Still as I said I still felt weird about him. I have a lot of trust issues with men since I've seen a lot of trashy men with the women around me. So I voiced my concern, I didn't know that this would turn into a whole agreement in the gc about marriage.  L and R were the one's that were going at it, I'd chip in here and there giving my two cents on the agreement but the argument ended, or so I thought. This morning the argument resurfaced again since L had told said, (my name) is hater of men so S don't listen to her My friends already know how I feel about men and this is a joke in the gc so I didn't take it the wrong way. We started joking once again me, R and L in the GC I had said, before you girls go looking for a husband or man with nothing to your name go look for money first I really just said this as a joke not think someone would get offensed to this. I left the gc after saying this since I have things to do around the house after a few hours I come back to the GC to see an argument between R and L. R was saying that before you get married it's better to be financially stable, L was saying that you just need to find a good man and saying that getting married doesn't mean one needs to stop improving themselves. After a while they found out that they were arguing about the same thing but just from different perspectives.  R asked L why they're even arguing to which L proceeded to reply to my previous comment about looking for money instead of getting married. She said it seemed that I had an inferiority complex to which R replied asking how. L proceed to say that it must have rubbed her the wrong way and the conversation ended there. I didn't want to say anything in the GC so I texted L privately asking her how my comment rubbed her the wrong way and how she felt. She is yet to reply to me and when she does I'll update you.

        "selftext": "Hello!  I (29, M) had an argument with my partner (29, M) over my decision to bail out of my partner's friend's wedding. Some background:I have a pretty bad social anxiety. I'm also not fully out of the closet and struggle with internalise homophobia (I'm not out to my family). I have not been fully comfortable with attending social events with my partner (weddings, parties etc.) as a couple because of my issues. I have made a few attempts but they did not go very well usually (I ended up feeling drained and stressed out). Recently we have been invited to my partner's friend's wedding (I don't know them well at all). He insisted it's important for him that I attend. I understood that and agreed. Recently, however a wedding of my cousin came up, which is actually on the same date as the other wedding. I am not that close to my cousin, but as everyone I am close with will be there, I think it's important for me to attend. Also, my parents made it clear that I should attend. I also live in a different country so I don't see them that often. I think that it is reasonable for me to attend the wedding of my cousin since it is my family instead of some other person's that I do not know well even though they're a friend of my partner. My parents of course do not know I have a partner, therefore I cannot say that I have that other wedding. My partner insisted that I lie to them and say that I am ill or already have a holiday booked, but I don't feel it's right (even though I needed to lie to them on some other occasions). To be honest, even if my parents knew about the situation, I still think it is reasonable for me to attend a wedding that is important for me and to spend some time with my family (and would actually be a bit weird the other way). Now, we had a big fight with my partner over this (the biggest so far). He is saying I broke a promise for an unspecified reason and that he does not want to attend the event on his own again. I however feel that because this is actually not because of my social anxiety or my internalised homophobia that I am not going with him, he is slightly overreacting. He says I do not care about his feelings, which is not true. I simply need to make a choice and this on its own is uncomfortable for me. AITA?",

        "selftext": "(Fixed for the people with no reading comprehension.) This is just regular teenage drama, but today I was talking with my friends. Let's call them Beck, Tanny, Hazel, and Abs. I was talking to Abs and Beck, recently Beck and Hazel have been having drama over a boy (of course) and Hazel has been dragging it for months now, Beck and I were talking about how Hazel kept dragging it and about what Abs told us about what Hazel has said about Beck. Now it wasn't good stuff, Hazel was saying Beck was a bad person and that she was a slut.  Beck and I decided to make a group chat with Abs to all talk about it and Beck decided to confront Hazel, Hazel claimed she knew nothing about it even though both me and Abs have heard her say it. After that was over me and Abs agreed to texted Hazel and say we didn't want to be friends her anymore. Since Hazel was the type of person to talk crap about people Abs and I assumed there was stuff about us too. We both texted Hazel and explained. My reasoning was that Hazel kept dragging us into unnecessary drama and that I was worried she was talking crap about us, there was also the fact that Hazel was extremely open about her sexual life with her boyfriend (keep in mind we are ALL minors). She got upset claiming she has never talked shit, then heres were Tanny comes in.  Hazel brings Tanny into the conversation and Tanny starts arguing saying that Hazel never talked shit and that we had no proof of any of our claims, even though Hazel is extremely public about her gossip and personal life. Tanny then started posting about us publicly. Not only that but she then started sending Beck threats to hurt her. Me being tired of the harassment, I decided to just block them. Now that I think about it, I don't really feel bad at all. But theres still the fact it sort of seems that it was me who escalated the situation because it was my idea in the first place to message Hazel and tell her I didn't want to be friends.  I personally think my reasoning was valid because no child should be having sex nor causing unnecessary fights and drama over small things, but I want to know if this makes me the bad guy in this situation. I knew she was struggling with mental health, I knew she had trouble with her parents, and I knew this would affect her, but I still did it. Am I the asshole for this situation escalating and affecting someone, or was I in the right to unfriend her? I'm most likely the asshole in this situation, but I just made this so me and my friends could turn it into one of those Minecraft AI YouTube shorts videos. Thanks for reading!",

However the project hasn't gone anywhere; there are only three people in the Discord server including myself and I've kept asking for updates every so often for the past five years, but I almost never get an answer. I'm tired of constantly being left in the dark. I've had a bad streak with voice acting projects; the ones I'm cast in almost never go through and the only reason one has gone through is that someone picked it up as co-director after the original one hadn't responded for months. But back to the paid one; this is my only paid role I've been cast in so far. And it just hasn't gone anywhere and I feel like I'm SO close to crashing out on someone. I want so badly to go off on them, but I'm worried about how this could impact me for future directors. I figured that I should get some input before making a decision, and so I wanna know; WIBTA if I did?",

I was in a higher end department store today (rhymes with loomingtales) and happened to end up next to two teenage aged girls while shopping. One of the girls had picked out a pair of VERY expensive boots and they were both fawning over them. Second girl must have looked at price tag and asks boots girl if she\u2019s really gonna spend that much on boots. Girl with boots says something along the lines of \u201cit\u2019s fine I have my dads credit card I\u2019m not paying \u201d which instantly caught my attention because THATS NOT HER CARD. I\u2019ve told my son multiple times he\u2019s never allowed to use my card so I\u2019m interested to see how this girl thinks she\u2019s going to get away with fraud but had split up from the girls at this point because they had found something else. We end up at the same register (me behind) and I see her total hit well over four digits. The girl is about to swipe her card when I decide that I can\u2019t let her get away with something like this and someone has to parent this kid if no one else will. I tell cashier that isn\u2019t her card but her father\u2019s and I\u2019m not sure she has permission. Girl and friend turn and glare at me giving me possibly the dirtiest look I\u2019ve ever seen. I swear this girl was going to throw a tantrum right there, I don\u2019t think she was ever told no. Girl tells cashier her father gave her the card to shop with because it\u2019s the stores credit card and it gives him the points. Now that I\u2019ve pointed out it wasn\u2019t hers cashier tells her she can\u2019t use that card. Girl tries to show ID to prove they have the same last name ( yeah that will help) and I tell her it\u2019s still fraud. Girl says it\u2019s not fraud because she has permission and tells me to mind my own business. I tell her that it is my business that she\u2019s doing something illegal she needs to pay with her own card or I call the cops. Girl is pissed now and people are glaring at me. She uses her own card and leaves crying. Cashier looks mad at me and I tell my husband when I get home only for him to agree I was in the wrong.  So Reddit, ATIA?",

Now the employee in question in very young 22 year old guy and has been with us for about 10 months now. He's a great employee and we were thinking about promotions in the next ~6 months for him. His job is a high paying one for a new grad, about ~90k with commission and base so we expect a lot from this position. Because of the accident we let him take a 1 month paid leave of absence from work and he's returned a few weeks ago and his performance is severely lacking. He's super unmotivated, not cold calling, out reaching to prospects for the last 2-3 weeks enough since he's come back. Our whole mgmt team has noticed this and we decided to let him go because we feel like he'd need months and months to be able to produce again and we can't just wait that long. We called him into a meeting on Friday afternoon and gave him the bad news, he was very calm and rude about it. Told us to go fuck ourselves and got up and went to his desk grabbed his few things and left. I thought this was very very unprofessional and extremely rude. I told my boyfriend about all of this and he said myself and my mgmt team are a bunch of asses and pricks with no hearts. AITA?  **Update*** Holy fuck this blew up, I know this was shitty of me now.

She gets angry and irritated for small things, insults me when she doesn't like the food I make, starts acting insecure and accuses me of losing attraction for her. For example, she wanted to eat chicken sandwiches for dinner last week. Well, I made chicken sandwiches. So she eats all the sandwiches, leaves me nothing and told me that they tasted like shit. I wasn't pissed because she left me nothing. But if she didn't like them, why did she have to eat everything? When I asked her this she told me that she was hungry. Ok fine. She does this every time. Eats everything I make and calls it shit. I don't argue with her because I work for more than 80 hours a week and I really want to have some peace when I'm home. So, yesterday, a random girl starts at flirting with me after the gym and asked me if I wanted to meet up with her for some drinks. I rejected her and told her that I was married. And when I got home, my wife started to hug me and apologise. When I asked her what happened, she told me that her best friend suggested a test for my loyalty. So they asked a mutual friend to flirt with me and asked me out. And I passed. Yay!!. I'm really pissed. I'm done with her antics. WIBTA if I ask her to move out? Edit: I don't live in the USA.

        "selftext": "I have been living with my new wife and stepdaughter for about 6 months now. She\u2019s 19, almost 20, and I have three sons aged 18, 16 and 15. She\u2019s a really good kid and she\u2019s a good influence on my sons, I really enjoy having her around. My wife and her daughter moved into my house and sold theirs. My stepdaughters father isn\u2019t present in her life, nor is my sons\u2019 mother. All four children share a bathroom. My sons have never lived for a long period of time with a woman, nor have any of them had long term girlfriends. They had short visitation periods when they were younger but never longer than an hour, so living with two women has been unusual for them.  My eldest son, 18, came to me last week and told me that his stepsister disposes of her used sanitary products in the trash can they share, but doesn\u2019t use toilet roll or sandwich bags to disguise what they are, and it makes him uncomfortable which I think is reasonable. My sons are teenage boys and don\u2019t want to see their stepsisters period products on full display. A few nights ago I went into the kitchen to grab a snack and she was there doing some work for university. My wife had mentioned that she knew she was on her period so I took it as an opportunity to have a word with her. I told her my sons were uncomfortable and asked her if she\u2019d mind putting her used products in diaper bags or flushing them down the toilet.  She laughed and told me it was rich coming from a man who \u201csheds like a gorilla\u201d and has produced \u201cthree skid marking sons\u201d which I thought was just an unnecessary attack. I\u2019ve been nothing but nice to the girl and it\u2019s hardly a comparison. My sons shouldn\u2019t be subjected to her unhygienic products if it makes them uncomfortable. She went on to lecture me about how tampons can\u2019t be flushed and that it\u2019s bad for the environment if she uses diaper bags for every one which I think is just an excuse. I called her a scruff and told her that this was my house and that what I say goes.  I later asked my wife if she could have a word with her and she told me I was being ridiculous and that her daughter has had her period for ten years and knows what she\u2019s doing. When I told her it was making my sons uncomfortable she said my sons needed to get a grip and turned over and went to sleep.  This is a genuine issue to me and she didn\u2019t care enough to have a discussion about it. I asked my stepdaughter again in the morning and she did the same as her mother, completely dismissed it. Both of them have told me to stop being so silly but I don\u2019t see how I\u2019m being unreasonable when it makes my sons uncomfortable. AITA? UPDATE \u2014 Not even two hours after I posted this, my wife and stepdaughter gathered my sons and I and gave us a full intensive \u201cperiods for pricks\u201d course, Powerpoint and all. It was a hoot, they made an interactive quiz and everything. My sons and I learned a lot and apologised to my stepdaughter. Thankyou for your input",

Ethan used to be okay with it til he started complaining about Mike taking it too far with his jokes. Some context about Ethan. He and his wife couldn't have kids so they adopted a boy Joey 2 years ago. Mike has been making silly, lighthearted jokes that involving Joey's bio parents as a way to mess with Ethan and his wife. I already talked to Mike and I tell you that he's 100%means no harm and he was just trying to get them to react. So fast forward to NYE, my parents hosted a big celebratory dinner and Ethan and his wife came. While we were eating dinner, Mike decided to tell a knock-knock joke to Ethan. He said Knock knock.. Ethan laughed and said Who's there?. Mike replied Joey's bio parents then he bursted out laughing. Silence took over and Ethan's facial experssions changed. His wife called Mike an idiot to which Mike replied with Hey...Relax it was just a joke. An argument ensued and dinner was paused. My parents suddenly told Mik to leave which I thought was too harsh. I tried to speak to them and get them to calm down but mom insisted that Mike leave. We left and Mike was complaining the whole time about how they overreacted. I called mom later and she told me Mike was out of line with his hurtful jokes about this touchy topic and told me I was wrong for defending him and saying he was just joking. She said he ruined NY for the family but I told her it was her and dad who ruined NY celebration for escalating the situation and kicking him out. I told her he could talk to them but again they were the ones who ruined NY celebration. She called me delusional for this statement and hung up. We haven't talked to them for days.

There really is no reason for us to choose truth since we already know a lot about each other so we mostly went just with dares. It was pretty fun and we had some weird challenges. I was staying next to my friends brother and when it was my turn a classmate challenged me to kiss him. His sister immediately told my friend to change the dare and so she did. To be clear, her brother did not say anything when he heard the dare and just laughed so he definitely looked like he was ok with it right? Well WRONG because after I kissed him he told me wtf I am doing and looked like he was really grossed out by it. I was honestly a bit offended and asked him why he is so grossed by me kissing him, I am actually a pretty ok looking girl and even if I wasn\u2019t, there was no reason for him to act like this. He ended up leaving the game and my friend told me that what I did was wrong on so many levels and to get out of her house. My other classmates didn\u2019t say anything so I think they were on my side but didn\u2019t want to participate in this argument (I will ask them when they go back home).

My son had a Minecraft world where he built quite an impressive castle on an island, which he was very proud to show to me. Since school was canceled, he has had issues with waking up on time. He is supposed to wake up at 7 each morning, but for the past month he has been sleeping in until about 9 or 10. I always set an alarm for him, but he sleeps right through it. I don't wake him up because waking himself up is a skill that he needs to learn. I told him about 2 weeks ago that there are going to be consequences for him if he continues to sleep in every morning. At first, he understood and was waking up on time every morning. But for the past week or so, he has fallen back into old habits. I told him yesterday that this is his final warning. Today, he slept in until 11. So I followed through with my warning, and went on the computer and deleted his favorite Minecraft world. I also took away computer privileges for the next month. When I told him, he started screaming and crying. He told me that he spent a whole year working on that world, and he's very distraught that he's never going to see it again. He has been crying and sobbing throughout the day, and has refused to eat any of his meals.",

My daughter (Anna) has recently started to date an African American man (Jamal). While I'm not exactly what you would refer to as liberal, he's a nice young man and as long as my daughter is happy, I'm happy. The problem is Anna is rather naive about the community she lives in. While her friends are quite content to see a relationship like hers, more than a few tongues are wagging in the community and a few people have privately expressed their concern to me. As I said, I have no problem with mixed relationships and I've set them straight, but I am painfully aware of how these matters are viewed by certain segments of the population. My parents are planning to come and stay with us for a week and Anna expressed a desire to introduce Jamal to them now that things were getting more serious between them. I told her on no uncertain terms that this wasn't going to happen. I may have no problem with Jamal, but they *absolutely will*, and even when the relationship ends they won't forget it. They might even go as far as to cut her off entirely. Anna was extremely upset by this and implied I was a racist and more concerned with what my parents think than how she feels. As I said, I know my parents. They simply aren't okay with mixed relationships and if Anna were to bring Jamal over even as a friend, they would be furious both at her *and* me. Anna is currently staying with Jamal and doesn't want to speak with me right now. My wife stands by me given she knows very well how my parents are (they had a problem with her for months over the *length of the skirt* she wore when I introduced her to them, for christs sake), but a close friend I confided in told me that I have behaved like an ass and that I needed to focus more on my daughter than pleasing my parents.

I figured while I wait for a text, I could post here to see if what I did was really that bad.  I'm a big fat ass, there's no way around it. I love to eat which probably borders on addiction but I figure since I'm only hurting myself it's probably better to just live my life. I have some great friends although there is no doubt I'm the harmless, funny token fat guy of the otherwise pretty good looking group. I guess that sets the stage enough.  Last night my friend hosted UFC and I was invited. He got a 6 foot party sub. I also brought homemade wings that are sort of my specialty. Well of course people flocked to the food and I had basically one serving of the sandwich but people devoured my wings and I didn't get to have a single one. Which is totally fine that's why I brought them but maybe an hour later I was starving. I kept eyeing the sandwich and I'd say there was about 3 feet of it left. I waited an hour, then another half hour and no one had touched it (but they were still munching on chips, pretzels and what not). So I was like screw it...I took about half of what was left and ate it. Then the last half sat for another 10-15 minutes and no one said anything so ate the rest.  Well to be sure as I was swallowing the last bite the host's girlfriend asked where the sandwich was. Like I was the guilty party pretty much everyone pointed at me. I guess they'd noticed me eating the sandwich. She was furious and said that I was an incredible pig and that I had been super selfish to eat 3 feet of a sandwich. I felt so bad I tried to explain to her that I really did wait over an hour and thought people had lost interest. I also tried to explain how everyone had ate my wings and she said something along the lines of you brought them to share Alan, if someone had eaten over half by themselves that's not fucking sharing is it?  I offered to order pizza or even go get subways and she said that it was a pathetic offer because the party sub had been from a local shop owned by her friends. I said I was sorry but the night was so tense from then on out.  I woke up this morning to several texts from my twin sisters (the host's girlfriend's best friends) saying that I had to get my shit under control and that everyone is really mad at me and that I embarrassed myself last night. I tried to explain to them what my mindset had been and they haven't responded.  Was I the asshole for eating that much of the sandwich last night? Edit: I guess I\u2019ve been banned from responding but my inbox has 1200 notification so I can\u2019t find out why. To answer what seems to be the most common misconception, this wasn\u2019t a subway party sub so definitely not 4x the size of a regular sub. This is a local place so it\u2019s about 1.5 times the width of a regular sub. Its still a ton of food don\u2019t get me wrong but I can down 5 subway footlongs in an afternoon easily; this is probably about equivalent to that, not 12 like some people are saying.",

I managed to get with a beautiful girl named Marcy when I first started getting into the thick of things. She knew who I was but she said she loved me.  I will regret this for the rest of my life, but I was the person who shot up Marcy for the first time. After that, there was no stopping her. She stuck around with me, probably because I was her dealer more than anything, but then I got clean and never saw her again for a long time.  A year ago she reached out to me on Facebook and told me that she had been clean for a few months and she said that she didn\u2019t hate me for what happened and she hoped I was still clean.  Last week I got a call from my sister who told me that she saw on Facebook that Marcy had OD\u2019d and there was a funeral service this upcoming Thursday. I immediately just burst into tears because I hoped that this would never happen and I feel so much guilt over it.  I want to go to the funeral service for her but I\u2019m afraid that my presence would be unwanted. At the most I would just slip in the back, pay my respects and leave.

        "selftext": "I have waited tables for the last three years. During my shift last night, a group of four women in their late 20s came in. They were a pleasure to have as customers. They ordered four of our house cocktails to start with and then went over the menu for their entrees.  When I was on my way back to their booth with the drinks on a tray, I walked by the back side and overheard one of them talking about how she was 14 weeks along. When I rounded back, they were talking about the same topic and it was clear to me that she was pregnant. I figured her having one drink wasn't a big deal. They ordered their entrees and I went off to handle other tables. About five minutes later, they called me over again and asked for another round. At this point I started getting concerned, but I took the order and cheerfully said I'd be right back. This time, I went to the bartender, and asked him to make one of them a virgin cocktail. He was confused but since he's a good friend of mine, I told him to just trust me.  A few cocktails later (hers strictly virgin) they started getting rowdy, and Mrs. Pregnant Woman was also getting into it. I figured that since she didn't notice, things were OK. The problem came when I took them their check, and they asked to split the bill at the register. When Mrs. Pregnant Woman got to the counter, I saw her cocktails were marked with (virgin). My bartender had edited each in the system for inventory. It was too late for me to edit them back, so I just had her pay, hoping that she wouldn't look at the receipt. They all thanked me and left, leaving a generous tip in the process. They were talking in the parking lot for the next short while, presumably waiting for an Uber. Several minutes later Mrs. Pregnant Woman came back and asked what (virgin) on the receipt meant. I fessed up that it meant non-alcoholic. She blank stared me for a few seconds and then asked if she had ordered a non-alcoholic cocktail. I said no, but told her that I assumed she wanted one seeing as she was pregnant. It was a lame lie and I'll admit it, but she looked me in the eye and asked me to return her part of the tip. I did so. Then she talked to my manager. My manager took me into her office and literally shrieked at me until hoarse.  I stood my ground and told her that I'm not going to be responsible for FAS. She told me that she was taking me off the calendar until she decided what to do with me. She also informed me that I could get the restaurant in serious trouble for discrimination, and upon examination of my state's laws, she is correct.  But when I talked to my mother and father about it tonight, they told me that they understood my position. The entire staff at the restaurant is against me and I think that I'm going to call in and tell my manager that I quit, but I still feel in the right here. I would like some perspective on this and if I'm the asshole here.",

        "selftext": "I have a big family that\u2019s incredibly close. We have big family dinners every few months where we all meet at my great grand fathers estate and eat together. Typically how this works is that the women go cook for the time they\u2019re there and the men don\u2019t. Which I am fully aware it\u2019s sexist as hell. That being said I am one of the youngest people in family and my protests mean literally nothing.  Some of those women choose not to cook, however this is usually met with a level of ostracizing. The women who don\u2019t cook are lives and long term girlfriends. So they kinda already have a good family relationship doctored in. When I have seen new partners not cook, it\u2019s gone bad. Like completely ostracized, not speaking, cattiness, rudeness etc. This dinner will be in two weeks and my girlfriend was asked if she would attend. Initially she said yes, which is great. I want for her to meet everyone and for everyone to get used to her being around, but when I explained to her the tradition she was understandably bothered.  I told her that I understood where she was coming from, however it was best for everyone if she just played along. I told her this isn\u2019t a permanent thing and that I am only asking her to do this so that she can avoid bad treatment from the rest of the family. This is her first impression and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s best if we cause waves. She told me that it\u2019s unacceptable and that if she has to do that she will not be going. I\u2019ve tried to find a compromise with her on this but she won\u2019t budge and she\u2019s pissed at me. She told me that if I think it\u2019s acceptable to make her do this I\u2019m just as bad as everyone else, while my point is that she needs to make a good first impression. AITA?",

        "selftext": "My daughter (14yo) posted a picture of a family get together on social media. A boy from school recognized her aunt from an adult film and messaged my daughter about it. I believe he sent a video to her as well. Before this, she had no idea her aunt was in the industry. It appears that boy spread this around the school and my daughter is being teased for it. I notified the school and they are looking into it and will plan to educate the students about sexism online.  My husband and I are respectful and non-judgmental of my SIL\u2019s profession and have tried to teach these values to our children. My daughter is understandably upset and I feel for her, but she is directing all her anger and blame towards her aunt. She unfriended my SIL from social media and removed all traces of her from her profiles. She refuses to join us for weekly dinners at my SIL house and when they come over, she ignores them and just sits in her room playing minecraft. I tried talking to her about tolerance, shame, and sexism, but it she is dismissive of all of it.  My SIL is hurt from all of this. Not only did she have her privacy invaded, but she lost a good relationship with her niece. Last weekend, I went upstairs to my daughters room to try and talk to her and get her to join us downstairs. My daughter refused and referred my SIL as \u201ca vapid slut\u201d and her husband \u201ca pathetic cuck\u201d along with other slurs I don\u2019t want to repeat.  I grounded her for three months and took away her internet. My husband definitely thinks that she should be punished for using that language, but that\u2019s too much. He also admitted he struggled accepting his sister\u2019s career path at first. He thinks she just needs space and will come around eventually because her aunt is family.  EDIT: Seems like my husband is right and I went too far with the punishment. I just never imagined those hurtful words coming from her mouth. I\u2019m going to scale it back to two or three weeks or something like that. Will decide with the husband later. We\u2019re definitely concerned for our daughter about what\u2019s happening at school and we\u2019re looking into therapy. For clarification, as for my SIL\u2019s privacy, she didn\u2019t consent to have her real name revealed to the world or have her films and her personal information be passed around by 14yo boys.",

I fell in love and married a Muslim man and had to convert to his religion. My family was pretty pissed off that I converted but we've kept in touch. Recently my sister announced that she was in love with a guy she'd met while trekking and they had plans to marry. My mom invited me for a 'girl's day', just me, her and my sister at my parent's home for a fun day. My sister began to talk about her fiance, how they hated each other at first but then fell in love etc etc. I was happy for her. It all began when I asked what religion he was. Imagine my surprise when she said that he was Hindu AND THE SAME COMMUNITY AS OUR PARENTS. This would mean that it would make my father absolutely over the moon. I asked her if she was sure she loved him, because it seemed unbelievable that she would meet someone from the same small community as our parents' and fall in love. She got angry and told me that she was absolutely sure she was in love with him. I suggested that maybe she thought she was in love because it was easy and there was no challenges involved. I explained to her that if she was truly in love, she wouldn't choose someone so obviously a match. It was as though our parents chose him from a catalogue.  She told me that it didn't matter, she loved him and thats it, and I was being rude. I told her that I wasn't, I was just looking out for her and didn't want her to bear the brunt of societal expectations on who to marry.  I then asked her if she was marrying him to appease our parents. At this point my sister blew up on me and began fuming that she was not a kid, she didn't need to appease anyone etc etc. At this point my mom told me(not her) to get out of the house. Later my sister told me never to contact her again, nor ever see her face or come to her wedding. She called me 'toxic'. I was just looking out for her.",

Our relationship has always been really good, but I hate seeing him in pain and admittedly try to avoid seeing him because it just makes me uncomfortable.  In November I\u2019m getting married. I\u2019ve been with my fianc\u00e9 for 4 years and he and my dad get on really well. Naturally the discussion of who was going to give me away came up in the family group chat, and I kept silent after I realised my dad would be in a wheelchair. We always talked about him giving me away and having a dance at my wedding and I don\u2019t want to be reminded of what could\u2019ve been at my wedding. I messaged my mom privately and told her I want my uncle to walk me down the aisle as we\u2019re incredibly close.  She naturally asked why and I told her that my dad being in a wheelchair would add complications to the wedding. The walkway would have to be widened to accommodate his wheelchair and he wouldn\u2019t be able to hold my arm or give me a proper hug. She was outraged, called me an ableist POS and removed me from the group chat. My aunt has since called me telling me my dad is absolutely devastated. AITA? Update - I appreciate all the people who have messaged me offering me support, your kind words have meant a lot to me whilst rifling through a bunch of messages telling me to do horrible things to myself. Regardless of what you think of me, telling me these things isn\u2019t okay. I\u2019m going to call my dad tomorrow Update 2 - can people please stop messaging me such horrendous stuff? think about what you\u2019re saying. You may not agree with me or my life but you\u2019re just as bad as I apparently am if you\u2019re going round saying stuff like that to strangers on the internet UPDATE - Not that I owe it to anyone but I thought I\u2019d give you all an update.

        "selftext": "So my situation is a little difficult so I thought I would confide in the good professional people of reddit. Couple days ago me and my brother we\u2019re hanging out late night doing regular guy things drinking, watching sports, etc. We haven\u2019t seen each other in maybe 5-6 years so naturally we started talking about life and what\u2019s been going on the past few years. Towards the end of our conversation we started to get to the \u201csecrets\u201d I mentioned something along the lines that I smoked weed for the first time and did various other substances (This was hard for me to tell because my whole life I was pretty much anti-drugs and such.) We both laughed about it saying \u201cJust don\u2019t let mom find out\u201d The joke died out after a little bit and then he just blurted out \u201cI cheated on my wife...\u201d At first it didn\u2019t register until I saw his face and he was dead serious. I for one hate cheaters, but I try to do my best not to judge anyone for their actions. He begins explaining this was something that happened about 4 years ago when his wife was always busy with work. She would travel a lot and be away for weeks at a time. He told me they were going through a tough time back then lots of arguing, not communicating, and that he felt really lonely. During this same time my brother met a girl at his local gym, started off as friends, slowly kept bonding and you guessed they did the sex. He told me this occasion only happened once and pretty much cut her off after that night because he started to feel guilty for a short while. Few months later his relationship turned for the better for him and his wife. Pretty much after his wife\u2019s travels slowed down his whole relationship has been great. They\u2019ve both gotten promotions, bought a house, more family vacations. (They have a kid) He told me life has been good to him now and he\u2019s just thankful things have finally worked out.  As stated before I hate cheaters and I\u2019ve always felt that the person being cheated on always has the right know. I know for sure this would probably destroy their marriage and there would be a fight for the kid. My heart tells me I have to tell her because it\u2019s the right thing to do, especially because I\u2019ve known my brother to cheat one other time on an ex-girlfriend couple years before his current wife. My brain tells me it\u2019s none of my business and I should keep my mouth shut. I don\u2019t want to see their kid go throughout that kind pain either. On one hand I betray my brother if I say something on the other hand I betray our close family friend because I know this secret and I don\u2019t say anything. I wish he never told me, ignorance is truly bliss. So there it is, WIBTA if I said something? TLDR: Brother Cheated on his wife years ago because he was depressed, now everything is better and he told me about it, but now I feel obligated to tell his wife because she\u2019s a close friend. WIBTA? Edit: I\u2019m referring SIL as close family friend because my family and her family have known each since elementary school days and thus are Very close lol. I thought this iteration would make the relationship sound stronger than just SIL, but it looks like I was wrong. Second Edit: Wow this is on the front page, I never intended nor expected this blow up as it did! I\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t reply to everyone, but there will be some kind of update.",

Our daughter has always been a little socially awkward to the point that we've had her tested since we suspected her of being on the spectrum. Turns out she isn't on the spectrum; she's just a natural introvert. However, this year in school we were thrilled when our daughter made a new friend her age since that is an area in which she struggles. Long story short she recently invited her new friend over (with our aproval) to have dinner at our house and then spend the night. So, my daughter's friend came over. My husband is usually the cook in the family and this night was no exception; he made us all a really nice meal. During the course of said meal I asked my daughter's friend; Are you enjoying the food? She responded Yes! [Your husband] is a great cook! No wonder you've ended up a bigger woman. The room got quiet for several moments. My husband tried to laugh it off and change the subject but I wasn't having it. The girl had just leveled a completely uncalled-for insult at me. My daughter's friend seemed to realize that she'd messed up but she didn't say anything else. We finished an awkward dinner in mostly silence and my daughter's friend did stay the night. This was a couple of months ago. Recently my daughter asked if she could have her friend back over and I told her Sure; if she's going to apologize to me. When our daughter asked what I meant I reminded her of what she'd said. My daughter responded that it was over and she didn't want to bring it up again. She then went to her father and asked. He said sure but she then told him what I'd said. He came to me and said: [Daughter's friend]  just felt awkward and tried to make a joke. It didn't land. For the sake of our daughter can't you just let it go? Yes, I could, but the thing is that I just want an apology from the girl. I need to see that she understands how rude she was before I can get on board with her and myy daughter hanging out. My husband says that I am being weird for insisting on an apology from a 14 year-old, especially since that girl is such a good friend of our daughter. I think it's weird that I'm still waiting for an apology from that same girl. Seriously. That's all I need. I just need to know that any friend of my daughter is willing to own up to her screw ups.",

I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement. I met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.) Our waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column. At the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me. The only one not happy was my date. She said, If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't. and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response. So pardon my french, but what the fuck?",

        "selftext": "So how to begin with this...I realize that on paper I am totally the asshole but when you dig deeper into my motivations I'm hoping its more of a grey area that anything else and maybe even I did the right thing.  When I was a teenager my dad bought me a classic 1972 Ford Bronco. It was my true passion and I don't recall a memory from high school that somehow doesn't involve that truck. Plus my dad and I would spend hours and hours working on it together and we went through that especially father/son rough patch when I was teenager it was always that Bronco that brought us back together. I made a huge mistake and sold the truck when I turned 19 and my dad died of a heart attack two months later so while not logical, I've always felt a karmic connection between the two events.  We had a baby in early February. she is our first and the light of my life. My wife is doing well but she's back at work and she's realized that she hates all the day cares we've tried and really wants to be a stay at home mom and plus she's still very hormonal from delivery, lack of sleep and breastfeeding so she's having a rough time and is angry a lot. I guess I need to say this.  Two weeks ago I was driving through our town's warehouse district and saw a Bronco that was pretty beat up but resembled mine. I stopped just for nostalgias sake and the owner came out and let me take a look inside. My dad and I had glued a wheat penny under the dash as sort of security measure so I just sort of checked and goddamned if it wasn't MY BRONCO!  I asked him if he'd ever consider selling it, he said actually someone was on I-25 as we spoke from Colorado to buy it for $21000. I freaked out and asked him if I could buy it right then and there for $23000. He said if I could come up with the cash, yes. I had been procrastinating setting up a 529 so I had $12000 in savings that my wife's parents had given us, I maxed out my credit card to Venmo and my mom bought down a check for $4000 and I fucking drove away in my old car. It was like a dream come true. Like a literal dream come true. It needs a lot of work I can't afford right now but it's mine. Like in my driveway mine. Again. I can't even describe what a joy this is.  My wife and her parents are furious with me. They feel I was deceptive, that a real man would have sacrificed anything and everything so my wife could go stay at home with his kids and that's setting aside that they gave us the money for a college fund. My point is my daughter is only 6 months old, we have 18 years to set up a college fund of her. But this Bronco means everything to me and if I wouldn't have acted it would have been gone forever. Now it can be that same connection between me and my kids. To me it's the literal meaning of happiness. Like I said on paper--asshole...whole story--grey area. How do you guys see it? Edit: had no idea this would go so one way. I guess I messed up. I talked with my mom and she is basically going to buy the bronco from me in order to refill the college fund and pay off the credit card. The $4k will be a gift and she\u2019s going to give me whatever I need to restore it. She\u2019s always been awesome to me and she\u2019s rather the money be spent now than wait for me and my sisters inheritance. Sorry to get everyone so mad at me, I was thinking with my emotions and acted badly edit2: are the \u201cmommy bailed you out\u201d comments really necessary ? I found a solution and it\u2019s coming from me and my sisters inheritance so it\u2019s not like I\u2019m not paying for it on my own eventually. Edit 3: my inbox is so buried I have no idea what those icons are that are where gold used to be. Does anyone know what those are ? Edit4: I\u2019m getting a 403 error whenever I try to respond, not sure what that means but I\u2019m still reading because honestly I\u2019m afraid to go home even with the great news I know my wife is going to be upset for one reason or another Edit5: does anyone know what 403 error means? I messaged the moderators but they must be busy /u/SnausageFest since you\u2019re a mod, do you know? I can\u2019t respond to any posts and get the \u201cstatus 403\u201d whenever I try. Thanks! Edit in the morning: I couldn\u2019t figure out why I was getting so many private\u2019s  but I guess this must be locked now. I didn\u2019t tell my wife that my mom bailed me out and lied and Said I found a buyer for the bronco. I\u2019ll figure out how to cross that bridge when I get there but my wife was so relieved that I \u201chad come to your senses\u201d I don\u2019t want to disappoint her. It\u2019s going to take all my lying skills to pull this one off over the next few years.",

        "selftext": "So my girlfriend (her 27 me 28) wants to go to this fancy new restaurant in the city that she\u2019s heard good things about. We get there and it seems like one of those hipster places but whatever, I\u2019m hungry.  I look at the menu and this place is crazy expensive - like every dish is more than $15-$20 and half the ingredients I\u2019ve never heard of. I order the bison steak ($26) and my girlfriend orders some weird pasta, noki I think ($18). Very important, these were listed as ENTREES on the menu. Mind you with drinks plus tip this is going to come out to over $60 which is already ridiculous for dinner for two people. So anyway we order as we are starving. My steak arrives and I am shocked, it\u2019s like 6 small pieces of sliced steak with some weird sauce on the side and a small handful of salad. I joke to the waiter \u201cwhere\u2019s the rest of my steak?\u201d and he explains they serve smaller portions at this restaurant because they focus on getting the highest quality ingredients. I don\u2019t care if this bison was blessed by the pope himself it\u2019s absurd to charge that much for such a small bit of steak, it\u2019s highway robbery. When I go to restaurants I expect an entree to fill me up and be enough for leftovers. I\u2019m complaining to my girlfriend and she\u2019s getting annoyed with me. Similar situation with her pasta it was like maybe 12 pieces of noki dressed up with some frou frou bullshit. Granted the food was pretty good but I can not get over how tiny these portions are. I\u2019m a big guy and I like to eat, what can I say.  When the waiter comes back I inform him we will not be paying for our meal, and that they are falsely advertising entrees that barely qualify as a light snack. My girlfriend is begging me to stop but that\u2019s where we\u2019re different, I don\u2019t let businesses push me around and rip me off.  A manager comes and apologizes but asks us to leave. I don\u2019t end up paying as they realized I called them out on their bullshit. My girlfriend is silent the entire time on the way back. Im still hungry so I drive through McDonald\u2019s and get a burger, and when I did that she asked to be dropped off at her place. It\u2019s now the next day and I\u2019m starting to think I didn\u2019t handle the situation as well as I could have (I could have probably just asked for a discount). My girlfriend hasn\u2019t responded to my texts so now I\u2019m starting to think I\u2019m an asshole. Am I the asshole?",

        "selftext": "Saw another post that reminded me of this situation. A few years ago, my close childhood friend gave birth to triplets. Her husband is a light black man. Of the three, two were the same skin tone as her husband, and the third was much darker. The skin tones made me a little suspicious that her husband might not be the father. I pulled her aside privately and asked her seriously if her husband was the father. She didn\u2019t even listen or answer rationally, she just freaked out at me and acted super insulted and kicked me out. I reached out to her husband and told him about her reaction and told him he should get a paternity test and he called me an asshole and blocked me. Neither has spoken to me since. I\u2019ve always thought that they dramatically over reacted and were probably hiding something because of their responses, but they\u2019re still married and sometimes I feel bad about what happened. I just felt a lot of empathy for her husband because I would be devastated if I wasn\u2019t confident that I was the father of my future children. Was I an asshole for asking privately? Edit- okay I get it I\u2019m an asshole. I want to make it clear that I didn\u2019t think the triplets had different fathers. I\u2019m not an idiot. I thought it was possible, given the skin tone of the third triplet, that all three were fathered by a darker man and the first two were a bit lighter because my friend was very fair",

        "selftext": "I had a party at my house last night. I have an antique slot machine from the 1940s that is in absolutely spotless and working condition in my living room. My step grandma was a show girl she she got it while dating a count room guy prior to meeting my grandpa. Over the years people have played it and maybe won a few quarters here and there. Maybe a max of $50 at a time. As far as I know the jackpot was never hit on it so however it works there was probably about $700 in the jackpot reserve that had built up over the years. I\u2019d never bothered to have it cleaned out since it just seemed like a fun novelty.  Well a friend\u2019s friend hit the jackpot last night. I was fucking floored when he legit thought he could keep my ~$700. His case was hed been playing with his own money and I would have kept his quarters. My argument  was I\u2019d be happy to give him his quarters back if he\u2019d asked but I\u2019m not a casino and while I\u2019m not destitute, I can\u2019t afford to give someone $700. Argument caused the party to wind down and one of my best guy friends basically told the guy he\u2019d be in real shit if he tried to leave with the money but the guy left threatening to come back with the cops and sue me in small claims court. I have no idea if that was realistic but no cops came back.  So was I the asshole for nor letting him keep the money? Edit: sorry guys I can't answer such witticisms as why are you so shity? because I've been banned. Edit2: wow since I\u2019m a \u201cbaby gangster\u201d who has been running an \u201cillegal gaming operation\u201d (both things that have been said) I might as well just go whole hog and start running guns and pimping underage Andean alpacas to people who would pay for the privilege. I\u2019m really that bad? I just thought I had a cool thing my step grandma got by banging a dude from the count room. Edit3: gotta address this one directly: >If this was really last night, give it a week or a month and see how many friends, especially mutual friends, are no longer talking to you. Forget our votes, listen to those. Also forget small claims, you need to worry more about hearing from your state's gambling commission. If the moderators allow me to update, I will ABSOLUTELY update and tell you how many friends I\u2019ve lost. Almost everyone  (including the friend that brought the \u201cwinner\u201d thought he was being a total asshole for the way he was down on his hands and knees scooping up quarters off the floor to put in his pockets. And he was lying about much he put into the machine too (he said $75\u2013who the fuck walks around, nuch less even get $75 in quarters\u2014when going to a party at a strangers house). In addition, I will gladly, gladly call our state gaming commission (AZ) and ask what trouble I might be in. I will also update on that when I can. People CAN\u2019T be this dramatic in real life...I\u2019m a ducking instagram influencer for my job, the phoniest, most vapid, saddest job a person can have right now and I\u2019m still blown away by some of these comments. Call me YTA all you like, but don\u2019t be stupid and claim to have knowledge you don\u2019t  in the process. Edit4: well I was banned for joking around, other people have bad posts calling me a cunt up for over an hour.  Makes INFO hard but I\u2019ll try to explain my thinking on the money in the machine and why I can\u2019t \u201cafford\u201d to give it to him.  Say you have a change jar, has $100 in it. Your good friend asks to borrow $25, for parking, you'd say yes right? Another friend says wow, that\u2019s cool I have $1.25 in my pocket, can I donate to your change jar? You\u2019d say yes. Now let\u2019s say a guy you\u2019ve never met says \u201chey I just put .80 into your change jar, now I\u2019m taking the whole thing.\u201d You would say no. It\u2019s how I\u2019ve always seen the slot machine as huge change jar for all my close friends to use. I\u2019ve given people quarters to play, I\u2019ve taken a quarter here and there from people who wanted to see it work. I\u2019ve taken in maybe $100 over five years. Maybe. That\u2019s a nickel a day. that\u2019s not a freaking illegal gambling operation. Edit5: a good question: >INFO Did he explicitly ask if he was allowed to play it, and keep what he wins? If no then he played it without permission, you aren't running a casino. No he did not, the first time I ever saw or spoke to him was when he was on his hands and knees picking quarters up off the floor slamming them his pockets.  I don't mind if people play it, I even give people quarters to play it (since no one has change anymore) but he did not ask. Edit6: another good question >Also, need more info. You stated that other guests have won small jackpots in the past (max $50). Did you let them keep it? If so, why are you making a double-standard here? I would have let him keep $50-100 (he certainly got away with some in his pockets) but he was such an asshole right away that he didn't give me the chance to come to any sort of deal. Most everyone at the party just wanted him gone. I do feel bad and maybe my guilt over the apparent double standard is why I'm asking here. But I do feel as though had he been even slightly cool and not threaten cops or lawsuits I wouldn't have been backed into a corner. Edit7:  >INFOWe need to know where the money came from. Did the money in the machine come from YOU putting it in or playing the machine So this is all guess work based on what my grandma said the jackpot could hold (there's a window that shows the coins in rhe jackpot, the space behind is about the size of a big shoe box). She said it gets full at $800. It was more than half when she and my grandpa gave it to me, I always guessed $500. In five years it's now 7/8ths full. I play it from to time to time so I'd say $100 of that is mine and $100 is friends. I think the jackpot and normal pay outs come from different boxes so last night was the last night I've ever seen that window empty. I know nothing of the machine or how it works or how to change settings so I may be so wrong and a slot machine nerd could correct me if I'm way off base. Edit8: this is the best yta take so far and I can't let it get buried. > I really hope you get into some serious legal trouble and then you\u2019ll wish all you lost was several hundred and not thousands including jail time. Edit9 (at 5:45am, gotta work): you guys are really cracking me up. I love the comments that say your edits make you YTA! Alone. Where did the money come from btw?  I truly can accept the YTA votes but so freaking many of them have basic facts wrong. 1. I wasn't profiting off this machine. I've literally never opened it up and taken a single coin out. 2. I can't afford to give a random dude $700. I don't need it now, but I have savings account I don't need it now either but I might some day. And now I've found out that some of the quarters that my grandma had from the 50s or 60s might actually be silver. So good thing I hung onto them right ? (I can't wait for the you're a stupid thot rationalizations to come from this one).  3. I never cleaned it out because honestly I like the way it looked with the coins in the window. This thing is enourmous and built with casino security in mind so it was in fact, a great piggy bank.  4. Some nice NTAs have suggested I have a bowl of quarters a for people to play. I actually in effect did that because 80% the time people who wanted to play didn't have change (I got it five years ago) so I always had quarters around, maybe just not right by the machine.  5. As an example, Over the years it's mostly friends kids who want to play. I had a very precocious 9 year old once come over with his $20 of money truly expecting to get the jackpot. He was heartbroken when he didn't win (I might have given it to him since he was so cute) but I gave him a $20 silver certificate my step grandma had given me (acquired ny dubious means no doubt) and that kid was thrilled. so I always, always give people money back if they ask. I never intended to profit off the machine. No one has ever made a big deal of it before (save the 9 year old). Edit10: this dude wins the comments, for all time: >I bet u look like jared fogle or some shit \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 Edit 11: sooooo the plot thickens, thank you to some very helpful people who own slot machines who DM'ed who were also able to suggest experts in my area, I was able to call a local person who works on antique slot machines. My slot machine is highly customized but it's based around a pretty well known model from that era (don't want to say exactly because only a few of them exist anymore) and he said I could tell right away if the machine was broken or had been tampered with. In my very, very, very amateur job of checking it over it does appear that this little piece is either broken or misplaced. So it looks like this piece of shit guest actually broke my machine to steal my money. There wasn't a jackpot at all. I don't have confirmation of this until the repair guy is able to come later this week but it looks like that's what happened. The guy said there's an outside chance that if that piece was broken or tampered with that it was an accident but he wouldn't bet on it.  I still don't care if I'm YTA till the cows come home, posting here has probably allowed me to get to the bottom of this. And fuck that guy. Edit 12: well the amazing and level headed moderators of this sub just ever so politely informed me that I will not be allowed to update this post. So the short story is the winner almost certainly was hitting the machine and caused the jackpot to spill out. So had I been a real casino I would have enacted the malfunction voids all pays and plays clause. So yeah, I was totally in the right. Fuck this sub. Fuck the moderators. And fuck those of you on your stupid high horse. Most of you however were cool.",

        "selftext": "I <30M> have a beautiful wife who loves to serve others. We bought a home down the street from my family. I have a sweet sister <17>Who likes to crash at our house with her friends.  My wife normally is pretty easy going until recently. My sisters friends have been leaving messes. Mostly towels on the floor after using our pool. My wife got upset picking up after them every day.  I have asked my sister to make sure the house is clean after they leave and it has been better. My wife also complained that some of her perfumes/Clothes personal items have gone missing.My sister said it\u2019s not her. I believe my sister. I just don\u2019t see her doing that. I told my wife and we agreed to just replace them. Last week my wife made a couple of pans of cinnamon rolls from scratch. One pan was for us, the second pan was for a co-workers family who is experiencing a tragedy.  My wife went to the gym. I went to work and my sister and her friends came by. The one pan wasn\u2019t enough for her and her friends.They wanted the second pan of cinnamon rolls and my sister texted my wife asking if they could eat them. My wife said no. They ate them anyways. My wife upset went and bought new locks. When I came home my wife handed me a new key and told me that she didn\u2019t want anyone else to have a key to our house. I tried to calm her down and tell her that I would just go replace the eaten cinnamon rolls with store bought ones. My wife decided this was her hill to die on and said no my sister lost the privilege to come when we are not home. Replacing stolen items wasn\u2019t \u201cgood enough\u201d anymore. My mom called and asked if my sister could use the pool as a back to school party? I was under the impression my mom would be there. I said yes, my mom was at work and our schedules clashed. The easiest solution was for me To change the locks back so they could come into the house. My mom didn\u2019t come with my sister. When my wife got home after the party. It was a mess. She sent me photos. She called me the A for changing the locks without talking to her about it. (Keep in mind she did too.) then told me I broke her trust. She wasn\u2019t safe in her home because she keeps getting robbed and I refuse to put an end to it. (I did talk to my sister). Then my wife let me know she was staying with a friend for awhile.  Am I the A here? I feel like I have tried to right any wrongs that have happened. Between my wife and my sister. Update* sorry I haven\u2019t been able to reply the past couple of hours. I have been busy. I talked to my mom again and let her know my sister isn\u2019t allowed over without me home.  I asked a friends wife who is a maid to come deep clean our home. So if/when my wife comes home it\u2019s clean. The last thing is my mom asked me to help cover my sisters cheer. She is on track for a scholarship. I told my mom I would pay half of my wife\u2019s things were returned. If not the money was going to replace the stolen items. Also my sister was invited to home coming. She wanted me to buy a dress. I told her no for not following our home rules and the money I saved for the dress is going to pay for the maid. I did replace the locks again. I also am planning a romantic dinner I will make and clean up. I heard a lot about the cinnamon rolls. Someone on here gave me the idea to make them. I am for a dessert. Update: my sister and my mom left a few mins ago. My sister had a bag of my wife\u2019s things. More than I thought was gone. Most items are in poor shape. The big thing is she had my wife\u2019s grandmothers ring I thought was in the safe. I had no idea it was gone. My sister said that she found it on my wife\u2019s night stand during the party. She forgot she had it on when she left our home. The ring isn\u2019t valuable it\u2019s just sentimental. I told my mom who the ring belonged to. My mom lost it. My sister is now grounded. Last update tonight, my wife is coming home. I am staying at a friends house. Until we can work some of this out. I already stated it but I did put the locks back on my wife bought. My family doesn\u2019t have that key. Early morning update, My mom called my wife last night and asked what my sister can do to fix/ replace the damaged items.My wife said \u201chave her meet me every morning at 5 am.\u201d I decided to tag along and see what my wife had planned. Trying to support her in whatever punishment she decides to do. You know the cinnamon rolls. My wife\u2019s co-works 4 yr old is in the final stages of cancer. My wife\u2019s plan is for my sister and her to prepare breakfast, get their other kids up and ready for the day. Start laundry, basic clean up. So her co-worker and his wife can spend as much time as he can with the sick child before work. My sister was silent the whole time coming back home.I can tell it really hit her that her life isn\u2019t as hard. Even being grounded. Last and final post, my wife has given me a second chance as long as I follow her list of rules.1) for awhile no family at our home2) no family borrowing our things. 3)no one is allowed a key4)I help with the chores around the house. Including cooking meals.5) last My wife is ok with me seeing my sister but asked that we all go to counseling to understand why my sister is targeting her. My wife said all of this has been really hard and she doesn\u2019t want to cause more issues but she just doesn\u2019t trust my sister and can\u2019t have her using out things.",

        "selftext": "Context: For every holiday, My mother would ask the women in the family (my sisters, sister in-law, my wife, my female cousins) to send samples of the desserts they plan to bring to the celebration for testing and to see if these desserts could make it to the food menu. My wife has been complaining about my mother deliberately rejecting every dessert sample she sent. So many times my mother has told her that she's being honest and keeping the guests best interest at heart. Yet my wife still thought that my mother is deliberately excluding her since 2 of her dessert samples were rejected before.  For this year's Christmas my mother is doing the same thing but this time, she told every woman who are participating to make a cookie sample and send it to her for testing. My wife took it as a challenge and to be honest she worked really hard to make a good sample and sent it to my mother days ago and the results just came in yesterday. I came home from work and found my wife upset. I asked what's wrong and she told me that my mother rejected the sample she sent and decided to exclude her baking from the food list/menu for christmas this year. I didn't know what to say but she then told me she was backing out of the invitation to attend christmas with my family. I was stunned when I heard her make this statement. I tried to talk to her but she said it was done I called her unreasonable to decide to bail on the whole family over some cookie sample...that's just freaking crazy and quite unreasonable. We had a full on argument about it and she stated that my mother caused this but I told her that my mother is pretty serious and careful about the food she offers to the guests since we are going to have relatives coming from all sides of country. She told me to stop mentioing it. Later I heard her cry despite telling her that her baking is amazing and people have preferences that's all.  AITA for insisting that her decision was unreasonable? Info. If you're asking whose cookie sample made it to the menu, the answer is my sister and my 2 cousins. Info Few things to put on here: 1. My wife wasn't the only one whose sample was rejected. We have SIL's (brother's wife) and my younger sister's. 2. My mother did not force anyone to participate, it was up to whoever wanted to take part. 3. This is just about the dessert since my mother tends to be very careful in this category but for other types of foods. Dishes/appetizers/salads/stuff like that is welcome as she stated. Update: Great!, so I just got off the phone with my brother and he told me that his wife is doing the same thing as my wife and that she has decided to back out of the invitation to spend christmas with family as well. Turns out my wife must've told her about her decision and she decided to follow her lead. My brother is pissed saying my wife is encouraging his wife to do this. I see that the problem has just gotten bigger now. Who knows, my younger sister might join in and decide not to go as well. I don't know how this got out of control so quickly. I guess we'll try to have a discussion with my mother about this soon and see how it goes.",

        "selftext": "Last week, I was using my sister Ashley\u2019s phone because mine was dead and I needed to call a friend to confirm plans. Dialing my friend\u2019s number, I saw a tinder notification of some dude messaging her. Immediately, I asked why she\u2019s on tinder (she\u2019s 17) and she grabbed her phone back and said \u201cnone of your business\u201d  I decided that I wanted to have a little fun with this. I wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt (maybe she\u2019s just swiping for fun?) so I didn\u2019t want to go straight to ratting her to our parents. To test if she was just using for fun, I decided I was going to make a tinder profile (of someone else) and message her and see if she responds. I asked a good friend from back in college (who happens to be a male model) Kevin if he\u2019d mind if I used his pictures and explained the situation. He thought it would be hilarious and told me to go for it.  I created the account, set my age to 22, set my swipe radius to a mile, and quickly found my sister\u2019s account. Her age was set to 19 (lie, she\u2019s still in **high school**) so I was definitely more suspicious of her now. I superliked and less than an hour later, she matched AND messaged me.  I decided to set up a date to a fancy restaurant downtown for Sunday afternoon and told her we could \u201chead to my place afterwards\u201d. She was completely receptive and said she\u2019d meet me there. She told our parents she was hanging out with one of her track friends and spending the night at her place.  After she left, I told our parents EVERYTHING and showed them all of the messages. They were pissed, and I suggested we all go to the restaurant. My dad and I just went instead and saw her sitting at a table alone all dolled up waiting for \u201cJim\u201d. My dad went up to her and said \u201cJim\u2019s not coming\u201d and she screamed and asked what we were doing there. I told her that there was no Jim and that it was fucking stupid of her to be trying to meet grown men on tinder at her age. My dad harped on to that and lectured her on lying and meeting strange men on the Internet, and being so willing to go back to a *stranger\u2019s* place. We were a bit loud so people were starting to look at us and my sister eventually bursted into tears and ran out.  I told my friends in a groupchat the situation and they all agreed it was hysterical, except 2 of my female friends who said I was a \u201cfucking dick\u201d and \u201ccruel\u201d to her. My other friends defended me and said she needed to be taught a lesson. Wondering who\u2019s right and if I went too far? EDIT: Yes, when I asked if she wants to go to my place afterwards, it was heavily implied that she would\u2019ve had sex with Jim. That\u2019s why I went the extent that I did. Alright after reading all these judgments, I came to the conclusion that I\u2019m TA. But I\u2019m TA she needed. If anything, she knows not to be a complete moron when finding people to hook-up with on tinder.  And to the people who said she\u2019ll never speak to me again, we just finished playing fifa for the last hour so \u00af_(\u30c4)_/\u00af",

        "selftext": "My husband has been working really hard the last two years to advance at his company and he finally got the promotion he's been after. I'm really, really proud of him. His parents are too and wanted to take us all out to dinner to celebrate. My husband absolutely loves prime rib and there's only one place in our area that serves it so he picked that restaurant. Thing is- I'm not fond of steak. I'll eat it but very rarely. I prefer chicken or fish. I looked up the menu before leaving and right now they have a limited menu. The place had only one fish entree and two chicken entrees, and none of them sounded good for various reasons. I suggested that he pick someplace else so everyone can eat. He refused citing that we rarely get to go to this place but go to other places in our area regularly which is true, but those places have lots of variety so everyone can eat. He suggested that I ask if they could prepare the fish or chicken without the marinades or sauces but I didn't want to be difficult for the kitchen staff. His next suggestion was that I order dessert while everyone else ate entrees and then when we were done, he would take me where I wanted so I could eat dinner while he and the kids ate dessert. So I opted to just not go because I didn't want to sit there not eating and not having a good time while everyone else was. My husband asked me to go so he could celebrate with the people most important to him. I told him no again and that he needed to get going before he was late. He did go but came back a little over an hour later with the kids and they all had to go boxes. He said he couldn't think of what to tell the kids about why I didn't go when they kept asking without lying or making me sound bad so he just got an order for them to go and let the kids spend some time with their grandparents talking in the parking lot. I told him he should had stayed but he said that I put him in a bad spot with the kids and that I knew he wanted everyone there and that I should've just gotten over my picky eating for one night. I maintain if he really wanted us to all eat dinner as a family then he should've picked a restaurant with a more accomodating menu. AITA? Update: Some of these comments were pretty harsh but a kick in the pants. I've apologized profusely to my husband and I am going to take him to that restaurant this weekend and buy him some camping gear he's been eying as a start to making it up to him and changing course.",

        "selftext": "Title says it all, sole provider for family, all credit cards maxed, negative bank balance, upcoming missed payments until my next check, basically destitute for the foreseeable future.  My wife and I usually decorate on Black Friday, but this year I don't want to.  The thought of putting up our fake tree knowing I'll have nothing to put under it fills me with such a mix of shame, anger, and pain.  I would prefer to just let December pass and cut out as many things as I can until I can get my finances under control.  Plus, my daughter is 2. She won't know, care, or even remember one missed Christmas.  So, AITA?  I'm already a failure as a husband and father, so what say you here? THIS HAS SPUN OUT OF CONTROL!  I never thought my sad man pity party would get this kind of response.  I was expecting to be called an asshole, validate my self loathing, and claw my way out of debt by working harder.  I did not expect the absolute torrent of love and support that I in no way deserve or can accept. INFO (And I am so sorry for not making this crystal clear in the original post): Our mortgage and utilities are paid.  There is food in our fridge and my next paycheck(s) is secure, even though it, too, will all go to bills with none left over for gifts.  I pretended not to notice that we weren't keeping up our pre-child lifestyle without credit cards and I got in over my head and now have to dig myself out of a relatively deep hole meaning I won't have money for gifts and meals out and holiday gatherings and whatnot for a good bit of time to come.  But, I have a great job and an outstanding family support system who all live close by and know what debt feels like and will understand if we can't chip in this year with anything but our presence, but it just felt shameful to have the advantages I have and still manage to fuck it up as bad as I did without asking for help.  As for all the people begging me to accept help, here is why I can't:  I make a good salary.  There is no chance of me or my family going hungry.  We have food and will have money for food budgeted into my paychecks, which are secure as my job is secure. I have an extremely well funded 401k from 18 years of office work and life insurance to safeguard my family.  Thank you all who were offering food.  Thank you all who offered to buy my 2 year old's amazon wish list.  She's 2 and does not have one.  My wife and I had already decided that she has too many toys and so we had only things like books and a learning tablet in mind for her.  She'll be ok if we can't buy her stuff.  She already has stuff.  Her close in age cousins live on our street and we exchange toys and clothes all the time and both our houses are cluttered with stuff.  This was not about garnering pity or soliciting charity.  It was my insecurity equating gifts with love that warped Christmas for me.  It almost ruined Christmas for me.  Regardless of the vote here, I truly am THE asshole for that.  So please, turn your charity to your communities, your neighbors.  Not some middle class jagoff who spent himself into debt trying to prove how much he loved a family that only needed him to be a happy and healthy presence at home.  You all have humbled me beyond words, beyond charity.  You have given me both the perspective and the courage to seek professional help, both financial and psychological, and hopefully it's not too late for this stupid old man to become a better father and husband.  Yes Virginia, there is a Santa Claus.  His spirit is truly embodied in all of you beautiful and selfless redditors.  Never lose the light.  Love and cheer to all.  But as you can see, I deserve neither your charity nor your goodness, and I'm going to go disappear back into anonymity now if possible and work on me. Update for those concerned:  I have not ever, even for a second, considered hurting myself.  Not once.  I'm showing my age here, but Goonies never say die. Update for INFO, and I hope this answers all the questions people had, as there were many, and so I'm just going to write a bio that answers them all:  I live in the Mid-Atlantic United States.  When we got pregnant (after 6 years of trying and failing and treatments and tears) we found out that it would cost us $50 a month for my wife to work her current job and put our daughter in full time daycare, as day care costs upwards of $1600 a month for even local co-ops, to say nothing of the $2100+ that most daycare companies were asking.  The solution was for her to retire and take up the even harder job of full time mother.  I work 8-5 at a day job and I pick up shifts DJing at a local bar at night and DJ private events/weddings/etc... when I can book them.  My daughter was about to turn 2, and be able to start 3 day a week preschool for far less than the cost of 5 day a week daycare, meaning my wife could work again, at least part time.  I was in the referral process to find a surgeon to do my vasectomy when we found out that despite using birth control, my wife was pregnant again. We're due in February, a little boy this time.  Utter shock, disbelief, some truly unhealthy thoughts, and finally acceptance that I was going to have to continue to be the full time provider, as there was no way we could put 2 kids in full time care, so once again, my sainted wife will have to spend at least another 2 years as a full time mom.  My wife and I are old people(42M, 40F) who tried to have kids earlier in life, but couldn't despite multiple treatments, and only succeeded when we stopped trying so hard and resigned ourselves to the thoughts of a comfortable dual income no kids lifestyle full of travel and memories, Bringing one life into this world at 40 after everything we went through was a laugh, only for life to turn around and bless me with a second child.  My wife is overjoyed, and I am happy but terrified of how I will afford this.  She applied for part time seasonal work to help with our bills, but the job she was hired for has given her exactly 2 shifts in 2 weeks, and taken one of those shifts away at the last minute due to overstaffing.  She has a meeting with them today to find out if it's worth her time to stay employed there, dependent on if they can actually give her at the least 20 hours a week which she requested upon applying.  We have had joint finances since we were engaged.  We don't hide things from each other, we're both well aware of our money issues and have been working on ways to improve our financial situation. (Thank you all for the links and sites, I am bookmarking them all!).  We have and will keep communication open.  It was our promise made to each other 13 years ago to never shoulder our burdens alone. Lastly (hopefully, I know this is long) I am humbled by your offers of charity, dear strangers.  Truly and deeply humbled.  I cannot accept them, be it out of foolish pride or some other moral driver, but know that your kind words and even kinder offers have softened my resolve to cancel Christmas this year.  I just spent 2 days with co-workers volunteering at 2 local food banks preparing meals, clothes, and groceries for the community, so if you're one of the many wonderful strangers who offered help, please give that help to your local charity.  I have a roof over my head, and food in my belly, and I could not ask for more, not when I have so much already.   I still dread the thought of lugging that old fake tree out of the laundry room, but my feelings have to come 3rd, here and always.  My wife and daughter need the love and joy that that old tree will bring, and I need to give them everything I can, even if it's the just the spirit of the season. They deserve to feel the warmth of a festive home, and we already own the damn thing, so it's literally the least I can do.  My presents will be the 1 million pictures my wife will take of our daughter pulling all the ornaments she can reach off the tree and showing them to her with that beautiful smile she has.  Our families are close by, and our parents will no doubt do their best to spoil our daughter and I know it will be more than enough. UPDATE!  Wife and I downloaded a budget app and are working with a family member who does financial planning. I, personally, spoke with someone (a professional) early this morning and in just the initial phone call she helped me realize that I was equating being able to give gifts with showing love to my family.  Not being able to afford baubles isn't going to mean I love them less, and I will need to accept that and I will continue to work with her as long as my insurance will allow.  Thanks to close friends with growing kids, we have an embarrassment of clothes and toys to sort through, and wrapping some of these items for my little girl to tear into is more than good enough for my wife and I.  My wife and I have plenty of clothes  Thank you to all who have offered to purchase things for us.  My heart bursts from the selfless and wonderful offers.  But, I meant what I said when I asked you to please point your humongous hearts to your local charities. I have more than enough things and taking things from strangers to compensate for my poor spending habits feels wrong.  It will be a tough few months, but I have a good job with opportunities to grow and am going to work with professionals to learn some much needed budget control, and work with a therapist to learn to accept help from family and friends when the new baby arrives and to be less hard on myself.  I am also going to spend more time with my local food bank, I signed up to help build meal kits this week to be distributed for Christmas in my community.  I'm planning on giving generously this season, just not in the consumerist sense.  I think that's a new tradition that my family can and will preserve for years to come.  Even y'all who called me a stupid cunt.  Thank you, too, for keeping me grounded. To those of you who have asked how could I have tried for 6 years to have a kid and not bothered to budget for it once it came are greatly underestimating how much fertility treatments cost even with insurance, and how well and truly fucked American Healthcare really is.  We are taking steps to ensure that this kid will be our last, and I actually brought up abortion but my wife would not even consider it.  Thankful for that now.",

        "selftext": "Title says it all. My friend is one of those girls who always has a boyfriend, and that boyfriend becomes a central part of her identity. Last night we were having dinner and she said she needed a new hobby because she didn\u2019t realize gaming could be so expensive. She dropped $2500 on a gaming rig because the guy she is dating now is into gaming, when before this she didn\u2019t even have Candy Crush on her phone. So I told her that she should find her own hobbies and interests instead of getting into whatever her current boyfriend is into. I reminded her that she enrolled in BJJ class when she dated a BJJ blackbelt (but she never stepped into a gym again after they broke up), she bought tons of baking tools and supplies when she dated a pastry chef (all banished to some faraway corner of her kitchen cabinet as I write this), she even wanted to buy a cobra when she was seeing a guy who collected them (Thank God the guy told her that she absolutely shouldn\u2019t do it). After dinner one of our other friends told me I shouldn\u2019t have said that to her and she clearly looked hurt, but I think that there was nothing wrong with what I said because I just pointed out facts and I think she needed to hear that to realize how dependent her personality is on her boyfriends and how ridiculous she is acting by copying their interests. AITA? Edit: Yep, I'm reading the replies, all 3K of them, it's all very interesting. Not gonna reply to any because reddit people can be weird, I know if I reply to a YTA with anything other than I'm sorry you're right people will say Accept your judgment! and if I reply Thanks to an NTA I will be told I'm just looking for validation. Shout out to @Durvillea who made the effort to DM me the same comment she made here, to quote: Looks like you are one of those girls who are always fat + ugly inside out that you have to be jealous with your rich + pretty friend who always gets attention from guys and has enough money foe different new hobbies.

I had no calls or texts from her, all I hope is that her last moments were painless and fearless. This year I suffered a near-death accident. After it, I did a lot of looking back on my life...and having lost family and friends in tragic ways I decided to stop taking things for granted and began cherishing the people I am close with.

I wasn't too over-romantic, but said I'll always miss you, and you will always be a big part of who I am. I hope you are proud of me. A few hours later though my wife texted me and was furious. She asked if I  loved her or if I wanted to get a divorce. She told me it was slap her in face to post my ex onto my FB. Of course I love my wife more than anything, and my intentions were not to harm her in anyway, so I felt guilty and took down the post. Was I out of line here? I genuinely didn't mean to hurt my wife, I just wanted people to know what a great person my late-GF was.",

My neighbor across the hall, a woman around my age or a little younger (I actually don't know her first name but I'll call her Katie) lives across the hall from me diagonally and has for about 2 years. We exchange hellos but aren't friendly, which is how it is with most of my neighbors. So I don't know how to cook, and due to losing one of my part time gigs, I don't have as much money for takeout anymore. I'm getting really sick of eating cheap fast food or box mac and cheese. I'm gaining weight and I never feel great. This is where Katie comes in. I can always smell her cooking in the hall and it always smells amazing (I know it isn't the other person at our end of our hall cause it's a single old man). I've even complimented it a few times. So I got the idea that I'd offer to give her some money each week to cook a little extra and bring it over to me (or I can pick it up from her!) at night. She's cooking anyway and then I'd have varied presumably delicious food. I asked her the next time I saw her and she looked surprised and said she couldn't because she was too busy (which didn't make sense cause she cooks almost every day but okay). The next time I saw her a few days later, I asked her if she was sure and upped the amount I was offering, and she said she was sure and that it was rude to ask me, and that she isn't a housekeeper for hire and I should get a housekeeper if that's what I want. She also called me 'a stranger' even though we have talked in the halls before. Overall she made me feel like a big jerk and really embarrassed for even asking her, and a little mad because she was acting like I was being creepy (I wasn't, trust me, she isn't my type). I think asking her to split cooking wasn't completely outlandish, since she cooks every day anyway and it wouldn't be hard to make a little more. So, AITA? EDIT: People keep assuming I'm sexist because I didn't think it was the old man who lives on our hall cooking. It's not an assumption for me. He and I have lived across from each other for 6 years. The cooking smells didn't start til she moved in, and I've talked to her about how good her cooking smells before. EDIT: Okay. It is abundantly clear that I was the asshole and asking her was inappropriate and, as much as I hate to admit it, creepy. My instinct is to apologize to her but since my instinct was to ask her in the first place, I'll do the opposite and stay out of her hair. Thanks.",

My husband had an emergency (dad had a medical emergency) and wanted someone to watch our son. he asked my older son and he refused because he was going out with friends. he also asked my daughter but she locked herself in her room to study. I was at the restaurant with my brother meeting his girlfriend for the first time. My husband ended up taking our son with him to the hospital and his mom watched him from there. He came home and was lashing out on everybody. Calling us selfish and unfeeling. I tried to explain that the kids were busy but he told me to get the f out with that bull because my older son could've skipped the hangout and watched his brother and, my daughter could've watched her brother while studying instead of locking herself in her room. He scolded me as well but I told him I couldn't leave lunch with my brother since he was visiting town and this was my only chance to meet his girlfriend. He yelled some more than told us that he was canceling the family holiday trip for christmas this year. The two older kids were upset and said it was unfair. I called him unreasonable to cancel the trip and punish the kids (and possibly me) like that. he refused to discuss it later. Now me and the kids aren't speaking to him and he's saying good riddance *edit My husband was supposed to watch our son at the time. That's why I went to see my brother at the restaurant. The kids aren't used to watching their brother when neither parent is home.* *update My husband just told us that he'll be spending christmas with his family saying he needs to be around his dad anyway. the kids said they will just go to their dad since they and my husband are still not talking. neither of the kids are happy with how things turned out. so I feel like things have gotten out of hand and the problem got bigger. He's now choosing to basically abandon us on christmas and also keep our son away from me and his siblings.*",

My dad and aunts have been involved in planning his funeral and they have been planning a very Catholic funeral service. He wasn\u2019t Catholic and wouldn\u2019t like the very expensive casket, the flowers, the church with a lot of people he didn\u2019t know there. He\u2019d think it\u2019s way too fancy, way too much.  He and I had morbid discussions a lot (side effect of me being a goth teenager, I guess). He told me he wanted to be cremated and his ashes thrown into a ceiling fan while \u201cIt\u2019s Raining Men\u201d played in the background...obviously not an option....Also, together we made up a funny funeral playlist, including songs like \u201cHighway to Hell\u201d and \u201cAnother One Bites the Dust.\u201d  To remember him, I want to bring a speaker and play \u201cAnother One Bites the Dust\u201d at his wake. I would explain it to the people at the wake and say that I wanted to preserve the person he was. Maybe I could give a speech, or tell the story and explain how he saw death with humor, not sadness. There will be a lot of extended, older family members there who weren\u2019t very familiar with him and are Catholic, so I\u2019ve been thinking maybe not. But I really want to preserve his memory as he was, not what people think he should have been. I think my cousins and sister would get a kick out of it.  WIBTA? Edit: I didn\u2019t really expect this response, but thank you. My brother would have been absolutely thrilled by all of your comments. I swear, I almost sense his hand in it. I don\u2019t know if anyone will see this update, but here goes,  This morning, I talked to my dad about the wake. I suggested, as some of you did, that maybe I could give a eulogy and talk about my brother, and then play a instrumental cover of the song. I found a violin one that I really liked. My dad listened to the cover and looked at the list that my brother and I made. He actually smiled and laughed, and said that it seemed like a great idea. I hadn\u2019t really been thinking about my Dad as much as I should have, I thought of him as opposition, I guess he cared way less about the Catholic stuff than I thought.  I also reached out to some of my brother\u2019 s friends. Some of them had already been planning a party in his honor and they were happy to listen to some of my ideas. We are going to play all the songs on the list, plus a few others that apparently he told his friends about and not me, and we\u2019re going to start working on logistics for scattering (not human!) ashes from a ceiling fan.

I knew from many stories I've heard that my daughter would probably end up being closer to him than me, since not only was our time together very limited but he was a stay at home dad, which means they had plenty of time to bond together which makes me feel sick to this day. This may sound immature but I made her promise to never ever call her stepdad(dad), that I was her only father and to not betray me. But I have no control over what she or they do in their home. Fast forward to now my prediction came through and she's obviously closer to her step dad than me. She has gotten engaged about a year ago and now that the wedding is approaching near(1 month or so)  she's now out of the blue told me that she wants both me and her stepdad to walk her down the aisle after promising me I would be the one to do it. Even though I know they're very close, I don't believe he has any right to walk my blood daugther down the aisle. I am her only father, it isn't fair that he got to be with my daugther more than me, her bio dad, and now he wants to take this moment from me too. I got a bit angry and told her I absolutely will not share an honor that is meant for me the actual father of the bride with some guy I barely know. She told me he's done a lot for her growing up and that I'm being petty over something that happened years ago. I told her I wasn't going to argue about it and if she wants her stepdad to walk her she can, but I won't be there to see it.  I was told by a friend of mine who uses this site quite often that many people have gone through something similar to this with their kids or parents, so I wanted to see other people's perspective, on if it's wrong for me to want to be the only one to walk my only daughter down the aisle.",

Can't help it and it has to do with psychological factors, childhood, and personal likes and dislikes. Before accepting their invite I let FMIL know that I wouldn't be eating the traditional food at their celebration, and showed her a variety of dishes to choose from to accommodate me. She refused and told me to bring my own dish. I said if I had to bring my own dish when I'm a guest then I better stay at home then. We went back and forth and I insisted I wouldn't come if accommodations weren't being made. I just thought it was a simple request and FMIL could've agreed if she really wanted me there. My fiance agreed that I shhould bring my own dish but I didn't. When we arrived there and I saw that no accommodations were made I got up, go my things and walked out and went home. My FMIL and fiance were shocked. I got tons of calls and texts from them both and my fiance came home lashing out calling me selfish and spoiled to walk out like that over a dish that his mom didn't have to make for me. and, that it was my responsibilty to feed myself. How is it my responsibilty to feed myself when I'm a guest? Makes no sense to me. I told him this and he accused me of starting shit and ruining my first christmas with his family and disrespecting his mom.  Now he's continuelly saying I fucked up and should've sucked it up for the family's sake. ETA to clear few points: * For those saying I have no respect for my inlaws. I do, especially FMIL. I respect her but this is so far the biggest conflict we had. * I work long hours even on holidays so not much time to cook. * I wasn't asking for an elaborated dish or several dishes.

Around that time, my son was formally diagnosed as autistic. He\u2019s not very verbal and prone to physical outbursts when he has a meltdown. He\u2019s been in therapies of every kind for his entire life and it\u2019s helped somewhat. Their dad had a life insurance policy which allowed me to stay home as my son\u2019s main caregiver while working freelance, but money was tight and finding anyone capable of watching him has always been a challenge.  My daughter was graduating from college last year. A week before the ceremony, she had an awards ceremony for academic achievement. I was obviously incredibly proud of her. She asked me to come to it and I said I would.  Her college is two hours from here. I hired a trained sitter who specializes in autism the day of the ceremony. Right as I was about to leave, my son had a meltdown and was lashing out at the sitter. I couldn\u2019t leave, and he wasn\u2019t calm for hours. I\u2019d left my daughter a voicemail saying I wasn\u2019t going to be able to make it.  She called back that night absolutely livid. She called me a shitty mother, said I had two kids but only cared about one, that I\u2019d missed every game and performance she\u2019d had as a child and it clearly wasn\u2019t going to change as adults and that she was just done. She said she knows he can\u2019t help it, but her brother is incapable of showing empathy and it made it hard to be around him without resenting him. She hung up and that was it. I\u2019ve barely spoken with her since. She didn\u2019t send tickets for the graduation we were supposed to go to the next week. She hasn\u2019t shown up for holidays and I\u2019ve heard she\u2019s engaged but didn\u2019t call to tell me. She\u2019s cut us out, and in the one of three times we\u2019ve spoken since she said it\u2019s easier for her to not have us around than be disappointed and that being alone at events is nothing new for her, she just doesn\u2019t have to bother getting her hopes up I might come now.  AITA - I\u2019ve offered family counselling and all other manner of things. I know I wasn\u2019t a perfect mom growing up - I didn\u2019t make it to her things, but not for lack of caring.

She died recently - aneurysm.  I've been with him 10 years now, but he'd known her for 20+. The way he tells it: They were friends in college, decided to date, got married, then realized they weren't a great couple and decided to just be friends. All that happened years before I met him. He was clear early on that she was important.  A couple months into dating, it came up that his *friend* was actually his *ex-wife*. He explained the above to me, saying she was one of his closest friends and that it was purely platonic. I expressed some discomfort at him being so close to an ex, and he told me That's fine. If you have a serious issue with it, let me know now and save us some time. I'll choose her. I like you and all, but I've known her for over 12 years and she's one of the most important people in my life. You'll have to be ok with that if you want us to be a thing.  When we were engaged I asked again. He gave me this perplexed look & asked Why would us getting married affect my friendships? I sucked it up & went along. I resented every moment of knowing her, especially when we had to be social. She understood some part of him I couldn't. Her husband was friends with mine as well, so it's not like I could use him as an angle. He'd have lunch with the ex, they'd go to their geeky movies, and whatever.  The few times I brought it up he said We had this conversation before. You had your chance to back out. She died after they had lunch the other day on the way to her car. He spent a bunch of time crying, but honestly I was relieved. He was working with her husband on funeral planning. I told him You don't think you're going, do you? My argument, summed up: She's dead, so she's not a factor anymore. He doesn't get to use his she's my friend excuse since she doesn't exist anymore. He had his cry for a couple days, he gets to be done with mourning her already. There's no need for him to go to her funeral, since I wouldn't want her at his. He was the angriest I've ever seen him when I told him that, replying that he'll be going no matter how I feel, and that he's willing to burn this to the fucking ground while holding up his wedding band. Besides you, she was the closest friend in my life. Him, her husband & my sisters are calling me an insensitive asshole over this, all saying that there was no romantic aspect to their relationship, & that I'm heartless. Her husband went so far as calling me a ghoul for how I've reacted. I never felt their relationship was appropriate, and I hid that for years because I wanted to be  with my husband. Now that she's gone, I don't feel I should have to hide it anymore, and can speak freely.  AITA for just wanting him to be *done* with her, and for him to not attend the funeral?",

That is, until a few days ago.  I love wearing jeans, and have always felt I could make them professional too.

I said \u201cWell, the girls get to wear jeans.\u201d \u201cNo they don\u2019t.\u201d Then, my coworker, Amanda walked in wearing jeans. I pointed that out. My manager confronted Amanda, telling her that she wasn\u2019t allowed to wear jeans.  In the moment, Amanda appeared playfully mad at me. But I went over her house last weekend, and she brought up the incident twice, again sort of playfully, but I think she may actually be mad.

        "selftext": "Update [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/b7vz7m/update_aita_for_very_rarelyalmost_never_wanting/)    I've been with my wonderful girlfriend for a few years now, and we usually get along great, aside from this current issue. You can skip to the TL;DR if the exposition is too long. She's a self-proclaimed foodie, which I honestly think is just selling herself short - she's a food genius. She can taste and smell a dish and then turn around and recreate it, or even make it better than the original.  If you taste something and wonder, 'what's that super subtle flavor?' she'll tell you, 'it's anchovy paste/sumac/lavender/some other obscure spice that you would never think of.' When someone is cooking something and they go, 'it's missing something,' she can tell you *exactly* what it needs. (It doesn't stop there, she knew I had *touched* a diesel truck at work one morning as soon as I walked into the house *that night* because she could somehow smell it on me. It's either really cool or really creepy, depending on the day.) That's not it, either. She *heard about a lost family recipe* and the next week, BAM, I'm eating my grandmother's homemade sausage again for the first time in fifteen years.  It's gotten to the point where I don't see any point in going out to eat, pretty much ever, except maybe her birthday. Even the most exotic ingredients aren't out of her reach, either, and, even though it's not about cost, I've saved up more being with her than I ever had in any other relationship. The only places we really go for date night is ramen - she can't figure out how to make the noodles, but she still tries so it's just a matter of time - and sushi. Our anniversary was recently, and I had noticed that our local fish counter was selling sushi grade fish, along with the rolling mats and nori, so I suggested that we have homemade sushi for our anniversary dinner before going out and she upset and said, I'm not learning how to make sushi because then I'll *never* get a real date ever again. We ended up going out instead. It kinda took me by surprise that she got so mad, though. She's *lightly* mentioned wanting to go out occasionally to places like Olive Garden because she likes the red sauce or other places because she likes the food, and now that I'm thinking about it, she's gotten kinda gloomy because I've asked her to cook on date nights instead of going out more often. She also brought up that food she cooks tastes better to me because she's tasting and smelling it while it cooks so her senses are dulled by the time it's served, but she has the most acute sense of smell/taste I've ever seen so I kinda think it's just an excuse. I just don't think it's worth it to go out and pay restaurant food prices when we can stay home for home food prices and have food that's just as excellent. TL;DR: So, Reddit, am I the asshole for not wanting to pay a restaurant to cook my meals because I practically have a private chef of my very own? Edit: it's not about the financial aspect of staying home vs going out, I just thought that it was worth mentioning because it's been more of a saving than expected. Edit 2: I'm taking her out tonight to grovel, guys. I'm also going to politely ask that, if she finds this off of Twitter, please don't smother me in my sleep for being such a dick Edit3: no, twitter, I don't buy her flowers, thanks for rubbing it in. I buy her herbs and succulents. What flowers do I buy a woman who likes to preserve them afterward? Also, yes, I wash the dishes #Final Edit: Okay guys. This will probably be my last edit. This post exploded unexpectedly and I've tried to respond to as many comments as I can, but there's just too many of you. If you've asked me a direct question and I haven't answered, I'm sorry. My inbox is a mess. I really took everything you guys gave said to heart, and I can honestly say that I've been an ass, and it's really hurt my relationship with my girlfriend. It's honestly a surprise that she's still my girlfriend after everything. So her mom picked up the girls and I took her out to a really nice tapas restaurant. She was very excited and seemed to enjoy herself, and I apologized for being stupid. After, we took a walk and everything seemed perfect, so I asked her to marry me. She said no. She did it kindly, but she still said no. She said that it wasn't a no forever, but she didn't want to commit to a one sided relationship and also said she doesn't think that it's fair that our relationship happens on 'my schedule' or 'my terms'.  I'm pretty heartbroken. I thought everything was pretty okay between us, but she thinks we should go to pre-marital (pre-engagement?) counseling and the division of labor needs to change over a serious sit down conversation. So, Reddit, you were all right. I'm the asshole who almost lost the love of my life, and most of you were right - it wasn't over restaurants. ",

        "selftext": "This is my throwaway account.  My (37F) babysitter (16F) has been babysitting for me for about 2 months. She\u2019s a very sweet and quiet girl and is good with the kids (4F and 8M), we\u2019ve only had small problems here and there but nothing major at all. When she first started babysitting for me I had asked her if there were any drinks or snacks that she\u2019d like me to keep at the house as she\u2019s here from 9-7 every day Monday through Saturday. She mentioned that she really liked seltzer water and I had bought them for the first month, but honestly I forgot after a while and never kept any in the fridge. A few days ago I bought hard seltzer\u2019s for me and my husband, and didn\u2019t think anything of it. A little bit after 2 pm she messaged me that she wasn\u2019t feeling well and thought that she may have to go home, if it was possible if I could get off from work earlier. I asked her to try and hold out until the end of the day. Not too long after she called me crying, saying that something was wrong and she had to go home. She was drunk clearly, she drank the hard seltzer\u2019s. I told her to leave and she walked home. She messaged me the next day and said that she now knew that hard seltzer\u2019s were alcohol, and she hadn\u2019t know, she never drank before as both of her parents were alcoholics and she has diagnosed PTSD regarding alcohol, she never planned on drinking in general. I told her not to come back as she put my children in danger. She called me crying and saying that she didn\u2019t know, and that she cared deeply about my children and would never ever drink with them, or at all, and that she needs the money to pay for her drivers permit (she comes from a not so well off family). I told her to find a real job and that it wasn\u2019t my fault she got drunk. My husband says I\u2019m being very rude and that she did try to reach out when she wasn\u2019t feeling well. My kids are upset to see her go. So reddit, AITA? Edit: okay guys, I\u2019m the asshole. I see it now. Thank you. I\u2019ll hire her again. Edit #2: I will pay her $1500 a week from now on. And pay for her permit and test. As well as her license test.",

        "selftext": "This happened last year but since it still gets brought up during arguments every now and then and I just discovered this Subreddit I decided to check what you guys think. Me and my wife have two children (15F & 11M). My wife is a stay at home mom since the birth of our second child. I (46M) work full time and earn a six figure salary. My job is highly stressful, requires me to travel a lot and mostly sleep in hotels. I only get to come home to my family on every second weekend, on average. Despite working a lot, I am glad to do it so that my family can live a comfortable life. Last year, I decided to buy my wife a Roomba for Christmas. My wife tends to be the one who vacuums the house so I presumed that she would like this present as it would free her of this chore. As she unpacked the present, she was heavily offended and did not hesitate to show it, which made the whole situation quite uncomfortable as my parents and other members of the family were also present. She argued that 'this should not be a present directed at her but at the whole family, as it is the entire family\u2019s responsibility to clean up the house'. Since I work and am the sole source of income in the family and she is a stay at home mother, I think it is apparent that she should take on responsibilities such as taking care of the kids and maintaining the house. The gift was intended to somewhat relieve her of this burden. I, personally, would have loved to have received a Christmas gift that would have somehow made it possible for me to spend less time working. As cheesy as it sounds, I think that time is one of the most precious gifts and that Roomba would have definitely bought some time for her - time that she could use to do whatever she pleased instead of vacuuming.  Unfortunately, one year later, this still often gets brought up during arguments, often coupled with her crying. So, AITA in this situation? EDIT: I should also add that I would have never gifted my wife a vacuum cleaner or anything along these lines. I saw the Roomba as a robot that would fully take over this task which is why I thought it was a good idea. EDIT #2: I asked her numerous times before Christmas last year what she would have liked to receive and she repeatedly told me that she does not want anything. I was left to guess and chose the most practical gift that I was certain she could be able to make use of.",

        "selftext": "I\u2019ve (m32) been dating Siobhan (f32) for 6 months now. She\u2019s always been very vague about what she does for a living (sati things like writing and working from home writing) but recently, one of her friends mentioned something and I finally dragged it out of her. She\u2019s an author, she write and self published romance and erotica stories and novels and while not rich, she\u2019s able to make a living out of it. I googled her name and couldn\u2019t find anything so I confronted her about this. She said she\u2019s writing under a pen name so I demanded she gives it to me so I know what she does. She refuses saying she doesn\u2019t want it to be leaked even by accident and no one knows. I accused her of not trusting me and she still refused which was really annoying. I tried nicer approach and told her that I want to know her fantasies so I can try it out with her and she told me that what she writes aren\u2019t her fantasies but her readers and she\u2019s still not going to tell me. At night I tried to check her laptop for her pen name but she changed her password before bed. I was annoyed and told her she clearly doesn\u2019t trust me and it\u2019s not fair because I have a right to know what she writes especially since it\u2019s a sensitive topic and I don\u2019t know her if I don\u2019t know her pen name. She was furious I tried to look on her laptop and told me to go home. Before leaving I told her when she calls to apologize, I expect to get her pen name with the apology.She called me an asshole on my way out. I thought she\u2019d call by now but she hasn\u2019t. My sister told me I was the asshole and I should apologize but I just don\u2019t see it and need. Second opinion. Was I the asshole?",

        "selftext": "So right now both of my kids (16 year old son and 9 year old daughter) and my ex are extremely mad at me because I won't give up my appointed time with them. My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time.   A little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't switch days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged.   Well, last week my ex contacted me and told me the good news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to think of them. I told him tough luck and hung up on him.  Well, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying ask them in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was not letting daddy take them to Disneyland. Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.  I'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being can't tell them the truth cause they already know it.   I'm so pissed right now. Am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during MY time with MY kids? How is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? ",

        "selftext": "In January of 2019, my husband was diagnosed with a brain tumour. It was in a completely inoperable part of the brain, and was told me had six months to live. He stuck it out and died in October, three months longer than he was expected to. He was always positive, and decided a few weeks after his diagnosis that he would write letters for our daughters for significant events in their lives. My husband was my soulmate, and the past few months have been difficult knowing I\u2019ve lost him  We have two daughters, Mia who is 21 and Imogen (Immy) who is 19. All three of us have become a lot closer since their dads death, and we\u2019ve all really struggled. My husband and I were together since we were children, got married when we were 18 and we were approaching our 20th wedding anniversary when he passed.  In February of this year, Mia got married to a boy she\u2019s been with for about 6 years. I absolutely love her husband and he\u2019s been incredibly supportive during all of our grief. My husband wrote a letter for Mia to open on her wedding day. It\u2019s worth noting that my daughters were unaware of these letters, it was my job to give them to our daughters.  Her wedding day comes around and I just can\u2019t bring myself to give her the letter. I read it and just wanted to keep it to myself. I had his handwriting and his words and it felt like he was there, and I couldn\u2019t bare the thought of giving that up yet. I was fully intending on giving her all the other letters as the events happened.  Last week Mia and her husband bought their first home together. They\u2019d been living at our home since they got married, and so had a lot of stuff to pack and move to their new house. Mia asked me where her important documents were, passport, birth certificate etc, so I told her they were in my top drawer of my dresser in my bedroom. The only letter that was in there was the one I was meant to give her on her wedding day, the rest were hidden away.  She immediately recognised his handwriting and of course it was addressed to her, so she read it and broke down. She came and found me and started screaming at me asking how I could be so selfish. I didn\u2019t really know what to say apart from the fact that I wanted to keep it and she could take a picture of it. Both my daughters called me an asshole and are convinced I\u2019m keeping them from a load of their dads stuff. AITA? EDIT - have your opinions, that\u2019s why I posted this. But do not come into my PMs and tell me I should\u2019ve been the one to die instead. You\u2019re worse than I am if that\u2019s what gets you off. Sending me death threats isn\u2019t okay either",

        "selftext": "My daughter (14) had anxiety problems ever since she was little but it was not severe. 3 months ago, my daughter changed drastically. She stopped eating, talking to us or her friends and her marks dropped. We were really concerned and her teachers strongly suggested we take her to therapy which we did and she was diagnosed with severe depression and social anxiety which was expected. The therapy sessions look like they helped her well, in the first month she already began making progress and started talking to us and her friends again and is eating whatever her mother is cooking. We were really happy to see this and every day she would get better and better. The thing is, her marks did not. They are terrible and she ended up barely passing the year. This is what infuriated me and made me cancel her therapy sessions. I know to some it might sound terrible, but paying $120 per session and seeing no progress in her marks makes me feel like I am seriously wasting my money (now that she returned back to normal). Not only that but since she really enjoys going to therapy I think telling her that she needs to get higher marks to continue her therapy sessions will motivate her to study harder and thus score better marks. My wife disagrees with my logic and we had a massive argument because of it which ended up with her saying that she is going to pay from \u2018her money\u2019 which hurt me since I see my and her money as ours. My daughter is also really upset on me and was begging me to keep her therapy sessions but I think I am going to stick to this plan. AITA here? EDIT: I deeply apologize for my ignorant replies and for hurting so many people. Please know that I had no intention in offending anyone and it was so upsetting to see how mental illness has affected many of you. I hope you guys can overcome this one day.

        "selftext": " 2 weeks ago my son [Ethan, 27]and his wife [Jess, 30] bought a small one story house in the town we live in. After settling down they invited us for a small party for the occasion. We sat for dinner and talked about the house a bit. Me, my husband and Jess continued conversing after Ethan excused himself to take an important call. Jess showed me the original key to the house and I asked if she made copies yet and she said no. I said she should and also give one copy to me as well. She looked at me funny and asked why she should. I explained that it is necessary so that it could be used in emergencies. she rudely said I don't know what kind of an emergency that would require you having a key to our house, sure won't be a fire incident!. She obviously didn't seem to have any idea that a fire incident wasn't what I meant and I got offended by her sarcasm. I pointed out that it's not just her decision because this is my son's house as well. She smiled at me trying to be polite and stated that only the ones who contributed towards the house get a copy and that I really don't need one anyway. Also assured me that my son will have the same answer for me. Basically saying Don't bother bring this up with Ethan, he'll tell you the same thing but I did and she spoke on his behalf the entire argument repeating what she said over and over. Things escalated to her calling me pushy and me telling her she was being unnecessarily rude and disrespectful . My husband and I left in a rush and I felt horrible. My husband went on and on about how paranoid and controlling I was to basically be demanding a copy of the key to the new house but again I stated that I was just trying to be helpful and taking extra precautions since anything could happen but he insisted I overstepped and ruined Ethan's and Jess's joy for their new house as well as dinner. I genuienly do not think what I said was out of line and I'm not sure why Jess reacted so intensely. I think my request was innocent.",

She slept over at my place last night, and in the morning she woke me up saying she had went out and brought back a couple of lattes and pastries from a coffee shop around the corner from my apartment for breakfast. My issue with this is that my apartment has a two factor entry, first my student ID to scan in and then my key to get back into the apartment (it auto locks). I asked her how she was able to get back into the apartment and she said that she grabbed my keychain (which has my ID on it in a wallet type thing) before heading out to buy us breakfast so she would be able to get back in. I told her that I didn\u2019t appreciate her violating my privacy like that, and she got upset, saying that she was just trying to do something nice for me. We started to fight about it and I ended up asking her to leave. Since then, she hasn\u2019t answered any of my texts or calls. When I told my roommate about this he said that I was the asshole because she did something thoughtful for me and I yelled at her about it. I think she was violating my privacy by stealing my keys. AITA? Edit: I thought it was weird that she took my keys without asking, they could have gotten stolen or something while she was out, I get that she was being nice but why couldn\u2019t she have asked?? Edit 2: and no she still hasn\u2019t responded to me Edit: I\u2019m at work now obsessing but I know that I screwed up. I had a bad experience with privacy in my last relationship and i guess I\u2019m projecting or something. And no, my girlfriend hasn\u2019t responded to any of my voicemails or texts besides sending back money I tried to send her for the breakfast last night but she might not be awake yet, it\u2019s early in my time zone Final edit because people keep messaging me: long story short, she texted me and we met for coffee earlier this afternoon. I brought her flowers and apologized for being insane. We had a long talk about my privacy issues from my last relationship.  She chose not to break up with me, she will be getting lots of dates and back rubs in the future. Also, I am already in therapy but thanks for suggesting it",

        "selftext": "So I (f26) have a boyfriend (m24) and recently he got into a dispute with the neighbour's kids. They accidentally kicked their football into our yard and they came into the garden to get it back. Tbh, I didnt care but my boyfriend started screaming at these like 11 year ds about how they are poorly raised and their parents should be ashamed. I. Was. Fucking. Mortified. I sent the kids some chocolates and sweets and apologised profusely for his behaviour.  I was seeing red flags and told him this behaviour was NOT normal. He kind of brushed me off and I told him if he pulled anything like that again he was gone.  The next week the ball came into our garden and I was about to throw it back to the kids when my boyfriend stormed outside and took the ball inside. I told the kids that I would bring it back in a minute. He went into the bathroom and emerged like 10 minutes later wearing gloves and a football covered in shit. HIS OWN SHIT. WHAT THE FUCK. I asked him if he was out of his fucking mind but he stormed past me and threw it over the fence screaming TAKE THAT YOU BITCHES. I screamed and girl I mean screamed at him about how he was a fucking douche and I wanted him out of my house and he is a disgusting fucking monster and that they were just kids. I screamed and screamed and eventually he left. I deleted all his games off of his ps4 and gave it to the kids as an apology. I was so embarrassed. My ex-bf's mom messaged me asking what happened and I responded with What happened? WHAT HAPPENED? You are a pathetic excuse of a woman who raised a fucking sociopath who covered a football in his own shit and threw it at some kids and he needs to be a in a facility because something is wrong with him and god knows how I hadn't seen any red flags about the fucking monster you raised during the 7 months we dated. I know I am in the right for what I did to my bf but am I in the wrong for snapping at the mother for something she had no direct involvement in?",

We\u2019re from England, where the correct response to rain is to not acknowledge it, but things are a little different in Japan. It is impossible to walk outside without getting fully soaked. I warned my friends of this and stopped at a shop to buy an umbrella. They were reluctant to get one; either underestimating the rain or thinking they could get one later, if it actually rained. I warned them multiple times that if it rains, I would not let them borrow my umbrella. One friend had a raincoat so was mostly fine but the other did not. I reminded them that I would not share a few more times while we were walking.  Roughly an hour later, it started raining. Hard. It was unlikely to stop raining any time soon and we had a train to catch so we walked in the rain for half an hour to the train station. I stood by my word and refused to let them use my umbrella (which could easily fit 2 people under it). When we arrived, the friend without the raincoat was completely soaked, and the other was far from dry. Neither were particularly happy.

        "selftext": " Hi. A couple of weeks ago we had a new employee hired at the company. he's a good guy and a widower named James (36) and to my knowledge his late wife passed away 8 months ago. Me (f32) and the other coworkers got along well with him. However I noticed that he is still wearing his wedding band on his finger. It kind of confused me a bit and I couldn't help but bring it up with him while on lunch break. We talked and I pointed out that he was being misleading by still wearing his wedding band when he's a widower. He looked quite bothered by what I said but I tried to explain that I think that he was giving people the wrong idea or impression about his relationship status since he's technically single and on his own right now (don't want to sound cruel but I'm speaking from technical angle).James said that he didn't give it much thought (meaning he don't care what people think) and that even if he wasn't wearing his wedding band and some woman approached him he'd still turn them down since he's obviously not interested. For some reason things got awkward and everyone stopped eating and just stared at James and me.I told him I don't know but that really really felt generally misleading of him as in making people think he is in a relationship (married) when he is not regardless of how he felt about being in a relationship. He got upset, called me rude, and said that I repeatedly disrespected his marriage and his late wife's memory with what I said then took his stuff and walked away. My co workers said regardless of who is right or wrong (though some said he overreacted) there was no reason for me to bring this up on the first place and cause a scene and make James upset with us like that now he's not speaking to me and others who sided with me. AITA? Did I overstep or did he overreact? This was just a conversation we were casually having with the other co workers and I didn't use any insensitive tones or anything but we had a discussion and it suddenly turned into an argument. I tried to let things calm down but the situation got out of my hand unexpectedly.",

These past few weeks I decided to eat my cupcake before going inside. She asked me where my cupcake is and I told her I don't like cupcakes anymore so I only bought two. It worked for a while but last night when I was enjoying my cupcake before going inside she caught me and ran to her mom to tell her how much of a Terrible dad I am to steal her frostings for weeks She is sulking and my wife thinks I'm the ah and I'm acting childish and should just let her have it but it's easy for her to say when she has never given up HER frosting. AITA? Edit: everyone is taking this very seriously lol. My daughter is not an entitled spoiled brat. Honestly I think she doesn't even love frosting that much she only does it to annoy me. I made this post because my wife likes this sub so I wanted to show her that I'm not the ah Edit2: a lot happened since I posted here. My wife is getting a divorce. She says she can't live with a liar. Cps came to our home to take our child away. They said we are terrible parents for letting our child eat frosting but by the time they got here our daughter wasn't home why? Because the cops came and arrested her for stealing a car. They said frosting thieves always become car thieves so there is no need waiting. She should go to jail asap. When she got there she called me and said she is going nc because I lied to her and she can't trust me anymore. Meanwhile we are getting calls from her friends telling us horror stories about our daughter bullying them. Our life is ruined. All because of a cupcake Nahhh lol So my daughter and I had a serious conversation about this problem and we came to an agreement. She said she'll stop stealing my frostings if I stop stealing her chips so we're good XD Edit3: some people clearly didn't realize second edit was a joke because I keep getting no this didn't happen its fake messages.

Her bedroom used to be right next to our tiny living room. To make our tiny living room into a normal sized living room, we knocked out my daughter's room's wall, refloored the space and fixed the walls. Now it looks like the bedroom was never there and we have a spacious living room. When my daughter came home to visit and saw that her room is gone, she made a huge deal about it. She got all emotional and said if we never wanted to let her move back, we should've just said so instead of completely demolishing her room. I told her that if anything happens and she needs to move back, we will welcome her and she could sleep on the couch as long as she wants. But she accused us of wanting to get rid of her forever and for her to never visit us since we got rid of her room so fast, only a few months after she moved out and we should've waited longer.

        "selftext": "Where I live, real estate developers have started snatching up family homes, bulldozing them and building enormous 2 million dollar houses on the plots of land. The houses also stick out horribly in terms of aesthetics \u2013 think single level brick homes with a 3-level gigantic white and black box in the middle. My home\u2019s been in my family for several generations. We have always been known for having a large, beautiful garden. We invited over kids to help with gardening, we gave away so many veggies, we\u2019d hold parties, etc. It\u2019s been a neighborhood treasure for years. Until developers snatched up the lot next door, bulldozed and erected an enormous house that blocked out the light to most of the garden. Many of us tried to fight it with the city but everything was denied. It was heartbreaking. Our neighborhood has been changed forever. This was a link to my family and I almost have had to go through a grieving process for it. The new owners moved in and were not welcomed warmly by people in the neighborhood. I avoided them for as long as I could, other than politely waving or nodding. It was a young couple in their early 20s. We finally came face to face and the woman asked if we could chat. She said that they felt like maybe they\u2019d done something wrong when they moved in, or if they aren\u2019t pulling in their trash bins or something, being too loud, etc, because people haven\u2019t been very friendly. The guy says that he\u2019s surprised considering it felt like a \u201cnice\u201d and somewhat \u201caffluent\u201d neighborhood, and given the price, he was expecting friendly neighbors. I asked if they had done any research about the area. They said that they moved from California, so no. I said that maybe that was their mistake? They said they didn\u2019t know what I meant, so I asked if they\u2019d ever looked in our backyard. They said yes and said they think the garden is cute. I said \u201cYes, the garden that now has about half less sunlight than before that house was built was a neighborhood treasure. The guy said \u201cWell it\u2019s not our fault you built the garden there, is it?\u201d I said \u201cWell, you guys got what you paid for. 2 million dollars for a house that everyone in the neighborhood hates.\u201d I said that I hoped it was worth it and wished them a nice day. When I told another neighbor about the exchange, she told me that she does feel bad for them moving without having any idea what they were getting themselves into.

She doesn\u2019t talk a lot and when she does talk, she\u2019s so quiet that you can barely hear her.  She used to eat in her car but one of my friends felt bad for her and invited her to eat with us. I noticed that all of her lunches had a little piece of paper and she\u2019d read it, smile for like 2 seconds, then fold it up and put it in a pocket in her lunchbox. Sometimes she\u2019d take it out and read it a couple times during lunch. I eventually asked what it is and she said she has a nanny and she writes her notes every day. I asked if she thinks that\u2019s a little embarrassing because I don\u2019t know anyone who\u2019s had notes in their lunches past 5th grade.  She got kinda defensive and said that her nanny does similar things for her siblings, who are all in preschool or elementary school so it kinda proved my point.  She started eating in her car again and one of my friends got mad at me because apparently she had a really bad home life before moving here and she\u2019s never had anyone do that stuff for her.

        "selftext": "Let me preface this by saying that I (24m) and my gf (32f) who we'll call Liv, have been seeing each other for close to a year now. I've been living in a shared house with 8 blokes in a small 2x2m room that barely accommodates a single bed. This is the sole reason why she doesn't sleep at mine. I'm saving a lot on rent living here even though the living conditions are poor. Now, I've been staying at my gfs house 4 nights a week for the past few months. Her beds bigger for starters and I cant cook at home because it's always congested, so Liv and I cook a meal twice a week at hers. She has a roommate who we'll call (Bianca) that she's known for quite a few years and they get along fine. I've tried my best to get to know Bianca but it's not reciprocated and I can feel the awkward tension between us a mile away. She's never asked a question about what I do for work, or anything of the like, and typically responds with one word answers. Liv told me that Bianca feels very uncomfortable living with me. I hate being the cause of her discomfort. Whenever I'm at Livs house, I don't use the living room and go straight to Livs room whenever i arrive (usually late after work). Besides cooking with Liv, I'm usually mindful of my time spent in the bathroom. Here's where Liv and I may have screwed up. We were taking a shower together and took a bit longer than usual (20-30mins). All of a sudden Bianca comes out of the room and slams the front door shut and sends Liv an angry text about taking too long and that she needed to use the bathroom and that she's selfish etc. We both put ourselves in her situation and said we would've knocked on the bathroom door to ask us to hurry up if we were busting, but she's a bit more timid than we are. Their relationships gone down the gutters since I came along and I can't help but feel responsible.  On an end note, Liv and I want to move in together within a few more months after her lease finishes, but for now we're stuck in this predicament. My mates telling me I'm an asshole for staying over 4 days a week rent free and I should respect the roommates boundaries and not see her as frequently. But I see it as the next step before moving in together, that I'm only there at night and it's normal for couples to see each other more frequently before they move in. So AITA?",

        "selftext": "Upfront, my boyfriend has an awesome penis. Its not huge or anything, about seven inches (we measured) and fairly girthy- but it is really, really- even comically small when its flaccid (like 2 inches). In the privacy our relationship, I playfully make fun of it all the time and he doesn't mind because he knows that he pleases me in bed. However, he has complained in the past about how much he hates locker room moments when other dudes see it and assume he is hung like a grape even though he is not.  So the other night we were having dinner with friends and played a game where we pull word cues out of a hat. One of the cues was something like, things that are short and I write down, my boyfriend's penis. They were all read aloud and when its revealed that I wrote that particular answer the room explodes in laughter. My boyfriend tries to brush it off oh you got me! Ha ha and laughs with everyone else, then one of my boyfriend's male friends (who he goes to the gym with) slaps him on the back and tells him oh we've all seen it, we still love you, bro! more laughter. After we get back to his place, my boyfriend tells me that it bothers him that his friends think of him as the small guy because all they had seen is his flaccid penis in the locker room. He said that they've made fun of him in the past and he has had to brush it off for years because he feels that denying it would make a bigger deal out of it than it is and has to silently take it. He said that by making that joke, all I have done was reinforce the perception and that it will just fuel the teasing. He wasn't mad, just disappointed. He said that he would never make fun of me if I had something unappealing about my body because he would never want to give me a negative impression about myself, that he would tell me I was beautiful no matter what.  I felt really, really bad when he said that. I have apologized and things are fine now but I think that maybe he is blowing this out of proportion? Am I the asshole or should he maybe not take this so seriously? ",

My family isn\u2019t broke, but we\u2019ve never had people working for us, and it made me super uncomfortable. Like, who am I to have someone serving me and cleaning around me while I sit there? I can\u2019t imagine if my mom were witnessing that. She\u2019d flip.  So I got up and started to help her tidy up. She thanked me for the help and told me I really didn\u2019t have to worry about it, but I told her it was no trouble (it really wasn\u2019t, we were just sitting watching TV.)  Later that night my girlfriend\u2019s parents asked me not to help the maid clean because it was a boundary thing and her work was her work and guests are guests. I told them it made me really uncomfortable to have someone clean around me and they just said not to worry because she\u2019s paid well and has been with them a long time.  The next day it happened again and it made me so uncomfortable I said \u201chey let\u2019s go outside\u201d to my girlfriend but she was busy on her laptop. So eventually I couldn\u2019t help it, I had to jump up and help her out.  Her parents walked in and looked pissed and my girlfriend finally clued in and ushered me outside.  I\u2019m still so confused by the situation. I\u2019m not sure if I was in the wrong for helping her clean or if I\u2019m in the wrong now for not helping her.  My instinct is to help, but when I do people get pissed, so, if you understand the dynamic better than me, please clear this up.  Am I the asshole for helping her clean?",

It will be around 100-150 people total. My husband and I are paying for this all ourselves, as well as my grandma who said she doesn't care one way or the other on this issue. She just loves weddings. We have a lot of kids in our family so we decided against making it child-free but we did decide to make it dry. So there will be no alcohol of any kind at our wedding. Honestly, this doesn't have anything to do with there being kids there but due to the fact that my fianc\u00e9 and I don't drink. Nothing against people who do, it's just not for us and we don't want to. On top of that, we only really drink water. We rarely, if ever, drink soda so most of the time it's only water with the occasional juice and milk. We don't even drink coffee.  So obviously the food (which is a part my grandma is not paying for) is going to be expensive for that many people. We are having our wedding catered so everyone will have a good choice of food to choose from but to drink only water will be provided. We don't want to have to pay for alcohol or soda, it is just an large added expense when we can just do filtered water for a MUCH cheaper cost. Well, when family and friends found out being got angry. Some didn't really care but some are really upset about it. Saying that I can just have an open bar so I don't have to pay for drinks (we could, but still have to pay for the bartender and we just really don't want to bother with alcohol there). Or we should at least have soda because how can we expect everyone to drink ONLY water? The kids will be upset. The wedding will be boring. That this is not how weddings work. Etc. So AITA? I didn't think this would be a problem! It's only water. I mean, don't most people drink water everyday anyway? Should we pay the extra to have soda to make the family happy?",

We have been dating for awhile now and she\u2019s always been courteous in asking to eat or use my stuff, she doesn\u2019t eat much so I always gave her the okay. After she had spent a week at my place I told her she doesn\u2019t have to ask me to eat my food on day 3 since she would always ask before she ate, she doesn\u2019t eat much since she\u2019s smaller but I didn\u2019t take into account that a handful of granola, a bowl of yogurt, and a banana every day would stack up after awhile. She left my place after the stay and now every time she comes and stays for a period of time she eats my food. I feel bad for wanting her to start buying her own groceries to keep at my place since she consistently takes me out for food, buys me clothes, contributes to groceries when we cook, and keeps my weed supply full. I can\u2019t comfortably afford to be feeding one and a half me\u2019s so often though since she\u2019s here at minimum 2 days a week. She has brought up in the past the fact that she feels I don\u2019t take her out enough but we have a quiet understanding that she makes more than me since she works 5-6 days a week and I work 3 (not by my choice). I feel like she contributes a lot monetarily to the relationship and in terms makes her feel like she contributes more emotionally in the relationship because she\u2019s always making sure I\u2019m taken care of and comfortable. I don\u2019t know if I should just suck it up because she\u2019s not taking much from me and if I\u2019d be wrong or an asshole to expect someone who gives so much to give me more. WIBTA? Edit: wow. I think making this post was one of the single most worst decisions of my life. My gf uses reddit and by sheer coincidence found this post, thought \u201chaha this reminds me of me and JoyceManner!\u201d, saw my username, made the connection, and broke up with me. All within 20 minutes of making this post! She thought there was underlying issues in our relationship and me being a cheap asshole was the last straw that broke the camel\u2019s back. Edit2: to answer some repeated questions: I made this as a throwaway account. The account name is based off a pretty popular band (Joyce Manor) I like so, I didn\u2019t think she would realize it was me. I\u2019m 26 and she\u2019s 20. Her name is not Joyce. I don\u2019t think she\u2019ll come on here to give her side of the story. Tl;dr: I am the asshole.",

This made my family feel let down especially my sister who wanted him there and also her 18th birthday was a big deal to her obviously.  To my surprise, When I arrived I noticed that my husband was having his meeting at the same place, his table was right in the corner and he had about 4 men sitting with him. My parents and the guests saw him as well. I waved for him and he saw me but ignored me. He obviously was as much as surprised as I was.  My parents asked why he didn't even come to the table to acknowledge them after the cake arrived. I got up and walked up to his table. I stood there and said excuse me, my husband was silent when I asked (after I introduced myself to the clients) if he'd take few minutes to join me and the family in candle blowing and say happy birthday but he barely let out a phrase and said I don't think so, I'm busy right now. I insisted saying it'd just take a couple of minutes and that it'd mean so much to my sister. He stared at me then stared awkwardly back at his clients. They said nothing and he got up after my parents were motionning for me to hurry up. He sat with us while my sister blew the candles and cut the cake. My parents insisted he takes a piece and join us in the selfie but he got up and walked back to his table looking pissed. We haven't talked til we met later at home. He was upset and starred scolding me infront of my parents saying I embarrassed him and made him look unprofessional and ruined his business meeting. I told him he overreacted since it only took few minutes and it was my sister's birthday and my family wanted him to join since he was literally in the same restaurant. He called me ignorant and accused me of tampering with his work but I responded that ignoring mine and my family's presence was unacceptable. We argued then he started stone walling me and refusing to talk to me at all. FYI) I didn't have an issue with him missing the event, but after seeing that he was already there then it become a different story. Also it literally took 5-7 minutes. He didn't even eat nor drink.

She takes pictures of food before we eat wether it's lunch or dinner and post them on her insta account. to be honest, I'm annoyed by having to wait so long for her to get the perfeft shot of the food after decorating it, adding this fork and removing that salad dish. It just takes so long and I lose my appetite from just waiting til she's done. This has become the norm but yesterday, I decided I was having none of it. I came to found that she has cooked an entire feast as her next cooking project and put it on the table. Note that by lokking at the whole table setting, I figured pictures had already been taken, right? but no, she said she was gOiNg to take few pictures and I had to wait. She went upstairs to get her camera that's when I grabbed the spoon and started filling my plate from every dish she's made and ruining the look as a result. I was hungry and unwilling to wait around for 10+ to eat. She came downstairs, saw the damage and blew up almost crying saying I just ruined her cooking project that she worked hours for as well as putting efforts into. I said I was hungry and couldn't wait but she kept yelling how much of an obnoxious jerk I was for not waiting til dhe took pictures of the dishes she made, Even said that this was an AttEmPt of me to Sabotage her success. I said oh please enough with those conspiracy theories, I'm just hungry and couldn't wait til she got the perfect shot. We had a big argument and shewent upstairs crying. I finished my food then went out to cool off a bit. When I returned she'd threatened that she'll never have me eat anything she cooks and said she'd rather throw it in the garbage then give it to a ungrateful, obnoxious jerk like me. I said this wasn't cool but she told me to go fuck myself. I said fine then went to spend the night in the guests room. she texted me the word jerk about 15 times til I turned my phone off.

We have a few atheist friends who have a general dislike for religion so I thought it would be for the best to only invite them to the party. My future wife and both of our families are Roman Catholic. Catholic ceremonies are *long*. I'm talking 1 hour of pure mass and additional half an hour of the actual getting married part. If you are not a believer, it is boring af. Hell, Im Catholic and I know I'll be bored for 80% of it. I thought I'll spare them the trouble. Anyway, one of my friends brought it up, saying I forgot to put the time and the church where the ceremony will take place on the invitation. So I said that she doesnt have to come to the religious part and just come for the wild party part. She got confused, I explained and she got annoyed to say the least. Said she isnt heartless and would sit through the 2/3 to see me get married in the 1/3. I tried to explain again & fix things but I felt guilty the whole time.  Was it an asshole move? Edit: ah, I suppose I am TA. Just for clarification though: - we did explain things and they are coming to church. No hard feelings between us.  - those who I decided to spare expressed anti-religious-events stances in the past (not going to Christenings, First Communions & Confirmations) so I thought it translated to wedding ceremonies - i also thought it would be considerate to not force them to come because of the sense of they invited me so i have to and ended up going wrong about it :/",

She'll breastfeed in front of us. Visiting our parents? She'll breastfeed. Going out in a public setting? She'll sit on a bench on the park and breastfeed. Go out to a restaurant? She breastfeeds. Every where. I've never spoken on it because I know she'll get mad and offended but when she did that on my wedding I lost my cool. During the reception dinner she just did it again. I kindly approached her and asked her why she didn't bring formula or at least bump milk out and put it in the bottle so she wouldn't have to do all this at that moment. She said because I don't have to. I feel comfortable breastfeeding. Getting milk out on my own is more painful I said she could just make this sacrifice and compromise for one day instead of doing this in front of 250 guests on my wedding. She then said she can't do much about it now, because the baby has to have her milk. I told her she should be more thoughtful of that then instead of completely embarrassing herself and us by doing this. I told my wife what the deal was and she said I'm an AH and should immediately apologise to my sister. My parents also sided with my sister and now pretty much everyone thinks I'm an AH since I'm the only person who had a problem with it. The only reason I decided to call her out is because I considered it a bad etiquette and tacky to do that at a formal event and that she could just find another solution for that night. AITA?",

        "selftext": "Longtime lurker here. Hoping some of you guys can weigh in on what has become a really frustrating situation with a close friend and his partner. So my wife (29F) and I (29M) have been hosting dinner parties a few times a year for as long as we\u2019ve lived in our current city. We like to go all out and cook elaborate multi-course meals, so we limit our invitations to just a few close friends, since cooking such a complex dinner is an all-day affair and the food costs add up quickly. We have about four to six people we invite to these events, depending on their availability, and it\u2019s become a great tradition in our social circle.  Our friend James started dating his girlfriend Sarah about a year and a half ago, and when we first extended her an invitation, we were informed that Sarah was vegan. I thanked James for letting us know and said she was more than welcome to bring her own food so she would have something to eat. He agreed, and the two of them have been attending our parties regularly for the past year. Everything was fine, until now. During our most recent dinner this past week, we noticed that Sarah was very quiet and looked like she was about to cry. My wife asked her what was wrong, but she told us not to worry about it and kept dodging the question, so we didn\u2019t push the issue.  However, after the meal, James took us aside privately and told us that Sarah felt hurt because we never provided any dishes she could eat at our dinners and it seemed like we were deliberately excluding her. He added that he thought we were being rude and inconsiderate by not accommodating her, which really pissed me off, and we got into a huge argument over it.  My wife feels terrible that Sarah was so upset and apologized to her and James profusely, but I don\u2019t agree that we did anything wrong. I like Sarah very much as a person and I don\u2019t have anything against her dietary choices, but I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s fair to expect us to change our entire menu or make an entire separate meal for one person, especially when so much time and effort goes into creating these dinners. For the record, nobody else has any dietary restrictions. AITA?",

So, I've always known my son had an interest in men. He was slow on the pick up of incognito mode, and from the searches he made, I figured he was at least Bi-curious (if that's the proper term for it) since he hit puberty. Well, last year, he started bringing a boy around, and it was obvious they were dating, to the point I figured that he knew I knew, and it wanst a big deal to anyone. Well, apparently, I was wrong. After school yesterday he and his boyfriend came up to me and said there was something really important they needed to tell me. My son said that they were dating and had been for a year. Well... I was surprised that he wasn't aware I knew and was a bit thrown off. My mouth moved faster than my brain and I said Well, thats pretty fucking gay. Now, I thought it was peak comedy, since it is infact gay. However, I understand using the word gay in that way gives it a very negative undertone, hence the mouth faster than brain comment.  Now my son and I are usually pretty edgy with our humor, this being fairly tame for the stuff we joke about. While probably not appropriate for the situation, it wasn't our norm for a conversation between us. However, he and his boyfriend were very, very upset and left.  I'm probably the asshole but I thought I would check, and see if yall had some advice on what I can say to fix it. He currently won't respond to my texts or calls. Iiiiii did not expect this to gain so much traction. It's a bit intimidating, lol. I am reading all the comments, though. Anyways, here is a small update - Hes at his grandparents' house, which I knew. He told them to tell me he'll be home tomorrow after school to talk. I'll update you all after the conversation.

Before I met him I was engaged to my former fiance Martin, but we broke it off because this relationship was sort of pushed by my family because he's a doctor and comes from a wealthy family. When our relationship ended mom was devastated. She did her best to bring us back together, For example she lied to Martin about me being pregnant to save us. That was years ago now we're all on good terms including Martin. Mom has a bit of tension towards Scott, she treats him well but constantly makes passive, nagging comments about him. She compares him to Martin all the time which bothers both of us but we try to let it slide. Mom kept telling Scott about the diamond ring, new car, and bank account Martin got for his fiancee and kept sending him photos saying how generous Martin is to his fiancee than compared him to Scott and what he had done for me. I told her stop doing this and she apologized. Last week, we were over at my parents house for a social gathering, lot of relatives came and we had dinner. At dinner table mom asked Scott if he saw the text she sent him the other day, he said he was sorry and that he didn't notice. She told him to check it right then and read it out loud so everyone at the table could hear. He took his phone and started reading the text out loud. Her text mentioned how Martin got his fiancee a new house and how generous he was, then said that Martin is younger than Scott, yet was able to buy a house. Basically shaming Scott for his inability to buy a house. She wrapped up by saying that Martin maybe wasn't so bad for me afterall. I was shocked and Scott was pissed obviously, however, he didn't lash out or anything he looked at the text, smiled and said you know, what gets me about this entire text is how you were a public educator for 30 years, yet you can't differentiate between the passive you and the contraction you're, Good God! The thought of all the children that must've been left behind!. Everyone at the table busted into laughter and mom's face went pale. She decided to leave the table then she and my sister started yelling at me saying Scott was being awfully rude and I need to get him to apologize immediately forembarrassing mom at the table. I refused to tell him to apologize then pointed out how she was being judgemental towards him, she defended herself saying she was just letting him know and he had no confidence and took it personally. I left but kept getting told to talk to him and get him to apologize for what he did.",

        "selftext": "My MIL has made a small family quilt for all of her kids and their spouses (5 couples including us). The quilt is really cute, has the couple's names, their kids' names, and their favorite hobbies and things all done in stitching and cute little cloth pictures. I was really looking forward to getting ours because I admit I'm a bit of a hipster and I love home-made kitschy stuff like that for our home. She recently finished her latest one for my husband's brother and I thought we were getting ours soon since my husband is the youngest. I asked my SIL (she got hers first) and she very awkwardly informed me that no such quilt will be coming our way. I was a bit upset and asked my husband to investigate. Turns out MIL has no intention of making a quilt for us because there's not enough to put on all the squares or whatever, basically meaning since we don't have kids we don't deserve a quilt because she can't be bothered. I message her directly about it because I'm just that kind of person. I like hearing it straight from the other guy. MIL says her fingers hurt after the first 4 quilts and she's taking a break. I ask her if it has anything to do with the fact that we have no kids (which she expressed negativity against in the past) and she says no even though I know it's a lie. I push her more and ask her when she thinks the quilt will be done after her little break and she kind of loses her temper and says there's no quilt and there never will be a quilt. I ask why and she says she's only interest in making quilts with her grandkids and things on them and we don't have enough hobbies and kids' hobbies to fill up a whole quilt. I tell her we have 2 beautiful dogs whom we love and could be put on there and she says I'm not making a whole quilt for a couple of goddamn dogs verbatim. I hang up and tell my husband and he's 100% on my side. But now I got a really mean voice message from my SIL telling me that I crossed the line and am acting like a huge B*tch for no reason. I'm shocked because I have a great relationship with my SIL and she always defended me from other family bullshit. My husband wants no part in this now. AITA for what I said to my MIL?",

I have been dating an American girl (F24) for two years now. My girlfriend does not speak French at all. The actual events in question happened this winter. I usually go to France around Christmas time. The most recent Christmas, my girlfriend wanted to come with me. I said sure as she had never been to France before and we'd been dating almost two years so it seemed reasonable.  My family comes from the South West, but I also have family in Paris so we stopped in Paris first. My gf wanted to eat at a fancy French restaurant while we were there, something with Michelin stars. Expensive, but not really a problem since I make pretty good money. We made a reservation for a good restaurant, not the best but still good. We had to make it months in advance because it's a restaurant that's high in demand. As a very upscale restaurant, there was also a dress code and things like that. We showed up and everything was fine at first. They took our coats, we sat down, the restaurant was beautiful, etc. The waiter then gave us our menu. I had to do all the communication as my gf doesn't speak French. I was showing my gf something on my menu and she noticed that mine had prices and hers didn't. I had completely forgotten about this tradition because it's just not common at all in the US. She asked me why mine had prices but not hers. I explained to her that it was just a tradition in many upscale French restaurants. She called it sexist and said it was ridiculous. I told her that it's just the way it is in these kinds of places, and that we shouldn't have come here if she was upset by this. She wanted me to ask for a menu with prices for her. I refused because we already had the prices and I didn't want to make a scene. She demanded that I confront a waiter about it or she would walk out. I called her bluff and she ended up staying, but didn't talk to me for the whole meal, which was delicious by the way. We've been back home for several months but she keeps bringing it up. I'm honestly considering ending the relationship over this because she will not stop talking about. She keeps accusing me of being sexist (I'm not) and has been making ridiculous comparisons. AITA?",

        "selftext": "AITA For unpacking my girlfriend\u2019s towel.  I (31M) and my gf (25F) have been dating for about 2 years.  My GF has beautiful hair that seems a lot more low maintenance than most women I know. She doesn\u2019t use all a hundred different hair products, nor does she blow dry it. It honestly doesn\u2019t take her long to style her hair or anything. However, she always insist on using this special towel to dry her hair.  She insists that she can\u2019t use any regular towel for her hair. She gets mad if I use her hair towel as a regular towel too. She says that the towel should only be used for hair. She even bought an extra one of these towels that she keeps in her drawer at my place. She also takes the towel with her when she goes on vacation.  I usually don\u2019t mind it, since the towel doesn\u2019t take up much space, and it better than listening to a hair dryer all the time. But it\u2019s a bit weird because I don\u2019t know anyone else who has a towel just for their hair.  For Thanksgiving, we travelled to see my family. Before the trip, I asked my GF to leave her towel at home since we\u2019ll be staying at my parents\u2019 house. I didn\u2019t want my family to think she was weird or make fun of her.  Since we planned to leave early in the morning, GF spent the night at my place. I noticed that she packed the towel she kept at my place in her suitcase. When she was asleep, I took the towel out. She didn\u2019t notice the towel was gone until after we got to my parent\u2019s house.  I thought it was okay, and my GF didn\u2019t seem mad at all during the whole trip. However, when we got back at my place, my GF got into her car and drove off without saying goodbye. She texted me later saying she\u2019s mad at me because of that stupid towel and she needs some space. I keep calling and texting her, but she won\u2019t respond.  My friends think she\u2019s being overly dramatic, but my GF isn\u2019t that type of person. Now I\u2019m wondering if I messed up. AITA",

        "selftext": "I know how the title sounds, hear me out. My [26M] gf [24F] takes forever in the bathroom. Upwards of 1 hour, sometimes closer to 2. When I playfully ribbed her about this, she'd get irritated but nothing major. 3 months ago I was playfully teasing her and she flipped out. She said she won't do anything anymore, and true to her word she hasn't shaved, waxed, or put on makeup since then, and wears her hair looking like bedhead. I told her that I got her point and would appreciate it if she resumed doing things that I also do to stay presentable. Her head hair improved a bit (although not even close to how it was before) but she still has hair on her legs and underarms, semi-unibrow etc. Now she's saying I have to pay her to resume taking care of herself, which I find crazy as I'm not her sugar daddy. Why should I pay for her to upkeep herself like she's my sugar baby? I understand that it's her body, her choice etc., but if there are any guys out there who think they would be ok if their gf had long underarm hair then you're a better man than me. I haven't pushed her to do anything, nor am I enforcing any ultimatums. If, as she says, I've been conditioned to want her to look a certain way... well, that sucks, but it's not my fault. If we broke up, she'd pay for all of this beauty stuff herself, so why should I pay? Anyone who says I'm TA, are you going to then start paying for all your girlfriends' beauty regimens, or else be fine with 100% body hair and no makeup or hair care ever? Be honest with yourselves. **Gf's side:** He keeps being a dick about how long I would take in the bathroom, so as he said, I quit things he didn't even realize I was doing. No makeup, no shaving/waxing, no brows, no waxing those moustache hairs, I have curly frizzy hair so I stopped using product or straightening/curling with an iron, no mani/pedi, no touching up or redoing my highlights. Do I look like a beast? Sure. Am I a comfy, smug beast? Hell yes. He rightfully pointed out that he takes care of himself for me (by shaving his beard and cutting his hair), so I obligingly waxed my upper lip and got a haircut. I'm continuing to do this whole thing because 1) it's so much less effort for me, 2) it's way cheaper, and 3) now that I stopped, I feel like... why do I ever have to do all this shit. It's unfair. And if I have to do it because both of us have been conditioned to see me doing these things as the basic standards for a woman, then he should pay half the costs. I conservatively spend at least $1k a year on brows, shaving supplies, hair products, highlights, haircuts, and makeup. Conservatively. He should have to pay me at least half if he wants me to do it, and extra for painful things like bikini waxes if he wants me to do them again. Otherwise it's not fair. **Both:** We love each other a lot and aren't actually fighting. We recognized that we're having a difference in opinion, and since neither has been able to sway the other we came to the court of public opinion. **EDIT (from bf):** alright, I'm the asshole. You know, it wasn't even the people saying I *was* the asshole that convinced me so much as the people saying I wasn't. No way in hell do I want to hold the same opinion as some of you, so if you think I'm not TA then I definitely am. My girlfriend not wanting to *remove body hair* is not the same as me walking around without showering, in stained shirts and greasy hair. Jesus. The amount of sexist pigs that personally reached out to assure me that I'm not TA and the Reddit commenters are comprised of libtards, cucks, feminazis, etc... man. I think it's reasonable to say that I'm allowed to no longer be attracted to her physically after this, and in that case I would either pay up or we break up. However, luckily, I am still very much into her. I would *highly prefer* the lack of body hair, but it's far from a dealbreaker and I think those who pointed out that I should be trying to unlearn these standards are correct. As I said before, this was never a fight. And for all of you calling my gf a fugly whatever and telling me I can do much better, she's always hot as fuck, have fun in your mom's basement tonight. **EDIT 2 (from gf):** Thank you, Reddit, for knocking some sense into this mans. He let me shave his legs. He said he feels like a dolphin. I've decided his genuine contrition and heartfelt apologizing is enough for me and will resume shaving my pits for him, and doing my brows and hair (I didn't spend years subscribed to r/curly only to let my hair turn into a shitshow now)",

When I go out I wear a silicon padding on my left breast otherwise it looks very odd and makes me self conscious.  My boyfriend (23M) and I have been in a long distance relationship for the past 3 years. We had met a couple of times but we just enjoyed each other's company. He knows i am a cancer survivor but doesn't know about my breast. I decided to move in with him about a month ago and we tried to have sex.  I said tried because the moment he laid eyes on my breast his face went white and he refused to touch me further. He said I had cheated him and that I should have told him earlier about my breast. I told him that I didn't think it was important since he said he loves all of me and that he thought I was beautiful. I am honestly so conflicted right now and I feel like a horrible person. AITA for not telling my boyfriend that I don't have breast? Edit: Had a talk with him. He says he can't be with me anymore, he didn't know I was lacking a breast because I looked fine in my pictures.

        "selftext": "Lots and lots of ugly background here but I'll try not to wander. My wife I have been separated for 2 years, ink to paper on an ugly and contentious divorce in May. I have primary custody of our two kids (daughter 17 and son 14) and live in the home which we've owned for 20 years.  On Monday I came home to find my son and two of his friends up on the roof to our little sun deck. I asked him what he was doing and if he was being safe. They said they were playing army and since I've coached the other two kids in mountain biking for almost 6 years now, I knew their parents wouldn't mind either. So I told him to put the ladder away when he was done and to keep his phone on in case I needed him to come down. I was actually most perturbed because he didn't put the ladder away. So they did this every day this week until Thursday when my daughter came home from her CIT job and in her every so sweet and acerbic tone asked me if I was really so stupid to think my son and friends were playing Army and let me know that the real reason is that our 22 year old neighbor was in her back yard topless and Aiden had set up a perch on the sun deck to get a better view. I climbed up thinking that she was just trying to get him in trouble but sure enough, the deck had  perfect view of the chaise lounge where I assume the girl had usually sat. I told my son to knock it off and he said he would.  This morning I got an angry knock on the door and it was my ex wife and the neighbor (they have been friends for many years) apparently the neighbor called my wife sometime mid week and they had agreed they would confront me and my son Saturday morning. We sat down and it went from a calm this is something we're concerned about to accusations of me being an irresponsible absentee parent and my son leading an adolescent sex ring in a matter of seconds. I tried to remain calm and explain that they are just acting like 14 year old boys and I've gotten them to stop. My wife asked if I planned on punishing him, I said that I don't feel like he did anything punishment worthy and rather this was a learning experience about respecting peoples privacy. My neighbor said that if he were her son he'd be in intensive psycho therapy and medicated. I told her that was really overkill. My wife told me not to talk to her friend like that and I asked them to leave before it got any more nuts. My wife has texted me that I am being incredibly irresponsible and if I don't do something she's going to her lawyer to revisit the custody arrangement. In all of that she called me an asshole several times and said it was more miserable being divorced from me than it was to be married to me. yay weekend!  I guess that's about it...but am I the asshole for how I'm handling the issue with my son?",

        "selftext": "My wife went into labor around 6 pm on Sunday. We were expecting twins. It quickly turns into a very painful process she kept cutting off the blood pressure to my hand when she squeezed and nearly sprayed my shirt with vomit. Around 3 am my dad calls. I work for my dad\u2019s company and we had a presentation for clients Monday morning that I had to get ready for. My dad heard my wife was in labor but told me he needed me on this presentation. He said there was nothing I could do to help my wife and delivery and seeing the baby come out was overrated and people don\u2019t prepare your for the gore. He said he needed me to rest up and make myself presentable for the presentation. My wife\u2019s labor was progressing very slowly and we were all certain she would need forceps or other assistance to deliver the babies.  I realized that I couldn\u2019t help her here, and my dad was counting on me, so I told her I needed to leave. She started screaming at me so loudly that a few nurses rushed over to our room. I ended up doing the presentation with the clients and things went well. I leave the office and see a text on my phone that said my wife delivered an hour ago at around 10:30 am and they had to use forceps.  I would have missed the meeting had I stayed and my dad has given me everything he could possibly give me in life, so I didn\u2019t want to let him down.  AITA?

My girlfriend (34F) is a preschool teacher and for some reason I can\u2019t explain she dresses like Ms. Frizzle. Like a dress with the pattern of whatever they are studying. She makes a lot of them herself, now including matching masks. The kids love it, and the parents seem to think it\u2019s great. I don\u2019t like the amount of attention she gets honestly. I\u2019d prefer if she came home and changed before running any errands. On Friday, she helped my mom with something after work and she was still in her weird dress. I have told her before I don\u2019t like when she dresses that way, but she tells me I don\u2019t have to like it, but I have no right to tell her how to dress. I was upset she went out like that with my mother, and told her that my mom said she was embarrassed and to ask that she please not dress like that again if they\u2019re going out. I was not expecting her to call my mom and apologize. When my mom asked what she meant, she told her what I said. My mom was furious, explained she doesn\u2019t have a problem with how my girlfriend dresses and thinks it\u2019s great she spends extra time doing things to engage her students. My mom then yelled at me for lying to my girlfriend and trying to throw her under the bus because I was being an insecure jerk. My girlfriend and I got into a huge fight. I said she should be embarrassed to be seen in public like that. She said the only thing she was embarrassed by was me. She hasn\u2019t spoken to me or done anything for me since. My friend said I was horrible and called me trash. I shouldn\u2019t have lied, but I think my girlfriend should take what I think about her clothes into consideration and I\u2019m not sorry for expecting her dress more appropriately in public. Am I really such an asshole here? EDIT: I\u2019m sure you all will be pleased to know we broke up tonight. She said I\u2019m to controlling and narrow minded so she broke up with me.  ",

She cares about her appearance, and I appreciate that. So this situation makes no sense to me. We were at a very fancy event with a few of my friends (social distancing rules, every one wore masks etc.) My girlfriend was wearing a beautiful white dress, which I recently bought for her. The dress was very expensive.\u00a0 We were all having a good time. However, at one point, she excused herself to go the bathroom, and then I didn't see her again until she sent me a text from the car asking if we could go home. Obviously I'm slightly annoyed because I didn't want to leave so soon. When I reached the car and asked why she wanted to go home, she told me that she got her period unexpectedly. I asked why she didn't bring extra tampons or pads (or use those tracking apps) she tried to defend herself by saying that she did everything she could, and that she had a period stain, and didn't want to stay because of the stain.\u00a0 She asked me to lie to my friends, and tell them that she was feeling\u00a0 unwell so that she could go home. She had a man's jacket (a mutual friend of ours) covering her legs (and the nasty stain) and pleaded with me to take her home so she could shower and unwind. I took her home and lied to my friends. When she was getting out of the car, the stain was very noticeable, it was very big and essentially ruined an expensive dress which I bought. She also made me purposefully lie because she wasn't prepared enough, and made me miss an event with my friends. Needless to say, I was extremely pissed.\u00a0 She said I was not being considerate and went to go lie down because she had a headache (she wanted to lie down after she took a shower) She woke up and I haven't spoken to her properly until she apologizes, and gives back the friends jacket. I don't think I'm an AH, but when I told my friend (the same friend who gave her a jacket) he told me that I was the AH, and my GF kind of agreed. AITA? EDIT: I guess I'm the AH. I logged out of this account about an hour after posting because the response was terrible, and then came back to a TON of responses calling me the AH. After my girlfriend came home from returning the jacket, she apologized for ruining the dress and I apologized for being a dumbas and not understanding the whole 'period' thing. She forgave me, then we went out for ice cream and rewatched her favorite movie. That's the end of the story.",

I was working in a bar to make money while I explored his city.  When I got pregnant he lost interest really quickly. I understood but I am pro choice. And I chose not to terminate.  I went home and had my son. I also made sure to get child support. He could afford it. He did fight it though. I had to prove paternity and everything.  Through that his parents found out. They are well off. They have met my son and they truly do seem to love him. They have provided gifts for his birthday and Christmas. They helped me with extra money so I could complete my university without going into debt. They have taken us on vacation with them so they could spend time with him. They aren't my biggest fans but we are cordial to each other.  Three months ago my son's father passed away. He got drunk at his bachelor party, tripped on the sidewalk, and hit his head. And that was all she wrote.  My son and I attended the funeral. We spent a week in that city so his grandparents could see him.  They approached me with an offer. They had no other children or grandchildren. Their son was only 28 so he had lots of time to provide them legitimate kids (they did not say this I'm just assuming) so they never thought about my son's name.  They said that if I changed his surname to theirs legally they would make him their primary heir. I think this is dumb. He is their only grandchild and they would deny him an inheritance because of his last name?  I said I would consider it, to be polite, and have left it at that. I actually have a pretty good life as it is. My family has been very supportive. And because of the whole court thing my son's father had to have life insurance with him as the beneficiary.  Would it be nice for my kid to get a big sum of money. Yes. Do I want him to have the surname of a man who didn't want him, see him, or love him? No.  I have been talking to my family about it and a few of them think I'm being an asshole for giving up.this kind of money for my son. It is generational wealth and I'm making the decision based on emotion. I think they are assholes for thinking money is the only thing that matters.  I think I will tell my son's grandparents that they can talk to him about it when he is 16. He will be old enough to understand the implications but young enough not to be tied professionally to his last name.",

        "selftext": "My ex husband and I share custody of our 10 year old daughter and 12 year old son. We have a 2-2-3 schedule which usually looks like I have the kids Friday after school and then he gets them Monday after school. I get them back Wednesday after school and then he gets them Friday after school and then the week flip flops. We've done this since our divorce 5 years ago and it works well. I'm a nurse in the OR so I schedule my shifts for the days during the week when they are with their dad and my one call weekend every 6 weeks is a weekend they are with their dad.  Recently, the kids said they want to try splitting up on the weekends, so instead of both of them being with one us during the weekend, one will go with dad and one will be with me. My son said he would make sure he was with me on call weekends because he can stay by himself if I have to get called in or can hang out at the hospital until I'm done. My ex is on board with this because he says it will allow us to spend one on one time with the kids and will allow the kids a break from each other (they squabble occasionally and annoy one another). While they have a point- sometimes it is hard to not feel like you are disappointing one by trying to accommodate the other, I do not want to give up my free weekends. It took me a few months to get used to not having my kids all the time after the divorce but now my weekends without them are filled with activities or travel. My ex agreed if there was a weekend trip I wanted to take he would be fine having both the kids that weekend but I honestly don't want to have to take his schedule into consideration when planning my trips, and sometimes they are spontaneous trips.  I was talking to my family about this at breakfast this morning and they are all kind of appalled by me not wanting to do this. My sister pointed out that if I was still married, then I wouldn't have all the child free time I have now and many mothers don't get a break from their kids like I do. My mom said she can't believe I'd deny my children quality time with their parents for selfish reasons like not wanting to give up my weekends. My SIL seemed to understand where I was coming from but said that she would still do it and just incorporate the child into whatever I was doing and pointed out my daughter would love to go on the NYC shopping trip I had planned for December and my son would happily join me for my Saturday morning spin classes. I considered that but my SIL loves taking her kids everywhere so I don't know that she is aware of how nice it is to just be an adult without the responsibility of a child wherever you go. They were really making me feel like an asshole though. AITA?",

        "selftext": "Throwaway account.  We were at a local restaurant last Saturday evening. This is a locally owned establishment, not a chain. There was a 30-45 minute wait for tables.  There was another family waiting in the wait area, and the mom went to the bar and came back with three drinks. A beer for dad and a margarita for her and one of the young women. There was another young woman there who looked of college age, and had on a college sorority t-shirt, but no drink was brought for her. But as I watched I noticed that the mom was sharing her margarita with the 4th girl, who I assumed was under 21 as she had no drink of her own. In fact, I'd guess the 4th girl consumed MOST of the mom's margarita. I mentioned this to my husband and he said so what, forget it. Full disclosure that I'm a non drinker myself and certainly don't approve of underage drinking, not to mention that this behavior might put the restaurant at risk. So I mentioned it to the hostess. A short time later a manager (I assume) came and asked to see the girls' ID's. The girl with her own drink produced one. The second girl who had been drinking from Mom's drink did not.  I did not hear the exchange, but the family left thereafter. I assume they were asked to do so.  My husband said that it was a crappy thing for me to do. I feel like I was protecting the restaurant. Was I the Asshole?",

I said that I wasn't sure what she expected to happen getting a group of people drunk, using illicit substances, and getting horned up watching exotic dancers.

I get why she didn't want to help me look for the dog but I can't get over the lack of empathy and bordering selfish behavior of this either.  My dog (6yo Heeler/Corgi mix) runs off at least once a week. Usually my fiance will help me find her but it's not without protest. I honestly didn't even know how she was getting out of our fenced yard so I installed cameras and found that she was scaling the 8ft fence. I ended up attaching spinners to the top of the fence thinking that would solve the issue but it didn't. I brought her out today and was playing with her when my phone rang. I was inside just long enough to grab my phone and my dog had gotten out.  I immediately went in search for her, thinking she couldn't have gotten far but I couldn't find her anywhere so I went back to the house and asked my fiance, who was curled up on the sofa, to come help me. She immediately said no. She said she was tired of chasing the dog, that she isn't dealing with it anymore and that I should have been out there watching her. I explained to her that I had been watching her and simply stepped away for point two seconds to grab my phone just inside the sliding door and she had escaped. She again said it wasn't her problem and she's not exhausting herself anymore to search for my dog. I won't even say it was unexpected because as I said, in the past she has always had a problem with helping me search but she's never said no. She just complained about it.  At first I went and searched myself. After maybe a half hour I came back and asked her again to come help me and she snapped I said no! I am so tired of chasing that dog around multiple times a week when I'm already exhausted and throwing up constantly. I was panicked and unleashed some yelling, which involved me telling her she was a bitch who lacked empathy and that I was thoroughly disappointed with my decision to be with someone so heartless. It was out of pure fear and panic on my part and I did apologize later, after I found my dog, but she said Go fuck yourself and won't talk to me. AITA? Everyone is on my side except my sister, who says I'm a fucking prick because it's not my pregnant fiance's responsibility to chase around your fucking mutt and said she would have left immediately if her BF ever said what I did to her.",

But can be civil enough to sit at the same table. So, we went and had dinner and talked and everything was going well, no argument nothing til after my wife went to use the bathroom. Later my brother went to use the bathroom then came back looking pissed. He kept giving me and my wife looks but I didn't know what was going on til he pulled me aside before we left and told me that my wife had left her used pad in his bathroom. I was shocked and didn't know what to say because this felt highly inappropriate. He said he didn't appreciate what my wife did and that it was a sign of disrespect towards him. I apologized profoundly and said I didn't know about it. He asked me to speak to her or she wouldn't be welcome in his place anymore. We got in the car and I asked my wife about it, she nonchantly said there was nothing wrong with what she did and that my brother was being ridiculous. I kind of flipped and told her it was very inappropriate for her to leave her used pad in his place even if it was in the bathroom and in the trashcan because it made him uncomfortable. She yelled asking what she was supoosed to do and I told her she could've took it with her and threw it outside not in his bathroom -- that's my brother's place and he told me how he felt about it. She yelled at me calling my brother an incel and me an asshole for getting in her face about it. She said she needed to use the bathroom and it's not like the pad was vidible since she dumped it in the trashcan. At home we still argued about it and she kept on calling me and my brother names. She's currently not speaking to me and is avoiding me entirely. Regardless, I feel like it's his place and he gets to express what makes him uncomfortable in it. EDIT. I can't give info or expand on what was seen but I can tell you that the trash can does not have a lid. It's not like one of those trashcans that have a lid on top and you can push it. What I want to emphasize on is the fact that as guests we should respect people's homes and not argue about what makes them uncomfortable. He said it made him uncomfortable and that should, in my opinion, be acknowledged.",

There are no allergies. My family and I often make two versions of dinner - one meat, one real, and twice the amount of pots and pans. There is an equal distribution of cleaning and cooking in this house, thankfully. My daughters had a fun prank idea of making two pots of spaghetti sauce, under the pretense that one was meat (they were both the soy ground beef). The goal here was to see if their brother and father actually hated the meat and to see if we could maybe save some dishes and time (in the future). Everyone loved dinner, both husband and son finished their plates. This was when my youngest couldn't hold it in anymore and told them.

        "selftext": "My son has been seeing this lovely girl for about 4 months.  They are both 16.  Her parents have a litany of issues (super controlling, narcissistic mom and alcoholic dad.)  Generally, because she lives much closer to the school, my son goes over there occasionally after school, and I pick him up in the evening.  I will also drive him there sometimes on weekends and pick him up when he's ready. The mom has all sorts of odd rules for my son when he's there, which is fine.  It's her house.  Most of the rules seem to be based around her daughter's chastity.  He is allowed in her room, but not on the bed.  Then, weeks later, he is allowed on the bed, but not under the covers .WTF?  And she will check on them quite regularly, making sure they are being 'proper'.  (not under the covers, the door open etc.)  They also want him out before a certain time (which changes depending on ... ? )  Sometimes it's 7:30, sometimes it's 9:30.  Whatever. Regardless, she usually doesn't come to our house, because her parents are so controlling.   Well, today she came over for the first time.   The night before, her mom called and wanted to talk to me.  I am a correctional officer and was working that night, so I wasn't home to take the call.  My son offers to let her to talk to my husband, who was home, but she only wanted to talk to me.   Later on, her dad calls, and he talks to my husband.   I don't have the details of the conversation, but basically, he wanted to make sure that there would be at least one parent home at all times and that we would keep an eye on them at all times.  My husband agreed. Thing is, we don't really care.  I was sexually active at a younger age than them.  My son and I have had lots of talks about consent and not being sexually pushy with people and respect and birth control, etc.  He is a lovely boy, and I believe he would never push her to do anything she wasn't comfortable with.  They have been sexually active with each other already.  (teens will find a way!)  Anyway, not only did I not check on them constantly, I told him that as long as she was willing, I would give them as much privacy as they wanted, providing they were using protection.  My husband and I actually had to go out for a couple of hours, and I asked a good friend who lives just down the street if she would 'cover' for me, if this girl's parents called or showed up and pretend to be my cousin.  (parents did not have our exact address yet, so we would have had a warning about them showing up.)  Good friend laughed and agreed.   Turns out it wasn't needed.   Dad eventually came and picked her up. I absolutely stand by my opinion that MY son can have privacy and agency over his own body at this age, but I am kind of wondering if I should have made that choice for someone else's child.  I kind of feel guilty, but I think her parents are WAY over the top control freaks. AITA?",

        "selftext": "(Throwaway because some of my family use Reddit.) Hi, all. I (F30) have been dealing with chronic medical issues all my life. I married my (33) husband, L, a few years ago and had my daughter A (5) soon after. When I was pregnant with A, I was warned that it would be difficult due to my issues and that she would likely have some passed on from me. I accepted this, and I expected it. She was delivered and was a beautiful baby girl who didn't have my issues at the time. However, as she got older, it became more apparent that she inherited my medical problems. One of which has an optional surgery that could negate it entirely. It's possible to live with it instead of choosing to operate, but the surgery will eliminate it. I have some trauma with hospitals in general. I've had to be in and out of them my entire life, and it's left some deep wounds. It's awful to spend your formative years stuck in a sterile room with an IV and in pain. I've spent some time in therapy for it, but I still hate them. The surgery that would remove the problem is covered by insurance, so money isn't a problem. However, it has a long recovery period, and I don't want my daughter to have to suffer through that. I've told L that I don't want her to have to go through the lengthy process of recovery. He disagrees and has asked my family members to knock some sense into me. (His words, not mine.) It's become a big point of contention between us, and I refuse to budge. So, AITA? Edit: For those who want to know, she has radioulnar synostosis in both arms. She'd have to spend weeks in casts with both arms. Edit 2: You are right. I was letting my own fear cloud my judgement. Thank you. Although, a bit rude to say that I should get sterilized, no? Edit 3: While I understand that I was undoubtedly TA here, it's disgusting how many people have written horrible comments, sent messages, and just been total jerks. You do not know me. I don't know you. This is ONE moment in my and your life, and I sincerely don't understand why you have to be so nasty about it. No, I will not sterilize myself. I will not kill myself, give up my child, or divorce my husband. I will not categorize myself as an abusive narcissistic sadist who hates my child and wants her to suffer like I have. I don't appreciate being psychoanalyzed by armchair psychiatrist Redditors.  To those who have respectfully put down their points, sent me kind messages, or just been supportive. I appreciate you all.",

My husband and I are looking to upgrade homes given we're planning on expanding our family, so we've been looking at a few open houses recently. About a week ago we were at an open house when our daughter (4) wandered off and picked up this mask type thing laying out on a table. Super bright, very loud, apparently VERY fragile and pretty much right out in the open. When I saw her touching it I told her to put it down but it was too late and somehow it had gotten cracked down the middle. Now, I'm not sure if it was already broken and they had left it out as some sort of trap (because who leaves something bright like that lying around during an open house, with children walking around?), or if she did anything, but I felt extremely embarrassed and grabbed my daughter and told my husband it was time to leave. A so called friend of mine who knows the house owner saw me there and apparently told her she saw me rushing out of her house on the same day she returned to find the mask broken. Now she's hitting me up on the phone demanding I pay her back for breaking art and naming an absolutely ludicrous price (think four figures). I'm absolutely not going to pay her that, but a few people I know think I'm in the wrong here. I personally think if you're having an open house that children will be visiting you don't leave expensive breakables out in the open. I also do not believe for a second that thing was worth thousands of dollars, and if it was, I think there's a very good chance she broke it herself then left it lying around to pin it on someone else and guilt some money out of them.

        "selftext": "My (25M) GF (24) had a double mastectomy 5 years ago; she had breast cancer, and thankfully made a full recovery. Unlike a lot of women, she didn't have any reconstructive surgery. This was before I met her.  I'm a big anime nerd, and last weekend I invited her to a small anime con with me. She's seen a few episodes of my favorite shows, but she's not into anime; she does like cosplay, though, and she works seasonally as an SFX artist at a haunted house near us. So when I asked her to go to the con with me, she asked if she could cosplay, and I said sure. She got very excited and said I was going to love her costume, so I'll admit I thought she was going to do something sexy for me. Well, not exactly. The day of the convention comes, and she showed up at my house cosplaying Dabi from MHA- specifically a look he has later in the manga. It's a long white coat over white pants, no shirt. Her entire chest was exposed and she'd obviously spent hours applying burn makeup; she has short hair that she dyes constantly, this time she bleached it white and dyed a few red streaks.  I wasn't expecting her to show up without a shirt. Her burn scar makeup only covered half her chest, so you could clearly see her mastectomy scar. It wasn't a verry attractive costume, especially since she'd gone all out with the scars and made them look raised and kind of realistic.  We went to the con, and while a lot of people came up to take photos with her, I noticed several others looking at her chest. That evening, she said I'd been quiet all day, and I honestly told her I was a little embarrassed that she was flaunting her mastectomy scar like that. She got mad and said she was making the best of her situation and said I was being insensitive, and she's been distant ever since. I'm starting to feel guilty. AITA?",

My exhusband has her for certain days, and his birthday didn't fall on one of these days. In fact, it fell on one of the days where my daughter is supposed to be with me. He called me so we could discuss letting him have my daughter on the day of his birthday but I told him no because it is not his day to have her, he got my daughter involved and she said she really wants to go but I said no because I have my reasons. My exhusband dropped it but on the day of his birthday, I went to pick my daughter up from school but I discovered that he came and took straight to the restaurant where his birthday party was taking place. I was fuming I called him but he didn't pick up, I then called my daughter and she said she was with him. I used location feature to track her phone and got the address. I showed up and interrupted the party, My exhusband started arguing with me but I told he had no consent to have my daughter with him that day but he said my daughter wanted to be there for his birthday. My former MIL tried to speak to me and I told her to stay out of it then told my daughter to grab her stuff cause we were going home. My exhusband and family unloaded on me and I tried to ignore them and just leave but my daughter made it hard for me. I took her home eventually and grounded her for agreeing to leavd school with her dad when it wasn't his day. Her dad called me yelling about how bitter and spiteful I was to deprive my daughter from attending his birthday, I told him it's basic respect and boundaries but he claimed it was just me being spiteful and deliberately hurtful towards him that I didn't even care how it affected my daughter. I hung up but more of his family members started blasting me on social media saying I showed up and made a scene at the restaurant. Went as far as calling me 'unstable'.",

This concerns my oldest, I'll refer to her as 'Zara' We don't normally do big parties in our family after double digits (and 18th/21st), but Zara has been going through a bit of a difficult time so we decided to throw her a surprise party. This was yesterday. It was a big family party and Zara was enjoying it. Then the cake was brought out, I have a lot of young nieces and nephews so naturally they wanted to stand up with Zara, and she had no issue. When she went to blow out the candles, my 5 year old niece blew most of them out before her. Everyone laughed it off, my youngest actually put 23 candles on the cake and there were still a few lit, so I told Zara to blow those out. She did, but she looked angry and started crying. She then walked off. After that it got quite awkward and my sister (niece's mom) got upset/embarrassed, that her daughter is a kid and didn't mean to do it, and she didn't think Zara would act like this. We all calmed her down that it's not their fault. I talked to Zara and told her she was being a selfish brat and making a scene, she's 23 getting mad about birthday candles. She was still upset, and my other kids are telling me I wasn't being fair with Zara.",

        "selftext": "This is literally really stupid but she's really upset about it. So my (48) daughter (23) has a blue tongue skink who she heavily adores. She jokingly refers to it as her daughter, I've found it weird but she says it's because it's the closest thing she'd have to a child and she feels a strong emotional bond similar to a child. She has decided to remain child free for multiple reasons and I have been very supportive of this decision. Well she recently took her Skink to the vet for a checkup and she was excited to find out her Skinks gender. Afterwards I got a text asking if I'd come to her gender reveal party she was having. She explained it was just a small get together with cake and food for her friends she hasn't seen in a while with the gender reveal being mostly a joke (and a way to make fun of real gender reveals). Well I didn't come. I didn't see a point. It's just a lizard and I'm a busy person. She later called me and expressed she was kind of sad I didn't come cuz it'd been a while since I'd seen her but she understood I was busy. I told her she couldn't actually expect me to come to a gender reveal for a lizard. She said that it wasn't a real gender reveal, that was more of a joke and it was really just a small gathering to catch up with everyone. I told her if that was the case she should've just called it a gathering because I'm not coming to a gender reveal unless it's for a real grand daughter. She got quiet for a minute and then turned my words around, claiming I wasn't supportive of her decision to be childfree. I told her she can't possibly expect me to treat a lizard as a grand daughter, she said she didn't expect me too but it was clear I didn't respect her bond with her lizard and her decision, and she just wanted to see me and my reason for coming was hurtful. I told her she was being ridiculous over a lizard, she claimed it wasn't over the lizard and it was a gathering and not even centered around the lizard, but I stick by to what I said. It's ridiculous to have a gender reveal for a lizard. She hung up and I got a message from her best friend about how I'm an asshole for treating her that way, but I don't think I'm the asshole for not wanting to go to a party for a lizard?   EDIT: In the time I was away I got many replies and it was a lot to read through. Let me clear a couple things up. 1. My issue is that she said the party was a gender reveal, if she had called it just a party I would have come. But calling it a gender reveal makes it sound like it's for the lizard, and I'm not going to that even if it is a joke. 2. I don't know why it matters but the Skink is a girl which is why I said I'm not coming to a gender reveal unless it's for a real grand daughter. 3. Even though I don't agree with my daughter for being childfree, I have been supportive and only shown mild frustration. The reasons she decided to be childfree is she claims she's asexual, she just doesn't want one, she has emotional baggage and feels unable to care for a real child, she fears pregnancy, and she has a carrier gene like me and doesn't want to go through what I did (I had 4 miscarriages and a highly defect child that died after 3 months due to the gene). Yes there has been slight tension between us because I think she just hasn't found the right man (she never dated growing up) and her other fears are unnecessarily exaggerated, but it's ultimately her decision and I don't resent her.4. We haven't seen each other in three months. I'm a single mother and we have always been close which is why she invited me with her friends, I just didn't want to go to a party with a lizard, and if it wasn't for the lizard she should've called it a party instead of a gender reveal.",

She only remained in contact with Mike since everybody else judged her for going no contact. She's getting married to her fiance of 3 years.

She asked Mike if he could walk her down the aisle and he agreed. I have to say that I was taken aback and it felt a bit odd for me because, her dad is alive, they're on speaking terms again, he's gonna be there at the wedding so the logical thing to do is have him walk her down the aisle. This role isn't for her older brother but her father. Not to mention how FIL will feel about it. I brought this up with Beth and she had an attitude and implied that I was just saying this and objecting because of how I feel about the situation not how our traditions should be practiced. We got into an argument and I went home. Mike thinks I'm being unreasonable and possibly causing him to miss something so sentimental and that if anything, he feels honored to be asked to do this for her, and said that I should stop worrying about what others might say.

I have a crush on her although she isn't exactly my type. Lately I feel like I've been getting vibes that she likes me back. Last week I won a raffle and have 2 tickets to see a famous singer perform next month in a nearby city. She also happens to like this singer so I asked her if she wanted to go with me as a date. I said I can book us a hotel room and we can spend the night together. She said she'd love to go, but only as friends. She says she's alright with us splitting a hotel room as long as it has two beds. She told me she doesn't feel ready to date anyone at the moment, and she doesn't do flings either, so unfortunately we can only be platonic friends. I said I'll think about it. I was quite hurt because honestly I don't have much experience with rejection, and I was annoyed that she turned me down.  Today, i asked my female coworker to go with me to the concert as a date. She immediately said yes and seemed quite excited about it although she admitted that she never listened to any of their songs. Still, I'm taking her out for drinks on Friday. But just now, the friend who I asked originally asked if we were still on for the concert. I told her honestly that I already asked another woman, and she seemed disappointed but dropped the subject. When I told my sister about what happened, she said I'm being really douchy. She says her friend is a huge fan of the singer and I should take her instead of my coworker who doesn't even like the band but only wants to go because she likes me. I said she can't understand because she's not a dude. Because let's me honest, if I had the choice between going out with a girl who only wants to be my friend versus a girl who is super into me and wants to take things to the next level, then obviously I'm taking the second one. AITA for just being honest about what I want? **EDIT**: Because a lot of the hang up is over the hotel room thing: YES I would have been fine if the first girl agreed to go with me as a date, but wanted separate hotel beds/rooms. Nowhere do I even say that we have to share a bed... But the part where she says she\u2019s not ready to date anyone essentially means she is not interested in me. She likely said she\u2019ll go with me as friends just to be nice and not hurt my feelings. So why would I make the experience awkward for the both of us when I could bring along someone who actually is interested in dating me? **EDIT OVER**",

Over that time my friends circle got considerably smaller but my best friend remained, Mia (f31). Mia doesn\u2019t have kids nor wants kids but she\u2019s been brilliant with Ciara. I\u2019m a SAHM and obviously don\u2019t have as much time to hang out as I did previously. Mia and I live on the same street (we\u2019re in Manchester, England) and it\u2019s a walking distance between our houses. I\u2019ve told Mia numerous times that she can just pop in whenever she wants to (she works from home) but she rarely does.  She did at the beginning but it\u2019s been happening less and less. Instead, she keeps suggesting we go out for coffee or pizza or even a drink but I don\u2019t have the time and always just tell her to come over and we\u2019ll have coffee at my place. She asked if I wanted to go out with her and her other friends for a drink last weekend but I said that no but she\u2019s welcome to come over and we\u2019ll have a few drinks at mine. She said she already had plans and it felt weird to drink when she knows there\u2019s a child around.  Honestly, I feel neglected. I feel like she put me on a back burner and doesn\u2019t want to be friends anymore. I\u2019m always available but she rarely comes over and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s fair. Today, I saw her photos from Saturday night out and I was fuming. She ditched me just so she could go and drink like she\u2019s 20 again. I felt rejected and horrible, I thought we were best friends but she clearly doesn\u2019t value me when she won\u2019t even have a few drinks with me at my house. When she finished work, she called and asked if I fancied going for coffee to town but I asked her to come over again. She said yes but before she disconnected, I heard her mumble \u201clike always.\u201d This really annoyed me. When she came over, I decided to be open about everything. And while not my proudest or most mature moment, I shouted at her that she\u2019s an awful friend m, that she barely comes over and if she doesn\u2019t want to spend time with me to just say it and stop playing around. She said she\u2019s always been accommodating but it\u2019s been 2 years and she doesn\u2019t want to spend time with me when there\u2019s always a kid, especially now when she has to watch her language (Mia likes to swear). I said that she knew I had a child and responsibilities. And she said that Tom (my partner) could take care of Ciara once in a while so I could have a time off. This felt really intrusive and I told her to mind her own business and not meddle on my marriage.  I was really angry with her and kicked her out. She called me a selfish asshole on her way out. Normally, I would expect her to call by now with apologies but she hasn\u2019t done so and I\u2019m starting to wonder was I the asshole or was she? Perhaps I was too harsh and should\u2019ve been more careful with discussing it.",

        "selftext": "My husband and I live in an upstairs 3 bedroom flat and the flat below us is the same lay out. The house has been for sale for awhile and recently a woman bought it. It turns out she doesn't have any children so I found it strange she bought a 3 bedroom house but I soon found out it's because she runs a craft business from home and needs 2 bedrooms to run it. The problem is unfortunately she has decided to use to main bedroom, which is below us as her main craft room.  At first it was fine as she hadn't fully moved in but now it's driving me crazy. She's in that room almost all day and I can hear her walking about and the faint noise of machines. I don't spend long in my bedroom during the day but when I do go in it just annoys me knowing she's there constantly. Like why can't she have picked the smaller bedrooms since she knows the kids are at school all day? She always stops using her embroidery and sewing machines by 7pm but she's told me she can sit up until 10pm some nights finishing off orders which plays on my mind. I go to bed at 9pm and I can't sleep for hours as I lie there listening for her every move. Just knowing she's awake and walking about drives me crazy as I find it so selfish someone would buy a flat and work from home.  My husband says he can barely hear a thing during the day and I need to calm down. He also doesn't see the big deal about her using her house as she pleases. Yesterday I finally had enough and went to her door. I told her how I was feeling about everything and how I can hear the faint noise of her machines. She apologized and invited me inside to show me her set up. All her machines are on some sort of anti vibration padding to stop as much noise as possible so she claims the noise should be minimal and that you need to expect some noise from neighbours. I told her I don't make any noise and that's when things took a turn as she said she can hear my kids running around and jumping off furniture all evening but she would never dream of complaining because it's just one of those things when you share a building with other people. I left before I said anything else I regretted and I thought that was the end of it but today my husband came home from working overnight and asked if I had said anything to the woman downstairs as she was very cold and blunt with him when he said hello. I told him what happened and he said I'm a massive asshole. I've spoken to a couple of my friends who think I've handled this completely wrong and I'm a bit of an asshole for it but I don't see what else I could have done",

        "selftext": "My son is a 20 month old toddler, my wife is a stay-at-home mom, I work six days a week and I'm usually gone for twelve hours a day. I always check in on my son remotely via our nursery cam app and he's always awake in the mornings around 8:00. He has a great sleep routine. Our wind down time starts at the same time every evening, we clean up toys, read a book, when I lay him down he's still awake, he falls asleep on his own and sleeps all night for at least twelve hours. It's usually after 9:00 before I have a chance to check the camera, this morning when I checked it was 9:12 and some mornings are closer to 10:00. Every time I look though, he's awake in the dark and standing in his crib just waiting. When I see this, I immediately turn on the brightest night light the camera has and speak to him through the camera app. I always tell him good morning and I love him and he usually laughs and says Dada. Then I leave the app and call my wife to wake her up. I usually have to call three to four times and when she finally answers, it's obvious that she just woke up and only because I called. I tell her that our son is awake waiting for her and that she needs to get up to start their day. This morning while on the phone, I asked her if she was going to get him after using the bathroom and she said no, she was going to the kitchen to prepare their breakfast and THEN she'd get him. I asked her to get him after the bathroom so he could go to the kitchen with her and she flipped out. She told me it pisses her off that I call EVERY morning to tell her how to be a mom and that she has a routine. I retorted with well, your routine sucks because he's been awake for an hour and you'd still be asleep if I hadn't called. I just bothers me that he has to wait so long. He needs a diaper change, he's probably thirsty, hungry and just wants to play. Am I wrong though? Do I need to stop? Please be completely honest with your answers. Thanks!  **EDIT #1**  I was banned from commenting within the first hour because I violated a rule in a comment and that's why I wasn't responding to anyone. I'm a fairly new Reddit user in terms of posting - I normally read a lot and that's all - and because of this, I had no clue that a temporary comment ban didn't affect my ability to edit the post. I would have edited the post much sooner had I known I was able to regardless of the comment ban. There are so many things that need to be addressed about this post and the most important one is about my wife. I love her more than anyone on Reddit thinks I do. She is an amazing woman and a wonderful mother. I absolutely DO NOT think she is an incompetent parent nor do I think she neglects my son. None of the information I provided was ever supposed to convey that negative message about her. My whole issue was: he's awake, he's been awake, why are you still asleep? - that's all, and she agreed she stays up too late plus has alarms set now. I showed my wife how this post EXPLODED and she COULD NOT believe the kind of attention it got. She is very much in love with me and does not agree that I am controlling nor does she believe that I am micromanaging her daily life. Also, because so many people believe that I intentionally left out the medical issues she has, I'll list them here: - postpartum depression- low vitamin B-12- chronic fatigue Now, let me explain why I didn't list them originally. Her low vitamin B-12 is not a deficiency, her level is just lower than what is considered best for her age; this is according to recent bloodwork that I recommended. The results state that any number between 100 pg/mL and 914 pg/mL is within normal range, and her level is 253 pg/mL. The doctor suggested sublingual B-12 1000mcg daily to raise the level a little, but stated that apart from that, she could not find a reason for the chronic fatigue. Because of these results, and especially after purchasing the supplements, in my mind, the B-12 is not a problem. Also, the bloodwork confirmed that everything else was normal. The postpartum depression is actively being monitored and treated by a professional. My wife literally goes to a psychiatrist, or psychologist (I can't remember their exact title) multiple times a year and we pay for medication every 30 days. She initially tried depression medication, followed the regimen religiously and not much changed for her. This was addressed in a following appointment and a new medication was prescribed. Her current medication is normally used to treat ADHD or narcolepsy and the doctor believed it would alleviate some of her tiredness and release more dopamine thus providing more energy in her daily life. This does seem to be true and she seems to be happy with the medicine. The chronic fatigue is a result of her own poor scheduling and personal health. She has agreed that she spends too much time sitting and using the phone. She naps when our son naps and has trouble falling asleep at a normal bedtime hour due to this daytime sleep. We always go to bed together and he's told me multiple times that she moved to the living room after I fell asleep because she couldn't sleep and was bored just lying there. Then, midnight or later comes, she's finally drowsy and decides to sleep. However, the overstimulation from social media and phone usage makes it difficult for her brain to reach REM sleep normally. So she falls asleep at 12:00, our son wakes up at 8:00, eight hours have passed and she still feels tired and not at all rested. I do know and have known about her condition. We have agreed to disagree about the cause of her sleeping problems. In her mind she has chronic fatigue because of insomnia and it's a vicious cycle. In my mind she stays up too late on the phone and doesn't get the sleep her body needs. Whether the internet thinks she is a bad mother, negligent, lazy or abusive is not important. I know and love the woman I married, I do feel comfortable leaving her with our kid and she does an amazing job with him. In a few comments I stated that she was lazy and didn't do much at home. I won't deny those statements, but in the moment I was still aggravated because the argument over the phone had just recently ended. I don't truly think she's lazy because I've seen what she can do; I just think she's unmotivated due to a lack of sleep and the same four walls every day. Finally, I am not spying on her or my son. We only have two cameras in this house and both are in our son's room. One camera provides a wide-angle view of the entire room and the other is positioned directly above his crib. The cameras serve no purpose during the day because I'd barely be able to hear background noise from another room even if I did try to listen in. My wife is an amazing woman and an amazing mother. My son is just so happy all the time, he's super smart, full of energy and extremely healthy. I will not be hiring a nanny or using a daycare. There is absolutely nothing wrong with what my wife does during the day, I just wish she'd start her day earlier for my little man. I want to say thank you to everyone who commented on this post and messaged me. My wife and I had a long, in-depth conversation last night after all of the attention this post received and I've shown her everything. There were tears, much more laughs and a lot of things to think about. I think the most important thing we learned is that so many people are quick to judge and that in itself is a very big problem.  **EDIT #2**  I need to make it clear that my wife does not have narcolepsy. She is not taking medicine for narcolepsy. I said that the medicine she takes now is USUALLY used to treat narcolepsy or ADHD. She also does not have ADHD. The second thing we learned is that people love to add details and change the story.",

        "selftext": "My (26F) sister Anna (24F) married my friend Lance (27M), he was the cool guy in our friend group, handsome, misterious, smart, quiet. I don't know how he ended up with my sister, she's the total opposite, loud, funny, outgoing. She's beautiful tho, really beautiful, and when they got together everyone said how good they looked. Anna seemed to be really in love with him ALL THE TIME, she used to say how dreamy he was, how good he treated her and how spoiled she felt, but Lance was always so stern and quiet, she would revolve around him at family gatherings but he wouldn't engage that much with everyone but me and her. I was surprised when he asked her to marry him.My sister never took the wifey role too serious, she had a non-traditional wedding and Lance when along with it, she made a bunch of rules that he agreed to and then they moved to his house. Anna banned house utensils from the wedding gift list, she doesn't work, didn't finish her studies and they don't plan on having kids. My sister is pretty much only into her looks (And I didn't think Lance cared for that before), she's always on Snapchat or Instagram, I thought that after getting married she would dress more appropriate since she used to use crop tops, blouses, dresses and shirts that showed her cleavage, short skirts or tight jean, but she says that Lance likes her just fine. Last week was my dad's birthday and we had a party, my sister and Lance came and she was wearing a pretty short floral dress, nonetheless most of the men were looking at her including my dad's friends, Lance was as stoic as always and my sister came to my mom and I and saying that she didn't know why he was so quiet since he's not like that (HE is like that wtf) so I told her that if she didn't dressed like that he might take her more seriously. She got sad and sat quietly the rest of the night and I didn't think much of that, but a few days ago Lance texted me and said that he would appreciate if I didn't comment on her wife's way of dressing again. ??? Did I miss something? IM NOT IN LOVE WITH HIM",

        "selftext": "My daughter and I were recently on vacation. We spent the day in an area that\u2019s known to have a lot of rich/famous people and towards the end of the day we saw one of my daughter\u2019s favorite celebrities (we\u2019ll call her A) walking out of a store.  My daughter ran to the store but when she got near A, she was stopped by A\u2019s security. They said that A\u2019s there with her daughter for her daughter\u2019s birthday and wants to focus on her daughter.  My daughter was very upset because she\u2019s been a fan of A for a very long time so she tried again for a picture but was turned away.  My daughter was crushed so later that night I made a post talking about my experience with A. How she wouldn\u2019t let anyone go near her and her daughter, the fact that her security was rude, and her not being willing to stop for a couple seconds for a picture. I understand it\u2019s her daughter\u2019s birthday but a 1 minute interaction with a fan isn\u2019t going to ruin her day and if it does, that girl needs to learn that the world doesn\u2019t revolve around her.  The post ended up getting a lot of attention and a lot of people actually said my daughter and I were being entitled for expecting A to interrupt her daughter\u2019s birthday for everyone that wants a picture.  My husband also saw the post and said he couldn\u2019t believe that I would bash her for trying to spend the day with her daughter. I\u2019m not trying to bash her for spending the day with her daughter but she wouldn\u2019t be where she is without her fans so I think she at least owes it to them to take a picture.

        "selftext": "Sis is 28 I'm 26M.  My sis N has always had a strained relationship with our parents especially my mom. I am clearly not privy to the reasons because things are fine with me and my parents. When N went to college she met her creative writing professor as a freshman and they got close immediately. They would do a lot together and worked closely on a few different writing projects. N never specifically said this, but it was obvious to anyone who saw them interact that they had a substitute mother/daughter type relationship. Which hurt my mom a lot to see. I always thought she'd grow out of it or that the prof would move on but ten years later they were still very close.  About a month ago the prof died unexpectedly and it devastated N. She was really dperessed over the holidays which of course was all in front of my mom and was a difficult reminder that N loved the prof as a mother way more than she ever loved my mom as a mother. She still talks to my parents and stuff and they don't fight or anything but N is very distant and doesn't tell them anything about her life beyond the bare minimum. My mom tried to comfort N but N was doing her distant thing and didn't want comfort.  Something unfortunate that happened to N is that when she got the call that she died, she was brewing tea and in the shock of the news she spilled boiling water on her arm which burned her kinda badly on her wrist. I think the burn was like on the borderline of 2nd and 3rd degree, and definitely still looked pretty rough during the holidays. N said it was especially hard because in addition to the physical pain, every time she looks at it she is reminded of the moment she found out the prof died. Which I totally get. I was on facetime with N and she said she talked to her tattoo artist friend who said that the burn should be able to heal well enough to get a tattoo over it. N then excitedly told me about her idea which is a type of flower that the prof gave her a bouquet of for her undergrad graduation. My mom was so embarrassed that day because she didn't get N flowers but the prof did and N was parading them around so happy and it was a reminder of their connection. I guess N and the prof exchanged these flowers for every special occasion like birthdays etc. So now she wants to get a decent sized tattoo in a highly visible spot of something that will remind everyone of the prof. I told N that this seemed really cruel to my mom who already feels cast aside and like she's in exile from N. And that's without the constant permanent reminder. N kind of scoffed and said I can't believe you think you have the right to tell me not to do this, called me an ass and hung up and is still not talking to me except for a very brief text saying congrats for a promotion I just got. My parents aren't commenting. My dad said I should have just kept quiet even though he agrees and my mom made no comment but seemed grateful I stood up for her. I feel like I was just being protective of my mom. But AITA?",

When I met my fianc\u00e9, he was at my house to supervise a roofing crew the insurance company hired to replace my damaged roof. I instantly fell for him when he pulled up in his truck and couldn\u2019t keep my eyes off of him for the rest of the day as he gave orders to his men. When we started dating, he was vague about his job and I just chalked it up to him being insecure about me having a better career. I didn\u2019t care about our income imbalance. When we got serious, we talked about our future plans and that was when he told me the full extent of his little construction company. I was shocked that his construction earnings is as much as my dad\u2019s surgeon salary. Gradually he took me around to the handful of construction lots and shopping centers he owns. His rental income combined with his construction earnings is double that of my dad\u2019s. He said that few people know about his finances and he expects me to keep what I know to myself. My parents disapproved of him since the 1st time I brought him home. My dad coined the term \u201ctool boy\u201d and the rest of my family joined in whenever they talk behind my fianc\u00e9\u2019s back. They don\u2019t call him that to his face but instead make snide remarks. Once my mom said during dinner that they\u2019re thinking about hiring someone to mow their lawn then turned to my fianc\u00e9 and asked him what he charges. I always try to defend him and it\u2019s a constant battle. It\u2019s gotten worse since we\u2019re planning our wedding and the other day my nerves just broke. Yesterday parents were trying to get me into getting a prenuptial then my dad said, \u201cyou have to protect your assets just in case tool boy decides to go slumming.\u201d I lost it and yelled at my parents. During our shouting, I blurted out his earnings and that he makes more than both of them combined then I stormed out. I told my fianc\u00e9 what happened but instead of supporting me, he got mad that I told his parents that. I argued that I was defending him then we got into an argument. My parents and family are mad at me for keeping secrets. My fianc\u00e9 is mad at me for not keeping secrets. I\u2019m stuck in the middle and don\u2019t know what to do.",

Yesterday, we were visiting my family because we won't be able to be with them on Christmas, so we wanted to drop off some presents. It was also the first time that my boyfriend met my entire family, so it was kinda important. Here's the thing, I forgot to tell them that my boyfriend is vegetarian, so my mom made a turkey and there wasn't really anything else to eat, beside some snacks. When I realized that, I quietly asked my boyfriend to please not cause a scene, and just eat the food and compliment my mom on it. He tried to argue back, saying that he doesn't wants to lie to my mom but I told him he would come across as rude if he didn't atleast tried it, and I didn't wanted him to make a bad impression. So he sucked it up, ate an entire plate and told my mom that it was delicious, which obviously made her happy. We had a good evening and everyone seemed to like him, but when we drove back home he brought it up again and said he thinks it was kinda fucked up of me to expect him to eat meat, when I know how much it disgusts him. I get his point and I apologized to him, bit I still don't think that it's *that bad* to eat a bit of turkey once, to not make a weird first impression on my family. AITA? edit: a few people are asking why there was nothing else that he could've eaten and like I said, there were of course some other snacks and a couple of different sauces, but nothing that would've been considered a decent meal without the turkey.

She was super excited since I guess you would call her a superfan. I definitely feel like she's too old to put so much stock in kpop, but I generally don't talk to her about it, since it's pretty harmless, just annoying. She was told that she could bring a plus one with her to the station to meet the band, and so she took me with her. Even in the car, she was so excited that she was shaking, and she kept saying that she wasn't sure she could do it. (I didn't care either way, I wanted it over with!) The meeting was honestly nothing special, all the band members said hi to her and shook her hand or offered her like a platonic hug. She cried for most of it (awkward) and kept bowing to the members (she's white) and while I didn't say anything, I was SO embarrassed for her. Some of the guys also shook my hand and greeted me, but a few of them didn't, probably noticing that I wasn't really into it. Whatever, it wasn't for me it was for her, I'm not a fan. She has some other friends who are also kpop fans, and when we all hung out later, she started talking about how wonderful and surreal it was to meet her idols. I then started laughing and telling her friends about how awkward she was, how she bowed to all of them despite none of them bowing to her, and made a joke about how they probably laughed at her once she was out of earshot. Complete silence, immediately everyone is death glaring at me. I try to clarify that she really was acting CRAZY for a 23 year old (I even looked up the band and half of them are teenagers!) and she retaliates that she probably made them feel less awkward than me, who didn't even talk to them. What the fuck, was I supposed to talk to a bunch of Korean guys I don't know? We ended up arguing about it privately but it's been a sore spot and we just don't bring it up. She barely even listens to kpop around me now. Fast forward to now, a year-ish later. My girlfriend just bought 2 NCT tickets for her and her friend, which were very expensive and include YET ANOTHER fan meet. I mention buying a ticket myself so I can go along with them (not to the fanmeet though) and my girlfriend said she'd rather me not go because she doesn't want me to be bored or embarrassed. The way she said it was so cold, for absolutely no reason, and I feel like she's being so passive aggressive over a joke that I made AGES ago. AITA for laughing at my adult girlfriend's teenage fangirl antics??",

        "selftext": "Our son is 22 and our daughter is 26. She bought a house in July. We know that moving into a new home always comes with unexpected costs, right after you've probably depleted most of your funds. So, for Christmas we gave her $4000. Our son we gave a few different gifts totaling somewhere around $800. Our daughter had to work Christmas, but we did Christmas on the 26th and she stayed with us for the holidays from then until yesterday. Our son still lives with us, and today he told us both that he didn't want to say anything while his sister was here, but his feelings were hurt by the disparity in the value of the gifts. We explained that the gifts we got him were tailored to his interests, but his sister has just passed a big life milestone where money is more important to her right now than sentiment. He said it's still hurtful because it feels like we are more proud of her than him. My wife got really frustrated when he said that and asked why he would choose the least charitable interpretation of our actions. He said that's just how he felt and he couldn't control it. I said that we didn't give her money because we were more proud, but because we had experience being new homeowners and knowing that something always breaks in that first six months and it's always expensive. He said that was all fine and good, but it still hurt to get a worse present and feel like an afterthought. My wife asked if he expected us to get him four thousand dollars worth of gifts. He said no, but he expected the gifts between him and his sister to be equal. My wife said that's the same thing, and my son said it isn't. He said we could have given her the monetary equivalent of what we gave him. I told him that it isn't really fair for him to decide how much we spend on someone else's gift. Furthermore, cash is less personal than gifts, so giving her a cash equivalent to what he got would be her getting the worse gift. He said we weren't listening to him, just justifying. My wife said we didn't need to justify anything, and he was being entitled. At that point he said he didn't want to talk unless everyone was civil and he went to his room. He skipped lunch (breakfast for him) today, and when he left for work he didn't say goodbye even though I was right by the door. My wife is irritated, and my son is clearly resenting us. I can't really decide if we're in the wrong here. On the one hand, we should be able to give our money to whoever we want. On the other, I never want to hurt my son's feelings. Were we wrong?",

Before Christmas, she told me that she had a surprise gift for me, and seemed really excited about it. I told her I was really looking forward to it as well, and prepared her gift myself (which was actually art supplies).  On Christmas when we had our family gathering, she brought me her gift, and was super excited for me to open it. When I opened it, I saw a crocheted animal, but if I'm being honest, it looked REALLY REALLY bad. To give you an idea of what it looked like, imagine something from r/badtaxidermy but in crochet form. I couldn't help but burst out laughing, and I couldn't stop laughing no matter how hard I tried to suppress it, so I had to excuse myself to go to the washroom, where I locked myself for nearly 10 minutes.  When I came out, my niece was in tears with her parents trying to console her, and I apologized profusely and told her that I really liked her gift, but she kept crying and shouted at me, calling me a liar and that she sucked at art.  My niece avoided me for the vast majority of the party after that. I tried to make her feel better by displaying her gift on my living room cabinet, but my wife pulled me aside later in the day and told me to take it down after the party because it was in her words, really ugly and made her uncomfortable. Surprisingly, all the adults was very understanding of my situation, but I feel really bad because I feel like I destroyed my niece's confidence, and I'm not sure how I can make it up to her.",

        "selftext": "I met my wife in my early 30s. She was in her mid 20s at the time. I was already well established and had made a significant amount of money working as a quant and investing my savings diligently. She on the other hand had never gone to college and was content working for basically minimum wage.  So when I meet her we click instantly and I fall head over heels for her. We get married and move in together, and soon after have three kids. When we were expecting our first born she had told me she wanted to be a stay at home mom. Obviously I was jealous but I went along with it since it seemed logical. So she spends the next 20+ years as a stay at home mom taking care of our kids while I work 12 hour days and then some. I\u2019m not demeaning stay at home moms by the way, but in the context of our marriage she had an extremely easy going life style. A couple years ago I discovered she had been cheating on me with her friend\u2019s husband. Divorced obviously followed. The only major asset we had in the US was our house, which was a premarital asset. We had a shared bank account, but since I am a finance guy I handled all our investments, and for tax reasons invested it abroad in my home country.  Now if we had just grown apart, or she said she was unhappy, I\u2019d have no problem paying what\u2019s fair. But the fact she cheated on me is what makes me resent paying her a cent.  So in the divorce she is awarded half of our investments made during marriage, >90% of which are abroad in my name, along with alimony for 20 years for 30% of my pay. So here I am given an opportunity to get out of this entirely by moving back to my home country and never looking back. So I sell our house as fast as possible, move the money abroad, and move back to my home country while stringing her along about why it\u2019s taking so long to liquidate our savings. Once abroad I immediately stop alimony payments. Now she has no legal recourse (I\u2019ve double checked with lawyers) and is left with her share of the small amount we had in the states. The reason I\u2019m asking here is that my own children are split on this. My son is on my side 100%, while my daughters are 90% on their mothers side. I figured it would be interesting to see the opinions of people here.",

I've been embarrassed about it in the past. our oldest rode the school bus for the first time. my wife was waiting at the stop with our daughter and had her hand the bus driver a bag of homemade cookies. then when she picked her up from the stop in the afternoon, she gave a bag to the afternoon driver. I asked why she did that when she could easily have just said thank you and left it at that. she said the bus drivers work so hard having to comfort all the nervous kids and handling the unbehaved one while driving they deserve more than a thanks. I reminded her that this has embarrassed me in the past and I think her behaviors are too extreme. I wouldn't want gifts from someone I don't know. she ignored how I felt.

I asked my husband how long it's been there and he said 2 months. I got upset and pointed out that it was not wise of him to use a pic of my son as his homescreen wallpaper for strangers to see. He said pretty much, almost no one touches his phone so I shouldn't worry about my son's pic seen by strangers. I told him they don't have to touch his phone to see his iphone homescreen. he said I should relax because it's not like he posted it on social media and besides that he only used my son's pic as his homescreen wallpaper to be able to look at him all the time because he misses him when he's at work. I demanded he remove it but he said no. I insisted and an argument ensued to the point where I got up, paid my part of the bill then walked out of the restaurant. He decided to stay at a hotel because he was overwhelmed and texted me about how deeply I hurt him and told me he removed the picture entirely from his phone if that would make me happy. then went on to say I overreacted and by the looks of it, he's expecting an apology from ME!! after what happened. was ITA or was he?",

We had a daughter who is 16, a son who is 13 and a daughter who is 5. He's always been a good dad, and we split 50/50 custody, essentially the kids one week my house/one week his house. After my divorce, I reconnected with a high school boyfriend and fell head over heels in love again. He's in the military but hadn't had to move in years. We married 2 years ago.  A year ago, he got orders to move to Texas from where we all were in California. My older two kids were not happy at all, and didn't want to move, while the baby didn't really express a preference. I approached my ex and told him the situation. I said I know the situation sucks, but we'd foot the bill to him for every trip to him on holidays, breaks, summers, etc. He blew his top and said absolutely not, I wouldn't take his kids away and said he'd see me in court. The judge ended up ruling in his favor, and I was awarded summers and every other holiday. I was absolutely devastated. I moved, and I've barely seen the kids since. They came at Christmas for a week, and it was tense the whole time. The older kids, especially my daughter, are short with me on FaceTime, while the baby gets distracted and can't chat much.

        "selftext": "So this month I was flying across the country on a long 5 hour flight, which I had booked and seats selected for. I specifically chose an aisle seat in a row of two, so no middle seat \u2014 just the aisle and window.  Well, a very obese man boards and I can tell instantly he is going to have a tough time fitting in any of the seats. I assume maybe he bought two hence why he\u2019s even attempting to board. I\u2019m mentally crossing my fingers he\u2019s not next to me, but sure enough he ends up pointing to the window seat next to me to let him in.  I get up and let him in politely, wanting to at least give him a chance. Well, he sits down and is easily seeping into about 1/3 of my seat. I sit down and am pressed up against him, making me uncomfortable. After a minute, I decided to be upfront and tell him: \u201cSir, I\u2019m sorry but this situation is not working for me, you\u2019re taking up quite a bit of my seat\u201d.  He wasn\u2019t rude, but sort of gave me a shrug as if there\u2019s not nothing he can do \u2014 although he did sort of tighten his arms in to try and be narrower. It just wasn\u2019t enough, though. He still was overhanging over the armrest about 1/4th into my seat even when squeezing his arms in. I\u2019m talking about fully hanging over the armrest into my seat.  I end up stopping a flight attendant and ask her what can be done about the situation. She instantly tells him that he is likely going to need to purchase another seat. She goes to the front and comes back saying that there aren\u2019t any open seats on this flight, so there wasn\u2019t a way to move people so he could have two. This causes a very awkward silence.  The guy seemed embarrassed and didn\u2019t want to get up. He mentioned how he can\u2019t wait for a later flight. I felt bad for him but I was also thinking about my own comfort on the long flight \u2014 the comfort I paid for. The flight attendant tells him that unless someone on the flight agrees to let him take up part of their seat, he\u2019ll need to book another flight. The guy seems really flustered by this ultimatum, and here\u2019s where I made my offer.  I told the guy, \u201cLook, I\u2019ll put up with this if you give me $150 \u2014 that\u2019s half the cost of this flight and that would compensate me enough for the circumstances.\u201d He instantly agrees, pulls out cash and pays me. He even told me he appreciated it.  Well the people sitting behind me (who keep in mind didn\u2019t volunteer to sit by him) were making under their breath comments about me being an asshole for doing that. I just ignored them and put the cash in my wallet.  From my perspective, I gave the guy a valid option to stay on the flight and I was compensated for literally having only 75% of my seat max (let alone the feeling of a person\u2019s body pressed against you involuntarily). A win-win. He wasn\u2019t angry at all, if anything he seemed quite relieved we could work it out privately.  After the flight, the couple behind me glared at me but I ignored them. This leads me to beg the question, AITA? ",

        "selftext": "My (48M) daughter (21F), Aria, abandoned us (her stepmother, younger half-sister and me) when she was 15 to go live with my enabling ex-wife, Sandra, and her husband. Until then, we had 50/50 custody, but Sandra has always been less strict than me. She's always let Aria do what she wants and has never had any home rules. She also buys Aria everything she wants so she will want to live with her.  Sandra lives in the same town where Aria's highschool was, while I live 25 mins away. So, one of my rules was that if she went to meet up with a friend there (meaning I had to drive her), the next time they met it was her friend's turn to come. If the friend's parents didn't want to drive the kid here, then Aria wasn't allowed to meet them again while she was with me. Everything was fine that way for years.  The major fallout happened in her last year of highschool (she was 15). She went on a trip to another country with her school and didn't bother to send more than a couple texts when she was away for 5 days. So I decided to ground her, because she had to learn to respect and show some love for her family. She insisted she had sent messages to her mother but we had barely heard from her.\u00a0 She's never had a lot of friends, but she had been invited her to some popular girl's birthday party. This was my punishment, not going to that party after forgetting about her family. She got upset and started calling her mother to come pick her up, but it was illegal to get her if it was my week. Plus, she wanted to go to her mother's because she would lift my punishment and let her go to the party. Her mother came by the end of the week and I told Aria that she didn't have to come back if she didn't want to. I waited, but I heard nothing from her again. Her sister kept asking me why she didn't come back, and I didn't know how to explain to her that she didn't love us and that she preferred staying with her mother, her parties and her free-of-rules life. Over the years we've communicated through lawyers, because Sandra has 0 intentions on helping me get my daughter back (she finally has her to herself). They've been demanding that I pay for child support, even now that she's 21 years old. I have to pay for that and for half of her college expenses (by law). When Aria turned 18, an adult, I started adding up everything I had to pay in an Excel that I send to Sandra when I update it so she knows what damage she is doing to our daughter (I expect Aria to pay her debt, but I gave Sandra the option to pay for her to which she refused). We are now at 18K. Aria has been trying to get in touch again. I told her that we can't fix the emotional part unless we fix the money part first. She needs to prove to me that she doesn't only care about the money. Sandra says I'm an asshole but I think she is, since she has done nothing but try to take my daughter away and she finally has what she wants. So, AITA?",

I have full custody and her mom is not involved in her life.  5 years ago I married my wife Nina(F31) we tried to have a child but couldn't. We went to the doctor and turned out I can't have anymore kids due to some complications. We decided to use an sperm donor and the result was a son, Mark, who was born a few months ago.  The problems started when Nina got pregnant. Harper wasn't happy about it. When Mark was born things got worse. Before this Harper and I used to spend 2 days a week together, just the 2 of us without my wife but after Mark was born I couldn't do that anymore. I can't just leave my wife alone for 2 days a week with a newborn and Harper has been very angry about it.  The main problem started 3 days ago. Nina and I decided to make a nursery for Mark instead of having him in our bedroom for multiple reasons.  Our home has 4 bedrooms, 2 master bedrooms at one side and 2 bedrooms at the other side. One of the master rooms is ours, the other one is Harpers. It was very hard for Nina and I to go to the other side of the home multiple times at night when Mark wakes up so I asked Harper pack her stuff and go to one of the bedrooms so that we could give her room to Mark. At first everything seemed alright. She said ok and went to her room and started packing but less than an hour later my brother showed up at our home, asking for Harper. She had called him and asked him to take her. She came out of her room with her stuff, told me you can give it to your son now and left with my brother. I told her she could only go for one night but it has been 3 days and she is not back and wont even talk to me.  Im receiving calls from my family all calling me an AH and other names.  I dont trust their judgement, they very clearly favor Harper. She was the first grandchild in our family and everyone's favorite also they are trying to accept Mark as my son but I could see that they haven't been able yet so I decided to post here and get some unbiased opinions. AITA? Edit: Here is the update that I promised  I realized I've messed up so I went to my brothers home and tried to get Harper back but he didn't even let me see her, saying she doesn't want to see me.  He said he would only let her go back if:  1. She wanted to go with me  2. We move to another home close to their home because they wanted to have Harper close to them to keep an eye on her and make sure we are treating her right, we used to live very close to them but when I got married my wife and family didn't get along so we moved somewhere farther away which made Harper very sad.  3. Harper will get to choose which bedroom she wants in our new home  4. I should spend 1 on 1 time with Harper at least one day a week  Which I accepted.  This caused a lot of problems since my wife doesn't like some of those conditions. she thinks they are not reasonable. She got angry, took Mark and went to her parents home and is staying there so now I'm also receiving texts from my inlaws calling me an AH.  Right now Im looking for a new home that is closer to my brother's home  I called Harper and my brother convinced her to talk to me for once. she was crying the whole time while telling me that she felt like I didn't want her anymore. Hearing her cry like that really broke my heart. I honestly never meant to hurt her.  After so many apologies and gifts she finally agreed to see me. I will go to my brother's home everyday to spend time with Her. She has also finally agreed to come home with me when I find a new home.",

        "selftext": "My 9yo son needed hip bone osteoma surgery and his mom and I scheduled it before his three week winter break. My ex and I share 50/50 but I get him on winter breaks so she could take him our of state to see her family in the summer. The day before the surgery she asked me if Ry could stay at her place to recover from the surgery. I asked her why and all she said was that she just wanted to be there. I said no. Ry has never had surgery and it's a big deal for him. I don't want him to think that the first thing you when you face something scary is run to your mom and not your dad. I told her I was quite insulted by her request. Plus he was going to need help getting dressed, undressed and bathed for the first couple of days and I highly doubt that he'd be comfortable having his mom do that. She said her husband could do that. I told her no. He's having the surgery and I'm taking him to my house when he's released. I don't care if she's in the operating room.  She then asked if she could see him at my place and I said no. The agreement is that we have scheduled FaceTime with him when he's at the other parent's house. I don't want my ex wife in my home anymore than she wants me in hers. If the shoe was on the other foot then I'd understand whether I liked it or not.  I held firm and things have been tense between us ever since. Personally I don't care because I'm not apologizing for not giving her what she wanted. Edit: No, my son doesn't get to decide who he gets to stay with and when and for how long. That's why there are custody agreements.",

The other day my 12 yo stepson fell off the stairs and injured his anckle, his dad and I had to get him to the hospital and needed someone to stay with the kids while we were there. My boyfriend told my son to skip workday and stay with and watch his stepbrothers. When we returned, My son asked my boyfriend to pay him for babysitting his kids I admit my son doesn't have the best relationship with his stepdad or stepsiblings but My boyfriend and I were shocked by this. My son explained that he had to skip a workday which cost him to lose money and asked my boyfriend to pay him for his time. My boyfriend scolded him harshly and told him that staying home with his stepbrothers isn't babysitting and he deserves no money for it. plus that skipping one day of work won't do much harm. but my son disagreed and kept arguing with my boyfriend saying his stepbrothers aren't his responsibility. My boyfriend ended up punishing him and taking away all his electronics as well as cancelling his birthday months away. My son fought back talking about how unfair this was and asked me to get involved. I sided with my boyfriend because I really did not appreciate how my son used this family emergency to his advantage and thought he'd get money out of helping family out. My son didn't like where I stood in this conflict and accused me of favoring my stepkids to stay on my boyfriend's good side while ignoring the mistreatment towards him. I cut the argument and he's become silent eversince. even refused to eat with us or sit with us. AITA for agreeing with my boyfriend to punish my son?",

She cooks all her own food and uses that money to buy a coffee each morning. She always goes to the same coffee shop.  Me and my gf are very comfortable and she's bi so sometimes we will both say how hot a girl is or whatever. She always says the guy who serves her coffee is beautiful, she confirmed that she wasn't attracted to him but that he was stunning and a very pretty man. That was fine.  Anyway, so she goes in every day and always has stories to tell about the guy behind the counter. I trust her ENTIRELY, I know she doesn't really want him and wouldn't do anything.  Anyway, I went in the other day and straight away knew who she meant as this gorgeous long haired dude took my order. I ordered her favourite drink as she was at home and I shit you not he said oh is that for Emma? And when I looked shocked he went I just know that's her usual, no one else really orders it. I said yes, it is but by the way pal, she has a boyfriend and it's me. The guy kinda laughed and i said that I appreciate he's doing his job but to lay off her as in my eyes, I think he was flirting. He laughed again and said sure thing.  I didn't tell my gf who went to get coffee a few days later and came home raging, saying how dare I embarrass her like that. This pissed me off cause why doesn't she want him to know?! She said she already mentioned me and that the guy is gay and she knows his boyfriend. Fair, innocent mistake on my behalf but the gf never told me this beautiful man was gay.  She stormed out and still won't speak to me without making sly digs.

        "selftext": "Last fall, my husband and I went to my cousin's wedding in another state.  In the months leading up to the wedding, my aunt (cousin's mother) griped about how unconventional the wedding was going to be. She was happy for the couple of course but she didn't like that the wedding wasn't going to be in a church or banquet hall. The wedding was going to be a small and intimate affair in a scenic national park and then the reception was going to be in a nice rental house in the woods. I thought it sounded cool and unique but my aunt hated the idea of it. She didn't tell the couple tho. Just complained about it to us behind their backs.  We traveled 600 miles to the wedding. We treated the trip like a vacation. Spent some money on lodging, food, sightseeing, etcetera.  The day before the wedding, my aunt rounded up me and my family members and told us that she just found out that the dress code for the wedding was casual. Not gonna lie, many of us were stoked. I hate dressing up so I was all over the idea of a casual backyard bbq wedding.  My husband and I had already packed nice clothes so we wore them to the ceremony. A few of my family members showed up to the ceremony in t-shirts and baseball caps. Immediately after, we changed into comfortable clothes for the reception. I wore a hoodie, daisy Duke shorts and cute sandals.  I noticed that the bride's family members were still dressed up but I figured they didn't get the memo. The bride and groom and the wedding party were dressed to the nine's which I thought was weird for a casual wedding. The reception was awesome. Nice dinner, fancy lawn games, a bonfire. We had a blast.  So we just found out that the bride and groom were very upset with us for wearing casual clothes to their wedding. They thought it was very disrespectful. Apparently my aunt lied to us because she wanted to sabotage their wedding and they were upset that no one checked with them about the dress code. This explains why my cousin and his wife have been standoffish toward us since the wedding.  TBH we think they're overreacting because we all had fun at their wedding and it's not our fault we got bad info about the dress code. And they never specified the dress code in the invitation. But I still have to ask. AITA?",

I was outside setting up and suddenly my wife comes outside yelling about how the grocery store screwed up the birthday cake and I didn't notice. All that happened was that they spelled our daughter's name as Sarah and it's Sara and I said, who cares, just scrape off the H but she insisted on returning it. So I said fine whatever. And then as she's leaving she says since I screwed up already I should make upfor it by finishing the decorations.  And I go into the kitchen and I ask my daughter, what's the most important thing? She says the gift bags. I found all the candy and toys and what I thought were the bags they were supposed to go into. So I make up the bags, my daughter helps, and she thinks they look great and she's happy with them. My wife comes home and takes over, satisfied by the new cake and the attempt I made at helping. So a little while after that, the guests arrive. The day went pretty well until the end. My daughter reminds us that they need to hand out gift bags. My wife panics thinking she forgot about them, but she says dont worry, dad made them and she looked so relieved until I got the box. She looked inside an was horrified What the fuck is this? she whispers. And she thrusts the box back at me and rushes to the bedroom. I follow her and find her sitting on the bed crying. She's SO embarrassed. Why? She wont say. I'm not sure what to do because people are trying to leave and they're confused as to whats going on. I then I just take over goodbye duty and hand out the bags to kids at the door and say bye with my daughter. Well halfway through doing that my wife came back out and took the box from me and brought it into the bedroom and threw it on the ground. wtf? she finally tells me those are dog poop bags and basically I'm stupid and I've ruined all the hard work she put into the party. well, reddit, they dont look like dog poop bags. they're just small pink bags with hearts on them. who really cares? I tell her It's not like they're dirty. they're small bags like any other bags and damn it she freaked. She says she's so mortified she doesnt even want to show her face at the school anymore. So yeah I've been bringing my daughter to school every day this week (which has been making me late for work). my wife will barely even speak to me even though my daughter thinks everything was fine. she laughed when i told her they were really dog poop bags. my wife got even more mad at me for telling her. I told my wife she needs to chill and she basically said I was a huge asshole and she's mad that I dont think it's a big deal. and I still dont. Actually, I think I'm the one that should be mad at HER for keeping this going for almost a week. So, Reddit, AITA? TL;DR: I used dog poop bags as goody bags by accident for 6 year old daughter's bday party",

I told her I had already bought the necklace and I didn\u2019t see any reason for a ring since I didn\u2019t propose with one.

So, me and my girlfriend have been dating for almost 3 years. We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)I will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.This all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.I told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b-bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.She was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.). Am I being the asshole here? EDIT:Here\u2019s an update, for people who wanted it.

        "selftext": "My late wife Kate passed away about 12 years ago. They have a family heirloom that has passed down several generations (starting from her great grandmother) from mothers to their first daughters, on their 18th (or thereabouts) birthdays. The heirloom itself is not highly valuable in a financial sense, but the history makes it very valuable to the people in the family. I currently possess it after Kate passed away and I always intended to give it to my daughter, Claire, on her 18th birthday. She is currently 16. I married my current wife about 8 years ago. My step daughter, Sarah, (whom I have adopted and consider my own daughter) is 17 years and 11 months old, her 18th birthday is in a month. My wife has also adopted Claire and we all consider each other as just one family. My wife asked me to give the heirloom to Sarah on her birthday to continue the tradition. I was hesitant because I always intended it to give it to Claire who is Kate's only daughter as this is what she would have wanted and is the continuation of the tradition. My wife counters that this belongs to our family now and we should give it to our eldest daughter on her 18th birthday, and therefore this should be Sarah. I told her that while I consider Sarah to be my daughter but she's not Kate's daughter, this belongs to Kate and should go to Kate's daughter. My wife said Claire is HER daughter, not anyone else's and wife accused me of playing favorites and told me that if I truly consider Sarah to be my daughter then I'll do the right thing for her or that I haven't really accepted Sarah as a real daughter yet. I consulted my son (from Kate, 25 years old) and he told me that if I do this he's going to walk from the birthday party and that he bets he won't be the only one. He said if I do this I should be ready for severe consequences. He left in a very frustrated way. His argument in the end was that this isn't yours to give away. It was mom's and now belongs to Claire. My wife thinks my son is overreacting and it's only because due to his age and moving out he's never bonded with Sarah like Claire and I have, so he doesn't consider Sarah to be his real sister, otherwise he'd be happy for her. My wife thinks Claire will be happy about this since she considers Sarah to be her big sister and it will bring the girls even closer together because Sarah will happily share it with Claire and they'll both have it. So would I be the asshole if I did what my wife wants me to do and give the heirloom to Sarah?",

You can't tell who's right or who's wrong, there's always this ongoing tension between them but can be civil enough to sit together at one table. I recently got an invitation for christmas celebration from my parents. The invitation including me and Luke but Luke thought this was somewhat rude and a disrespectful because he believes he should get his own invitation and not have his name mentioned as an extention to mine. We talked and he said he wouldn't go unless they send him a proper invitation. I called mom and asked if she could do it. She thought it was ridiculous and said that she and dad did the same with my sister and her husband. I told her it was fine but Luke can be sensitive like that and so a simple invitation in a form of a text directly to him will fix it. She got defensive and said that Luke is being ridiculous. Dad claimed that Luke is trying to pull some power move to humiliate them but I thought this was a small issue. They still thought it was ridiculous so I told them I won't attend if they don't send him a separate invitation because he won't attend if he doesn't get it. This blew up and my sister started arguing saying Luke needs to get over himself and shamed me for trying to force our parents to send him an invitation by saying I won't come if they don't. We haven't talked after that and we're waiting as of now. edit! The invitation I recieved was in a text. Luke is saying that a simple text to him will finish the conflict but my parents still think it's ridiculous and that they won't invite him since they already have. **UPDATE! I just got off the phone with my sister. She told me our parents have just disinvited me (Luke was probably already disinvited since the argument occured) from the celebration. I feel horrible but I can't argue anymore, just like I can't argue about what everybody else in the comments is saying. I admit it! Luke is the problem. He just caused me to be disinvited from the event and is blaming ME for it.**",

This includes our groceries, which we have a set $ amount we spend, no more.  Recently our DD dropped the milk and spilled it. It was 5 days to payday and we\u2019d already done our grocery shopping. My wife said she\u2019d figure it out. I know she has a little money stashed for herself that she\u2019s gotten from selling some of her clothes recently, so when she came home with milk and a bag of chips for the kids as a treat, I figured she must have decided to dip into that. Boy was I wrong.  The next week I noticed our food was a little...higher quality. A couple of brand name things, even a roast on Sunday with asparagus. I figured she must have gotten some killer deals, but when I asked she said \u201coh no, I found a bunch of money off coupons.\u201d Then she showed a few to me.  They were those \u201cEarn 0.07$ a gallon\u201d receipts you get at the gas station. She had gone there and dug through the garbage! She said she got about 5$ worth of these receipts the first time when we needed milk, and went back the next week for more, netting about 30$ total.  I was speechless. I asked her how she could lower herself like that. She replied that she did it for our kids. When I asked why she didn\u2019t use her money she had saved, she said it was hers and she was saving it for something special.  I\u2019m so disgusted guys. I can\u2019t believe she did this. I don\u2019t even want to look at her. She on the other hand is mad at me, and says I\u2019m an asshole for being mad, and for expecting her to use her saved money instead. AITA for expecting my wife NOT to dumpster dive? Edit: OK! I am definitely the asshole. After reading all of your comments, I really thought about it. I talked to my wife, and told her I was sorry for the way I acted. She is annoyed but willing to forgive me. I was actually mad at myself. The reason we are struggling is because I was in an accident a few months ago. I slid through a stop light on an icy road. It has permanently affected my ability to work in the trade I\u2019ve worked in for 15 years. I\u2019m on disability through my employer but it isn\u2019t even half of what I used to make. We are getting by, but it is tight. And I don\u2019t know what we are going to do when it runs out. My wife is stretching every dollar (she takes care of the finances). I guess I was just mad at myself because I can\u2019t take care of my family anymore, and lashed out. I\u2019m going to give her a foot rub tonight. Thanks for the honesty guys. ",

We have a really good relationship, but I always worry about her not having a woman to talk to.  Over the past few months she hasn\u2019t really seemed to be herself, I know she went through a bad break up but I\u2019ve been worried it\u2019s more than that. I\u2019ve tried talking to her, and my sister only lives down the street so she\u2019s tried talking to her also, but my daughter is really keeping to herself and it concerns me.  She went out to see her friends for the first time since quarantine started yesterday and asked me if I could give her room a quick tidy whilst she was gone. I agreed because she does a lot of chores but she\u2019s not good at cleaning her room. Whilst I was putting clothes back in her closet, I stumbled upon what I now know to be her diary.  I shouldn\u2019t have read past the first page but I just wanted to know if there was anything going on she wasn\u2019t telling me about. There were some pretty heartbreaking stuff for a father to read about how down she felt about herself, so when she got home I brought it up to her.  She asked me why this was suddenly coming up and when I told her I\u2019d read her diary she absolutely flipped and told me it was an absolute violation of privacy and she\u2019s completely humiliated. I told her I was just trying to protect her and she said it was none of my business and locked herself in her bedroom and hasn\u2019t spoken to me since. AITA?",

        "selftext": " Me (M32) and my wife, Dahlia (F28) lost our apartment 2 months ago and moved in with mom temporarily. Issues began to arise between Dahlia and mom and I had to ask my friend, Anthony (M31) to let us move in til I get enough money to rent out. His wife was away visiting family and he agreed but even there, some issues started to arise. Fyi, Dahlia is very shy around Anthony. She grew up in conservative home and so it's understandable, but sometimes it can be a bit much I admit that!  For example, she freaked out when she accidently drank from his glass, she also once made a fuss when he passed by the guests room when she was lying down and the door was open. Thankfully, Anthony was super understanding and we were able to talk some of these issues out. Last night, Dahlia was passing the hall and noticed a framed picture of Anthony and his wife kissing hanging on the wall. She told me about it and said it made her uncomfortable. She asked if I could speak to Anthony about it but he didn't take it well. He gave me a look when I spoke to him and said this was bonkers because first of all, his wife put it there. And second of all, the picture holds sentimental meaning to him and his wife and argued that it wasn't some explicit picture of them, just a normal wedding kiss. We started arguing and he said that it wasn't like it was hanging in the living room wall or a perfectly lit room. I asked him to be a little more considerate because it's not like I asked him to remove it completely, just move it elsewhere that Dahlia won't reach or keep it off the wall til we leave. He said he was sorry but still refused. I explained how Dahlia was feeling but he said that again, he was sorry but would not move the picture. We argued some more and he said that it's his house and that I was being pushy and kind of too comfortable to make such demand and be pushy still. This morning, Dahlia refused to even come out of the room until the picture is moved. Anthony is refusing which makes it worse. Now I feel like I'm getting stuck between a rock and a hard place. Yes she might just be over reacting but I feel like this isn't such a big ask for Anthony to decline and turn down. fwiw If it were me, I'd go the extra mile to make sure my guests are comfortable. Anthony has been a friend of mine for 10 years. I wouldn't have asked to move in with him if I didn't have such strong bond with him. He himself constantly talks about all the things and situations I helped him out with and we are considered brothers.",

        "selftext": "I (27m) have been living with my girlfriend (29f) for several months now. For the most part things are really good and I plan to propose soon and hopefully have at least a couple of kids with her. However we've run up against a conflict. She's an absolute morning person. I hate mornings. By the time I force myself out of bed in the morning and into the shower she's already been up for at least 30 minutes--even though she has to be at work later than I do--and is at the stove making breakfast. She likes a huge breakfast in the morning. She usually has eggs, either French toast or pancakes, hashbrowns or breakfast potatoes, and sausage or bacon. Sometimes on weekends it's ham or steak. She eats almost nothing for lunch and usually has a smallish dinner but she loves a huge breakfast. Meanwhile I only ever have cold cereal for breakfast, or MAYBE if I'm feeling really ambitious some instant oatmeal and orange juice. I only even start to come alive halfway through my second cup of coffee and definitely don't feel like cooking in the morning. However my girlfriend obviously does. So recently I asked her if she'd start making breakfast for me, too. She asked if we were going to trade off and if I'd sometimes make breakfast for her, too. I told her no but reminded her that I do often make dinner for her. She said that since we trade off making dinner we should trade off making breakfast, too. I told her that there is no way I'll ever be able to muster that kind of energy first thing in the morning, but that since she obviously can that she should just make me breakfast too. I said that it would take next to no extra effort on her part to throw in a couple more eggs, strips of bacon, an extra portion of hashbrowns, etc since she's already doing it for herself, anyway. But it started a fight, with her saying that it wasn't fair for me to expect her to think of me in the morning since I don't do the same for her. She seems to think that her making breakfast for me should figure into our division of labor and that I should do something extra in return. But I think that since she makes a huge breakfast for herself every morning anyway that throwing an extra portion of whatever she's making on for me would take next-to no effort on her part, so why should I have to do more for her in return than I already do?",

To make sure we gave everyone enough time we got invitations ready 2 weeks in advance and I had my son pass them out Friday. We invited every one in his class (he goes to a small private school so there were only 15 kids to invite). Except for one child well call david.  The school my son goes to has a program for special needs kids where they are put into a normal class once a week. David is a high functioning autistic child who was put in my sons class to help him socialize and to help the other kids learn to not discriminate against special needs people. From what I know about him and his mother they are just doing their best, and I have nothing against either of them. However, there have been incidents with david before. Last year through friends I had heard that David had a meltdown at another party he was invited to. I don't know if I believe it but parents who were there say that it was because he wanted to open presents like the birthday boy and when told no freaked out. There are other logistical problems as well (The party will be in a loud arcade) so in the end I decided to not invite david.  Well, after my son passed the invitations word spread around that we had excluded the special needs child in his class. This got back to davids mother who called me last night and confronted me about this. She told me that I am awful for excluding her son and that i'm teaching my son to discriminate. When I brought up the logistics and the past incident she told me that i'm an asshole for assuming what her son can and cant do before hanging up. I woke up this morning to a passive aggressive post by her and many other parents are siding with her.  I just want my son to have a good party and didn't mean anything by this. AITA?",

I wasn't a huge fan of it but she said she wanted it for a while, but she was too afraid of being embarrassed if it turned out badly. But now that everyone is working from home, nobody can go out, she took the chance and she loves it. Then she bleached her brown hair to blonde. Then in a week she dyed it florescent green. And she was buying a lot of new clothes, crop tops and tank tops, really loud patterned pants, platform sneakers that look like running shoes but have a sole that's like 3 inches tall? Just generally flashy and eccentric stuff. And whenever I ask, she says that this is more her style but she's just been more comfortable getting into it when there's less social pressure. She's stopped wearing bras and that's also awkward because I can tell she gets stares I asked what she's going to do when she has to go back to work, and she said she'd dress appropriately but obviously couldn't change her hair. But she didn't think that would be a problem, she'd been practically indespensable during the difficult time the company was having recently, and she couldn't see there being any trouble over hair. I've said I also don't love her new look, and she's always like I don't look that different, like it's still me but honestly she does look really different. We had a fight after I asked her a couple times to just wear normal things when we hang out together, and she got really upset with me over it, saying that she was just trying to have some fun and try something different and it was really rude of me to tell her how to dress AITA for being annoyed with my girlfriend's change in style?",

        "selftext": "Throwaway account + obligatory mobile formatting apology. I (52M) am the father of 3 kids, 15F, 7F, and 7M. The last two are twins and are very close, having the tendency to copy each other. I love and adore them all equally. My son is not a very masculine kid, and is less interested in some of my hobbies because of this. He has always preferred whatever his mother and older sister did, like baking or dancing. I have no problem with this, I love him as he is, but to be honest, I\u2019m slightly disappointed that we haven\u2019t had the kind of amazing father-son bonding that I got to have with my Grandpa (my Dad died when I was pretty young) when I was a kid.   Since I\u2019m at home almost all the time now, I\u2019ve been seeing just *how* feminine his interests have gotten. Asking to help cook every meal, helping his older sister alter second-hand clothes, and playing pretend. He\u2019s even asked to have his sister paint his nails. I\u2019m not upset or bothered by it, but it isn\u2019t typical for young boys.  I\u2019ve been working out at home instead of at the gym because of our current circumstances, and when my son came in while I was lifting weights in the family room, he showed an interest in it. He was excited about the idea of having big muscles, and tried out some of the 5lb ones. Even though he mentioned being like She-Ra (from some new Netflix reboot, I think?), it was still progress in my eyes and it seemed like he was showing interest in masculine hobbies. I praised him and did the whole *\u201dwow, you\u2019re so strong!\u201d* thing in kid-talk to encourage him.  When his sisters walked in, the twin (7F) joined in. Like I said, they have the tendency to want to do what the other is doing so she expected the same kind of \u201cwow, so strong!\u201d stuff. When I wasn\u2019t as enthusiastic with her and focused on my son, my oldest got annoyed and asked why I was treating them differently. I explained to her that because he hadn\u2019t taken interest in these kinds of masculine hobbies before, I wanted to foster his own identity as a boy separate from his twin sister. She accused me of being misogynistic for this! She then said that I was TA for making his sister feel weaker and implying that I didn\u2019t approve of his feminine interests. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m TA, because there\u2019s no reason for my daughter to be inclined towards this kind of thing, but my son should be developing a more masculine personality as he gets older.  When she told my wife (41F), she also blew up at me, saying I was acting like a cartoon misogynist. Both of them are pissed. So, Reddit, AITA? |Edit:| Hey everyone. I was 100% TA. I appreciate that some people tried to empathize and say NTA or NAH to be charitable, but I\u2019m in the wrong here and I knew it deep down while I was writing the post. Re-reading it, I feel ridiculous for writing that all out. I want to say thank you, because these comments where the objective kick in the ass I really needed! I realize now that I was really out of line for saying that shit and making my daughters feel that way. I set up a stupid false dichotomy, and my daughter was very right, I was being a misogynist. No excuse for that. I apologized to both of them and my wife an hour after I posted. I also shared this post with my little brother, who, as I mentioned in a comment, was teased for being effeminate as a kid/teen, especially after he came out. I think some people took me mentioning that as blaming him, which wasn\u2019t my intention at all- none of my behavior is his or anybody else\u2019s fault.  We talked for a while and that (along with many of the comments you guys left!)  made me aware of how badly I\u2019m treating my son. My Grandpa, who raised my brother and I for most of our lives, was a \u201cmanly\u201d guy who I\u2019ve always idolized completely. Well, my brother made me aware that my Grandpa in particular made him feel shitty about his femininity and his sexual orientation. He would regularly say degrading, terrible things. I was oblivious to just how much that hurt him, and it seems that I\u2019ve picked up some of these same ideas. I\u2019ve been such a dick for so long, and now that I realize how absurd some of the ideas I\u2019ve held onto are, I know how much of a disservice I\u2019ve done to my boy. I shouldn\u2019t try to make him change just to protect him from bullies. In this situation, I\u2019m the bully as much as it hurts to think.  I\u2019m planning on talking with him about this issue and apologizing. If we can this week, I want to let him choose something that he likes that we can do together. I\u2019m not going to make the same mistakes my Grandpa did. At my brother\u2019s and some redditors\u2019 suggestions, I\u2019m considering trying out therapy or a support group. After a mistake (huge fuck up) like this, I think I ought to try to be the best dad (and big brother!) I can be and work to stop thinking that way, especially when I\u2019ve already done so much damage.  I\u2019m sorry about the extremely long edit, but thank you for your responses and helping me with this issue. I showed my wife some comments and she also thanks you all! |Edit 2|: This will probably be the final update, but wow! I\u2019m overwhelmed will all the responses, I wasn\u2019t expecting so many. Thank you to everyone, I\u2019m glad you guys were honest (but still encouraging!). I\u2019m sorry I haven\u2019t been able to reply to you all. I got a lot of really kind and personal messages and I want you guys to know I\u2019ve taken it to heart. Some people asked what I\u2019m going to do with my daughters, since it seems like I focused more on my son in the edit. My oldest wants to try Krav Maga, so in the coming weeks we\u2019re hoping to find a place that\u2019ll accommodate both ages. Youngest daughter has wanted to learn how to roller skate too, so my 15 year old may have to teach us both! I was able to talk to my son for a while this morning and apologize for yesterday. Talking about gender roles and all the trauma surrounding my Grandpa may be something I\u2019ll talk to him more about as he gets older, but I got the message across that I support whatever he\u2019s interested in. I asked him about She-Ra (some commenters told me that it\u2019s fun for adults too) and we watched a few episodes together. You guys were right! My oldest and I both thought it was very cute. I asked him what he would want to do together, and he mentioned trying to alter something. I brought down a box of my old stuff from the attic and lo and behold- I found one of the 80s Hawaiian shirts my grandpa bought me (probably an effort to make me look like Tom Selleck). With some guidance from my oldest, we\u2019re going to try to make it fit my son with room for him to grow into it. I think it\u2019ll turn out nicely, and because it\u2019s \u201creally vintage\u201d my 15 year old loves it.  So everything is pretty good right now. I invited my brother over (lives a few hours away) for dinner so my son and I can make him something. I can\u2019t believe that I was feeling upset about him liking baking and everything, I\u2019m lucky that my boy wants to help everyone. So, I\u2019m definitely TA, but I\u2019m slowly becoming NTA! Thank you all. I showed my oldest some of my favorite comments and she thinks they\u2019re great and I should expect a \u201cclown of the year\u201d award for a father\u2019s day gift, haha!",

        "selftext": "Title sounds very bad and horribly racist, but let me clarify: So my brother (He's 25) has been dating an American-born girl to indian parents since last year (She's 23). Her parents do not like their relationship because he's White and probably prefer her to find an indian man. He has been trying to gain their approval but failing and from what he said, they continue to shrug him off and actively exclude him if she tries to bring him to her family events.  This has annoyed me because my brother is one of the nicest people I know. In the mean time, I proposed to my girlfriend and we're sending out invites to everyone. I came to the difficult decision that since his gf's family will not accept him, we will not accept her. I talked it over with my girlfriend and told her how strongly I feel about this and she agreed. I didn't want to spring this up on her, so I asked his gf if we could meet up and I sat down with her and explained that in good conscious, I could not invite her to our wedding if her family cannot accept my brother and I essentially boiled it down to if they don't want my brother, we don't want you. I told her she will be banned from all of our future family events until something changes with her parents in regards to my brother.  She got upset about it and this caused a huge divide in my family. My brother obviously is against it but I wanted to do it out of support for him. Other relatives agreed this was the right thing to do, but I've been seeking judgement from outside my family to gain a clearer perspective if I was being an asshole in making this decision? EDIT: I just want to clarify to all the posters that I am NOT doing this to punish her or her family. She still hangs around her family a lot and given that her family is disrespectful to my brother, I feel that makes her toxic and I do not want toxic people at my wedding. If she disowns her family then she can come",

My husband and I are more than happy to have them stay for few weeks til they get this resolved. However, Yesterday at 7pm, I was in the kitchen when my husband rushed in and said that he saw both my sister and her husband walk out of the bathroom. They'd most likely taken a shower together. My husband said that it irked him and I agreed that what they did was somewhat inappropriate. He asked me to speak to my sister on the matter and I did. She got defensive asking how this is affecting me or my husband in any way. I told her that it made my husband feel uncomfortable and would rather that they just take their showers seperately. She started ranting about being overwhelmed by their son's health problems and not having some alone time together as a married couple and found this activity as a bonding time to spend together. I apologized for how she felt but requested that she just do as asked. She got mad at me and said that I was being inconsiderate and she didn't understand my husband's hangup on what she and her husband do. We started arguing and she stormed off to the guests room where my nephew and BIL are. She's not speaking to me but my husband said I did the right thing by speaking to her and setting this boundary. AITA? Am I (and my husband) overreacted to this? Some infos: 1. My husband did not mention hearing anything, just that he saw them get out of the bathroom. And yes they were clothed. 2. It's the only bathroom in the house. 3. They spent apprximately 10+ in the shower according to my husband.

They have actually been friends since high school, and so my husband and I have known her for a few years as well.  She is a lovely girl, but honestly she is not someone I had hoped would be the mother to my first grandchild. First of all, she is a recovering drug addict and alcoholic, and while she says she has been clean for 3 years, a relapse is always possible. She only finished high school with her GED, and she now works as a waitress full time. Her parents died years ago, so she is largely on her own. Our family is considerably better off, and my son is joining his father's business, meaning his salary will be quite high and will only continue to grow.  Since my son first told us she is pregnant, it can't escape my mind that he may not really he the father, and that she picked him out of potential others because he would be the best in terms of support.  My son is pushing us to help her with some of her pregnancy expenses, and I told him we would under the condition that she get a paternity test first. He completely blew up at that, accusing us of disliking her (untrue) and not wanting to he grandparents (also untrue). He says he loves her and trusts her and that he can't wait to meet his baby. I get that, but I think he's being idealistic. If he wants our support, we want a paternity test first. If the baby is truly his then we would be happy to welcome her into our family and we would be happy to help her out. AITA? Edit: there are 7k replies to this post, and over 200 private messages in my inbox that I can't reply to. It's a pretty even mix of YTA and NTA, so clearly the only thing everyone can agree with is that it's complicated. I've gotten messages to kill myself, I've gotten messages calling my son an idiot, and I have gotten messages from the MGTOW subreddit telling me that the girlfriend is clearly a lying sociopath. I have also gotten a lot of messages from men who found out their child wasn't theirs after several years, who wish they had found out sooner.  It's a lot to read, and a lot to think about. Many people have called out my attitude towards this girl and I'll be honest, it is making me think.",

        "selftext": "My (39M) wife (34F) and I live in at a suburban house with our daughter (10F, Emily). Our neighbour next door (48M, Walter) is a single father with two daughters (14F and 12F). We have been living here for a little more than two years. My wife really likes watching scary movies but I have never enjoy them. I get too scared and end up having a bad time so I prefer to avoid them. Her friends sometimes go with her to the more popular ones but she also likes older, indies and foreign horror movies. She has always had a hard time finding people that have this niche interest and that is why it was such a big deal when we met Walter and found out he also shares this tendency. They very quickly started to make plans to watch movies together. I was invited to be a part of this but refused. I prefer to just stay at home babysitting Emily and Walter's daughter while they are in their cinephile reunions. Sometimes they go to movie theaters but other times they just stay at Walter's place watching stuf at his home cinema. They usually have to go to another town in order to catch a specific function of some weird movie so it is normal for them to come back very late. They eventually started doing stuff outside of watching movies, like going out for dinner. Walter invited all of us, including the kids, to go with him to a restaurant that a friend of him owned but I said no because it was too expensive. I don't like that kind of places because I feel they are a waste of money and didn't think the kids would enjoy it either. I insisted on staying with the kids and let the two of them go be themselves. This has became a regular thing and it is in a way a good deal for me because Walter pays for my wife's dinner and she can't no longer complain about me not taking her to fancy restaurants. As both their movie and dinner nights had became so common, I have grown a little tired of the burden of constantly babysitting the girls. I talk to my wife and Walter about it and he explained that he usually does not like leaving his duaghters with babysitters. He says he is really comfortable knowing that they are being watched by an experienced father like me instead of some teenage girl. He nevertheless agreed that it was too much of a load for me and offered to start paying me a standard babysitter fee each time he goes out with my wife. I thought that was a fair approach to the issue but my wife was fully against it. She says I should not be paid for babysitting my own daughter nor the daughters of a close friend of our family like Walter. We have been arguing about this but she insists on this notion and it not open to change. She even gets mad every time I talk to her about this. Walter promised me that he will convince her but he does not seem to have been able to do so either. Am I the Asshole?",

        "selftext": "My GF and I got take out from an Indian restaurant we like and order from usually when our budget allows us. This place is really the only good Indian place anywhere near us  but it is very pricey, and so we try to keep our order small (1 entree for me, 1 entree for her, and a side of naan bread that we share). The thing is, the side of bread isnt very much, and the entree just isnt the same without it. So it seriously annoys me when she eats the bread without dipping it in her curry. Its such a waste of the little bread that we get. I told her this before but says its not my concern how she eats her food. Except it is my concern because she is wasting a SHARED side. Whatever, I let it go each time.  This time she didnt order curry like she usually does, she got biryani (rice and meat) so I was happy that I would get the bread to myself. While we were eating, she reaches over for the bread and eats a piece on its own. I got annoyed and moved the bread away from her and told her she doesnt need the bread  since she isnt eating a curry and doesnt need bread whereas I am eating a curry so I do need bread, also that her entree comes with rice and she can eat that. She got offended and ended up threatening not to pay her share for the food next time. She also called me a greedy asshole and took her food and ate the rest in our bedroom. My friends are split, one of them says I'm in the right and it's too much carbs for one meal for her to have bread and rice, but the  other friend essentially also called me a greedy asshole. Its been hours and she's ignoring me. AITA?",

        "selftext": " My M30 brother in law M20 Sean moved in with me and his sister after my father in law passed away few months ago. He is the private type and keeps to himself. He goes out and never say where he's going or how long he'll be out, eats at random times during the day, wears earpuds while me and the kids are sitting with him. See, all of these are uncool behaviors and a bad influence on my children. I've already talked to Sean about certain house rules I have and how he was violating them maybe because he didn't but now he knows and still nothing's changed. Last night, he came home late at around 10pm. I wasn't thrilled with that because he knew the rules but he said that he was an adult and I shouldn't be policing him but it's not about that, it's about the fact that he's repeatedly disrespected the homeowner and the rules...So I told him this: If he won't respect the rules which are: Being home at 8, not eating at random times, and not using his electronics just like my kids aren't allowed when the family is gathered to spend time together. He ranted about how he wasn't a child, my child and called me unreasonable to treat him this way just because he lives under my roof, I told him it's not hard to show respect really but my wife went off asking what was wrong with me to be giving Sean who's still grieving, ultimatums and treating him like a child. I explained to her that I'm just making sure the kids won't be influenced by her brother's reckless behavior and she laughed asking if I think Sean being on his phone was reckless but that is besides the point. She called me a control freak and told me to get off her brother's back and leave him alone. I replied that she's just saying this because he's her brother but she said I overstepped and should back off and stop trying to control her adult brother. I asked her if she was happy with him coming home late and she said she was sick of arguing then went upstairs. AITA here?",

        "selftext": "I know the title sounds bad but please hear me out. This is my first year in college. Everything is working out fine EXCEPT for my roommate. Ever since I moved here I just can\u2019t stand him. Why? I can write a whole story about why I despise this person but I don\u2019t wanna keep this long so I will just mention the key points. 1. He is really messy. His room is a total mess (not that I sleep there but I don\u2019t have TV in my room and sometimes have to go to his room for it. NOTE that we are paying equal rent so he isn\u2019t doing me a favor for it).2. He used to not even wash his plates until I told him I am not washing for him.3. He would leave a mess everywhere until I had to explain to him like he is a little kid as to why it\u2019s not good to have a dirty house.4. Bathroom smells horrible whenever he leaves it. He can\u2019t even clean the toilet after use. Luckily though, I would rarely see him because I would spend most of my times at either the library, gym or with friends or my girlfriend after classes. Now though, because of what is happening, I must stay in the house which is killing me. I now have to work out and study at home. I like to jump the rope as a cardio exercise for 10-15 minutes which can make some noise. 2 days ago, while I was exercising he told me to stop jumping rope and find something else because I make too much noise. I got so pissed off because I never complain when he does things that bother me but now he can\u2019t even handle some noise for 10 minutes? I told him I won\u2019t stop so he just went back to his room. Yesterday though when I wanted to work out again I couldn\u2019t find my rope. I asked him if he has seen it and told me he HID IT from me and will give it back to me when he finishes studying as he can\u2019t concentrate. I got so pissed off because again IT\u2019S JUST 10-15 MINUTES, maybe 20 with breaks in between. I never complain when he bothers me but he can\u2019t even handle this. Because of this, I hid his laptop when he was out today. While I was working out, he asked me if I had seen his laptop and I told him I will give it to him after I finish working out. He said he has an online exam tomorrow and that he needs it now to revise but I refused to give it. I\u2019m physically stronger than him so he can\u2019t do me anything either. He just went back to his room. Well. When I finished working out he asked for the laptop back. I went outside to get it but I couldn\u2019t find it anymore. I think someone must have stolen it. I told him I couldn\u2019t find it and he told me that if I don\u2019t give his laptop back today he will press charges on me but he has no proof so I doubt it will work. He is blaming me for stealing his laptop but I just hid it because he tried imposing restrictions on me. I didn\u2019t know it will get stolen. Today I even caught him stalking me on social media. I called him out on this. AITA for this? Or did he go too far?  Edit: Stop discussing about court and stuff like that. That is none of your business. Simply judge the post please. Edit2: You guys are funny if you think this post counts as a reliable proof.  Again, stop discussing about law. Edit3: I will no longer be answering or reading any comments related to laws.",

        "selftext": "Hello reddit, my daughter is 2 weeks old. I have barely held her since she was born. My wife constantly has her. When I do get to hold her, my wife just starts crying hysterically until I give her back. I asked her why and she said she was anxious that something would happen to our daughter and that's why she felt the need to hold her so close.  No matter how much I tried to reassure her, she just wouldn't let up. I practically begged her just to let me hold her so that my wife could shower, eat, and care for herself but nothing worked. I felt like I was losing precious bonding time with my daughter so I did what I thought I had to do. My wife fell asleep on the sofa with our child, I took her, went to the guest bedroom and locked the door.  My wife woke up shortly after, very upset of course that our daughter wasn't with her. She soon realized I was in the guest room and begged me to open the door. She was crying, kicking, and screaming. I didn't open it though, and spent a good couple hours with our daughter in there.  Apparently my wife had called her mom, because I got a call from my mil cussing me out, saying how I shouldn't be taking a newborn from her postpartum mother and other things like that. My wife has been furious with me and won't speak and I'm just so frustrated because I really just wanted to spend quality time with my child but maybe that wasn't the way to do it. AITA?",

        "selftext": "I (40f) was a single mother to my daughter, Amy (15f). I came out 3 years ago and married my wife Jenna (42f) last year. She has a daughter, Nora (13f). We all live together as I have full custody of my daughter. It was kind of hard for her to adjust to having a second mom, but they got along well. The girls have their birthdays very close, only two days apart, so we decided to have a joint birthday party for both of them, since Nora had a hard time making new friends (they moved in with us and she's very shy). Most of my family lives out of the country, so the gifts were sent a week early. It was a huge bag, with at least 20 gifts. The party was nice and we opened the bag at night once everyone left. Jenna handed out the presents as she took them out. After 12 gifts in a row just for Amy, I checked the bag and froze to see that there was only one gift for Nora, from my parents. She pretended it wasn't a big deal, but as she opened the present I saw her eyes drop. It was a $15 tumbler from Walmart. Not to sound ungrateful, but Amy's gifts were much more expensive (lots of gift cards over $100, a new phone, limited-edition Funkos, designer clothes and lots of cards wishing her a happy birthday). Needless to say, I blew up the family chat, calling out my parents, siblings, and extended family who sent gifts for not considering Nora and my parents for the cheap gift. No one took me seriously since: *It's not our duty to give gifts to someone else's kid* and *Amy deserved them, since I didn't even throw her her own birthday party,* emphasizing that Jenna and Nora are my problem, not theirs. Nora was clearly hurt, since it's not the first time my family has left her out. At night, I asked Amy to share some of the gifts with her stepsister. Not all of them, just a couple of gift cards and some of the new clothes. Amy refused. This surprised me, since she never had a problem with sharing and even though she and Nora are not BFF's, they usually get along. After asking why, Amy started crying, saying that she never wanted a joint birthday party, and that I force her to share everything with Nora. They share a room for space and I make sure they're both invited to the same parties and sleepovers, so that Nora won't be left out. If they don't invite both of them, then either of them goes. Amy stated that she at least wanted her own gifts to be hers alone. I scolded her for being selfish with her stepsister, grounded her and took a couple of the presents to give to Nora. She turned them down because she didn't want problems with Amy and it felt like pity. Since then, Amy has been cold to all of us. I just wanted my two girls to be closer with the joint party and have the same things. AITA? Clarification: Jenna and I bought gifts for the girls (their own tablets), as well as their friends. Nora also received gifts from her extended family, but they sent for Amy as well.",

        "selftext": "I (20M) live in a flat with 5 others at university. There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem She always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit. So we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex). I have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening. I had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk. So I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does.  She keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''.  The guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat.  So the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole. I then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing else I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA? **To those saying that the other flatmates are all guys, that's NOT true. Aside from the bitch, there are two girls, and the rest guy.** **To the people telling me that I should have spoken nicely to her, I SAID IN THE FIRST FEW PARAGRAPHS I ALREADY DID THIS. Me and the other flatmates asked her nicely to stop on several occasions and she didn't follow through. What she did was say ''Okay'' and then continue to do the same shit. I'm writing this as a clarification for those comments.**",

He was suppose to go Wednesday , my wife\u2019s mother and father got in a car accident. They live in another state so we had to drive about 4 hours. My wife was a wreck and wasn\u2019t in the position to drive since we her dad was critical. He pulled through luckily.  We have two other kids 11 and 7. We can\u2019t leave them at home alone and we couldn\u2019t find a sitter to watch them on such short notice, we even tried our neighbors but he couldn\u2019t do it. So that left our 18 year old. He was pissed to put it mildly but did it. I told him we would make it up to him, and if he could ask if his friend could move it back a week. They couldn\u2019t sadly.  We were gone for two days, he pulled though. My wife stayed and I headed back, I payed him for watching the kids and went to talk to him about getting him on the trip. It was suppose to be two weeks and they should just be a state over. He blows up about ruining his trip and there is no point going even though it should still 12 days of the trip. He called up a jerk and lock himself in his room.  I need another opinion since this was emergency and he doesn\u2019t seem to care his grandparents almost passed.  Edit: Well he called his mom, let\u2019s say it didn\u2019t end well,  he did say basically said the same thing he said to me, wife had a breakdown on the phone with him, she sent him the injuries and pictures of grandpa/grandma. He finally came out of his room and told me he isn\u2019t going to go on the trip and the plan tickets aren\u2019t needed.  Talked to my wife, never heard her that mad. Son confirmed what happened, he started yelling at her the moment the call started and she lost her shit when he called her selfish. On good news grandpa has some feeling back in his legs which was a huge concern  For people saying we didn\u2019t have emergency plan we do, first my closest friend- vacation, main babysitter- not available, backup babysitter- not available, last resort grandparents- hospital.  We tried to find someone that why we even asked our neighbor which I have a good relationship with. This will be my last update, had a conversation with my son about everything. Mom and him will have a conversation when she is calms down. His friends are not a state over, they are about two down at this point and going to Mexico. They are probably will get to the boarder tonight, they were suppose to be going to California . He had his passport and everything ready. This is a fucking mess. I haven\u2019t informed my wife yet and will wait until she is calmer. I\u2019ll leave off with I hope none of you ever have to deal with a situation like this and please remember your parents are human",

His mom came to wait with me there but didn't speak to me because we have been having some minor disagreements. She offered me coffee but I declined politely.  Hours after the surgery, we were told only one person goes into the room for the day since he was still under anesthesia. From what I understand he woke up calling for his mom, the nurse asked for his mom to go in and she did. I was irritated and felt like all this waiting and stressing out got ignored. The nurse told me that he was still not fully awake and was repeatedly calling for his mom spontaneously, she was basically hinting that I shouldn't get worked up over a natural reaction from my husband but I couldn't help feel irked. I wanted to go home so I left 10 minutes later. His mom called saying she got out the room after I left so I could get time with him but instead I couldn't wait and went home. She said this was not okay and I flew off the handle for no reason, I said that her son acted like I wasn't there but she said that he can not be blamed for something he can't control and I'm just being unfair to him and putting blame on him because of a disagreement between her and I. I cut the conversation short after I sensed that she somehow blamed me for being unacknowledged and ignored. Her husband texted later saying I'm being hostile over nothing and that I should focus on my husband's health instead of acting petty but I don't think I did anything that qualifies as petty.",

He's made it clear he is just not interested in spending time with his nephew, keeps saying that the reason for that is that he's actually child free. for so many emergencies he has turned me and my wife away when we begged him to watch our son  and he didn't even budge or apologize for his attitude. it all came to head a couple of days ago, I had a work meeting while my wife was out of town and my inlaws were attending a wedding so no one was free to watch my son except for my BIL. I showed up to his place and told him I was desperate for help and needed him to just watch my son for 2 hours. he refused, even suggested I take him with me to work but that's not a good suggestion. I begged him and he just said no. I had enough I confronted him and asked why? does he not like his nephew and he threw that no it's just that I'm child free excuse which made me lose it. I told him to just stop because it's cringe of him to keep saying that and use it as an excuse to be unsupportive of me and his sister and cold towards his nephew. I told him he should really do better and stop being so negative but he got mad and said I had no right to disrespect his lifestyle/choices but it's the attitude that gets me. we had a exchange of words where he said my son isn't his responsibility whatsoever then I left. he complained to my inlaws and they called me out for disrespecting their son and treating him like that. They insisted that he's not responsible for my son and I shouldn't expect so much from him then guilt him about it. they wanted me to apologize and my wife said I should but he was about as helpful and supportive as a rock so, I decided I will take my time before I consider apologizing.

The only problem was during our ceremony, there were people on the sea playing or doing jet ski activities. It really bothered me because they would appear in the background so I told my wedding planner about it. She was very understanding and said she would fix it. When she talked to the owners of the activities and to the people in that area of the sea, we expected them to be kind and nice, but they just declined and continued. I even took the time to go myself and ask them to stop but they didn\u2019t care. I was about to go and tell someone from the hotel but my now husband stopped me and said it would be an AH thing to do. I told him standing up for myself wasn\u2019t an AH thing to do and went looking for hotel staff, but they said there was nothing they could do. When I returned my husband was moody and I wonder if it really was an AH thing to do. AITA?",

Their dad and I split up 6 years ago and I'm now (fixed it it was not but I meant now)married to my husband Kevin Problem is...Kevin thinks that my girls are not discipline simply because they don't follow everything he tells them because they don't see him as their father...We've already talked about that. Especially the part where he expects them to dress how he wants them to, and behave how he wants them too. He even called them weirdos but that's just how teenagers are and it's not a new thing. Anyways. I told him he needed to loosen up a little and lessen his expectations of them but I get it's hard to do given he was brought up in a conservative household with hard-core Christian family. Last week. He started a fight after seeing one of the girls' hairstyle and said that she was looking trashy. Because of the we had to cancel our trip to the mall because he refused to drive us. A couple of days ago. We wanted to go out for dinner. I was intending on getting off work at 6 but had some stuff to get done. My husband and I agreed that he'd take the girls and go to the restaurant and wait for me there. He called me before they got out of the house to complain about what the girls were wearing. The girls sent me pics and I thought nothing was wrong with their outfits and told him to drop it and just go. He said fine then muttered something about me enabling thrm then hung up. While I was still at work I got a call from one of the girls telling me their stepdad had them stand and wait outside the restaurant because he didnt want to be seen with them dressing like that. I was stunned I rushed to the restaurant and found them near the car. They explained he told them to wait in the car til he tell them to come in (basically wait for me) they started crying I had them get in my car then went inside the restaurant and found him on his phone. I went off on him and told him he should be ashamed of himself for treating my daughter's like if there was something to be ashamed of. He tried backpaddling saying it wasn't like that but I interrupted him then walked out after cancelling dinner. We went home and he came back hours later trying to argue that I can't blame him for disapproving of what the girls recklessness and that he tried communicating but I shut him down and treated him as less of a parent when he's just wanting what's best for them. He doesn't speak to me or the girls anymore.",

My 27 year old sister was visiting my mom's house for the week from out of town. My sister and I have never really got on, when I got pregnant she thought it was the worst thing ever, and insists that children ruin your life and thinks I force my daughter on my mom (despite my mom saying otherwise). So, when I went to drop my daughter off with my mother at around 11am like usual, I was shocked to find my sister there alone. I asked her where my mom was, and she said my mother had gone to the shop and would be home within a few minutes.  My sister has always been very dismissive of me, she hates talking to me and will do anything to shorten the conversation, which is why I think this happened. I huffed because I was catching the bus into town to go the doctors, and it left in a few minutes. My sister rolled her eyes. I asked her if there's any way she would have my daughter for a few minutes just until mom came back, she had just woken up from a nap (she always sleeps in her stroller) so she would be happy to just sit on the sofa and watch TV until mom came back. My sister said 'absolutely not, I hate children and I don't feel comfortable being alone with her'.  Now, I completely understood this and I think she was very clear in saying she didn't want to. I called mom on the doorstep and she said she was just leaving the store now, so she would be max five minutes. My sister rolled her eyes and said 'Fine, I'll take her', and she took the baby out of the stroller. I was in a rush and thought my sister would be able to cope for five minutes. I didn't even think it would be a matter of 'coping' because it was such a short amount of time and the kid was tired. So I left, and went for the bus. Literally five minutes later I get a call from my mom that they're taking my kid to the ER because she cracked her head open on the living room table. Apparently my sister had left the room for a couple minutes and my daughter wondered where she was going as she is never alone, so she tried to get off the sofa to follow her, and she slipped and whacked her head.  I am absolutely raging at my sister. I don't get how she could be so fucking stupid to leave a kid alone. She argues that I 'emotionally manipulated' her into babysitting, which I feel I didn't. She says she thought it would be fine to leave the kid while she made a cup of coffee, but I feel like it's common fucking sense not to leave a kid on their own for more than like two seconds.

She's out for a for days and my temptation got the best of me, so I ate the rest of an almost full packet. She has a habit of leaving food out to spoil, so I assumed it was all good to eat, but she sent me a message to make sure that there's some of the chocolate left for her. Fuck, it was already gone, so I've just rushed to the shop to get a new one in expectance that I'm a dead man when she gets back.  She once flipped out at me for eating her year old decorative pasta, so I'm not taking chances. Toblerone is replaced - with even more than there was previously. Not sure if I should put it in the Swiss packaging or apologize and just tell her that I bought I new one. For now I'm keeping quiet, like a parent discovering the dead goldfish and doing the ol' switcheroo. I'm in the UK btw, so the recipe is exactly the same as the one's in Switzerland. AITA?

        "selftext": "My husband and I have been trying for pregnancy for years now, and to cut a long story short it seems as though it will never be a possibility. It took a long time to come to terms with but we've gradually got there. Our entire family is aware of the journey we've been on and how much it meant to us. With that in mind, my husband and I came to his sister (Sarah) with a proposal. Sarah is in her early 30s, unmarried, and vocally against having children of her own. Despite this we thought she might be open to the idea of a surrogate pregnancy on our behalf given she would not have to be involved in raising the child personally. My husband is extremely close to his family and the idea of the entire process of surrogacy being contained to his blood felt extremely important to him. With that closeness in mind, we did not feel it was out of order to ask this sort of question. We invited Sarah over for dinner and at the end of it laid out our request. We told her we had been saving over the years and would be willing to pay her as much as a regular surrogate would be paid (a pretty hefty fee so she would be able to take time off from work if it was required), help her out with everything she needed, plus we had no expectations that she must help raise the child just because she carried it. We told her why it was important to us and how much it'd mean, and asked her to have an open mind about it. Sarah exploded at us. She said we were both out of our minds for making such a request, extremely selfish, and that we had no respect for her disinterest in children. She actually left early. Right now she's refusing to take calls from us and even went as far as to ask my husbands parents to tell us to both not contact her until she decides to initiate it herself. My husbands parents are sympathetic to us but say that we should have kept in mind Sarah's difficulties. My parents think she is behaving awfully. Most of my friends are on my side but a few have said that it was a bit of a rude request given everyone knows how much Sarah hates kids. It's really weighing on my mind and I honestly never expected this kind of outcome. She literally blocked us on every platform she could. Are we really the ones behaving like an asshole?",

She has been fostering this 8MO for a month now and it's been a week-by-week process with the judge and bio family while they sort out their lives/issues that causes them to lose custody. Although it appears they don't care, aren't showing up to court or meetings, failing exams, etc., so who knows where that will go. My daughter hopes to keep Foster Child.  I am planning our first professional family photo in decades and am buying customized matching shirts; when I asked to confirm the size of Bio Child, she asked me about Foster Child. I told her I didn't think to include her because she's Foster and therefore may be temporary and it may be weird to have her in a family photo. She said all grandchildren should be included. My thought process is, she isn't really her kid and therefore really isn't my grandchild. That would change if she were adopted, but she isn't yet.  She went off on me and hung up and I am sitting here feeling horrible. I did not mean I do not care for the child, she's wonderful, but I thought I had a clear thought process?  AITA? Edit: I do care about this child, I'm not trying to exclude her purposely or out of spite. I just feel weird including her in our photo when /legally/ she is someone else's child still. Final edit: I accept judgment and I commented on the person's comment that made me realize why I am in the wrong. They were to the point and just made it a simple question and I understood.  I feel the need to say that a large majority of my concern is precisely from a *legal standpoint*. I did not feel comfortable claiming this child as ours when, although her parents are being irresponsible, they are still claiming to want her back and have been in contact with the foster child's case managers (even if they're not doing what they should be as far as taking the right steps to getting custody back). Maybe I should have expanded on that in my original post; if so, I apologize.  Accusations of me not caring and neglecting the child or making her feel unwelcome were..a tad bit much. I am not a heartless monster who rejects anybody who is not blood - I'm an old lady who is confused on the customs and socially acceptable behavior of a new thing (foster system) in our lives and didn't know how to act or react.  My daughter and I called her case manager and the photo idea including FC has been shut down anyway (legalities of our state), so we are going to postpone to see if she ends up adopting FC or not to be able to include my new grandchild in the family portrait. Thanks to everyone who kindly explained to me why I was in the wrong. Another edit: I accept judgment as I said about my actions... but I stand by my matching flannel idea. You should try a cheesy matching shirt photo, they're goofy memories to look back on.",

She's a really pretty woman, but she does have a slight flaw to her physical appearance; she has a bad case of TMJ which makes it so that when she gives a big smile one side of her mouth curls up into a huge grin while the other side basically stays still. Every selfie we've taken together has her looking like this. While I absolutely accept that this is just a condition she has I wish she would do what she can to make it less noticeable. We've recently started talking about becoming engaged. Both of our sets of parents are ecstatic since they both apparently thought that grandkids weren't happening from either of us. But when the subject of engagement photos came up I told her that she should not smile quite so broadly so as to let her true, natural beauty shine through. She got really, really angry at this and said that the curled up lip on one side *is* her natural beauty, since it's her. She said that she isn't even sure if marrying me is a good idea. I'm the youngest of four kids in my family and the only boy. My father (71m) when he heard about his told me that it was no wonder that none of my relationships have worked out through all these years and that I need to apologize to her and beg her forgiveness.

She\u2019s very demanding as well.  My SIL\u2019s family members are very disrespectful and rude. They don\u2019t clean up after themselves, expect everyone to act like maids or servants around them and they think very highly of themselves. They can never be wrong and think they can do no wrong.  Because of this my SIL\u2019s family don\u2019t really punish their kids. Like they have no consequences. They aren\u2019t even like the gentle parenting type either.  My SIL\u2019s sister has a son and he\u2019s extremely chaotic. He throws tantrums if he doesn\u2019t get something and he has to be center of attention 24/7. When they\u2019re are birthdays he needs a gift or opens the gifts and needs to blow out candles. It\u2019s frustrating which is why I\u2019m not usually around at family gatherings and other stuff.  I was my SIL since her friend cancelled on her and I was helping make invitations. I saw one of the names were SIL\u2019s nephew. I asked if she wanted him to go and she said yeah. She then asked why. So I told her why.  I talked about his tantrums and how he\u2019ll probably throw a fit during the reception and other stuff. She got mad and said that she didn\u2019t know what i was talking about. She told my family and her sister which caused her sister to write me a message saying how I was wrong and other stuff like that.  Well day of the wedding comes. Everyone comes in happy except Nephew. He\u2019s crying and is about to throw a fit. When my SIL came out he literally started screaming. The poor Pastor had to stop and wait for the parents to leave.  During the after party he was back and again crying. When they were cutting the cake he screamed extremely loud he pushed my SIL who was holding a glass of wine and spilled on her. She started crying. She turned around to leave and I looked at her and said \u201cI told you so\u201d she started crying even more now.   When i got home my mom called me extremely immature and wants me to apologize. So, aita? Edit: When i went on facebook I saw a long post from SIL\u2019s sister. Basically saying that SIL knew how her nephew (9) was, and how if she didn\u2019t want him to throw a tantrum she should\u2019ve never invited them. She also called SIL selfish saying she should\u2019ve offered nephew to cut the cake with her. SIL\u2019s family also agreed and called SIL selfish. So i went over to SIL\u2019s house with a bottle wine. She told me i was right and how she should\u2019ve never invited them. I still apologized though because I did kick while she was down. I\u2019ve offered to pay to get her wedding dress cleaned but she said that it was fine.",

        "selftext": " My wife and I are expecting our first baby together, We made an appointment to find out the gender of the baby. To me, this is very important (I had hopes for a boy) unfortunately, the day of the dr appointment I had to attend my friend's birthday that I remembered last minute. I asked my wife if we could cancel the appointment and go another day but she looked shocked that I even considered canceling the appointment and going to my friend's birthday, I said I had no choice. She said canceling the dr appointment was off the table because these appointments are restricted to specific time and date and we can't miss it so she'll go alone. I told her no because that'd be selfish of her and besides this will ruin the news of finding out if the baby is a boy or a girl. She cut the discussion and told me to go to the birthday party. I did then later found out she didn't cancel the dr appointment and went with her mom. I came home seething and blew up at her. I started arguing with her about going behind my back and doing this without me. She said it wasn't her fault I prioritized a party over my child. I told her I didn't prioritize anything; she literally could've canceled and we would've went another day but clearly, she was trying to steer the fight to a direction where I look like the neglectful and irresponsible one. We fought some then she said I'm probably angry with her because it's a girl but I responded that she was wrong. She went outside the room claiming I was stressing her out. now acts like I owe her an apology on top of everything else but I feel upset and like I was decieved by her. AITA? INFO: first off ??? Jesus, I swear I came here thinking I was somewhat justified in my frustration but I was wrong it seems. Although I just wanna point out that I did not just go to the party without telling my wife and having a discussion with her first. Also the friend lives 2 hours away so I had to leave at 2 and the appoitment was at 4. I did not know she went and I would've appreciated it if she at least was upfront with me about what she did. She could've said she was going anyway but instead told me to go to the party and had me thinking she was going to cancel and reschedule. EDIT For those who are speculating on the type of parent I am/will be really don't know enough to make those assumptions so I'd appreciate it if you'd just focus on the conflict I just presented.",

        "selftext": "I have a son thats entering 8th grade and a daughter thats entering 9th grade.  Both of them have always been bookworms.  Very studious and cerebral, just like their Dad.  I also played sports all through school and I value the experience that brings.  I've always tried to push them to join sports, but neither one of my kids wanted to.  I tried to insist...maybe they would have fun?  We dont know til we try?  Even just to make them exercise and meet new friends.   My wife insisted I back off.  Fair enough.    Now my daughter is entering High School and wants to become a cheerleader.  She has never wanted to do anything even remotely close to cheerleading at any point in her life.  She actively made fun of cheerleaders 3 months ago.  But one of the popular girls moved in down the street last month and she has become a mainstay around my house.  She's convinced my daughter that she has to become a cheerleader in High School because she was a loser in middle school and you don't want that to happen in high school.  I said no.  I dont appreciate that reasoning.  My wife explained that I dont know what its like to be a girl in high school and I say OK?  Hows that relevant?  I also dont appreciate cheerleading.  Its too dangerous.  Girls get severely injured doing that, and for what reason?  We don't have the insurance to cover it.  Lastly, I dont like the sexualization of the whole thing.  Those outfits are a bit skimpy, and we're talking about high school girls.  My wife says I'm focusing on the bad and not the good.  Most girls dont get injured.  I'm the pervert because I'm making it sexual.  I pushed for her to join a sport.  I let my son play sports.  She'll have a much better high school experience.    I'm still like...fuck that shit.  My reasoning is sound.  She's not in it for the right reasons, and the benefits are lame.",

        "selftext": "I (25M) have a girlfriend (23F) who is absolutely beautiful, but she does have a large facial scar. My family often jokes about it, they have a super dark sense of humor. It bothers my girlfriend, and she says it doesn\u2019t feel like a joke, it feels like she\u2019s being insulted under the pretense of it being dark humor. Even though I explain it\u2019s just how they are and they don\u2019t mean any harm, she doesn\u2019t really want to be around them. I told her it was really important to me we spend Christmas with my family, we would all quarantine first and test but it was important to me. She resisted at first, but after some urging from me she gave in. She said I absolutely could not excuse their behavior if they made a rude comment about her though. We got there and it was fine for a while. Then my mom and sister broke out their matching ugly sweaters, that had my girlfriends face all over it. They both laughed, saying my mom made them (screen printed) and it was just a joke. My dad thought it was hilarious, I even chuckled a little because she\u2019s really beautiful, so it was ironic they put her on the \u201cugly\u201d sweater. My girlfriend looked at me, and when I said they were just being ironic, she shook her head, got up and left. Didn\u2019t say anything to anyone, just took her car and left.  I called her several times, and she didn\u2019t answer. The only text I received was \u201cYou need to find your own way home.\u201d That pissed me off, and I called her a couple more times. The whole time, my mom is upset because it was just a joke and she didn\u2019t realize my girlfriend was going to overreact like that. I told her that a warning would have been nice, but my sister agreed it was just a joke and my girlfriend was being a baby about it.  I had another fight with my girlfriend when I finally got home and she said I was an asshole for putting her in that situation and I said I didn\u2019t realize they were going to do that and they were being ironic because she was beautiful. She said I let them treat her badly and was trying to make it her fault when it was my family who was acting badly. I said it was just a joke and that she was overreacting. She asked how it was supposed to be a joke. I said that was just their sense of humor. I said I was sorry she was offended by the joke, but she ruined the whole day with her reaction. She said that no, them realizing she wasn\u2019t going to take their bullshit anymore ruined the day.  We aren\u2019t speaking currently, but when a cousin called to wish me a merry Christmas and asked how the day went I mentioned what happened and he straight up called me an asshole for doing that to her. I don\u2019t really think I\u2019ve done anything though, I didn\u2019t know they were going to do that, and really it was just a joke and I think she\u2019s overreacting, am I really TA here?",

        "selftext": "I (17m) have two sisters, Alice (29) and Miranda (33). I am much closer to Alice than I am to Miranda. Miranda is also not on good terms with our parents. Alice has four kids and is currently expecting child number five, while Miranda can\u2019t have children which her ex divorced her for. Miranda is very successful in life, she has a nice apartment, works a good job and earns a decent amount of money. Alice, on the other hand, is struggling financially. She had her first kid right out of high school and got pregnant with her second child soon after, so she decided to become a SAHM to her children while her boyfriend provides for them. Me and my parents try to help them out as much as possible, be it childcare or money, whatever she needs. I love my nieces and nephews. I take them to the park and play with the older ones, I really enjoy it. Miranda doesn\u2019t help out with them, she says it\u2019s because she\u2019s too busy. Well, she works long hours, but she doesn\u2019t have kids, so I don\u2019t know what she does on weekends. She also doesn\u2019t help out financially, which I find unfair, since she makes so much money and all she does is spend it on herself, although she does give us very nice gifts for Christmas and birthdays. My parents nag her about it, saying she should give some of her money to Alice monthly, and I agree with that. So, here comes the part where I may have been an asshole. I was at Miranda\u2019s place last week, as she baked muffins and invited me over to eat some and catch up. We got on the topic of Christmas presents and I told her some of the stuff I wanted. She nodded and said she would give our parents a coupon for a much needed vacation and Alice some clothes she had mentioned and also some new boots and jackets for her kids. I was a little stunned she didn\u2019t have more for Alice, so I asked, \u201cWhy do you only get Alice the bare minimum? You can afford to help out more and you refuse to out of spite.\u201d Miranda looked at me and laughed. She said it wasn\u2019t her business to feed six people, that Alice was old enough to make her choices and live with the consequences. She knew what she was getting herself into and that she wouldn\u2019t pay Alice\u2019s way through life just because she kept having children she couldn\u2019t afford. I was stunned at how cold she reacted. I asked her how she could live her life being so selfish and uncaring, and she got angry and told me, \u201cListen, kid, there are some thing you are way too young for to be discussing with me, and this is one of those. Drop the subject or get out.\u201d I got really frustrated with her and said something I probably shouldn\u2019t have. I told her, \u201cNo wonder your husband divorced you, even if you could have children, you would be a terrible mother.\u201d Miranda got very quiet and told me to leave and never come back. She has now blocked me on everything, and though I don\u2019t agree with her not helping out, I\u2019m starting to feel guilty for what I said. So, AITA?",

        "selftext": "I (33) get a call from the ER on Friday saying that my wife (32) drove herself there because of searing pelvic pain.  I\u2019m on a business trip until Saturday but I drive back in time to be there Saturday morning before she woke up.  A while after she wakes up, the doctor comes in. My wife says to stay with her so I say ok. He takes a deep breath and said that from the transvaginal ultrasound and CT scan results, she has ovarian cancer. My wife starts sobbing but at first I stay still because I don\u2019t even know what to make of it.  My wife asks what that means for her and he says that she\u2019ll likely at least need a full hysterectomy, and they\u2019d have to remove the Fallopian tubes as well as the ovaries.  That news jolted me from my chair. Because the doctor was effectively telling me that she wouldn\u2019t be able to have kids after this, and after years of work, I thought we\u2019d finally have a family. I\u2019m overwhelmed with emotions of anger, not just anger at the disease, but pent up anger form the fact that I had begged her to have kids since we were 26, but she refused for her career. And now instead of becoming a real family, I didn\u2019t even know if she would remain the woman I married, whether the last picture of us together would be last time I\u2019d remember her looking beautiful, young, and carefree. Because the wife I as in front of me was already a different person.  My wife started to grab my hand and say \u201c We\u2019ll fight this and we\u2019ll adopt.\u201d  But I shook my head and turned to walk out the door. I still had my suitcase in the car so I drove to a hotel because I didn\u2019t know if my wife was going to end up being discharged or what.  At the hotel I was at least able to get out of reactive mode, but I was still so disappointed  that our dream of a family was over.  I finally was able to get a grasp on all my emotions and feel more like my normal self in that I knew exactly what I felt about every aspect and how I would react to it from here on out.  I get a call from my MIL saying that if I was at a hotel or \u201c wherever else\u201d I should just stay there.  AITA for walking out? I admit it was done on impulse but this diagnosis just sliced my life and my wife\u2019s life wide open.  I wasn\u2019t going to expel the cancer if I stayed that night but I did at least make myself aware of my situation. And I feel I have a right to be angry that my hope of biological kids, the only kind I ever wanted, is rapidly fading away.",

        "selftext": "Ok so this is kind of a weird situation. My wife is one of those super prim and proper chicks. Like shes the walking definition of an 80s housewife. You don't ever catch her doing anything impolite, whether its burping or farting or shitting or any basic body function. Even weirder, when asked about it she completely denies she does any of these things. I've never managed to catch her, up until she had our daughter.  She had an emergency c section, and had a rough time recovering from it. She wasn't able to get up and walk by herself so I had to help her to the toilet and since shes so weird about needing privacy to pee, I'd just go to the other room and she'd call me when she was done.  Well she had been in there for a while, and I'm like oh she totally has to be shitting. So I went in there and sure enough she was. I teased her and was like, See! I knew you shit too! She got real embarrassed and told me to shut up and leave her alone and started to cry so I left to let her finish, but teased her about afterwards. She was real emotional so I shut up about it for a while. Well now some time has passed and shes no longer an emotional mess, so I figured I could finally tease her again. Every once in a while I'll casually bring it up, like we'll be talking about something and I'll be like still it wasn't as bad as that time you shit. Man that was awful, i could smell it from in here! She always gets mad and yells at me to shut up, which is hilarious. Well she broke down the other day and started yelling and sobbing when I brought it up saying that was a difficult time for her and shes still embarrased about it and she hates me making fun of her for it. I told her it's just funny because it's the only time I got to catch her doing it, and its harmless teasing and it's no big deal. But I kind of feel bad because she was really crying about it, and my friend said I was a jerk for making fun of something that happened right after giving birth. So AITA? I'm just trying to have fun and joke around with her. Edit: Welp, I did not expect this to blow up like it did. I guess the general consensus is that I am TA, so I guess I'll try to tone it down for now until she has more time to calm down over it.",

        "selftext": "I (54M) have two children (23F and 21M) with my wife (52F). When the kids were young, my parents set up education funds for both of them, which was very generous of them. My wife and I always expected our kids to attend college and then graduate school, as we have done. I have a PhD, my wife has a master's. Because of this, we decided not to use the funds for our kids' undergrad degrees and did not tell them about the money. My daughter has always been more into the liberal arts, while my son is more of a STEM guy. My wife and I worried about her ability to find a job, but she insisted on studying music and film in college. She was accepted to some top schools and chose to attend a rather expensive one, but she had scholarships to cover almost all of her tuition. Everything else, plus living expenses, was her responsibility. She lived in a very small apartment shared with friends in a not-so-nice area far from campus, but she was fine and learned how to budget effectively. After graduating, she luckily found a job that doesn't pay extremely well but she enjoys, and scrapped the idea of grad school. My son decided to do engineering, and he also expressed that he had no interest in grad school. My wife and I were disappointed, but accepted it since at this point he is already all set up with a very good job when he completes school. Since he did not receive as many scholarships as his sister, we decided to use his education fund to cover his tuition and living expenses. He was able to get a large and nice apartment of his own close to the school, which is important since his classes are so demanding and he needs a comfortable space to work. My daughter was confused and asked how he could afford this, and he told her about the education fund. She called us and asked why she didn't have one, and we told her she did, we just didn't use it because we hoped she would attend grad school. She seemed hurt by this and asked if there was any way she could have the money now. We explained that there would be a fee to simply withdraw the money for non-education uses, and if we chose to do that it would belong to her grandparents so they could put it towards their own use. She's been quiet and short when answering our texts, and hasn't answered our calls at all since then. I know that it seems unfair to her, but it's not really her money in the first place and she's no longer in college. Plus, her brother only received it for educational purposes and it wouldn't be right for her to just have it to spend now. AITA? UPDATE: I understand the consensus is that my wife and I are the AH. I texted my daughter to ask if she wanted us to withdraw the money for her/what she wanted to do. This was her response: I don't care. Maybe they can transfer it to [other grandkid who is 5] if the fee is seriously too much. Idk about grad school I haven't thought about it much recently. If I do apply it wouldn't be for another couple years and I hadn't been counting on having any financial help in the first place so it really doesn't even matter. Thanks for asking tho. UPDATE 2: My wife and I are discussing our daughter's response and our next actions to resolve this situation. For context, my wife has always had a strained relationship with my daughter and did not approve of many of her life choices. She believes we should take our daughter's words at face value and assume she no longer wants the money. From some of the responses here, I fear that my daughter's response was out of resentment and I suggested taking out as much money as her brother was given so at least they received the same amount. She could use it responsibly towards rent, groceries, transportation, etc. or in some other way to further her career, so it would still be for educational purposes in a sense. My wife is standing firm in her opinion, and we will continue talking it through tomorrow.  Many have asked about where my parents stand on this. At this point, they are not mentally aware enough to really participate in the discussion. They did know about our grad school stipulation and thought it was fine. They also knew that we took out some money for our son once we were certain he was not pursuing an advanced degree, and were fine with that as well. They said it was our decision as parents what to do with our daughter's fund, and they would support whatever we decided for her. It wouldn't be useful to ask them what to do with it now, but I have always said that whatever is unused will go back to their care. I have tried to call my daughter with no luck, which is why I sent the text. Despite what many have said here, I hope this does not end our relationship. ",

        "selftext": "I(24F) have been dating Jay(28M) for four months. He is handsome, smart, funny, well-educated, has an awesome job, and is a sweetheart. Sunday he had a whole day planned for us. We were going to walk a nature trail and then go back to his place for dinner he was making. I was so excited because it was going to be the first time I'd be at his house. Since we were hiking he said I could bring my dog Shelby with us. He made us a roast and some vegetables for dinner. I finished my plate before Jay did and took it to the kitchen. There was still about half the roast left and it was close to Shelby's dinner time so I took half of the half of roast and some still raw vegetables from the fridge to put on a plate for Shelby. I was carrying the plate to the back door with Shelby to feed her outside and Jay asked me what I was doing. I told him feeding Shelby. Jay said something like Well that's not dog food. Jay knows I mainly feed Shelby a raw diet. I opened the door to put the plate down for Shelby and Jay got up, took the plate away from her, went to the kitchen and came back with it wrapped up in tinfoil and told me to leave. His excuse was that he made dinner for me and him, not me, him, and my dog and that I should've asked before I helped myself since he would've used his leftovers. I did leave but not before telling him that he made that meal for us so I could do with some of it as I pleased and he knew damn well how I feed Shelby. I tried talking to my friend about it later that night but she said Jay was right to be upset but this friend has never really approved of how I treat my own dog so I feel like she was probably a bit biased and the wrong person to ask. AITA for just feeding my dog like I normally would? Clarification: She does NOT get restaurant food daily, I eat out maybe 4 times a month. If what I eat is dog safe or the restaurant makes food for dogs on request, THEN I bring some home for her. Shelby's daily meals are a bit of brown rice, raw vegetables, and ground chicken hearts and beef livers. The hearts and livers are boiled just enough to kill bacteria and that is all with the approval of Shelby's vet. I asked Jay how he prepared the roast so I could know if it was safe to give her. That's also why I got her fresh, unused vegetables from the fridge. Update: I accept that Im the AH for what I said and did to Jay. Some of these responses were harsh but I see now how and why I was entitled. Thanks to people that responded to the actual issue. Others going on about her diet, thanks for the concern? but I came here to ask about Jay. Not get into a debate about dog foods. Shelby's been on her diet for 6 years and is a healthy and active puppo, that's all I and my vet need to know. As for Jay, I apologized to him and he did accept my apology but he broke it off. He said it was the last straw for him over me doing things without asking first. He has talked to me about taking things off his plate or his drink without asking before. I've tried to do better but keep slipping up. I didn't realize I was that bad about it so I'm going to work on myself for the next guy. For people that said not going to his place for 4 months was a red flag, that was my decision that he respected. I don't want to go to someone's house or them know where I live the first few months of dating and getting to know each other.",

        "selftext": "Some background: My wife is a makeup artist, She always has those heavy makeup looks on which can be weird for me as guy sometimes, but she loves it and enjoys it so no problems there. though my friends and family tend to make funny, lighthearted comments on her makeup which she seems to take too seriously. Now the situation, My 27th birthday was few days ago. we celebrated at a small diner with my guy friends and my wife. now my guy friends are brutally honest and make jokes and tease all the time, my wife knows how they are so no surprises there. Anyways, My wife took a miute to use the toilet to get her makeup fixed as me and the boys were chatting. when she got back she asked me how she looked and before I could answer, My friend Austin responded by jokingly saying Damn, you look like you just got out of the cancer ward with that heavy makeup on your face!. the rest of the guys started laughing and I just stared at my wife. she got very upset and started arguing with Austin about how awful he was. others joined in and there was so much comotion. I felt upset that they were fighting during my birthday celebration. I asked my wife to calm down and take a seat but she asked if I was okay with my friends making fun of her. Austin said come on It was a joke! I threw my habds up and said that I admit that my wife overreacted because really it was a joke, She lashed out on me and took an uber home. The party was cut short and when I got home we began arguing. I told her she overreacted and that she shouldn't take everything seriously knowing how great she always looks but she turned it into an argument about how I let my friends insult her, and how I should've defended her and her integrity after I basically forced thise guys upon her when she was the ine who arranged for this enitre celebration. she kept crying about getting humiliated and me dismissing her feelings and saying she overreacted.",

        "selftext": "I am a makeup artist for the past 9 years. I charge $500 for bridal makeup, around 250 for bridesmaid etc makeup but for regular party makeup I charge around $150. So few weeks ago a lady had booked me for a party makeup on June 25th. She booked at 10am. I went there thinking I'd do a regular party makeup. I had agreed $150 with her. As I was there, there were some people coming over. I assume relatives. At some point it slips from a woman about the wedding and I realise the woman I'm doing the makeup on is the bride. I'm doing a bridal makeup charging for simple party makeup. I was completely pissed how she lied about the occasion but I kept doing my job. After we were finished. She gave me $150 and I notified her we are actually $350 short. She asked what I meant by that and I said that I did a bridal makeup. You're the bride. That's what I charge for bride's. She said we had agreed on a simpla party makeup and that I am basically ripping her off because I worked the same amount of time and used the same products as I'd use in a bridal makeup so the title of the event shouldn't matter. I told her she doesn't get to dictate how I form my prices. She then refused to pay me at all and called me a scammer and told me to get out. Before I left her mom threw $200 on my face and told me to get lost. I was telling what happened to my friends and they all sided with the bride and said that unless I used more expensive products and I did extra labor then I'm not justified in charging her more and since she requested party makeup I should just charge her that.

        "selftext": "I (24F) live with my girlfriend (25F) and a roommate (23F). We share a two bedroom apartment and have lived together for 2 years now. Up until now, we have gotten along pretty well. My roommate has an elderly cat. The cat is honestly kinda mean, she doesn\u2019t like me or my girlfriend and will run away if we try to pet her or pick her up. So we just avoid each other. My roommate asked if we had cats prior to moving in because she said her cat \u201cdoesn\u2019t like other cats.\u201d We did not have any pets at the time so it worked out. We did tell her that we might want one someday to which she said we would have to revisit the issue if it came up. Well, my girlfriend and I have gotten to a place where we really want a pet of our own. We saw a kitten at the shelter and just fell in love with him. We got the okay from our landlord and brought him home last week! His name is Banana Pudding! :) Our roommate is furious with us. She told us that we were aware that her cat doesn\u2019t like other cats. I told her honestly that it\u2019s unfair for us to have to tiptoe around her cat and that we were allowed to have our own pets as long as the landlord is okay with it (which he is). She couldn\u2019t expect us to never get a pet or to cater to her cat\u2019s needs 24/7. The conversation ended there.  Unfortunately things have escalated because her cat hisses and swats at Banana Pudding just for existing. She is honestly pretty aggressive which is a big issue imo. Our kitten is very friendly and sweet and causes no problems. We asked our roommate that she keep her cat in her bedroom since she\u2019s elderly and aggressive. She refused and hasn\u2019t been speaking to us. She says we are huge AHs and even got some mutual friends to take her side. I personally think that if her cat is so aggressive and uncomfortable, it\u2019s her responsibility to live alone. It\u2019s gotten so bad that my girlfriend is crying and considering taking the kitten back to the shelter. So here I am to get an outside perspective because idk what to think now. AITA? EDIT: So I am definitely the AH. The comments have really helped me to understand that my roommate\u2019s cat is just acting\u2026 well, like a cat! I am willing to admit I was ignorant and impulsive. I have never had a pet before and should have done more research before jumping into pet ownership. I plan to sincerely apologize to my roommate. She is willing to talk once she gets home from work. I am going to see if she\u2019s willing to try a proper introduction for both kitties and Banana Pudding will be staying in our room for the duration while her kitty will be able to roam. I am hopeful that things will work out and I want to thank everyone for being blunt and educating me. I was impulsive and inconsiderate, but my roommate is a great person and I think she will forgive us and be willing to try to make it work. EDIT #2: Roommate and I have talked. I apologized to her for being selfish, ignorant, and for putting her cat in an uncomfortable situation. She forgave me and said she\u2019d be happy to help do a proper introduction between the kitties. She said that if we do things slowly and carefully, her cat might be able to accept Banana Pudding. For now, our kitten will be staying in our room for the introduction process. She also taught me a little bit about cat body language and guys\u2026 her cat came and sat in my lap! She even purred! My roommate is a very kind and forgiving person and I\u2019m very thankful that she chose to forgive me after I was such a huge AH to her. She played with Banana Pudding and gave me some cat food recommendations. I think things are gonna work out. Thanks everyone for your advice and criticism!",

We have a five month old, she\u2019s home with the kid all day while I\u2019m at work and needed a break\u2014so I went with the baby. Works out well for everyone because she can nap, my parents get to spend time with their granddaughter, and I bring her home a doggie bag with dinner. On the way home, around 10pm, I made a left in a no left. It saves me about 10 minutes because otherwise you have to go all the way around this huge park and then there are a bunch of one-way streets. It\u2019s a no left there because in rush hour it gets clogged up, but this was late at night and the street was pretty quiet: turning left did not worsen traffic or put anyone in any danger. Of course there is a cop lurking and waiting, and I get pulled over. Here in Ontario, \u2018disobey a sign\u2019 is a $100 fine and 2 demerits (guess how I know\u2026). Baby was sleeping in her car seat in the back. So just as the cop was about to leave her car to walk up to mine, I just for a second turned the radio on fairly loud and on a static channel. Baby woke up and starting screaming. When I rolled down the window, the cop heard a screaming baby and sent me on my way. Baby was perfectly fine. I gave her the pacifier and as soon as the car started moving she fell back asleep. We\u2019re home now and she\u2019s asleep and perfectly fine in her crib. I felt kind of guilty about the whole situation so I moved $100 (what I would have paid for the ticket) into the kid\u2019s RESP (university fund). \u2018My wife was absolutely furious when she found out\u2019 is what I might say if I was a complete idiot and had told her.

Due to limited space, no children were invited to the wedding except the bride's young nieces and nephews.  My baby was 10 months old at the time and I wasn't comfortable leaving him alone in an unfamiliar place with a stranger, which was a babysitter that my other cousins hired for their own kids. So I decided to bring him to the wedding. I wrote on the RSVP that I was bringing him but he would be sitting on my lap and I would bring my own food for him. My cousin didn't say anything so I assumed that he was OK with it. My baby cried at the ceremony but I quickly took him out of the room. At the reception I had him with me the whole time in a body carrier. He didn't make much of a fuss and I thought everything was OK.  After the wedding my aunt (groom's mom) confronted me and told me that I was rude for bringing my baby without permission. I explained that I wrote on the RSVP what I was planning to do but my cousin didn't object. She said that my cousin and his bride had a problem with it but the bride didn't want to start any drama because she doesn't know me well.  My other cousin's baby was 7 months old at the time and my aunt said that he had no problem leaving his baby with the certified babysitter and I should of done the same. And some of my cousins were upset because they thought that the groom gave me special treatment by letting me bring my baby and making them leave their kids with a babysitter.

We are madly in love and ready to commit ourselves to each other fully.  My sister (26 F) has a problem with that though. She was supportive of my relationship with Derrick before we got engaged. When I sent her a text telling her we were engaged, she responded by saying \u201ccongratulations.\u201d But then when I saw her the week after that, she got all serious and said I should strongly consider the marriage.  She told me I was young and could meet people I loved more. That was offensive to me because I love Derrick more than anything, and she\u2019s basically saying my love isn\u2019t that important. She also told me that Derrick and I could date for longer before we got married. But we are already fully committed to each other, so we might as well get married and be recognized as soul mates in the eyes of the law.  Anyway, the conversation was so hurtful to me. I eventually asked her, very directly, \u201cdo you support me marrying Derrick?\u201d She said no. So I stood up, told her she shouldn\u2019t be at the wedding if she didn\u2019t want us to get married, and left. I haven\u2019t talked to her since, although she has texted me multiple times asking to talk.  Derrick and I were working on the wedding guest list yesterday, and we both agreed my sister should not come if she doesn\u2019t support us. So we are planning not to invite her. I mentioned this to my friend yesterday, and she pointed out that it may be a little rude of me not to invite her. So, AITA for not inviting my unsupportive sister to my wedding?",

        "selftext": "Throwaway because some of this made local news and I don't want it connecting back to me. I work in a place where we are not allowed to have personal electronics on us at all. No phones, no smart watches, no pagers. I've been working here for about 6 months so my wife knows this and understands that she should not try to contact me by my cell at work. Phones are dropped off in our lockers and I typically have mine on Do Not Disturb. Before this incident, my phone has never gone off in the locker before. Recently there was a pretty big fire at a secondary worksite that I do work at occasionally but that day I was working at the main building. Local news covered the fire before I found out about it because again no electronics, plus the work we do isolates us a bit so news travels pretty slowly. There were a few casualties, a lot of seriously injured folk.  My wife had been watching the news from home and started freaking out, I guess. She called me 20 freaking times, which (and I did not know this was possible) overrode my DND and my phone was ringing for a while in my locker. In the middle of my shift, I got called into my managers office and was chewed out (and written up) for my phone making so much noise. They told me to go take care of whatever it was making my phone go off before I went back to work. I won't lie...when I saw those 20 missed calls from my wife I was seriously pissed off. Like I said, she knows not to try to contact me directly and a citation hurt my chances of getting a raise or promotion. I called her back and she was sobbing and asking me if I was okay. I said of course I was okay and asked what the f*ck was wrong with her to call me so many times. She was still crying and started talking about the fire. After that I started half-yelling at her about all the reasons it was dumb of her to call me. When I got home she was super upset with me. I apologized for yelling but she refused to talk. She's been very chilly the past few days and sleeping in our daughter's room. I know it was not the best decision to yell at her but I still think my anger justified . 1) she knows I don't work in the secondary worksite very often. 2) she knows that I can't be contacted directly and she could have just called the office. 3) 20 calls is absolutely *insane*.

        "selftext": "My husband thinks I'm in the right, but my niece helped me make this post on here to see what other people think. I (52f) have three sons ages ranging from 13 to 20. My oldest son (20m) has a girlfriend (19f) that hands around our house a lot... It's a really small house and doesn't have a lot of space. She's a nice girl but gets on my nerves sometimes because she's always over. I really don't think she's right for my son, either. Our tapwater has a weird aftertaste so I order gallon water bottles and use them to refill a big glass bowl with a tap. It is not cheap to get water and other groceries delivered, so I tell my sons, husband, and the girlfriend to be courteous of the other people who live here and not use up the water, as it runs out fast in our big household. Yesterday, I caught her filling up her big metal water bottle with the jug water, and I calmly told her that other people live here, too, and she shouldn't hog the water all to herself. She was rather short with me and said something along the lines of: Actually, this water bottle is big enough to hold all the water someone should be drinking in a day. I'm not hogging water, I'm just trying to stay hydrated. I found her tone to be disrespectful and ordered her to leave. She scoffed and went back to my son's room. That's when I really got frustrated. I opened their door and told her she has to leave. My son got really angry with me and told me that my girlfriend didn't do anything wrong and why is it a crime for her to drink water? I explained that I order this water for our family to use, not leeches who hang around all day rent-free. My son's girlfriend got a little teary eyed and left the room and out the front door without saying anything. My son told me that I was a major asshole and should have just minded my business. I think she's just wasteful and a brat. AITA?  Edit: Thanks for all the comments. I have spoken to my son about the issue, and you all made me realize that it was deeper than just the water. I showed him this post and explained that it's not her, it's me. I think she reacted that way when I initially told her off for filling up the bottle because--and my son helped me realize this, too--I was never really nice to her to begin with, in the course of their three year relationship (in my defense, she only started hanging around our house a lot about six months ago because she got a license).  We called her on the phone this morning and I apologized for my reaction to the bottle. I explained I didn't mean to make her feel bad about the water--it really wasn't that big of a deal, and I feel silly for making it a big deal. She apologized for having an attitude and explained how she can feel a little defensive around me sometimes. I told her and my son that I will work on my attitude. My husband still thinks she was being disrespectful but I explained that I'm the reason she felt the need to act that way in the first place. It's not my choice who my son decided to date and I need to respect his choice. I think she is a sweet girl, and I feel horrible for the way I have been treating her. Again, thank you to everyone for making me realize my mistake. PS: I have looked into purchasing a Brita pitcher to see if that is more cost effective. My son's girlfriend now brings water from home--although I didn't tell her to do that.",

I had a traumatic birth with her and post natal depression so always struggled with bonding, and still do struggle connecting with her. She told me she wants lots of babies when she\u2019s older and then asked me how many I wanted when I was her age. I told her I didn\u2019t want any and that I didn\u2019t even want any when I had her. I know she\u2019s only 5 but she massively misinterpreted it and got upset. I comforted her and put her back to sleep.  In the morning she must\u2019ve told her father what had happened when he was making her breakfast as I woke up to my husband absolutely furious with me for traumatising our daughter and damaging her self esteem. I told him she\u2019d be fine but he kept shouting at me telling me I was an awful mother. I replied that it\u2019s hard being a good mother to kids you regret having. He asked if I was being serious and I said that I was being impulsive when I said that but that I didn\u2019t want them and he knew that. He left the room absolutely furious with me and took the kids to his parents house. AITA? UPDATE - Thankyou to all of you who messaged me with your support, and thankyou to those who told me to die, I considered it. My husband and kids have returned home and taking your advice, have told her that I may not have wanted kids but I want her and I love her. She\u2019s now happy in her room playing with her Barbies. I love my kids, and I\u2019m going to get help with my depression so I don\u2019t hurt them anymore",

She\u2019s been grouchy her whole pregnancy so her sister offered to plan her a gender reveal party.  The plan was that all the food and decorations would be blue or pink and in the end we\u2019d get one of those special sparklers that would light up in either blue or pink to reveal the gender.  We went to the doctor and got her to write the result in a folded piece of paper that we passed over to her sister without looking. So flash forward to the day of the party and the moment of truth comes and the sparkler turns out to be pink for a girl. I don\u2019t know what came over me but all I felt at that moment was very bitter disappointment. To be honest, all I was hoping for for baby #2 is to be able to toss a ball around with him and coach little league. Or watch him go on Boy Scouts camping trips.  I know my daughter is only five, but I\u2019ve already started to deal with the dramas of being a father of a girl and the thought of having to double up now on the neuroticism was harrowing. I grew up in a house with three older boys and one younger sister and I can\u2019t imagine seeing myself be outnumbered. My wife grabbed my arm as people were approaching us to say their congratulations and said I needed to look happier. At that moment I just snapped. I shook my head and walked out to my car ( we came separately) and drove to my sister\u2019s (21F) house. I start getting texts from my sister in law and my wife saying \u201c way to reenact\u201d their dad leaving their mom when they were 10 and 12.  I felt like that accusation was unfair and that I just needed some time alone. I didn\u2019t ask to be flabbergasted- it just happened.

I didn\u2019t know him that well but this year we\u2019ve gotten to know each other and have gotten close. He\u2019s my best bud and like an older brother to me in a lot of ways. My wife goes all out for my birthday parties and I love them. She\u2019s more of a stoic introvert so I thought it would be nice to throw her a surprise 30th birthday with just her and me and make it a special event. I wanted to make her a gift she would love. Jimmy\u2019s an incredible artist and for the past two months I\u2019ve been taking lessons from them. My wife was curious why I was spending so much time away from home with Jimmy but I made vague excuses because I couldn\u2019t tell her I was making a gift for her. She\u2019s made a couple comments but never seemed upset. I told her a week before her birthday that I had made plans with Jimmy. I have a job with flexible hours so it\u2019s not uncommon for me to do it.  She wasn\u2019t upset or anything. When her birthday came, it was all I could do not to say anything. When she left for work, I put my plan in action. I decorated the place. I brought out the cake. I learned from youtube and stored it at our friend\u2019s house. I got a dozen bouquets of flowers. I got her a few other gifts too.  She was supposed to come home at 5:30 but she didn\u2019t. I waited hours for her but she didn\u2019t come home. I called Jimmy and he said he hadn\u2019t seen her. I called her and she didn\u2019t pick up. I checked her location and she was at a restaurant. I went to the restaurant and she was there with her friends. They were eating a birthday cake and she had presents. I never met these friends of hers before. I think they\u2019re from her work.  She seemed sad. She wasn\u2019t smiling or energetic. I wanted to take her home and show her my gift so she would be happy. I came over to her and told her she had to come home. We grabbed her things and left. On the uber back, she didn\u2019t say anything. At home she started crying.  She has been sleeping on the couch and she avoids me. My wife hasn\u2019t talked to Jimmy either. I told my mom and she called me an asshole. I don\u2019t know why. AITA?",

I moved in with him after our marriage because the rent was super cheap. My parents recently came to me asking if they could park their RV at our home.I didn\u2019t see a problem with this. Our yards are really big and there is space.Because of city ordinance the RV has to be parked in the back yard. There was no RV gate in the fence. My husband went to his aunt and asked if we could install a rv gate? His aunt said no. My husband relayed the message to me and my parents seemed upset when I told them. 2 days ago. I came home from work and saw that my dad had a construction crew at our home and had removed part of the fence for the gate. There was a apple tree in the way. They couldn\u2019t fit the RV in the yard. My husband angry told my dad not to continue and that they needed to repair the fence.At this point I felt like it was pointless. The fence guys already built the columns for the gate. It would cost a lot more money to rebuild the fence. I told my dad to finish the job but make sure it was left super clean. That it looked nice. I planned on talking to the aunt later and explain what happened.What I didn\u2019t know was my dad told the guys to remove the tree. My husbands aunt came by and saw the tree cut down and started to cry. She has refused to talk to my dad or me. When my husband came home he found a 30 day notice on our door.Terminating our lease. He tried to call his aunt and she didn\u2019t answer the phone. He then called my MIL and she went to talk to our aunt.Later I got several messages calling me an A for cutting down the aunts late husbands tree. I had no idea he planted the tree. Now my husband and his whole family are really angry at me. I never told them to remove the tree. I feel like I am being thrown under the bus here. Am I the A here?",

She'd refuse to eat certain meals and mom would take it personally...which results in a series of arguments between them. As a compromise this year, My wife offered to bring her own food to thanksgiving dinner. I was stunned I asked if she thought this through and she looked at me confused. I told her about how weird it'd be for her to bring her own food especially when she woudln't be sharing it with anybody else, and told her to think about how mom will react. She'd get very offended and upset. My wife said that it's not her problem and that she was just trying to make it work by bringing her own meal. I told her again that mom might not like nor even allow this. She blew up at me asking if I want her to either eat food she doesn't like or go hungry. I suggested she give my mom's food a chance but she said it wasn't about my mom's cooking, she just doesn't like certain foods. We had an argument and I ended up telling she could stay home this thanksgiving and have whatever meal she likes. She got quiet then lashed out on me calling me insensitive and negative to say this to her. I repeatedly asked her to calm down but she couldn't stop ranting about how I was basically willing to exclude her from a major event. She started cold shouldering me about it while at the same time guilting me saying I'm treating her poorly after she offered the perfect compromise. Update: And so, my wife has decided to go spend thankgiving with her family (who by the way live HOURS away, so this means unnecesary travel expenses) instead and basically ditch me for a whole week. Y'all happy now? Though I appreciate some insightful comments on the situation. Some others?.....not so much especially with those assumptions claiming that my wife has allergies, SHE DOES NOT! Y'all get that from? But anyway. S'all good now I guess though I'm not too thrilled with her decision. I feel like she's doing it to spite me or get me to cave in.",

My daughter is seventeen years old. She turned seventeen in February. Since she was around ten, she has been complaining about her lips. She inherited her fathers thin lips. They are a great shape, but they are thin. She has been bullied for it for ages. She has come crying to me about it several times. I thought she would get over it as she got older, but she never has.  My daughter lives with her father and step mother full time because I travel for work. But when I am in town, she tends to stay with me for weeks at a time. We are very close. Two weeks ago she confided in me that she had been saving money for lip injections for two years now. She had a lot of money saved up. We had a heart to heart about it and I decided to go ahead and pay for her to get them from a good doctor. I signed the consent forms and we did it. She is very happy with them, she loves them. They have really balanced out her face.  When it was time for me to leave for work again, I took her back to her father\u2019s. He flipped it. He started yelling at both of us and claiming that we destroyed her face. I apologized to him for not clearing it with him, but it was because I knew that he would say no. This was something she has really wanted for a long time. He argues that she is a child and doesn\u2019t know what she wants. Of course he has spread the news of the lip injections to several family members. They think that it is shameful that I would take my daughter to get plastic surgery and are urging him to limit my visitation (probably not going to happen). I think that they just do not empathize with my daughter and are excited to shame me for letting her get the most minor plastic surgery. She would have gotten it herself anyway, I just wanted to make sure it was done correctly. AITA?",

        "selftext": "Hi all.  Me, my husband and our 15 year old daughter Georgia went to my sister's place for lunch this weekend.  Georgia is very bright. She completed her exams early and is now studying more advanced material. She's a big fashionista, a lot more than I was at that age. She loves pretty clothes and outfits, and we're happy to get her as much as we can, provided she behaves well and keeps up the good grades.  The lunch with my sister was fairly casual, but Georgia wore her new pink dress. My sister isn't as well off as we are unfortunately. She is raising three children on her own and her job isn't a high paying one. In the past, she asked me if Georgia could tone down her outfits when we come to visit, because she doesn't want her kids being upset because they can't afford things like that.  I do get my sister's point but it's not down to me to police what Georgia wears. I have spoken to Georgia about it but I left the final decision to her.  Anyway so we went for lunch, and Georgia ended up getting into an argument when my sister's 13 year old, Lucy, asked about the dress and where it was from. Georgia answered that it didn't matter because Lucy couldn't afford it anyway. We told Georgia to shut up as soon as the comment left her lips, but it soon ended up with Georgia and Lucy screaming at each other.  My sister made the kids vanilla milkshakes, and Lucy decided to throw hers all over Georgia, ruining the dress. Georgia burst into tears and to be fair my sister did bring her a change of clothes. I said that if the dress was permanently ruined, I wanted my sister to reimburse us.   My sister has refused and said that it was our responsibility because my daughter wore an expensive dress despite being warned not to. That dress cost a couple of hundred, and washing it has failed to completely remove the stains. Frankly, I don't care about my sister's warnings. We can't make Georgia wear what she doesn't want to, and it's not our problem that she can't control her child and stop her ruining a beautiful dress.  AITA?",

Their reasoning is that my sister sacrificed her childhood for our family so its only fair she gets compensated. In our childhood, my father's business partner screwed him over so there was a period where we were broke and in debt. My parents had to work multiple jobs to keep us afloat, and my sister babysat us while our parents worked. All she had to do was feed us and keep an eye on us. We were pretty calm kids so all we did was play games and do our homework. It probably wasn't thrilling, but not exactly a tremendous hardship.

When my DIL was pregnant, I suggested that I host a welcoming party for my grandson right after she get discharged from the hospital. I've made arrangements and even emptied a room for them to stay but for some reason, she was against it and said she'd rather spend the first few weeks at home with her newborn. not only that but she said no to the welcoming party. My husband and I talked to my son and he said we'll see. But just a couple a days ago, We found out that my daughter in law had given birth 2 weeks ago and no one knew about it. My nephew told me and I immediately called my son, he confirmed it. he and his wife lied then hid the date of birth from the family. I told him this was not acceptable, lying just because they didn't want a welcoming party and love and support being given from family. I told him I was disappointed because for one...he ruined our welcoming for our grandbaby and also, I invited family members and they're all rightfully disappointed as well. He said it was his last resort after I kept pushing and made his wife uncomfortable but that was not appreciated because.. we were just trying to celebrate the new family member in a proper manner. We had an argument and he ended the call upon saying I ruined his joy for his newborn. My husband started texting him since he stopped replying to our phonecalls and now is threatening to block my nephew for tattling but I think that my nephew was decent enough to inform the family. otherwise God knows how long my son and his wife were going to hide their son just to keep us at arms length. We've always been kind and welcoming to my daughter in law and ger family, I don't why she would do this and disrespect the family like that. on the other hand, some family members see it as a justified action because we insisted on the party. Ps: Some folks, I'd appreciate it if you leave my nephew (m24) out of this conflict because he's not part of it.",

I do relatively drink a lot, but only in social settings.  I spent the rest of weekend in the hospital recovering. It was a one time stupid mistake.  Yesterday, I went over to my parent\u2019s house for dinner.  When I walked in, they were all sitting in the living room with somebody I\u2019d never seen before. I asked what was going on and my brother told me to sit down. I did and the man I didn\u2019t know started talking.  To summarize, he said that my family was worried for me and wanted me to go to treatment. I got upset and said that everyone was being over dramatic and that this was ridiculous. I said that I realized that I had made a mistake drinking that much but this was overkill. I stood up and walked out at that point.  My mom ran out after me with the interventionist and said that they only did this because they loved me.  I said that everyone was acting crazy and I hopped in my car and went home.  My brother has been texting me begging me to reconsider but I haven\u2019t answered.  Everyone is crazy overreacting. Getting that drunk is not a normal thing for me. It just happened once and I regret it. I have a good job and I look after myself. I don\u2019t think I need rehab or that intervention.  That said, maybe I did handle the intervention the wrong way. I maybe could\u2019ve responded in a way that made them feel better instead of blowing up.  AITA for walking out?",

        "selftext": " My wedding was days ago. My brother attended but his wife didn't. She was nearing her due date to give birth and she didn't come. The wedding was going well. Til my brother recieved a call from his mil telling him that sil was in labor. He told me he was leaving and my wife and I were fine with that but the issue began after he had told one of the guests that sil was in labor. Word spread out and suddenly, everybody was talking about it which disrupted the event. Even my parents started calling and there was a huge fuss which frankly, was unnecessary if my brother just left in silence or made up some excuse. I contacted him later and expressed my grief and frustration with what he did. I told him how the news of his wife being in labor disrupted the wedding and caused my wife to feel like her day was ruined. He lashed out asking how any of that was his fault. I explained how he should've just left or made up some excuse to leave but he said he didn't mean any harm and that he was in a hurry and worried at the time. He said it wasn't like he announced it and told me I disrespected him by arguing with him about it. We had a big argument and our parents sided with him and told me to 'get over myself' and are now expecting me to apologize. Edit// I just came back and started reading the comments. First comment I appreciate the sarcasm but in all seriousness, I did not expect people to come against me in this matter. I do accept my judgement but still am taken aback a little.",

        "selftext": "I am getting married in a few weeks and have my bridal party primed and ready, but had a huge disagreement with one of them yesterday.  Her name is Tara, and she is stunning. She's legit the prettiest out of our entire group. Absolutely gorgeous. However, there is one issue. Tara has terrible vision. She needs very strong glasses and even with them on her eyesight is bad. She gets the lenses thinned down as much as possible and even then they are so thick you can't see her eyes behind them. Her eyes can't tolerate contacts. In our ''bridal meeting'' yesterday, I asked if it was possible for Tara to take off her glasses during the main photos. I wasn't saying this to be cruel. I'd never ask her to take them off during the wedding party and walk around blind, but I'm just asking her to take them off during photos. Without those glasses she's absolutely breathtakingly beautiful, way more than me, but with them on her eyes look weird and distorted and would take all the attention away in the photos for all the wrong reasons. I brought this up with her but she got really huffy and sulky, told me to try on her glasses so I could see what she would be seeing during the photos if she took them off. I did and it was horrible, but I could stomach it for a few minutes to help out a friend and think she's being really unreasonable. She left early and the rest of the bridal party got at me for asking something so ''horrible''. I don't think it's an unreasonable thing to ask. I'm doing her a favour. Without the glasses she'll easily be the hottest bridesmaid so I would have thought she'd be OK with it.",

I threatened him to tell her and her husband but he lashed out saying that this has nothing to do with me and that I was out of line to get myself involved.

        "selftext": "So my wife has a friend from childhood named Anthony. I'm being completely honest here when I say that he and I don't get along. It's not like he is rude or disrespectful (nothing like that) but all I feel towards him is annoyance sort of speak because of how much my wife sees him. He lives alone and now suffers from a medical condition (Cancer) that requires him to go to the hospital regularly to receive treatment. I found out that my wife promised him to go with him to his every chemo treatment as support. She said it's a commitment she made to be there for him during this rough time since he has no one else besides him. Okay.....I had no issue with that at first but then this started affecting me. e.g, I can't go see my friends because I have to stay with my son on X day so my wife could be with Anthony for his treatment etc etc. I've talked to her about it but she said that Anthony needs company and that she's just being supportive and this is when he needs her the most. I let it go but last week was just kind of my last straw. Anthony had a other chemo session treatment and my wife wanted to go with him and asked me to stay home with our son. I told her I had a meet up with my mom and sister to eat lunch and that I won't be home, She said she needed to go be with him and I kind of flipped out at her and said that she doesn't need to be with him and could literally go see him at home the next day or something. She threw a fit and called me cruel for forcing her to leave Anthony by himself since she's all he has and that I was making her look bad. She also said my appointment with mom and sister wasn't as important as a chemo session but I decided to just leave to end the argument. She ended up staying at home but kept ignoring me when I got back calling me selfish for not letting her be there to support Anthony with what he's going through. Some of her girlfriends think I'm being a controlling jerk with no consideration for Anthony and what's he's going through. AITA?",

        "selftext": "My(25M) girl Lydia(23F), lives with a roommate who has a boyfriend, Jeff. We gathered at their place last friday for pizza. After a while Jeff asks Lydia if she is still scared of being here alone the nights the roommate goes over to his place and I can't come. Lydia has always had trouble with being alone at night and most nights I stay on facetime with her till she falls asleep so she feels safer. The roommate laughs and says that if she hears a noise in the bathroom at least it will be a ghost and not her locked in passed out. Lydia just mouths explain later to me. When we get to Lydia's room I ask her to explain and she tells me that this afternoon she wasn't feeling good and ended up fainting in the shower, so Jeff had to break to door to roommate get in and help her. She said that she already felt better and didn't wanted to tell me because I was going to be worried about nothing. I said that it wasn't nothing if she had fainted and that I should be aware of these things to help her. She said that now it would be just a funny story about how Jeff broke the door and roommate had to cover her with a towel so they could come to the rescue of her naked body. That moment I saw red. I asked if Jeff had seen her naked and she said she couldn't be sure since she was unconscious but roommate said that he stood out of the bathroom until she was covered. I asked if Lydia thought it was fair to me not to know that another guy had seen her naked and she said he didn't actually saw her naked and that it shouldn't matter since he was only helping. I shouted that she just said that she was unconscious and couldn't know if he saw her. She told me to be quiet or they would hear me and I shouted that I didn't care, that a man just saw my gf body's and I had a right to be mad. Jeff and roommate come in then and explain that he never saw anything, he just broke the lock and waited outside until roommate gave him a clear. I said that I didn't believe him and roommate jumped to his defense saying she was right there making sure the situation wasn't embarrassing so they could take proper care of Lydia without her felling weird. I said that if she was a cuckold I wouldn't be. Jeff then shouted at me saying I should respect his girlfriend and mine, who had spent a whole day saying that she was fine but still looked a bit pale. He said that he only did it because he cared about Lydia, that I was an asshole who didn't deserve any type of help. Hearing him say he cared about her was it for me, I left without as much as looking at Lydia as she begged not to go. Over the weekend Lydia had to be admitted to a hospital as she didn't felt good again and Jeff and roommate prohibited me from seeing her, saying I didn't deserve her. Obviously the whole hospital thing sucks and I wish I was there for her but I still think I was right. At this point I'm not mad at Lydia anymore, just at Jeff. EDIT: They agreed to let me see Lydia upon her asking them to. She said it would be best for us to be away from each other for a while. She is feeling better and for what I heard she is anemic among other things but going home this week.",

My wife (F33) is a big nerd, which I normally appreciate, but she is taking things way too far today. She took today off of work, so she could be up at 4AM to play her online game at launch. I didn\u2019t wake up until about an hour ago (10:30, and she was still playing. I mentioned that I wasHungry, hoping we could make breakfast together , which we like to do together. She instead said that I should \u201corder us something from doordash, im in the middle of a dungeon and may be a while.\u201d I didn\u2019t really wanna get takeout, because we had already discussed ordering pizza tonight for dinner, and that\u2019s a lot of take out food in one day. I calmly explained this, and she got pissed and shrieked at me that she just wanted one weekend to focus on her video game. I said that it was unfair to our family for her to isolate all weekend, and she got even more mad, telling me that I have two hands and can feed the goddamn cat. I was in tears at this point, and I did raise my voice and said that I was worried she\u2019s obsessed with this game and maybe she needs professional help. She threw her car keys at me and said that I need to get out of her face, that she\u2019s works all the time and doesn\u2019t ask for much, and I need to leave her be and get out of her face for a few hours. I am truly concerned that she has become obsessed with this online game, and I\u2019m hoping that maybe reading this thread will wake her up to it, but I might\u2019ve been the AH too. Edit: some additional info I forgot: ir isn\u2019t just today, for the last few weeks she\u2019s been hyping herself up for this. When the game got delayed, she MOVED HER VACATION time rather than just keep her previous day off and spend it with me. She\u2019s been absolutely freaking out about this game and I don\u2019t understand it and it scares me.",

I asked wtf was his problem and he looked at me with and with a straight face said IF YOU'RE GONNA COME OVER HERE AND USE WATER, ELECTRICITY AND WHATNOT 5 DAYS A WEEK THEN YOU MIGHT AS WELL START PAYING RENT!. I responded telling him that my bf pays rent and I use what he uses then called him rude and told him to get over himself. He told me he'll get the landlord involved and my bf asked me to leave so he could figure it out with the guy. I grabbed my stuff and left feeling awful. My bf later called saying I was rude in what I said and his roommate has a point especailly since I'm using everything in the apartment from microwave, shower, charger and so his roommate felt it was unfair and my bf asked me to tune down my visits for now.

With my oldest sister\u2019s work schedule the only time we can go for the foreseeable future is the 29th. This has been planned for several weeks. Bindi announced to me this week that her school is doing a Halloween dance on the 29th. She was so excited and was excitedly planning her costume, I hated to burst her bubble but I had to tell her she can\u2019t go. You see, Fritz is severely autistic (exactly what you\u2019re probably thinking, he\u2019s nonverbal, no eye contact, no toilet training, that sort of thing). This makes him much more difficult to leave with someone than his sisters ever were \u2013 I could easily find a sitter for them when they were younger. The only people who will even take Fritz outside our household are his grandparents, who cannot watch him that weekend. He also does well with Bindi, meaning she is literally our only option. Bindi didn\u2019t take it well and asked me why Ava can\u2019t watch him for a few hours while she\u2019s at the dance, since Ava has babysat before. Well, Ava is having surgery the Monday before that, nothing major but she is not going to be healed up enough to deal with one of her brother\u2019s meltdowns by Friday. (I\u2019m not saying that would happen but it\u2019s always a possibility with him). She can help but someone else needs to be there and that someone else is going to have to be Bindi. She responded by saying she \u201cdidn\u2019t realize her siblings were so much more important\u201d and went up to her room scowling. I\u2019ve tried knocking and calling her, but she keeps sending me straight to voicemail. I get that she\u2019s upset and was really looking forward to this dance (it\u2019s only for juniors and seniors and school didn\u2019t have it last year thanks to COVID), but I\u2019m going to need her to make a small sacrifice for the family right now. I fully intend to make it up to her. But does expecting her to be there for family make me TA?

I don't think my girlfriend was thrilled but she didn't say anything and agreed. She has seen them before and I don't think she really likes them very much but she knows I love them so she doesn't really say anything besides they aren't really her thing.  But I really wanted to make a day of watching them and I went over to her house because she has a really big comfortable couch.  About ten minutes into the first movie and I look over and she is browsing on her phone. I was a little miffed but didn't say anything. She basically scrolled through her phone the entire movie. When we started the second movie, she opened a bottle of wine and proceeded to drink the whole thing, while still sitting on her phone. I was pretty irritated at this point because she wasn't even paying attention at all.  The third movie started and by then she had opened another bottle of wine and was asleep within the first twenty minutes. I was really mad at that point and just left and went home.  A few hours later I got a text asking where I went. I told her I was mad that she couldn't pay attention to my favorite movies on my birthday. She told me I was an asshole and to grow the hell up. I've texted her a couple times but she hasn't responded. AITA? Edit: This has really blown up and I've gotten a little overwhelmed, but I do accept that I was the asshole. Watching 9 hours of movies that she hates was definitely too much of an ask and I shouldn't have reacted the way I did. I just took it personally because I felt like she didn't even try and these movies are important to me. The fact that she isn't much of a drinker and drank this much kind of set me off. I called and left her a voicemail apologizing.",

        "selftext": "My son is 8 years old and recently attended his friend's 8th birthday party. This friend is my best friend's son. I don't let my son have any/much junk food at all and usually he brings his own snacks (for this incident it was carrot sticks and ranch) to events that have a lot of sugary foods. My best friend bakes a lot, and made a special chocolate cake for her son's birthday. When it comes to my son, I don't let him have cake. This is personal preference for his health, not for any allergy reasons, and he is not diabetic or gluten free. My son knows he isn't allowed to have cake because of the additives. When he told his best friend this at the party, his friend apparently got upset and told him it was good cake, not bad like I say, because his mom made it, and it was his birthday cake. My son ate cake, got a sugar rush, and crashed, making him cranky for the rest of the day after we left the party.  I told my friend she needs to have some kind of consequences for her son to teach him not to peer pressure other children into eating things they're not allowed to have. She said because it wasn't an issue of allergies or health, that she's sorry my son was cranky but she won't be punishing her son or talking to him about it on his birthday. She says also that she'll just that she'll watch more closely/make sure her husband does in the future, as well as have a chat with him on another day about respecting food habits. (I love my friend, but historically, her and her husband have always said 'yes' to their son and not given him any consequences for anything.) Both of us were present at the party and did not see them sharing the cake (they were outside eating in the backyard with their fathers and some other parents supervising while we cleaned up) so it's not an issue of anyone going behind anyone's back, just teaching children boundaries and respect.  I let my son stay for the rest of the party and be with his friend, so it's not like I ruined the day.

I was a little shocked because I like to think I'm nice enough and get along with people, but I was keen to find out what her issue was with me. You don't say good-bye, you just leave is what she said, and it's true. I prefer to just leave a party and let everyone keep going. I do it because if I announce I am leaving then people often ask me to stay or ask why I'm leaving, sometimes it makes other people think yeah I might go too ending the party earlier. I prefer to just disappear.  Anyway I explained myself to this friend and she said no it's super rude. We're Australian so I told her to go fuck herself and we both laughed. After that BBQ I made a point of saying goodbye to her directly, but I still prefer to ghost. My wife isn't a fan of me doing this but she has long since accepted it. tl;dr - I like to leave parties without saying goodbye to most people (please read the edits, I do thank the host and I now know it's an Irish goodbye). Am I the asshole? Edit: I should note that I do try to tell the host I am leaving (if I can get them alone without causing a scene by saying good-bye) and if not I text them to say thanks. It's just everyone else I'm trying to avoid. Edit 2: she was not the host of this BBQ, it was my in-laws bbq and she was a neighbour that was invited. I ghosted that event late into the night because my house is a few hundred metres down the road and I was 15 shades of fucked up. Edit 3: fmd my inbox is nuked Edit 4: TIL that this is called an Irish goodbye. Thanks for all of the support from fellow Irish goodbyers. Too all the people that think I'm rude, I accept that with open arms and will try tailor my approach a little differently moving forward",

We have a great time together and generally get along very well. The only thing is her choice in home \u2018decor\u2019 is bizarre, to put it frankly, and not something you think a normal, grown adult would be into.  Her apartment is definitely a reflection of herself and interests. Not in the best way though.  My girlfriend has wall dedicated to animation in one room of her apartment, like Futurama pieces and etchings of some weird triangle guy. Then there\u2019s the wall of framed preserved insects in another room. But not insects like butterflies or moths. Instead she displays tarantulas, beetles, and large stick insects. Her bathroom has a subtle theme of the ocean-pretty common. But instead of starfish or shells, she has a little anglerfish nightlight, a small vampiric squid painting, and then a framed diagram of what apparently is a Goblin Shark right by the toilet.  I would say a majority of her home decor and furnishings are okay. The apartment itself is very modern and sleek. It\u2019s just the random decor and juvenile-ish themes like cartoons, insects, and bizarre ocean creatures, is off putting. This is where I might be the AH. I avoid bringing people over to her place, especially people from my job, because of how juvenile it looks. Everyone\u2019s impressed when they see the high rise, but that quickly fades once you enter. The one time I brought a work colleague over they ended up telling me after that they found her insect wall terrifying. I work in finance and appearances and first impressions are important. My office will hold casual gatherings where we get together for a few drinks, good food, and we rotate hosts. And this time, it\u2019s my turn. The problem is my place is under some construction and not an ideal place to be right now, so I\u2019ve been staying with my girlfriend. My girlfriend suggested that we host my colleagues here since she has the space and thinks it\u2019ll be fun. I told her I planned on skipping my rotation and seeing if the next person would be okay with hosting early. She kept pressing on why I didn\u2019t want them over here, so I finally said it\u2019s because her home decor is strange and not something a grown woman would have, and also that her insect wall horrified the one colleague that did come over.  My girlfriend got mad and said at the end of the day, it\u2019s not my space and these things bring her joy. She also said that she is indeed an adult woman, which is exactly why her apartment is decorated in such a manner.  I love my girlfriend, I do. And it\u2019s okay to have different interests. But does an adult really need to decorate with them besides a few things here and there? I mean, my own mother asked if my girlfriend was autistic after she saw the entire apartment for the first time. So Reddit, AITA for telling my girlfriend her home decor is the reason I won\u2019t host a work gathering at her place?",

She had previously lived with her mother but I got default custody after her mother turned one of her 24 hour disappearing acts into a never coming back one. My daughter and stepson go to the same middle school and were both running for student council VP.  There was tension in the house and my wife told my stepson that if he won we could go out to celebrate. My daughter asked if this applied to her as well since he wasn\u2019t her only competitor and my wife said of course. The campaign got pretty stressful for the both of them. Then the votes come in and my daughter wins by 4 votes. However, because somehow the one person who ran for treasurer this year dropped out because of grades, my stepson was offered that position.  He saw it as a really pitiful consolation prize and was angry that he had to take orders from my daughter. I felt very bad for my stepson and he and his mother (who is also very Type A), was very upset, even though of course my wife congratulated my daughter. My stepson refused to be comforted by the fact that older kids get more easily elected because they know more people and his mother even offered to take her to her law office and give him some responsibilities, saying that was better experience than student council would ever be.  My stepson then said \u201c please tell me you\u2019re not going to rub it in my face by taking us to dinner now.\u201d My wife also looks really reluctant to go to dinner.  I finally tell my daughter that we weren\u2019t going to be going to dinner because her stepbrother was very upset by the turn of events and we need to take his feelings into consideration. And that I was impolite to gloat. That all happened Friday. My daughter ended up crying and even now, Sunday night, she still is mad at all of us. AITA?",

        "selftext": " I'll preface this by saying that I (M35) am a widower with 2 kids (9, 11). I recently got back to work and since I work nightshifts, I had to get the kids a babysitter (they're at school during the day and my sister stays with them) I was able to find a babysitter with the help of a co worker (actually they're related) and things have been going pretty well except for few days ago. The babysitter called me while I was at work to tell me that my 9 year old daughter broke her glasses, I got home, heard both sides of the story and came to a conclusion that it was in fact an accident. but the babysitter said my daughter broke them intentionally after she refused to let her outside late in the evening. I asked my 11 year old daughter and she said the babysitter's story is accurate but since she and her sister have a beef then, I figured she lied to set her sister up. my 9 year old daughter cried and said she didn't mean it and it was an accident. I apologized to the babysitter for the misunderstanding but she insisted there was no misunderstanding and then asked me to pay her for a pair of new glasses. I was taken aback by her request and told her I thought we talked this out and rolled it out as an accident but she insisted it wasn't an accident. I apologized but refused and said it was unfair to expect me to pay, especially since she didn't pay attention to keep her glasses safe regardless of wether it was an accident or not. The babysitter argued with me then started crying swearing that my daughter broke them to get back at her. My 11 year old daughter sided with her but my 9 year old said she is only siding with the babysitter for her own benefits. The girls started fighting and I ended up telling the babysitter to leave. she got my co worker involved and she said I should take responsibility and pay the babysitter for new glasses since she can not afford them being a broke college student and in need for glasses. I apologized but refused to pay, my co worker got upset and shamed me for condoning my younger daughter's actions and treating the babysitter poorly when she's the victim in this situation. It's been days and the babysitter is still wanting me to pay for new glasses but I feel like she's trying to use the fact that I'm in dire need of help and is hoping to get extra money out of my pocket.",

        "selftext": "My husband and I have one daughter, age 7, and he has two older sons from a previous marriage (11 and 15). They currently live with us but had been living with his mom up until about 2 years ago. Their mom is really messed up, addicted to drugs now and on the brink of death basically due to her addictions. My husband has largely cut ties with his ex-wife but is obviously still responsible for his sons.  So here's my current dilemma: I want to send my daughter to private school, starting next year. It'll be expensive, like 15k a year, but I've talked to my husband and we can spare the money because we want our daughter to get a top-tier education. However, a few weeks ago my husband confronted me about potentially paying for his younger son's schooling as well. His oldest being in high school already is uninterested in switching schools but his younger son is apparently not opposed to the idea. I was upset because he told his son this without even telling me.  Between our salaries, we can only really afford one kid to go to a 15k/year school. I'm a bit upset because sending our daughter to private was always part of the plan, and yet my husband just casually floated the idea to his son only for him to say ok sure. And now that we've done the math we realize that we can't at all afford 30k on tuition. I still want to send my daughter to that school because we've promised her so since she was about 5, but my husband says either both kids go or neither does. I feel like he's intentionally sabotaging our daughter's chances and it's making me really upset. However I get that he wants the best for his kid as well but I resent how casually it was raised and how his son responded so casually to his dad's question.  I want to issue an ultimatum to my husband. Basically we pay for our daughter's schooling first and foremost because we made the promise to her first, and I want my husband to tell his son the bad news because he was the one that promised him something neither of us could deliver.

So My wife Liz and I have been married for 7 years. we have preschool age kids, and because we currently live in the same city as my parents. Mom would take the kids while my wife and I work. Liz is the one with a much larger income, she got an even better job opportunity that is requiring us to move to another city. I agreed since I could easily find a job in my field in the city we're moving to. but after my family heard we were selling the house to move, hell broke loose. Sunday, mom and Liz got into a huge fight because Liz told mom we'll move away and hire a babysitter for the kids so she's no longer needed. mom said she doesn't want her grandkids moving away, even said we should let the kids live at her house while we move. Liz laughed at her and mom lost it basically saying that Liz was an ungrateful witch and that her grandkids moving will only happen over her dead body. they began exchanging harsher words and Liz snapped and told mom to butt out of private matters that don't concern her. and said that she had no right to decide things regarding the kids. Mom firmly told her she was dead wrong and proceeded to tell her that she, as an involved grandmother, knows her rights and she will be taking Liz and me to court to ensure she still gets to see her grankids. Liz was in shock, she looked to the left and saw me sitting there not saying or doing anything. She told me to check my mom but I told her she was being unfair to mom and that mom had to feel upset because she will no longer be able to see her grandchildren - I honestly told Liz that she was a bit selfish to not consider my mom's feelings and her crucial presence in the kids life first. Liz started arguing with me saying she couldn't believe I didn't stand behind her and defend her after hearing mom saying she'd get the court involved. I said mom was upset and can not be blamed for her reaction. Liz started yelling at me calling me unsupportive and an enabler then went home with the kids, insisting my family is MY problem and I should handle it although this whole moving thing was her idea. Situation hasn't been resolved and Liz and mom are getting more intense in their fights. I choose to stay out of it because both have valid arguments but Liz has called me awful for not siding with her after seeing how mom spoke to her and being okay with the fact that mom was willing to cause us issues in court. AITA? I get that Liz wants my support but I feel like mom has been punished through no fault of her own after being a loving grandmother to my kids.",

Well, recently the older daughter has been disrespectful at home and staying out too late, and her grades have been slipping.  We warned her to shape up, but last week when we heard that she'd been needlessly insulting to her younger sister while I was our running errands, I told her that she'd be cleaning out the stable each day for the next week as punishment, and that her sister would get a break. She got really upset and offended, and said we promised she'd never have to go in there or have to scoop horse poop. I said I promised it wouldn't be one of your chores, of course, but obviously a punishment is supposed to be something outside of your normal chores and something you won't like, and I thought it was perfectly fair here. She's been doing it three days now but seems to be very resentful of our broken promise, acting very disgusted, and keeps begging to get out of the rest of it.

We live in different state then my family. My wife and I couldn't visit for Christmas. my parents were calling to continue complaining about us not spending Christmas with them and demanded I make it up for them. I said I was open for any suggestions they had and they suggested they come stay with us for a week once the baby is born. That way they could spend time with us and the baby as well. I thought why not that seemed to be a pretty good suggestion since it's been months since we've seen each others so I told them to go ahead and made the invitation Official. This morning my wife was talking about her plans once the baby is here and that's when I remembered my conversation with my parents. I immediately told her that I agreed to let them over for a week once the baby is born to make up for the holiday we missed with them. She first looked shocked then freaked out at me saying I shouldn't have invited them just like that without talking to her first. I asked why not since she loves them and loves being around them but she explained that my family can be a lot of work and having them as guests while caretaking for a newborn is the last thing she wanted. I told her it was no big deal besides that we could use help if she thought about this way but she lashed out on me about how the first few days of the baby's life is essential time for bonding and being intimate and I just took that away from her by inviting my parents and invading her space. I argued that she was being melodramatic right then because my family are decent people and I'm pretty sure they'll make this experience a lot more warmer but she still disagreed and said if my family were decent then they wouldn't have accepted my invitation but I clarified to her that I did NOT invitem and this was in fact a suggested made by them and I just agreed AFTER they complained about me missing spending the holidays with them. She went off on me demanding I call them and cancel everything I planned with them but I thought that was unacceptable since she gave not a good-enough reason for me to do that and besides my parents can help but she still denied that being true. She's gone radio silence for the rest of the day and is acting like my family are somehow making her uncomfortable though they're not the judgemental or intrusive type and are just about spending time with each others. AITA? Hold on! #Edit few things so there's no misunderstanding here. Alright? First of all my wife doesn't normally have an issue with my family being around, they all get along pretty good. and second of all which is an important info my wife and I talked about having her directly speak to them about why she would rather postpone their visit so we could clear the air but she refused and said she doesn't want to ruin her relationship with them and asked me to do it (tell them not to come) but since my family are upset with me then me telling them not to come might be taken in an offensive way, you know what I'm saying? so it really feels like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place. also, to all the people saying that my wife shouldn't be hosting guests. I don't recall mentioning this nor expecting her to do anything for the family. matter of fact I really thought we could maybe use their help especially my mom.",

Not like an Instagram wannabe but a real professional model with professional shoots and an agency and everything. She also practices martial arts has a few black belts and works as an instructor in her school, gym, dojo whatever its called. She usually tells people shes a martial arts instructor and not a model. For some reason she doesn't like to tell people she's a model even though thats where she makes most of her money. She only makes like 12 dollars an hour and works part time as a martial arts instructor. So the other day I was introducing her to some people and she told them she was a martial arts instructor when they asked her what she did. I said Thats not really how she makes her money though shes a model and she shot me this dirty look. Later she said I was an asshole for saying that that she doesn't like to tell people shes just met that shes a model and I had no right to correct her. That what she said is true, she does teach martial arts and she wasn't lying. That her passion is teaching martial arts but it doesn't pay that well so she models to pay the bills but that's not what shes passionate about. I dont see what the big deal is so AITA here for telling people what she really does for money? **Edit just to clarify I she didnt tell me she preferred to not say she was a model specifically beforehand. I just noticed she never mentioned it but it was not something we talked about until after I did it. Also I was genuinely proud of her for being a model and when I introduced her to my friends. **Edit 2 Theres so many comments and I am trying to read them all. I do respect her. I do love her for more then her beauty. Shes a genuinely good and kind person, she loves kids (she teaches kids in her classes) animals, just a very big hearted and sweet woman. She's smart and fun and we share a lot of interests. Honestly I am blown away with how pretty she is and I've never dated a woman who is as pretty as she is. So that part does excite me. I genuinely thought the modelling was the more prestigious of her accomplishments because while you may think I am the asshole for this I do value how much money a field brings in. When I chose my area in college I did choose between a few specialties because this one paid the most. I am going to talk to her about it and find out more about why she values the martial arts more and I am not going to judge based on how much money it makes. I'm going to respect whatever reasons she has. I shot an apology text (We're both at workright now) and sent her flowers to her Dojo. She said we can talk after work and I offered to take her to her favorite restaurant.  **Final Edit At this point I imagine no one is reading anymore I asked the mods if I should post this update and they said to edit it into the original post. I was really bothered by the things people said. Not because I wanted to bury my head and refuse to accept them but because maybe there was some truth to it. I didn't want to be the guy everyone said I was. I really didn't.  First I want to make it clear that she never told me before not to refer to her as a model. Yes I knew she usually didn't lead with it but it was never something we had discussed before. We have been dating for around 3-4 months.  Next I want to say She was meeting some of my good friends. I was not trying to show her off in that she was a trophy for me. I was trying to point out her accomplishments. I thought it would make her look better for my friends to know she also made good money as a model. I can see where I was wrong. I did place more value on her career as a model because she made more money and I felt it was more glamorous. I am an asshole for that. I did interject that she was a model and undermine the image she wanted to project of herself and I'm also the asshole for that too. I wont deny it. But I DONT just see her as a trophy. I do see her as a complete and wonderful person and theres more on that later because I learned something really really important.  After this thread blew up like it did and I had hundreds and later thousands of responses saying what a dick I was I knew I was dead wrong and had fucked up. I texted her with an apology and she said she was used to that bullshit. I asked her if we could talk about it and I could try and make it up to her. She agreed. I told her I wanted to learn more about what she did as a martial arts teacher and asked her if I could sit in on some of her classes. She said she would like that. I made it top priority. I left the office early to go and sit in and see what this was about.  What I saw really opened my eyes to be honest. I watched two classes and took part in the second one. The first one was her with a kids after school class. She was kind, patient, and just really great with the kids. Someone said something  to the effect that she couldn't be that successful if she only taught kids. Thats dead wrong. It must be much harder to teach kids and I think it makes her a much better teacher that shes able to reach and teach these kids. I saw how she will be a great mother (and before you rip me a new one she DOES want to be a mom one day).  The second class was a womens self defense class. I took part in this one as the bad guy and I was a practice dummy for her lessons on how to fend off assaults. I got manhandled by about 15 women. We had a a few short sparring sessions in between her classes and she worked me. For those of you who wanted her to beat me up she got the chance to (although she didn't hurt me she could have if she wanted to)  I definitely saw the value beyond money in what she does. She taught 30 kids about discipline, confidence, courage, standing up to bullies, she taught 14 women how to defend themselves from an assault. Most importantly I saw the qualities beyond her appearance that I love most about her really shine. I realized the things I love most about her; Her courage, her compassion, her strength, her assertiveness, her kindness, and patience, her wisdom, her discipline this is where it comes from. This is really the part of her I love. It doesn't come from the modeling it comes from this. I also saw how much she loved what she was doing. I saw in her a light that shone in a way that never does when she talks about modeling. I'm honestly a little emotional about how wrong I was.  I told her this when I went out to dinner and we talked about what it means to her and why its important. She also filled me on the modeling thing. She doesn't like to lead with it for a number of reasons that most of you pointed out  First off its not as glamours as I thought it was  She said many times she has to deal with negative stigmas as the result of saying shes a model  She works as a model because of a few accidents. She was born pretty and she ran into an agent as a teenager. Thats all it took for her to be a model. It took her years of work and dedication to be where she is with martial arts. She started as a little girl and pushed through it all throughout both her childhood and her teenage years which is pretty impressive when you consider how transient interests usually are for kids and teens. She feels a greater sense of accomplishment and fulfillment doing this then having her pictures taken. She said being called a Model defines her by her appearance defines her by WHAT she is and not WHO she is. She doesn't want to be defined by the way she looks she wants to be defined by what she does. She doesn't feel that being a model is who she is its just something she does to make money but its not a core part of her identity.  She doesn't feel the modeling industry encourages a healthy body image for other women and feels guilty that she is the image that many other women look to and are expected to look like. That she often has to deal with jealousy from other women or that she can make other women feel insecure about themselves and she doesn't like that. She doesn't want other women to feel bad about themselves because of her. She feels while its hypocritical of her to profit off of it she feels like it would be stupid to turn down the chance to make good money while she can. She wants to use this opportunity while she is still young enough to earn up the money to open her dojo or buy the ones she works at now and do that full time when she ages out of modelling.  This is where I lit up and felt I had something to really offer her. I work in finance. Go ahead hate me but I DO like money. I like to have it, I like to make it, I like the freedom it affords and I like to watch it flow and grow. So I offered to help her come up with a financial plan to reach her goal of opening up her own dojo. I thought it was a great opportunity for me to use what I know and love to help her do what she knows and loves. We both win. She agreed and next week we are going to meet to go through her finances and I will put together a plan to help her hit her goal.  Finally I asked her if it was ok to sign up for one of her classes and she lit up and said she would love that.  I know a lot of you are probably going to be disappointed she didn't dump me on the spot. I learned a lot today, a lot about her, a lot about myself. In the end this turned out to be something that helped me learn a lot more about who she is and why I love her. So honestly thank you AITA yea you were mean, yea you were vitriolic, yea it hurt, but I needed it to show me how far up my own ass my head was. Is she the better person? Yes she is. Do I deserve her. No I dont, But I am going to do better. I really do love this woman, I wont ever do this again.",

        "selftext": "Throwaway account and fake names because my wife is also on Reddit. And sorry for the long post.  My wife (39F) and I (42M) have three sons, Alex (15), Dylan (11), and Jake (8). When I was a kid I always wanted a dog but my parents said no. I never got the chance to get one during my twenties but recently my interest in owning one was sparked again so I asked my family what they thought about getting a dog. My wife wasn\u2019t enthusiastic about it but she relented after a few weeks of me asking. Alex and Jake were excited to get one but Dylan was immediately opposed to the idea.  Dylan was always different than my other sons, he never had an interest in sports and was always more subdued than his brothers which has always made it hard for me to connect with him.  He remained opposed to the idea of getting a dog but me and my other sons managed to wear him down until he finally relented. However, he said that if we did get a dog, he wasn\u2019t going to be interacting with it or taking care of it, that would be completely on me and his brothers. I found this ridiculous but i agreed in the moment hoping he would change his mind after meeting the dog.  The problem is he hasn\u2019t changed his mind yet. We\u2019ve had Zeus for seven months now and Dylan has not warmed up to him in the slightest.  He doesn\u2019t play with the dog, he doesn\u2019t cuddle with him, he doesn\u2019t let Zeus into his room because he \u201cdestroys stuff\u201d and whenever he is near the dog he just ignores him. I find this completely ridiculous. Zeus loves Dylan, he follows him around whenever he sees him and jumps on him to get his attention and play but Dylan just isn\u2019t receptive to it. To change this, I told Dylan last week that he would be in charge of walking the dog every day after school. Dylan straight up refused and has shut down the conversation every time I bring it up. It\u2019s been a week and he hasn\u2019t walked the dog once.  In my frustration, I told him that if he didn\u2019t start listening then I wouldn\u2019t allow him to go to the comic book store anymore and he freaked and told my wife. Now, my wife is upset with me, claiming that I knew what I was getting into with this and I knew that Dylan wouldn\u2019t be playing with the dog but his intolerance of the dog is weird and I refuse to entertain it any longer.  My wife has been short with me ever since that conversation and Dylan is cold with me as well. Alex is now agreeing with his mother which is making me have second thoughts. So Reddit, AITA?",

Me and my husband's divorce just got finalized last month and it's honestly a different type of pain, but I thankfully have wonderful friends and family who've been supporting me all the way. We had Christmas dinner with family. A lot of my relatives kept checking in with me, asking if I was doing okay and bringing me food. I felt really loved and it was pretty fun overall, and took my mind off everything for a bit. My cousin A's fiance recently passed. She was at dinner, but wasn't talking much and mostly kept to herself. I saw her getting soda, so I asked if she could bring me one as well. That didn't go well. A got upset and started going off at me, why she should have to bring me things and I can get my own. I told her it's completely fine if she doesn't, I just asked since she was already there and she's making a big deal. A looked like she was about to cry, and kept going off about how I expected everyone to fawn over me and no one cares about her and her fiance. I told A we're all doing our best. I'm sorry if she feels that way but this isn't a grief competition, and she should understand that. A few people overheard us, but the conversation changed and it wasn't a huge issue. A's sister messaged me later that what I said to A is awful and we're all awful to her. I told my best friend what happened and she suggested I post on here for opinions. I didn't think this was such a big deal, but A thought otherwise. Was I the asshole here?",

        "selftext": "My husband and I (both 27) got married a few weeks ago and he obviously is still upset about it but I don\u2019t think I was wrong so I thought I would ask here. We only gave plus ones to married couples or if we knew the SO well. My husband has one childhood friend that was coming from out of state to attend. I\u2019ve met him a bunch but only his girlfriend of three years a few times because of the distance.  I didn\u2019t want to give him a plus one but my husband begged since he was traveling and didn\u2019t know anyone else at the wedding and he didn\u2019t want him to be uncomfortable or have to travel alone. I said fine just to make him happy.  Flash forward to the reception I see him with some girl I have never seen before. I asked husband what was up and he told me that his friend and his gf broke up a few days before the wedding and since he already rsvped as 2 he brought a friend with him.  I was pissed since I made an exception for him and I didn\u2019t want anyone random at my wedding. I had one of my bridesmaid go to him and tell him he could stay but can his date please go back to the hotel this is a private event.  He said ok and didn\u2019t make a fuss but he left with her and didn\u2019t come back. I though on everything was fine and had a great night.  My husband found out about it the next day and we got in an argument. He\u2019s mad because his friend traveled and I kick him out without talking to him. I didn\u2019t kick him out just his date.  Now it\u2019s a few weeks later my husband still brings it up from time to time and his friend hasn\u2019t been answering his texts. I kind of feel bad but it was my wedding and I didn\u2019t want any strangers there.",

She wanted me to play it but I initially declined since I'm not into visual novels or reading long stories but after she begged, I gave it a try and played for a good 15 mins. Now I can tell she put in a lot of effort in the writing and the art and it was a good start but I just got tired of reading and stopped. She asked what I thought and wanted me to eventually finish it and tell her what I thought about the choices and the endings but I told her I had no plans to. She looked shocked and asked if it was boring, I told her no, it's just that I'm just not into this type of genre and she knows im not into reading but asked me to make an exception this time since she made it. I got upset because I think she is being childish and wants to blackmail me into doing something I don't want. After I made it clear I wasn't continuing, she hasn't talked to me. I already know that she is talented and smart so just because I don't want to play it doesn't mean I dont support her. Some of my friends agree she's being immature but others think I should be more supportive. So AITA?",

        "selftext": "My son is 18, He is going to be attending community college and is living with me, my husband and his 2 younger half sisters. The other day I found out that he found and accepted a job without telling me. I was upset with him about it and the reason for that is that first of all, he should've told me since we live in the same house and also, and more importantly now I'm left without someone to stay with the girls from 3 to 8 where my shift start-ends. my son is usually the one to stay home with the girls and his new job is during these hours so one way or another we are impacted. He told me his friend found him this job and it just happened - but I don't think it did because he knew he had to give up staying with his sisters while I work. my husband travels most of the time (he's a pilot) and paid child care is a no for me. My son said I shouldn't be surprised by him trying to work to save money to be able to pay for himself but that is just absurd since he literally lives with us without having to pay for anything except for his own entertainment. He said he needed the job and he wasn't reallistically going to stay and watch his sisters for days on end especially he doesn't get paid for it. We kept arguing and my husband got involved and he too was upset saying that my son had no respect for us. my son basically had a like it or not attitude with us and kept refusing to discuss this wirh us saying we have no right to be upset with him and should just accept it. but I'm just...I think that he's being inconsiderate of my husband's and I's struggle to provide for the family as a whole. this should mean something to him but he acted selfishly. ETA okay, it seems that I did not mention the reason why the babysitter option isn't ideal and is because my daughters don't want a babysitter. they're both dealing with some issues and are unconfortable being with a stranger at home. besides that my son decided to stay with them and we didn't ask him or anything. ETA Okay, some of you here are implying or suggesting that I'm making my son to be the girls' babysitter but that is in fact not true. He doesn't do much for them, just stays home with them while he studies or plays video games. He adores his sisters and only stays with them when he wants to. otherwise we wouldn't force him. Also, my husband said the girls are too young for therapy and I agree with him on that.",

        "selftext": "So, two weeks ago, I (25F) got married to my husband (26M). When I was six years old, my mom and dad got divorced and, three years later, my mom met and married Fred, who had basically been my surrogate dad for all these years because my biological one hasn't been a huge part of my life, and Fred's kids (20M), (18F) and (16M) are basically my siblings.  On last minute, my bio-dad decided he didn't want to come to my wedding and walk me down the aisle. I got the call while I was getting my makeup done and I was devastated, needless to say. Fred was in the room with me and he started comforting me, telling me it would all be okay, and he said if you want, I can walk you down.  That just rubbed me wrong and I was already a mess emotionally. Fred knew how much I wanted my bio-dad to walk me down the aisle, and he just suggested it like it didn't matter at all, like I hadn't just gotten my heart broken, and I just snapped and told him he was selfish and told him to get out. Fred left and one of my uncles ended up walking me down the aisle.  My mom only heard about mine and Fred's fight AFTER the wedding, and she is now pissed off at me, telling me that I overreacted and that I needed to apologize to Fred even though I was just frustrated and he had suggested something totally out of the leftfield. My mom told me that I was the selfish one apparently and apparently I'm ungrateful.  But I feel like his suggestion was completely wrong and that I don't need to apologize, but I don't want to make things worse by not apologizing if I did do something wrong. So, aita?",

        "selftext": "I (39M) have a son (17 M) who recently got a girlfriend. His girlfriend is black and a very nice, kind and beautiful young lady. I have met her and invited her for dinner and family events plenty of times and she\u2019s a joy to be around. But recently my mother has been staying with us because she  is recovering from a surgery she had and she\u2019s going on 70 years old so she can\u2019t do much on her own. Long story short my mother is a classic racist and being a raging narcissist and she is not one to hold back from her opinions. I showed her a photo of my son and his girlfriend and she went on a 2 hour rant about bloodlines and kept saying they \u201cdon\u2019t look right\u201d and when I said she was coming to dinner she said doesn\u2019t want the girl near her because it\u2019ll \u201cdisturb her\u201d so last minute I told her she could not come. My son has been trying to invite his girlfriend over everyday since but I said no multiple times due to his grandmother being here and her saying she doesn\u2019t want her near her, I just don\u2019t want any problems. But he argues that I am being \u201ca complacent racist\u201d by even allowing her to be here. And even more so for not allowing her to come over to \u201cprotect a racist\u201d. He says I should of told her to leave the moment my mother said all that stuff. But my mother is an elderly woman who can hardly make it on her own as it is. Definitely much harder after surgery. Though I don\u2019t agree with her I can just leave her to fend for herself. I literally do not know what to do. My wife says my son is right about me being complacent but of course she\u2019d agree because her and my mother don\u2019t get along well. I know I am not a damned racist. But now everyone is saying I am aiding one by taking my mothers side. So AITA? Edit: Hello everyone last night I posted this after me and my son argued over this all day and my wife is giving me the silent treatment. I can really reply to anyone because the moderators locked this post. I woke up this morning with thousands of notifications. I just posted this thinking maybe 20 people would reply. The messages and comments are overwhelming. But I will answer everything as best as I can. Firstly no I can not afford to put my mother in a home. I\u2019m not rich and I\u2019m not poor but I do have 3 children I need to provide for and my wife. The savings I have I won\u2019t spend on anything but their college funds. And my mother definitely doesn\u2019t have the money to afford those homes. She lives by herself, with me and younger my sister occasionally going over a few times a week to help her. This situation is just special because she had benign tumor removed. If I could of I would have had her stay with my sister but my sister is pregnant and very soon to go into labor. So I offered her to stay. She is a difficult person to be around but she\u2019s my mother and she\u2019s still has about 7 more weeks until she\u2019s able to go back to being on her own. Second, I have no problem with my sons girlfriend. I actually would be happy if he chose to settle down with her in the future. I want to welcome her in my home. She had been coming over and basically apart of the family for months now up until this. And now my son says she thinks we don\u2019t want her around anymore. I can see why people are saying I am the asshole after reading through I still am unsure how to go about this still. People are saying I should invite her over and tell my mom that she will not say anything out of the norm to her or else I\u2019ll send her off. But people are also saying I should not bring her over knowing it\u2019s a possibility that my mother will do something anyway. Kicking my mother to curb for now is not an option but I will privately tell his girlfriend the situation and ask her what she would like to do and make arrangements from there. Also people are calling my son an AH for wanting her to come over because of this. I am okay with being criticized on here but please do not shame my son. I think he is just getting anxious because him and her don\u2019t go to the same school and the only way they see each other at my house because my son says her father is very overprotective and intimidates him every time he goes to her house. I do understand I was going about this in a very easy way by just doing what my mother says for the time being because I did not want to start drama. But she is the bad guy in the situation and she is the one who needs to change and I should not be accommodating her prejudice ways and my son or his girlfriend should not have to suffer because of her.  Thanks for all the advice.",

        "selftext": "Yeah it sounds bad but it really was an innocent thing. I was at a cookout with my wife's family and I just opened up a cold one. My wife's three year old neice asked me what I was drinking, and I told her it was beer. She asked to taste it, so I poured her like a tenth of a sip into a plastic cup thinking it will be bitter for her, but, well, she liked it. She wanted more and I told her it was a grownup drink but it was too late. She ran around demanding to drink more beer for the entire cookout, she wouldn't eat anything, just demanded beer, and they had to put her in a time out. Anyway, the inlaws are mad now and the wife isn't happy. So AITA? Edit: the kids are given watered down wine on  shabbas if it's relevant Update: apologised and sorted it out with the in laws. They know I love that little rascal and would never intend to harm her. I do agree with people that things like that should be leveled with the parents first. Interesting that the divide along YTA/NTA was highly correlated with upbringing - Europeans and more rural oriented Americans (for lack of better wording) did realise that this a just a dumb brain fart on my part at worst, and just being an uncle at best. I think mostly Americans were highly critical of my actions, there does seem to be a series taboo regarding alcohol and boundaries in that culture. I guess its a matter of outlook, as most things are. Having said that, I got some literal death threats, and some people said I should be locked up and never ever be around children. Really now?",

        "selftext": "I feel like the devil right now, so I\u2019ll accept whatever judgement you all have. I run a team of about 6 people. Our company offers a large amount of maternity leave, 10 months. One of my employees got pregnant recently, i\u2019ll call her Jess.  Our team does project based work and in the period between her leaving for ML we finished up the project we were working on when she left, and started working on a project without her.  During this period, our team had to adapt to working without her expertise in certain matters. We adapted and eventually some of us developed the skills needed to do some of her workload. The situation we have now is me, and 2 others split half the work that Jess used to do, and we hired someone new to come in to the team to handle the other part of Jess\u2019s workload and then some.  This new employee came at significantly reduced cost, as he was straight out of Uni and we pay him a fraction of what Jess costs currently.  Now Jess has come back to the team, but there is another issue.  Our firm has informed us that for some fucking reason we no longer have the budget for a 7 person team, and will have to let someone go. This news came about when I submitted the paperwork for Jess\u2019s return.  We are 5 months into a project that should take an estimated 10 months, and my decision came down to Jess and the man we hired to replace her. The reason we hired a replacement, which is not normally what we do, is because we anticipated that for this project the workload would be far greater than our current capacity, which it is not.  As you can tell by the title, I chose the replacement. I did so for the following reasons:  * Far cheaper, thus freeing up a lot more money than keeping Jess on* He was up to date with the project and we would be able to move forward seamlessly, whereas with Jess we would have to take time catching her up to speed on half the project* The clients already knew and liked working with him, whereas they didn\u2019t know Jess at all* She has been out of the field for a prolonged period, whilst he has been here for the past 9 months, so she may, or may not, find it hard to adapt back to work life, whilst with him it isn\u2019t a question* He performed his work better than she did hers and interacted better with the team.  Obviously, the ideal situation which I wanted was to keep both and not put a new single mother with no other job lined up out in the cold, but I had to do right by the team and firm. I told her I\u2019d write her a brilliant Letter of Recommendation, and that in a few months she could try and apply for a job at our firm, hopefully we\u2019ll have the budget, but she snapped at me and told me not to bother, and called me a cunt and left.  I know I sound cold and heartless but I had to be fair to both employees, not just Jess, right?  AITA?",

It\u2019s relevant to mention that I really dislike parties and large gatherings, I\u2019m not sociable at all and I really just dislike them. So it was kind of a downer when I heard that Alan and Helen were going to have a wedding with around 150 people. I told Alan ahead of time that I would probably leave early and that me and the rest of our family would take two cars so that they could stay if they wanted to. He looked like he didn\u2019t mind at the time. So at the wedding itself, after the ceremony I basically told him that I was glad and it looked great but I was going to go home. He asked if I was going to at least stay for cake or for food but the food didn\u2019t look all that appetizing to me so I told him I was just going to leave. He said \u201calright whatever just go\u201d and I went back to my table to get my stuff. I told my wife and she said she didn\u2019t feel comfortable driving back alone (the venue was very far from us and the roads there were not great). I said in that case she should come with me and after some hemming and hawing she agreed. So we left. Then two days later Alan\u2019s new wife bombarded me and my wife with messages that she was disgusted with us, saying horrible things about us and insulting us as people and as parents. Really just sickening. I told her off and asked why she thought it was okay to talk to her in laws like that and she said that us leaving \u201cruined\u201d the wedding for Alan and that he was very upset for the rest of the night. She continued to berate us. I politely told her to leave us alone and called Alan, mainly to inform him that his wife had a temper that he should know about. When we talked about it he basically started berating me too and said things like \u201cyou always do this\u201d and \u201cjust leave me alone\u201d before hanging up. I feel like I\u2019m justified since I told him ahead of time that I wasn\u2019t going to stay. AITA here? Edit since so many people care about the details: Yes there was a mother son dance planned. Yes he included me in the count for the food costs. Yes I love him. No this does not mean that I do not care about him.",

        "selftext": "So we tied the knot and decided that after saying 'I do', 'Sarah' and I would each have our own digital camera to take any photos we wanted during the rest of the day to record our own personal memories, then put these in a section of our wedding photo album. It was her idea and I thought it would be fun.  Fast forward to us getting these photos developed after the honeymoon. We look through them together for the first time- to summarise: Her photos: Me in my suit, me with our God daughter, me with a few friends, me drunk at the after party. More of guests, decorations, the beaitiful cake but most of them are of me. My photos: a seagull that was perched on the church, some guests, blurry lights, and many silly pictures of my groomsmen. As soon as Sarah saw the pictures I had taken, she was clearly holding back tears, and not happy ones. I asked her what was wrong and she wouldn't tell me at first because she felt embarrassed, but after asking a few more times she admitted that she felt disappointed that I hadn't taken a single picture of her in her dress. I basically told her that I didn't really think to, as anyone who has been to a wedding knows that every camera is pointed to the bride. She replied that she wanted to see herself through my eyes on our wedding day. This conversation went round in circles until she just snapped at me that i found a seagull more noteworthy than my bride on our wedding, and now she's gone to bed angry. I feel like this conversation isn't over but as it's our first fight as a married couple, I need to know if I'm in the wrong. So, am I the asshole here? I... feel like she's overreacting a little. I thought the cameras were intended to record whatever we felt like. I didn't know she'd expect me to take pictures of her. **EDIT: Info: we did hire a photographer during the ceremony. The cameras were for after, she wanted candid pictures to make memories. I remember her saying she was okay with some being lighthearted. She prefers candid photos because they feel more natural and capture our own memories more** **EDIT 2** I'm the asshole. And a clueless idiot. From now on I'm going to make up for it with all the candid photos possible, and have noted a few lovely little ideas from commenters. Thank you to all who have judged me, I accept my judgement",

However, my wife is often exhausted so I let my mom come over to help out with cleaning and stuff (I can barely have time to work) and also, at the same time, Spend time with the baby and bond with him a little bit. Thing is my wife acts strange whenever she sees my mom with our son. She'd make a face and talk to her in a descending tone, even raises her voice at her causing mom to feel hurt. I asked my wife about it and she said it was because of what my mom is doing. I asked her to elaporate and she complained about mom holding the baby for long and taking forever to give him back to her. mom argued that my wife could ask nicely instead of outright yelling but my wife defended herself saying that she only starts raising her voice after she's already asked a couple of times and mom won't listen. They started arguing and mom started crying. that's when I felt enraged,  pulled my wife aside and told her to stop acting out and that if she keeps this up then we won't get anymore help from mom. She argued that she was trying to feed our son and that it was awful of me to think of it as acting out. I said I understood her frustration and yes mom can do things that require some patience from us. but a little kindness can go a long way in keeping the peace in this difficult time. She called me selfish and said that it's easy for me to say when I'm not the one dealing with this. from there the argument escalated despite me trying to cut it short. I went outside to calm down and after that my wife started cold shouldering me. I told her this was not okay but she told me to go sc*ew myself and that from now on out I should deal with taking our son back from my mom when it's time for feeding since I condone this behabior. I really am not condoning anything and really think she's stressed out yes but the way she behaves around mom is, in my opinion, not okay. ETM:: My goodness! I'm seeing so much anger here. I'm sorry I can not respond to you all but I just want people to calm down and understand that I in no way  agree with some of my mom's behaviors, just how my wife reacts is......not okay and that's all. really. thank you very much though!

I don't have any issue with my brother being gay, but I have one with him wearing a wedding ring in order to pretend that he's married to him. You see, we live in a country where gay marriage still isn't allowed (Romania), but despite this, my brother and his boyfriend started wearing weddings rings recently. When I asked my brother about it, he told me that despite not being able to do it legally, they already consider themselves married spiritually and they're hoping that one day gay marriages will be allowed to do legally as well, either by leaving the country or waiting till gay marriages are made legal here as well. While I think this nice, I told him that they shouldn't be wearing wedding rings till they actually get officially married, as I think it's kind of distasteful. He told me that they're just a symbol of their love and that they're not hurting anyone by wearing them, but I disagreed, they're actively misleading people into thinking that they're actually married and frankly just making a mockery out of marriage.  My brother told me that he doesn't care what other people, including me, think about them wearing wedding rings and maybe they should just mind their own business, then left furiously. Not gonna lie, I think his comment here was kind of out of line, as all I did was to give my opinion on people wearing wedding rings when they're actually married yet and he seemed to take it personally. His boyfriend also contacted me later and told me that their romantic lives doesn't concern me and to stay out of it. AITA ?",

Except apparently HE meant \u201ca sum of money good for a down payment for a house near us\u201d where the cost of living is low. He did not ever mean a down payment for a home in Colorado, where my wife and I have lived since we were in college. He said he thought I would be \u201csmart enough\u201d to realize that we\u2019d need to move somewhere with a lower COL than Colorado. He keeps saying move to a cheaper city. Our lives are here. Our friends, our jobs, our hobbies. You can\u2019t exactly leave your house and be up on top of a 14,000ft peak in 6 hours where my family is. I told him that we had never talked about moving back there, and we never would. That we would rather be stuck renting for a while longer than be stuck somewhere we didn\u2019t want to be, and the \u201cmove to a cheaper city\u201d wouldn\u2019t work for us. He said \u201cso be it\u201d and gave us the amount and that was that. I expressed gratitude and thanked him for the money. It is still towards the goal. Well because of this shift in our finances, we have had to make a lot of changes to save up the rest of the money. We have had to cut out vacations, birthday gifts, holidays, etc. We won\u2019t be traveling home for a few years. At our current rate, we should have an ok down payment by the end of next year (2025). My Dad confronted us about this because we won\u2019t come for a summer break trip and told me that I was being a selfish, entitled brat because I hadn\u2019t gotten my way. That I was essentially punishing the rest of the family because we \u201cassumed\u201d what his gift would be. I told him that I was grateful for the amount he gave us, but that it means we do need to buckle down and save every penny if we want to be able to afford a house anytime soon. Even townhouses around us are easily over 400k, and that\u2019s for the sketchy ones. But is my Dad right? AITA? **Edit to add FAQ:** There was no amount formally discussed. He said a down payment and that was that. For my siblings, he paid for college. He paid cash in full for my sister's house, it was $317,000. He did not pay for my college. They are invited to come here anytime, but believe it should be me to go there because I am the one who moved. No, we do not go out to eat, avocado toast, Starbucks, cable, etc etc. ",

She chose a seafood restaurant that we'd never been to. In looking over the menu I saw that the vast majority of the dishes contained shellfish. There were a few fish entrees, as well as some surf and turf. But there were only a couple of non-seafood dishes. Our son (15m) is deathly allergic to shellfish. He also can't stand fish. There were only a couple of dishes there that he could actually eat. I didn't want to take him there because I knew that he wouldn't really enjoy his meal and I was worried about cross contamination. I told my daughter that this restaurant wouldn't work and that she would have to pick out a different one. My son said that he would be fine just staying home; that we could use the money that we would have spent on his meal to just order him a pizza instead. My husband also insisted that since it was our daughter's birthday that she should be able to choose the restaurant, and that our son would be fine home alone with pizza and videogames. But here's the thing; we can only afford to go out as a family every so often. When we splurge on a restaurant meal, I want BOTH of our children there. I insisted and my daughter chose a different place and we had a nice meal AS A FAMILY. But she is still a little salty that she didn't get to have her first choice of restaurants.

My girlfriend always complains about her weight and her body. I tell her I find her sexy for so many reasons outside her body and it didn\u2019t matter to me whether she got bigger or smaller. Eventually she decided she wanted to lose weight, I offered to help and when I pointed out things she could be doing better she gets mad at me. She isn\u2019t losing weight currently and in fact says she is gaining a few extra pounds. I ask her what exactly she eats in a day, she says she eats healthy so she should lose weight. I question that and we have an argument. I tell her that if she wants to show me, let me just spend a day with her and see what she eats in a day. She said only if I don\u2019t make comments on what she\u2019s eating as she\u2019s eating it. I agreed. Now by the end of the day she had consumed, a plate of avocado toast that was about 400 calories, a coffee that was 110 calories, an 800 calorie salad from chick fil a and a fry (as a \u201creward\u201d for the salad) and veggie burrito that was about 500 calories. Along with snakinga but throughout the day. Her total consumption was about 2200 calories. At the end of the day I explained this to her. My exact words were that the amount of calories she is consuming is the amount I need to maintain my weight as a man 5 inches and 20 pounds bigger, who is constantly active. So chances are she\u2019ll slowly gain weight eating like that and that eating healthy isn\u2019t going to guarantee she\u2019ll lose weight. She got super fucking pissed at me and told me I wasn\u2019t helping her and was just shaming her. I told her I want to help her but she did not listen.  AITA ",

He asked me if I would be okay without it, and I said yes. After the movie I told him I had to use the restroom. When I got out, I walked outside (he usually waits out by the entrance. But he wasn\u2019t there. I waited a few minutes, but I couldn\u2019t call him, and he had the car key. I tried walking to the car, but he wasn\u2019t there. I went back in and checked near the men\u2019s restroom, but nothing. After about ten minutes I got pretty upset. I tried to keep myself in view of the theater while I walked around it, but he wasn\u2019t anywhere. Some strangers even offered to get me an Uber.  Finally I went in and checked one more time, and he was sitting on a couch looking at his phone. I told him I\u2019d been looking for him, but I wasn\u2019t blaming about it, but he got super defensive and told me it was my fault for not seeing him and I had no reason to be upset. He kept saying \u201cI don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re so upset\u201d on the car ride back. When I tried to tell him that I wanted us to \u201cbe more in sync with each other\u201d (especially since we\u2019re going on a trip out of the country soon) he scoffed and said, \u201cdo I need to tell you where I\u2019m going to be whenever we are separate?\u201d Which felt unfair- I didn\u2019t have my phone.

They used to be the same weight until they were around 7, when Megan started getting chubby, but still healthy weight. When she was 11, Megan was considered medically overweight. I went to a doctor for advice, and he said that I shouldn\u2019t worry too much since a lot of kids gain weight right before puberty, and then \u2018balance out\u2019 after their growth spurt. The twins had their growth spurt last year, and Megan\u2019s weight has only increased since then, to the point where she\u2019s actually obese. So I decided to implement a healthy diet for the entire family. I slowly started to cut back on sugar, junk food, and unhealthy snacks. I cook them high volume, low calorie meals full of vegetables and protein so that they still feel full after eating. Neither of the twins are very athletic, so I\u2019ve also tried encouraging them to engage in physical activities, like swimming, bike riding, trampolining, etc. I tried putting emphasis on staying healthy instead of losing weight. However, Alana guessed that the real reason for this new diet is because I want Megan to lose weight. She started complaining that it\u2019s not fair that she also has to diet because her sister\u2019s fat. I told her that I didn\u2019t want Megan to feel singled out and feel as though she\u2019s the only one being punished for her weight. AITA? EDIT: I\u2019ve gone to multiple doctors, and neither of the twins have medical conditions that would influence their weight.",

        "selftext": "So I am the events chair of my fraternity for the semester and I planned out a Halloween party that happened yesterday. At the party we typically have a huge costume contest. You pay 5 dollars to enter and if you win, you win the pot. We usually pull about 30 to 50 entries. So the prize is pretty nice. This year we had 40 people enter and about 160 people attending.\u00a0 In years past, the winner has been this one specific chick That my brothers wanna fuck. Her costume is usually the typical sorority girl costume (an animal of some kind, boots, fishnet leggings, a short skirt, basically a bra or corset, and then animal ears and light face paint).\u00a0 Now I\u2019m not a Halloween nazi. This year my costume was literally just a angel wings, and white shorts, and a halo. I know fully that I\u2019m dressing up so hot guys that think I\u2019m hot will take notice and that it\u2019s not a \u201cgood costume\u201d. Her costume isn\u2019t good. Sure, she looks good in it. But the point of the party is who has the best breasts So we have the contest, and she\u2019s wearing her MO. She was a bee, but her ass was hanging out and her boobs were about to fall out of her shirt. So we held the contest, people voted anonymously, and guess what. She won. But by one vote. I hadn\u2019t voted yet, so I simply casted my vote then my vice chairman, who agreed with me casted his vote. That just happened to be enough to put her at second place.\u00a0 When I told my by brothers they bitched and moaned about it, but I told them she simply didn\u2019t win and she should do better next year. They eventually talked me into creating a runner up prize of 50 dollars to the girl. When we announced the winner, she was visibly upset. This was the first time she hasn\u2019t won in the last 4 years. Now apparently, last night one of my brothers was simping hard and told her that I intentionally voted against her because I didn\u2019t like her (not true, I\u2019m genuinely apathetic about her). She found me later that night and cursed me out and said I had a problem with her. I told her simply that we weren\u2019t having a sluttiest costume contest, but a best costume contest and that she\u2019s lucky we bent the rules to give her 50 bucks. We argued and ended up getting separated. Now a lot of my brothers are pissed at me for pissing her off. ",

About two hours in, the lights come on and an announcement crackles through the intercom: turbulence ahead, fasten seatbelts. Pretty standard stuff. Then, all hell breaks loose. This woman, maybe late 40s, impeccably dressed, starts freaking out. Screaming about air pockets, demanding to speak to the pilot, the whole nine yards. Flight attendant (super patient lady, bless her) tries to calm her down, explains it's standard procedure, turbulence is normal. Nope, not having it. This lady, who we'll name Jane, throws a fit.  Not the screeching, nails-on-a-chalkboard kind, but a cold, steely fury.  She accuses the flight attendant of lying, of putting everyone in danger, and demands to be deplaned immediately.  Flight attendant says that's not possible mid-flight, and Jane launches into this whole spiel about how she's a doctor (pulls out an ID to prove it), and if something happens, it's on the airline. Now, the rest of the plane is awake.  People are grumbling, some looking scared, a baby starts crying.  Flight attendant is trying to reason with Jane, but it's like talking to a brick wall.  Finally, I just lose it.I yell out (probably a little too loudly), Look lady, we all get turbulence.  It's not a five-star resort, but it's safe.  Sit down and shut up before you get yourself arrested!Everyone stares at me.  Jane spins around, eyes blazing, and starts in on me about disrespecting a medical professional.  I fire back that a real doctor wouldn't be causing a scene and freaking everyone out.  The flight attendant dives in, trying to mediate, but the damage is done.We hit some turbulence, not terrible, but enough to jostle the plane. Jane freaks again, and some people start getting panicky.   I feel awful, maybe I made things worse?  The flight attendant gives me a look that could curdle milk, but then steers Jame away to talk to her privately.By the time we land, things are calmer, but the tension is thick.  Jane gives me a withering look as she disembarks, and a few people mutter thanks under their breath. So, AITA?  Did I just escalate a bad situation, or was I right to shut down a meltdown that was putting other passengers on edge?  I'm honestly not sure.",

I didn't even bother mentioning the plus one to her because I knew she wouldn't want to go, she knows nobody there except for 1 girl she met one time (Lily) and Lily's boyfriend. The rest of the guest list was just the bride and groom's family + a bunch of high school friends.  Anyway, wedding rolls around and I go. Lily asks me where my girlfriend is and why she didn't come I said 'I didn't want to babysit'. I meant it as a joke as in if she had come she would be glued to me the entire time as there was nobody else there that she knows. I mention it to my girlfriend in passing today and she was visibly upset when I told her that I said that to Lily. She said it makes her look bad. She also said that I should have told her about the invite, I asked her if she would have even gone, she said no. I said what's the point then? AITA for telling Lily that I didn't want to 'babysit' my girlfriend at a wedding where she didn't know anyone?  Edit: Thank you everyone for all the comments telling me how big of an AH I am, I needed it. I took my girlfriend out for brunch, had a good talk, and I apologized. I told her going forward I will extend all invitations to her and be careful of saying things that paint her in a bad light. She is an amazing woman and what I said was not cool at all. She accepted my apology and we are good now. To clarify a few things, we've been dating for years, no we aren't breaking up over this, yes we both love each other.  She has accompanied me to numerous weddings, I don't force her to always stay at home.  I was not trying to meet an 'old high school girlfriend'. The groom invited only male friends from high school so it was me hanging around my old crew (no girls). The groom isn't going to invite high school girl friends to his wedding.  I truly didn't mean to hurt my girlfriend but I did and I accept that what I said was wrong. Thank you! ",

Some examples: A) after our first night, I heard her mother tell one of the housekeepers to clean the bedroom my girlfriend and I were staying in; I told her mother everything was in order and that I already made our bed before leaving; her mother then told me (in the presence of the housekeeper) that I shouldn\u2019t bother because that\u2019s her (the housekeeper\u2019s) job. B) the other morning my girlfriend and I woke up after everyone else had their breakfast; I went into the kitchen to grab some coffee and saw the cooks were already starting to prep for lunch, so I told them I didn\u2019t want to bother them and made the coffee myself; my girlfriend came into the kitchen moments later and saw me making coffee; later that day she complained to her mother (without even asking me how things came about) that the cooks left me to make my own coffee. I had to explain everything. C) on her father\u2019s birthday, they had a fancy dinner with some other guests that came just that day, and some of the staff was made to stand in the room with their backs to the wall as we sat at the table and ate (it was like some Downton Abbey shit). I kept my mouth shut for the entire trip, but as soon as we came back I couldn\u2019t hold it any longer and told my girlfriend it made me really uncomfortable to see how she behaved towards the staff and also gave some examples of instances when I felt her parents were rude to them. My girlfriend didn\u2019t take this well. She said that I\u2019m the AH here for judging their lifestyle. In her mind we had a perfect week together and I was withholding my judgment until I could unleash it all on her. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m an AH for speaking my mind.",

        "selftext": "Last weekend, I attended my brother\u2019s college graduation. After the ceremony, I found the rear of my trunk had been hit. The other driver was still there. She was an 18 year old who was crying hysterically while her mom tried to calm her down. The girl apologized profusely and said she had overestimated how much room she had to back out and hit my car. I wasn\u2019t upset because mistakes happen. I asked if she had insurance and she was too worked up to answer. So, I turned to her mom and she said yes, they\u2019d go get it as well as call the police so there could be an official report for the insurance company. Cool. The girl was still really worked up. I told her, it\u2019s fine. Don\u2019t worry about it. I\u2019m not upset and accidents happen. She\u2019s still a mess when the cops show up. I found this a little overdramatic and admittedly rolled my eyes. I obviously don\u2019t know this girl but it was beginning to feel like she was trying to manipulate her way out of trouble-even though the cop and I both said these things happen and that the insurance would likely take care of it. Eventually, the police left. I told the girl to calm down, it\u2019s over and stop being dramatic. Then, I got in my car and was ready to leave. My sister was with me the whole time. She told me I was unnecessarily mean to the girl. I said she was being overdramatic for no reason, especially as no one yelled at her the entire time. My sister pointed out this girl is likely a new driver, probably worried she ruined whoever she was there to celebrate, etc. Plus, she\u2019s probably worried about her rates going up. Or maybe she has anxiety or whatever. Even if she was trying to manipulate with tears, I didn\u2019t \u201chave to be a dick\u201d. I shrugged it off and let it go. So far, her insurance has been cooperative and it seems this will all be resolved rather quickly. The subject came up at the party we had for my brother. Most of my family thought I was being a dick. Though some agreed she needed to calm down. AITA? ",

I mean, me personally I would have just taken the picture, but I guess in the job description nowhere did it say take pictures for customers. I also said her reaction was a bit over the top. She said that if she didn't want to do stuff like that, working at a tourist city wasn't for her. Before I could say something back, she put in her airpods and straight up ignored me. AITA?",

        "selftext": "I recently learnt that my ex bf passed away of cancer in March, his mom called me last week to inform me of his passing and to inform me that myself and her are listed as beneficiaries on his life insurance from his employer. She instantly tells me that she doesn't know why he never changed it but I can decline or sign the cheque over to her once I receive it.. Instantly I am in shock, he's gone? And he left me on there? Why? I went back and forth wondering if this was on purpose or accidental.. it had been years, approximately 6 since we mutually civily split up. I was informed he had a new gf that lived with him and she has 2 kids from a previous relationship that threw a wrench into things more.. is there a reason she never got put on it? Was this all just a big mistake? Today it has been 1 week and this has been very hard especially since his mom has been terrorizing me all week trying to get me to agree to give her this money. She has said the most hurtful things, and has sent me the most disrespectful photos and video of her son in his last moments..As of right now I haven't even gotten in touch with the insurance company, I have no idea how much this is or if I need a lawyers help at this point.  Well today is the day I woke up knowing 100% I am keeping this money and I am not going to feel bad at all for helping my family with a gift my ex left for me. Unfortunately part of me still wonders if it's the right thing to do by my ex.. and if these were his wishes in the end. A little info too add, my home burnt too the ground 3 years ago July 20th and October 1st 2 years ago my mom passed from cancer as well... it has been a long hard few years and this money would literally buy myself a new bra for the first time in 3 years.. my little clan could really use this money and I think my ex knew that..

        "selftext": "My wife has mentioned in the past that she wanted to try the Krabby Patty burger and a pineapple Frosty from Wendy's. On my way home from work, I decided to surprise her. I picked up a Krabby Patty burger, a chicken sandwich for myself, and two pineapple Frostys. I knew she was about an hour away, so I told her I had a surprise waiting for her when she got home. To keep the food fresh, I put her burger in the fridge and the Frosty in the freezer. I even ordered the burger without lettuce, thinking I could avoid it getting soggy, and we have lettuce at home that we could add fresh. When she got home, she was excited about the Frosty and asked, Is there a Krabby Patty burger too? I told her to check the fridge, and that\u2019s when things went downhill. She got upset because the burger was cold and I didn\u2019t get fries. She said that real justice would have been me waiting for her to come home so we could both get fresh food together, or at least putting my food in the fridge too, so we\u2019d both be eating cold food. She accused me of always expecting grand thanks for doing gestures that aren\u2019t as big as I think they are and said I didn\u2019t listen to her, since she wanted the full meal, not just the burger and Frosty. She also said she\u2019s not going to pretend to be grateful for something that wasn\u2019t what she asked for. I was just trying to do something nice, and now I feel like my gesture was totally unappreciated. AITA? Update: so we talked about it and I explained that I didn't have a problem if she would have said, I appreciate the gesture but I would have liked to get it together or if we would have waited until she was home.  I told her I understood why she was upset and we both agreed that there was a better way to talk about it.  She took a bite just now and said this is just a Dave's single with fancy sauce, so she doesn't even want it anymore hot or cold. Update 2: alright y'all, thanks for the discussion.

        "selftext": "I (48m) have a daughter Lisa (15f) from my first marriage. I\u2019m not on particularly good terms with her mother, and Lisa unfortunately became an outlet for her resentment towards me, which ended up souring our relationship massively. Lisa is a good person, but unfortunately she takes after her mom in terms of demeanor and often acts rude and entitled. A few years ago I married again. Lisa decided to not attend my wedding and she said a bunch of hurtful things to my then fianc\u00e9e Rosemary (38f). Since then, our relationship got even worse. When Rosemary and I welcomed our son a year and a half ago, Lisa sent me a text saying that since I have my perfect baby now, I could stop pestering her and trying to play family with her. It hurt me deeply, and I ended up distancing myself from her, though I kept sending her $100 a month as her allowance. Recently we had an unplanned addition to our family. Long story short, Rosemary\u2019s sister, who wasn\u2019t a good parent to start with, terminated her custody rights over her son Blake (17m). Rosemary and I decided to take Blake in. Unfortunately a few years ago Blake got in a horrible car wreck that left him permanently disabled. Luckily he can somewhat walk and doesn\u2019t need 24/7 assistance around the house, but that\u2019s about it. Blake is an amazing person and he quickly became a part of our family. I decided to give the $100 allowance to Blake instead. He was beyond happy and grateful. I also made a hard decision and gave him my car. It\u2019s a \u201822 Cadillac Escalade, and I was planning on getting rid of it this year anyway since Lisa is turning 16 in a month and I wanted to gift it to Lisa. Now it\u2019s Blake\u2019s car and he absolutely loves it. He really needed a car because his mobility issues don\u2019t let him get around easily anymore, and it changed his life massively. Of course Lisa didn\u2019t like it. When she realized that she wasn\u2019t getting any allowance, she called me and asked what\u2019s wrong. It was the first call I received from her in a year, if not more. I explained that now when my family had expanded, I\u2019m not having enough money. I\u2019ll be still sending her mom the child support payments as per court agreement, but she shouldn\u2019t expect anything extra. She asked me about the car since she knew about my plans on giving her a car. I told her that now the situation changed and I no longer could give her a car. I\u2019ll admit, what I said next was probably assholish of me, since I told her that I now have two children to play family with and asked her to stop pestering me.  This caused her to blow up completely to the point she got her mom to call me and scream at me, and so did her new husband. They threatened to sue me, Lisa said she\u2019ll go no contact and so on. I just brushed off the threats, especially since Rosemary is a lawyer and I made my peace with poor contact with Lisa years ago. They also managed to write a few mean things to Rosemary and Blake, and this is what got me wondering whether I was an asshole here.",

        "selftext": "I've been raising my 8yo nephew Jack after both his parents died in 2019. I went from being a 34 year old bachelor to being a single dad overnight. I don't regret it or anything but it has and does require a lot of sacrifice. My brother made good money and invested into a house before died. It's being rented at a loss because the rent is less than the mortgage and other costs but it will be worth a fortune when it is paid off. So I'm basically paying for an 8yo and a house I don't even live in. I also have Jack in a private school.  This summer Jack wanted to go to a sleepaway camp. It's for six weeks and I could only afford two even though it's a three week minimum. He left last week. Out of the blue, the camp called me up and said someone wanted to sponsor Jack for the whole summer. I was confused. They said a pair of angels heard of my hardship and wanted to help out. I said I wouldn't even consider unless they told me who was paying for it. Eventually they said it was the parents of a boy who is an acquaintance of my son. They act like they're better than everyone and come from old money. I've heard them say nasty things about the people that they've helped. I reached out to them and said my finances are none of their business and I'm not their charity case. I'm not here to make feel better about themselves. They were taken aback by my response and asked me to think of Jack. I said your attitude proves my point. For the record, Jack has a fun summer planned out which includes many playdates and trips with his cousins and his other uncle is taking him to Legoland in a couple weeks. He's not working in the mines this summer. Edit: The house was half paid off when I took possession if it. It costs me $400 a month to keep it. I would have lost like 80k before the mortgage is paid off. But the house can easily sell for a million.  Why would I sell a house at loss when I can keep it at a loss but then sell it at a gain in 15 years? Edit: You damn right that the house is mine.  Why shouldn't I be compensated for raising my nephew? So he should get his 250K AND a house whereas I find myself in debt at 53? He's already starting off at an advantage and if I should die then he'd get the house or whatever I have from selling it.  It's a small compensation to have saved him from going to foster care. I'm sure my brother and my nephew would want me to have the house for putting my entire life and future on hold to raise him. ",

        "selftext": "I (28M) have a gf (28F) that just recently decided to sign up for a half-marathon come December. The reason why she signed up is because she doesn\u2019t want to go to an event that\u2019s also happening that day so she has a built-in excuse (That\u2019s pretty wild to me). She asked me beforehand and I told her I thought that was a bad idea. She doesn\u2019t like running (nor does she runs) and she could find another excuse that isn\u2019t running a half-marathon. She still signed up anyways. She then told me that she will follow a 12-week plan for running the half-marathon that was given to her with her inscription. Here\u2019s the thing, I\u2019m a runner in an elite running club, I\u2019ve run over a dozen half-marathons and countless 5ks and 10ks in my life. This summer I ran a 10k and a half-marathon. I finished 5th overall in the 10k, and 12th in my category for the half-marathon. I\u2019m by no means a \u201cgood\u201d runner (good as in make a living running) but I do know what I\u2019m talking about.  She\u2019s often talked about wanting to get \u201cin shape\u201d which I\u2019ve always encouraged but never pushed for (it\u2019s not my place). About a month ago she started to go to Barre classes and she\u2019s enjoying them quite a bit (I\u2019ve gone with her a couple times too), so I assumed that going to Barre classes was the final motivation she needed to sign up for the half-marathon. Anyways, I advised her to start walking and jogging now before she starts the 12-weeks program. I told her that she needs to build a cardio-base before she takes on a half-marathon program that includes jogging, repetitions, intervals, long-distance, hills, etc. She doesn\u2019t want to because she\u2019s not willing to stop going to Barre classes and she gets tired doing two workouts a day. I told her that a half-marathon is a *lot* mileage and that she needed to get extra prepared so she doesn\u2019t get injured in the race. She said she\u2019s not interested in achieving a \u201cgood time\u201d and just that she wants to finish, even if it\u2019s walking. Also that she has a cardio base from playing basketball growing up (she stopped playing basketball 8 years ago). I told her that she made this commitment and that she should take it more seriously, 12-weeks for a half-marathon is a pretty standard program when you have been running and you want to hit your peak in the race, not when you\u2019re about to start from scratch. That was the last straw and she got really upset with me saying that I was trying to put her down, not being supportive of her, and that it\u2019s not easy for her when her boyfriend is in great shape and she isn\u2019t. At that point I apologized for making her feel that way and that I would drop it. I do feel that I need to find a better way to approach it but I want to know was I the Asshole?",

There\u2019s this trampoline park in town that offers sleepover parties where the kids could play for a few hours, watch a movie, and have a sleepover on the trampolines. Her school is very small, so there are only 20 students in her entire year. When we were booking the event, she said to only book 19 places. I asked her if she was sure she wasn\u2019t missing out someone, but she assured me there were only 19 kids in her class, and I was just misremembering. Fast forward to her birthday, and this girl \u201cKamilla\u201d shows up with an entire box full of gifts: teddy bears, perfume, candles, nail polish, flowers, chocolates, etc. I remembered picking up my from school at the beginning of the school year and seeing her chatting and being very friendly with Kamilla, so I assumed they were quite good friends. When Kamilla went up to hug my daughter and wish her a happy birthday, she lightly pushed her away and told Kamilla she couldn\u2019t attend as we forgot to book her place. I apologised to Kamilla and her mother and offered to talk to the people in charge and pay for her place, but my daughter insisted that Kamilla couldn\u2019t come. Kamilla was very distraught over this and started sobbing. I pulled my daughter aside and asked her why Kamilla couldn\u2019t join, even though they used to be friendly and she\u2019d invited every other student in her year. She said that Kamilla was just really weird, obsessive, and creepy, and she didn\u2019t want to be friends with her anymore. I asked her if Kamilla was bullying her, and she said no, she just didn\u2019t want to be around Kamilla. Kamilla\u2019s mother had found out about the party through another parent and Kamilla decided to surprise my daughter knowing she hadn\u2019t been given an invite. I returned the gifts to Kamilla, apologised again, and gently told her that there weren\u2019t enough spaces. Her mother started screaming at me, telling me that I was a grown adult woman bullying a preteen girl. I told her that it was my daughter\u2019s birthday party, she could invite whoever she wanted. She accused me of raising my daughter to be a bully, and that she couldn\u2019t just invite the entire class and exclude one girl. She claimed that Kamilla was my daughter\u2019s \u201cbest friend\u201d and she had to right to be invited. I told her that my daughter\u2019s a teenager, not a 5 year old, she can\u2019t be forced to invite the entire class just to be nice. I said that I didn\u2019t want to raise a doormat. I didn\u2019t want to teach her to value the feelings of others at the expense of her own - if my daughter feels uncomfortable around someone, then I prioritise HER wellbeing over that of a stranger\u2019s. Kamilla\u2019s mother is now talking to the teachers to punish my daughter for \u201cbullying\u201d. I\u2019ve tried explaining to her that my daughter was simply setting her boundaries, she shouldn\u2019t have to face consequences for that. Kamilla\u2019s mother said that I was an \u201cevil b*tch\u201d who \u201ctook joy in bullying little girls\u201d. AITA?",

She\u2019s also very competitive. My husband is also very competitive.  My daughter started off this vacation by telling my husband there was sudoku on the plane and explaining how to play. He didn\u2019t know that she\u2019s been playing sudoku for months. She made a bet with him that if she finishes the hardest level first, he\u2019d buy her wifi for the flight and if he finished first she\u2019d share a bed with his younger daughter on the trip (his younger daughter was complaining about sharing with his oldest because she kicks and sleeps in the middle of the bed. She beat him and pestered him until he bought the wifi.  When we got there she\u2019d challenge him to races on land and in the pool (she\u2019s won medals at state track meets and has been swimming since she was 2). Every day she\u2019d challenge him to something, win, and he\u2019d have to buy her something from the resort or local shops.  My husband was getting sick of losing and my stepdaughters were upset that their dad was buying her stuff and not them so I told my daughter she either couldn\u2019t compete with her stepdad or she had to let him win.  She decided to tell her stepdad that she wasn\u2019t allowed to compete with him anymore because he couldn\u2019t handle losing. This made them start to argue so I told her that if she didn\u2019t keep it up she\u2019d be grounded to the resort for the rest of the trip (a little over a week at this point). She decided to test me so I stuck to my word and she was left at the resort while the rest of us went out every day.  The vacation was much more enjoyable without her turning everything into a competition but she told her dad when she got back that we grounded her and he\u2019s mad at me now for leaving her there and excluding her from the vacation because my husband couldn\u2019t act like an adult.  I told him my daughter was warned to stop but she decided to test me and now he\u2019s forcing her to stick to the custody schedule (technically I have her every other weekend but he was letting her go back and forth whenever she wanted) and is threatening to go to court for child support and back pay.  AITA for grounding her for ruining the vacation?",

        "selftext": "I have 2 stepdaughters, Scarlett (18), and Ava (16).  Scarlett is an amazing singer. She's been in some kind of voice lessons since she was 10 and just graduated from one of the best performing arts schools in the state, where she went on a full scholarship since 6th grade. She has a YouTube channel where she sings that she's starting to make money from and was accepted into some very prestigious music schools. Additionally, she has been working paid gigs for the last 2 years and makes at least $500-1000 per week, more in the summers. She's even been the opening artist at a few concerts. I'm not trying to brag, I'm just saying she's an objectively good singer.  Ava, on the other hand, is not a good singer. She likes to believe she is and she might become one if she actually stuck with voice lessons or choir classes but she always quits after 1-2 weeks because they're bullying her (giving constructive feedback, I've seen the notes her classmates and teachers have given her).  Ava also likes to sing very loudly and/or at bad times. For example, if she feels that we're too quiet at the dinner table she starts to loudly sing. It doesn't sound good and I honestly don't know how she doesn't hear it. If you ask her to stop she keeps going and if you're blunt and say stop, that doesn't sound good/we don't want to hear it she keeps going and gets even louder just to annoy you.  If we're in the car and we don't let her choose the songs she'll loudly sing whatever she wants, not what's playing, to annoy us and responds the same way to us telling her to stop. The only person she listens to is her dad.  A few weeks ago we were trying to eat and she was singing again. I told her to stop and she refused so I took her plate and told her from now on she is no longer allowed to eat at my table. She can eat in her room, the backyard, her car, the garage, wherever she wants as long as we can't hear her from the dining room and that this will continue until she can behave appropriately at the table.  My husband and I argued about it but he's not home for dinner so there isn't much he can do about it. Today she was eating lunch with us and started singing again. I told her to stop and she didn't listen so I again took her plate and told her to eat somewhere where we can't hear her if she doesn't want to act appropriately. Ava argued that she's a better singer than Scarlett and that Scarlett sings all the time. I was done with her bullshit so I asked her how many times someone other than her dad has actually asked her to sing, not even paying her to be there, just ask her to sing or how many performing arts schools she's gotten accepted to (she's applied to many). She started to cry and my husband wants me to apologize for being rude to her and is insisting I allow her to eat with the family again. AITA?",

        "selftext": "I (22f) have an older brother (John-32m) who has been with his fianc\u00e9 (Jane-30f) for 4 years. They have a 4 month old. Jane found out she was pregnant at 5 and a half weeks and immediately called my mum to tell her. Mum was confused, but still very excited. Jane said she was going to tell John when he got back from his work trip. A few hours later, she called again, sobbing, saying she has \u2018insatiable cravings\u2019. Mum made a joke like \u2018isn\u2019t it a bit early for cravings?\u2019 and Jane went OFF on her. She started yelling about how this was \u2018her pregnancy\u2019 and no one else\u2019s. It was an odd reaction. she also apologised for her outburst by blaming it on hormones. When my brother returned from his trip, him and Jane left to stay at her mother\u2019s and we didn\u2019t see her until after the baby was born. John said this was because Jane was afraid of losing the pregnancy and wanted to be with her mum and we needed to respect boundaries. Whenever someone would ask about Jane or the baby, they would shut it down with vague answers like \u2018Every pregnancy is different\u2019 or \u2018She\u2019s carrying small, which isn\u2019t unusual\u2019. They barely shared anything about the pregnancy. No ultrasound pictures, no baby shower, and Jane didn\u2019t want anyone around during the delivery. I also discovered that every craving she listed, came from one article about pregnancy cravings (she even listed multiple items in the same order as the article). When the baby was born, we were finally allowed to see Jane and John (and baby of course). It was very bittersweet as we all wished we could have been there for Jane to help out, but Jane and John both reassured us that we did help out by staying away during the pregnancy. The weirdest part though, is how Jane describes the birth. She claims she had an epidural via IV drip into her HAND (edited bc I didn't elaborate--)\u2026 which is NOT how those are administered. When I asked clarifying questions (thinking she had gotten confused, which is understandable) she shut down and refused to answer, like how she would during the pregnancy. She said the baby had 'latching issues' because he was born with no umbilical cord stump. This can technically happen, but it\u2019s a rare and fatal medical condition that their baby does not have. The final straw was when she told us that the baby \u2018basically fell out of her\u2019 within an hour of being in labour, despite my brother telling us how hard the birth was (and even stating that was why they weren\u2019t going to try for any more kids). Mum is on the same side as me, and has been noting this inconsistencies and inaccuracies but doesn\u2019t know how to bring it up. And their reactions don\u2019t help. A few days ago, my brother text mum saying her doubt of Jane is disrespectful and they both want full apologies from the both of us for 'bullying' Jane about her pregnancy/labour. I haven't made any outright accusations about it, nor have I said any of this to Jane. I've only asked questions when she brings the birth/pregnancy up. AITA for having doubts?",

I don't *mind* them, but I do dislike walking up large hills. Walking downhill is the easiest thing ever, it's like being nature's passenger princess. You just put your foot forward and let gravity do all the work. Walking uphill conversely is very draining and leaves me sweaty. I don't make a point to complain about something when I do it, so when I was walking uphill, despite not liking it much, I held basic conversation with my brother.  As we were heading back down, he asked me if I was having fun and I said no. Not because of any fault of my brother, I just didn't find the activity fun. Not even bad, just satisfactory. Later when he was driving me to the airport for my flight home he told me If I ask you if you're having fun, don't say 'no.' I understand that it can be demoralizing to hear someone's not having fun, but I don't like it when people ask for my opinion and get upset when I give my honest answer.

I had Jack with my first wife \u201cPenelope\u201d who passed away when Jack was 9. This hit both of us hard. I thought Penelope and I were going to be together forever. It took me a long time to be ready to date again, which I started doing when Jack was 14. He wasn\u2019t happy about it. I met my first girlfriend, my current wife, \u201cSara\u201d through work. We dated for a few months before birth control failed and Sara became pregnant. Because of that, our relationship progressed very fast. She moved in with Jack and I by the time she was four months pregnant.\u00a0 Jack was understandably very upset, but bother Sara and I wanted our child to grow up in a two parent household. Unfortunately, due to lack of space, we also had to move out of the apartment I shared with my late wife. Jack was put in therapy to help him adjust.\u00a0 However, Jack and I did luck out a bit with Sara. Sara made it a point to have prominent memorabilia of Penelope because of her awful step-mother all but erased Sara\u2019s mother.\u00a0 After Cassie (my daughter) was born, Jack wanted nothing to do with her, which was understandable, but upsetting.\u00a0 However, Cassie\u2019s maternal cousin \u201cWill\u201d (18M)\u00a0 adored her from day one, and happily stepped into that brother role. Frequent hangouts, played with her dolls, etc. He even has a matching (i think) hello-kitty necklace with her, and uses it as his good luck charm for his sport.\u00a0 This was the first year both Jack and Will left for college. Jack messed around during highschool and had crappy grades and no scholarships. While I would be able to pay, I refused to pay 50k/year+ for him to screw around. So, he went to community college for two years and this year transferred to a good school. Will was an A student as well as an excellent athlete, and got an almost full ride to a far away school.\u00a0 Thankfully, both boys were able to come home for Thanksgiving. Jack came home first. She greeted him without much fanfare, but was still happy he was home. This was very different from how she greeted Will. She waited at my SIL\u2019s house for him, made a huge glittery sign, and started bawling her eyes out when she saw him.\u00a0 My sister-in-law posted the video of them reuniting on Facebook, and Jack saw the video and was very upset at the difference in Cassie\u2019s \u201cwelcome home\u201d enthusiasm. After listening to this for the fifth time, I snapped at him and told him these were the consequences of his actions, i.e. doing nothing to make a bond with his sister for the past seven years. He got pissed and stormed off to his room. Since then my former in-laws have been ringing my phone off the hook yelling at me and demanding I reprimand my daughter for her lack of enthusiasm at his return. Cassie doesn\u2019t know why, but she can tell her brother is upset at her and it is affecting her. Will is pissed that Jack is making Cassie upset. I don\u2019t know what to do.\u00a0 ",

        "selftext": "My husband (38M) and I (37F) have been married for 9 years and have 2 kids (8 & 6). He works a hybrid schedule so he's home 2-3 days a week. I'm a nurse at an understaffed hospital. Due to that staffing shortage, I was offered to temporarily switch my work hours to the overnight shift. It came with a nice bump in pay which could really help us out financially. My husband was very much against it because of the changes it would make to our day-to-day lives. I initially declined the offer but they countered with an even higher pay bump, so I took it. It's been 5 months since I changed hours and my husband hates it. My hours are now 10pm-8am M-Thu and midnight-9am Sunday morning. I usually make it home just in time to see the kids off to school, run some errands or get things done at home in the morning, then sleep until the kids' bedtime and head to work. I like to think I've gotten pretty efficient at it since the change, but my husband disagrees. I won't lie, he has had to pick up a lot of kid-related things that we used to share. Pretty much any rides they need are done by him. Any weekday activities he takes care of. Now that the kids are done with school we have them in a summer daycare program and he does all the drop-offs and pick-ups. He's been complaining to me ever since the kids' school year ended that this isn't working for him anymore. He keeps asking when I can switch my hours back. I told him that the original plan was 6-8 months so it could be soon, but it's only been 5 months. If I'm being honest, I don't know if I want to switch back. I'm making and saving a lot more money. Once I adjusted to the sleep schedule, I feel like I actually have more energy and can get more stuff done when I get home from work. This past weekend, my husband practically begged me to ask my supervisor when I can switch my hours back. I finally told him that I'm not sure if I want to do that. He flipped out on me. He told me this isn't what he signed up for when we got married. He told me he feels lied to because not only did I accept the offer without his final approval but now I'm going back on my word that it would be temporary. He said that if I'm going to keep my current night shift, then I need to do more things at home since I have the whole place to myself during the day. I asked him what more he thinks I should do and he actually made a list. He put pretty much all the yard work on there, which is usually stuff he takes care of and that I don't know how to do. I told him I don't know how to do all of that stuff and he told me If I can learn how to fold a fitted sheet, you can learn how to mow the lawn. I told him that doesn't seem like a fair division of labor and he told me that he's taken on all the kid stuff so I need to do more of everything else. I told him that doing manual labor after I worked all night isn't going to work for me and he told me to change my hours back then.",

        "selftext": "I (26M) have 3 kids under 5 (4F, 4F and 2M) with a 4th kid on its way. Before we had kids, my wife  and I had lots of ideas about the parents we were going to be and we had lots of scorn for people who parented in ways we disagreed with but, as any parent knows, actually raising kids is hard work and you will break your values.  My brother (22M) is doing a psychology degree, with a few modules on child psychology and development. He regularly tells me that he thinks ipad kids are spoiled brats who will struggle developmentally and they are the spawn of lazy, negligent parents.  I wouldn't say my kids are ipad kids but they do have an ipad between the 3 of them and more screen time that I would ideally like but sometimes thems the breaks.  My brother also disapproves of the fact we give our kids sweets as bribes (occasionally) and have lied to our kids. Every time he tells me his views on parenting I just laugh and tell him to try being a parent, then I'll take his advice.  Recently, due to an emergency, my wife and I needed a babysitter for a whole day so I called my brother because, despite his judgement, he is actually very good with our kids.  When we got home in the evening the kids were in bed having had dinner and we thanked him profusely. He very ernestly told us that, now he had experienced being a parent, he realised that not letting your kids use screens was very easy and they hadn't watched TV or used their ipad in the 12 hours he'd been there. He also said he'd calmed their fears (they had been aware of the emergency a little bit), read to them, not had to bribe them to do anything with sweets and he'd dealt with very calm relaxed children, as opposed to the brats they normally are when they're with me (his words). He gave us a 20 minute lecture about our bad parenting and now that he was in a position to give advice he was going to give it.  We'd been planning on giving him \u00a3200 to thank him for doing this for us short notice and looking after the kids for so long but we sent him on his way without any pay.  the next day I called him up to tell him I thought his behaviour was incredibly inappropriate, that I appreciated him looking after the kids but it was better he didn't see them for a while and that him springing that all on us especially after a day of stress showed how immature he really was. I told him that he actually didn't know anything about parenting because he wasn't a parent. I concede I may have gone too far but my mum called me up later to tell me my brother was crying and she called me a dickhead because he was just trying to help and apparently I'm a bad parent for dealing with peoples kindness so rudely. My brother and parents are pissed off at me and not talking to me so AITA? ",

He's like ten years older than me, doesn't live at home, yada yada. Anyway we're going on our family vacation in a week. I was allowed to invite a friend. I invited a friend from my dance class - we've gotten pretty close recently. I told her we'd be sharing a room with Vik. She was fine and we started planning our trip. Anyway yesterday my friend came over - she's never met Vik, obviously, and our parents wanted her to meet him before we fly because he'll basically be responsible for us (our parents pair the kids off so they get to relax). When she got introduced to him she immediately, like, freaked out, and told me she no longer wanted to go and got her parents to tale her straight back home. I was obviously upset and I didn't know what had happened. She called me later and said shebwas upset because I'd never told her Vik is a man. I was confused because like, yeah, I'd never outright called him a man but I've definitely called him he before and referred to him as my brother. I said this to her and she told me she never called me call him he (blamed my accent) and that she assumed brother meant my other brothers (I have seven). She told me she doesn't feel comfortable sharing a room with a grown man for a week and no longer wants to come. I'm really, really upset, but feel like if it was that big of a deal for her she should have asked? I told her she was being unreasonable. Like, fair enough she shouldn't go if she's uncomfortable, but it's not my fault she didn't ask. She thinks I should have been upfront about it. My parents think I'm being mean, my brothers are divided. So AITA?",

        "selftext": "Throwaway account for personal reasons. I (F45) have a 14-year-old daughter, who I'll call Mikaela. Mikaela has barely hit puberty and is less developed than the majority of her peers, which I believe is something she is self-conscious about. Last week, my husband and I received an email from Mikaela's school saying that because it was approaching the summer, it would now be mandatory for all students to shower after PE. I understand the logic; Mikaela does PE before lunch and if she doesn't shower, she'll be sweaty for the rest of the day, which I don't believe is hygienic. The school requested that we pack a towel and any shower gel for the next PE lessons to ensure the students were ready. When I mentioned this to Mikaela, she said she would refuse to shower. Since the showers are communal, she told me she did not want to be naked in front of everyone else and would just get dressed. I told her she couldn't do this as the school were enforcing it, plus I felt it was healthy for her to shower. Again, she asked me to email the school to say she wouldn't be participating, but I refused to do so. On Friday, despite many protests, I managed to make Mikaela go to school with her towel/shower stuff packed. I felt like I was doing the right thing. However, when Mikaela got home, she'd been crying all day saying how she'd had to get naked in front of everyone to shower and she'd never been so embarrassed because she saw one or two of the girls laughing at her. I told her how sorry I was and that teenage girls are horrible and that she's beautiful, but for hygiene reasons, she still has to shower. I suggested bringing in a swimming costume to wear to shower in, but she said that would bring even more attention to her. She begged me to email to school to not let her shower, but I said I had no good reason to, and I'm sure all of the other girls feel the same. She told me she hated me and has barely spoken to me the rest of this weekend. My husband feels I should send an email as it doesn't hurt and Mikaela is clearly bothered, but I don't think it's a big deal, she will eventually get over it, and it's important for hygiene reasons.

We were supposed to take two flights, one that would arrive in France, and a connecting flight that would fly to the UK. However, the second flight ended up being cancelled. The next available flight wasn\u2019t until 2 pm the next day, so we would have to wait around 17 hours. The passengers were allowed to stay in nearby hotels for free. However, this didn\u2019t apply to people like my friend, who wasn\u2019t legally allowed to leave the airport because she didn\u2019t have a visa for Europe. Instead, she had to stay within a specific area of the airport that had these bright ceiling lights that would stay on 24/7. There was construction nearby, so there was this extremely loud drilling noise every so often. All the available seats were taken by other passengers, so my friend had to sleep on the floor. Plus, earlier that day, water got spilled on our phone chargers, and her phone was only on 40%. I had the option to stay with her, but I chose to go to the hotel instead. She was furious with me, accusing me of being a fake friend. She told me she was scared of being alone in a creepy unknown place and wanted me there to comfort her, and I assured her that I\u2019ll be back by the morning. She said I was acting selfish for not even spending one night with her, but I hadn\u2019t gotten any sleep in over 24 hours, and I didn\u2019t see why both of us had to suffer. AITA?",

        "selftext": "A few months ago, a friend of mine told me she was getting married, it wasn't meant to be a regular wedding but more of an elopment kind of thing. We were supposed to be her, the groom, me (as a Maid of Honor) and a Best man, plus a few close family member, about 10 people in total, and it was planned for early November.  I say wedding like that in the title because there will be no invites, no save the date, no ceremony, no walk down the isle, just courthouse and dinner (that comes from the bride herself, I'm not guessing anything).  A week ago I got the news that I had gotten a permanent job, I don't know how to explain it because this is a very typical thing from my country, Spain, where  every  so often, the government will hire professionals to work either in the administration or in public institutions (education, highschool...) This is usually a great opportunity because these positions are for life (well, until you retire) and they can never fire you. In order to apply for these positions, you have to take an exam, and then depending on your years of service to the institution and the score you get on the exam, you can get one of those jobs.  Long story short, I took my exam last year and last week I got told that I got one of the jobs, but I will be moving cities for that.  When I told my friend this, the only thing she said is when are you leaving?? Can you still come to my wedding? No congratulations, no i'm happy for you, nothing.  I must add, two weeks ago I talked to her to know where were we having dinner for her wedding, and she said she didn't have anything planned yet, let alone booked. Had she told me she had everything booked and that she really needed my RSVP,  i would've understood her answer, but in that context, I've decided that if the only thing she cares about is her and her wedding, and she can't be happy for me, I'm not going to the wedding.

I don't know her opinion at all, for all I know she doesn't want the car. Also this is in a comment hat got downvoted to hell I just bought myself a new car, this leaves me with an extra car which I was doing to sell back to my dealership. It\u2019s is a Toyota Corolla 2018 which is in good condition. My sister asked if I would be willing to sell it to my niece. She is going to college in a few months and she will needs a car. My niece ( I am going to call her Luna)  has always been a social shy person. I haven\u2019t seen her much, I just moved back to my home state I told them I can bring it by to look at it. I get to their home and my sister and Luna were waiting. I start to show them the car and giving the basic information. I ask who will be buying it and my sister answers. She tells me that Luna is buying it and it will be in her name So I start speaking my to her or at least trying to.  Ever question I asked her, her mom would answer.  For example, I asked her how much she saved up? Her mom answered. I ask how soon would she need the car? Her mom answered. I have heard like five word the whole time I have been here and it was when she was talking to her mom. I ask if she is interested in the car and her mom answer.  I told my sister I asked Luna and wait for Luna to respond. I repeat the question and she doesn\u2019t give an answer and just looks at her mom. I inform both of them I am not willing to sell my car if the person buying it can not communicate with me.  So I ask again what she thinks of the car, she turns around and walks inside. I informed my sister I will not be selling Luna the car. We get into an argument that I shouldn\u2019t have put her on the spot and I know she is shy. I point out that it her daughter can not communicate and she will be eaten alive at college . I told her I will be willing to sell it to Luna if she contacts me. My sister called me a jerk  Update: I received a call form dad ( my Bil). I don't know what is going on in that family but he made it very clear to not sell the car to anyone ( I wasn't going to anyways)  In short Luna can not afford it and they are on debt. I don't know the specifics of what is happening so I am going to stay out of that. I will be selling my car to the dealership ",

Don't know the stress of the morning shift. I have literally done it for 2 years. She is the one that wanted the morning shift because of her schedule For everyone saying have you asked what is wrong, yes she doesn't give an answer  I need an outisde opinion to this. My wife and I have two kids that are both in daycare. My wife will take the morning shift, which includes getting the kids up, getting breakfast and to the daycare. I handle the night shift which is getting the kids from daycare, doing dinner and starting to get them ready for bed. Usally she gets home around 6:30-7 and the whole family has like 30 minutes together before the kids bedtime. We usally spend reading to them. She has to travel an hour+ ( depends on traffic)to work each way.  So the kids are getting at daycare at 8 in the morning and I will pick them up around 4. I work from home and start around 7 and end around 3-3:30. The issue is around brekafast, we agreed that I would make dinner each night and she does breakfast. She already makes food for the kids so it's literally just making an extra one of what she is already making.  For the past month she will either not make it at all for me, not tell me that it is done ( I have asked her to just give a general time but she keeps switching up the schedule).

I have talked to her multiple time and explained that it is not considerate.  We got into an argument and she told me I am home so just make my own food. I explained I may be home but I am doing my job. Yesterday she didn't make anything and I had enough. She came home and I didn't make her anything for dinner. When asked I told her she is home and can make her own food. This started a huge argument and she called me a jerk. ",

Even on our two salaries, my husband and I wouldn\u2019t ever be able to afford a home like this, even though we are pretty frugal and have savings. The housing market if tough, and we were extremely fortunate. My half sister Ella 25F from my dad and I are very close, and she landed a new job in the city centre. On her salary, she can\u2019t afford to rent a place in the city centre area, and living on the outskirts and paying for a train there and back isn\u2019t cost effective.  She asked me if she could move in, as this was her dream industry and although the pay wasn\u2019t great it was for experience and once she\u2019d saved enough she could get on her own feet.  Ella got laid off around Christmas, and had been trying really hard to find work, so I offered her the guest bedroom. She said she\u2019d help around the house.

I called her to tell her boss that she needed 20 minutes to pick up her niece after a family emergency, and then she could continue.  Ella argues that she still had to work for the rest of the day and she didn\u2019t have to time to babysit her niece. I told her that I expected her to help around the house when she moved in, and she said that she wasn\u2019t free labour.  There\u2019s tension in the house now, and I wanted a second opinion.

        "selftext": "I adopted my son when he was born. It was an open adoption but the birth mom (Beth) was so greatly ashamed of being a teen mom that she didn't follow up on any contact. Which was fine because I had no intention of involving her too much.  The truth is that Ethan grew up with two dads and three older brothers. We always try to have him spend time with girls. A couple of years ago when Ethan was 9, Beth reached out to see how he was doing. I think she spent the last nine year being an overachiever so she'd feel worthy of having a relationship with Ethan. Ivy league, married a hedge fund dude, yoga, etc. Ethan is incredibly self aware and intellectual. You cannot bullshit him so he and I enjoy a very open relationship. I told him his mom reached out to me and asked about him. I emphasized that she didn't forget him but she had to go away to work on herself. I asked how'd he feel about talking with her and he said he was open to it.  They have a good relationship and spend time together. He's met her husband. It's been a good thing to know his bio family.  Ethan is starting 6th grade and he has to pick an elective class. There has been arguments about what that class will be. Anyways,he told Beth about it and she fucked up by getting involved with the matter. She said what's the big deal about his doing yearbook. He should do what he wants to do. It's his class. I was like you got me fucked up. I said girl you are not his mom. You're more like a siblings and siblings don't get a say in parenting decisions. You take a backseat. You're a seat filler in the life of Ethan. Just don't forget your place.  She didn't say anything and went radio silent. I was the bigger person and reached out. I said I've been raising that kid for 11 years so it was triggering for you to give your two parenting cents. You need to understand that. He understands that so you should too.  I guess she's waiting for ME to apologize for something she did. I will not. Once you do that then everything goes bad.",

        "selftext": "So I recently found out that my boyfriend has been buying and drinking raw (unpasteurized) milk. He grew up on a farm and apparently his family always drank it straight from the cow, and he's been doing the same ever since we moved in together. At first I didn\u2019t think much of it (being a vegan I never drank it myself) but I started doing some research after I saw the label on it literally says not for human consumption. Apparently raw milk can carry harmful bacteria like salmonella, E. coli, and listeria. I freaked out when I read that, I don't want him to get sick or expose me to something dangerous. So, when I saw a fresh bottle of raw milk in our fridge yesterday I panicked and poured the entire bottle down the drain. I thought it was the safest thing to do. When my boyfriend got home he immediately noticed and was pissed. He said he spent a lot of money on that milk and that he\u2019s been drinking it for years without a problem. He accused me of not trusting him and said I had no right to throw away something he enjoys just because I disagree with it. I tried explaining that I was just concerned for his health and ours, but he said I was being a control freak. Now he's barely talking to me and I feel like there\u2019s this huge distance between us. AITA for pouring out the milk? I thought I was doing the right thing but I'm starting to wonder if I overstepped.",

        "selftext": "My niece Jay(10F) was the only Granddaughter when my mother died in 2020. When she died, she wanted my niece to have her porcelain doll collection which had around 6 dolls. These porcelain dolls were around when I was a child and I had memories of getting in trouble for playing with them. They were absolutely beautiful. Well, when my mother died I (29F) decided to keep ONE doll, I know it wasn\u2019t left to me, but I felt like they meant more to me than they could to my niece. I contemplated giving it back to her when she was old enough to appreciate it. We\u2019re from Louisiana and hurricane Laura hit \u2026 when we evacuated. I took the doll with me because I knew it was sentimental and irreplaceable. My niece, however let all of the remaining five dolls get ruined in hurricane because she let them in the house when where got ruined. My twin sister (Jays mom) thanks that it\u2019s only fair that I give Jay the doll. I kept safe because after all it was left for her\u2026. My argument is that if I would have gave her the doll, it would have gotten ruined with the other ones because she didn\u2019t care enough about them to take them her with her. Fast-forward, we are now in 2025 and I have a daughter of my own. I 100 % believe if my mom would have known she was gonna have another granddaughter she would have left a doll to her. AITA? ",

        "selftext": "I (35F) am a single mother to 2 kids (5 & 3).  Both my kids are in daycare and over the years I have built a solid friend group with a handful of other moms and our kids regularly get together for play dates.  The father of my kids is not in the picture at all and my relationship with him is non-existent.  This is 100% for the best and I am currently in therapy to deal with a lot of things that my ex did to me.  This friend group has literally been a lifesaver for me at times.   A few months ago, there were 2 new kids that started at our daycare center.  They are similar in age to my kids and were placed in the same classes as them.  I noticed that their dad was the only parent to ever pick up or drop off the kids.  He would try to make small talk with me a few times, but I am uncomfortable around strange men so I would be polite, but not engage further than that.   Our mom group has a group chat that we use to support each other and arrange play dates.  A few weeks ago, one of the moms texted the group chat that she was adding this new dad to our group chat because he wanted to have his kids participate in play dates outside of daycare.   I privately texted that other mom and told her that I don't feel comfortable with a man I don't know having my contact information and told her that she should have consulted all of us before deciding on her own to add him to our group chat.  I then texted the rest of the moms and told them that I want them to keep a separate group chat without the other dad because I don't know him and it makes me uncomfortable.   This resulted in a lot of divided opinions with about half of the moms agreeing to a separate chat and the other half saying that would be too difficult to keep track of and that it is wrong to exclude another parent just because he's a man and that I'm being unreasonable.   The mom I texted privately replied to me that she has talked with this dad numerous times and that he seems like a nice person and good parent and that his kids shouldn't be excluded if they want to hang out with their friends outside of daycare.  She told me I am being difficult and making this all harder than it needs to be.   The other day when I picked up my kids, my 5-year-old was upset because a bunch of his friends were talking about a playdate that he wasn't invited to.  I texted the moms about it and they said that they were getting the kids together with the new dad and didn't invite my kids because of how I was acting.    I told them it was rude to exclude my kids like that and a couple of the moms told me to grow up because that's exactly what I was trying to do to this dad and his kids.   I'm at a loss because these moms have been so supportive to me in the past and as soon as this dad comes into the picture it's like they pulled a 180 and don't seem to care at all.  There are still other moms who agree with me, but now it's like our friend group has been divided by this.  ",

We have a big age gap but are still quite close and she is basically like another parent for me, and we got much closer when our mom died when I was 14. Kara basically raised me and is very overprotective, but in the past I have asked her to give me some space. I have always been career focused and dated casually and nothing long term. Most my friends are married and some with kids so we are all at different life stages. My one and only serious relationship beyond 2 months was with my ex fianc\u00e9 Ted however we broke up last year. I struggled to move on and only started recently casually dating, but I miss Ted so I can\u2019t commit to anything. Kara helped me through the break up, but she wanted me to get back together with Ted as she really liked him and even suggested that I pass up the job for him. Kara really wants me to settle down like she has and I just think we are too different in that. She is a SAHM to 3 kids and basically raising a fourth as her husband doesn\u2019t lift a finger around the house and will kick up a fuss if the house is messy or there\u2019s no food on the table. I don\u2019t like my BIL at all, and have encourage Kara to discuss with him about getting him to help out around the house. Kara called me again last night to encourage me about starting to date again, and that she set up a blind date for me and honestly I feel that\u2019s the only thing we\u2019ve spoken about for the past few weeks. She said she just wanted me to be happy like she is, but I then told her that her life is my biggest nightmare. She got upset and said I was being too harsh. ",

She is a freshman and has been with her boyfriend Steve for 3 years. Steve is really a great kid, but since money is a bit tighter in his family, he is doing 2 years at junior college while working to save up for the school my daughter attends. We have never taken him on a trip, but since he says money is right, we decided to bring him with on our visit to see our daughter. He visited her once on his own back in the fall, but due to his finances he wouldn\u2019t be able to afford another trip this school year. He was over the moon when we invited him.  We don\u2019t want him to pay for a single thing. His flight, his hotel room (he will be sharing with our son, they get along really well) and his food and drink will all be paid for by us. And really we are glad to do it. We\u2019ve also never really had a disagreement with Steve until now.  When speaking to my daughter about plans, the hotel came up. This is when I found out that my daughters dorm roommate is out of town that weekend. And she plans to have Steve stay in her dorm with her while we visit. I told her absolutely not. I said what they do when we aren\u2019t there is their business, but since we are going to be there and funding this whole trip, he will be staying at the hotel. Call my husband and I old school, or traditionalists, but we are Christians. And the idea of them staying together on our visit makes us uncomfortable. We think we are being rather generous to take him in the first place.  The word got back to Steve and he actually called me and asked why he couldn\u2019t stay with our daughter. I explained my reasons above and he got irate. He tried to pull the \u201cadult\u201d card. I said Steve,  here is the deal. If you wanna stay with her, that\u2019s fine. You will still be welcome to tag along with our family. But there will be separate checks on every meal. And he could figure out his own way there. He said we know he can\u2019t afford that. And I said all we ask is that you sleep at the hotel. He agreed but now my daughter is saying we embarrassed him and he\u2019s thinking of not coming.",

A couple of weeks ago, she told me she likes to get Chinese food on Black Friday because her family used to do that, and it\u2019s a tradition she doesn\u2019t get to do anymore. Initially, I dismissed it, saying we should eat leftovers since my mom likes us to stick around and eat with everyone. I also didn\u2019t want to leave others out. But she convinced me it was important, so I told my mom on Wednesday night that we wanted to go out on Friday. My mom was visibly upset. I looked to my girlfriend and asked if we could move it to Sunday instead. She agreed. Fast forward to Friday around 4:30 pm, and she told me she was upset that I didn\u2019t care about her feelings. I was confused because I thought we had resolved it by moving it to Sunday. She said she still wanted to go out on Friday, so I said, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d But then she said she didn\u2019t want to go anymore because she had eaten a big breakfast. I suggested we get takeout later, but she said it was fine, and we didn\u2019t go. Later in the car, she had a mature conversation with me about needing to learn how to let things go, and I thought that was the end of it. However, this morning (Sunday), she brought it up again and said she was still upset that I \u201cdismissed her feelings.\u201d She also revealed that this tradition is tied to her late grandfather, who passed away three years ago, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s so meaningful. She said she thought we were making fun of her for wanting Chinese food, which we weren\u2019t. I told her I wished she\u2019d said something earlier because we absolutely would have gone if I\u2019d known how important it was to her. She says she\u2019s not mad at me now, but I still feel like she is. She also said I should\u2019ve \u201cread between the lines.\u201d I feel like I tried to make it work on Friday and genuinely thought we had a plan for Sunday. Did I mess this up? AITA?

        "selftext": "I F(24) dabble in photography quite often as for a career I design clothing and model it to save costs. So when my brother Jake M(21) asked me to photograph his wedding, I of course agreed. My brothers wife, Chelsea(22) is a very kind woman, however her stylistic choices can sometimes be a bit wild. I do not judge at all because I know innovation is part of self expression. Chelsea showed me her wedding makeup, and she had these vibrant green contacts on. They looked extremely reptilian on her due to it not matching her undertone. When she showed me the picture, I told her she looked lovely, but that the contacts weren't the best. She seemed a bit offended, and told me she just wanted to look exotic like you. I offered to find her some more natural contacts but she wouldn't relent. On her wedding day, as I took pictures, the contacts looked even worse, like a neon green light up sign. When Jake was free for a moment, I showed him a few pictures. He called Chelsea over, and she seemed to be happy with the pictures, while Jake seemed a bit iffy. Chelsea asked what I thought, and I told her she looked stunning, but I then asked if she'd like me to edit the contrast a bit in the pictures. She then got extremely defensive, and accused me of calling her ugly on her own wedding day. Of course that was not my intention, but I left early to prevent a scene.   Edits to answer some questions:   1. The bride was not being racist with the exotic comment, English is her second language, I just look unconventional.   2. I left the wedding at 1am instead of 3, they had lots of pictures taken by me   3. I asked her about the edits at the wedding itself as she wanted them posted ASAP on my account and hers. I didn't want her to receive rude comments from our relatives, my followers or anything like that, but I also didn't want her to be edited without consent.   Finally, here is what the contacts looked like, [https://www.moonfunmakeup.com/en-ca/products/silken-green-natural-contact-lenses](https://www.moonfunmakeup.com/en-ca/products/silken-green-natural-contact-lenses)",

I was assigned this randomn group project partner (20F) and we were working on a project for most of the semester. We had decided to organize the project in a way that she would do core parts and I would do plug-in modules that depend on her core. However since she did her parts in a convoluted way, it was hard for me to understand it and when I couldn't get it to work she had to do them as well. We got into an argument and she claimed it wasn't convoluted. I then paid a tutor who advised me and said he could help but that the project would be easier to do in rust compared to c++. She agreed to redo the project in rust if I converted everything we had so far myself and she'd help out with the last part. We got permission from the prof to do it in rust instead. The tutor then helped me convert her code to rust and which counted as my part.  However when it finally came to doing the last part she said she had no time to work with me on it as she didn't know rust well enough and had some ballet competition the weekend of the deadline. She offered to finish it in the C++ version but I told her it is OK. I then got it done with the help of the tutor and submitted the project. Since the rust code was all written by me in the statement of contribution I had to state that I did all the code and she contributed to the design process and report. However the prof took that as her not contributing as only the code is actually graded and decided to give her a 0 on the project which would lead to her failing the class as it is 70% of the grade.  She now wants me to come talk to the professor with her and is upset at me for refusing. The way I see it it is not really my problem and I don't want to face any trouble and she did already tell the prof that she had done the older c++ code we didn't submit. AITA here? She's pretty upset at me and seems to blame me when it is the profs decision.",

        "selftext": "My fianc\u00e9 and my wedding invites have started arriving, along with the invites is a few things we felt we should outline before the guests arrive to the reception. We have decided to not include an open bar. I come from an alcoholic heavy family and simply don't feel comfortable being around people who are drinking heavily. Instead, my fianc\u00e9 and I have decided to have a drink ticket like service instead. With that service we've been able to customize how we want alcoholic beverages being handled at our reception and the venue says this kind of service happens all the time there, it was their suggestion in fact, so I didn't think it would be this big of a deal. With the invitations was a card with the expectations one is to expect from the ceremony and the reception. I didn't want to shock people when they arrived so I figured the cards would be a nice, classy heads up for our guests. The drink service bit of the card said, essentially, that alcoholic drinks were limited to two per of age guest, the tickets are non-transferable, and like the other beverages offered would need to be ordered from your seat at your assigned table. Drinks were also to be enjoyed at your assigned table. I've been called a lot of rude things after family (both sides) and friends are receiving their cards. My fianc\u00e9 has as well but a little less so. The most common being bridezilla but I did have an uncle reach out to me and say I'm an a-hole for trying to, spoil the fun of a wedding reception. The response has been mostly negative and has been from all sides of family and friends and now my head is swirling as I try to figure out what to do.  So, AITA because I've set my reception up like this and am not offering an open bar instead?",

Basically my daughter(13) gets really bad periods the same as her mother, which I\u2019m very knowledgeable about i grew up with 6 sisters and have been with my wife for nearly 18 years.

It makes me glad that he wants to help her but he cannot do everything for her. When I brought this up to my son my wife became very angry at me and said I was going to discourage our son and o should be proud he\u2019s learning early. I said although I am proud, I feel he\u2019s being taken advantage of. He can help grab things for her if he wishes but going so far to adjust ac, the tv volume, getting up at her every call is a bit far.

        "selftext": "My (27F) fiance (29M) is an extremely picky eater, and lately, I\u2019ve been feeling really frustrated with his extreme pickiness when it comes to food. He has a very limited diet and refuses to try anything outside of his comfort zone. He doesn't eat meat or vegetables, his diet typically consists of stuff like pizza, macaroni, cereal, and bread with the occasional fruit on the side. This has made it extremely frustrating whenever we eat out. If we're getting something to eat, we have to only go to places that serve anything he wants, which limits our options to mostly just fast food or pizza places. He's offered to go out to other restaurants with me, but he never ends up ordering anything when we do and it's extremely embarrassing. He never eats anything I cook, and typically just sticks to making his own food. This came to a head when we visited my parents last week. We sat down to eat together, they know he doesn't eat meat so prepared a vegetable dish. When we were eating, he only ate a small portion of it, and I could tell from how little he had eaten he wasn't going to finish it. My parents asked what was wrong, and he thanked them for the food, but said he just wasn't that hungry and ended up just fiddling with the rest of it and threw most of it out after dinner. I was mortified. On the way back, he wanted to stop and get food and I kind of laid into him. I told him he embarrassed me, was rude to my parents to not eat the dish, and that he seriously needs to grow up and stop eating like a manchild. This isn't the first time we've had an argument about this, but it is the first time I've been this mad. Last summer we visited my extended family at my uncle's lakehouse, and he basically only ate frozen pizza and cereal the three days we were there, which caused issues since my nieces and nephews were there and I felt it set a bad example for them. He got really hurt and hasn't talked to me much for the past few days. I feel bad, but at the same time, I'm just tired of this. So, AITA? I feel I could have been nicer and more accomodating, but it's not like he has a medical condition that forces him to eat this way. I'm just so tired with him not even being willing to try and continuing to eat like a 5 year old.",

A couple weekends ago my girlfriend and I decided to take a walk by the beach and grab some ice cream. We spotted an artist doing cartoonistic drawings of people/couples and figured we'd get one of ourselves. The couple before us got a relatively cute (a bit boring imo) looking cartoon of the two of them but I knew that with these guys the only guarantee is that the outcome is unpredictable. So yeah, my guy starts drawing us while we just kept talking and eating our ice creams. He eventually finishes and shows us the drawing and it looks SICK AF! I so wish I could upload it so you could see what I'm talking about but that would obviously be a bad move seeing how she feels about it.  I've got big ass ears so in the cartoon i'm like a hybrid human dumbo and my girlfriend looks more realistic (like herself) but her nose has been egregiously exaggerated. She has a **slightly** bigger nose than normal but its only noticeable when its pointed out/actively compared with others. Anyways, I figured she hated it when she was silent during the reveal then walked off. I paid the man for his work, took the art then went after my girlfriend. She explained in the car that he basically reignited her insecurity over her nose and didn't want to see. Alright cool, understood but I already paid for it so I just kept it in my cubicle at work. Long story short, she saw that the art was in my cubicle and we got in a tiff about that because I apparently shouldn't have kept it after she told me how it made her feel. I said she was being ridiculous since its in my cubicle and couldn't just throw it away. Aita?",

Her family is much bigger than mine and she wants more of a party type wedding, with lots of music and dancing. My family is all a bit older than hers (she is the oldest sibling while I am the youngest), and they aren't into big, loud weddings. They would prefer something quiet and more focused on socializing, and I would too.  My fiancee said we could do an extended cocktail hour and/or start the reception later so there would be more time for quiet socializing, or even start the whole wedding earlier in the day so it wouldn't go as late. She also suggested that we could take our wedding photos before the ceremony so that we wouldn't have to miss cocktail hour to do them.  I suggested that instead, we find a venue with two separate rooms. That way her family could have a louder party in one, and mine could have a quiet reception in the other. It would be in the same venue so each side could still go over to the other to socialize.  My fiancee said she actually really hates that idea. She said she feels like that defeats the purpose of a wedding, which is supposed to symbolize the union of two people and their families. She also said she doesn't want to do that because she worries I'll spend the entire reception with my family and that she'll have to chose between spending the night with me but ignoring her family, or being with her family but us basically being separate at our wedding. She also said she feels like the wedding we're planning is becoming less and less ours and more mine. She said this because she originally wanted a child-free, non-religious wedding but compromised on a church ceremony with children allowed because that is what I want.  AITA? ",

Each of us had distinctly different stir fry meals. We each got to-go boxes, and my wife asked that we label who's is who's. I told her we didn't need to do that because I could tell the difference because mine had banana peppers, my kid had two different types of noddles, and my wife's had neither multiple types of noodles nor banana peppers. The following day, my wife was away and the kid and I ate our leftovers leaving alone what I thought were my wife's. The next day, my wife notices that her stir fry is gone. Apparently, her leftovers also had the two types of noodles that we originally only discussed my kid had. When my kid and I ate our leftovers, I pulled out the first two to go boxes, saw one had banana peppers and the other had two types of noodles and figured those were ours. My wife is bummed because she was really looking forward to the leftovers and jokingly upset at me now. She tells me I was wrong for saying we didn't need to label the leftovers. She said I should have opened all 3 to go boxes before eating any leftovers. So Reddit, AITA for not opening up all 3 to go boxes before the kid and I ate our respective food?

I moved to London a few months ago and my friend Eleanor from uni was nice enough to introduce me to her group of friends since she grew up here. I\u2019ve spent a lot of time with her friends and they\u2019re slowly becoming my friends too. We spend most weekends together and we even took a spontaneous weekend trip to Spain last month.  There\u2019s this guy in the group who is ridiculously attractive but Eleanor warned me he wouldn\u2019t be interested when I first told her about my crush. She honestly made me think he was gay the way she said it and he always ignores the female attention he gets on nights out so I really did think he was gay. He also doesn\u2019t wear a wedding ring and he\u2019s never brought his wife when we go out, not even when we went to Spain so I was shocked yesterday when I saw him walk over and touch a woman sitting with his best friend\u2019s wife. I asked one of the girls who she was and she told me she was his wife. I was shocked so I blurted out \u201cTHAT\u2019S his wife\u201d? I didn\u2019t mean anything bad about it but I guess my tone showed how shocked I was and Eleanor misunderstood so told me to shut up. The girl I asked was also giving me weird looks so maybe my tone wasn\u2019t what I intended. Eleanor dragged me away from the other girl to tell me not to say anything about his wife because supposedly he\u2019s ridiculously protective over her and the group would quickly turn against me if the guy thought I was saying something negative about his wife which I think is super dramatic. I tried to explain I thought he was gay and that\u2019s why I was shocked but Eleanor thinks I\u2019m lying so she keeps telling me to just be nice to his wife and not say anything bad about her because it would cause problems for her too. I really think she\u2019s being dramatic. Its not like I said she was ugly\u2026 I was just shocked he was married. During the night Eleanor went out of her way to introduce me to his wife but I didn\u2019t say much because Eleanor had made it so awkward for me that I didn\u2019t want to say the wrong thing. She was also really quiet so it was hard to have a conversation with her, especially since her husband or his friend\u2019s wife were always hovering around her.

I will go to At Home tomorrow and buy her the same candle and put it back atop the toilet. If you\u2019ve read anything I\u2019ve said I have certainly learned my lesson about leaving candles unattended. I will also apologize and ask that she either cut off the wicks or tell me when she has a candle she doesn\u2019t want used as this is a first time thing. We\u2019re fine. Since this candle is already \u201cruined\u201d however, I will be damned if I don\u2019t burn the rest of that fucker down to bottom, after trimming the wicks of course.  Final edit: it IS a fucking candle, like a candle candle. I\u2019ve been at work all night but I got home and just looked at the bottom. Instructions say \u201ctrim wick to 1/4\u201d before lighting\u201d. I did not do this as being the apparent caveman I see candle, I light candle. She\u2019s asleep so I can\u2019t rub it in her face after she said \u201cthat candle isn\u2019t supposed to be lit, they\u2019re not meant for that\u201d, but this is all I need. Am I the asshole for leaving it lit for a quick piss walk before bed with her and the dogs YES. Am an asshole for thinking this stupid thing was in fact a candle NO. The cutting the wick thing was ignorance for not thinking the protective lid that usually comes with a plastic peel around it would\u2019ve prevented someone from lighting it otherwise and they probably should make the damn things ready to go. Here\u2019s a lesson to anyone out there about to light a candle, apparently they have instructions. I now know she was wrong and we never got into a major fight so I will humbly and in the least petty way just leave the candle upside down next the sink so when she wakes up first to brush her teeth she can know that this candle was in fact meant to be lit, and that I was right. I can\u2019t add links or pics here but it\u2019s called Mermaid Shimmer from At Home. I may be dumb but I can hang my hat up knowing I had every right to light it. Good night to all, and have a pleasant tomorrow! Edit 3: holy shit y\u2019all know how to beat a dead horse. I get it, IM AN AH FOR LEAVING THE HOUSE WITH IT. I\u2019ve accepted that. I will be sure to never do it again. Now try imagining the question as in I lit it and sat down on the couch and then it started smoking. AITA then? Gf and I share candles, share a household, and share the financial responsibility for these. They are not \u201chers\u201d they\u2019re \u201cours\u201d. This question was just supposed to be about how in the hell I was supposed to, without being told, know that there was a fake candle I shouldn\u2019t have lit? The label doesn\u2019t even say anything, just \u201chand poured wax. Edit 2: a accept I am the asshole, but still fck those candles Edit: aside from the obvious that I shouldn\u2019t have left with it lit, I take responsibility for that. If all other scented candles are fair game(except if they\u2019re \u201cout of season\u201d, she doesn\u2019t like the house to smell too much like dogs so she likes when I do. The big question here is why tf are there wicks in a decorative candle your going to put above a toilet and not tell me it\u2019s off limits? I went to the bathroom last night and it was stinky. So, being the considerate boyfriend I am I lit the candle my gf left on top of the toilet, and then we went to walk the dogs. The candle looked like most scented candles I\u2019ve seen. Round glass, tan colored wax inside, smelled good, HAD F*ING WICKS. We get back, smoke alarm is going off, house is cloudy but no worse than burning food in the oven. Smokes worse in the bathroom so I blowout the candle and she tells me you\u2019re not supposed to light that candle. WTF, why would it have wicks? Why would she put it on top of the toilet? To me it\u2019s like having a doormat you\u2019re not supposed to step on in front of your door. Do most guys know about this? She seems mad at me, but I told her it\u2019s crazy to do that.

Dinner was going great until we announce we're having a boy and naming him Shawn. My in laws got a little quiet for a moment before my MIL asked if there was any other options we'd considered. We took forever to pick a name, Shawn is the only one we could agree on. MIL told us that that's the name of Ashley's old bully who tormented her heavily in school and online during 2020-2021 and it got so bad she switched schools. It got a awkward after that, there wasn't much else to say and dinner ended quickly after. My MIL texted me and my husband again to again ask us to find a new name for Ashley's sake. Would I be the asshole for not wanting to change it? We were only able to agree on it a few weeks ago. EDIT: we didn't know that was the name of Ashley's bully until my mil told us at dinner, we didn't know before hand and pick it anyway",

Zach is a very lovely boy and very outgoing. When he came in and saw me he says Emily, I didn't know you have 2 sisters. I laughed as even though it's cliche I know he's trying to be nice. The entire time at dinner he was very polite but he is also a very outgoing kid. He would say stuff such as what a lovely dinner, this food is great, your backyard is beautiful, etc, etc. So while you could say he was trying to be overly polite, he was still a very sweet and kind kid. Emily is a more shy and reserved person so I felt they were really great for each other. Emily is also very sweet and positive, another thing they have in common that I appreciated. My husband also hit it off with him and they were engaging in sports banter, and eventually came to trash talking some football team owner. My older daughter (amy,19), however kept grilling the poor guy. Asking if he would pay for dates, to which he said yeah, and then she asks how he has money, and he said his job, then she started talking about making time for Emily, in between school friends and a job. Then it came onto how they would get to dates and she started asking him about his license, she then started to ask about protecting her making comments on his stature (hes on the shorter side and kind of chubby, like 5'7 and maybe a little overweight, nothing crazy however) and he seemed to be getting uncomfortable so I brought out dessert, which he again complimented, and my husband brought up sports to change topics. After he left I asked her why she would do that. She said that he seemed to nice, and cliche, as if he was faking it. I said so people cant be nice these days? You made it weird for him and Emily, Emily didn't deserve that neither did he. She said that she just didn't like that vibe as no-one is that nice or positive it was definetely forced. Emily butted in and said that she really didnt appreciate that and said that Amy's reasoning didn't make sense. Amy said that she didn't care if it was awkward as she wanted to grill him, and that she doesn't like him because he seemed fake. Emily said, that Amy was messed up and I agreed. Amy then said that he was some dumb weak kid faking being nice, and this upset Emily, and me. Emily then said in a fuss You only say that because your single and no one will date you. She has been slightly sensitive about this as she hasn't been in a committed relationship yet.This upset Amy and Amy asked why I didn't say anything or stop her from going to her room. I said that she just insulted her bf and that she deserved it, she told me I should punish her and was being a bad parent and now Amy isn't talking to me and I feel that maybe a personal insult like that was to far.",

I was told that the dress code was smart casual. For context, I wore a nice skirt and button-up, and a pair of crocs. I live in a hot climate and lots of people such as myself wear sandals/crocs/flip flops everywhere. When we got to the restaurant, it turned out they had a dress code, and the hostess loudly told me I couldn't come in wearing crocs. It was extremely embarrassing in front of my coworkers. I don't really understand the problem because there were people wearing sneakers, converse, etc, and that's fine but crocs aren't? It wasn't even a fancy restaurant so I really wasn't expecting this. Anyway, one of my coworkers urged me to go home and change my shoes and come back. I was so distraut I ended up just going home and not coming back. I suffer with anxiety and the whole experience just made me meltdown. My coworkers are now collectively angry at me for leaving and not coming back. My boss told me the event wasn't about me and I should've sucked it up. Was I an asshole for leaving?",

        "selftext": "I understand this is a very sensitive subject and I want to preface by saying I am approaching this as delicately as possible. Any ignorance on my part is not malicious but simply because I don\u2019t know. I (28m) was in a long distance relationship with my gf (25f) for several months before we decided to take the plunge and move in together. She now lives with me. Before she lived with me, we could only visit each other one weekend every month but we called and texted everyday. She moved in with me about 6 weeks ago. For relevant context, I am white and my girlfriend is black. We live a very active lifestyle and we regularly workout, hike, bike, etc. I started to notice that after she would work out and shower, her hair would not be wet and still in braids. I have a sister and I know women don\u2019t always wash their hair everyday so I figured it was that. But then I noticed she still didn\u2019t wash her hair the next week either. Her hair is absolutely beautiful and I love her curls, but whenever I got near her head I could smell that her scalp/hair were dirty and unclean. I personally am very sensitive about smells, especially the smell of a dirty scalp. I have to wash my hair every 1-2 days because I cannot stand the smell of buildup. More time passed and it had now been weeks since my girlfriend washed her hair and while it might be mean to say, I was honestly disgusted. The smell was really bothering me and I brought up the issue to her which caused her to fly off the handle. Granted, I might not have gone about it the best way. I basically asked her point blank when the last time she washed her hair was because it kind of smells bad. She looked at me like I was insane and immediately started calling me racist and ignorant. She informed me black women\u2019s hair is different and doesn\u2019t require frequent washing because it can dry out and damage the follicles. I told her I understand haircare for black women is different, but that doesn\u2019t mean her scalp or hair magically stays clean and doesn\u2019t smell after not washing out the dirt, sweat, oils, and buildup for weeks. This led to her calling me \u201ca dumb fucking racist\u201d and she kept repeating how ignorant and stupid I am. This has really cut me deep because I do not believe I am racist. Ignorant is fair because that is true, I grew up in a predominantly white area and my past girlfriends have all been exclusively white or asian with straight hair texture. I had no exposure and I don\u2019t see why a white guy not knowing about black women haircare is racist. Things with my girlfriend are tense. She has been washing her hair everyday and saying she will blame me for how damaged her hair becomes because I have made her so insecure about the smell. I have apologized profusely but things still aren\u2019t well. I guess I just want an outside perspective.  Edit: For clarity, she did not wash her hair for 5 weeks. This past week she has been washing her hair every day.  Edit 2: For clarity on the conversation, I did not call her \u2018disgusting\u2019 to her face but I felt disgusted by the dirty smell and lack of showering for 5 weeks. I said something along the lines of \u201cHey when was the last time you washed your hair? To be honest it smells a bit bad babe.\u201d",

About 5 years ago our house was finally built, Ella was the one who actually designed our house. We have a loft area above our living room that Ella said was going to be a kids area. \u201cOut of sight out of mind\u201d she said for the kids toys. Ella also suffers from depression and I lot of the house projects she hoped would be done by now aren\u2019t. Personally I think she\u2019s too hard on herself and I do help as much as I can but I also work 60-70 hours a week. Ella has been using the loft area as a reading area, honestly I\u2019m not too sure how much she uses it. I know she read a bit, but mostly when I see her read it\u2019s in bed. Ella has been hard on herself lately, because the kids toys are scattered everywhere so I decided while she was out to have the kids take everything up into the loft area and put all her stuff into her gaming room (we both have our own separate gaming rooms.) The kids LOVE this area and in the time they\u2019ve been playing up there I have seen no toys. Ella came home and started crying saying that was her safe heaven area away from everyone and has been really short with me .She claims that she goes up there everyday and now she can\u2019t just take it away from the kids.  I told her she can make her gaming room into a reading room but she states the kids go in there and it\u2019s not the same. I told her she was overreacting and this is exactly what she wanted this area for so AITA TLDR wife designed house for the kids to have an area in loft, then got made when I made the area a loft area.  Edit: I can\u2019t believe I have to say this but, obviously my wife is not neglecting our children by giving herself time to do her activities. As for our 4 year old, our neighbor watches him about 2-5 hours a day we pay them)  so my wife can bake for her business and just to whatever she wants.  Final edit: I hear you all, I should\u2019ve 100% communicated with her. I also found out she hasn\u2019t used her gaming room in months so I took away her favorite spot of the house. So we will be moving the kids stuff into her old gaming room and I will be making a shelf so she can organize all her books up there. ",

        "selftext": "So I (32F) and my husband (29M) live in an area with an extremely high cost of living. I work a job that pays decently well, which is kind of necessary to live where we do. My husband worked a job for years that paid less than mine did, but was okay overall, though he absolutely hated working there. Around October of last year, my husband managed to get a job in his dream career field. He had been working at it for years, and was really excited about finally getting there. However, it's come with  The big issue is, the pay in his field is abysmal. He works as a freelancer (which is standard in his industry) so his job has zero benefits, and it's a pretty significant pay cut from his old job. We don't have combined finances, and after he took the new job, we had to rearrange how we pay for things to account for his lower income. Previously, he had covered a slightly larger percentage of the expenses due to me having student loans to pay off while he didn't. As it is now, I have to be the breadwinner since his income was basically halved, paying for a larger portion of the expenses. I sat him down recently and told him I felt he needed to quit his job and find a better-paying field because it just wasn't feasible. He got upset, since like I said, this is something he's dreamed of for years and worked really hard to get, which I understand. But I just feel this  isn't fair to me. We've had to cut back on a lot of things and there's not really any sign of a pay increase at this point. I feel like I'm carrying him. He offered to get a part-time job on the side, but I know anything he could get that would be feasible for him while keeping his current job wouldn't provide much. He suggested we move somewhere less expensive, to which I said absolutely not, since we'd have to go quite  a ways to find something in that range and it'd mean ridiculously long commutes to my work and being further away from my family. He offered to have his parents help, which I don't want because it's not a long-term solution. He's extremely upset, and I understand it, because I know he worked hard to get here. If he quit now, it'd basically kill his career and it would be extremely hard for him to get another shot at this job. It's not like we're struggling, which is true, we can pay rent and put food on the table, but I hate feeling like this. I work long days at a rather difficult job, while he works from home doing something he did before as a hobby and only makes half as much money now. My point is that it's not like he has to stop doing what he does altogether, since as I mentioned, he did it as a hobby beforehand, but he's upset because he said this is the only thing he's ever wanted to do career-wise and giving it up now would mean he likely never would be able to make it work. AITA? I understand this is important to him but I'm starting to resent him because I feel like the burden of our finances are being placed on me and we've had to cut back on a lot of things.",

We were all of course very excited to meet both her child but to support her during postpartum and her journey in motherhood.  So we finally got to see her this Friday and everything was going very well, we all enjoyed meeting the group as a whole and motherhood seemed to be finding her well. But then another friend of ours asked her about her birth experience. Sarah told us about it and mentioned that she did not have an epidural. I was a little annoyed as some moms seem to think going through unnecessary much pain is something to brag about, I did not think that Sarah was like this. So I said as a joke \u201cCool, did they give you a medal or should we do that?\u201d. She asked me what that comment was necessary for, and I told her that she knew all of us choose the epidural and shaming us for it is not a good look and that not having an epidural isn\u2019t something to brag about. She told me that it was not her intention to do so, but our friends agreed with me and told her that I was right, if her point wasn\u2019t to bring us down or to brag she could have just avoided to mention it. She just said that she was sorry if she upset us but that she really did not mean it in that way. It became sour so we all decided to leave, I thought she would text us later and apologize but instead her husband sent us a text from her number. He basically told us that Sarah was incredible during birth and would have been with our without an epidural, and that we were the ones shaming her for not having one. We did not respond but instead created another group chat talking about it. What we all agreed on is that she, like many other moms who don\u2019t choose the epidural, didn\u2019t intentionally try to shame us. But that they very often think off themselves as superior, and it was sad that Sarah who is otherwise a very kindhearted person turned out to be this way. We don\u2019t believe we are assholes, but Sarah has not talked with us since and my husband told me that if I thought it was worth ruining a 15 year friendship over then so be it.

So I have been keeping it, even though I really want to share the news with everyone around me. A key detail is that we are currently in long distance: she lives in the same country as her parents, while I am an expat and live alove. She will move in with me and to our new house in one month.  \r  She decided that she would like to tell her parents about her pregnancy before she leaves her home country, so that they can share some of the joy while they are together. This way she can also do one of the ultrasounds with her mother and experience this special connection. This is all understood, and I told her I support her in how she wants to handle the pregnancy information.

She was fine with it) \r  Now to the drama. I asked her if I could also tell my parents, to which she responded that she prefers me to wait for the 12 weeks. By that time we will have moved in together in the country where I live. I said fine, but then she asked me that we reveal the news to my parents together, she and I. \r  I can honestly not tell why, but I would like to tell my parents myself. There are no other grandchildren in our family, and I have been living away from home (like three continents away) for the last 12 years. So, in my mind, I really want to share this with my mom and dad and also have the same \u2018joyous family moment\u2019 like she did.  \r  My wife took it badly.\r  I think she feels excluded or that I do not want her to somehow be part of my family? Which on my part is absolutely not true. I just feel like I do not want this to be a joint announcement sort of situation. I want it to be intimate between me and my parents, and right after, we could all have a joint video call or whatever.  \r  She is very upset.

Somehow it is like I have this righteous feeling of possessiveness over a piece of news/information. I am conflicted. \rAm I the Asshole?  \r  Note: she and my parents do not share a common language and communicate via translator app\r  ",

        "selftext": "My Maid of Honor (29F) found out she's pregnant and due in August. I (29F) live a plane ride away from her. We've been friends for 15 years.  Today my MOH mentioned planning a baby shower in a group chat with me and our other friend, we can call him Ben (29M).  She asked Ben, who is local to her, How can I make sure you can attend the baby shower? He has a demanding job. I have a salary job and it's easy to get time off.  MOH shared she wanted to have her baby shower on a specific long weekend between my wedding (In April) and her due date. I said I'm so sorry, that's [other friend, let's call her Sue]'s wedding. MOH said woof, well I think that's the only weekend I can do it. Not only is it Sue's wedding but I was also planning on going to an event in the wedding's area with another friend, Daisy, who was planning to fly there for the event. I have no other plans the remaining weekends. I said I'd really hate to have to be an asshole and cancel on two people, I'd really appreciate if you did not put me in that position. Perhaps my wording was disrespectful there. My MOH shared that she did not understand why I have an issue cancelling on Daisy, but Sue's wedding she can understand. I explained that if it came down to it, I would cancel both of them for her baby shower, but it just sucks to be in this position.  She made several comments such as my baby shower doesn't revolve around your schedule and Yeah I get being upset about cancelling things, I have to cancel and change things for the next 18 years. I chose to ignore these comments as she has shared she is hormonal and wants people to go easy on her. I asked her to speak to her husband's family about their schedule and let me know to try to de-escalate. She said she didn't understand why I was getting upset at her and I didn't understand where she was coming from. Where she is coming from is that she is guessing this weekend is the only weekend her husband's family is available, and the weather around that time would likely be ideal. That's when I snapped a bit and pointed out that I was ignoring her rude comments and just wanted to work with her because I love her but she doesn't seem to see that effort and asked her to stop attacking me.  From there we did manage to de-escalate, but I still feel hurt that she was not willing to reconsider her plans for me, but had no problem asking Ben about how to make sure he can come. I also feel upset that she doesn't find it significant that I am being expected to cancel plans with multiple people that involve travel. Her opinion is I should have little problem cancelling these other things for her baby shower. I love her, I will, but it still fucking sucks. AITA for telling my MOH to stop attacking me after I told her it'd suck to cancel two large life plans for her baby shower. EDIT: This baby shower is NOT scheduled or confirmed with any of her family. She was throwing out a possible weekend and I shared I was busy. To clarify, if this date was SET and she told me \u201cthis is when it is, it is scheduled\u201d I would not have given her any grief at all.  EDIT2: some commenters have expressed opinion changes with this detail. We have the kind of friendship where I am 100% expected to attend this baby shower, which she considers a major life event. I am wondering if I am the asshole for not wanting to cancel on my other commitments or if she is the asshole for expecting me to cancel these and not being very willing to choose a date I am free, despite completely expecting my presence.  UPDATE: I spoke with my MOH today and we have resolved this conflict. We had a communication breakdown. She does expect me to be there but understands I have commitments. She chose another weekend.

        "selftext": "My (16M) son has been having a streak of bad behavior the past 3 years that I (37M) just cannot handle anymore. For context last year he stole my credit card and spent upwards of 150$ on Call of Duty without my permission. Most recently he broke his TV in a fit of rage after being grounded and he took my car at night to hang out with his girlfriend. I can't take it anymore so I sent him to my older brother who is retired military. In hopes that he could straighten him out. This was two months ago, he calls me sometimes and begs me to come home saying life is like hell over there. He claims my brother works him to death and he has no freedom. I told him that he has to deal with the consequences of his action and to deal with it. Most recently he called my oldest son (18M) and begged him to come home. He asked me about it the other night and I told him not to or he'd be in big trouble. I came home from work a couple days ago and found both my sons in the living room. I was angry at my oldest and scolded him kicking both of them out and sending them to live with my brother. I got a call today from my oldest begging for forgiveness telling me the same thing his brother's been telling me for the past two months. I'm starting to feel bad because I don't want them living in total misery and that's what they make it sound like. I don't know exactly what he's doing to them and it's starting to concern me but I still don't want to let them back in and think they got off scot-free. Am I being TA here?? Update: In light of all the comments I have decided to go get them from my brothers house and bring them back home and figure out what is going on over there. Update 2: So I have the boys. At my brother\u2019s house we had a talk. I found out some interesting stuff. They first apologized for misbehaving. We spoke for a minute and then they got in the car. I asked my brother to tell me explicitly what happened. He told me light workouts and cleaning. When I got in the car and asked the boys. They told me it really wasn\u2019t that bad but they wouldn\u2019t want to go back for extended periods of time. They told me it was bad at first but all in all working out wasn\u2019t so bad once they started. They told me it wasn\u2019t really \u201chell\u201d just more than what they were used to. On the way back we had a talk about new rules and all *seems* to be well. I think we might at least be headed in the right direction for now.",

        "selftext": "I (44m) have two children (18m, 16f.) My ex-wife abandonded the family when my daughter was still a baby. I recently married a woman (42f) with three kids (17f, 14f, 13m.) Their father is still involved in their lives. All of our kids are still in high school, though my son is set to graduate soon. They recently had their spring break. During spring break my wife took her two girls to a major city near us for a Mommy/daughter day. They ate, went to a spa, etc. Before they went I suggested to her that she should include my daughter, but she said no as this was a yearly tradition with just her girls. While she was gone I took my kids and her son out for bowling and mini golf. After her trip with her girls was over, the next day, she took her son out for a Mother/son day where she took him out to see whatever movie he wanted. She and I have been arguing ever since about how she excluded my daughter from her Mommy/daughter day. I think it was cruel. My daughter grew up without a mother and I know it would have meant a lot to her to be included. But my wife says that she was just carrying on old traditions; of spending time with just her girls and then spending time with just her son, and that she'd be happy to start a new tradition with my daughter, but that it needed to be a different thing. She also said I didn't bring your son along with my mother/son time with my son. Why aren't you making an issue out of that? I told her that it was different; that my daughter really needed girl time and that excluding her was hurtful. I still think she should have invited my daughter along; that she should have been made a new part of the tradition. AITA? Edit: To be clear; I don't care about people voting that I'm the asshole. That's why I came here and everyone is entitled to their opinions. I just don't think it's right to downvote me when I answer a question honestly.",

        "selftext": "So basically, wife and I were in a rush to catch our subway train to go to a brunch with my parents at our favorite restaurant. We were already 10 minutes late, and my parents are always super punctual and I didn't want to keep them waiting any longer for us. As we approach the escalator down to our subway platform, I can hear our train approaching. So, I tell my wife that we need to catch the train, and we both hurry down the escalator, me in front of her. When we got to the bottom, I heard the subway door chimes, indicating that the doors were about to close. So, I rushed into the train at the last moment, but my wife was left on the platform of the other side. I thought, okay, well this sucks that I made the train but my wife didn't. But it's not really a big deal because we both know exactly where we are going, and it's only 5 stops away. I will just meet her at the restaurant. (I don't get any cell service underground, so we couldn't communicate with each other) So I arrive at the restaurant alone and greet my parents, who immediately question me about where my wife is. I told them what happened, and they didn't really seem to think much of it. But when she gets there 20 minutes later, she is all angry at me for not getting off the train at the next stop and waiting for her there, then getting on that train and continuing together. It made for a bit of an uncomfortable brunch, because we could all tell there was tension. After the brunch on our way home, she explained why she was mad and then became all short with me and pretty much gave me silence the rest of the way home. By the way, I making this subtle edit 25 days later after this was posted to let you all know that this entire story was completely fabricated. It's based on a real event that happened with my brother many years ago, but he was the one to get on the train and leave me behind. And he did wait for at the next stop when it happened. Thank you all for getting so worked up over something you read on the internet. Anyway, back to the story. My position is that we both knew where we were going and she knew my parents are easily irritated when I arrive late, so why would I have gotten off the train to wait for her unnecessarily? So AITA? Edit: Wow, so many people here just assuming New York is the only city in the world that has a subway... I've never even been to America lol. Edit 2: Yes, everyone, I am acutely aware that my judgement is I am an asshole. Thank you for all your contributions! I have apologized to my wife profusely and came home with flowers for her. Clearly even before writing this post, I apologized numerous times to her.... At the restaurant, on the way home, and hours afterwards. I'm usually a passive person and I don't like having conflict, so I literally apologize just to avoid conflict, even when I think I am correct (and I know in this case I am not). You can all make your judgements around my marriage and how I am undeserving, but you've read a few sentences on the internet to make that determination. Edit 3: Well, sorry to those of you rooting for my wife to divorce me. As much as you all probably think you know about me, my wife and my marriage by reading only a few sentences, we've resolved the matter and are laughing at all your comments together (well, it's more like she's laughing AT me).",

I have received so many messages making assumptions about what kind of a father I was and attacking me for not enabling a disrespectful adult. I hope you all enjoy handing out thousands of dollars every year to support the education of an adult who can't even bothered to give you the time of day after you've done everything for them. Thank you to the few mature and reasonable people who understand that I am not required to enable a disrespectful adult child. I've appreciated your public and private messages.** I want to start off by saying that I have done everything for my children. I was there at the hospital for their births, signed the birth certificates, I changed diapers and always provided them with food and designer clothes. But my ex is extremely manipulative and has tried to turn my children against me since day one. She manipulated my older daughter who refused to talk things out with me. I will still forgive her once she finally decides to snap out of my ex\u2019s manipulations and come back to me. Me and my younger daughter \u201cSarah\u201d had a great relationship until she suddenly flipped the switch in her senior year and also was poisoned against me. When \u201cSarah\u201d was applying for college I really didn\u2019t want her to go far because she has book smarts but lacks common sense and I didn\u2019t want her to fall for scams. I even offered to buy her a car if she lived with me and commuted to a local school. But Sarah just said that the local programs didn\u2019t have what she wanted. I found it insulting because I went to a local college and despite what my ex thinks, I am highly educated without some PhD. Sarah did not listen to my input at all. Her and my ex barely involved me in her college application process. My ex was extremely unhelpful. I would just ask basic questions like tuition since I was going to spend considerable funds, and she would either send website links. It would have only taken a few seconds for her to just answer the question so I can stay in the loop about what\u2019s going on. But this was just part of my ex\u2019s way of turning Sarah against me. Sarah enrolled at an out of state college and I didn\u2019t even find out until May because my ex didn\u2019t bother telling me. I didn\u2019t even get to see Sarah off at the airport since she didn\u2019t tell me she\u2019d left until after she was already gone. I constantly text Sarah asking how things are going. I send her funny posts on Facebook and ask her to call me. I even offered to split the cost of planefare so Sarah could visit over the holidays. She only responds on email and it\u2019s always her saying she\u2019s too busy. I am frustrated and tired of this. She is taking a lot of classes right now but I\u2019m her father and it would only take a second of her day to just text me back or talk to me on the phone for five minutes. I have supported and been providing for Sarah since day one. I am done being disrespected when I have bent over backwards for 18 years to give her everything and have sent $7,000 just this year for her schooling. I could be doing a million other things with that money. Maybe I am at fault for enabling it for so long but not anymore. I sent an email telling her that I am done with being disrespected and if she can\u2019t even give me the time of day then my ex can find someone else to split the cost of her schooling with. I sent the email over two hours ago and there\u2019s been no response. I know my wording might seem harsh but I am just so done with being disrespected. AITA?",

Over spring break (Apr 1-5) my wife and i were planning to go on a 5-7 trip with our kids to Vegas because, well, we don't have anything else to do.

I've been thinking that maybe, I could have them take the one-day off anyways, but I'm asking here to see if I would be wrong before i do anything that could be seen as dum. AITA?

        "selftext": " Backstory: My boyfriend\u2019s grandpa passed away 4 days ago. When he passed we met all of his family at a small ER to say our goodbyes. The ER made everyone wear masks. Due to a sickness going around the hospital.  So 2 days ago I started to feel really bad body aches, sore throat etc. Keep in mind I\u2019m 18 weeks pregnant. I told him how I felt and he basically said he doesn\u2019t want to get sick because his grandpas funeral is coming up. I told him I was feeling weak as well as hungry and didn\u2019t want to drive myself home then be hungry once I got there. I asked him if he was okay with helping me for the night and I\u2019ll leave in the morning. Basically just bring me some food to the room so I wouldn\u2019t contaminate any other areas of the house. He told me he had a lot on his mind and wasn\u2019t in the right head space to help me. So I told him I understand and left.  When I got home I made something small to eat then went to sleep. Yesterday morning he calls and checks on me. I tell him how I feel more sick than when I left. He just says okay. The rest of the day he has family over until about 3am just offering their condolences and keeping his family company. Around 4pm I called and asked him for help to see if he could bring me something to eat because all I had the strength to get myself were just snacks like chips, cereal. No real meals and I wanted to make sure I had enough in me for the baby. He basically brushed me off saying he has no idea how he could help and said I was selfish for not thinking about him grieving and how he was stressed and had a million things on his mind. He also told me that I was being evil because I said he wasn\u2019t helping me at all. After that I just hung up. He called me at 3am when everyone left to sleep on the phone with me but hung up 20 mins later said he would call back but didn\u2019t. Now I don\u2019t want to speak to him at all. But don\u2019t want to cause him more stress when he\u2019s already sad about his grandpa.  I want to know if I\u2019m an AH for not respecting his time for grieving. Also would I be an AH for not talking to him today. I know how It feels to lose your grandpa when you\u2019re so close with him. But at the same time I just asked for a little bit of help and don\u2019t feel like I was asking him for a lot. Most medications you can\u2019t take during pregnancy because they have bad side effects for the fetus. So I\u2019ve just been waiting It out and he knows that as well.  Update: It\u2019s been decided I am the AH here and that is fine. But for the ones wondering about DoorDash and other options. I recently just paid my bills and I made groceries for his place since I would be there with him during this time. So unfortunately I cannot afford DoorDash at the moment but that would\u2019ve been my first option. I didn\u2019t bring any food with me because all of the groceries really have to be cooked besides snacks. Also I know he is grieving and would\u2019ve never said anything but if he was okay enough to do favors for others yesterday he could\u2019ve picked up some food and left It at my door step. Didn\u2019t even have to come inside. Also I have family and friends but getting them to do things for me is a bit of a challenge and I learned a while ago to stop asking. It\u2019s really just been me and him caring for one another. But after reading some of your comments I understand how I came off as needy. Thank You for your responses \ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffe\ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffe Edit: I speak to my family everyday we are close in that way. I see them every week as well. No bad blood between us. My friends don\u2019t live close to me to where it\u2019s easy to just drop off food and go. My parents on the other hand do. But now that I\u2019m an adult and since my other siblings have had children my parents tend to them. I have two siblings who aren\u2019t in their kids lives atm due to their own faults so my parents step in. When I ask for help where they have to physically do something since I was a kid It was always I\u2019m tired this or I do t feel like going here that. But when they ask me they feel like im just supposed to do whatever It is they ask. So yea I never call on them first. I call on my boyfriend we\u2019ve been together 3 years. ",

We have a half sister Elsie 18F who is a result of an affair.  Our mother 50M is unfortunately terminally ill, the doctors have told us she doesn't have much time left.

Shortly after Elise was born, her mother wasn't very active in her life, leaving her to move in with us and live with us. I could always tell mom held some sort of resentment to her, my mom wasn't strong enough to leave after the affair and she regrets it everyday. Mom raised Elsie like her own for so long, but all Elsie could do was be snarky towards her and always say but you're not my real mom of course she'd only say that when mom was trying to discipline her. But as soon as she needed something expensive she'd be as sweet as sugar towards mom. I avoided elsie growing up because I always felt like she ruined our picture perfect family. Back to the day this happened, mom was reading out her will on her bed, my mother owns a beautiful emerald necklace; a family heirloom. She looks directly at Elsie and tells her she can keep it. I started crying immediately, it doesn't even make sense she's not entirely part of our family, her and mom share NO blood. I began to scream and yell at Elsie, I told her I wished she never walked into our lives, and that she should just leave because no one wanted her here. Damien tried to calm me down and reminded me we were in a hospital. Michael left the room with Elsie to avoid escalation. I saw mom crying and it kind of hurt but she hurt me worse. I grabbed my bag and left. It's been 3 days and I've gotten non stop messages from extending family saying I hurt my mom and she didn't mean any harm. AITA?  Minor Update: Hi all, I have received some very well worded and thought out comments/dms. Just to answer some questions, the heirloom comes from my mom's side not dads. My father passed 2 years ago. Elsie's mom is a deadbeat to put it nicely. My brothers rarely speak to Elsie mainly due to them living 3 states away. I will be talking to my mom asap, she wants to talk and I want too as well because at the end of the day I love her and would never change that. UPDATE: I visited mom and we had a really long talk about my life and growing up. I apologised to her and she accepted with a smile, she told me she'd always forgive me no matter what. That's why I love my mom she's a kind soul. I expressed to her that I felt I should have the necklace because we are blood and my grandma had it before, before her was my great grandma the x4. My mom started to tear up and explained that she thought I didn't want it and may as well pass it on to Elsie.  She said she knows Elsie isn't her real daughter, but over the years her resentment turned to pity cause she really didn't have anyone, especially after I moved out to live with my boyfriend. Mom said we could call Elsie and come to an agreement. Mom called elsie and she actually came over to the hospital instead. She sat with us and I asked her what her plans are with the necklace. She told me she was gonna take really good care of it and wear it.  I asked her if I could give her a portion of my current inheritance money as a way to buy it off her. E.g we both get $300,000 but I give her 25k, then she gets $325,0000 and I get $275,000 and the necklace. She said that was a good idea because I clearly have a connection to this necklace and she would benefit from liquid anyways.  Mom reassured her she would get other pieces of jewellery, my mom really loved bling. I feel happier knowing I could come to some sort of an agreement, but what's most important to me is that my mom and I are good and we are. I cried, told her I loved her and gave her a really big hug before I left. I said goodbye to Elsie and was on my way.  I called Damien and Michael when I got home to explain what had happened, they said they were proud of me for reaching an agreement everyone was happy with. We talked a little more of the course of 2 hours and we agreed that whilst we don't want Elsie actively in our lives, we were gonna make sure she was set and Michael said we should check in on her when we can.

        "selftext": "AITA for asking my daughter if she actually washes her face  I (m42) have a daughter (16) \u201cJo\u201d. Jo is one of my kids with my ex-wife, my ex has a job that has her traveling a lot so Jo stays with me the majority of the time. Within the last year maybe year 1/2 Jo has gotten bad acne. I  have gotten her multiple types of face wash and moisturizer. But her acne hasn\u2019t cleared up so I figured it was just part of her being part of a teenager. And maybe that she wasn\u2019t always washing her face and that\u2019s why it hasn\u2019t cleared up.  Well, recently Jo has been asking to go to a dermatologist because normal face wash and moisturizer don\u2019t work for her. I told her acne isn\u2019t that bad and she probably just needs to wash her face more often. Jo then told me she\u2019s self-conscious about her acne and that she would appreciate going to the dermatologist and just seeing if they could do something for her. So I asked her if she actually washes her face every day twice a day or does she only does it when she feels like it. She started crying and ran up to her room. Less than an hour later I got a call from my ex-wife calling me a huge asshole for accusing Jo of not washing her face and that\u2019s why she has acne and that it could be hormones keeping her skin from getting clear. And she said she\u2019ll make sure Jo gets to the dermatologist when she\u2019s back in town.  I didn\u2019t think I was the asshole but my ex-wife is pretty pissed and called me an AH multiple times so am I? ",

        "selftext": "Recently, I (21F) had my birthday and my boyfriend (21M)(of 3 years) took me out to dinner. After we had our meal he told me he had gotten a gift for me. Now usually, when he gets me gifts its never been too fancy, (e.g. last year he got me a pair of shoes I\u2019ve been wanting and some flowers. We\u2019re both only in our early 20s and in college so neither of us have a lot of money so I never expected too much in terms of gifts. So when I saw the box of a company I would never even dare to look at, I was extremely excited. But when he opened the box I saw a pair of gold earrings and my smile shrunk. I asked him why he would get me something gold if I only wear silver.He apologised but I was still a bit annoyed. And I realised he started becoming more frustrated on our way to his car. I could tell my reaction was bugging him and eventually he dropped me off at my apartment without coming inside and didn\u2019t even let me take the gift. I didn\u2019t want my night ruined so I had some of my girls over and so I wasn\u2019t really on my phone. The morning after my birthday I realised he had called me twice and sent me a message. To paraphrase, he basically said that he didn\u2019t realise it would be such a big deal and he never pays attention to my jewellery because he finds me beautiful with or without it - and guys just generally don\u2019t care about jewellery. I\u2019m pretty torn now because I think I may have overreacted and seemed ungrateful. On the other hand, we\u2019ve been dating for over 3 years and he doesn\u2019t even know what jewellery I like..",

        "selftext": "My (28F) sister \u201cBri\u201d 29F is getting married a year from now. Recently, she reached out to ask me to be a bridesmaid. I was surprised because Bri and I aren\u2019t super close, but I was happy to be a part of her special day. I used to be extremely overweight, and last year I decided to take control of my health and lost 75 pounds. I\u2019m much happier and healthier than I was, but I\u2019d still like to lose another 60. This became complicated when Bri sent us a link to the dress she wanted us to buy. I\u2019ve never been a bridesmaid, but apparently it is common for brides to ask their bridesmaids to buy their own dress. Still, the dress she requested costed $300, which seemed pricey to me. Bri has asked us to order the dress within a couple of weeks, as it\u2019s popular and she\u2019s worried it will sell out. I called Bri and told her I am on a weightloss journey and am not buying clothes, until I get closer to my goal weight unless they\u2019re from Goodwill or Walmart or something. Bri seemed really upset by this\u2013she asked if I could just purchase the size I am now and have it be loose at the wedding. I told her I plan on being almost 60 pounds lighter by the wedding, so the dress won\u2019t be loose\u2013it will literally fall off. Bri asked then if I could slow down my weight loss until after the wedding so the dress would fit. I told her absolutely not. I feel amazing and I\u2019m already losing at a slow and steady pace. I presented Bri with three solutions: 1\u2013I can wait to buy the dress until closer to the wedding, as I requested, 2\u2013she can buy me the dress now with her money, or 3\u2013I drop out of the bridal party, since she probably has people she\u2019s closer with than me anyway. Bri did not seem keen on any of these options\u2013even removing me from the bridal party. She told me I was ruining her big day and that it\u2019s about her, not me, so why does it matter if I wear a dress that\u2019s a little loose? I hung up after that to give Bri some time to cool off, but then I got a call from my mother telling me what a horrible sister I was and how selfish I was for not just ordering the bridesmaid\u2019s dress. She reiterated how it\u2019s Bri\u2019s day, not mine, and when I have my own wedding I can do things exactly how I want. To be truthful, I am finally starting to feel confident and to like how I look. Before I started losing weight, I wouldn\u2019t have cared if I wore a too-loose dress because I was \u201cfat and ugly\u201d anyway. Now, even though I only buy dirt-cheap clothes, I make sure to buy clothes that flatter me and accentuate my curves. I put a lot more effort into hair, makeup, and overall presentation. So yes, even though it is not my wedding, this will probably be the first formal event I go to after having lost weight, and I know lots of pictures will be taken. I want to look my best for these photos because I know I will look back on them and remember how hard I worked to get there. Does this make me a selfish AH?",

She is an incredible writer and went to a great private liberal arts school in California for writing, so many of us thought she would pursue songwriting as opposed to singing. She has released 3 songs and has an album on the way and they are just\u2026 bad. She\u2019s got a horrible timbre, it\u2019s flat and whiny with weird modulation in pitch. And she\u2019s even worse live.

UPDATE: thank you everyone for a lot of constructive criticism and for calling me in (though some of you definitely called me out)!

They\u2019re homeschooling the girl because she gets overwhelmed around big groups of people and because she goes to other programs and services during the day. All of this means she doesn\u2019t get many opportunities to be around other kids so my friend invited us and another family over and told us to bring our kids so her daughter could get used to being around other kids. Our kids are 12m, 10m, and 7f. The other kids were 11m and 8f.  She tried but the place wasn\u2019t set up very well for the kids. She had a little marble run set, magnatiles, board games, and coloring set up in the living room for the kids. Her daughter saw it and asked if those were her toys. My friend said no and that she got new ones for them to share with the other kids. Then she asked about the games and my friend said yes, those were their games. The girl picked up the boxes and took them to her room. My friend wasn\u2019t able to talk her into sharing them and refused to tell her they were for everybody.  The toys were also set up for younger kids so the boys started to get bored. I asked about turning on the tv and she told me that she can plug it in but she doesn\u2019t have cable or streaming so the only things they can watch are whatever\u2019s free on Roku or YouTube. We ended up sending the boys outside to play on her trampoline even though it was cold.  Her daughter only colored with the girls when her mom was with her, then after 20 minutes she wanted to play by herself and locked herself in her room.  She came out when dinner was ready and refused to sit with the other kids. There was pasta, chicken,  buttered noodles, and salad available but she still refused to eat any of it so her mom had to get up and make mac and cheese and dino nuggets just to get her to eat. After dinner she sat in her mom\u2019s lap and refused to move until we went home. She was thanking us while we were leaving and saying this was great for her daughter. I told her that watching her kid get special treatment and take things away from them wasn\u2019t good for the rest of the kids so she needs to wait until her daughter can be around people before she hosts again.  She thinks I was extremely rude and didn\u2019t need to say anything but someone needs to tell her that she can\u2019t have other kids over if that\u2019s how her kid behaves. AITA?",

        "selftext": "Throwaway account This is a very long, emotional story. Four years ago, my (27F) brother (30M) admitted to my exSIL (30F) that he had been cheating on her, gotten his gf (28F) pregnant and that he wanted to divorce her. The entire family disowned my brother and provided our exSIL with emotional and financial support throughout the whole thing (as we should.) My brother married the woman he cheated with. They now have 3 kids together (a son (3M) and twin daughters (both 1F), and are happily married. As mentioned before, the entire family disowned my brother and we didn\u2019t hear from him for 3.5 years. He reached out to my mom (who is very religious and hates adultery) 6 months ago and asked for reconciliation. My mom didn\u2019t want to talk to my brother all that much, she just wanted to meet her grandkids. Meeting her grandkids softened her attitude towards my brother. Soon, the entire family regained contact with him. My exSIL remained friends with my sister, and she freaked out when she heard about this. As a result, we only talked to my brother over the phone. The more I talked to my brother and his wife over the phone, the more I became friends with his wife. We would spend HOURS on the phone talking to each other about whatever random bullshit came to our minds. We made each other laugh. It was great. It was because of this friendship that I decided to finally invite my brother and my new friend to my house for my son\u2019s birthday party yesterday. It seemed like the perfect time to do so. What I didn\u2019t count on was my exSIL coming to the party. I had spoken to her a few days before and she said she wasn\u2019t sure if she was coming or not. Leading up to yesterday she hadn\u2019t said anything so I went ahead and invited my brother and his family. When my exSIL showed up, it was a shitshow. She yelled at my brother, who was just standing there in shock and when my exSIL realized who the woman next to my brother is, she let out \u201cstop looking at me you Jewish whore\u201d (my brother\u2019s wife is half-Jewish.)  I had tried to calm her down and talk to my exSIL, but at this point I yelled at her to get tf out of my house. She did, and we all just pretended this never happened. However, at the end of the party, my sister, who is still friends with my exSIL told me that I should have told my exSIL my brother and his wife were invited. It would have influenced her decision to come or not. Not doing say made me an ass. I explained that she didn\u2019t make it clear if she was coming, and that I only kicked her out after she made a blantanly racist comment. My sister was still pissed off about it, but she left soon after. AITA?",

She \u2018loves\u2019 gardening but I think it's more that she likes the idea of gardening because she is terrible at it; she is the Saddam Hussein of plants. She not only has a poor idea of how to garden (what plants need what kind of care etc) but mostly because she is so lazy, her plants die from neglect. The amount of care needed to keep her plants alive is probably no more than 5-10 mins a day, but she can\u2019t even manage that.\u00a0 Her position is that it makes her happy and it doesn\u2019t really affect me so what do I care, and my position is that it's slightly psychopathic to claim to love plants but not put in even a very modest amount of effort to keep said plants alive. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me. Our compromise on this is that we just agree to disagree. I turn a blind eye to her wanton plant torture/murder so long as I don\u2019t have to participate, and she goes on happily throttling mother nature to death in the backyard. Our problem is that my wife is going on vacation for 3 weeks and now wants me to water her plants. I can do this very easily (so could anyone) but I have a moral objection: I don\u2019t want to be involved her cottage industry of death. To me, I\u2019ll be participating in keeping these tortured souls alive, maybe even giving them hope of a better life, only to have it dashed when she returns in 3 weeks to resume her reign of terror.\u00a0 My wife is claiming I\u2019m being dramatic (I am) but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m wrong, so we\u2019ve decided to ask reddit and will abide by the crowd\u2019s decision. AITA for not wanting to water her plants? EDIT: Ok wow this ended up getting way more polarizing than I thought. The consensus seems to be that I would be TA (or that I already am, and never loved my wife and deserve to die alone), so I will definitely look after the plants. I am hoping that like any good children\u2019s movie I can grow from being a grumpy curmudgeon to having a heart warming relationship with a row of cherry tomatoes. My wife, who has read through your replies notes that she is mortified at being outed as a Registered Plant Abuser, and will certainly try to do better. I myself have learned not to criticise her online because just as in real life, people like her a hell of a lot more than me, which she has been cackling about for the last hour. Thanks everyone!   EDIT 2: Guys I threw in the towel like 2 hours after I made this post. It's now 24 hours later. My wife has taken to randomly quoting posts from this thread that make me out to be the ACTUAL Saddam Hussein. Then she cackles. She's a cackler. There's like 600 comments calling me AH and somehow its not over. I've done the math, and I won't win another argument until 2057. Please, mercy. I WILL WATER THE PLANTS.",

        "selftext": "Here's the situation: My roommate, Dave, has been dating this girl, Lisa, for a few months. Lisa is an amazing cook, and whenever she comes over, she whips up these incredible meals. The thing is, she always makes way too much food, and they leave a ton of leftovers in the fridge. Now, Dave never eats the leftovers. I\u2019m not exaggerating when I say that every few days, I have to go through the fridge and clean out all the old food Lisa leaves behind because it just sits there until it starts to go bad. A few weeks ago, I decided to throw a small dinner party for some friends. I\u2019m not much of a cook, so I was getting stressed about what to serve. I thought, why not ask Lisa to help out? She\u2019s always cooking at our place anyway, and I\u2019ve always complimented her food. So, I casually mentioned it to Dave, asking if Lisa might be cool with cooking for my party. Dave seemed a bit taken aback but said he\u2019d ask her. The next day, he told me Lisa wasn\u2019t comfortable with it because she didn\u2019t want to feel like she was being taken advantage of. I was surprised but told him no problem, I\u2019d figure something else out. The night before the party, Lisa comes over and starts making dinner for her and Dave, as usual. I\u2019m in the kitchen, hanging out with them, and mention that I\u2019m still trying to figure out what to serve at my party the next day. Lisa doesn\u2019t say much but continues cooking, and I notice she\u2019s making a LOT of food \u2013 way more than just for her and Dave. After they finish eating, they leave the leftovers in the fridge. Given the history of these leftovers going uneaten and just taking up space until I have to clean them out, I get an idea. The next day, I take out the leftovers, heat them up, and serve them at my dinner party, along with a bean dip I made. My friends loved the food and kept complimenting me on how great it was. I just smiled and thanked them without giving too many details. That night, Dave comes home, orders pizza, and goes to bed without even checking the fridge. Two days later (after Lisa has already come and cooked another dinner), he notices the leftovers are gone and asks me what happened to them. I tell him I used them for my party. He gets super mad and says I had no right to take the food Lisa made. I argued that it was just leftovers, and since they never eat them, I figured it was better than letting them go to waste. Now, both Dave and Lisa are pretty pissed at me, saying it was a jerk move to steal her cooking for my party. I think they\u2019re overreacting because it was just food that was going to end up in the trash otherwise. So, AITA for serving my roommate's girlfriend\u2019s leftovers at my dinner party without asking?",

        "selftext": "My wife and I have a 2 year old daughter\u2014let\u2019s call her Anna\u2014and we\u2019re currently on a family vacation in Hawaii with my parents and my in-laws (7 people total). We are staying at my father\u2019s timeshare, which he periodically invites us to. The two pairs of grandparents adore Anna and seem to get along with each other. Anna is undergoing potty-training right now, and as with all potty-training, there are occasional accidents.  We arrived in Hawaii two days ago, and she had quite a few accidents - I suspect because she\u2019s dealing with an unfamiliar place and new people. Right before dinner, Anna had an accident on the pullout sofa, which necessitated a call to housekeeping to swap out sheets and cushions. My dad wasn\u2019t happy.  When all 7 of us sat down shortly afterward for dinner, my dad sat down and the first thing out of his mouth was, \u201cAnna is out of control, isn\u2019t she.\u201d Bear in mind Anna was sitting right across from him at the table. I let it slide and continued eating, and my wife said something to try to brush it off. Then, my dad suggested that we put Anna back in diapers and that she not be allowed on the bed or the couch. I responded by saying that I didn\u2019t want to do that and that potty-training is a process that has highs and lows. My dad then remarked that it would be problematic if she had an accident on the carpet because it\u2019d be hard to clean up. In my mind, I thought to myself, \u201cSo you don\u2019t want her on the bed, couch, or carpet\u2014where is she supposed to hang out the whole time, the bathroom??\u201d At that point, I was frustrated and said something to the extent of, \u201cIf Anna\u2019s accidents are too big of a problem, we can always find another place to stay at.\u201d That\u2019s when my dad blew up. He accused me of threatening him and of being disrespectful. It seemed that he took my suggestion as a threat of leaving, and he made very clear that he felt offended. He also said that I needed to \u201cbe careful with what I say and show respect to your parents.\u201d I responded by repeatedly telling him that I didn\u2019t threaten him nor intend for him to be threatened. He responded that \u201cit doesn\u2019t matter what your intent was, because I feel threatened.\u201d At this point I was really upset, so I said something I probably shouldn\u2019t have, remarking that he was \u201ctoo easily threatened.\u201d My dad then demanded that I apologize to him. I didn\u2019t feel that I had to, but I half-heartedly apologized because I wanted the argument to end and because it was making things super uncomfortable for my in-laws who were also sitting at the table and eating dinner through all of this. Later that evening my dad pulled me aside again and lectured me further about the argument. It seemed that the whole blowup happened in response to my remark that we could stay elsewhere if my dad couldn\u2019t tolerate Anna\u2019s potty training accidents. AITA for saying that? ",

        "selftext": "My friend (25F) asked me(24F) if I could watch her dog, Cody, for a two weeks while she went back to her home state to deal with some family issues. She told me he was potty-trained, good with people, and good with other animals (I have a cat, Tawny). I had been to her house a few times, and, at least during the times I've been there, he's usually a sweetheart. I said yes, and when it came time for her to leave, she dropped Cody and his things off. First thing I realized is that Cody wasn't as house trained as she claimed. Maybe he knew it was wrong to pee in *his* house, but he clearly thought it would be perfectly okay to do it in mine. It happened on the first day, and when I told her, she said she had let him outside rather than walking him like she usually would, so maybe he had just sat outside and did nothing rather than do his business. It had been on the vinyl wood floor and I caught it immediately, so I just let it slide, cleaned it up, and took him for a walk right after. But as the days went by and it happened more than once, it became clear to me that he just wasn't that well potty trained at all. Second thing I realized is that, yes, he's friendly with other animals, but that doesn't mean good with other animals. Tawny had no problem with him when he was calm, but when he was hyperactive and getting all up in her space, she would get hissy and swipe at him. I ended up banishing him from the upstairs. But that led to another problem: Cody hated to be alone at night. He absolutely hated it, and made sure everyone knew about it by whining and barking until he would tire himself out. I finally ended up calling my friend and telling her that her dog isn't as well-behaved as she claimed, and that she needed to tell me another friend of her's she felt comfortable enough to hand him off to or that I was just going to end up sticking him in a doggy daycare that she'd either have to pay for or pay me back for. She got upset and asked why I had agreed to dog sit if I was just going to dump him, but I agreed to dog sit a dog who was painted as not having behavioral issues. She couldn't find someone she could trust to take care of Cody, so I found a non-expensive but still decently reviewed doggy daycare to drop him off at. She said she'd pay me back since I ended up paying up front, but that she was really cross with me and wasn't sure if she could depend on me for things anymore. I felt totally justified originally, but the more I thought about it, the more I realized I could totally understand why she'd be upset that I essentially went back on my word and also made her pay for a service she hadn't planned on using (I hadn't asked her to pay me to watch her dog). AITA? Extra Info based on things I'm seeing commonly asked about and brought up:  1. I know how to care for a dog. Before I moved out of my parent's house, I was the main caretaker for the family dog, Prince. One of the reasons I was convinced she hadn't trained Cody as well as she claimed was because Prince never had accidents no matter where he was once I had him potty-trained. He understood that if he's inside, he shouldn't do it. 2. The daycare wasn't something I just chose on my own haphazardly. I looked through the places near me and she agreed on one for me to take him to according to reviews and pricing. 3. I followed the instructions of Cody's care given to me. 4 walks a day with 4 hour intervals starting at 8 with a last call to the backyard before bed. As for attention, I\u00a0*like*\u00a0to think I gave him plenty. I played with him indoors and outdoors and he'd sit with me on the couch during downtime. He didn't really beg for attention during the daytime, and he didn't beg for attention during night until he got permabanned.4. I wouldn't say Tawny is socialized with dogs per say, but Cody isn't the first dog she's been around. She's been around Prince, but we had him trained not to rush at people or jump at people and that translated to other animals as well by default, so she never had a problem with him. When my friend had told me good with people and other animals, I had assumed that meant he probably had similar training.  Honestly, based on the mixed answers so far, I'll probably end up just splitting the costs with her. It seems both of us didn't think this through during her rush to leave. I had a standard for what I considered a trained dog to be based off of Prince without considering that not every dog is going to be like Prince, and she didn't think about how Cody might be in a new environment he's never been before and assumed he'd behave as well as he did at home. A lot of assumptions had been made on our ends that made sense in a vacuum, but not when put into practice. ",

        "selftext": "I have two children: Donna (21F) and Austin (19M). Both live at home but also stay on campus at their respective colleges. Austin has a girlfriend, Bridget, whom he\u2019s been dating for nearly a year. Early in their relationship, Bridget stayed over once while Donna was at school. With Donna\u2019s blessing, Bridget slept in Donna\u2019s room, and Austin stayed in his own. They chose to sleep separately, and there was no drama. This winter break, both kids were home. Toward the end of break, Bridget returned from out of state but couldn\u2019t move back into her dorm yet. Austin asked if she could stay with us for a few days. I agreed but mentioned we\u2019d need to figure out sleeping arrangements since we don\u2019t have a guest room\u2014just mine and my husband\u2019s room, Austin\u2019s, and Donna\u2019s. Austin said he and Bridget now share a bed, but his twin bed would be a tight fit. Donna has a full-sized bed, so I suggested Donna and Austin switch rooms temporarily. Donna could use Austin\u2019s bed, and Austin and Bridget would stay in hers. I assured Donna I\u2019d change the bedding afterward, but she was visibly upset and asked why Austin couldn\u2019t just sleep on the couch. I told her it was only for a few days, and since Austin wanted to share a bed with Bridget, this arrangement made sense. When Bridget arrived, everything seemed fine at first. That night, Bridget went to bed early, and Donna pulled Austin aside in the kitchen. I couldn\u2019t hear the start of their conversation, but Austin suddenly started yelling, \u201cShut up! Why would you say that?\u201d before storming into the living room. He loudly announced he\u2019d never invite Bridget back if \u201ceverything\u2019s such a problem.\u201d When I asked what happened, Austin explained that Donna asked him not to have sex with Bridget in her bed. He claimed he had no intention of doing that and accused Donna of being weird and trying to cause trouble. Donna said she had purposely tried to talk to Austin quietly to avoid a scene and hadn\u2019t said anything to Bridget. She also said it wasn\u2019t unreasonable to ask, given she knew Austin and Bridget were sexually active. I told Donna she didn\u2019t need to make such a big deal since I\u2019d already promised to wash the sheets. Donna became upset and ended up staying with a friend for the rest of break. School has since resumed, but Donna is barely responding to my calls or texts. Austin told me Bridget overheard the argument and now feels uncomfortable being in our house or around Donna. My husband said Austin caused the scene by yelling and pointed out that Donna wasn\u2019t out of line for making her request. He also said I should never have let Bridget stay in the first place.AITA? ",

        "selftext": "I (58m) was recently diagnosed with a terminal condition. Won\u2019t get into details, but it was the classical \u201cwent in with a paper cut, got out with AIDSCancer2000\u201d situation. I\u2019ve got roughly a year and a half left. Over time, I\u2019ve made a bunch of unwise decisions. I have multiple children with different women. I have three sons: Lance (43m) who has two daughters, Mark (22m) and Tony (15m). And four daughters: Cammy (38f) who has four children, Linda (30f), Ronny (28f) and Kathie (24f). Not going to lie here, I\u2019ll just say that I was only involved in raising Ronny and Kathie. Their mom died when they were little and I couldn\u2019t refuse to take them in. Ronny is starting her career in law and Kathie recently got her degree in agriculture. 9 years ago I also took in Mark, who was kicked out by his shitty stepdad. Mark decided against pursuing higher education. I own a ranch. It\u2019s not a little one, though, but we\u2019re managing just fine with the help of hired staff. We have about 500 heads of cattle, not counting the horses. The ranch has been in my family for generations. I know for certain that the only children who would be interested in preserving the ranch are Kathie and Mark. Maybe it\u2019s just my delusion grandeur, but I\u2019m very passionate about passing the ranch down to my children, so they\u2019ll be able to continue the family tradition. Knowing my children and knowing that they probably inherited my \u201camazing\u201d personality, I can say for sure that the second I draw my last breath, there will be an inheritance war vicious enough to make Middle East and Eastern Europe seem like a recess fight in kindergarten. It will be nasty, painful and disgusting. I wrote a will. As per my will, the ranch will go to Kathie and Mark 50:50. Including all the machines, trucks, other equipment, financial assets. Ronny, the executor of the will, is getting my 1970s Lincoln Continental. She\u2019s the one who\u2019s driving this car for the last 5 years and she\u2019s the one paying for maintenance, insurance, everything. The other children get $10k each and Tony gets my car, a 2010s Chevy Suburban, purely because it\u2019s a safe car and he\u2019s getting his license this year. The grandkids also get $5k each. It\u2019s not much, but I don\u2019t own much either. I\u2019ve notified my children that I don\u2019t have much time left. Of course they asked to see the will. I know that the second they see it, the shit will hit the fan and things will escalate. I don\u2019t want it. I don\u2019t want to spend my final year seeing my children suffer and fight. Ronnie advised me agains disclosing the will, she\u2019s a skilled lawyer so I trust her completely. I refused to disclose the will and now my children are enraged. They keep speculating about the will, they keep pestering me and giving advice on what should I leave to whom. Am I the asshole for refusing to disclose the contents of my will? By now, the only ones who know about them are me and Ronnie and I intend to keep it this way.",

        "selftext": "I have a rental unit in my home, a daylight basement with a separate entrance. I share my mailbox with my tenants, and until recently, I never had issues with mail or deliveries. About seven months ago, I rented to a couple in their mid-forties. She\u2019s a substitute teacher out all day, and he\u2019s \u201cretired\u201d and home during the day.Generally, they\u2019re great tenants\u2014rent is always on time, and they\u2019re easy to live with. However, she\u2019s a shopaholic, constantly ordering packages. I don\u2019t mind occasional deliveries, but the sheer volume has become overwhelming.I frequently order from Amazon and other sites.  I have deliveries sent to my garage and notifications set up.  I also work from home so I can retrieve packages quickly if drivers miss instructions. So far, no issues and I\u2019ve never had any porch pirates.When the tenants moved in, they went on an extended overseas vacation, saying they\u2019d have \u201ca few packages\u201d shipped back. I agreed, but soon became inundated with over 20 large boxes, some weighing 30-40 pounds. I schlepped them to my garage until they returned. I brushed it off, thinking it was a one-time thing. Then they went on a two-week cruise, and more packages arrived.Since then, deliveries haven\u2019t slowed down. I asked them to set up delivery instructions to the garage and notifications, the same as I did. I made it clear that I don\u2019t want my porch to become a target for thieves, especially since my house faces the main road. Despite this, packages were still left on my porch.Again, I spoke to her, and suggested she rent a mailbox at a nearby postal store, but she said it was too expensive and inconvenient with her schedule. Amazon Lockers don\u2019t work since she orders from other sites. She did agree to have packages sent to her sister\u2019s during vacations, but this doesn\u2019t address the daily issue.Packages keep coming to my porch, so I must move them to the garage and text them each time, sometimes 3 or 4 times a day. It\u2019s become a huge PITA, as I have a ruptured disk in my back, which she is aware. I've nearly tripped over boxes just opening the door to leave the house. Two weeks ago, there were two huge boxes taking up my whole porch.  I swear, I\u2019ve had to fight the urge to NOT punt the damn things off the porch and I don\u2019t want to bust my foot LOL.I\u2019m usually easygoing, but I\u2019m fed up with being the \u201cmiddle man\u201d for her \u201cshopping sprees,\u201d as she jokes and I feel it is very inconsiderate. I don\u2019t want to seem like a nitpicky, b*tch, especially since I already had to address parking issues when they first moved in.I made it clear when I interviewed them that we\u2019d need to respect each other\u2019s space due to our unique shared living circumstances, yet they seem oblivious.They\u2019re on a month-to-month lease, and I\u2019m considering raising the rent for the extra hassle or banning deliveries entirely.AITA, or is my tenant being inconsiderate and rude?",

        "selftext": "A little about me: I am 30, and my wife is 29. Before we got married (we knew each other for three years), we decided I would be the sole earner, responsible for finances and taxes, while she would be a housewife, taking care of the kids and household duties. We agreed she would never work, and I wouldn't ask her to either. In the first two years of our marriage, we didn't have kids. I worked from 8 am-6 pm. Sometimes she'd wake up and make me breakfast, sometimes she wouldn't. I didn't mind because we were early in our marriage. On days she made breakfast, she would also pack me lunch. On days she didn\u2019t wake up early, I would eat both breakfast and lunch at work. She would wake up around 12-2 pm, do household chores, and wait for me to come home. We would have dinner together and spend time going out for movies, dinners, or visiting friends, at least twice a week. This year, we had a baby. I took one month of leave to help her, which is the maximum my job allows. State leave was an option, because the subsidized pay wouldn't cover our bills. After my leave, her parents stayed with us for two months, helping with the baby. I supported all the household bills during this time. After they left, our baby was three months old, and this is when issues began. My wife was used to her previous routine of waking up late and now found it difficult to manage caring for the baby and household chores. I offered to help by cleaning the first floor of our house and putting our baby to bed several times a week, despite working from 8 am to 6 pm, handling all immigration paperwork, taxes, bills, and grocery shopping (since she doesn\u2019t drive). However, every day I come home, she seems angry or upset, often taking it out on me. Sometimes it's about the baby, sometimes it's about me not helping enough around the house. Today, we had an argument where I asked why she was consistently struggling with her responsibilities. I acknowledged that she had an easier life in the first two years of our marriage because she didn\u2019t work, but reminded her that we had planned for this baby and understood it would require more work. We had agreed she would be the primary caretaker and housewife, but now, she would not stop complaining and we can't stop having fights.

        "selftext": "My gf is currently pregnant with our first child, which we recently learned was a boy. Before we knew the gender we made a deal that if it was a girl, I would choose name and if it was a boy she would pick. That was before I realized that I hated every single name on her list. Especially the two that she was leaning toward the most, Elyan and Gawaine after the knights of the round table. One thing about her is that she has always been into fantasy and mythology, especially the Arthurian legends and she expressed that she has always loved both of these names. Even though I didn't like her choices, I figure we didn't even know the gender yet so there was no point it bringing it up. Unfortunately, it turned out to be a boy (Not because I didn't want a boy, but because I didn't want to have this conversation). I was hoping that she would change her mind and pick a better name, but no. She decided on Elyan, which I guess is better than Gawaine. But I still hate it. It sounds like a douchebag in a teen movie that they were trying way too hard to give a unique name. I asked her if she had any normal names that we would both be happy with. She asked me what was wrong with the name she chose and I brought up the above mentioned concern. She got upset and told me that we had an agreement and she would have accepted any name I chose, even though she didn't like any of them either. Now she'll barely talk to me. I've apologized for being so harsh about it, but I would at least like a say in the matter. I even mentioned another name that was on her list that I didn't hate as much (Leon) but she won't budge. I honestly don't think it's unreasonable for me to want to have a say in my own sons name, but everyone I've talked to said that they actually really like the name an it's not fair for me to go back on our deal. So AITA? Edit: Okay, yes making that deal was stupid and we shouldn't have done it in the first place. And yes, asking her to pick a normal name was a shit thing to say. I'm going to sit down and have an actual conversation with her about it and see if we can come to some kind of an agreement. And for those asking, it's pronounced Ellie-ahn (but sometimes when she says it, it comes out Elli-un.",

        "selftext": "Sorry this title sounds so dramatic, in reality it\u2019s more just complicated.\r  \r  So I (32/F) was adopted as a baby. It was supposed to be a closed adoption, but my biological parents\u2019 names were visible on the paperwork that came from the hospital/adoption agency. I was able to track down my bio-mom about 10 years ago. We exchanged a few emails and talked on the phone, and she sent me photos of my bio-siblings who were not placed for adoption. I expressed interest in meeting my bio-siblings and my bio-mom said she was sure they\u2019d like to meet me also, but she needed time to break the news of my existence to them because she felt some type of way about having kept it a secret for 20+ years.\r  \r  As I said, that was 10 years ago. Bio-mom never reached out again to let me know she\u2019d told the rest of the family about me, nor did I hear from any of them, so I assume my existence is still a secret. And when I did try sending her an email (about something unrelated, it was actually a medical history question) at one point after that, I never got a response. So my read is that she\u2019s not interested in further contact with me, which is understandable and more than fine.\r  \r  But on the other side of the coin, I was never able to find my bio-dad although I did try for a while. I\u2019ve recently been considering submitting my DNA to 23 & Me on the chance that maybe I can find him or family members on his side, and also I\u2019d just like to know more about my ethnicity and heritage. But I know that if I do so and anyone on my bio-mom\u2019s side has submitted DNA or does in the future, they\u2019ll see that I exist. \r  \r  I\u2019ve respected my bio-mom\u2019s wishes not to reach out directly to my bio-siblings even though I have their contact information, and I can\u2019t shake the feeling that doing 23 & Me is just a sneaky way of circumventing that and acting all innocent. It feels kind of crappy and like it would be a betrayal. I considered trying to send my bio-mom a heads up that I was planning to submit my DNA, but since our interaction ended with her ghosting me I worry that sounds like a threat or an ultimatum. \r  \r  So WIBTA if I submitted to 23 & me, and/or should I try to warn my bio-mom first?\r  ",

        "selftext": "My daughter (19) has been dating a boy for two years. My kids also recently started using an app to list their wishlist. My wife asked if I had seen my daughter's boyfriends list as 'we need to buy him something'. Maybe it's just me, but growing up, my parents didn't give two craps about who I was dating. Much less, have any intention of adding them to a present list. I asked a few friends and everyone was a resounding NO about this practice. My wife insists this is very normal and is calling me the AH for not want to comply. In my opinion, a bf/gf relationship is typically a temporary one and as such, doesn't warrant adding the person to the gift list. Now, if some reason they ended getting married, well that then changes the equation. But until then..  I'm a nope on this tradition being imposed on me. Edit: a little more detail is probably needed, considering all the questions.  We live 12 hours apart, so we don't have the opportunity to 'know him better'. Also, this is related to Christmas gifting. UPDATE: WOW, okay so once again, thanks for all the feedback. It just keeps on coming \ud83d\ude02. I had made a separate comment stating that I would be better about how I would deal with this scenario. I guess it got buried with the other comments.

        "selftext": "My husband (30M) and I (28F) are pregnant and thinking of baby names for our son due later this year. We\u2019ve got a good list of names we love, but we\u2019re still undecided. The other night I was up late with a bought of insomnia, thinking about when our baby is going to be a kid and what he\u2019ll be like, and I remembered my childhood best friend, Lucas.  We were best friends from 5 until 15, when he passed away. About a month before he died, we started \u201cdating\u201d, as in we held hands in the hall at school and kissed a handful of times. My husband knows about him as I have fond memories with him and he\u2019s in a lot of my childhood photos. He has never shown any disdain to me talking about Lucas. I also do not harbor any leftover romantic feelings for Lucas. I loved him, but we were not in love, just kids doing what kids do. He was my best friend and I miss him, but he is dead. Lucas is a pretty timeless name with multiple variations, as well as a way to honor my childhood best friend, especially since he doesn\u2019t have any siblings who could name their children after him. Plus, a lot of my and my husbands first name ideas have multiple syllables, so I thought a short middle name like Luke would help balance it out.  I suggested it and my husband hit the roof. He said me wanting to name our baby after an ex-boyfriend was gross and insulting to him as the father. He said if the baby should be named after anyone, it should be him. I told him I wasn\u2019t trying to be insulting and it was just an idea, not a name I was set on and him vetoing it was completely fine. I also said it wasn\u2019t naming our baby after an ex, but an old friend. He\u2019s still angry, though, and is demanding I apologize for disrespecting him as the father.  I refused to apologize because the suggestion wasn\u2019t a way to disrespect him. It had nothing to do with him at all, it was just a way to pay homage to my friend. He said he\u2019s not interested in brainstorming ideas anymore and has been giving me the cold shoulder ever since. AITA?  ETA: I will be apologizing to my husband, a lot of people pointed out that whether I meant to offend him or not, his feelings were hurt and I do want to try and remedy that. I\u2019m also going to try and have a conversation about how he feels about Lucas moving forward.  I now see a lot of people are getting caught by the ex part, as my husband is. I assumed it was clear that I do not still have feelings for Lucas. I do not wish I was having a baby with him instead. He was not a childhood crush. As an adult, I know that we were pairing off because that\u2019s what everyone else our age was doing and he was my very best friend, so why not? When he died, I mourned the death of a friend, not an ex lover.  I am also not trying to force this name on our baby. It was merely a suggestion because I thought it was sweet and it fit what we were looking for in names. If my husband says no, it\u2019s a no. I don\u2019t know why people thought I would do otherwise. ",

        "selftext": "I have a 13 year old daughter (almost 14) who is in 8th grade. School let us know about the graduation trip which she really wants to go to but we have been dealing with some behavioral issues. I told her she needs to behave before I would sign her up. A few days went by and I told her it wasn\u2019t enough time yet. I needed to see more. She was afraid the trip would be filled up and she would be too late. So I agreed to sign her up for the time being but I told her I would withdraw her if more issues arise. She agreed. The type of issues we had up until this point was: 1. She was failing on her chores on a daily basis. (Her chore list is very short. The only daily item is keeping her room clean. Then the weekly item of taking the trash out.)2. She was secretly texting an ex-boyfriend. Who didn\u2019t treat her well. 3. When she was caught, she tried to get her younger sister to lie and cover for her. 4. Her younger sister who came clean told me I needed to protect her because she was scared how her older sister was going to \u201cpunish\u201d her. After I signed her up, I told her that she needed to do everything as we say. We are not strict parents so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable. School\u2019s Thanksgiving dinner rolls around. We all went. As soon as she got her food, she tried to leave the table to go hang out with a friend (female). Her dad (my ex) told her to stay for at least a little while. She never asked me or my husband for permission to leave. Soon after she left and I thought it would just be a brief moment. An hour went by and she\u2019s not answering our texts or calls. My husband and I spent the next 40 minutes looking for her. Couldn\u2019t find her. Finally she answered a call from my ex. She was outside apparently, still with the same friend. That\u2019s when I decided we are taking her out of the trip. She is distraught. AITA here?  UPDATE: Due to the overwhelming amount of people that voted me the AH, I have reinstated her trip. We can see a noticeable change in her behavior right after. Prior to reinstating her trip, she was sad, yes, but she finally started cleaning her room every day (which as I stated in the comments, only meant cleaning up after herself, and pulling up the blanket on the bed in the morning. Just a few minutes a day is all it takes.) and she took the trash out without any arguments. The last few days since we've reinstated her trip, she's no longer cleaning her room and gave me such an attitude last night to take the trash cans out. I guess this makes me a better parent now?  ANOTHER UPDATE: So after I've mentioned that the trip is back on and her behavior is worse than ever before (she's still a great kid by the way!), I've gotten more comments and DMs letting me know I'm a bigger asshole now and somehow a worse parent. It seems this trip thing is quite a soft spot for many of you, expressing your own personal stories of your relationship with your parents etc. I know this is reddit and you have no way of knowing the whole picture of my relationship with my children, and at this point, whatever I say, many of you will read it as defending myself (which many have said is Red flags or attitude etc.) but honestly, it sounds like instead of telling me to get therapy, many of you REALLY need therapy. If you are still holding on to some mistreatments from your parents, you need therapy more than me. I was abused, emotionally and physically, growing up. I let all that baggage go and I try hard not to make the same mistakes. Many of you have not. Also, if you are telling me how terrible your children are than mine, then perhaps you don't need to give me parental advice. For all of you who said in so many years, my kids won't talk to me any more, please remind me to give you an update then! I'm sorry for all of you that are struggling with raising kids or struggling with your relationship with your parents. That is hard. I know I'm the last person you want advice from but I do have a wonderful relationship with my kids (most of you won't believe it any way I guess). My kids tell me stuff - not everything I'm sure, I'm not that naiive. But I do know about all of the boys they've dated. We try to have weekly dates with our kids - my husband and I each take one child, or we have open talk times so we can have an open communication. They do not feel smothered and understand that actions have consequences. They also see first hand what happens to kids with parents that have no rules vs the ones that do. We also take many many family trips together every year and the kids often even cook with me (their choice). I'm not a strict parent and I stand by that. I can't imagine any strict parent would let their children date at 12/13 years of age.  Thank you to the people who mentioned that she didn't see leaving the table as doing anything wrong. That comment resonated with me the most and was the main reason why I created this post. I suspected that was the case and why I wanted a second opinion and why I ultimately reinstated her trip. ",

My dad says it how she wants it to be for the pictures and such, and that it's a 'respect' thing. I should mention that they are very accepting of how I dress/present.

        "selftext": "Before we go into the situation, I (33M) own my own company, but the job requires me to be away from home for weeks at a time. When I am home it\u2019s usually only for 4-5 days before leaving for work again. My wife (30F) is a SAHM who is often overstimulated and who just recently started her own small business. Now on with the situation. So my wife text me this evening saying I may want call my daughter tomorrow and talk to her, because she\u2019s had a rough day. According to her my daughter was tired our two boys were fighting and this caused my daughter to become upset and start crying for me. My wife being overstimulated didn\u2019t let her call me so she could talk to me.  When I asked why my daughter wasn\u2019t able to call me my wife responded with \u201cI was overstimulated and just wanted them to go to sleep.\u201d  When I read the word \u201coverstimulated\u201d I called her.  My wife\u2019s love language is affirmation and I\u2019ve learned that calling and giving her words of affirmation helps her calm down. We talk for several minutes with me telling her how great of a job she\u2019s doing with the kids and with sales at her business. Because honestly she has been doing great with keeping the business up and holding down the home front. Then she asked, \u201care you mad that I didn\u2019t let her call you?\u201d I said \u201cno but it does upset me when I find out one of my children was literally verbally crying for me but wasn\u2019t allowed to call me.\u201d This caused her to blow up on me saying I don\u2019t know what she goes through on a daily basis because I\u2019m always gone for work and that she feels like I don\u2019t respect her feelings as much as I do our children\u2019s feelings. So I brought up that this wasn\u2019t the first time she\u2019s done this and asked her how it would make her feel if one of the kids were crying for her but weren\u2019t allowed to call her. She again said I wasn\u2019t considering her feelings. So I asked her why she doesn\u2019t let them call me if they\u2019ve been \u201cbad\u201d. And she replied \u201cI\u2019m hanging up now. I don\u2019t appreciated being told I gate keep my kids phone time with their dad as a form of punishment or that your not respecting that I didn\u2019t let her call because I was overstimulated. Call her in the morning.\u201d And she hung up. I never once downplayed the fact she was overstimulated. I just pointed out that I don\u2019t want my kids to EVER feel like they can\u2019t call me, when they need me to talk to them after a bad day, because it might cause someone else to be upset. So AITA? TL;DR my wife didn\u2019t let my daughter call me when my daughter was upset and is now mad that I implied she gate keeps their phone time with when she\u2019s overstimulated or trying to punish them. Edit: I call my wife and kids every morning and FaceTime them for about two hours each night.",

Recently my wife has been complaining about the difficulty of her job more and the amount of work she has to put in following a workday. I work about 50-60 hrs a week whereas she works 40hrs a week and I have tried to increase the amount of home work I do over the weekends lately. The problem for me lies in the fact that we take both kids to daycare which costs a pretty big chunk of our budget and is more or less 70-80% of her income per month. I make enough for all of us to be more or less in the same financial situation with a few more overtime hours a week if she quit her job. And since she has been complaining recently when she started venting yesterday I told her she might as well quit and just take care of the boys, and id bump up a few hrs since it's pretty much the same type of work (she works in social care). According to her I'm minimising her work and just not focusing on the real problem. I've tried to talk with her about why she doesn't want to just quit if she keeps whining about the job in the first place, but haven't had much success today. AITA? Edit: It's my fault for not including this but a lot of people are assuming this is day to day venting, it isn't. She wants to pursue a career in her degree(digital marketing) and sees no future in social care which is why I asked her why not just quit.",

Not because I thought the education was better but they follow an international curriculum based on the UK system and this is helpful for applying to international universities who recognize the system. My son will be studying engineering abroad. At the time when my son changed schools my daughter said she was happy not to switch schools and said it would be hard to make new friends etc. However now since he started attending she has gotten jealous and started reading his textbooks especially the science ones and going through things like the yearbook. She is now upset with me because I refused to switch her to the school even though she herself at the time said she was happy where she was. While I can afford it, the education isn't really better and I only sent my son there so that foreign universities recognize the credential better. Furthermore the school environment would be quite different. She goes to a girls only school and this is co-ed and most of the girls at the school are foreigners with different values and usually the kids of diplomats and embassy workers and the boys are either the kids of diplomats or the ultra rich locals and I am concerned this could cause her to either not fit in or lose her morals.

        "selftext": "6 months ago I (27M) lost my previous job at a software company. I had enough savings to support myself while I found a new job and continued to split bills with my girlfriend of 4 years Anna (26f). We\u2019ve always split things 50-50 as we work in similar fields and earned roughly the same salary.  2 months ago I got a job at Anna\u2019s tech company, doing the same job she does on a different team. Anna has worked there for 5 years and recently got a promotion. She was initially really excited and so was I. Working for the same company has been a really positive experience for our relationship except in one area: money. I make just over 12k more than Anna. It\u2019s become clear to me over the past 2 months every time we talk about budgeting and finances that she\u2019s assuming we\u2019re making the same amount. When I finally told her, she was very upset I hadn\u2019t told her this before because she feels it\u2019s unfair that we continue to split bills 50/50 if I make so much more than her. She also is upset that we have the same job and that I make more. I told her that\u2019s not my fault and that we should keep splitting bills 50/50 because my salary is barely 1k more than hers a month and she called me an asshole. She\u2019s been sulking ever since. AITA? ",

        "selftext": "I\u2019m lucky enough to be engaged to the woman of my dreams. She\u2019s perfect in every way and the wedding is currently scheduled for next June. Right now along with my fianc\u00e9e, I have a very close friend living with us. She was my roommate in college and basically family. 5 months ago, she found out she was pregnant when she was told her entire life it was impossible for her to have kids. She was ecstatic but her boyfriend (in case it comes up he was also my roommate and basically family) wasn\u2019t and begged her to have an abortion. Basically she thought she\u2019d never have another chance but they were absolutely not in any position to raise a kid at the moment. Their relationship got very strained and she ended up having a miscarriage. 1 week after, she found out her boyfriend was having an emotional affair with a coworker. They broke up and she ended up also getting into a massive fight with her family. Obviously I moved her into my place asap and while she was definitely struggling for a while I\u2019m glad to say she seems to be slowly healing.  A few nights ago my fianc\u00e9e had some of her friends over, all of which are bridesmaids. My friend joined them and all of them ended up getting pretty drunk. My fianc\u00e9e falls asleep pretty fast when she\u2019s drunk so I carried her up to our room and tucked her in so I could take care of everyone else. My friend at that point had started drinking really heavily and looked kind of sick so I walked her up to her bathroom and held her hair for about 20 minutes while she puked. When I figured she had enough out of her system I left her to go check on the other girls and get them home. I was walking down the steps and heard one of her friends make a comment about me helping my friend up \u201cbecause I wanted to get in her pants\u201d. The other girls around her immediately told her off (they\u2019re all aware of my friends situation btw) and I just stood obstructed on the stairway trembling in anger. I managed to calm down temporarily, come down and send them all home in Ubers (I had offered to drive them before but in all honesty I felt so angry I did not want to be in that position. 3 days later and I\u2019m still angry. I genuinely don\u2019t ever want to be in the same room as this woman ever again let alone have her 8 feet away as I say my vows. I haven\u2019t told my fianc\u00e9e any of this yet, but I was planning to do so tomorrow as well as request her friend atleast be removed from having a role if not flat out be uninvited to the wedding.  So would I be the asshole for asking to remove her for something she said when she was drunk Edit: quite a few comments on this now I want to address a few points 1. First, my fianc\u00e9e and her friends do not \u201chave problems with alcohol\u201d. My girl is a light weight and none of her friends were blackout drunk or anything that far. The only person who puked was my friend. Passing out because you drank too much and falling asleep after having a couple drinks are too entirely different things. Ok I really gotta spell it out here because this is getting fucking ridiculous. Every girl not living in my house had 3-4 drinks that night. Enough that none of them were getting behind the wheel but not enough that they were all massively hammered and completely out of control. My fianc\u00e9e had maybe 3 drinks and fell asleep 30 minutes after. Not passed out, not blacked out, just fell asleep. My friend was the only one who drank heavily, easily the equivalent of 6 (maybe a couple more at most) 2. At absolutely no point have I ever indicated I was going to take action or demand (my particular wording was request above, not demand) before talking to my fianc\u00e9e about the whole story and the issue. I now intend to talk to the bridesmaid as well before I request anything 3. I understand I\u2019m being a little overly sensitive. The reality is this whole situation has been harsh and shitty for everyone involved. In particular I know I\u2019ve been very defensive of my friend given her current situation with her family and it is entirely possible some of this anger towards bridesmaid was redirected from things my friends sisters have said and done to her in recent history. All this being said there is absolutely positively nothing more between me and my friend besides a deeply PLATONIC relationship. I do not have romantic/sexual feelings to my friend at all. Nor am I \u201cinsecure about society telling me I can\u2019t have women friends without wanting to sleep with them\u201d. I\u2019m just worried about my friend who\u2019s still in a pretty bad place and feel like very insulted someone would insinuate I would be taking advantage of her in such a state 4. She has not been living with us for 5 months, she found out she was pregnant 5 months ago. Her miscarriage happened approximately 2 months and she moved into my place about 2 weeks after that",

He came home from school holding his boyfriend' Jorge's hand and just announced it. I was a little surprised because earlier last week I asked if Jorge was his boyfriend and he kinda just shut down on me and just kept repeating that he wasnt a f*g... I just gave him a hug and told him I loved him. Then his brothers and his Ma took their turns getting their hugs in. I asked him later what changed and why he reacted like he did when I asked and he tells me he was afraid. But me asking and then not making a fuss made him feel safe. I was confused cause as far as I know I've never said anything explicitly homophobic though I don't think I've been super supportive of anything either to be fair. I asked why he was so scared and he tells me cause I'm such a gruff country guy and that we went to church every Sunday and how we're farmers. Where we live. How Id sometimes laugh at grandads jokes about girly boys. It hurt me to hear him say that to think I wouldn't love him.. I told him as much and he gets mad and says its not about me its about how he feels. I tell him I know that but that doesn't mean it dont sting. He tells me I should just be glad he wasn't afraid to tell me now and that i was overreacting. He stormed off upset.

In the name of our son, my in-laws held a small gathering with the immediate family. This was also the first time for many of them to meet our son, especially the children.  We had a great time with our family, and it would have been better if it weren't for my SIL (husband's sister), who kept calling our son by the wrong name. You see, their cousin also had a baby boy, who is two months older than our son, and SIL kept confusing his name with ours. IMO, I think she simply forgets her nephew's name. In our three-day stay at their parents' house, she regularly called him by the wrong name. My husband and the rest of the family were only amused by it, and would constantly remind her. So did I, but I reached the point where it pissed me off. When she called him by the wrong name again, I snapped. I told her that whoever she's calling is not here, and if she had paid attention, maybe she would notice that this is a different baby. After an awkward silence, she apologized and assured me that it wouldn't happen again. But the rest of the stay went by awkwardly. After returning, my husband told me that it was unwarranted, and I was mean to his sister for an honest mistake. Since I knew that she struggled with people's names, I should have given her some time. He did ask me to apologize to SIL, and I will. But, still, AITA here?",

        "selftext": "My wife and I, along with my mother and aunt went out to lunch today.  The previous day, my wife and I had agreed we would try to pay for our own share of the bill rather than having my mother or aunt get it.  Last night, around 11pm, after my wife had gone to sleep, I had a conversation with my mother that I would just grab the check rather than mess around and fight over the bill.  I did forget to mention this to my wife (I work overnights and had just started my shift, and by the end I had forgotten).  So anyway, at lunch today when the check came, they asked if we wanted separate checks or all on one?  I responded, all on one is fine, then my wife said she had thought we were getting our own.  I said we could just get it.  This maybe happened over 2 or 3 seconds and I didn't think much of it. After lunch she was mad because I put her in a position where she said she came off very inconsiderate with her comment about getting our own checks (and thus, others would be paying their own).  I assured her no one thought that and it was not a big deal, but was still angry that I had put her in the position and she would have never said anything if I had told her prior to lunch.  I apologized for not letting her know in advance, as I never want to hurt my wife's feelings, but I maintained it wasn't a big deal, no one thought that she was being inconsiderate at all.   It's not about the money at all, everyone at the table could easily afford treating everyone else, she is mad about the position I put her in.  I really don't think this is a big deal, the whole interaction was 3 seconds tops, and no one thought anything of it. TL/DR:  AITA for thinking my wife inquiring about paying our own way at lunch (and thus, others paying their own way) is not a big deal?   Thanks!",

        "selftext": "My boyfriend (28m) and I (25f) have just wrapped up a very long cross-country road trip. While traveling, we naturally encountered traffic jams and during some of the more abrupt stops, he put on the hazard lights of the car whilst braking. I brought it up that I find it kinda weird that he does this, and maybe it isn\u2019t necessary. I guess beyond the fact that I\u2019ve never heard of someone else doing this, I worry about other drivers around us. I told him what if the person behind you takes it the wrong way\u2026 but that\u2019s probably me over analyzing. Idk it seems like a bit of overkill?  He got frustrated with me for being a backseat driver and asked me to stop nitpicking (paraphrasing) his driving. I get that, I guess I just still think it\u2019s weird! So, AITA? Do people think this is normal? For clarification, we both live in the US, he grew up in the midwest, I\u2019m from the easy coast, and we were mostly on major highways during our drive UPDATE It has been so interesting to see how some people, like me, have never seen this before, while it is custom practice in other countries. Boyfriend is very proud to be driving like the best, I am excited for him and really admire his cleverness (he started this of his own accord and also rarely sees it on the road). Definitely have learned something and have had my mind changed!  I admit I am still learning how to not backseat drive and comment on small things. I agree that at the crux of this is my nature to control. I really didn\u2019t mean the word \u201cweird\u201d to be mean, however. I am a naturally curious person, and I really appreciate the comments from those in long-term partnerships offering really great suggestions for communication in the form of curiosity rather than criticism/critique. My favorite perspective that I saw a few times is he may have been overly cautious since I was in the car. We read many of these together and when he saw that, he agreed that is a big part of it for him.  I am lucky to be in a relationship where these instances of using the wrong language are not the end of the world, still I am going to work on my approach and reflect on why I feel the need to comment. As an aside, we actually got the idea to post this from the Podcast Smosh Reads Reddit Stories, which we listened to a lot on our long drive. This was my first post and have never really explored reddit, so I agree with those saying this could\u2019ve been better suited for other forums like no stupid questions. And yes, I googled. And no, there wasn\u2019t a clear answer. Unfortunately, in the US, every state has different road laws, making it hard to find a clear answer. Thank you to the people who didn\u2019t shame the question itself. Grammar/spelling people, I changed my mistake, hope your eyes are happy, I also was cringing as I realized my oops ",

We have 3 children in their early teen. I reluctantly agreed and was then bombarded with questions.  She wanted to know why didn't I tell her I broke up with my ex girlfriend (43F)? How come everyone else was informed when it happened and she was just finding out months after that fact? Why have I been letting my ex girlfriend and her kids live with me and our children if they weren't together anymore? Does this mean she and her husband are allowed to come over and see the children now? By now she was emotional and crying. She told me I was an asshole for not telling her it happen as that means this opened up the door for her to be closer to our children.  I sighed and told her that this didn't change anything and my dating life is none of her business. I didn't tell her the first time my girlfriend and I got together either. The only reason I had told her about my girlfriend and her 3 children was because they were moving in.  I explained to her I was going to tell her about my break up when my ex girlfriend and kids had moved out. She didn't like my girlfriend anyway, so I also didn't want to tell her because I didn't want to hear the 'I told you so's. This didn't change anything having to do with our children so its none of her business. She then freaks out and calls me an asshole. She says she doesn't give a crap about me and my dating life. She  says my girlfriend was the main reason we had so much turmoil in co parenting. She, my ex girlfriend, was the reason she, my ex wife, wasn't allowed at the house. She was the reason my family had to have 2 of each holiday as she refused to be in the same room as my ex wife. My ex wife then tells me, if she would have known we broke up when it happened, then she could have been spending quality time with our children in their home. I told her she knows now so we can move forward in co parenting our children then hung up. A little context. I have full custody of our children. My ex wife had a mental break down and was deemed unfit. She still sees them every other weekend. She and her boyfriend, now husband, use to come over the whole day to see the kids. When my girlfriend moved in, she said she didn't feel comfortable with my Ex wife coming over. So we started having shorter outside visits. After that conversation I went to my parents house and asked them who told my ex wife. Expectantly my mother says she had let it slip, but she also had no idea my ex wife didn't know as its been 4 months since the break up. Both of my parents think I'm an asshole for not telling my ex wife. Am I?",

        "selftext": "My wife and I rented one half of a duplex for 4 years. In that time, we adopted our cat, Addie. A year and a half ago, there was a fire caused by someone on the other half of the duplex. The house was destroyed. We lost a lot, but luckily Addie was okay. We temporarily moved in with my brother\u2019s family. They were amazing to us. The kids loved Addie.  It soon became clear that our landlord was going to have to tear down the duplex and rebuild as the damage was that bad. We needed to find a new place to live. After endless searching, we realized all the vacancies that we could afford in our area didn\u2019t allow cats. My brother and SIL generously offered to keep Addie while we tried to get off the waitlist at a pet friendly apartment. In the past year and a half, we\u2019ve visited their home frequently and have gotten to see Addie.  To add, if it matters, my brother\u2019s family began financially taking care of her. Including vet bills, food, etc. They refused to take our money.  The more time that passed, I knew the odds of us being able to take Addie back were slim. My SIL works from home so Addie\u2019s gotten used to someone being around. Whereas my wife and I work in offices in a different city. The kids were also growing more attached. I tried to have this conversation with my wife multiple times but she was in denial. Last month, we finally got off the waitlist for a better apartment that allows pets. My wife instantly called my brother to ask about Addie. He asked that we meet with him and his wife for dinner.  As I expected, they asked if they could keep Addie. They said they had grown attached to her. That the kids would have a hard time but they felt Addie would too as she\u2019d gotten used to them and their lifestyle. I have to admit, Addie does seem happy there. My wife started to protest but I said we\u2019d think about it. At home, I told her this was for the best. She got pissed and said she wants Addie back. That we had a deal. I said we need to think about what\u2019s best for Addie and also what\u2019s fair to everyone. Ultimately, she reluctantly agreed. We still see Addie, but my wife acts different when we\u2019re there. Sometimes I feel she resents my brother and his family for keeping Addie. But she won\u2019t discuss it. Recently, a friend asked if we\u2019d ever get another cat. My wife said no as she feels I\u2019d just give it away again. I was hurt and said I never would\u2019ve given her away if not for the circumstances. She made it clear she\u2019ll never understand my choice. AITA?",

I don't know how he convinced my sister to finally give him the time of day but that's a story for a different day. Anyway, they've been married for 4 years and have a 3 year-old daughter together.  I'm convinced that the only reason they even had a kid is because my sister has always wanted kids and she would've left his ass if he didn't agree to having one. The reason I think this is because he's outright said my sister is the most important person to him (even after their daughter had been born) and when their daughter was in the hospital he only came home because my sister told him she was scared and not because he was worried about their daughter (he admitted this himself). I think my niece and sister both deserve better but I usually bite my tongue to keep the peace and because he has a way of always making the other person look like the bad guy in front of others so I knew I would get a lot of backlash if I said anything to him. BUT recently he missed his daughter's birthday because he went on a work trip that he could've moved or cancelled so since my niece is so young my sister celebrated her birthday twice since she wouldn't really know the difference. During her second birthday party he was completely unbothered and wasn't giving his daughter any attention (he was too busy watching my sister the entire time). I felt so bad for her because she's a complete daddy's girl and just wanted him to play with her on her birthday and he wasn't encouraging her at all. The only time he bothered to give her attention was when my sister was around. Eventually it was just me and my brother-in-law and I told him he should give his daughter more attention and he just scoffed and claimed he did (he absolutely doesn't). I asked him if it had been my sister's birthday would he have went on that trip and he wouldn't answer because we both know the answer is no. I can't remember exactly what else was said but he told me to mind my own business and I was feeling pretty angry on my niece's behalf so I told him that he shouldn't be surprised when one day she was all grown up and hated his guts. I also said that my sister would catch on and she would hate him too which I think got to him more than the comment about my niece. As I mentioned before he has a way of making the other person look bad so he spun a story to my sister and now she's upset with me because I won't apologise to him. AITA?",

However, through a few family members, I came to find out that the girls in the family were invited but but not the boys. Fine, I\u2019ve heard of that before. However, my two sons (9 and 7) heard that their girl cousins were invited and my 7 year old felt very left out.

I reached out to my husband\u2019s aunt Liz who is hosting the shower to see if an exception could be made for Andrew. She was nice about it but said that the reason they hadn\u2019t invited boys was because of venue limitations and also the theme (diamonds are a girl\u2019s best friend) is very feminine. She said Amelia adores my boys but many of her friends have sons and she just can\u2019t accommodate them all. She was apologetic and I ended the conversation because it was awkward. However, Andrew is still upset and I\u2019m thinking of reaching out to Liz again to see if an exception should be made. My husband thinks I need to let it go. AITA? ",

My dad was completely on board, helped her pick out a piece of land, bought the land, got her set up with a modular building company, paid for the building, donated supplies, and paid for everything for the first year. Every year his company donates thousands of dollars to her school. They provide backpacks, lunchboxes, and water bottles to each of her students every year, they donate food on special occasions, they fund graduation every year, and they provide teacher gifts for Christmas and ed of the year. She talked about wanting to expand and his company donated a whole ass building and new playground.  I (27f) want to open a salon. I asked my dad to help me open it like he did with my sister's school. He recommended I spend a few more years working then he'll consider it.  I reminded him that he helped my sister when she was 2 years younger than me but he said it's different because she started babysitting at 11, working at a swim school at 13, started working with preschoolers at summer camps by 15, and got a job as a preschool teacher fresh out of high school. He also said she had a good understanding of how the business would work and had great ideas for location and specialization to attract parents. I told him I do have good ideas but he's just not willing to listen and spend half of what he did on my sister on my business.  He said the only way he'll reconsider is if I get at least an associates in business, get a job in my field and keep it for 3+ years, and save at least half of the start up costs. All of this has to happen within 4 years.  We got into an argument and I called him a dick for supporting my sister and spending tens or hundreds of thousands on her business but either refusing or making me jump through hoops for me to get half of what she got. He says I'm being ungrateful and unrealistic and can't expect something just because my sister has it. ",

He had got all defensive and said why am I always putting them before him. He said there has been multiple times where me and him couldn\u2019t do something because I had to do things with another family member. He also said it was getting annoying and that he kind of regrets dating someone who was so close with their family to which I replied: \u201cIt\u2019s not my fault I have a family that actually cares about me and didn\u2019t neglect me for drugs\u201d He got all quiet after that and hung up. I tried calling back multiple times and he\u2019s not answering. Idk if I should text and apologize or just leave it alone. Edit: I sent him a long message apologizing for what I said he hasn\u2019t answered yet I think he might be sleep hope he sees it in the morning. Update: I thought he would wait until the morning but he randomly FaceTimed me saying that he was also sorry about what he said as well it was basically us back and forth apologizing lol. Anyways tomorrow we are gonna meet up to do a deeper discussion as I want to properly apologize to him in person about what I said and I let him know I\u2019m truly sorry. Update 2: Okay we met up at this restaurant and talked about it. I explained multiple times that I was sorry and that I should have never used his trauma as a jab towards him. He also apologized for telling me to stop seeing my family. I told him I\u2019d cancel the plans with my dad and any other plans in the future if it means we can continue the relationship as I didn\u2019t want to lose him. He got all happy about that and now I\u2019m over at his house and we\u2019re just chilling together. Thanks everybody for the advice I got a lot of messages telling me how to apologize and what to say if I really wanted to continue going through this with him.

My fiance has a daughter from a previous marriage as well, Kiki (15). All 3 girls are in my wedding party, with Kiki as a bridesmaid. I\u2019m letting all of my bridal party pick out their dresses, with the condition they\u2019re all the same color and within a certain budget. I\u2019m also paying for all of them. Kiki sent me a link to the dress she liked and I thought it was pretty. I planned on ordering it once I had the other members of the wedding party sending me what they wanted. I was scrolling on Facebook one night and one of the buy/sell groups I\u2019m apart of showed the dress that Kiki sent me. It was only used once in a wedding and is in perfect condition. You can\u2019t even tell it was worn before. It also so happened to be in her size. So, I figured it\u2019d be cheaper to buy this as it\u2019s a dress she\u2019ll likely also wear once and never again. The dress new online is $200. The person was selling it for $50 and just wanted it gone. I\u2019ve seen the dress in person. No stains, no smells. Truly a steal. So, I bought it.  When I told Kiki, she got mad and said she was the only one not getting a brand new dress. I pointed out I\u2019m still getting her new shoes, accessories (again all of her choice), have alternations done to the dress as needed, she\u2019ll have her hair and makeup done with us. If I found any other member of the bridal party\u2019s dress in a similar condition and cheaper price in a Facebook group or a thrift store, I\u2019d buy it. As it is, I\u2019m spending about a grand on dresses for the 5 members of my bridal party. If I can save a little money, I will. Kiki wants me to buy her the brand new dress. I spoke with my fiance and he agrees with me. We told Kiki if she wants the dress brand new, she can pay the difference. She\u2019s still upset with us. Other members of my husband\u2019s family feels I\u2019m being a cheap ass and should just buy the dress new. AITA?",

        "selftext": "My husband (38M) and I (37F) have been married for 11-years and have 2 daughters (8 & 4).  I am currently 12-weeks pregnant with our third child.  I just had an ultrasound and we were able to determine the sex of the baby, a little boy.  We have found out the sex of all of our children this way.   My husband is a third.  As in, John Smith III.  Before we got married and were having discussions about kids, he did make it very clear that passing down his name was very important to him if we had a son.  At the time I thought it was really cute and adorable how much pride he took in it since most guys don't really care about that sort of sentimental stuff.  But as the years have gone by I've definitely cooled on the idea quite a bit and I don't think I want to have our son be named after my husband that way. Obviously, with our first 2 kids we didn't even have to think about it.  But when we were choosing names for our daughters, my husband was very much in the you can take the lead on naming our daughter because I already have the name picked out if we have a son camp.  It's not like he wasn't involved in naming our daughters, but he definitely deferred to my opinion.   So, when we found out we were having a boy, my husband was very excited.  On the car ride home after the ultrasound it was all he could talk about.  He was giddy like a teenager talking about how proud he would be of sharing his name with his son. I don't know if it was the best time to bring this up, but I kind of had one of those yeah, about that moments.  I told him how I know we had talked about this many times before with our other kids and that I technically agreed to it years ago, but I don't think I want to name our son the same as my husband. I don't think I've ever seen anyone's mood change so quickly and visibly as my husband's did in that moment.  It was like all the joy went out of his body all at once.  I told him that I just don't want our son to be a forth.  It seems tacky and has weird aristocratic vibes that just don't seem right to me.  I told him that I am not totally against the idea, but I don't want to just agree to it right now because I want time to think about other names too. He took that as me basically saying that I am going back on our years-long agreement and that there is no way we are naming our son after him.  He said this is pretty much me telling him maybe when I really mean no.   This has taken all of his excitement about the baby away.  He's been withdrawn and quiet with me ever since.  When I try to talk to him about it, he tells me he has nothing to say because he's been very clear about where he stands on this and he feels betrayed by my change of heart.   I asked him if he would want to think of some other names together and he told me to give him a list and he'll look at it when he can.  I know I technically agreed to this years ago, but it just doesn't feel right to me anymore.  ",

I knew my parents would give my kids lots of extras and offer me help with gifts when we didn't need it without doing the same for the others and at the time I had the view that what they did with their money or paid attention to wasn't any of my business.

        "selftext": "I went on a hike with some friends this week, which we planned on doing over 5 days. After a day and half, I realized I was not physically fit enough to complete the rest of the hike, and made the decision that I was going to turn around before it was too late. For context, it\u2019s ~35 miles into a mountain range with 2000ft of elevation gain per day, I do not do much cardio or hiking, though I am relatively fit. I do have some cardiac issues and am particularly susceptible to altitude sickness, though it was certainly my fault for overestimating my abilities. I shouldn\u2019t have went in the first place, but to be honest, the trip was partially my idea.  However, I made it very clear to my friends that I myself was going to turn around, and I wanted them to complete it without me. At no point did I ever ask them to turn around, as a matter of fact I explicitly told them not to turn around with me as I didn\u2019t want to ruin the trip for them. Yet, they turned around with me, which I did appreciate, but I would rather them have finished it without me, as I made very clear to everyone. Of course we were a bit disappointed that we didn\u2019t finish it, but when they claimed it was my fault, I couldn\u2019t help but disagree. I argued for 30 minutes trying to get them to continue without me. I chose to turn around because I knew it would be a risk to all of us had I continued on, especially if things got worse, and we were already 10 miles deep so it was best to make the decision before it was too late. We also had no PLB or connection to the outside world, so there was no way to call for help if things got bad. I was willing to accept the risk that came with returning solo, as it is heavy grizzly bear country, but I did have bear defense. Once we finally got back, everyone claimed how I ruined their weekend. I can see why they think that, but I explicitly told them not to follow me back, and to continue the hike without me. They say it was my fault they didn\u2019t get to finish it. Tbh it made me feel like shit and I don\u2019t think I want to go on another trip with them because I don\u2019t want to risk ruining it. For a bit more context, these are my best friends whom I\u2019ve known my whole life. I don\u2019t hold any resentment towards them, and I am 100% confident we will remain friends for many years to come, if not for the rest of our lives. We are still hanging out today, but I can\u2019t help but feel like they hold some level of resentment for my decision to turn back on the hike.  Am I the asshole for ruining everyone\u2019s weekend? I thought I made the right choice but I feel as though I may not have.  Edit: thanks for your input everyone, I realize that I grossly overestimated my abilities and I apologized to the whole group. I am very grateful that they were looking out for me, and they are undoubtedly the best friends I could have. Nobody holds any resentment, we were just upset at the time.  Next time I will make sure I am prepared, and choose a trail within my skill level. ",

I got called about it during work and rushed to the hospital to be with her during the labour. It was obviously a very stressful time, as it took more than 15 hours from start to the end, but finally our little one was born and was healthy. I was in the room for nearly the entire time (other than briefly heading out for food, toilet etc), holding her hand and being the 'punching bag' as she swore during certain times during the worst of it. As it was getting towards the end, just as the head was coming out (and it all happened very quickly from then), more medical staff came into the room and I am someone who gets nervous around lots of people. I think because of that nervousness, I was talking a bit more, introducing myself to the new people coming in, making jokes (saying I hope it's not a bad omen that the weather is so bad, because a thunderstorm had started outside that we could hear) and then when our baby finally came out fully, at that second, I made the Age Of Empires 2 'new villager' sound (Shhhh hoooh) as a joke, but I think only my wife understood the reference (as the doctor and nurses gave no reaction) and the look she gave me could have sunk a thousand ships, she looked so so angry, before then seeing our little one and finally smiling (but didn't look at me for about half an hour, and even then she was really annoyed for the rest of the day). Anyway, I thought it was a joke that went down badly in a moment of high anxiety, but my wife has twice in the past week told me that I ruined a moment that she hoped would be one of the best in her life. I've apologised both times, but she has this look I've not seen before, something beyond disappointment. It's really put a downer on the past nine days of what I thought would be our happiest time together, after what was obviously a very stressful time (for her mostly, of course). AITA?",

So utilities are all included, but for some reason, my roommate thinks that they\u2019re entitled to leave their Alexa powered light on maybe 16 hours a day 7 days a week. There is no plants or animals in their room, so I feel as if they don\u2019t need to leave their light on even when they\u2019re not home. Their reasoning is, and I quote \u201cLED\u2019s don\u2019t use electricity, just the fixture\u201d and \u201cSo I am an expert in electronics, and LED\u2019s use *like* no electricity\u201d. I refuted the point by claiming that they do use electricity even if it\u2019s a little, it adds up over time. Plus, they do this in every room in the house, they\u2019ll leave the kitchen lights on, go to their room for 20 minutes and when they come out and the kitchen light is off, they\u2019ll say some shit like \u201cWho turned off my light? I was using it\u201d. I would say something like \u201cNo one was in here, and how difficult is it to turn the light on again?\u201d. Electricity has gone up to $700/mo from $200/mo after they moved in. They leave their lights on, brought a fridge into their room and leave their gaming computers, plural, on all day. I don\u2019t even ask them to unplug the fridge or computers, I\u2019m just asking for the light to be turned off which is easily done without touching the switch cus they installed an Alexa to turn off their light.

With the older two, she was going back to work at 12 weeks, had them in daycare all day every day, didn\u2019t breastfeed, and just seemed disinterested in becoming a parent. It\u2019s night and day with this baby though. She quit her job so the baby wouldn\u2019t be in daycare, she\u2019s into attachment parenting, refused to even try formula for this one, and refuses to go anywhere without her.  They\u2019re going to move for my son\u2019s job and are taking the weekend to look at houses and explore the area. My DIL asked if I could take the older two and when I asked about the baby, she said the baby would be coming with them. I asked why she was taking the baby and not the older two and she said it would be so much easier. She doesn\u2019t have to worry about the kids running around the stages houses, getting bored after touring 5 houses, getting tired, etc. and that the baby will happily stay in the carrier or in her stroller. She also mentioned that the baby has never been away from her and she doesn\u2019t want to put her through 2 nights away from mom yet. She also wants to take the baby out and she thinks it\u2019ll be easier to check out the kid places with only one kid.  I refused. I told her that I think it\u2019s favoritism to take one kid on vacation and leave the others at home, especially when she already has a history of treating her better than the other kids. The other kids would love to go on this trip and they won\u2019t understand why their mom left them but brought their sister.  She says I have no right to criticize her parenting and that she does not have a favorite. I refused to budge and told her I\u2019d take all of them or none. She has a friend watching the older two now and told her that I am not allowed to see the kids this weekend because she thinks I\u2019ll talk about her to the kids and cause problems between her and the kids.  My son thinks she\u2019s overreacting but he also thinks I shouldn\u2019t have said anything because I know she had ppd with the first 2 and she feels guilty about not being a good mom to the first 2.

        "selftext": "Son's birthday today. He's 5 years old. I wasnt there this morning as stay away from home some nights due to work. Even if had slept at home would have left for work before the kids woke. We have a party planned on Saturday, and will be there at dinner time tonight. I realised that my wife gave my son a present this morning. She said it was from 'us. Apparently she does this every year. I was hurt, and told her so. I thought it was selfish that she couldn't wait to share his excitement.  Her excuse is that it is unfair on him to make him wait. find that ridiculous, and believe he absolutely could wait.  I said the only reason to give it early is the selfishness of wanting to experience his joy alone without sharing it. AITA?  Edit(s): This blew up quicker than I expected (I couldn't get online for the last hour). And overwhelmingly with YTA responses, many with some unfair assumptions so I want to add some context in my defence although I think it wont change the general outcome. 1. Today is his birthday, although we have other special plans. Next week I'm taking 3 days off work, two of which are for a family trip and the third is a special day for my son. I couldn't get today off work though, and Saturday is his proper party, which I obviously will be there. I have a 1.5 hour commute each way (hence why I don't normally see him in the morning before he gets up for school), but I normally read the bedtime story when I'm home and I video call EVERY evening that I'm not home. I'm not an absentee father, and I'm not just a sperm donor. 2. My wife has bought most of the presents but not all of them. We tend to put things in gift bags not wrap them. Last year it was me that bought the main present, this year there wasn't a main present, it was mostly a few smaller ones because the family trips mentioned in (1) are really his main present. I don't expect her to do all the gift shopping and give all the ideas, I do a share of it. She does have more free time than me, and does more of the childcare than me. That's a problem of our (shared) lifechoices and not something that we can easily change. My long commute is primarily due to decisions on her part. 3. Yes, she said she does this every year, but first and second birthday are not quite the same level of concious response, and 3rd and 4th I am not sure what she gave him in the morning. As I mentioned, last year I got the 'main' present, and that was given in the evening I am definitely jealous if she is giving him presents. I definitely want to be part of the enjoyment of his birthday.  I was hurt and didn't understand why he had to receive the present when I wasn't there. Yep he's 5 years old, and every family is different. I don't remember receiving presents until the whole family was there in the evening. I thought that was normal, and assumed my wife had the same thoughts. We hadn't discussed it, and I was upset for missing out.I think if I knew, then I wouldn't have reacted that way, but it was a shock and I was upset. I still am jealous and have some feelings to work through. I don't like my work situation and commute, but I really don't see a way to resolve it (without significant financial risk that I'm not willing to take in this climate) so will have to suck up my disappointment. I called my wife selfish for getting the joy, alone without discussing it first, or without giving me the chance to join on video call. I guess I need to take the YTA verdict. Edit(again):Too many comments to respond to, and can't respond for at least a few hours so that I can spend time with my son on his birthday!",

        "selftext": "Sorry for any mistakes, I\u2019m a bit drunk and feeling too confident in my english skills. (Edit: I wasn't drunk while this happened. My boyfriend and I had some wine while watching a movie) We\u2019re both men. My family was not happy when I came out but they\u2019ve mostly stopped voicing their opinions openly. I know they still talk about it in private but at least they don\u2019t say anything to our faces. It took some time for them to warm up to my boyfriend but now they actively include him in conversations and my 87 year old grandma called him a \u201cvery lovely young man\u201d while pinching his cheek which is a very high form of approval from her. The one thing they still don\u2019t like us to do in front of them is when we act like a couple. They actually try to keep us separate most of the time to not give us the chance to do something as scandalous as hold hands or kiss. This afternoon we were invited to one of my cousin\u2019s birthdays. At some point my boyfriend and I were alone in the kitchen and I, thinking he looked very cute and kissable in that very moment, committed the ultimate sin. I called him something along the lines of \u201cmy pretty doll\u201d and gave him a quick kiss. Of course one of my cousins had to enter the kitchen at that exact moment and (because she is a 5 year old who probably didn\u2019t know that we\u2019re a couple and has never seen us be affectionate) ran off to excitedly tell the other kids what she saw, which was met with the typical childish reactions of disgust mixed with curiosity. My favorite was actually my nephew asking me if that means that my boyfriend is my wife now. The adults didn\u2019t find that as funny though and I had to listen to my mother berate me for almost 30 minutes. When she finally let me go, my boyfriend asked if we could leave. I told him we\u2019d stay for dinner and leave immediately after. Now comes the part where I might (and probably am) the asshole. I made a point of holding my boyfriend\u2019s hand while we walked back to the table and asked one of my nieces if she\u2019d switch seats so my boyfriend and I could sit next to each other. During dinner I kept asking my boyfriend to hand me things on the table while addressing him by nicknames and giving him a peck on the cheek here and there. To say the mood was awkward would be an understatement. The adults just mostly ignored us and just glared at us every few seconds while the younger kids kept giggling every time I called my boyfriend \u201cdarling\u201d or \u201csweetheart\u201d. My boyfriend was uncomfortable and barely looked up from his plate.  We left immediately after dinner was finished. My boyfriend was very quiet on our way home and when we got home he broke down crying. I comforted him as best as I could but I know it\u2019s my fault that he\u2019s upset as well.  Later this evening, my mother also sent me a long message telling me that \u201cour behavior\u201d was immature and inappropriate and that, until we\u2019d stop forcing our choices on everyone, we wouldn\u2019t be welcome at another family gathering.",

I told him that I\u2019d got up by myself with both children, needed to leave for my appointment in ten minutes and the kids bags still weren\u2019t packed and the car was frozen and I still wasn\u2019t dressed myself. He then asked what he could do to help and I asked him to defrost the car which he did.  When we had dropped the kids off at 9am I started getting myself dressed and he asked I was \u2018even going to have time\u2019 to take him to the primary school (we only have one car and only I have a drivers licence), I said no and was he expecting me to take him and he said yes because I had organised the trip to the primary school.  I pointed out that while I have organised for him to go to the primary school I am not actually going myself. Not only that I have plans, which he knows about, at the same time in a different location in the opposite direction. Also at no point has he asked me for a lift. He says I should have known he would be expecting a lift there as I planned the visit.  In addition to the above, if I was going to give him a lift we would have needed to leave earlier so I could drop him off and make my appoint on time but he didn\u2019t get up with me and get the children out of the house and everything ready so we could do this.  I left for my dentist appointment while he complained he was going to be late and started trying to book a taxi at around 9:10am.  So AITA for not giving my husband a lift to the school viewing?  For info - at 9:05 once we realised he was expecting a lift and I wasn\u2019t expecting to give him one if we had left immediately to drop him off I would probably have been about 5 minutes late to my appointment, maybe just made it if traffic was ok but the ground is frosty today so driving conditions weren\u2019t great.  For info #2 - also, for everyone in the comments who is at an absolute loss for how he was supposed to get himself there without a lift, The school is a ten minute drive from our house and taxis are very cheap where we live, it would have cost him approximately \u00a35 to get a cab there.  Update - ok ok I get it, I\u2019m TA for going to the dentist with a cold haha. Although yes I do take on board all the comments highlighting our issues with communication, going forward we\u2019re going to have a briefing for the next day where we\u2019re clear about who is getting up in the morning, what our plans are and how we\u2019re getting there. Also for those dragging my husband for being a third child, despite how he was acting yesterday he\u2019s usually a very involved partner and father who takes on many jobs around the household and does his fair share of parenting. He used to get up in the night with our daughter and I would do the early mornings which worked well for us however our daughter no longer really wakes up in the night and he has continues to have the lie ins so I think we just need to update our division of labour in that regard. Thanks to everyone who\u2019s posted measured and detailed responses, I\u2019ve found a lot of helpful advice. ",

        "selftext": "Context, my brother and I (30s M and F) live together and we don't have our parents left because they both died within our lifetime. One of our parents had a best friend who we will call, Emily (60s F). Emily has been a wonderful family friend to my brother and me ever since we were kids. And she's become like a second mother to us. However, she's sent us cookies for the last few years as Christmas gifts. And these aren't homemade cookies, these are cookies from some catalog that, to be honest taste like cardboard. And as a result, we don't eat them and they expire to the point where they become unedible because they're so stale. And for me, I truly hate wasting food because it could've gone to people who are struggling to eat. I've tried to donate the cookies as soon as possible many times before, but our schedules get in the way of everything along with Holiday hours as soon as we get the gift. So many areas start either closing too early for us, or some events prevent us from donating so there's a very small time frame in which the cookies can be donated. So as a result my brother and I concluded, we have to tell Emily that while we appreciate the thought and all, we don't want any more of these cookies for Christmas especially because we don't eat them. We feel bad for Emily because she spends her hard-earned money on a gift that goes to waste every year. However, here's where I may be TA. I talked to my therapist about this and she told me, But it's usually the thought that counts you might be hurting her feelings if you tell her. Now to clarify we're not going to ask for another gift or anything, we just don't want her to waste all of her money on stuff we don't even eat. We don't even mind not getting a gift, we just don't want the cookies anymore because they just go to waste, they taste awful, and we can't even find the time to donate them. So Reddit WIBTA for telling Emily in a polite manner that we don't want any more cookies for Christmas anymore? EDIT: WOW! I didn't expect this to blow up the way it did. I'll let my brother know about this information. As I said before we literally don't want anything but at least we can try to find a food pantry or just give every single one away at a place like a supermarket for some random person to find and eat.",

One of my old friends, Jake (31M), has become somewhat of a local celebrity. he started a charity that supposedly helps veterans. Hes been featured in very small local news papers, many praised him his efforts.  At the reunion he kept speaking about  his charity I\u2019ve known Jake for a long time and have had my suspicions. A few months ago, I did some digging and found out that his charity isn\u2019t registered as a nonprofit. He has a website but its a regular company. I confronted him privately before the reunion, but he brushed me off, saying I didn\u2019t understand how difficult it was to run a charity and that the paperwork was just delayed. At the reunion I listened to him talk about all the good his charity was doing, I couldn\u2019t take it anymore. I stood up and asked him to explain why it isn't registered after so long, and why there is no proof that he actually donated money. Jake tried to defend himself, and it was obviously very uncomfortable for him and embarrassing. Some accused me of ruining the night and publicly humiliating Jake, others said they thought it was fishy too. Jake left the reunion early.

        "selftext": "So, last weekend my family had a big dinner at my brother\u2019s (35M) house. His wife (33F) cooked the meal. I\u2019ll just be blunt she\u2019s a lovely person, but her cooking is awful. I\u2019ve tried to be polite and eat it at past dinners, but every time I\u2019ve either gotten sick or just couldn\u2019t finish the food. It\u2019s bland, overcooked, or just plain inedible. This time, I decided to bring my own food. I didn\u2019t make a big deal out of it, just quietly put my dish on my plate when everyone else was eating. But my sister in law noticed and asked why I wasn\u2019t eating what she made. I didn\u2019t want to lie, so I said I had some dietary restrictions which is true to some extent, but not the whole reason. She seemed hurt and asked if I didn\u2019t like her cooking. I tried to downplay it, saying it\u2019s just easier for me to bring my own food because of my diet. Well, now my brother is upset with me, saying I embarrassed his wife in front of the family. My parents think I could\u2019ve just eaten a little bit of her food to be polite. But I didn\u2019t want to go through another meal of forcing down food I couldn\u2019t stomach.",

        "selftext": "Update going to leave it at this thanks to everyone especially to u/YesterdaySimilar2069.  He is right.  Edit: For clarification the request about how the money was spent was because I spent extra for a costume since I was not sure I would be back in time to go pick it out with him. She said she would take him to get what he wanted. So I sent her extra money ontop of the ordered amount.  Reason I asked for where did the money go was because she has not stated the original amount is not enough nor made a request to increase it.  This counts for living expenses also. If she needs more she can ask I have never not send her extra if it is something our son needs. Though the amount in question does cover rent food clothing other general living expenses. So yeah I will question if she states I need more for food when I just sent her money. Which has happened so our order is fairly detailed in what the money is supposed to be used for. Since she has lied in the past. Edit as per requested I sent an extra 400 over because my son wanted a light saber he saw at gamestop which alone was 235 dollars. She did agree verbally that she would take him and get him the stuff he wanted. I sent her the money on the 1st together with the child support payment.   So my son's mother and I did not work out. I travel 6 to 8 months out the year due to work. His mother has primary custody and I do send the ordered amount and some extra when I can.  Fast forward to Sunday I am back for the Holidays. I plan to take my son out for Halloween. He wants to be a Jedi, so I showed him my Jedi costume and asked to see the one his mother bought-I did send her extra to get the costume since I knew I would be back before Halloween just was not sure I would be back in time to get him the costume-she told him that's I was going to buy it.  I was upset but just played it off and said oh that is right and it was in the mail. Thankfully I found a costume  Yesterday.  I did reach out to his mother when I had a moment in private to ask her where did the money I sent go. She told me that I have no right to question what she does with the money. Our child's needs are being met and that is all that matters. She has primary custody and gets majority say. I told her that the money was meant for our child not her.  She was not awarded spousal support. This is where I am getting mixed messages and where I wish to know if what I said made me the asshole.  My mom said I was being the prick by questioning how she was raising our child when I am not around. I do not think I questioning her parenting but I did question how she used the money I sent. She said she would get him the costume.  If she needed extra for something that is related to him I will always send extra. Yes, early on I was more accommodating. While she was not granted spousal support I did cover her rent and also childcare but she took forever to get a job and when she did get a job it was a retail job even though she has a teaching degree.

        "selftext": "So I haven\u2019t been on a proper holiday in about 10 years. This year I\u2019ve booked to go away to Europe for 6 weeks because fuck it, it looks like I\u2019ll never afford a house so I might as well have some fun with my savings. I had a conversation with my housemates at the start of the year and my understanding was they would look after my dog as long as I arranged alternative accomodation for him on 3 of the 6 weekends and during one of the weeks so they could go away. I agreed to this and asked them to let me know when they intended to go away and I would organise something else. Tonight they sat me down and said they no longer want to look after my dog anymore and it was unfair of me to expect them to in the first place as it\u2019s a long time and stops them from going away and living their lives. They also told me the previous conversation was only a conversation and not an agreement. They suggested I send him home to my Mum ($1200 return flight) or drive him home to my Mum (4 day drive there and back; I live in Australia). When I said I didn\u2019t want to spend that money or time and thought he\u2019d be happier staying with them at home with his best dog mate for the majority of the time their response was \u201cwell you\u2019re about to spend 6 weeks in Europe, you can afford it\u201d. Some extra context: I\u2019m a carpenter and last year spent way more than 6 weekends helping them fit out a van for free so they could do trips away/rent it out for some extra cash (it\u2019s a fancy af fit out as one of my housemates is an architect). I genuinely wanted to help and my housemate said all along that one day he\u2019d return the favour in some way. I also look after their dog regularly when they go away (they have also looked after my dog when I\u2019ve gone away up until now). I feel like I\u2019ve been gaslit a little bit as if the first conversation never happened and they don\u2019t understand why I\u2019m annoyed. Am I an asshole? EDIT: This year we have organised a calendar as we are all away a bit so all of us have had notice of any comings and going\u2019s since the start of this year. I\u2019m away for a 6 week block (to clarify they aren\u2019t looking after my dog for this entire time as our agreement was I\u2019d find alternate accomodation for him for some of the time, which I have done). They are away for about 4 weeks total over the course of the year when I will be looking after their dog. Also a lot of people saying I should have offered them money, I offered them $100 a week but they declined.",

        "selftext": "Hi AITA, I have a 5 year old cardigan corgi. He\u2019s an absolute unit, and as my friends say, he\u2019s high in strength/constitution and low in intelligence/wisdom. He often tries to eat things that aren\u2019t safe for him.  I live alone and hired a dog walker I found on Rover to visit him once a day during the work week. Instead of going through the app, I agreed to pay her in cash. She\u2019s generally been great. But, we\u2019ve had a few mishaps like her not telling me when my dog ate and tore up a wooden hand fan. I\u2019ve given her the benefit of the doubt because my dog loves her and enjoys his walks with her.  Last night, my dog vomited up five or so partially chewed, large, bright-orange seeds. They are from the coontie plant and are in the same family as sago palms, which can be fatally toxic to dogs even in small amounts. Unfortunately, they are part of the landscape in my \u201cdog-friendly\u201d apartment complex.  I decided not to wait it out and took my dog to the emergency vet. They admitted him to critical care because the risk of him deteriorating was so high, even though he was in good spirits when I left him.  I messaged my dog walker to let her know what happened, and she insists she never saw him eat the seeds and that she tries to prevent him from eating things on the ground. I know he did not eat the seeds on my watch, because I exclusively took him to the turf-only dog park yesterday, which isn\u2019t near the toxic plants.  This emergency vet visit is costing thousands of dollars. I haven\u2019t brought up the cost to her yet, but WIBTA to request that she contributes to this huge expense? I get it\u2019s my dog, but also I have never let this happen on my watch. I understand it was likely an honest mistake, but also I feel as though it\u2019s really irresponsible to let someone\u2019s dog eat random things off the ground, especially if you aren\u2019t paying close attention.  Edit \u2014 Thanks everyone for your feedback. I will absolutely accept that I would be TA if I asked my walker to contribute to my vet bills. I had several people in my life reach out and suggest I ask, hence this post.  I will not be asking her to pay. I will, however, invest in good pet insurance and will only pay dog walkers through Rover from now on.  I will clarify a few things for the sake of this post. - Yes, I pointed out the unsafe area. - Yes, she knows he will eat things off the ground, but she also knows he is trained and responsive to several commands including \u201cleave it\u201d, \u201cdrop it\u201d, and \u201cwait\u201d.  - This plant is only in specific parts of the complex, which are easily avoidable. - Yes, multiple sources have confirmed this was a life-threatening situation for my dog due to what was ingested.  Edit Part 2: Electric Boogaloo \u2014 Thank you AGAIN for everyone\u2019s feedback. My Hoover of a dog is doing okay, his labs look good and hopefully he\u2019s coming home soon.  A few more things I\u2019ll add: - I will absolutely be investing in a muzzle.- like some of you have suggested, it might be worthwhile to invest in a more vetted walker (instead of Rover)- I am very blessed, and my low rider Unit of a dog\u2019s bills are paid (yes, by some of the very people who asked whether I was going to ask my current walker for compensation)- I walked my apartment complex\u2019s property this morning. On the very far side of my building, there is a line of these palms that were apparently just trimmed, and there are huge piles of the seeds all lined up. Dog walker admitted to letting my Dyson Dog \u201csniff\u201d the seeds, so \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f- it\u2019s a moot point because there are lots of things I will do moving forward to prevent this from happening again (boy I\u2019m dense, I genuinely don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t think of a muzzle in the first place \u2014 I\u2019ve used things like grazing muzzles for my horses before). - Medical scares and renewed agency are one hell of a drug. - I do want to say, I\u2019ve truly been trying my best. I came here for feedback, and I got what I needed to move forward and keep my dumb dog safe. Reddit gives me tough love, and even when it stings, I\u2019m grateful. - I talked to the front office staff about the plants. If anything, maybe some signs can be posted. ",

        "selftext": "So... I am very pregnant right now. Still in the first trimester, but rhe symptoms HIT. I am nauseaus all day and i cant eat anything warm really, i have been living on cold sandwiches and fruits, because that is all my body can tolerate right now. My sense of smell is also hightened.  So, my coworker loves tuna. He eats everything with tuna, specifically a spanish brand with tomate puree in it. I used to like it, before i was pregnant, even though the smell is quite... strong.  The problem is he doesnt keep the tuna refrigerated, he literally pulls it out of his work bag, and especially in the summer, he stinks everything up.  Usually i do notice but i can manage, but lately, i cant stay around that smell. I have barfed way more than i wanted to admit.  Yesterday, after I came back from my barfing i asked him if he could please eat something else. My throat is hurting from barfing everyday and i just cant anymore  Dude got red in the face and left the breakroom ( he left his tuna too).  Now people are calling me an assshole, they told me i am not entitled to dictate what someene else eats.  I tried to explain, but apparently hr is also involved too.  So was I really the AH? Edit : thank you all for your judgements. It's pretty clear I am TA. I still would like to provide some info, as my hr meeting already passed. I forgot to mention some things in the heat of the moment.  1. There is a general consensus in our break room to not heat up fish and to not eat stinky stuff. I don't know why this apparently doesn't appeal to my coworker and he had never gotten introuble because of that.  2. I have absolutely no problems with this coworker. Yes, I should have been much more sensitive and ask nicely, I did ask him once before if he could refrigerate his tuna so the smell wouldn't be overpowering. It was still an assshole move to do infront of my coworkers. I should have asked him again privately. And of course, my sensitivity to smell is not his problem. I just snapped. I did apologize to him.  3. We only have the break room. I cant go anywhere else, cause this is my part time airport job. We are not allowed to eat on the ramp or in the plane, even if it's empty. The break room is inside the security area, because that is where I had to work today. Nowhere else to go. Literally.  4. HR did dismiss the complaint my coworker made. I apologized to him and explained everything to him and that I snapped. He said my pregnancy was not his problem, HR said he shouldn't have eaten tuna in the break room doesn't matter if I am pregnant or not, many people did complain apparently directly with HR.  Again, thank you for your judgement. I did apologize to my coworker, he still kinda seems off but there is nothing I can do about that now.",

        "selftext": "My mother in law (Jane - 59F) came to pay us a visit a couple of days ago. We couldn't make it to their house for Christmas, and she decided to spend a few days with us to catch up. For the context, I (34F) take calls quite often. A day when I'm on call includes my phone ringing at a pretty late hour and me having long conversations over the phone. I often have to just get dressed and leave. So it can be pretty loud. I don't want to disturb my wife (Bella - 33F) or our kids (3 and 5 year old girls) during their sleep. We've got ourselves a system. So for days when I'm on call, I'll go sleep in my reading room downstairs. (It's basically a room with my textbooks, journals, a desk and a bed). Our bedroom and the kids' rooms are upstairs. This way, I don't disturb anyone and I sometimes even catch up on some work. For the days she was with us, Jane was staying in a guest room close to my reading room downstairs. I was on call, and I answered the phone through the night as usual. I had to leave the house at around 3 AM.  The next day when I came home, Jane was very annoyed with me and said she had heard me through the whole night, had heard me talk and pace around the room like a mad woman and heard me get my car. She said she almost did not sleep at all. Bella tried to calm her down but she was really upset and said Bella herself couldn't take being near me which is why she banished me downstairs for these call days.  I apologized and said I was sorry. Jane insisted she wasn't sleeping anywhere near me during my call days ever again and called it a restless night. I said I would be on call for a few more days while she was staying with us and unless she had a plan, I would be sleeping downstiars.  I don't wish to change the current arrangement we have mostly because Bella is exhausted as is and I want her to get as much sleep as she can. Jane said maybe I just needed to be more present and support Bella more as her wife and the mother of our children.  Was I the ah?",

Last night I told the boys to go shower and brush their teeth.  Everyone but my nephew jumped into the shower at the same time which was odd. I asked my nephew if he was waiting for them to leave so he could have the shower to himself and he said no. My nephew said he wanted to go back to his house and shower there. I said no one is at your house except my other nephew who is 20 and it's 9pm. He said he'd walk home and come back. I said I'll drive you home but you won't come back. So you go take a shower now or you go home. He said he wanted to go home so I told my older nephew to pick him up. My brother called and said I was being unreasonable and how my nephew was crying that he couldn't come to my house.",

My partner is very family oriented, which is one of the traits that I fell in love with. However, he is also a momma's boy. He believes that since his parents raised him, he should pay them back by respecting them. However, his way of respecting them is by obeying everything that they say and want.  His parents and I have crossed paths over the years and on most of these occasions, his parents have made off handed comments about my physical appearance, my career, and how I have changed their son. When something goes wrong in their son's life, they are quick to blame me as the reason for his downfall even if I had no involvement in that aspect of his life.  Since my partner and I are seriously thinking about marriage, we have been meeting up with his parents and my parents more often. During one of the dinners with his parents, my potential future MIL said she would be sad if I marry her son because she does not think her & I have a close relationship. I was in shock by her statement and did not respond back. After that moment of silence, she continued to ask me if I agreed that we did not have the best relationship. I think at this point, the inital shock was disappearing and I started to feel hurt by her words. In response to her question, I said that I don't think we have a close relationship because I often feel attacked by her. I then continued to list a few prime examples. As we discussed these examples, the conversation become more heated and turned into a full-blown argument. The last thing I remember saying to her was that if my partner and I ever broke up, it will be all her fault.  Now, she complains to her son about me all the time and refuses to speak to me. Her behaviour is causing some strain in my relationship. AITA for aruging with her? I come from a cultural background where respecting your elders is pretty much the goldren rule. ",

In all honesty I wasn't a perfect dad, I'm a former drug addict (clean for 4 years now) which was the reason for our divorce. However, I've always done my best for my daughter, supporting as much as I could both financially and emotionally. I love her very much but she makes things soooo difficult for me My fiance (39f) and I have been together for two years and we're planning to get married this summer. My fiance is a really lovely and kind person, she tried very hard to be good with my daughter, but she never liked her. She was rude to her many times and when she finally insulted my fiance (she started the argument, and my fiance didn't even raise her tone), my fiance stopped trying. Since then (6 months) I've never brought them together When I mentioned our wedding plans to my daughter, I also told her that she wasn't invited (my fiance didn't ask me to, it's my own call) because I think she'll make a scene there. We had an argument, and now she's mad at me. I also talked to my ex-wife and she also disapproves of her behavior, but she thinks I still should invite her. My daughter doesn't want me to be with my fiance at all, but she has no rational reason. I don't want to upset her, I've already disappointed her enough when I was an addict, but I want to live my life in peace. I'm still not sure about my decision AITA? Edit: First, I want to make it clear that I'm not saying that I'm a perfect dad, I'm saying that I'm doing the best I can because I really am, and I'm aware that it's not enough. I'm not disconnected from reality as some of you imply. I'm aware of the damage I've done to my daughter, and believe me, I'm trying very hard to make amends. I also realized that I was very judgmental towards my daughter. I will apologize to her and invite her to the wedding, but before that I will also offer to go to therapy together.

Usually she will go on about it\u2019s not fair and I try to be supportive but it is just getting worse. I have discussed this with her nothing has changed. The younger one hates being around Kathy right now. My breaking point when she went on a rant about her graduation dinner.

I have spent so much time helping her. I have spent more time with her, I pay for her apartment She couldn\u2019t pass the freshman class, she wanted to be something very math heavy and couldn\u2019t do the math.

My sister gets up at 6 every morning, cleans Joelle\u2019s room, lays out her school uniform, makes her lunch, packs her backpack, wakes Joelle up, then makes her breakfast while Joelle takes a shower and gets dressed.

We have had to be running some tests at the hospital to check for a condition, everything is being coordinated by the neurooncologist. She referred us to an orthopedist, who then asked for a blood test, additional to other blood tests that were being done to him as requested by the neurooncologist. When we mention to the neurooncologist the order for the blood test from the orthopedist, she took the original and said that, since they had to take my son's vein in order to sedate him for an MRI, they could use that to already take the blood for the test that the orthopedist asked for. Up to here, all is well, except for the fact that taking the vein for my son was particularly difficult, he was resisting and it was especially hard to handle for him (and for us as parents as well). Fast forward about a week and I call the neurooncologist on the phone to see if the results from the test had come in, in order to make the appointment with the orthopedist already. To this she answers that now she remembers that she took the order, but lost it, so the test wasn't made. Then she tries to tell me that I also didn't remind her of the fact this test had to be done (to which I replied that it is not my job to keep track of the tests that are being done to him, assuming everything is coordinated by her and trusting she keeps everything on file). My wife then is overhearing this conversation, which makes her extremely angry, and keeps asking me to let her take the phone, so she can speak to the neurooncologist. I refused to let her take over the call because I was a) already taking care of it in the way I considered it should be handled and b) It seemed to me my wife wanted to go nuclear in telling the neurooncologist how big of a fuckup this was, how incompetent she is, etc, etc. I honestly believe that her talking to the neurooncologist would have done nothing to improve the situation, other than maybe bringing her some outlet to vent her anger. It's been about a week since this happened and we just had a fight about it, because we not only disagree on how things were handled on our end, but my wife feels I betrayed her as a partner and co-parent. So AITA for not letting her talk to the neurooncologist? If I am, and I am missing something, I will not hesitate to apologize. But I honestly can't see that what I did was wrong.

We have a special bond  The other day, the kids Amber and I went out to the park. Kate wasn't there because she is a general surgeon and her work-life balance is nonexistent at this point. Kids were playing together in this playground area and Amber and I else were sitting together having a chat. We heard a scream and rushed to the kids. It turns out Chloe fell and was crying holding her arm. We both freaked out. Together, Amber and I took Chloe to the hospital that Kate works at. They took an x-ray of Chloe's arm and everything. After Amber trying multiple times and finally reaching Kate, she came down to the ER. She took a look at the X-ray, talked to the ER doctor, and without letting even the slightest bit of emotion or compassion toward her crying daughter and wife, said it was just a small fracture, that it didn't extend to the joint and would be okay in a few weeks' time with just casting.  The only compassionate thing she did was holding Amber when they got Chloe's little arm into a cast. I got really mad at Kate and said she was downplaying her daughter's broken arm and acting as if nothing was wrong! She simply said kids get injuries like this a lot and there was nothing extraordinary going on here.  I may be TA here because I called her an ice cold insensitive mother. Amber got so mad she practically kicked me out of the ER and said she'd go back home with Kate and the kids herself. She said I'd better apologize to Kate before coming over to their house again.

        "selftext": "Last week, myself and 4 of my children moved into a 4 bedroom house. As there is 5 of us and only 4 bedrooms my teenaged sons are sharing a bedroom. They are 17 and 13. Myself, my 12 year old daughter, and 27 year old autistic son have our own rooms. They boys have shared a bedroom all their life, until last summer when my 22 year old daughter moved out and one of them took her room. Now that we've downsized, they're unhappy about sharing a room again.  The house has two bedrooms and a bathroom upstairs. One of the bedrooms is tiny and is my daughter's room and the other is mine so we can share the same bathroom.  There is also two bedrooms and a bathroom downstairs. One is around the same size as my bedroom and the other is around 5 feet wider. The smaller bedroom is still a decent size with enough room for two double beds and the rest of their furniture. In the end I decided to give my teens the smaller bedroom for a few reasons.  1. My 17 year old is a senior in high school and will be going to college in the fall, at which point my 13 year old will have the room mostly to himself other than school breaks.2. My 27 year old has a part-time job and pays me $150 in rent a month.3. My 27 year old also spends more time at home/in his room than his younger brothers. I'm planning on getting him a couch and his own tv set up so he can have his own living space in the room. My teens are very active and have never spent a lot of time hanging out in their rooms even when they each had their own.4. Although my 13 year old doesn't see his dad, my 17 year old does. He has his own room at his dad's house and although he spends more time at my home he still stays with his dad somewhat frequently. Despite all the reasons I've listed, the teens have expressed that they are unhappy that they have been given the smaller room. They think as there is two of them, they should have gotten the bigger bedroom. My 13 year old is the most annoyed of the two and was texting his older sister complaining. She talked to me about it and took their side and suggested it seems like I'm playing favorites by giving their older brother the bigger room.  I understand with their argument, but also don't think a few extra feet of space is going to heal their frustration of sharing a room again. I willing to listen to criticism about this and possibly change things around. Am I being the asshole and should I switch their rooms before my older son gets too settled?",

We paid for her trip and everything she\u2019ll need, and it was pretty costly. Because of this we couldn\u2019t pay for our niece, 16. Her parents don\u2019t have much expendable money, they are pretty poor, and she was unable to come to this trip. We promised we\u2019d go on another cruise during Summer and pay for her to come. I felt bad we couldn\u2019t bring her, but we wanted our sons gf to feel welcomed. Well, she has been a little difficult. I had met her before and thought she was a lovely girl, but I got a completely different interpretation of her this trip. When she first saw her room, she said she was expecting more and it seemed small. That really rubbed me wrong, but I ignored it. My son told me she came from a wealthy family. My kids were sad their cousin wasn\u2019t here, but I told them to spend time with Morgan. Unfortunately, they\u2019ve been getting into fights. Morgan yelled at my kids because they used an handicap elevator, specifically designed for disabled people. She said it was rude and entitled. My kids pointed out that they got lost and had no idea where they were. They found the elevator and decided to take it up. They said no disabled people were using the elevator but if they were they would have given it up immediately. But Morgan said it was really entitled and shitty of them. I\u2019m not sure I understand her logic here. It seems like she\u2019s starting fights over nothing and I\u2019m confused by she\u2019s parenting my kids. She\u2019s been getting into multiple fights with my daughters, who are exhausted of her. I overheard them talking about how awful she is at a dinner and approached them to tell them to shut up. People can hear them, and we don\u2019t want Morgan to feel unwelcomed. They said they were tired of her. She was super entitled and still complaining that we didn\u2019t spend money on a better cruise or better things to do. (Unbelievable because this was cruise was around 2k each person.) They said I was an asshole for leaving their cousin at home and inviting this entitled person instead. They said their cousin should be here, not this lady. I told them we need to show support to their brothers relationship, someone that could be apart of the family one day. I\u2019m sad to leave my niece home too. AITA here?",

        "selftext": "I\u2019m (M43) a single dad to two twin daughters (F18), Jess and Amy (not their real names). Their mum hasn\u2019t been in their lives since they were about 6 and as a result, we\u2019re a close family and the girls have an extremely tight bond. They couldn\u2019t be any different as people though. Jess is a big extrovert; she loves to party, is out every weekend, has a boyfriend and a big circle of friend. Amy, on the other hand, is introverted, shy, and spends most of her time studying or reading. They still remain really close and I hope that Jess brings Amy out of her shell more and Amy encourages Jess to study more than she currently does. Last weekend, Jess had been invited to a party with a group of friends. Amy hadn\u2019t been and I suggested to Jess letting Amy come as well; I thought it would be good for her to socialise after working hard throughout the week. Jess mentioned it to Amy and when Amy asked me, I told her she should go. They both got ready that evening, Jess picked out Amy\u2019s outfit, and it was great to see some sisterly bonding. At around 2am, I hear a big thud downstairs which woke me up. Jess was carrying Amy, who was clearly very, very drunk. When I asked what happened, Jess told me that Amy had gotten carried away drinking and as she\u2019s not used to alcohol at all, it had a bad effect on her. Jess told me Amy was talking to everyone, flirting with boys, took her top off to expose her bra, drinking shots, and essentially nothing like her character. Jess took her away at 2am to come home. While Amy was vomiting in the toilet, I got annoyed at Jess for allowing her to get in that state as she knows Amy doesn\u2019t drink and Jess had a responsibility to look out for her when she\u2019s on her own. Jess said Amy\u2019s an adult and she can do what she likes, which got me extremely irate and I shouted at Jess as I knew Amy would not have been in that state if Jess wasn\u2019t encouraging her to drink/party. Amy has been extremely embarrassed (as well as hungover) since and has said she\u2019s never planning to socialise with Jess or at school again. I\u2019ve told Jess I\u2019m disappointed in her for allowing this, which she said is completely unfair. Now she\u2019s being distant with both me and Amy. Part of me feels this is justified as I know Jess would have had an influence on Amy, while the other part of me does know she\u2019s an adult who should make her own choices. So, AITA? (Note that we\u2019re in the UK where the legal drinking age is 18).",

        "selftext": "I (33M) have a younger sister (25F). Our parents are dangerous people, so as soon as I was able, I rented out a place so that my sister and I could have somewhere to live. We got out of there when I was 18 and she was 10, and I took care of her until she was able to go to college (she is now in graduate school, doing very well for herself). Basically, I\u2019m not the most well-organized guy. I mean of course I take my job seriously (I work as a paramedic, and I aspire to go to med school soon, and I am responsible for peoples\u2019 safety), but my primary motivation is making a living and breaking the cycle. I don\u2019t put too much effort into things like looking presentable, or cleaning around the house or whatever. I\u2019m too busy for that. So I admit that while my little sister was growing up, she was more often than not the one who washed the dishes and cleaned the floors. Even nowadays, she spends her money on nice clothes for me and whenever she visits my apartment, she scolds me as if I\u2019m a little kid and she cleans up the mess. It\u2019s kind of amusing. So last weekend, my sister visited me, and once again, she rolled up her sleeves and started tidying up the place a little bit while we were chatting. While she was doing that, I jokingly told her that she would make a great housewife, and that she should aim to find a job like a flight attendant or something where she could put her neat-freak talents to use. My sister was sort of embarrassed when I said this, and her face turned red. She went on this whole rant about how this wasn\u2019t what she was going to grad school for, and then she entered my bedroom and freaked out when she saw the new clothes she bought for me, just laid out all messy on the floor. It was enough that she even started crying! She was so exasperated, and all she could say was you're supposed to be an adult. AITA?",

        "selftext": "I (30F) got engaged to Jack (31M) last year.From the start, wedding planning was a nightmare. We were excited to celebrate and begin venue searching, but Jack broke his knee and couldn\u2019t walk for months. During Jack\u2019s recovery, his brother Paul got engaged to Eva. Immediately, the family\u2019s attention shifted. Paul and Eva got an engagement party, they got to tour venues, go dress shopping; we were just...the other ones. By the time Jack recovered, we realized that not only did we not want to compete with Paul and Eva, but that a traditional wedding wasn\u2019t in our budget. It would be cheaper to elope in Greece with close friends and family, then honeymoon there. Happy with our decision, we told the family in May that we would get married in Greece in December. Everyone was excited--for exactly six days, until Paul and Eva shared their date: one month before ours. It felt intentional. Paul has a thing about being the eldest and married first. And surprise, everything then turned to them. Band or DJ? White or beige linens? Who will be the flower girl? Everyone only cared about Paul and Eva\u2019s big wedding, not me and Jack\u2019s. It felt like everything was going wrong. Only one member of the bridal party (Taylor) said she\u2019d go to Greece. Even my mom wouldn\u2019t come. Paul and Eva were determined to upstage us, nobody cared about our wedding, even the bachelorette party sucked (but that\u2019s another story.) So, Jack and I decided in July to do a private courthouse ceremony\u2014something just for us instead of everyone else. Jack and I still eloped in Greece alone (see **EDIT** below.) It was perfect, and we had a little of our budget left, so decided to throw a small reception for friends/family back in the US when we returned. There, we shared our secret: that Jack and I actually married in July. People FREAKED OUT. Eva blurted, \u201cwhat was the point of Greece?\u201d and fumed the rest of the night. Our friends were quiet and kept to themselves. Taylor left early for an emergency. Even my mom left early. Later, Taylor called and said she felt \u201churt\u201d she wasn\u2019t \u201cincluded in the real wedding.\u201d She *was* included; she found out about our real wedding when my own family did. She was invited to the reception and the bach, the two most intimate and expensive celebrations of my life. She used a lot of therapy-talk, like \u201cyour day isn\u2019t about me, I just wanted to be a part of it. But nobody else complained, including my family, who are more important to me than anything. if they didn't feel excluded, why should she? My coworker thinks IATA. She said people traveled for our reception on late notice just to be told they weren't important enough for the real wedding. But nobody cared about our wedding, they just felt entitled to it after the fact. **ETA**: There were 3 events: 1) courthouse (July, just us), 2) ceremony/honeymoon in Greece (Dec, just us), and 3) reception in US with family in Jan. We unfortunately had to uninvite my in-laws and Taylor from Greece after my mom couldn't attend.",

        "selftext": "My husband 40 male was recently asked by his 52 year-old female boss if she could take him out for lunch at Hell\u2018s kitchen. I admittedly was a little upset to hear that he had taken her up on this offer because him and I always planned to go to Hell\u2019s kitchen together. We watch the show together. We\u2019re both fans of Gordon Ramsay and we always talked about going together for the first time one day. The only issue was money saving up for it, but she can afford it easily. His boss lost her husband unexpectedly a few years ago and has one son who she doesn\u2019t get along with. She is very attractive for her age and seems to really favor my husband. Am I the asshole for getting upset with him for accepting this offer, or am I being jealous and dramatic? We\u2019ve been arguing about it for a couple of days now.  Edit to add: thanks for all the responses. I\u2019m 4 years younger than him and in the same field of work. Some additional info\u2026 it is not a work lunch, it is just because and she asked him because she knows he just really wants to go. It is not during business hours it\u2019s on their own time. She\u2019s bringing him to show her appreciation for doing a great job at work. There is no promotion on the line, he\u2019s capped out basically. After reading all the comments I have to say I am definitely more disappointed about the fact my husband and I had planned to experience it together for the first time when we had extra funds. I cannot go as I will be out of town that day with family. However, I was also not invited to begin with. She is paying for the whole meal out of her own pocket. And I will admit that yes, I am weary and a bit jealous of the whole situation. My husband has decided he is definitely going. He has always been faithful that I know of\u2026 so it\u2019s more hurtful that we were suppose to go experience it together. ",

        "selftext": "So, I (25M) recently invited my family over for dinner at my new condo. I\u2019m really proud of this place\u2014it took years of saving, hard work, and sacrifice to get here. It\u2019s small, but it\u2019s mine, and I wanted to celebrate with a nice family dinner. I decided to make homemade spaghetti carbonara. I spent hours on it: crisped pancetta, freshly grated Parmesan, whisked with eggs and pasta water for a perfect, silky sauce. Carbonara is all about timing and texture, so I was in the kitchen paying close attention to every step. I added garlic bread, salad, and even made a cheesecake for dessert. It was a big effort, and I wanted the evening to feel special. Now, I keep a big jar of jellybeans on my coffee table as a treat. I love picking out a few here and there, and I always save the Cream Soda ones for last\u2014they\u2019re my favorite. The jar has lasted a long time, and it\u2019s something I enjoy after a long day. My sister Laura (35F) brought her 7-year-old son, who\u2019s honestly a bit of a handful. He\u2019s not used to hearing \u201cno\u201d and thinks every space is his to do what he wants. My sister has never set limits with him, and growing up, our parents spoiled her too. While I was busy in the kitchen, my nephew found the jellybean jar. I didn\u2019t notice at first because I was trying to get the carbonara just right. After dinner, I went to grab a handful of jellybeans and realized that almost all the Cream Soda ones were gone. My nephew had picked them out, leaving a mess of crumbs and broken bits. I pulled Laura aside and mentioned it, asking if she\u2019d noticed. She just shrugged and said, \u201cOh, he only likes the Cream Soda ones, so he picked those out. No big deal.\u201d I tried to be polite, but I told her that those were my favorites and asked if she could replace them, or at least get me some more of the Cream Soda flavor. She got annoyed and snapped, \u201cHe\u2019s just a kid. You\u2019re seriously this worked up over some jellybeans?\u201d I told her it wasn\u2019t about the jellybeans, but that it would\u2019ve been nice if she\u2019d kept an eye on him or taught him to ask. Laura rolled her eyes and said, \u201cThen don\u2019t leave temptations out if you don\u2019t want kids touching them.\u201d I asked her one more time to either replace the jar or just the Cream Soda ones, but she refused, calling me \u201cpetty\u201d and saying I was blowing things out of proportion. My parents jumped in to back her up, telling me to \u201cdrop it\u201d and that I should \u201cknow better than to have temptations out around kids.\u201d But it\u2019s not just about the money\u2014it\u2019s about respect and boundaries. I put a lot into that dinner, and her response was to let her son treat my place like his personal candy store. Now my family thinks I\u2019m overreacting, but to me, this is about respecting boundaries. AITA for asking my sister to replace the Cream Soda jellybeans her son ate? Edit: I\u2019ll accept my verdict since apparently it is normal these days to allow a child to root through a jar of jellybeans like a hog looking for truffles. What I won\u2019t accept, what I won\u2019t tolerate, is the insults about my competency as a home chef. Let me walk you through it, so you understand why real carbonara takes time and why cutting corners would be a disgrace. First, I went to this authentic Italian market with shelves stacked high with imported goods, where the scent of cured meats fills the air. They carry real pancetta, flown in weekly, and I spent ages with the owner, Domenico, who handpicked the perfect wedge of Parmigiano-Reggiano for me\u2014a rich, nutty block that was almost too beautiful to grate. Next, I stopped at this tiny, family-owned shop that specializes in fresh farm eggs and produce. Carla, the owner, gets these eggs from a nearby farm, and each one is an intense, deep golden color, perfect for a creamy, rich sauce.  Finally, I swung by a Salumeria for semolina flour. It sounds dramatic, but that\u2019s the lengths I go for traditional pasta. The place feels like a rustic old-world bakery, with walls lined in wooden shelves and burlap sacks stacked high. Their semolina flour has a texture and richness that just doesn\u2019t compare\u2014ideal for handmade pasta that holds up with the perfect al dente bite. Back home, I crafted the pasta from scratch. Flour piled on the counter, eggs nestled into a well, kneading it with care until the dough was soft and elastic, a process that took a solid 15 minutes of arm work. Then, I let the dough rest before rolling it into long ribbons, each one dusted lightly with flour, like fresh snow. Finally, I crisped the pancetta, grated the cheese by hand, and whisked the eggs to the perfect consistency. The sauce had to be watched like a hawk\u2014just enough heat to turn it creamy without scrambling, with careful additions of pasta water to reach that glossy, silken texture. So yes, it took hours. And I\u2019m not ashamed to say that.",

        "selftext": "Quick details. Daughter (16) is a junior in high school. She has excelled her entire life at volleyball and plays on a prestigious club team in our area. She is currently being scouted by division 1 universities.  2 weeks ago, her highschool had prom. She went, even though I thought she shouldn\u2019t. She had an out of state tournament that she skipped to go to prom. Other girls on the team skipped their school\u2019s prom for this tournament. I told her what I thought she should do, but I allowed her to make her own decision and wasn\u2019t going to interfere.  She had another tournament this past weekend where, unsurprisingly, she barely played. She normally starts and plays most games but she sat on the bench most of the time for this tournament. She told me that she thinks this is unfair, and she is being benched because she went to prom. She wants me to talk to the coach about her decision and make sure it doesn\u2019t happen again.  I told her what I felt. I flat out told her no I would not talk to her coach. I told her that she is part of a team, and had a commitment to them and she decided to be selfish and go to a silly dance. She argued with me saying how this is a special occurrence. I reminded her 2 things. 1) That other girls on the team prioritized the tournament over their proms. And 2) she\u2019s lucky to be as talented as she is, and she will most likely not pay for college. This is an opportunity all those prom goers would probably love to have. I warned her this would happen, and she decided not to listen to me.  She is still upset with me; I told her I hope she learned something about being part of a team. My husband thinks I am wrong because prom is important to a teenager and thinks the coach is being unfair. But I have 0 issue with what the coach did. ",

        "selftext": "For some context my husband Peter (33 m) and I (31 f) have been married for five years. He is from Ukraine while I am Canadian, but we both currently live in Latvia. We have two kids together, Buck (4 m) and our newborn daughter Lina (3 weeks f). Since I have given birth to Lina I have had severe postpartum depression. When I had Buck it was the same, but I thought it would get easier since this is my second birth. A few days ago my family showed up on my doorstep. There were my three brothers, my mom, my dad, and my auntie. I was very surprised since I live in Latvia and they live all the way in Canada. I invited them in and asked why they were here. They told me that they planned this trip as soon as they found out what day my due date was. They said that they knew how bad the last pregnancy was (it was a high risk c-section) so they wanted to visit and help me to settle in with my new baby. I asked to talk to my mother in another room. I told her how I was going through some pretty bad postpartum and I didn\u2019t know if I was ready for people over. She apologized for just showing up, and told me that she also thought that my postpartum wouldn\u2019t be as bad this time. I found out that their trip was only two nights long. I thought that I could do it, so I told her that everything was fine. We went back into the room with the rest of my family. I explained that I was having very bad postpartum. I said how I would try my best to let them be with the baby but I couldn\u2019t make any promises. Soon Peter got home from work with Buck. Lina started crying so I went to the nursery to bring her downstairs with me. People instantly were all over me and Lina, trying to get a look at her. I was very overwhelmed but Peter helped keep everyone a few feet away from me. Everyone wanted to hold her, but I told them that after dinner I might let them. I made up a lie saying that Lina doesn\u2019t really like new people. We ate take out for dinner and I found out that my family were going to a hotel to sleep. The rest of the night went smoothly along with most of the next day. I even let my mom and auntie hold Lina. Things started to get bad when my youngest brother asked to hold her but I told him that I didn\u2019t feel comfortable with that. He then started to get angry, calling me over protective and rude. He said how he just wanted to hold his first niece. My two other brothers have kids too, but they only have boys. I told him that saying that wouldn\u2019t make me any more comfortable, and if he wanted to hold her then he would either have to wait until I was ready or until the next time that they visited. The room got tense as my brother and I stared at each other. He ended up leaving with most of my family. Only my mom and auntie stayed behind. This all happened two days ago. Everybody left my house yesterday. Now my family is split. One side says that I shouldn\u2019t have been so harsh while the other agrees with me. So AITA? ",

        "selftext": "My friend and I are both 27F and have been friends since we were 8 y/o. I got married this past April and she was a bridesmaid in the wedding. About 9 months out from the wedding I learn from my MOH that because this friend doesn't want to pay for a hotel room, she instead had texted the entire bridal party (excluding me and the groom) about booking a large airbnb together with their s/o's. MOH said the group text indicated that this airbnb was for the bridal party but not the bride and groom. This airbnb plan ultimately fizzled out, but I texted my friend/bridesmaid to just to talk with her about how it bothered me that she was trying to make new plans for my wedding party for my wedding weekend without saying anything to me or my now husband. She was very defensive and told me it wasn't a big deal, and dismissed my feelings entirely. The conversation ended and we just didn't have a reason to talk for a while.  Fast forward to my bachelorette weekend, and lots of wine, and she made some comment about the lodging for my wedding weekend and I snapped at her in front of everyone. I told her that she was selfish and only cared about what she wanted. Later that night we tried to hash things out and I apologized for snapping at her but tried to explain that I did think she was selfish for trying to change my wedding plans without telling me and then also dismissing me when I tried to talk with her about it. I told her it hurt my feelings that as a friend of almost 20 yrs she could care so little about my intentions and opinions of my wedding. When I said she wouldn't appreciate it if the roles were reversed, she told me that she really couldn't entertain that hypothetical bc she wasn't seeing anyone. We smoothed over the conversation that evening but I'm not totally sure that either of us saw the other person's side. Then leading up to the wedding everything seemed normal again with us and she was enthusiastic about the wedding and left me a thoughtful card on the day of.  Now that the wedding is over she doesn't speak to me, she didn't tell me she was coming to town multiple times, or that she's moving to the area that I live in. Come to find out she told another friend that she was just getting through the wedding and had planned to stop talking to me after.  AITAH for telling her that was selfish?",

I don't know the specifics but when he came home, he wasn't cleared for work or driving by his doctors and his case was still being reviewed for monthly compensation. My husband didn't want him to dip into his savings just yet so he walked dogs, babysat, and did similar odd jobs to get some money to pitch in with gas and groceries here and there when he could. We discussed it with Andy that whenever he did start getting a stable income he would have to start paying rent and helping with bills. Andy agreed. Andy had his case settled and received a back payment for the time he was discharged to current time.  Upon learning that, I gave Andy a list of expenses for the time we supported him, namely rent for the 15 months and a portion of utilities. It came out to roughly 7k. Andy told me I was more or less an asshole for keeping a running tab of everything while he was at his lowest, but he paid me the money right away. However, he told my husband that he'd be finding someplace else to live and started packing everything up and had a friend take him to put his things in storage. My husband is furious and said I should've talked to him before deciding to charge his son back rent in his house. I told him I live here too and contribute to the finances and that Andy is an adult, not a child or someone just turned 18, he's practically a tenant. 465 a month was better than Andy would find anywhere else. My husband said it's not about the amount, but nickel and diming Andy like that was just scummy. AITA?",

We had a very rocky marriage, during which I was a stay-at-home mom, and I struggled a lot financially afterwards. Because of this, during our divorce, my ex-husband and I agreed that our daughter would live mainly with him and I received alimony payments from him for about 4 years after our divorce. For the first several years after the divorce, my daughter would stay with me every other weekend and several holidays (the specific holidays depending on the year), and I always enjoyed our time together, but it would often feel like she didn\u2019t want to see me. She was never interested in any activities or occasions that I planned for us and normally when I called to talk to her, she would be busy with school, an extracurricular activity, or something else. Usually when she would spend the night with me, she\u2019d ask about the divorce and why her father and I aren't together anymore. I always tried to be as honest as possible with her but I could tell the divorce had been hard for her and when she started high school she stopped visiting altogether. She and I have been low contact for the past few years, and this past weekend we had an argument regarding her graduation. She\u2019s graduating from high school this June, and I texted her to ask about the details. She responded with a very passive aggressive text asking if I would actually come and how she didn\u2019t want to waste a ticket. I wasn\u2019t sure where it was coming from, so I called her and she started ranting about how I was never around, and that I always blamed her father for everything, and how I cared about my students more than her (I\u2019m a high school teacher). I interrupted her and told her that she knows nothing about what happened between her father and I. I told her that she made her choice to stop visiting and not to answer when I call her and that she couldn\u2019t blame anyone else for that and she hung up. About an hour later she sent me a long text about how much I hurt her and that she didn\u2019t want me at her graduation and that I \u201cneeded to change\u201d. Since that night, I\u2019ve gotten several messages from my ex-husband\u2019s family about how I\u2019m a terrible mother and how I should\u2019ve been more involved when my daughter was younger, and I\u2019m not sure how to handle this.

        "selftext": "I (35M) have a friend, Steve (48), who accidentally got Stephanie (44) pregnant about a decade ago, and they now have a daughter, Chloe (9). I met Steve last year at a park while walking my dog, and we became friends since he lives nearby and also has a dog. Steve\u2019s a good guy who cares deeply about his daughters (he has three adult daughters from another relationship). Whenever I\u2019m with Steve and Stephanie calls, she often seems ridiculous. Sometimes she calls over minor things; other times, she\u2019s frantic, like she\u2019s on the verge of a breakdown. She\u2019s a helicopter parent and very possessive of Chloe. Stephanie doesn\u2019t let Chloe visit Steve alone. The first time Steve ever took Chloe anywhere without her was recently\u2014and only because one of his adult daughters went with them to a movie. Steve said Stephanie blew up Chloe's phone the entire time. Steve wanted to teach Chloe to ski, but Stephanie told him it wasn\u2019t appropriate for a 9-year-old and that he needed to find a better activity. Every idea Steve has for activities gets shut down with an excuse. Despite this, Stephanie often makes passive-aggressive comments like, \u201cCome over here and be a dad,\u201d even though Steve gives her at least $250 a month (voluntarily, no court order) and spends multiple evenings a week at her place to be with Chloe as that's Stephanie's idea of visitation. She makes it seem like he isn't a good father or something when it is\u00a0**she**\u00a0that doesn't really let Chloe hang out with friends,\u00a0**she**\u00a0that bought Chloe a smartphone due to her incessant need to always be able to contact her,\u00a0**she**\u00a0who isolates Chloe from Steve's side of the family and\u00a0**she**\u00a0who is always worrying about making rent, yet only has a part-time job and spends money that should be going towards other things on weed. When Steve brought up to Stephanie that he thought that 9 is way too young to have a smartphone, his concerns were all ignored. When he brought up that he doesn't like Chloe being around her when she is smoking weed due to secondhand smoke, the issue was disregarded. Recently, Stephanie moved, and I helped Steve while she mostly stood around watching. Her place looked like it was recently featured on *Hoarders*. That day, Stephanie took Chloe to the ER for **the flu** as Urgentcare won't see her without insurance. Later, I told Steve about the Affordable Care Act and how he could get insurance for himself and Chloe. The next day, Steve asked Stephanie for Chloe\u2019s social security number to enroll her, and Stephanie freaked out, saying, I don't even give Chloe's SSN to the state! She claimed Chloe was already insured and when asked by Steve who the insurer was, she mumbled something vague. I directly asked, \u201cWho is she insured through then?\u201d and Stephanie snapped, yelling, \u201cWE ARE HER PARENTS!\u201d When we left, Steve said, \u201cSee what I\u2019m dealing with? How she snapped at you?\u201d I replied that she had a point\u2014it\u2019s not really my business. What do you think? Was I an asshole for asking who insures her child? EDIT: I wanted to add that I have already advised him to get an attorney. He mentioned once that his brother is in huge debt over attorney fees to get time with his own daughter. I let him know that many attorneys will work with you and let you pay in monthly installments and he was very receptive. I was going to include that in the original post but was limited to 3000 characters. Why he hasn't done this already? I don't know, I mean I certainly would have long ago. Also that about $250 is in addition to him paying a big portion of her rent every month. SECOND EDIT: Wanted to add that I agree that my buddy should have taken care of this sooner. He stopped smoking weed shortly after I met him and has gotten and new job and is getting his life together, but Stephanie has made not made it easy for him to be a good dad by alienating Chloe from him and his side of the family. Her need for control is so great that she won't allow Steve to spend time with the child alone, and she wouldn't give the SSN to Steve because she perceives it as getting one over on her. When Steve asked her for the SSN so he could insure Chloe at **no cost to her** she should be happy to oblige, not adversarial. She isn't working at co-parenting and **he clearly is.** As far as child support what more should he be doing? He already pays a big portion of the rent and whenever she calls him for money, he never says no or doesn't give her money when she asks so I'm not sure what more he should be doing. ",

I argued that I don't want them to be constantly dependent on their aunt because, even though we are family, she is still just their aunt and not a parent. But we keep going back to the same topic about how I took away our kids' gifts/money that were helping them. According to my wife, this is her sister's indirect way of giving us financial aid, as we're not asking from her.

We have our differences but I do love him and do want a family one day. He\u2019s 28 I\u2019m 25. So today is Easter and since my boyfriend is catholic (well culturally anyway) his family had a get together. I had met his family before and while I wouldn\u2019t say there is any ill will between them and me. They are just very different from me and my family and really anyone I\u2019ve ever grown up with. I\u2019ll just say to me it\u2019s odd to see a family gathering where people are openly smoking weed and all the guys are almost falling to the floor drunk. My family would never be that way. I\u2019m not judging I just grew up differently. But that\u2019s all besides the point. My boyfriend has a younger sister who is I believe 19 or 20. And I suspect she is on the spectrum. I actually enjoy talking to her she\u2019s funny and smart and witty. She is basically forced to be at these family events even though I know she doesn\u2019t enjoy being there. She\u2019s also a picky eater and doesn\u2019t like vegetables or spicy food or anything too extreme. Unsurprisingly her family pressure her to eat whatever is available. My boyfriend today was being particularly obnoxious about it. He took her plate and ate her chicken and potatoes. Leaving her just the stuff she doesn\u2019t like. He said he was tired of her trying to be different and she needs to grow up and be normal. She started crying and it felt like everyone was just watching and no one did or said anything. A backyard full of adults and they all let this happen. So I finally snapped and yelled at him. I said wtf was his problem. To leave his sister alone and stop being an asshole. The entire family went silent. I felt so embarrassed in that moment. My boyfriend just stared at me for a second before walking over to the table his uncles and cousins were playing cards and they all just busted out laughing. No one talked to me for the rest of the day. I just spent my time with his sister. I was just shocked that her own parents would ignore all of this.  After about an hour or so I texted my boyfriend that I wanted to leave and he sent me a thumbs up emoji. So I left. I came home and told my roommates about it and they agreed it was messed up how things went down but also suggested that I may have made things awkward for the family. Does this make me an asshole?",

        "selftext": "Kayla and I (both 32 F) have been friends since elementary school. When she got engaged this Christmas she didn\u2019t ask me to be a bridesmaid because it was an automatic given. I love Kayla but the problem is that her wedding is taking place overseas and would cost more than I think is reasonable. Kayla\u2019s fianc\u00e9 is from a tiny, far-north Scandinavian town, it is where their wedding is happening. A couple weeks ago due to some family pressures they changed the date from Midsommar next year to Midsommar THIS year, about 4 months away. Between flights, the hotel (most everything in town has already been booked for Midsommar including every spare room and couch at his families home so the rooms at the final available stays are around $300 p/n for the 7 days of wedding events), the rental car, the bridesmaid dress, the full traditional outfit required to be worn for some the the events, pet boarding, as well as general incidentals and we are looking at a minimum $8000.  Kayla was very apologetic about the change when she announced it but has not acknowledged just how big of an impact this is. My husband and I have good jobs and are lucky that we don\u2019t have to worry about the day to day expenses of life, but we do still have to be thoughtful and save for any larger purchases or travel. For the last 4 years we have been saving for our tenth anniversary trip, a 3 week tour around Japan, and had just booked flights when the date change was announced. Kayla didn\u2019t know I had just booked flights and when she broke the news she actually said \u201cyou\u2019re so lucky, you\u2019ve been saving all that money for a vacation anyway!\u201d Here is where I might be the asshole. I also had a destination wedding. My husband and I got married in Alaska right out of college when most of our friends, including Kayla, didn\u2019t have particularly good or secure jobs. We know now this wasn\u2019t exactly fair of us but we split the rental of a big house with all our friends and flights to Alaska aren\u2019t anywhere near the $2k each it would cost us to fly to Kayla\u2019s wedding. I\u2019m scared that if I tell her the truth of why we can\u2019t go, it\u2019s too damn expensive, it will ruin our friendship. I could see why it would. She was a bridesmaid for me while far less financially secure than we are now and she knows we have a lot of money saved for travel. I fear she would question if our friendship is not worth cancelling our Japan plans and flights. Our friendship means a lot to me but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to plan a wedding this expensive to attend and expect me to cancel our dream trip to accommodate it. I don\u2019t want to risk it so my idea was to lie and say we have to do a major home repair (fixing the foundation maybe) that will cost all of what we have saved plus more, then when it did come time for the Asia trip say we were gifted the trip by my husbands parents. I know that there is a risk she would find out the truth and be even angrier, is that risk worth it to avoid telling her the truth?",

Recently my dad has been more hostile toward me, repeatedly commenting on my appearance and diet. He said that I need to eat more (he eats a lot at meals and for snacks, whereas I eat a moderate portion), and he says that working out everyday is bad for my health. I just do 20 minutes of cardio and free weights mostly at home, but he says that too much exercising will ruin my body. He even scolds me when I occasionally skip a meal because I'm not that hungry. What he says has been getting on my nerves lately. Last night I was going to the basement to exercise, and my dad told me that I already exercised everyday for the past 6 days. I said that I like to workout daily, and he said that I am going to end up like my sister (18f), who developed an eating disorder in middle school and because of that is short and underweight up to this day (though she recovered around 9th grade). He said that for a long time she ate just 1 or 2 meals a day, and spends 2 to 3 hours exercising each day. (In fact I only skip a meal once in a while, and I exercise about 30 minutes per day). He kept saying that my behavior is unhealthy, and that I need to take a break from exercising and not obsess over my appearance I explained that I'm not obsessing over my appearance, but I just want to stay healthy and de-stress regularly, and maintain heart and lung strength. He still said that I am giving him flashbacks to when my sister had an eating disorder, and he said that he cannot repeat this mistake. He said that if his children have eating disorders, it reflects on his failures as a parent. I reiterated that I don't have body image issues, and that I just value physical fitness. He kept lecturing and criticizing me, and finally I told him that he might just be jealous of my appearance because of how much he has been commenting on it lately. I said that if he wants to be healthy he should eat less and exercise a few times a week, and that it's better to be fit than overweight or underweight. He got really angry and said that he cares about me and doesn't want me to have disordered eating or body image issues, and that it's a red flag that I exercise every single day. I said that I work out because I care about my health, not so much my appearance, and that if he was in shape he wouldn't have been so sore about it.",

        "selftext": "This just came up casually in conversation with my(37f) mother in law (68f). In reference to meeting her at the waterfront near our home, I was asking her to narrow it down a little when she said my wife (40f) could look for her location to make it easier.  Assuming she was mistaken, I said she would have to share location for that to work and she informed me that she and my wife have that set up 100% of the time. I laughed and said that\u2019s so unhealthy.  Got off the phone and asked my wife to confirm and she said yes, I asked \u201cDoes that mean the opposite is also true? Are you sharing  your location with her 100% of the time?\u201d She said yes,  I was being snarky cos I thought she would agree with me. I said something like \u201ccome on, you must think that\u2019s weird. Not even when you say it out loud?\u201d  Anyway, she\u2019s furious with me, says I\u2019m being mean, she\u2019s crying and left the house furious with me.  Am I the asshole here? I feel terrible about having blundered in and upset her , and will definitely apologise for the insensitivity as soon as we talk.  But please someone tell me - is the maps thing normal and I\u2019m the crazy one?  UPDATE: Wow, that was an absolute deluge of responses. Truly wasn\u2019t expecting it to have that much engagement. Posting to hopefully wrap things here because I really need to stop reading this for a while. Just going to address a couple of things quickly: 1. Thanks so much to the people that came here sincerely to give me a different perspective on the location sharing thing. My takeaway from lots of people giving their input is that the 24/7 sharing is a much more passive activity whereas I think my experience of using things like dropping a pin or sharing an Uber ride, I think my perception of it is like more of an active thing.  I get there is a range of perspectives and comfort levels on this and I clearly need to make a bit more space for that.  2. I\u2019M A WOMAN! \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 Despite me including it in the OP , lots of people did miss the fact that my wife and I are in a queer relationship. Really no offence taken, it\u2019s an easy mistake to make when reading through these quickly. Wanted to highlight it so that hopefully anyone who visits this subsequently doesn\u2019t get into a whole \u201cI don\u2019t get it because I\u2019m a man\u201d conversation.  3. I behaved in a shitty way to my wife. I thought I was clear on the fact that I knew I was the asshole for my response/attitude/how I said it but I obviously didn\u2019t do a great job of that. My focus was more on the location thing and I definitely saw that my take was definitely in the minority about location sharing.  4. Lots of people asked follow up questions about my wife and mother in law and people\u2019s health, back stories with lots of further questions about their relationship, my relationship with parents etc. I\u2019ve responded to questions about my own relationship with my mum a few places in the thread but I really get the ick at the prospect of adding more personal info about them.  5. Everyone saying: what if something happens? What if she gets in a car accident? What if *all the worst possible things? I\u2019d respectfully ask all of you to stop it. I\u2019ve gotten the point  you\u2019re making but please stop making me visualise the worst possible things happening to the best person I know.  6. Last but not least, I had already apologised on the phone when I posted this. When my wife came home I apologised again , in person, and she was gracious enough to accept my apology. A little later I told her about this post and told her the internet has decided that I suck and she\u2019s right so that gave us something else to giggle about it.  Thanks everyone xx",

        "selftext": "I (F35) just had an argument with my husband (M37) over this, but posting from an alt for anonymity. FYI, my entire job experience since I was 17 has been spent in male-dominated fields.  Think abnormally minuscule female to male ratios in almost every job I\u2019ve had since then. This is relevant later.  He was telling me about his day as a warehouse manager (normal, I enjoy hearing about his day). Apparently, over last week he interviewed and extended the offer to what will be the first female in his facility.  For some background, I will preface this by saying that he is a manager specifically to help the people who work under him. He\u2019s a fantastic dude, empathetic, feminist, caring, will go ten extra miles. I would recommend literally anyone work for him, even my own children if applicable. I have only the highest regard for him. Which is why this caught meSo off guard! He was telling me (obviously, I wasn\u2019t there, so all the info I have is what he said he told the potential hire in the interview) that \u201chis only concern with hiring her is that she would be coming into an all male environment, they will make off color jokes, they will give her grief at first for being new and being under the metrics then when she inevitably crushes them (she did better than any other applicant so far PERIOD on the physical/ability assessment) she would get shit for that too, some of the guys might try to pick her up, etc.  but that he was (and genuinely is!!) trying to change the culture.  If any of you are female and have worked in a male-dominated field, this is pretty much standard operating procedure. It\u2019s the same nearly everywhere I go and personally having someone tell me that it\u2019s their only hang up to hiring me would be mildly offensive. I didn\u2019t say this however, I just mentioned that he was mansplaining the environment to her. I intended to say maybe he should approach it from a position of \u201chey I know you\u2019re probably used to dealing with this, let me know asap if anyone crosses the line. We\u2019re working to change it!\u201d but he *immediately* jumped down my throat.  Apparently, to him calling him a \u201cmansplainer\u201d is on par with calling someone the N word. To me and the other women I\u2019ve talked to, mansplainers are just common; likely generally with good intentions, but will still try to tell you things you already know. In other words, a very gentle AH.  He said it\u2019s a slur and I crossed a huge line. I was using what I thought was a mild word for someone affably annoying that happens all the time. But I might be TA because maybe it registers high on the \u201chorribly offensive \u201c scale and I didn\u2019t realize it?  Also he said the actual conversation went very differently than the info he shared with me, which I makes sense as he\u2019s not usually that tone deaf. I was just trying to provide the female side of the story based on my own experience. AITA for using the term \u201cmansplain\u201d to describe what my husband told me he said to a female interviewee? Edit to address some things I saw in the comments (I promise I\u2019m reading them all, I just didn\u2019t expect so many!), sorry it was written at 3am right before I went to sleep so I missed some things: I haven\u2019t used this account in a LONG time, the husband referenced in past posts/comments is my ex (not because of gender issues). This is my current husband of about 1.5 years who is definitely male.  He is working VERY hard to change his warehouse\u2019s culture, but he\u2019s only been there 5 months and there\u2019s a myriad of things to fix; it all takes time. He is genuinely concerned about it though, which is why I even said something in the first place because I know he cares about making the woman feel welcome and heard. She currently works as one of 2 women in a warehouse of 90 (so she definitely knows what it\u2019s always like as well in that environment, and she said this to my husband as well).  HE is the one who compared \u201cmansplainer\u201d to the N word, not me. That\u2019s kind of the point of my post, to me it\u2019s an everyday adjective, not positive in nature but not a huge deal. To him, he said it was on par with calling a black person the n word. ",

        "selftext": "My (29F) daughter is five months old and goes to a daycare at my husband\u2019s (32M) workplace. My mother in law also works at the same place so she has easy access to the daycare. At least once a week she goes and spends 30 minutes to an hour just playing with my daughter. This rubs me the wrong way for so many reasons. As a mom, it frustrates me that she thinks it\u2019s okay to just drop by whenever without at least saying something or asking (I actually just found out while writing this that she tells my husband but nobody communicates it with me). As a former daycare worker, I would have hated having someone just come in and spend time with a child because now not only do they have infants to watch, but now they have to work around a fully grown woman and make sure that she isn\u2019t taking pictures/videos of other babies as well. I think my biggest issue is honestly that some days she gets to spend more awake time with my daughter than I do and I know that\u2019s a horrible reason to be frustrated with someone but it is what it is. Would I be the asshole if I asked her to stop visiting daycare so frequently? She comes to our house and gets to spend several hours with my daughter at least once a week so it\u2019s not like daycare is the only time she gets to see her.   ETA: Yes. I know I\u2019m the asshole for being jealous. After talking with my husband, I\u2019m realizing a lot of these feelings are based on big emotions from being exhausted and PPD. I don\u2019t hate my mother in law. This is my first and probably only child and she\u2019s my rainbow baby so I\u2019m very protective. For those of you that politely told me I\u2019m the asshole, thank you. For those of you that told me I need to see a therapist, already seeing one for my chronic depression and added postpartum depression so I\u2019m good. I\u2019m going to stop reading comments now and go snuggle with my baby that just got home. ",

        "selftext": "I, 38M, am the solo breadwinner of this house. I have a wife 35F and a daughter 5F. Me and my wife has been planning this family vacation to Venice for months. For context, my daughter is very little and she needs constant attention or she will get into trouble. Venice has always been my wife's idea of a romantic city, so it's been her dream to go there. However, we can't just leave our daughter at home. We initially wanted to leave her at my MIL's house, but she wanted to come with us and my MIL said that it was her dream to visit too. My wife was very supportive of this idea, but I was more reluctant. My wife planned everything, booking the hotels and the restaurants. However, to my dismay, she booked 1 rooms of 2 queens instead of two rooms with two kings. I planned for this to be a romantic getaway, and did not want my daughter in the room with us. We could easily afford two rooms, but my wife wanted to keep an eye on her as well. To make matters worse, my MIL was constantly in my space. She also had to share all of my wife's expensive products (facewash, shampoo, lotion, etc). My daughter likes to sit on our bed when me and my wife are gone to the city, and I come back to see that MIL was sitting on our bed too. It is very unhygienic to me and I don't like that she was sitting on the bed that me and my wife share, as I am a very private person. She also rummaged through our suitcase looking for a hair tie, and it really irked me that she did so without asking me. I don't like the thought of her looking through our stuff when we're gone, so I locked it. The final straw was when I woke up in the morning, I saw that MIL has yet again, forgotten something. For the last few days, she's been sharing the same toothpaste as me and my wife! I don't like the thought of her putting her tooth brush close to (or even on) the toothpaste nozzle and I was ill the more I thought about it. I asked MIL if the only reason she came was to freeload off of me and my wife, as she didn't pay for any of the expenses (hotel, amenities, food), only her own plane tickets. I said that I've asked her politely several times to stop using my wife's stuff, especially because I share it with her and it's very inappropriate. My MIL was very upset and told my wife, and my wife screamed at me. I was very angry that the trip that I paid with MY OWN MONEY was now ruined, and I changed the date of my plane ticket and went straight home. My wife has called me several times afterwards, screaming at me and saying that our daughter is upset. I feel bad that our daughter was caught in the situation, but it was really not acceptable what my MIL did and I had to set some boundaries before it gets worse. My wife has her own card and enough money to stay there. I'm not sure about her plans about staying or not. I've been ignoring her calls to take sometime for my own mental health. Edit: Thank you to everyone that responded. I'm reading through each response carefully and I have realized my mistakes. I'm taking tonight to write a sincere apology and I will be calling my wife first thing in the morning tomorrow. Thank you again. I love her more than anything and I want to make amends. FINAL UPDATE: I just called my wife to deliver my sincere apology. I am writing this with a heavy heart. She has blocked my number, and my MIL informed me that she will be looking into divorce proceedings. I have never thought about this happening, and I am at a loss of what to do. I have failed our family, as a husband and as a father. I am not angry at my wife for this decision, but I still cling to the hope that I can turn this around. I am about to lose the love of my life, over a stupid mistake that I made. I was not rational when I stormed off. She did not deserve any of my attitude. I am praying at this moment that after sometime off and after I change myself for the better, she will reconsider this divorce. I am going to contact a therapist and marriage counselling after posting this. I feel myself spiraling and I don't want to think how I ruined my life in the span of these 48 hours. Again, thank you to everyone that responded. I will be logging off for a while and work through my thoughts. I don't know what to say. I don't know what to do next. All I know is that I have lost the love of my life, and I have no way to contact her. I don't know how I'm going to handle this. My world has just come crashing down. I'm sorry Maria.",

        "selftext": "Okay. My boyfriend (27m) and I (26f) have been together about two years now but on and off since high school. We\u2019ve always felt like end game & end up together. But I love him and our baby (1m). This is my second baby. During our last off I was with my ex; who was so abusive to me that it gave me PTSD which my current bf knows a bit about. So I\u2019m protective over my kids. Always have been that way to be completely honest I\u2019m more of a reserved person. He is so trustworthy.  So a last night we went to a chain restaurant for his cousin (22m) birthday let\u2019s call him Cousin with most of his family so about 15 of us total. Now I need to give you context. Cousin has a girlfriend (21f) let\u2019s call her GF. Never met her. Heard of her twice in the two years maybe. But Cousin moved her down here from a different country. Now before yall get defensive in the comments we\u2019re the same ethnicity. Now Cousin goes to this country quite frequently. Don\u2019t know if this is the same girlfriend from last year. My boyfriend can\u2019t tell me cuz he doesn\u2019t even know.  Get to the restaurant get out the car say hi to Cousin & GF stands there outside our car my boyfriend is with our baby in his car seat. No hi no intro nothing immediately she goes for my baby. I say nothing (I\u2019m trying). My boyfriend had met her boyfriend once I believe since she\u2019s moved down here. My boyfriend hands over my baby. I say nothing. He\u2019s in a car seat that\u2019s fine with me.  I get in the restaurant. She\u2019s got my baby in her arms. Mom rage immediately activated. Any mom knows this. Why is a stranger I don\u2019t know touching my baby. I\u2019m already sketched out bout them carrying him in a car seat. We get in say hi to everyone my boyfriend knows I\u2019m upset he can see it. I say nothing. His grandma can see it and tells me to sit with her. I\u2019m quiet.  Couple minutes into the dinner I realize we don\u2019t have my sons bottle. I go to the car to  get it cuz I need air. I can\u2019t find it. I ask my boyfriend to help me find it. He comes out. Still sees I\u2019m upset asks a second time he keeps on asking as I tell him we can talk about it later. But he won\u2019t drop it so I tell him why I\u2019m upset. He proceeds to tell me how I\u2019m overreacting and I\u2019m the ONLY one with the problem. \u201cYou are  the only one that has a problem with her\u201d (I do start cry cuz im hormonal still it\u2019s not funny.) I can hear those words over and over in my head. We can\u2019t find the bottle. He goes inside leaving me outside alone teary eyed and upset. I call my mom to calm down. Ask if I\u2019m overthinking it and she reaffirmed me I was not. I text him I\u2019m going to the bathroom no response at this point in debating leaving with my son. But I can\u2019t cause a scene so I mediate a bit and go back. Finish the dinner and he acts like all is fine. We never talk about it again. It\u2019s the next morning but his words are engraved in my brain. He changed how I now look at him. He\u2019s LITERALLY DEFENDING A STRANGER INSTEAD OF ME. No apology. Am I the A**hole or overthinking?",

        "selftext": "My son (he\u2019s 8) has cerebral palsy. One thing we taught him is never to look down on himself. While we recognize he has limitations, and we make accommodations for him, we make sure he knows he\u2019s not defined by his disability and that his disability doesn\u2019t make him lesser than anyone else. As he grows older, we try to teach him to be more independent, as much as someone his age should be. He is 8 years old now. He\u2019s a smart kid and usually gets the highest grades in his class. He is liked by all his teachers and classmates and has more friends than I ever had. I\u2019m so proud of him. He is well-behaved both at home and at school. But lately, he has started acting strange. I think it all started around 1.5 weeks ago. He started avoiding all his responsibilities. He used to make his own bed with our help, but now he\u2019s refusing to do so. He stopped picking up his plates after dinner and started leaving his stuff around. I\u2019m afraid he might also stop doing his homework because for the last two nights, he didn\u2019t want to do it. Whenever I confront him, he straight up says, I can\u2019t, I\u2019m disabled, I have Cerebral Palsy. One time he even said, I can\u2019t, I\u2019m an R-word, and laughed. I was shocked. I told him not to use that word. I asked him if anyone told him that, and he said no. I told my wife, and we contacted his teachers, but he hasn\u2019t told them anything either and he\u2019s behaving well in school. Last night, he didn\u2019t pick up his plate after dinner again. I sat him down and told him to pick up his plate, and he screamed at me. He then again said he can\u2019t because he\u2019s disabled and useless. My wife immediately started to comfort him with \u201cno, you are not.\u201d I was frustrated with him acting out. This time, I decided to be more direct and strict. I scolded him, saying that he\u2019s only useless if he acts like he is. Then I said, \u201cNow stop using your disability as an excuse and pick up your plate.\u201d His eyes teared up, and my wife took him to his room. She thinks I\u2019m an AH for scolding him and raising my voice at him. I didn\u2019t even notice I raised my voice, but that\u2019s what she says. AITA? I should add that he has a rather mild case of Cerebral Palsy. He\u2019s not wheelchair-bound, though he needs crutches.",

About two months ago, a friend of hers got her to attend a beginner\u2019s workshop for it, and she\u2019s been hooked ever since. She\u2019s signed up for guitar and voice lessons, and writes whenever she has a moment of free time. When she finishes something, I\u2019m the first person she shows it to. I love seeing her so excited about something, and I\u2019m glad she feels comfortable enough to share her art with me. \r   She is, however, terrible at singing. Like truly awful. And to be fully honest, she\u2019s not that good at guitar either. But obviously I never wanted to tell her that. If she asked me how something sounded, I always said it was beautiful. I didn\u2019t think there was anything wrong with this kind of lie since it supported her and made her feel more confident. She disagrees.\r   To give some context as to how she found out I was lying: a few weeks ago, she asked me if it would be a good idea to start a TikTok page for her singing and songwriting. I could tell she was excited about it, but was nervous about putting her work on the internet. I told her she was crazy talented and should go for it. She lit up after I said this, and in the following days worked really hard to make videos of her original music. They didn\u2019t gain much traction, but she seemed to be having fun being a content creator, so I felt like I\u2019d made the right decision in encouraging her.\r   But yesterday, she walked into our bedroom sobbing and demanded to know why I\u2019d told her she could sing. I asked her what she meant, and she threw her phone down for me to look at. On it was one of her TikToks. It was one of those trends where you duet another musician by singing color-coded lyrics. Her video had been reposted to a \u201ccringe\u201d meme page and had blown up overnight. The comments were all horrible. Truthful, in some cases, but really mean about it. \r   She asked me again through tears why I\u2019d never told her she was bad. I told her she wasn\u2019t bad, people were just mean. \u201cIf hundreds of comments say I can\u2019t sing, then I can\u2019t sing,\u201d she snapped at me, \u201cso stop lying.\u201d \u201cOkay,\u201d I said. \u201cFine. You\u2019re definitely no Beyonce. You have a really unique sound though and I love that you share it.\u201d I thought she\u2019d feel encouraged by this, but it only made things worse. She started crying harder and insisted that the only reason she posted things in the first place was because I told her she was talented, and now she\u2019s been humiliated in front of thousands. She\u2019s deleted her TikTok account along with all her videos, and hasn\u2019t stopped crying or talked to me since. I feel like she\u2019s blowing this out of proportion; I was just trying to do a nice thing by supporting her, and it\u2019s not my fault the internet is what it is. I don\u2019t think I should\u2019ve done anything different, but since the internet put me in this position, I\u2019m curious if it will think I\u2019m in the wrong. AITA?\r",

It was so bad that he got kicked out of summer camp and went through multiple sitters all before he was 6. His mom and I worked so being a SAHP wasn't an option.  A few summers ago, we found our unicorn sitter- Mike. We have no idea Mike makes it work but he does. Caleb has been a different kid ever since Mike started working for us. He is so well-behaved, polite and social. Mike is like his best friend. We joke that Mike is Caleb's executive assistant. Earlier this year Caleb became friends with a classmate named Luke. They wanted a sleepover playdate and everything was good until we said that Mike would pick up both boys, bring them to my place, go to the pier and then back home to go to bed. Luke's mom flat out said she wasn't comfortable with a male sitter. I laughed because I thought she was joking. She wasn't. She said it was too weird for a male to babysit and wasn't cool with it. I said she didn't need to explain herself and there would be no playdates with our kids outside of school. She wasn't expecting that. I told her if she's not okay with a male caregiver then she probably wouldn't be okay with Luke spending the night at my place since I'm a single dad. I pointed out that she was the first parent to have a problem with this and Mike occasionally works for other families at the school. She was offended that I was offended. I ran into Luke's mom who said she needed a sitter for a couple of weeks as her old sitter quit and the new sitter wasn't free until mid-September. She then asked if Mike would be free. She even said she would need an overnight. I said you can't be serious. You said you didn't trust Mike and now you want him to watch your son so you can have a social life? I admit that it took guts to ask. I told her no, we will not share our nanny. You said that it was sus when a guy has a childcare job. She said she was joking and that Mike is a nice guy. I said I know he is but you can't use him. For the record, the days and times that she needed him are days where he is working for us. She would had paid him on top of what we pay but Mike would be at Luke's house or his place. My ex and I don't mind Mike double dipping on sitter fees by watching more than one kid because he can make a lot of money and Caleb gets a playdate. This was an exception where I did her a problem.",

        "selftext": "3 years ago my wife and I had our first child (the first baby in the family). My sister, always looked like she wasn't going to have kids, but did have her dog (a massive Labrador), in a big fan of the dog, but my wife understandably was a little nervous, and whilst she would tolerate the dog at family events pre-baby, when our child was born she didn't want the dog around our child.  Nothing was ever said to my sister, and she did visit us occasionally without the dog, but I think she cottoned on that there were family meet ups that she was no longer invited to as we didn't want the dog around our child.  Fast forward and now my sister has had a baby of her own. We want the cousins to grow up close but every time we offer to visit she says we have to leave our child behind because she doesn't want the toddler around her baby. Our child is too rough, and they might bring germs in from nursery. Just to be clear this baby is around the massive dog all day - so I don't think germs are really an issue!!!  It does feel like she is playing tit for tat, or am I just paranoid? I don't think we were wrong protecting our baby from her dog- so I am struggling now to see how she is taking the moral high ground! ",

        "selftext": " For context, I (19F) am from the United States and currently a second-year university student in the UK. My boyfriend (23M) is British, recently finished his master\u2019s, and is now working. We\u2019ve been dating for 10 months, and he\u2019s my first boyfriend. He\u2019s been nothing but understanding, kind, and supportive throughout our relationship. I\u2019ve met his parents and siblings twice, and both times were wonderful. His mom even told him she thinks I\u2019m \u201cthe one.\u201d In late November, he asked if I\u2019d like to spend Christmas with his family. He said everyone would love to have me there, and I thought it was sweet, but I declined. I\u2019ve been feeling homesick and wanted to spend Christmas, a holiday that means a lot to me, with my family in South Dakota. When I told him, he seemed aloof for a few days. I went to his flat later to reassure him that I\u2019d love to visit his family another time, but for me, Christmas is a family holiday. I now realize how that could\u2019ve sounded dismissive. He looked hurt and asked, \u201cDo you still love me?\u201d and \u201cAren\u2019t I your family?\u201d I reassured him that I do love him, and things seemed fine after that. About a week later, he surprised me by showing me a flight he\u2019d booked to South Dakota for Christmas. Flights to South Dakota are expensive, especially internationally, and while the gesture was touching, I thought it was impulsive and unwise. I told him it wasn\u2019t a good idea. For the first time, he got really upset, accusing me of not caring about him, not being serious about us, and thinking only of myself\u2014all of which are untrue. I love him and value our relationship deeply. Knowing he was speaking out of hurt, I asked him to take a walk to cool off. When he returned, I explained that he means everything to me, but I wasn\u2019t ready for him to meet my family. To be honest, I\u2019m nervous about how my family would react. I\u2019m white, he\u2019s Arab, and my family in rural South Dakota is not exposed to diversity. They\u2019ve made ignorant, racist comments in the past. While they\u2019d likely be polite to his face, I fear they might say something offensive or \u201cjokingly\u201d inappropriate. They also assume Arab = Muslim, even though he\u2019s Christian. This ignorance embarrasses me, and I don\u2019t want to put him in a situation where he might be hurt. I didn\u2019t tell him any of this, though. Instead, I said I felt it was too soon to \u201cbring someone home,\u201d as in my family, that\u2019s often a precursor to engagement (which is true). He asked if he wasn\u2019t \u201cgood enough,\u201d and I reassured him that he\u2019s perfect. He then mentioned that the tickets were non-refundable. I started crying, apologizing for wasting his money and saying how much I wanted him there, just not right now. He asked me to leave and said he needed space. I flew back home nearly a week ago, and since then, we\u2019ve only had brief phone conversations. He still texts me \u201cI love you\u201d and \u201cGood night,\u201d but he\u2019s clearly distant and hurt. I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s anything I can do to fix this or reassure him.

I've always been interested in smoking/BBQing, and now that I have my own place I bought an American style BBQ smoker.

The garden is quite small, about 5m x 9m and I usually have the BBQ quite close to the house. My plan for this weekend was to smoke a brisket. I went out to start the BBQ at 8am for a 10 hour smoke when my neighbour asked from over the fence how long as I was planning on BBQing for, they mentioned that they wanted to have their windows open, that they'd just put some laundry out, and also said that our other neighbour had complained about the smell (this is the first I'm hearing of this). I asked if I could start later and we agreed on 2pm. Around 2:15pm I knocked at my neighbours door to let them know I was going to start cooking, that I'd reduce the cook time to 4 hours, and that I'd moved the BBQ to the back of the garden. Their response was to tell me that they had looked up on the council website that I was not allowed to BBQ for more than 4 hours, I just said okay and I've now started my cook. (I haven't been able to find anything to backup their claim there is a Council enforced 4 hour limit BBQ limit) I feel I've done my due diligence by letting them know I was starting and checking their laundry had been taken in, AITA for using my new BBQ?",

In the past I have miscarried so we are keeping this pregnancy a secret until ~4 months and will not tell friends and family until then.  I have awful morning sickness that has let up in the past month, and as I can\u2019t tell anyone it has been hard, but Alex has really supported me in this time.  Alex\u2019s 30th birthday was Wednesday and I invited close family and friends over and got catering from his favourite restaurant. I can\u2019t cook huge volumes of food for guests or be up on my feet very long and made sure the party was short by throwing it on Sunday, so people would leave early for work the next day. The party for me was tiring and while I wanted to be there for Alex, I was glad when everyone left as I just wanted to go to bed. The morning after Alex said he has fun and I thought that was the end of it. For his actual birthday on Wednesday, I made him a cake and got him a birthday present. He seemed disappointed and when I asked why he asked me if this was it. I was confused and he said he assumed I was throwing him a big surprise birthday as I knew how much celebrating his 30th meant to him. I told him no his party was what happened on Sunday and that I have been too sick and tired to plan anything bigger. That party alone was a huge effort for me, especially coordinating what worked for everyone else, which happened to be the Sunday and worked out best for me. I got upset called him selfish and have avoided him ever since. He is upset as for my 30th he planned a big celebration and even invited my college friend from another country. I obviously appreciated his effort and that was the best birthday anyone has ever planned for me, but that\u2019s isn\u2019t possible for me to do for him with my pregnant and I told him we have different priorities now and he said that the baby wasn\u2019t even here yet. Alex has made in clear in the past he wanted to throw a big birthday for his 30th, but with my pregnancy and him seeing how it affects me day to day, I thought he would be more understanding of the effort I did make and be more aware of what is possible for his birthday.

She\u2019s very good with cleaning the kitchen and living room whenever there is a mess but her own room is another matter.

If I saw one in the elevator, I'd take another one like an adult. I (27F) live in a building that allows up to 2 dogs with no breed or weight restrictions. I have a 12 YO Chiweenie who's nothing but sweet. She rarely barks and does good with everybody, including cats. I took the elevator so she could go on her walk (sit down on the sidewalk), and this kid (20-ish) was in there first. He asked me to not come in, but I told him we have every right to use the elevators and came in. He basically squished himself into the opposite corner, started shaking, and asked me to put her behind my legs because he's scared of dogs. I told him that if he's scared of dogs, he shouldn't live in a dog-friendly apartment. He stuttered out that he wasn't asking much of me. I told him that it's entitled to ask others to accommodate his triggers. By the time this was over, he literally ran out the elevator. This one lady working at the front desk asked me if everything was okay, and I told her he was being a baby over sharing an elevator with my 7 pound dog. She went, I don't want to get involved, but the next time something like that happens, please take the next elevator. I didn't want to get on management's shit list, so I just nodded and walked away. I asked a few neighbors who have dogs, and they all said I was in the wrong and shouldn't have even gone in the elevator. I asked my friends and family, and everybody thought I was being rude. My aunt replied, It costs nothing to be kind to people despite what your generation seems to think. AITA? I'm scared of spiders but I don't make it everybody else's problem.",

We aren't super big but we are profitable and make a b2b SaaS web app. It is a small company and everyone knows each other really well. I was recently having diner with my sister whose daughter graduated in CS 2 years ago and was a junior programmer. She worked for iRobot but got laid off recently. We were talking about tech related topics while we were having diner and she seemed like someone passionate about the industry so I mentioned that there were openings at my workplace. She then inquired about job referrals. Since we never really worked together, I told her I could do so but I\u00b4'd like to ask her a question to gauge her knowledge and would only refer her if she passed. I asked her a problem I knew of the top of my head on dynamic programming to use CS concepts to maximize the amount of coins by opening boxes, which is quite similar to a popular problem on bursting balloons (on leetcode). She failed to produce an efficient answer within 45 minutes and only finally got it after an hour and a half after a hint so I said I could not refer her but she was free to apply on her own. My sister is now upset at me and called me an asshole and said I should still try to help her and that it was unfair to test her on the spot. The thing is I don\u00b4't want to take any risks as if I did refer her, she would probably get hired as our interviews are very easy and almost all refereed candidates get hired. But then if she performed badly after being refereed it would reflect really badly on me. I know the question I asked is not related to the job but I still think it is a good way to test ones intelligence.",

        "selftext": "My husband (34m) and I (27f) recently adopted a kitten (0.438m) together. I want to get the kitten neutered as soon as possible: he is an indoor cat; I don't want to deal with spraying and other pubescent feline behaviour. My husband is against neutering him, saying he dislikes the idea of altering his physiology. This is not a pedigree cat; my husband has no plans of getting him to sire kittens. I don't believe he understands what keeping him intact is going to entail. I feel like he sees neutering as a threat to his masculinity. I am thinking of neutering the kitten without my husband's consent but feel like that'd be wrong. That's the TL;DR.  We have agreed before that it's best if he stays an indoor cat. We're living in a house right now but we are renting and ultimately don't have a strong anchor anywhere; we are likely to move in the next two years. Our cat may be moved around quite a lot in his lifetime so it's safest and most comfortable for him if he doesn't get used to roaming, which intact males are driven to do. My husband understood and seemed to agree with me before, when we discussed this ahead of getting the cat.   Now that it's the best time to neuter, my husband has changed his mind 180 and would like to allow our cat to get out. All of the sudden, Nextdoor posts about run-over cats seem like nothing next to a quick, safe, proven-to-help surgical procedure.  I think he might see my insistence on neutering our cat as an insult to his own masculinity: in one conversation, he got agitated and said I would neuter *him* if I had the chance.  Dear reader, while I am a fan of vasectomy as an idea, my husband has never been under pressure to get one or gotten one, and that is not the subject of the present debate.  So my dilemma is as follows: he's got a work trip coming up in a few days, and I might just take the cat to the vet for a quick snippy snap while he's away. But what broke my heart is that he said none of his male friends who have neutered male cats love their cats. I did see one of those friends interact with his cat (one that has *implants*); it was not great.  For added context, we don't have kids; have been together for 8 years; we have lived with a cat before, my husband's female intact cat. I thought he hated dealing with her in heat, seeing her suffer, as much as I did; he talked about getting her neutered for the entire three years she lived with us, but life always got in the way. Perhaps he hated the idea of neutering cats all along? (We moved out of the country and that (now older) cat is keeping my husband's grandmother company now. She's fine as far as I can tell.) However, that was entirely his call to make; this one is our shared responsibility, which is why I'm hesitant to make it on my own.  Edit to change 'knowledge' in paragraph #1 to 'consent': I told my husband I was considering / posting this as the post was going live.  UPD: we talked about this again. He has one (1) male friend with a neutered male cat, referred to above, and zero (0) friends with intact male cats. He was just being an idiot relying on the way things used to be in his village when he was a kid and it doesn't help that there's someone else's apparently intact male cat roaming the neighbourhood. He's chronically online but not in the same way as I am, i.e. I've known cats are supposed to stay indoors + be neutered FOR AGES and he watches cats on Reels. We're getting the cat neutered; not getting a divorce, sorry to disappoint \u2014 he's a ding dong but he's my ding dong. Thank you all for the comments, I've read some that helped me understand his point of view and get through to him in ways I hadn't tried before!  UPD 2 after reading some more comments: 1. A huge shout out to all the vets here, and all the volunteers working with pets. Thank you for your work, and for your time spent dealing with asshats. 2. My dudes some of y'all have not been in long-term relationships and it shows. It would've been a completely different story if it happened when we first got together, but it *didn't*, which is the reason I found it as weird as you did. We've been married for 3 years. I definitely knew what I was doing. ",

        "selftext": " I (38M) and my wife Eve (33F) have been together for 4 years, married for 2. Eight months ago, our twins were born, and Eve decided to stay home with them (her decision, not mine). For some context, I grew up in a wealthy family, while Eve did not. Her mother, a single mom, was loving but had to work a lot, which influenced Eve\u2019s decision to stay home with our children. Now, I grew up with incredibly loving parents until I was 12. Everything changed when my dad was in a car accident that drastically altered him. He became angry, constantly yelled, and even started cheating on my mom. When I asked my mom why she didn\u2019t leave him, she explained that she couldn\u2019t afford to give us (three kids) the same lifestyle\u2014gated community, private schools, etc. So, she stayed with him until he passed away a few years later. Because of this, when my wife and I got married, I opened a separate account for her and one for our children. My intention was that, if for any reason I changed or became difficult to live with like my dad, Eve wouldn\u2019t feel trapped or pressured to stay. Every month, I deposit a percentage of my income into these accounts. Both accounts are now approaching six figures, with the kids\u2019 account having a bit more. Here\u2019s where things get complicated. A few weeks ago, we went on vacation and left my sister house-sitting. For some reason, she went through my office and found the paperwork for these accounts. I hadn\u2019t told my wife about them yet because she\u2019s proud and doesn\u2019t like receiving big financial gifts, so I was trying to figure out how to bring it up without upsetting her. Well, my sister told my mom, and they both confronted me. My mom was angry because I didn\u2019t give her money for an upcoming surgery (she doesn\u2019t actually need the money, as she inherited from my dad and we already help her financially). I explained that I created the accounts to prevent my wife from going through what my mom did, but both my mom and younger sister seemed to forget that part. The only person who\u2019s on my side is my older sister. Now, my wife is upset and says she doesn\u2019t want the money, that I should give it all to our kids or my mom.

On the last day for registration, he gave me the documents, but the college website wouldn't accept the login credentials. I tried calling him, but he didn't answer. When I got home, he confessed he hadn't been accepted and had lied to me out of fear. I felt deeply disappointed. I had been telling everyone about his acceptance and working overtime to buy him a car as a gift. In anger, I told him he was a disappointment, which I regret. The next day, I wanted to apologize and discuss his future options, but he was out with friends. I used our shared computer and found a conversation where he and his friends insulted me and called his friends his real family. It seemed like he left the computer on for me to see. When he got home, I yelled at him and told him he had until the end of the year to get a job and move out. He cried, saying I was overreacting, but I stood firm. Now, his grandparents are urging me to change my mind, but I feel justified. I've always tried to be a good father, and this betrayal hurts deeply. So, am I the asshole?",

        "selftext": "I (27F) have a strange living situation. I live with a family (Chris, 65M, Danielle, 59F, and their daughter) and do household chores in exchange for rent. I've lived here for 19 months; it's mostly smooth sailing. I work full-time and am applying to law school. Danielle has some issues with boundaries (she doesn't understand why she can\u2019t enter my room w/o permission, for example), and I know it's both due to age differences and the fact that they allow me to live in their house for free. I have to be very careful when enforcing boundaries. Yesterday, I made dinner for everyone after a full day of chores. Around 10 pm, as I was finishing the dishes, Danielle told me I needed to steam clean the carpet in the living room because the cats had peed all over it. I did, and as I was putting the steam cleaner away, Danielle entered and said she wanted me to do another room. Because it was 10:30 at this point and I still wanted to work on an application before bed, I politely but firmly said, I'm not going to do that. I probably should have said, I'll do it tomorrow, but I was exhausted, so I just said no. I put the machine away, submitted my application, and went to bed. Tonight, as I was finishing up my meal prep for the week, Danielle cornered me in the kitchen. I don't want to fight about this, she said, But I wanted to mention something. Last night when you told me you weren't going to clean the other room, I found it rude. You should be careful when you say things like that at work so that you don't get fired. I was floored. I snapped, Danielle, you haven't had a job since before I was born. You don't get to give me advice about how to act in the workplace. Danielle rolled her eyes and huffed, See, I didn't want to fight about this, and walked out of the room. I called after her, Then maybe don't bring it up?!? Danielle hasn't spoken to me since, and I don't know what's coming. For context, Danielle has only had one job in her whole life, from age 22 to age 25. After that, she quit to raise kids. I grew up very poor. I have been working since I was 14 and supporting myself since I turned 18. They offered to start our arrangement in 2023 because they needed help around the house and I was struggling financially. As for Danielle's work advice, I currently work as a Regional Manager at a small firm. Not only is her advice outdated, but I can't take it. I'm a people manager; a lot of my day-to-day job involves being polite but unyielding. I think she was frustrated by my setting a boundary and that's why she brought it up. I know part of my frustration is that I feel powerless to protest most of the time. I will be moving out in August of this year when I go to law school (hopefully!), and my goal is just to make it until then. I'm also really frustrated that Danielle felt like she could say whatever she wanted and then walk away as if I had no right to feel anything. AITA for what I said? UPDATE: First, as an aside, a lot of the comments here missed the point. Danielle was not angry with me for refusing to do an additional chore at 10:30pm; that was not the issue. Even by the most generous of understandings, demanding additional overtime work at the end of a 14-hour shift is unreasonable, and she knew that. During our follow-up discussion, she added a detail I had totally forgotten about \u2013 the second room in question has a large potted Fiddle-Leaf Fig tree in it, and in order to steam clean the additional room, the tree needs to be moved. Neither she or I were able to move it after multiple attempts, so at that point I said, \u201cUntil Chris and I can figure out a way to move this, the steam cleaning will have to wait. I know you want it done tonight, but I will not be doing that.\u201d Very important context that I missed adding when I was angry. The issue in question was the exchange the next day. As to how I responded the second day when she came to confront me on my wording, for that, I understand now that I was absolutely the asshole. As one of my close friends put it to me, \u201cThose are inside thoughts.\u201d My context about her work history was also unnecessary and irrelevant. Last night, I approached Danielle and opened the conversation with a profuse apology. No qualifiers, no protests, just that I was rude during our kitchen conversation and I needed to apologize. She in turn immediately apologized for her incredibly poor introduction to the follow-up conversation and for cornering me in the kitchen while I was otherwise occupied instead of meeting with me at a more neutral time. Chris then joined us and we had an extensive conversation. During the conversation, I asked them to define how they view our arrangement. They were immediately very clear that they don\u2019t see me as a tenant, employee, or servant. I pointed out that if that is how they want to view things, then I need to be free to say no extra requests. They were receptive to this. I also pointed out that in our state, I could either be considered a tenant or a live-in domestic worker, but due to the length of time I\u2019ve resided here and the conditions in place, I am definitely not considered just a guest. They did get offended that I see our relationship as fundamentally a transaction, which I found kind of funny, because while they have the freedom to frame it in their minds as \u201cwe\u2019re helping this person out and she\u2019s helping us out,\u201d it\u2019s wise for me to see it differently. I do have obligations to them and my life has substantially larger implications should this not work out. In the end, they agreed that because they aren\u2019t landlords and I am not their employee (in their minds), I should be receiving more freedom than I have been given. Chris and Danielle have chronic illnesses that make most of the work I do very difficult for them, including a lot of the care I provide for their adult daughter who lives with us. We then outlined (again) exactly what my responsibilities are and what they\u2019re not. Finally, to my surprise, they apologized for previous invasions of privacy and agreed that we would put a lock on my room door. It is an interior lock only so I can\u2019t lock it while I\u2019m gone, but I am fine with the progress. I was never threatened with eviction or anything like that; people can be emotionally mature enough to talk through issues instead of immediately pulling a metaphorical trigger, which is what happened here. After the conversation, I typed out a long email detailing the terms of my living here as it currently stands and had them send a confirmation in reply. While it is not officially a lease, it is something in writing outlining responsibilities that was agreed to by all parties. We agreed that my monthly hours would be reduced to 80 instead of the roughly 100 I have been doing. If the value of that is calculated according to the federal minimum wage, that\u2019s a value of $580 every four weeks, which is more than most rooms-for-rent are in our area. Of course, the labor I do is somewhat skilled and has a market value of at least double, but I used the federal minimum wage for the sake of argument. I also established that the latest I would be available for housework is 9:30pm, barring some form of emergency, and if a task absolutely requires going past that time, I will be taking that time back on a different day. I know that I will laugh at this in Contracts class in the future, but for now, I\u2019m fine with what it is. Like I said in a comment, it\u2019s not ideal but it works. I\u2019m not in a position where I desperately need this anymore, but I\u2019m going to stay here until August because being able to funnel what otherwise would be paid in rent into savings is doing wonders to set me up for the future. To everyone that commented something along the lines of \u201cYou have to do everything she says\u201d or \u201cYou\u2019re the help\u201d or \u201cYou\u2019re entitled,\u201d I encourage you to think about that perspective more. Employees, household help, and any people in a subordinate position are still very much an individual and deserving of basic respect to their space, their time, and their person. No laws, no matter how extensive, take those basic rights away. Also, if you said it was my \u201cfault\u201d for being in the situation in the first place, kick rocks. We are all working through our own situations where we pick the best option available even if it isn\u2019t perfect. That\u2019s not weakness or stupidity, that\u2019s life.",

Kate is pregnant with our second child, we recently found out we are having a baby girl. While we were discussing different baby names I suggested Charlotte (fake name).  Charlotte was my childhood best friend who unfortunately passed away when we were 18 in a car crash. The two of us were friends for our whole lives, once she left my life I told myself I would name one of my children after her. It just so happened that we are having a daughter next.  The issue is my mother was convinced me and Charlotte would get married. Neither me nor her liked each other in that way. My mother consequently hates Kate. She has never been afraid of telling Kate she will never be Charlotte. Whenever things like that come up we always leave, as neither of us want to listen to her ramble. I\u2019ve always told my mother that I love Kate, and she needs to drop her resentment towards her. It has gotten to the point where I have dropped my mother from my family and life. I couldn\u2019t take her degrading my wife anymore.After Kate heard my suggestion she left the house. She wouldn\u2019t respond when I asked her what was wrong, and hasn\u2019t respond to my messages. It\u2019s been a few days now, and I\u2019ve just been told she is with her parents and needs to be left alone for a few days. I understand that it is very possible that she probably has bad experiences with the name and just doesn\u2019t want to name our baby after her. Edit: I know my wife made a post on here as well, currently trying to keep up with all the comments.  Edit 2: I\u2019ve been reading a lot of the comments so I wanted to add a little. Yes my mother refuses to acknowledge our son as a real grandchild. Hell, she refused to believe the kid was mine. No, I don\u2019t think naming our daughter Charlotte will make my mother love her more. I think the same thing will happen with her. Yes my wife also has an argument before she left and didn\u2019t just walk out. ",

Last night he told me he had a very important work meeting and wasn't going to be able to pick his daughter up from her playdate at her friends house today. I volunteered to pick her up and take her back to my place ( that she has been to many times ) and watch her until he got back because I work at home and it wouldn't be a problem.

When I picked up his daughter she asked why her booster seat wasn't there and I told her she was going to ride without it today and she'd be fine. She was very quiet the entire drive which seemed odd to me because she is usually a very talkative kid.

He confronted me about this and I told him I lost tack of time and so I just picked her up without it.  He was furious with me! He said it was so irresponsible of me to not have her booster seat for her and that I put her in danger.  I tried to calm him down and said how sorry I was but he didn't want to hear it. He took his daughter home and hasn't responded to my calls or texts since.  I also received a call from his ex wife where she expressed how upset she was at me for putting her daughter in danger.

They were nice at first but I couldn\u2019t stand the sight of them at the end of the night. Dinner conversation was normal as they asked about me and my family. Then the table divided into smaller conversation groups and I overheard his older brothers talking to his sister about investing. I\u2019m not an expert so I\u2019ll give you the gist of what I heard. She\u2019s been out of school for a couple of years and have saved up about $75,000 and wants to start investing. They said property is the best and that section 8 is the way to go. They said that the rent is always paid on time and the people won\u2019t mess up the property because they\u2019re afraid of getting kicked out of the program. They said the best part is that they\u2019ll still own the properties and the value will always go up. They said they\u2019re developing a small neighborhood with about 10 houses specifically for section 8. All of those houses under 2000 sqft and have 4 bedrooms as section 8 pays higher rates for more bedrooms and smaller houses are cheaper to maintain. They said that it\u2019ll cost them about $100/sqft to build these houses and the rent will be about $4000 per month. They said that she could buy in on her first rental house next year when they start another development. They\u2019re in the process of closing on a piece of land that will accommodate about 20 houses. I cringed then couldn\u2019t keep quiet anymore. I told them that instead of renting out and keeping those houses off the market, they should sell them to those people. They looked at me quietly and I knew they never considered helping people out by selling the houses they were building. His dad told me I was out of line and I answered that his family was out of line for preying on people in need while feeding off of the taxes people pay. I said that most people can\u2019t afford to buy a single house yet his sons are building 10-20 at a time which makes them leeches.  We argued for a bit then we left. This morning my boyfriend told me I need to apologize to his family but I refused to. We just met after my last class and told me we\u2019re no longer invited to any of his family function including the Christmas trip back to their old country. Since we're still in school, his family was going to pay for us so he really wants me to apologize and smooth things over. I know I\u2019m right but maybe I shouldn\u2019t have been so harsh on the first meeting. What do you think?  ",

        "selftext": "throwaway lol. my boyfriend (24m) and i (21f) have been officially together for around 5 months. he\u2019s had a full beard the entire time i\u2019ve known him, and i guess he\u2019s mostly kept a beard since he started growing facial hair around 15, so the only pictures i\u2019ve seen of him without one are from when he was in middle school or younger.  yesterday when he was on lunch at work he facetimed me and surprised me that he had gone fully shaved. he didn\u2019t tell me he was planning it so it kind of shocked me. when i answered the phone my first thought was that it was actually his hs aged brother that he lives with (that looks a lot like him), and when i realized it was him i kind of gasped and then couldn\u2019t help myself from laughing for a minute.  obviously he seemed kind of upset but i tried to make sure and tell him that i still like how he looks, i was just very surprised because he looks decently different and much much younger without facial hair and i wasn\u2019t expecting to answer the call to that.  he still seemed upset and quickly hung up afterwards, said something like \u201cthis is why i never fully shave\u201d. i was supposed to see him today but he\u2019s been pretty dry with few responses since then. AITA for my reaction?  EDIT: yes, i would definitely be upset if he initially laughed at me for cutting/dyeing my hair, but i\u2019d also expect it from at least a person or two if i fully shaved my head out of nowhere. either way, i know it probably hurt him more than i thought and i already apologized to him for laughing at first over text. planning to apologize in person too the next time i see him, and don\u2019t worry i will be showering him with compliments because i do think he still looks great!  EDIT 2: jesus christ, i shouldn\u2019t have said a minute because it wasn\u2019t literally a full minute. also maybe i didn\u2019t phrase it right but i definitely wasn\u2019t laughing at his face, just the sudden change and the fact that i somehow thought it was his younger brother ",

        "selftext": "I (28F) have had my guinea pig, Twix, for 3 years now. I live alone, and my boyfriend of 6 months (29M) stays over at my house a lot. Twix is \u201cfree-range.\u201d Not completely, because that would be dangerous, but he\u2019s able to move freely between a small screened in porch area and a bedroom. I don\u2019t have any other animals, but I don\u2019t want to accidentally hurt him or let him hurt himself.  He has toys and water throughout the space, it\u2019s totally his, and I love being able to provide him with more freedom than a traditional cage. Bf has always found this gross but never made it a big deal. But it must have been boiling inside him, because when I was in the room playing with Twix the other day while bf was over, bf came into the room as well and stepped in some poop (which is bound to happen every once in a while with a free range guinea pig). Bf WENT OFF about how gross it is and how having this space for Twix was inconsiderate to him and if I loved him I would put Twix in a regular size cage and repurpose the extra room in my house for his use/more space for us to be together. My house is 2 bedrooms and like I said, I live alone, it\u2019s not like bf officially moved in. I love Twix and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to let someone change the way I\u2019ve always treated him. I feel like if Twix was a dog or cat it wouldn\u2019t be a problem because that\u2019s seen as more normal. My mother agrees I\u2019m not being fair to bf by \u201cputting an animal above a person.\u201d AITA? Edits for clarification: The areas Twix has free access to are covered in rubber and PVC flooring. Basically how you would set up a playpen, just larger scale.I am looking for a buddy for him \ud83d\udc96 but right now he's solo for a bit.Twix does poop on random areas of the floor, but has some consistent areas and I do clean up after him. I just can't clean up after him 24/7 and guinea pigs poop a lot.Twix is **not completely free-range around the entire house**, just in 2 rooms.",

Jess (obviously not her fault) is looking for attention that she's not getting from her parents. Both my fiance and I have politely told her that we are there to play with our daughter and make sure she's safe in the pool as she's only just learning to swim. We've had to do this because the Jess is incessantly talking to us to the point that we literally couldn't get a word in edgewise to encourage our own child.  At least 3 other families with children have decided to get out of the pool because Jess is in their personal space and simply won't leave them alone as well as a few older couples obviously there just trying to relax.  In the 3 days we have been here so far, we have not seen her parents spend any time in the pool with her and they seem obvious to the fact that she is getting in other people's way. I HAVE seen the dad in the pool in the deep end whilst Jess was harassing other people in the shallow end.  Also we have heard her ask multiple times for the parents to join her in the pool only to be flatly refused even though the dad would happily swim on his own. So yeah, WIBTA if I, politely as possible, told them that if they're going to come on holiday as a family then they should spend some time in the pool as a family? ",

        "selftext": "Sorry in advance everyone, English is not my first language but I am a content writer so you guys should be able to understand everything. Now, I am (25f) an Indian, and we have a ritual here. The wedding reception is held one day after wedding and in-laws give their DILs the saree they are supposed to wear for that particular function. I was well aware of that and I have seen this happening since my childhood. Now a little background for you all. My wedding is in 10 days and the date was finalised back in February. I do a job and I have invested my weekoffs shopping and planning most of the wedding.  I bought my wedding saree in March and that same day I liked another beautiful Benarasi Saree that I bought for wearing at the reception. Now, I discussed the thing with my fiance and asked him if his parents will be okay if I buy the saree and he told me I should go ahead and buy it and his parents would be more than happy to reimburse me because they are supposed to buy that for me anyway. He gave me the money I spent for that saree and I gave the blouse piece to my tailor so she could make a beautiful blouse for me. It was all sorted by May. Fast forward to today, my future FIL sent me a courier which contained the blouse piece of ANOTHER BENARASI SAREE and I was shocked to discover that they were not aware that I already purchased the saree that I am gonna wear for reception. I bought my finance\u2019s suit everything in a contrasting colour and bought my jewelleries accordingly. But NOW 10 days before I got to know my finance never told my future MIL or FIL that I already bought it in MARCH!  So, I don\u2019t want to disappoint them by not wearing the saree they have chosen for me. (I haven\u2019t seen it yet, but I am sure it would be nice). But at the same time, I really had a vision with the Saree I originally chose to wear for this function and I am very upset right now that it will not be fulfilled.  WIBTAH if I wear the one I originally planned to wear for this function instead of the one my future in laws bought for me? Update: Just got off a call with my fianc\u00e9 and he said it would be very \u201ccomplicated\u201d to talk to his parents now. I better wear the saree my future ILs bought for me and to make it up to me, he will purchase a new set of suit that will go appropriately with the saree. He will also go shopping with me again and bring the saree with him so I can find an appropriate blouse to go with it. P.S I have not seen the saree yet, he said he will send a picture tomorrow. Also, I am heartbroken and in tears as I write this because I believe all these could have been resolved with some better communication.  Update 2: Today my fianc\u00e9 denied that he ever had anything to do with it and told me \u201cwho asked you to go ahead and buy it?\u201d And also told me I should wear the saree his parents have chosen for me (I still haven\u2019t seen it). So, there you all go people I am marrying an asshole I guess. Lot of money has been invested and cannot call it off now, but I am very happy for the support you all gave me. Best of luck to me, will come back with another update after the reception. ",

But sometimes with a wife and two boys and job that requires you to travel isn\u2019t ideal .  But I\u2019m not interested in other work because like I said it\u2019s what I love and I\u2019m lucky and blessed financially.  Sometimes I bring my wife and children on the trips but this time I decided not to and my wife is getting suspicious and thinks I\u2019m being sneaky.  Honestly I don\u2019t blame her I can understand where she\u2019s coming from. Lovers get jealous/see red flags and ask questions I understand that I\u2019ve had my moments of jealously too but the truth is I don\u2019t want to bring her and the kids because it stops being a work trip and a becomes a vacation where I also got to work WHILE ALSO catering to her and the boys in her mind it\u2019s like in her mind I\u2019m not working  Instead of a three day trip where I go to work and come back home  it now becomes a week plus long vacation where we have to do all the tourist things I\u2019ve done a million times for the last several years. A vacation with two boys isn\u2019t the most peaceful vacation in the world either. But she thinks I\u2019m being sneaky .  But the truth is I rather go do what I have to do , watch some tv in the hotel room without the boys screaming , smoke some weed and come back to my family in a couple days. I do enjoy the small periods alone but It\u2019s not like I have some secret family I\u2019m traveling to see nor am I planning trips to purposely get away but when it happens I do enjoy it by myself.  This has caused suspicion and a riff in my household.  Should I just tell her to come ? But wouldn\u2019t that be more suspicious? Like she caught me ? Does that mean I can\u2019t take any trips without them anymore I have to bring them everytime? No more solo work trips ? I\u2019ve gone on this trips long before even meeting my wife What should I do? We have a pretty strong relationship and I would hate for something so small to cause us problems .

I come from a more affluent background, and my parents have always been generous with me. I\u2019ve got a great job and a good savings. Seeing her work so hard and stress about her finances, I wanted to help. So, a few weeks ago, I offered to pay for her tuition when she transfers to the university. I thought it was a good idea. I love her and I want to support her dreams. But when I made the offer, she got really upset. She accused me of thinking she was some sort of charity case and said that my offer made her feel inadequate and embarrassed about her financial situation. She told me that she didn't want to feel indebted to anyone and that she wanted to achieve her goals on her own. I tried to explain that I was just trying to help and that I didn't see her as a charity case at all. I just wanted to ease her burden and support her in any way I could. A few days ago, we got into a big fight. She was venting about her college dues, and I snapped and told her that if she wouldn't let me help by paying for it, then she shouldn't keep bringing it up around me.
