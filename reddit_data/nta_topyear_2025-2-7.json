She remarried when he was 14. I did when he was 16.  I had an RESP set up for him. That's a education fund in Canada. As long as he went for post secondary education he could use the money for anything.  I always told him that I was okay with him not going to university. That way I could use the money I had saved up for him to go to Belgium and buy some beer from monks that only allow you to buy one case. He knew I was joking and he always played along. He wouldn't let me get his goat.  When he got accepted to McGill it was the proudest moment of my life. I took him out for a beer to celebrate his achievement and mourn the loss of my trip to Europe.  My son was struck and killed by a drunk driver in March. I'm dealing with it. My ex is dealing with it. My wife has been nothing but my rock in this. She is holding me up.  I was dealing with the funeral arrangements and everything when my ex came to talk to me about his money. She knew he had a scholarship and was just going to use the money for living expenses and an emergency fund. She asked me what I was going to do with it.  I said I was going to do what I always said I would. I was going to Europe to drink beer. She asked if she could have it for her step son. I thought about it and said no. Her husband is a decent enough person but he made it clear that he wasn't responsible for any expenses for my son. Beyond food and shelter and stuff obviously. Like I said he is decent.  I said I was not going to do that. I was going to go drink beer in my son's honour.  She says I'm wasting thousands of dollars. And I guess I am. I have to give back the government portion of the fund. But I don't care.  My ex thinks I'm being stupid and irresponsible wasting my son's money like this.  I don't care.  My son would laugh his ass off if he knew I actually did it.",

The last six months of her life were hell.  My sister Sarah didn't do jack shit for us of us during that time. My wife never liked her. I do not like her. She is a selfish cow. At my wife\u2019s wake, she started asking about my wife\u2019s clothes, and I brushed her off. She wanted to pick out a few pieces to \u201cremember my wife by,\u201d and I ignored her.  It's been six months, and I've attended my mom\u2019s birthday, but I\u2019m still not in the mood to deal with people. Then Sarah comes, asking about my wife\u2019s clothes.  I told her my wife wanted me to donate them to this women's shelter, and she often helped. It will help women in need with their own court cases, court appointments, and job interviews.  My sister Sarah said my wife was even selfish in death. I asked her what the fuck did she mean? And she started going off on how my wife always thought she was better than her, and it's not far that the clothes are going to charity and not to family.  I told my sister I would rather see my wife\u2019s clothes lit on fire than on her back. My sister started crying, and my mom came over to see what was wrong. My mom told me to be easy on my sister because she was talking about my wife\u2019s death hard.  The fucking insanity of that coming out of my mom\u2019s mount made me grab my gift and leave. My mom acts like I had to ruin her birthday by being melodramatic, but I cannot believe their emotional blackmail towards me over fucking clothes that they have no right to. ",

His 2 daughters thought the same thing, but he's broke as a joke and I've got a trust fund, so actually no.    He's broke because his late wife got cancer. 3 times. He ran up 6 credit cards, 2^(nd) mortgage on the house, cashed out his retirement, everything and anything to get her the treatment she needed and then to get treatment enough to see both daughters married.    His daughters live 6hrs drive away.    We drove to them for Xmas last year and the year before. They ignored me, dragged Tim away when he tried to include me and prevented their husbands from making even small talk with me by talking over me.    Year 1 Tim chastised them, they apologized (to him, not me) They blamed the pain of seeing their Dad with a woman who wasn't their Mum.  Year 2, they did it again.    This year I told Tim not again.  He could go, I would never ask him not to see his daughters for Xmas but I'll stay here.    Tim didn't love the idea because me going with him means we can share the responsibility of driving when his back starts to bother him. (He hates to fly)  His 2010 deathtrap is starting to go anyway, so I leased him a comfy luxury ride (my brother has a dealership)    He called the girls, super excited that he'd be able to see them more often without having to worry about his back,, who then blew up and accused him of spending their Mothers money on a \u201cbull**** house and car to impress some bimbo bartender and didn't offer them a dime for their weddings\u201d    In the ensuing argument it came out that they assumed there had been a life insurance policy, nor did they have any idea about the credit card debt or the 2^(nd) mortgage that the house was underwater on or that Tim was looking at foreclosure and bankruptcy until he moved in with me.    They did not realize it was my house, that he pays no bills save the water bill (man takes excessive showers) and shared groceries.    Now the girls want my number. They are sorry I \u201cfelt lonely\u201d at Xmas. They want to come visit and stay with us next year! Conveniently in summer, I live near a beach.    I've told Tim absolutely not about giving out my number. I'm happy to be polite if they come to visit Tim but, we're not going to be friends. If they had talked to me for even 2 seconds they'd have understood. I am not shy about admitting the only thing I have ever contributed to my blessed financial state is \u201cnot developing a crippling coke addiction\u201d like my cousin Danny did.   Tim thinks I'm being too unforgiving. They would have warmed up to me eventually but knowing how generous I am being with their Father has made them warm up quicker.    I maintain I don't care about now or later, they had their chance to not be catty brats over incorrect assumptions that I was taking advantage of him.",

        "selftext": "I'm (18m) graduating high school at the end of this month. My dad dropped the bomb on me two nights ago that his stepdaughter (14f) has an award ceremony for some competition she entered and won in another state on that same day and that she really wants him to be there. He told me he couldn't possibly make it to both and since his wife and their children together will be going, he needs to be there too. He told me he would make it up to me and we could celebrate another time. I still live with him (not for much longer). My mom died when I was 7 and my dad got married again when I was 11 or 12. It's been a few years anyway. His stepdaughter never knew her bio dad, so my dad has accepted her as his own. And he has prioritized her a lot in the last 5/6 years. It doesn't always show in the most obvious ways but it can be felt. Father/son time was put on an indefinite hiatus and instead dad told me we needed to include her in our time together but he also spent time with just her for father/daughter time. I brought it up to my dad and he told me I wasn't exactly making an effort to be closer to her so he wanted us all to bond and didn't want me to just focus on my relationship with him. He has attended her dance things instead of my basketball games if they're on at the same time. It doesn't matter if mine was known about first, he will still skip my stuff to go to hers. He will take us on family days and whenever he and his wife say kids can choose he picks her choices over mine. He claims it's because they will be the most fun for everyone but really, he even says it afterward, anything his little princess wants. Our refrigerator and our shower broke at the same time. His stepdaughter's birthday was coming up so he took money from my birthday fund to pay for that stuff and so his stepdaughter would definitely get what she wanted (this barbie house thing and a whole fashion set and they were I think dad said $250). He didn't get all the money back by the time my birthday came around so instead he bought me a $30 gift card for Steam when he had promised me a new monitor and keyboard for my computer (that was a gift from my grandparents). When my dad told me he wouldn't be at my graduation to go and support her, I told him there is no making up for that and he can forget about being included in my life going forward. He told me he would make it up to me and I told him I will always come second to his little princess and I'm not going to be okay with that. I told him he's discarded me for the last time. Dad begged me to be reasonable but I walked away. Then I invited both sets of grandparents who agreed to come. His wife told me I could have come with them and I don't need to attend the ceremony but could support my sister. I said her daughter's not my sister and I do not want to support their family anymore and I will be out of their hair soon. She called me selfish and told me I can't deny her daughter a dad.  AITA?",

I have over 400 bottles at this point, I take great pride in my collection, and I use it. I\u2019m also happy to give people decants (samples) of most of my bottles, let them sample a spray or two, give some bottles as gifts, etc.  What I have a HUGE fucking issue with is my 17 year old niece coming into my home under the guise of walking my dog, decanting bottles on her own and SELLING THE SAMPLES to her little friends. She thinks that because I have so many bottles, I wouldn\u2019t notice some missing or getting massive dents in them. Well little miss entrepreneur failed to realize that her \u201cprivate\u201d Instagram wasn\u2019t \u201cfriends only\u201d or whatever and I saw each and every fucking story with each price and sample she had. I tallied that shit up and got a pretty good estimate based on cost per ounce. Thankfully she mostly picked the \u201cTiktok famous\u201d perfumes like Bianco Latte and Escapade Gourmand and didn\u2019t go for the most rare, niche perfumes. She did snatch an entire 2.5 oz bottle of Baccarat Rouge, though, which runs $300+ at most retailers, as well as full bottles of perfumes you can get at Sephora. Like Marc Jacobs Daisy, Burberry Her Elixir, Flowerbomb, etc.  Petty or not, I printed out the entire list of what she\u2019d taken, price estimate, and handed it off to my sister (her mom). I said that I expect to be paid back, in full. And of course her fucking sneaky little ass is never allowed in my home again. My sister got super pissy with me going on about how my niece is just a kid, kids make mistakes, etc. I said yes, kids make mistakes, and this is a GREAT way for my niece to learn from hers. Their argument is that now the money she was going to use for a car has to go towards paying me back. I don\u2019t care. She is lucky that I have no interest in involving the police, small claims, or any of that. But AITA, because she IS a teenager?",

        "selftext": "Throwaway.  So my husband comes from a 'traditional' family. Mum's a SAHM, father was sole provider. I come from the opposite - my mother pretty much forbade from ever being financially dependent on a man and drilled that into me early on.  My husband worked hard to unlearn the values he saw replicated at home. He (often more than) pulled his weight at home, was an engaged and present father and a genuine partner. The one thing that grinds my gears is how much weight he puts on the opinions of his family. I get that we all want our parents to be proud of us, but this is too much. My ILs are staying with us for 2 weeks. Our usual MO is, I prep breakfast, we all eat lunch at work/school, and my husband makes dinner. We have a cleaner, but she's on holiday so in the meantime we're DIYing the cleaning where it's down to everyone to keep their space clean and common spaces we all clean. This is how we've always done it, and it works.  My ILs hate that I'm 'one of those modern women'. They hate that I work, they hate that I don't find my purpose in being a wife and mother and they hate that my husband pulls his weight at home. We spoke pretty frankly early on, where I established my boundaries and told them I won't be chastised about how I live my life in my home. When I am a guest in their home, I accommodate their ways and play the DIL they wish I was. They have for the most part respected this.  I got home yesterday after work tired and starving. I typically get home 1815/30 and we eat at 1900. I said quick hellos and ran up for a pre-dinner shower. When I came down, I went to the kitchen to help set up for dinner and found nothing ready. I asked my husband about it but he wouldn't look at me and his mother answered that he hadn't cooked anything. She told me I needed to do my duty as a wife and cook for my family. My coward of a husband still wasn't looking at me. I just walked away and ordered takeaway. I dished up for me and my kids and we sat at the table to eat. My husband and his parents served themselves and joined us.  My MIL was still going on about what was wrong with me and why I was a failure. I asked my husband if he had anything to say. He said his mother had a point and it wouldn't hurt if I acted 'more like a proper woman' and 'took better care of my home and children'. He said tradition was tradition for a reason and it was kind of insulting that I thought I was too good for how he was raised.  This is where I might be the asshole. I told him tradition won't allow a man on 35k to support a family of 5 and he was too broke to be so sexist. He looked hurt and I saw tears welling in his eyes. He excused himself from the table. I regret saying this in front of our children, but him saying that to me after I'm busting my ass to clean up his mess on top of having to deal with his parents was too much for me. AITA.  ",

        "selftext": "My husband Peter (29 m) and I (27 f) have been married for about three years. We have one child together and I was pregnant with our second. I\u2019m western Canadian while he is from Germany. We lived in Canada for a long time, but because of inflation moving back to Germany seemed like a better option for us. We bought a nice house in Hannover where Peter is from.\u00a0 The day after our flights to Germany we all visited Peter\u2019s family. This was the second time I have seen them (the first was at our wedding). They greeted us and brought us inside of the house, fussing over my son. We had dinner, and soon we left the house, wanting to settle into our new home. We visited Peter\u2019s family often for the next few months. But I had started to realize that they would sometimes speak about me in German. They would make rude comments on my hair and makeup, question my fashion choices, and overall were just very unkind to me. They also said mean things about my pregnant belly which I was already insecure about. I ended up talking to my husband about this. I told him that I didn\u2019t like the way that they were treating me. I said that I hated how my every choice was judged. He told me that he would talk to his family.\u00a0 The next time that we went to his parents house, there were no more mean comments. For about three months it was like nothing ever happened. I gave birth to a perfect baby girl that we named Lilith. Peter\u2019s family was very upset when they heard the name. If you didn\u2019t know, Lilith means \u201cghost\u201d or \u201cof the night.\u201d We didn\u2019t pick this name because of its meaning, but because it is a name that every girl in my family has had for many years. My middle name is Lilith, along with my moms, my grandma\u2019s, and even my great grandma's.\u00a0 For a while I didn\u2019t visit my in-laws. I didn\u2019t want to hear them talk about how I shouldn\u2019t have named my daughter Lilith. But yesterday we saw them again. It was my mother-in-law\u2019s birthday. As soon as we showed up things started to go badly. Everybody wanted to hold Lilith which made my MIL upset because people weren\u2019t paying attention to her and made me overwhelmed. I didn\u2019t want people holding her. I was going through a pretty bad postpartum depression and it was still pretty early to see people. I let people look at her, but declined when anyone asked to hold her. During dinner I heard my SIL talking to my MIL in German. I heard her complaining about how she couldn\u2019t hold my baby. My SIL even had the audacity to call me, and I quote, \u201ca fat ugly hokey addict.\u201d I turned to my SIL and MIL and told them off in German. I basically said that I have always known what they have said about me, but calling me names was the last straw. I also mentioned how I have known German for almost my whole life. The table instantly blew up. People were yelling at me because apparently this was all my fault. I left with Peter and we haven\u2019t talked to them since. So AITH? ",

Last year I (17f) officially changed my first name from Evelyn to Indie (which was a nickname form of my original middle name). My parents gave in after realizing how serious I was about being Indie and how I was not warming up to or growing into Evelyn.  My brother and Hailey want an older/vintage name for their baby and Hailey asked me about 5 months ago why I disliked Evelyn enough to change the name. At the time she brought up how popular the name has become and how vintage is back. I told her I didn't like vintage names and to me it sounded really old fashioned. I told her the popularity didn't influence my decision. She wanted to know my reason for disliking older names and why I liked something like Indie instead. I didn't mind her asking this first time. She brought it up again a week later and she asked the same question and pressed more for why. She asked a third and a fourth time. I gave her the same answer and asked her why she kept asking me. I told her my answer wasn't going to change. By the seventh time she asked she admitted she was worried her baby would hate having an older name and wanted to figure out what she could do to prevent what happened with me happening to her. She also said she'd like me to rethink my name because she thought Evelyn was beautiful and she was sad I had chosen something like Indie over it. I asked her to stop so many times already and I even asked my brother to stop her. He told me I needed to understand it was the hormones. I can easily say she has asked me this more than 25 times by now. I'm not exaggerating that number either. Two weeks ago when she brought it up again she felt like I had made a mistake changing my name and how 30 year old me wouldn't be so against Evelyn. I told her 30 year old me can deal with it if that happens. She told me I didn't really have a good reason to like the name and Indie seemed like the kind of name someone young likes but not someone older. Then yesterday happened and I kinda lost my temper. She started out asking the same stuff and the baby is almost ready to be born so I know it's coming to an end but she asked me to really think about why and help her because she couldn't figure out what she'd do differently than my parents did. Then she said they really shouldn't have let me change my name so young. I snapped and I told her to stop asking me the same question because my answer won't change and her comments are not changing my mind because I don't like old fashioned names. I told her I think they're awful and I'm sick and tired of hearing about how much better they are and having her try to make me find a reason she finds acceptable. I told her just like she hates Indie, I hate Evelyn and she needs to let it fucking go already. She burst into tears and my brother got so mad at me. My parents were also like why did I have to speak to her so harshly. AITA? ",

        "selftext": "I(27M) have been apart of a small friend group, around 8 people total, basically since college. For some background, 2 people from the group, Susan and Greg, are just absolute leeches. Going out for lunch? Expect them to order the most expensive on the menu then feed you some sob story about their finances and then dumb half the bill on you. Last weekend, Dan, one of the people from the group, told me about a casual dinner . I told him how if Susan or Greg were there I wouldn't be able to come. He tells me that they would be there but I should just put my opinions aside and come just once. This is kind of where I might be an AH. I agreed with him and told him I would be there. I show up and we all get to talking. Everyone began putting in their orders, most of them spent about $40. There were only about 6 people there. When it gets to Susan and Greg, they both order expensive dishes, around $200. When it was my turn to order, everyone looked at me, but I just pick up the menu and point to the $4 Miller Lite and sent the waiter away. Dan asked why I hadn't ordered anything and all I said was that I lost my appetite. The other 2 friends got up as well to cancel their orders and just have drinks. After the main courses came out, I saw Susan and Greg picking at their food. The waiter then brings over the check. Greg then grabs the waiter and asks him to split the check 6 ways. I stand up and correct him saying the check was to be split 3 ways. Greg looks at me confused and asks why since we always split the bill. I reminded him that 3 of us had not eaten any food so we would just be paying for our drinks.  So basically at the end of the night, Dan, who probably only ate around $50 worth of food, was stuck with a $146.98 check at the end. (Yes, I remember the exact number.) I swear I saw his jaw drop when he picked that receipt up. I slid a $10 towards the check, said goodbye everyone, and walked out. The next morning, I found my phone full of texts from Greg and Susan telling me I was an AH for not ordering any food and forcing them to pay  more than they had accounted for. I honestly laughed because the steaks alone were more than what they had paid  but to each their own right? I also got a lot of messages from Dan saying that I could have just not came instead of pulling that stunt and getting him stuck with an outrageous bill. Edit: At this restaurant, the bar is separate so drinks are on a separate bill if that makes sense. And if anyone is concerned about leaving a tip, I live in Australia. Edit 2: Hey guys just wanted to clarify some things: 1. 90% of restaurants where I live they don't do separate checks and might separate the bill for you if you're lucky. BTW. This post is in AUD, so if you want the amounts in USD, you have to convert it.2. Dan could have easily asked Greg and Susan to transfer him the money if he wanted but he's always been about helping them through their financial hardship even though they're just using him and keeps dragging me into it. I admit what I did was immature but I'm tired of being forced to play along. It's his money and if he wants to spend it on them, that's fine, but I'm not paying for them.3. Also Dan's a really good friend of mine, albeit blind AF. I was just trying to get him to see what kind of people he was helping. I will admit it was a tad bit petty.4. Thank you for the gold.",

        "selftext": "So there's this new Target commercial going around where a little girl dresses as a hot dog, and it came on while my family was watching a scary movie. I (20F) am home from college for the weekend and brought my boyfriend, and my mother (57F) decided it would be hilarious to mention that she'd made me a hot dog costume as a kid, except the way she told the story, it was my request. She said that all the girls wanted to be Disney princesses, but I had asked to be a hot dog, and so she'd gone out of her way to make me that costume.  This is not what happened, and I said as much. What actually happened is that I wanted to be Snow White, and had told everyone, including the teachers, that I was going to be Snow White. I was obsessed with that movie as a kid, to the point where I would actually get invested in doing chores because I was cleaning up just like Snow White. My dad and I would watch that movie all the time, and I was very excited to be Snow White for Halloween, especially because my ballet studio was doing a special princess dance, for Halloween and we'd all signed up for special princess slots, and I'd shown up early with my dad the week before so I could get to be Snow White.  My mother decided that she wanted to be quirky and that Snow White was a bad role model after I got in trouble for trying to cook dinner for my family. I was about eight, and I tried to make hot dogs, like how she made food for the dwarves in the movie, and I made a mess. My mom surprised me on the day of with this crappy hot dog suit, and told me if I didn't wear it she'd never let me watch Snow White again. She took a million pictures, the other girls teased me for months, and it was one of the most humiliating moments of my childhood.  I told the real story, and mentioned that I got through the day by pretending that she was the evil queen making me dress in rags, but the rags happened to be a garbage meat costume. She got really quiet after that, and after we left, my brother says she was crying and looking at the pictures from that Halloween. I didn't want to make my mom cry, but it's a shitty memory for me and it felt like she was trying to humiliate me all over again in front of my boyfriend.  TL;DR: I called my mom out for forcing me to be a hot dog for Halloween and humiliating me as a child after she brought up the story pretending I'd wanted to be. AITA?",

I finally said that I was heading back to the ship. My mom waved me off.  The missed the departure. By a lot. Like 45 minutes. They got ahold of me through WhatsApp. They wanted to know why I didn't get the boat to wait for them.   I wanted to scream that they were not going to inconvenience 3,998 people because two could not understand what a schedule was.  They ended up having to fly to the next port from there and it was expensive. They are pissed at me for leaving them behind.  I don't know what I was supposed to do.

        "selftext": "I bought a house in a community without an HOA I wanted my home to be MY home, and that includes making it look the way that I want. I also chose a neighborhood that already has fun, colorful houses instead of just plain earth tones. I finally got to the point where I could repaint my house. I picked a soft peachy color with sage, blue, and soft and dark pink accents. Fun and colorful without being too out there. I think if you google \u201ccoolors blue sage peach\u201d you\u2019ll see a similar palette. My neighbor Paul fucking hates it and has been complaining since we started the project. He also made his opinion known that he hates our front lawn (lots of wildflowers and sunflowers, fun garden flags, a Little Free Library, etc).  Each and every time, I\u2019ve told him that I don\u2019t care. Truly, I don\u2019t. And I\u2019ve suggested a few times that maybe he\u2019d be happier in a HOA community that has control over everything and forces people into having earth toned homes. Paul got angry when I suggested that and said he\u2019s lived in his home for 15 years and shouldn\u2019t have to move. I told him okay, well you\u2019ll have to learn to live with a little color. Last weekend I was putting in pavers that my niece and I had painted together. They\u2019re all things like ladybugs, turtles, birds, etc in fun colors. I adore them and my niece is so excited she gets to be a part of my home. Paul came over to complain yet again, saying it was all an eyesore and my niece was here, so I just told him \u201cIt\u2019s time for you to grow up and get the fuck over what I\u2019m doing with my house.\u201d He got even pissier and told me that I have no right to talk to him this way, do I know who I\u2019m talking to, etc. I told him to just go away and get a fucking life. If he has so much free time to bitch and moan about a colorful house, maybe he should get a hobby. He stormed off, calling me a nasty piece of work. My niece was cracking up on the side. For the record, no one in my family is uptight, we really don\u2019t care about cursing. I know some people still clutch their pearls over it around kids (she\u2019s 15) but I\u2019m sure she says worse.  Anyway one of the other neighbors came to tell me that he\u2019s been flapping his yap about how disrespectful I am to talk to him like that. She told me that she knows he\u2019s a pain, but that he has been in the neighborhood forever and it\u2019s worth being nice to him. I don\u2019t know. Is telling him to get a life that big of a deal? AITA?",

        "selftext": "I don't normally post on reddit so please forgive me if I do this wrong.  I (33f) work in a very small, technical, specific, male dominated field. I won't give too much information on it as I think you could easily find my identity if I did, but let's just say it's a sub category of law.  I graduated 9 years ago (for anyone wondering, the system in my country is different than in the US so I only studied for 5 years), and am now a lawyer as well as a researcher. I published some work here and there but nothing too major, and no one outside of that field knows my work.  Yesterday I went to a bar with a couple of friends who introduced me to one of their friends who works in the same field as me. I was pretty excited to meet him because it's rare to meet people who work in that field. He doesn't exactly do the same thing as I do, he's not a lawyer but a legal advisor, but we work on the same topics. So naturally we started talking about our work.  At one point we were discussing a point on which we had different opinions, so I explained mine to him and he replied by saying that my opinion was based on nothing while his was based on the work of a professional (you guessed it, me). He basically started explaining my work to me, but in a completely wrong way and missed all of my points. I asked him if he was sure that that was what the author meant and he said that he was because it was pretty simple actually. For another good 20 minutes he explained all of it to me in details, like I was a first year law student. I didn't say anything because it was pretty funny to watch him say things that were completely wrong with so much confidence.  After that the topic changed and the night went on, but at the end of the night right before leaving I decided to tell him that I was actually the person that wrote the work he had quoted, and that he hadn't really understood it. He reacted very badly and got angry, and he told me that I had manipulated him to humiliate him. He yelled at me for not saying it was my work at the beginning. I simply replied that he had embarrassed himself and left.  I woke up this morning to texts from my friends saying I was wrong for causing drama and tension and that I could've been nicer to their friend. I'm not sure if I'm in the wrong there. I mean yes, I could've told him right away, but is it that big of a deal that I didn't? I'm not exactly sure. AITA?  Edit: I forgot to make this clear and maybe it's a bit of a misunderstanding, but both conversations happened only between the two of us. We were the only ones talking about our work and our friends also weren't really there when I told him that I was the author. So it's not like I publicly humiliated him. The only thing embarrassing for him here is that a woman seemed smarter than him, and I think that's what ge had an issue with. Edit 2: I've seen some comments claiming that this post was fake because that just doesn't happen, i've seen many other stories where the same thing happens, that's not realistic. I'm not trying to justify anything because I don't really care, but I just find it funny to see lots of comments from women sharing similar stories and then lots of comments from men saying it doesn't happen.

When I gave it to her she was excited and she started to look it over, I figured it was to see how it was put together, since she doesn\u2019t crochet.

( which is not the case her mother loved her very much to the point she literally gave her life so she could be here)  If this wasn't bad enough  A few days ago, she came home in tears with her hair butchered  they\u2019d cut off 2 inch of her ponytail well in class all while taunting her names and laughing at her reaction.  They will follow her through the halls to make fun of her on a regular basis now. Both my husband and I have been in touch with the school about the bullying more times than I can count. I emailed, called, even showed up in person to speak with teachers and the principal, but all I got were empty promises that they\u2019d \u201clook into it.\u201d Nothing changed, and my daughter\u2019s mental health has taken a hit  she\u2019s anxious, struggling to sleep, and now begs us not to send her to school. Finally, out of frustration and feeling like no one was taking this seriously, we reached out to a lawyer to explore legal action against both the school and the bully\u2019s family. Only when the school and her parents learned we were considering a legal action did they start to act. Suddenly, the school calls me to say they\u2019re moving the bully out of my daughter\u2019s class and claim they \u201chad a talk\u201d with her. The girl\u2019s parents reached out too, saying they\u2019d \u201ctalk to their daughter\u201d and promised it would stop. But honestly, I don\u2019t believe them. It feels like they're all saying this just to get me to back off and avoid the legal consequences. I worry that once the dust settles, things will go right back to how they were, and my daughter will still be dealing with this. My family thinks I should give the school and parents a chance now that they\u2019re finally taking action, but I feel like it\u2019s all for show. So, AITA for moving forward with legal action even though the school and the bully\u2019s parents now claim they\u2019re handling it? ",

The person in the next seat had been upgraded and they asked if I could switch seat with their wife as they had just gotten married and were on their honeymoon.  I congratulated him on his nuptials and asked where his wife was sitting. He pointed towards the back of the plane. In economy.  I declined to switch seats. He asked if there was any way to convince me. I offered to switch if he paid the difference between the seats. It is a goodly amount. I had been lucky to get mine at a decent price. It would only have cost him $1,000 AU$.  He said  that they were on a budget for their honeymoon. I congratulated once again and put in my earbuds. He muttered that I was an asshole. I said he was a prick for taking the upgrade instead of either sitting with his wife or giving it to her.  I told my wife about the incident and she thinks I should have done the nice thing.  For the record she hates flying in economy so I know she would not have switched. ",

He has 2 kids 28-Madison and 26-Brett. Note I am not calling them my stepkids because they explicitly told me I am not their stepmom, just their dad's wife. I didnt play a part in raising them so Im ok with that. Its always been a tense between us, Ive tried my best to be kind to them and have been generous when I can be, but they are very cold with me. Being a child of divorce, I can partially relate to a parent moving on so I try not to force anything.\u00a0 Madison recently got engaged and we are excited about it. Everyone was over recently and she asked about a wedding budget from us and Rob told her he was able to contribute 10k. She has bigger hopes for her wedding than this so she was upset and kept asking for more. Rob however is still working hard on building his savings back up. Before his late wife died, he basically wiped out his cash savings, had to cash out his 401k, and even took a small mortgage on his house to cover medical costs as well as life expenses since he had to cut back on working. Eventually he had to drop that job for a more flexible but lower paying one, so this 10k is actually really generous from him. Rob went to run an errand and it was just me and his kids. Madison then asked me if Im going to give any in addition to what her dad is giving. I told her were a marital unit and thats what we discussed together as a reasonable amount to contribute. She then said I should have known, obviously you married an older man for what he had, not for what you could give. I knew she didnt like me but this is the most flat out rude thing she ever said. I kinda lost it and said excuse me, who do you think has been paying the second mortgage your dad took out to pay his debts?\u00a0 Truth of the matter is I make more than her father by a large margin, I have no debt, and have been paying 70% of the household bills the whole time we've been married. The 10k were giving her, is available because Ive been able to subsidize her father's living expenses the last few years. I made it clear that not only am I not a golddigger, Im literally wealthier than my older husband. She called me stuck up after this and stormed out. Then she called her dad later and said that I told her that I blamed her mother for being sick for her not having a better wedding budget. I told him what happened and he was mad at her but also said I shouldnt have shared his financial details with his kids.",

We\u2019ve had to cut back on a lot of things, but it feels like no matter what we do, we\u2019re still living paycheck to paycheck and even pulling from savings. Recently, my mom (65F) came over to visit, and she noticed how stressed I was about the money situation. She offered some advice on how we could save money\u2014things like cutting down on takeout, meal prepping to avoid buying groceries multiple times a week, and switching to cheaper brands. My mom has always been frugal, especially when she was raising me and my siblings on a tight budget. I thought it made sense, especially since we\u2019re really trying to save wherever we can. I asked if she was willing to go through our spending and show where we could cut down. My wife agreed with this. She made a whole spreadsheet about our spending, and we are spending wayyyyy to much on fun stuff. We don\u2019t need Starbucks everyday and so on. It also became apparent that most of the fun spending was my wifes Tbh my wife didn\u2019t take the breakdown well and started arguing with my mom that her spreadsheet was wrong. She said that my mom\u2019s way of doing things is \u201coutdated\u201d and doesn\u2019t work for us. She doesn\u2019t want to give up buying organic produce, and she likes having variety in what we eat each week. I tried to explain that we need to make some sacrifices if we want to get out of this financial hole, but she kept insisting that things weren\u2019t as bad as I was making them out to be and that we just needed to \u201cride it out.\u201d My mom left at this point and we were still arguing, and she told me she can\u2019t give up her takeout . She also went on about my mom being wrong. That\u2019s when I lost my patience and said, \u201cYou\u2019re f***ing wrong. My mom is right. She managed to raise three kids on one income, and we can\u2019t even cut back on groceries for a few months? .\u201d My wife got really upset, saying I am being a huge jerk for winding with my mom and that my mom is outdated. She\u2019s barely spoken to me since, and now I\u2019m wondering if I went too far. But the way I see it, we need to be realistic about our situation, and my mom\u2019s advice could actually help us get back on track.",

The other three have kids, this post is about A(35F) and B(32F), A have 4 kids (17F, 15M, 14M, 9F), the younger 3 have severe physical and mental disabilities. B have 3 (12M, 7M, 2F), the oldest and middle have the same disabilities as my older sister's children, and the younger have down syndrome. They are both SAHM, all the children are in the disability programs my country offers but there is not much money left, after all the medical bills of therapy and meds they need. Their husband's have ok jobs, but with the severity of the children's disabilities it is hard to go by.  On the other hand, I am single, child-free by choice, went to university, totally debt free, have a masters, and work from home in my dream field. Last month I bought my first house. I invited my family and friends for a house warming this Saturday. I paid for two caretakers to care for their children so they could come. Everything was fine and fun. Until the end of the night, my friends had already gone home, and it was the three of us. They started to talk about me setting down, marrying, and having kids, since I bought a house. I remembered that I didn't want kids. This talk circulated several times. Until they asked me why foi the tenth time. I told them, besides really not wanting to have a child, I love my freedom, I love the life that I already have. Thinking about our family DNA, that is a high chance of having a disabled child, that means more work and sacrificing, I don't want to sacrifice myself. I want to have money for hobbies, to take care of myself, for expensive clothes and hairdressers, to travel, to live and not just survive. I love them, they're great mom's but I don't want to make the sacrifices to be the same, I would be an awful and spiteful mom, and no one deserves that. From everything I said, the only thing they listened to was about not wanting a disabled child. They went on a spiral about how much of a blessing their kids are, how I am an egotistical bitch, and so much more. They blocked me on social media, and aren't answering me in the family group chat. My mom called to give me a speech about how my disabled brother (36M)was a blessing in her life, how he is a gift from God, and uninvited me from christmas because my sisters won't come if I come. I called my brother (39), his two children are adopted. He admitted a long time ago this was due to the high chance of disability in our family. He told me my delivery is rude, but they also suck, they should know not everyone wants kids. He encouraged me to apologize because I know how they are. ",

They\u2019ve been friends for a long time, before Ian and I got together, so I know her fairly well too but we really have nothing in common and we\u2019re not exactly friends.  Jenna\u2019s wife Laura very sadly and somewhat suddenly passed in early March (she was terminally ill but responding to treatment very well and was expected to survive another 2-5 years). She\u2019s been leaning on Ian heavily for support which I understand but she\u2019s been at our house every single day since & even sleeping in our guest room most nights because she doesn\u2019t want to be home alone. which would be okay except she is getting more and more passive aggressive towards me and weirdly territorial of Ian. I\u2019ve reminded myself that I don\u2019t think I could stand to see a happy couple for months if I lost Ian and to be patient, it\u2019s not personal. My birthday was on Sunday. I got home Saturday after a morning out and Jenna was there. I was making small talk when i asked Ian what time he made dinner reservations for the next day. Jenna inserted herself right here and asked Ian if he was going to be out the next day and he said yes. She started panicking and saying that he couldn\u2019t and she wasn\u2019t ready to spend an evening alone. I was going to tell her that she could still hang out here while we gone and she looked at me and said \u201cdon\u2019t you have any fucking friends you can go with?\u201d And I just blew tf up\u2026. \u201cdon\u2019t *you* have any other fucking friends you can go bother?\u201d and so on; she called me selfish for \u201cmonopolizing *my husband*\u201d and I had enough and told her to get the fuck out of my house and not to come back, ever.  Ian had been trying to calm things down between us but it spiraled out of control fast and he ended up escorting Jenna out and telling her that he\u2019d come visit her in a few days but he would be backing my decision because of how she spoke to me. I was happy for his support and still am but it\u2019s been a few days and I just feel bad all around about it. I should\u2019ve been more understanding of her but I also feel like she should treat me more respectfully and I\u2019m not really sure if I overreacted ",

The bride is my favorite cousin and her husband is amazing.  During the formals the wedding party was great and I got lots of great shots.  When it came time to take pictures of different family groups with the couple people were assholes. They wouldn't stop talking or looking away from the camera. I tried politely reminding everyone that the camera was the big black thing on the tripod and that it took still images not video. I was repeatedly told to shut up and stop being a smartass and that they knew what a camera was.  I asked my wife to record video of the responses for me.  My cousin was delighted with the pictures from the ceremony, the formals, and the reception. She laughed her ass off at the family pictures. In about half of them people are looking off in all directions instead of at the camera. In most of those there are also people with their mouths open.  She thought they were hilarious and her husband agreed.  I started getting shit on social media from my family about the terrible pictures. I replied that I had tried to explain to them that the camera was the big black thing on the tripod and that it only took still pictures. They said I should have waited for them to be ready. So I started posting the short video clips of people being jackasses towards me.  My mom said that I went to far and that they won't ask me to take pictures for them again. A did a fake cry and said boo hoo. She called me a smart Alec.  Please let me state that I DO NOT THINK I AM THE ASSHOLE IN THIS SITUATION. But many people do. They are upset because they don't often dress up and get together and they didn't get good pictures. ",

While the three of us are close, I\u2019ve always known that Gaby and Shelly are the closest. They have a really sweet friendship. Shelly is getting married. Gaby is the maid of honor and I\u2019m one of the bridesmaids. Over the weekend, I went with Shelly so she could look at wedding dresses. Gaby was supposed to come with us but got called into work last minute. I helped Shelly pick out some dresses then she went with the consultant to try them on. Shelly asked that I take pictures and videos on her phone to send to her mom and Gaby. I was getting the camera ready when a text from Gaby came through. I didn\u2019t mean to click on it and was instantly going to click back out when I saw one of my Instagram pictures in their private chat from earlier that morning. Both were making fun of me for the face I was making and my outfit choice. It didn\u2019t appear to be very good nature. I admit, curiosity got the best of me so I searched my name in the chat. I found multiple pictures that I, my boyfriend or my mom have posted of myself, absolutely ripping them to shreds. Ranging from selfies to posed shots to even a few baby pictures. They\u2019d also make fun of me in general in terms of the way I talked, wore my hair and the way I ate. This went back as far as I could tell, at least a year. My heart broke. It all felt so juvenile and high school. While we all joke around, I would never do this to them nor have they ever even tried to instigate these types of conversations with me about the other one on one. I was in tears. As someone who was bullied all through middle and high school, it just brought me back to a horrible place. I put the phone in Shelly\u2019s purse and brought it to another employee, telling her to tell Shelly that I had to go. I drove home and had a long cry. Shelly texted me by the time I made it home asking where I went. I said I was going home and we could talk later. When she did call a few hours later, she was understandably confused and hurt that I left. I told her what I found, explaining that I only looked further because of the initial text I accidentally saw. She went off on me for looking through her private texts and said those were none of my business. She also told me I shouldn\u2019t have left the store without saying anything. I said I didn\u2019t want to make a scene but also knew I couldn\u2019t fake being happy for her. Shelly told me the texts were \u201call in good fun\u201d and clearly she loves me because I\u2019m going to be her bridesmaid. She added that I\u2019m only hurt because I chose to read all those texts. Later on, Gaby called to tell me that I invaded Shelly\u2019s privacy and hurt her by walking out. My boyfriend and mom think I did the right thing by walking out. But obviously, they\u2019re a little biased. I just want some unbiased looks: was I an asshole to look through the texts and then leave? ",

This is something a few people can't understand and some people call me Nicholas. Even teachers who see me on the class list as Nico and not Nicholas.  I'm a foster kid. I've been in the system since I was 2. My mom is the only bio family I know but she's not able to take care of me. I see her twice a year through court ordered visits. But nobody in her family and I don't have anything to do with my paternal side. I've been with my current foster family for three years and I'm really happy with my foster parents and foster siblings. My foster parents actually want to help the kids they foster and their kids are cool with their parents fostering and don't bully me or others for stealing their families. So I hope I get to stay until I age out of the system. My only problem is some of their extended family are snobs and they don't like calling me Nico. So they call me Nicholas even after being corrected a million times. My foster parents have explained that my name is actually Nico, not Nicholas. But the reply is always But Nico is short for Nicholas! A couple of the extended family have encouraged me to change my name because Nicholas sounds much more professional for an adult male, which I will be soon. I was like no thanks. My foster parents told me I should ignore whenever someone calls me Nicholas now. Unless they're new and just assume. But I can ignore their family members who do it. So that's what I did. I've ignored them a handful of times now and it bothers them so much. Yesterday it happened twice because one kept trying to call Nicholas over and I just didn't go. The other asked Nicholas to pass the potatoes at dinner and I kept eating and didn't pass anything. I was then called out for ignoring them and my foster parents said nobody knew who they were talking to because there was no Nicholas at the table. One of my foster sisters said she assumed it was her Nicole and they got confused and that's why she passed it instead. I was told I should be more open to the wisdom others offer with name suggestions and stop being rude by ignoring people. Even though my foster parents backed me up again. It made me feel a way because this really is my best foster experience and I don't want to piss off people in my foster family. So AITA?",

They only ever intended to have two kids and even with me and Cayla alone, they'd still struggle. My parents don't have great jobs. We never had much space in our house to begin with and now we're all crammed in. I started working at 13 to get money so I could pay for stuff I needed, like a laptop, which I didn't have access to when my school first shut down. We didn't even have internet then. My parents swore they were done with Robbie and they'd get us back on track and that I wouldn't need to work just to pay for stuff I needed for school. The weight of being the oldest is already a lot and I have paid for stuff before. I babysit so my parents can work nights or get a break. I take care of the house most days so they can focus on earning money. But it's a lot and we're really too big of a family for what we can actually afford. My parents get help from the government but it doesn't go far because they're not good with money or with buying groceries. When no baby came right after Robbie I thought they were serious and I started to think about my future. I'd love to learn to cook better and work in a restaurant. Not college exactly because we could never afford it and my grades aren't good enough but something. Then Monday my parents sat us down and told us they're having another baby and mom is like 14 weeks pregnant. They knew for 7 weeks and didn't want to tell us until they were ready. My siblings were mostly surprised but me? I said not again. I think I even cried a little which caught me off guard because I'm not a crier usually. This was apparently enough to break me though. My parents got so angry at me and told me to check my attitude. I told them they gave me this attitude by being so reckless and putting so much on me and now they've broken their promise and we're going to struggle even more than before. They told me to stop acting like they're doing something to me, that accidents happen and they'd never abort, even if they could. They told me to focus on making things okay and less on being so negative. I know people say that having money isn't as important as long as you have a loving family and maybe that's true for some people. But mine feel like a weight I have to carry and not something I'm blessed with. They're a responsibility on me, a burden really. And maybe that's awful to say but it's how I really feel. I hate worrying about what'll happen if they can't afford the bills or if my laptop breaks and I can't afford to fix it or get a new one. Or what if we can't afford food or we can but I have to pay for groceries instead of save. AITA?",

My son has High Functioning ASD, and honestly most people cannot tell, but it comes out in certain aspects of his relationships such as thinking about others, compassion, etc. My son also eats a lot of food- way more than someone for his age. He is not overweight in any way so the doctors have not considered this a problem. Here comes the problem- for years when we have ordered food, he has neglected to realize that the food we order is for the whole family, not just him. My husband and I have both spoken to him about this multiple times and usually he just gives half-hearted apologies. We are working on this with his therapist, among other issues he has. On Friday, my daughter had work after school so she drove herself there while my son took the bus home. He said he was hungry so I ordered a pizza and told him to save some for his father and sister. I only took a slice. Usually my daughter does not eat much (1-2 slices) and same thing with my husband. That would've left him with 5 slices of a LARGE pizza. About 2 hours later, my daughter comes home and sees the pizza box empty and starts balling. She usually is not one to complain about food and will usually just make her own food but she did not have time to eat before work today and during lunch she was making up a test, so she did not eat since breakfast. I was furious at my son and deducted the money for a new pizza plus a generous tip to the delivery driver from my son's bank account. My son saw and now he is pissed. My daughter thought it was the right thing to do, especially when this is about the 3rd time it had happened to her. My son's reasoning is that he doesn't work so his only sources of income are for his birthday and Christmas, so my daughter should've paid since she has a job. My husband and I both are on board with what I did, but idk, is my son right? AITA?   ***UPDATE: For everyone saying we are underfeeding him, we have tons of food in the house. The fridge is stocked, we have snacks, ingredients etc. My son refuses to learn how to cook, even when we have offered him cooking classes. Even without learning to cook, we have boxed pasta, popcorn, bread, vegetables and fruits, rice etc. all of which require no cooking ability. He simply chose to eat the whole pizza.**",

We did it when I had downtime so I didn't lose out on other money but it still sucked to get shafted.  So I put a construction lien on the house. He didn't care and I wasn't going to make him homeless.  That was two years ago. Now he got a new job and has to move. And to get a new house he has to sell his current house. Which he can't do because their is a lien against the property.  He called me to get me to remove it. He promised he would pay me as soon as it sold. I told him fuck you pay me.  My parents called me to tell me that they would pay what he owes. I said I would agree so long as he paid them back and if he didn't then any money he didn't pay back had to come out of any inheritance we were getting, god forbid. And that interest started accruing from the day of the loan. They agreed that that was fair.  My brother called me to scream at me for involving my parents and out inheritance. I reminded him that he involved them not me.  He finally took money out from a line of credit and paid me. With interest. I'm a reasonable man.  The house sold over asking and the finished basement suite made a huge difference on what he got.  He is still pissed at me for doing it but I did everything legal and by the books.",

        "selftext": "My mom and dad divorced when I was young. My brother loved the fact that our mom had no rules for him so he went with her. I abided by the custody agreement because I had no choice in the matter. My mom loves us both but she dotes on my brother like he farts perfume.  My dad kept the house. He had to buy my mom out. It was an old house built in 1953. It had old wiring and was really less than suitable for modern life. What it did have though was a huge yard that was great growing up.  My dad passed away during COVID. He left everything equally between my brother and I. I wanted the house. I told my brother that we should tear it down and put in infill housing like that neighborhood is zoned for. He just wanted money. I bought out his half of the house at the market value. It was sold as a teardown. He took the money and bought a car and went on a vacation. He still has money left.  Then I had the house demolished and built a fourplex. Each unit has three bedrooms, 2 and a half bathrooms, a small yard, and a garage. I kept one unit for myself  and rent each of the other units for $2,000 a month. My mortgage is $1,800 a month for the entire thing. So basically I live free and bank $4,000 a month.  My brother is pissed that I didn't give him a unit to live in for him since it was his home too. I actually offered to sell him one at cost and he said no.  I'm lost. I offered him a partnership, I paid a fair price, I offered to sell him a unit, I did everything to try and be fair. He thinks I tricked him because I get free money every month.  Our mom said she would be cutting me out of her will and giving everything to him if I didn't give him a unit or the income from one. I agreed that was fair and said that I would no longer feel the need to contribute to her upkeep or retirement when the time came.  I am being bombarded by the two of them but I took the risks. I took on the debt. This is my money now. ",

        "selftext": "I'm pregnant with a baby boy due in November. My fianc\u00e9 and I didn't care much about the sex of our child, so we didn't make too much noise about it once we found out. The only people we'd informed were our parents, their partners and our siblings. Prior to this, my father's girlfriend of 3 years had been asking me about my plans for a gender reveal party. I've always been clear about not wanting one. When I announced my son's gender to them, she expressed disappointment that I hadn't changed my mind about a party. I don't like gender reveals. Never have, never will. I prefer baby showers, which I think feel more about the actual child. I never tried to hide that opinion, either. Days later, my father's girlfriend invited me over for tea at their apartment (my dad was out of town). When I got there, about a dozen people popped out of hiding to surprise me. There were pink and blue decorations everywhere, which made what was going on pretty clear. As I stood there in shock, my father's girlfriend excitedly told me they were throwing me a surprise gender reveal party. Since I'd already told her, she had taken it upon herself to order a cake with colorful frosting, decorate the apartment and invite a bunch of people over.  The guests included her mother (whom I don't get along with), some of her friends, my MIL (not my mom) and four of my friends. As I later found out, my MIL and friends had been told I'd changed my mind about gender reveals. I had not. Still in the doorway, I looked over at everyone and said, It's a boy. You guys can go home now. I left without looking back. Hours later, my father called me furious that I'd ruined the party. He said his girlfriend had put a lot of effort, money and love into planning it, and I should have shown respect and gratitude for it. Apparently, she hadn't stopped crying since I left. It's been almost a week, and they're both still upset. Even after I explained I never wanted that party in the first place, they're insisting I could have sucked it up for an hour, or at least cut the cake. AITA?",

We are having hamburgers and hot dogs and just hanging out with the family. It's nothing fancy.  Steve asks, \u201cIs this it?\u201d when the first plate of hot dogs is done and waiting on the round of hamburgers.

He just looked at me and drank his beer, and I told him and my sister to go since this wasn't good enough for Steve. I gave my sister store-brand photo chips back and told her to get out.  My sister and Steve left, and the cookout was fine after that. My mom heard about me kicking them out and was mad at me and told me to apologize to my sister. Maybe there was a misunderstanding, but Steve was just an asshold commenting like that at someone\u2019s house and the first time you meet their family. My wife thinks I was right because Steve acted like that in her home, and insulting the host is a good reason to be kicked out. Others are split about 50/50 when they heard about what happened.",

I have a small company that makes me about $60,000 a year. I started it in high school. It is one of the reasons I graduated early from high school and why I got attention from recruiters. My parents said that since I was earning adult money I could take in adult responsibilities.  I thought that was fair. So I paid for all my own stuff starting at age 16. Not university. I got a scholarship. And the rent they charged me was minor. $300 a month.  But I basically considered my room to be completely mine after that. I kept it tidy because I like it that way. But they had no say in when I cleaned it. When I did my laundry, other than to not do it at a time when I would disturb the family for example 3 AM. I bought food for myself and I ate when I wanted.  They tried to say I was separating myself from the family but I saw it more as having my own schedule.  This year for spring break I went down to Mexico with friends. My parents were upset because they were hosting a big Easter family get together.  When I got back they said I was behaving badly by not being around for a family gathering. I said it was my last spring break in university and that I was not responsible for their schedule.  They said I was grounded and I laughed and said good luck with that. I went to my room and locked the door. They tried banging on it for my attention but I'm done.  My grandfather came over to talk to me later. He is the one ho helped me get my company started and he is always there for me. He said that I was rude to my parents when they were trying to be there for me. I asked him how much rent he charged my mom when she lived at home. He said it was ridiculous to think he would charge his kids rent. I told him that I had been paying rent for four years.  He went into the house and I herd a fight. When he came out he said that I need to treat my parents with more respect but that since they are my landlords they do not have a say over how I spend my time.  I'm avoiding my parents for now and I'm renting on Airbnb right now until I graduate. I took everything that was important to me and I left $600 for the last two months I had planned on being there.  They keep calling me but I am currently getting ready to move for my new job. I don't have the energy to deal with them.",

I am one of the longest-standing members, I have spent hundreds of hours on various aspects of it, I\u2019ve held small leadership positions in almost every area, and I have a large amount of experience being the president of another organization as well. When I first joined, things were not doing well, so I (with others) worked our asses off to improve that, and we did.  In fact, we did so well with improving the atmosphere that we had a massive amount of incoming members, who quickly became very close with each other (something we specifically encouraged) and have absolutely no idea how bad things used to be, or how much behind-the-scenes work it takes to maintain the way things are now.  I ran for president in the most recent election. I ran against five other candidates. Four of us had years of experience and had been preparing our campaign for months/years. One person (let\u2019s call them Alex) was extremely new (a few weeks), had zero experience at all, decided to run at the last minute, and had a very large friend group with other new members. Alex was barely allowed to run due to how new they were, but made the cut by a handful of days. You can see where this is going. It was extremely close between me and Alex, and I lost by one vote. The rest of the elected officials were all new members, of the same friend group, also without experience. Then, it was discovered that 9-10 votes, specifically the votes of other people in leadership positions who worked closely with me, were not counted. This was not intentional or malicious, simply a computer error.  Apparently every single one of them voted for me. I technically won. They tried to get the election results overturned because of it, but higher ups would not allow it, because they feared it would look like favoritism. At the end of the day, I was told to keep quiet and not let anyone know about this. That brings me to my current situation. Because nobody on the new executive team has any experience, I started facing a lot of pressure to take on a lower leadership position solely to guide them and ensure our hard work doesn\u2019t go to hell. I absolutely refused. In fact, I\u2019ve decided to drop all leadership roles and do absolutely nothing this year. This has lead to multiple people telling me that I don\u2019t truly care about the organization, that I\u2019ll be responsible if it falls apart, etc. I feel like it\u2019s a slap in the face to expect me to do what a president does without the title to show it. Am I the asshole for dropping all leadership positions and letting the new team do whatever the hell they want to do?",

My siblings were all named after family members like both my dad's and mom's families prefer. By the time they got around to having me they were live fuck this shit and told their family they were choosing a name based on what they liked and not based on family. So they named me Sunny. Yeah, the girl version of Sonny. I don't care. I don't think Sunny is girly because it has a u vs an o. But anyway. My parents started to regret my name when I was maybe 10? I don't remember exactly when but I can remember being about 10 and my parents started sometimes calling me by my middle name and only stopping when I told them it was weird and I liked my first name. When I was 13 they asked me if I ever went by a nickname and I said no. Last year they said some kids change their names before graduating high school because they want something more grown up and they want to save the added expense of changing the name on their degree. I was like oh, I guess if people want that it makes sense. Then I said it must suck to hate your name. Six months ago my parents said I look like a James nicknamed Jamie. I asked them why they thought that and they said I just had that look. They asked what I thought of the name and I said I like Jamie but prefer Sunny. Then they asked if I liked the name Luke and I said no. In June they asked me if I would consider letting them change my name to something different. They said they feel like they named me as a big fuck you to their families but felt bad that I had such an unserious name for a man. I told them I didn't want to change my name and I always loved the way they talked about finding my name. They said their feelings had changed and they felt like the name being cute and light and full of hope wasn't great for going into my adult years. They said they deeply regretted it. I told them I was glad they made the choice they did and they shouldn't stress it. But last week they got the paperwork for a legal name change and presented me with like three name choices and asked me to pick. They said they really didn't want to live with the guilt. I told them I'm not changing my name because of their name regret. I told them how I feel about my name is more important now. They told me I should at least think of their feelings and that I should consider the future and whether I'll be taken seriously. AITA?",

I started browsing normally and was finding some good stuff for once, then I saw a group of 3 women come in. One had a little computer for scanning books, the other two had ipads or something, I assume to check resale prices? Either way they were clearly resellers and started grabbing stuff after checking labels.  I felt a sense of dread because I wouldn\u2019t be fast enough to check, so I just swooped everything off the rack and into my cart in my size.  When the two got to me they started staring. I said \u201cWhat?\u201d and one was like \u201cWe\u2019d like to be able to see what\u2019s on the rack too.\u201d I said that they could as soon as I was done.  She scoffed at me and said \u201cThat\u2019s rude, we'd like a chance to shop these clothes too.\u201d I just ignored her and started looking at things one by one, taking my time, then putting them right back on the rack. The women were getting mad and snatching things basically out of my hand. I held up a nice top and one of them tried grabbing it OUT of my hand and I said \u201cExcuse you\u201d and turned my back to her. They got all pissy and one stomped away to get a worker. The worker came over and asked what was going on. I said I was looking at the items from the rack, same as anyone else. They said I was \u201choarding everything\u201d so they couldn\u2019t get a chance to look. The worker said that I wasn\u2019t doing anything wrong, and then said to me \u201cThank you for putting everything back when you\u2019re done.\u201d I finished what I was doing with the women breathing down my neck and took my clothes to go try on. One of them kept following me and asked me what the fuck my problem was, why I was being such a bitch, etc. I said \u201cSorry that you\u2019re having a bad day, but it\u2019s really not my problem.\u201d AITA?

But since the accident. it feels like I don't deserve to have any good things happen to me or at least I\u2019m not allowed to talk about them. Every time something positive happens in my life I get shut down by my family. When I got a promotion at work last year I was so happy and excited to tell them. I thought my family would be happy for me but when I tried to share the news. My mom pulled me aside and told me to not now because my sister had a tough day. I ended up keeping it to myself. 8 months ago my boyfriend proposed. When I told them. My mom immediately changed the subject later telling me that my sister was feeling down about her own marriage struggles. It\u2019s like anything good in my life is an offense to my sister\u2019s situation. This happened a few days ago. I\u2019ve been saving up for years to buy my first new car. I finally managed to do it and I was so excited. I thought my family would be happy for me. So I decide to tell them. As soon as the words were out of my mouth the room went dead silent. My mom whispered to me This isn\u2019t the time. think about your sister My sister looked so sad and I instantly felt like the worst person in the world. I just couldn\u2019t handle it anymore and I said Can't I share anything good in my life. I thought you\u2019d all be happy for me no one knew what to say and I left the house. I\u2019ve never done that before. Now I\u2019m filled with regret and confusion. I love my sister and I never want to hurt her but it feels like I\u2019m not allowed to have anything good happen to me. It\u2019s getting to the point where I feel like I\u2019m walking on eggshells all the time. I understand my sister\u2019s life has changed drastically and I\u2019m genuinely supportive and have always been there for her. But sometimes I just want to be able to share my own life too. I feel so guilty for even feeling this way like I\u2019m being selfish or inconsiderate. Her husband and even my parents share things about their lives freely and no one seems to mind. But as the younger sister I\u2019m not allowed to share anything good in front of her so I don\u2019t hurt her feelings. I get it. I really do. I understand she\u2019s going through a lot and I don\u2019t want to add to her pain. But it feels like I\u2019m not allowed to have any joy in my life around my family. Now I know I owe my sister an apology for how I reacted. I never want to make her feel sad but I\u2019m struggling with how to approach my family. I don\u2019t feel like I should apologize to them. And honestly I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be sharing anything with them in the future.",

        "selftext": "My father walked out on my mom when she was pregnant with me (16m). They were married for like 5 years at that point but he was cheating a lot. Mom trying to divorce him went through hell because they'd picked up and moved. He never met me. He didn't show up at court for their divorce, or for custody, or for child support. He went to jail three times for failure to pay child support and for trying to avoid child support by quitting his jobs and not declaring his new place of employment.  I still haven't even met him. But around a year ago he moved back with his family (the affair partner and their kids). He has a daughter 5 months younger than me a son about a year and a half younger and some other kids who are younger again but I don't know their ages. I only know the older two ages because of school and sharing some classes with his daughter. She has tried to connect with me but I told her I wasn't interested, we're not family, I don't want to know the affair family. Even though she was upset and cried a little in front of me, she didn't give up. And when we returned to our classes in August she was suddenly in four of mine instead of one like last year. So I went to our teacher who assigns a lot of group stuff and asked her to never pair me with her. I explained the reason why and she was surprised but agreed that it would be for the best to avoid hostility during the project and especially if others are working with us. Twice she has tried to claim me as a partner or make me a part of her group. The first time as her solo partner and the second time in a bigger group. Both times our teacher refused. This made her realize what I'd done. She told her parents, they went to the principal and demanded a meeting with me and my mom. Mom went but left me out of it and explained why to the principal and told him she didn't think the first time I meet my father should be when he wants to berate me for not working with his daughter. They tried to say I was bullying their daughter and I should be facing suspension OR be forced to make it up to her through some kind of buddy program. The principal didn't take it seriously. But his daughter and son now stare at me a lot more in school the last couple of weeks, since the meeting, and a couple of her friends said I was such a dick for embarrassing her like that and not getting to know her.

My daughter backed this up and said that she picks at her food at school. I thought it was an eating disorder at the time and told my friend to take her to the doctors. My friend needed to leave for a work trip this week and asked me to watch over her. No big deal, she will stay over for the week. First night I made meatloaf and she ate it. She didn't get sick. The rest of the week anything I made she would eat no issue. She even came back for seconds most meals. At the end of the week she asked me when my food didn't make her sick. Apparently she only eats TV dinners at home which make her feel like crap. The school food also sometimes makes her sick so she is cautious about it. My guess is their is an allergen in preservative foods. She needs to get that checked out I dropped her off and pulled my friend to the side and told her everything. I told her that she really needs to cook and take her to get her allergy checked out. She was not happy I said this and basically called me a jerk for overstepping AITA? Should I apologize.",

A tenant has moved in downstairs and she leaves the back door unlocked to allow herself to come and go without taking her key. She isn't supposed to do this, and she has been told multiple times to take her front door key in case the door locks which she has ignored. She has started treating me like a literal doorman - knocking loudly on my windows and repeatedly buzzing my apartment to try to get me to open the door for her. It is daily and it riles up my dog every time - and it always occurs after 9pm. I have let her in twice in good faith, then told her the third time to take her key and that I will no longer be answering. She decided to go out with her dog this evening and again didn't bother to take her key, when she started buzzing and knocking on my windows loudly. I shut off my buzzer, gave my dog a treat and closed the doors, deciding to ignore her and continue watching my movie instead.  This is where I could be TA, it's dark out at the moment, late and she's outside by herself with her dog, shes been out there for about 45 minutes, we also live in a shady area - not *dangerous* but definitely not pleasant at night. She has been sat outside on the doorstep on her phone angrily ranting about me to her friends - like I'm her DAD. I don't know this woman aside from her treating me like a concierge. AITA? Edit for update: I opened the door. I said I wouldn't, but quite frankly, I literally couldn't go to sleep knowing she and her dog were out there. I went downstairs and opened the door and told her that this was the last time and I will be reporting to management and calling the police if she knocks on my windows anymore. I'm gonna just hope that a few hours outside has got the message across - sorry for everyone who told me not to give in, but it's nearing midnight here and as much as she pisses me off I'm not about to leave her out there.

        "selftext": "I'm 31F and my husband is 36M. We have two boys, a 5yr old and a 7yr old. My husband works in an office and he has the option to work a few days a week from home, but he prefers not to because he says it's easier to focus in the office. I run a small business from home. I don't have a lot of daily work, just some emails and planning (maybe 3 hours a day?)  but the business does make about a third of our household income. But my younger son is home all day and just dealing with him takes a lot of energy. He's really high energy and will probably wreck something if you leave him alone for an hour. And then the older one comes home at 3 and both of them are with me until 8 or 9, which is when my husband usually comes home. A few days ago, I was really tired and I didn't make dinner. When my husband came home I asked him if we could just order something. He was also tired and we were both short tempered so we ended up snapping at each other.  He said I should have at least ordered before he got home and he was hungry, I said I forgot and it's not fair that food is always my problem. He said that I'm home all day and I even admit I don't have much work to do, so I'm basically a SAHM and should at least take care of dinner. I said he has no idea how much I do everyday, and he said he'd handle the kids for an entire day while also working from home just to prove it should be easy for me. I said sure, so he made the arrangements to work from home yesterday.    I slept in, and when I woke up he was already frazzled from getting the older one ready for school. He ended up having to cancel a meeting to make breakfast, and was worried about that. Then when he took another meeting later on, the boys went out to play in the yard and got super muddy and left footprints all over the house. which he then had to mop, and I didn't help at all. By this point I did feel sort of guilty because it was definitely harder for him to take care of work at the same time, but all I wanted was an apology. He said he was doing this to show that I do nothing all day, and if he just admitted he was wrong I would have helped out straight away.  Later on he had another meeting, and he told the boys not to bother him for an hour. But about 20 mins in, they got in an argument about something and our younger one went into my husband's room to complain. He was really loud and my husband's video was also on, then he told the kid to leave him alone but he was upset and crying and wasn't listening. After a few mins my husband went back to the meeting and apologized to the other people. when it was finished, he was really angry at me. he said I could see what was happening and I just watched him struggle without helping. I said all you had to say was please help, he said I shouldn't be so petty and prideful. This probably made him look a bit stupid in front of his manager, but it was only a few minutes and I don't think It was the huge deal he made it out to be. ",

        "selftext": "My girlfriend wanted a pizza. I have really good frozen pizzas from the local Italian market. They are made fresh and if you do them up on a pizza stone the come out perfect.  I have made these for us many times. It is a simple process. You take the pizza stone and put it in the oven let the oven preheat. Put the pizza on the paddle and slide it onto the hot stone. Once it's ready you slide the paddle under the pizza and pull it out. Put it on the carving board and cut it.  Easy right?  Nope.  My pizza stone was dirty, it is scorched not dirty, so her brilliant idea was to make the pizza on my plastic cutting board.  Because that way she could just take the cutting board out with oven mitts and cut the pizza without having to use all the tools.  I got home to see black smoke coming out of my house and my girlfriend on the phone with 911.  My dog is not on his leash and he's going crazy.  I go to the front door to see if it's hot in the house or if I can see flames.   No flames, no heat. I get to the stove and turn it off. I open the sliding door to let out more smoke and get my leash on the way out.  The firefighters are there within five minutes and the smoke is already dissipating. They go in to make sure.  All clear.  Thank god they were there less than an hour. It is covered by the city. If it was over an hour I would have been charged for the response.  My oven is fucked though. And I have a lot of smoke damage to clean up.  I told my girlfriend I was glad she was okay but that she is a dumbass and she wasn't allowed in my house alone for a while. I took her key away.  We do not live together. But she has roommates and likes having a big house to herself on her days off.  She says that it's a mistake anyone could make and that I'm an asshole for calling her names. Yes she said those words. She says it's my fault for not just getting microwave pizza and having to eat fancy. ",

        "selftext": "Ever since my dad was a kid our family has done monthly family dinners, nicer ones than your average family dinner. It's something our family did when my siblings and I were kids too. We'd have grandparents over and we'd all have a nicer dinner together. When my siblings and I grew up we still did it only instead of what happened before, where branches broke off over time and did their own, they decided we should include partners/spouses and our kids as a whole in one. By the time I was 19 the family had decided they would take turns hosting each month to lessen the burden. My wife was excited to be a part of them at first. We started during our relationship. I did the cooking to start and then she took over after a while because she wanted to. My family had seemingly got along with my wife before this point but they were overly harsh of her cooking (with the exception of my two younger siblings). She tried to make them happy but no dice. I told them they could be kinder. They said she should cook better or cook different things. My wife didn't make anything they don't eat. But nothing was right. She grew frustrated and I grew suspicious.  So we hosted a couple of months ago and I told my wife we were going to pretend I did the cooking. Just to see. She told me she felt like they just weren't fond of her food. I pointed out nobody had the same amount of complaints as them and they even criticized the steak and potatoes they all seemed to go crazy for. She went along with the plan and when my family thought I'd cooked it? They loved it. Said it was so good my wife had decided to let a real talent take over. That it was so nice to have something a little different (curry) and all this very lovely stuff. My younger brother and sister weren't fooled. But they enjoyed watching the rest of the family dig a hole. When the rest of my family heard it was my wife's food and not mine? They tried so hard to backtrack on all the nice stuff. The rest of the dinner went in tense silence and my wife's eyes were opened. I told her I was done with these dinners and she was my priority. She felt a little bad. I told her we could have dinners with my younger brother and sister sometimes. It's less stress anyway. When we didn't show up to last months dinner or this one, my parents and siblings started asking questions. I told them each time we weren't going again but missing two made it sink in. They told me we need to be there. I said never again. My wife doesn't deserve their disrespect. I told them they ruined what they wanted by being assholes to her. They said I was overreacting, making very relationship harming choices, and treating them badly for simply having issues with my wife's food. They also said to think of future kids and how they'll miss out. Some of it got to my wife a little which I have tried to reassure her about. AITA?",

This was a once-in-a-lifetime experience for me, and I\u2019d been waiting months for it. I sacrificed a lot financially and mentally to make it happen. Since it was my first (and probably only) time seeing them, I went all out: I bought GA tickets and arrived at the queue at\u00a0**5 a.m.**\u00a0(even though the doors wouldn\u2019t open until 6:30\u20137 p.m.) in freezing cold weather.\u00a0I waited all day\u2014hungry, cold, and dehydrated\u2014but it was worth it because when the doors opened, I secured a\u00a0**front-row barricade spot**, right up against the stage. This was my dream spot. Then, a guy behind me tapped me on the shoulder and told me he was disabled. He said the venue was supposed to let disabled attendees in early, but they hadn\u2019t. He asked me to give him my spot at the barricade.\u00a0Here\u2019s the thing: I know this venue is\u00a0**very accommodating for disabled attendees**. I actually have friends with disabilities who\u2019ve gone to shows here, and the staff always ensures they get to the front row safely during a designated time frame before it gets too crowded.\u00a0 Now, I\u2019m a\u00a0**very short person (155 cm/5\u20191\u201d)**, and this guy was\u00a0**extremely tall**\u2014easily over\u00a05.5\u00a0If I gave him my spot, I wouldn\u2019t be able to see anything at all because he would completely block my view. I honestly would\u2019ve been willing to move if he wasn\u2019t so tall or if I could still see from the second row. However, in this case, I knew I\u2019d lose the view I had waited more than 10 hours for. I tried to compromise. I pointed out that the\u00a0**right side of the barricade**\u00a0was still open and suggested he go there. Since he\u2019s so tall, he\u2019d still have a great view and could hold onto the rail for support. However, he refused, saying the view wasn\u2019t as good as where I was. While we were talking, that section filled up, and he became more insistent. He said he\u2019d have a hard time if he couldn\u2019t take my spot. At this point, I got frustrated and explained: 1. If his disability was that serious, he should be in the\u00a0**accessible section**, which is specifically designed for attendees with disabilities.2. If he insisted on being in the standing section, he should\u2019ve brought a support aid, like a cane (I\u2019d seen someone nearby with one).3. If he spoke to security, they could escort him to the\u00a0**front-row disabled seating**, which has a fantastic view and is much more accommodating. After hearing this, he called me an asshole, told me to get fucked, and left. I feel like he just wanted my spot and wasn\u2019t being truthful. The venue offers several options for disabled attendees, and I tried to direct him to alternatives. I feel bad for saying no but I don\u2019t think it was fair for him to ask me to sacrifice my entire experience. So,\u00a0**AITA**\u00a0? EDIT: Regarding the man\u2019s height, after everyone pointed it out I've realized I indeed made a mistake. I don\u2019t live in a country that uses the metric system and I should\u2019ve double-checked my conversion instead of estimating from memory. I meant to say he was over 170 cm, probably around 175-180.",

None of my family members offered any help or support. We were essentially on our own. The only person who helped us was my father, who was a great support system both emotionally and financially.  When my father passed away two years ago, he left me a significant inheritance. This money allowed me to buy a house and provide a stable and comfortable life for my son and me. Since my husband left, my son and I have become very close. We\u2019ve been through a lot together, and our bond is incredibly strong. I would do anything for him. Recently, some of my extended family members have fallen on hard times and asked if they could move in with us. Given our history, I was initially hesitant. I discussed it with my son, and he was very much against the idea. He remembers how nobody was there for us when we needed them the most and feels strongly that they shouldn't benefit from our home now. Understanding his feelings and valuing his comfort, I decided to tell my family that they couldn't move in with us. Now, they\u2019re upset and accusing me of being selfish and ungrateful. They say that I owe them support because we\u2019re family.

My brothers are on their side so I am here to ask if I'm in the wrong.  AITA?",

        "selftext": "So basically my group of friends (about 8 total) get together every week for D&D. There are only two woman in our group (including myself).  It's always at friend A's house because he's the DM and has his fancy table and his whole set up there. A has a fianc\u00e9 who recently moved in with him. She's cool and I don't really have anything against her she just has her own group of friends and doesn't have the same interests as us or 'click' for a lack of a better word with her husband's friends (us). She recently has been trying to get more into A's interests so she has been there for our games. She doesn't play with us, just kind of watches and plays on her phone, which is fine of course.  A has a table he set up specifically for the game, one with a recessed middle so we don't have to put away our stuff at the end he just puts a leaf over the top to protect it. Because of that in order to move around your character you have to lean forward or stand to be able to reach. Now I have big boobs. I'm not a particularly big woman, I'm like in my late 20s, 5' 4'' and 155ish pounds with H-cup breasts. And yes, before you ask I have already started the process of getting a reduction and I cannot wait to have this weight off of me!   The problem is that when I lean forward to move my character my breasts squish against the side of the table and after awhile it gets uncomfortable and painful. So I've taken to lifting up a little and settling with my breasts sitting on the edge of the table. It doesn't push them up or call attention to them, to be honest I don't even think it's noticeable. With the height of the chairs I can still sit normally with them there and lean forward without it hurting my boobs. I've been doing this for months and no one has said anything. But last week A's fianc\u00e9 snapped out of no where and accused me of trying to put myself on display and to put my boobs away cause no one cares. I was shocked and didn't know what she was talking about at first, neither did anyone else until she pointed at my boobs and called attention to what I was doing.  She got really really upset and caused a scene and we ended the night early. She's still mad at me and doesn't want me to come over to the house anymore. I've apologized and said I'd try not to do it anymore and even told her how I'm going to get it reduced next year. She called me a show off and slut and is asking A to stop being friends with me. I'm at a loss. I do this all the time, I've even caught myself doing it at home with my own table without even thinking about it. AITA?",

        "selftext": "My cousin is approaching six-hundred pounds and requires a mobility scooter, as walking even short distances is very painful for her.  In July, she has an out of state wedding to attend, and I was asked to taxi her to and from the event, as I'm not currently employed so my calendar is open. Unfortunately, my car will not carry a mobility scooter, so my cousin will be required to use a wheel chair.  The problem is that this event is being held in a public park.  I can barely push her wheelchair on a paved surface, let alone across grass and dirt.  I tried contacting a couple rental agencies in the area but they would not lease scooters in this case because of the off-road use.  My aunt and uncle have also declined to loan me their truck, which is how my cousin normally gets around, because I have a pretty shitty driving history. I did look into renting a vehicle that could carry the scooter, but my cousin cannot afford to pay for that and obviously with me being jobless, I can't either. The distance from parking to the event area is about forty-yards, which my cousin cannot handle walking.  About the best solution anyone's come up with is that the party has a flat bed they're using to tote supplies from the cars, but my cousin says she would feel humiliated having to be rolled in like that. My cousin is furious with me, saying I'm shaming her by saying I cannot push her, but I feel it's the honest truth.  Like 100% the thin wheels of the wheelchair are going to dig into the ground, and I am not strong enough to handle that.  My cousin has done a lot for me in the past, so I do feel bad saying no, but I feel like I've looked into every option at this point.  AITA for not being willing to just go and give it the college try? Also, please don't degrade my cousin.  I know I can't stop you, but it's all been said before.  Please and thank you. **EDIT:** I honestly never expected so many responses, and I want to express my appreciation to the vast majority who respected my request not to berate my cousin.  I also wanted to thank everyone who messaged me with their own thoughts.  I feel like you all have given me some very solid talking points that may hopefully help me with this discussion with my cousin.  Thank you all! **UPDATE:** This morning I got a call from my Aunt who said my cousin was no longer going to be attending the wedding.  Sadly, my cousin was hostile towards the bride's mother, who had selected the venue, and so her invitation was retracted.  I feel depressed because I know my cousin did really want to go, but I still don't think I was wrong to tell her I couldn't handle this. I really do appreciate all of you who supported me in my decision, as well as those of you who may have felt otherwise but were still so kind to me.  Thank you all.",

        "selftext": "Hi. Back in 2008 when I started University, I rented a 2 bedroom apartment with my (exex)girlfriend at the time and my friend & his girlfriend.  We got a great deal for it, as the owner of the place lost his job because of everything that happened back then and decided to try her luck abroad where she still lives. Years went by and after University my friend and his GF decided to find a place of their own, as we had full-time jobs, renting this apartment together did not seem expensive anymore, and also did not seem expensive to rent alone after we broke up some time later. So there I was, alone in a 2-bedroom apartment in the central part of the city.  The owner decided that she was too lazy to mess with bills and stuff every month and made arrangements for me to pay everything directly, as I earned her trust, I still pay her monthly rent which is very cheap for today and deal with everything else having her authorization. Because of the perfect location, my second bedroom was basically free BNB for my friends who did not live in the city and I did not mind, it is good to have company if you live alone. In 2020 I met a girl who was in a rush to get married and as I was madly in love we did in 2021.  For some reason, I never told her the story of how I rented the place or that it was a rental at all, it just never came up! I have been so used to the fact that I am an authorized representative with building cooperative things etc, that I refer to it as my place.    Our relationship started to cool down and we found out that we were not perfect for each other after all, so divorce it is. So we did the paperwork for divorce and she is moving out.  A few days ago I received an email from her with a real estate valuation document as an attachment - while I was not at home she wasted 500\u20ac for someone to evaluate an apartment that does not belong to us... and wrote that I probably have to take a loan to pay her the 50% of that.  I replied to her, didn't I ever tell her that this place is a rental? Why does she even assume that I can afford a 2-bedroom apartment in the city centre? She knows where I work and how much I earn. She called and screamed at me, that I had lied to her for years and hid the fact that the apartment was rental! Then she tells me that well, she will take the car as we got that together!  And I was quiet for a moment and then told her: You do know that is a lease right? The owner of the car is the bank!  Then she demanded that I pay for the valuation and I replied I did not ask you to do it!  She called me an asshole and ended the call. Of course, she told our whole friends group how I lied to her during the whole marriage and there was a discussion in a messenger group with friends that if is it a lie or not, whether was it an asshole thing to do, some agree with me and some with her.    My best friend told me, that this is a perfect topic for a Reddit thread!  Now I ask you Reddit, AITA?",

        "selftext": "My 9yo son Loren had his appendix removed this morning. He had a basic understanding of the surgery but the only hang up he had was having to wear nothing but a hospital gown. No socks or underwear. When we got to the hospital room to get him prepped, he told his mom/my ex and her sister/his aunt to turn or to leave when he had to undress. Obviously he was fine with my being there and needed help. After the surgery, me, my ex,her sister, her 13yo niece and my 18yo son were in the recovery room. He were waiting for Loren to sober up and get discharged. He started to come to and whispered to me that he wanted to put clothes on because wasn't comfortable wearing nothing but a gown in front of three girls. At that same time, a female nurse came in to get his vitals and was talking to my ex. I asked if they could all step outside so I could help Loren get dressed. They looked bewildered at my request. The nurse then said she'd help me dress him because my son was still a bit weak. I said no thanks. My teen son will help out.  She asked if I was serious by asking her to leave over this and I said yes. My son doesn't feel comfortable getting dressed in front of four females. The nurse said she's been a nurse for years and has heard of anything crass. I said you're comfortable, my son isn't and your being insensitive is what's crass and clueless. My said I was being dramatic. They left and me and my other son got him dressed. My ex called me and said that I owe her and everyone else an apology. I refused. I said if the roles were reversed then you'd have a very different opinion. Also Loren has to take a bath for the next few days and she was crazy if she was expecting Loren to let her wash him or even be in the bathroom with him. It's different with me or his brother or friends and I don't have to convince her for me to be right.  Edit: For the record, the gown he was wearing was made out of paper. It wasn't even cloth. My son was dying to get out of it. He was basically naked. I don't think my son would had minded a male nurse at all but since me and my older son was there the thought of requesting a male nurse didn't cross my mind. I don't know if they had a male nurse available at that moment because the nurse made a comment that they were short staffed but all qualified. I wasn't going to argue with her over who got to put on my son's Minecraft underwear or zipped his hoodie. It's a waste of my time. She did mention how she didn't want him to get hurt with my dressing him and I said then you best let me handle it because he'll fight you. Update: I did have to take him back to the hospital this morning because he couldn't pee but had to. He was in a lot of pain. At the hospital, I \u00e0sked if a nurse was going to see my son before or after his male doctor and they said yes. I asked for a male and they said they'd ask the head nurse. She asked why it was so important to have a male nurse. I told her we can schedule an appointment to fight over it after my son sees the doctor. They did find a male nurse and my son was totally relaxed around him. The male nurse said a lot of female nurses take it personal when patients ask for a male nurse and it's always been that way.  Fortunately my son didn't need a catheter and is fine.",

I have talked to her about this multiple time. My birthday was yesterday and I asked her to give me a book. It was only 25 dollars and I sent her the link. I opened the gift and she made some homemade bookmarks. It wasn't even the type oof bookmarks I like. They were made from fabric and I like the wooden ones.  I must have made a face because she asked what was wrong. I told her I didn't want these. I made it so clear what I actually wanted and I have talked to her so many times.

        "selftext": "For about 11 years now, I've (37M) been pretty close with [let\u2019s call him] John (38M).  We met at a job  in my mid 20s and were pretty regular company up until the pandemic, where our hanging out (including a circle of mutual friends) has taken a decline but isn\u2019t extinct. John and his partner [let\u2019s call her] Jane (36F) have been together for about 8 years now, engaged for a little under 2 years, both with a child from previous relationships, so they have taken trips with their kids near-yearly, and I\u2019ve been happy to help visit John\u2019s (now their) home and check on things, take care of their animals, etc while they're gone.  I\u2019ve helped them out with other projects/tasks over the years and most recently picked up Jane from the airport returning from a work-trip and got her home this past winter during a snowstorm because my vehicle could handle it.   Generally, I have been present and helpful on top of our base friendship. About 5 weeks ago, I find out from a mutual friend their wedding is coming up, and invites went out a while ago, everyone in our circle but me invited. As a gay guy, I\u2019ve experienced being iced-out of some of my straight friends\u2019 lives and events in ways minor and pronounced, but this one has definitely been something that has had me thinking about my time and energy with people.  I decided I would take the hint and begin to distance myself. Three days ago, John texts me asking if I am around in early-to-mid August.  I say I am.  John asks if I wouldn\u2019t mind visiting like I have before to look after the animals and property, I said \u201csorry, I can\u2019t.\u201d  He calls to talk about it.  We run through the same conversation, polite but a bit tense, so I finally say \u201cI just won\u2019t be visiting your home.\u201d  After a moment of silence, I bring up that I\u2019m disappointed that I appear to be the only person in our group of friends not invited to his wedding, and that I can't be helping like I have before if I\u2019m just a background friend at this point.  I wrap up the call positively and sincerely with me wishing them a good wedding and trip, and that maybe we can grab drinks soon. Jane reaches out two days ago sending follow up texts saying John is upset about what I said and with her because she made the final calls about friend invites, and that I am taking this the wrong way, there is only so much capacity and that the others in our friend group have partners that took up space. She adds that she hopes I\u2019ll change my mind and help out them out because it would put John\u2019s mind at ease. I\u2019m not entitled to the company of others or invitations to anybody\u2019s events, but am I wrong for setting my own boundaries in response to theirs?  I try not to frame my friendships as transactional, but they obviously want something out of me here despite their not inviting me and then avoiding even bringing it up with me until they needed help with covering their honeymoon. UPDATE: John and I met up.

        "selftext": "A few months ago I attended a close friend\u2019s wedding with my husband. I wore a YELLOW dress. Think like Belle in Beauty of the beast yellow. Bumble bee yellow. So yellow that I did not question if it was appropriate or not to wear to a wedding and neither did my friends nor family.  I arrive at the wedding, we have the ceremony, the cocktail hour, the dinner and the reception. I get many compliments on the dress and the bride even comments on how much she loves it several times.  Towards the end of the reception the venue dimmed the lights and turned on some blacklights. These blacklights made my dress appear more white than yellow.  A member of the wedding party approached me while the blacklights were on and stated that I needed to leave because my dress was \u201cwhite\u201d and \u201cinappropriate.\u201d I stated that the dress was yellow but the blacklights were making it appear white. The member of the wedding party stated that if i didn\u2019t leave she would \u201cmake me.\u201d I stated I\u2019m here to celebrate my friend, repeated that the dress was yellow and said I will not be leaving early (bride and groom hadn\u2019t left yet and I came from overseas). The conversation while heated, did not have raised voices or foul language from either side. But I will say it was tense.  The wedding party member walked off and I watched as they immediately went to talk to the groom, angrily pointing in my direction. The groom shrugged and continued to dance. The next morning I was approached by a different friend at breakfast (not in the wedding party) who stated that they heard what happened and that I should have left when asked because it made people \u201cuncomfortable\u201d and that I made it about me \u201cpartying\u201d rather than \u201crespecting wedding etiquette.\u201d I have felt incredibly embarrassed about this since\u2026.so am I the asshole for not leaving the wedding when asked?  TLDR: Wore yellow dress that looked white under black lights. Was asked to leave by a member of the wedding party. Didn\u2019t leave. Told I made others uncomfortable by a friend the next day. Edit: A link to a similar dress (this is not the dress I wore but similar-ish in style and color) https://www.joinparallel.io/product/6676817f58d5163f7b59ef21 Also the most controversial things seems to be the black light dance party at this wedding. It was the last hour or so and was just a way to have fun. It was not as weird or as tacky as people are making it out to be. ",

I\u2019m going on maternity leave next month and my friend has no idea how she is getting to and from work.

        "selftext": "Hello Reddit! I have just downloaded Reddit because my niece said I should post this story to the AITA board so here I am! I am not very good with technology so forgive me but I'll probably be messing this whole post up! \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02  So basically here's what happened. Me and my wife hired our babysitter who we've been going to for years, we have 2 sons and a daughter and we've been hiring her since my oldest son was a baby (though it was mostly her mom looking after the baby while she was 'helping' so we gave her a couple of dollars for that \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02). She's now 16 and can look after the kids all on her own and my oldest two love her! (My youngest is only 7 months so I'm not sure he really gets it yet \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02, but he seems relatively happy when he's with her).  This Friday my kids daycare has been closed for renovations and Daisy (our babysitter) has kindly offered to take care of them after school, from 3:30-6pm! I get home from work at 6 and my wife gets home at half 6, however, I got home early from work at half five, when I got home I found my wife yelling at Daisy while Daisy was just sobbing and apologizing, I asked my wife what was going on and all she did was just start yelling that Daisy had cost us a bunch of money, my first thought was that she'd broken something, but my wife wasn't telling me what it was. She told Daisy she wouldn't be paying her for her time and to get the f*ck out of our house and never come back or she'd call the police. Daisy then ran out crying and I left my wife to calm down while I comforted my kids (they were all crying in a different room while my wife yelled at Daisy). When everything had calmed down, I got the full story from my wife.  So here's what happened: My mother had been looking after the kids until 3:30 while we were at work. This was Daisy's first time looking after my youngest son, though we knew we could trust her with the babies since she looked after my daughter alone when she was a baby. Something important that you should know is that my youngest son has breath holding episodes, which occur when he gets frustrated or is in pain, and he will just hold his breath, to stop them you just have to blow on the baby or they will just snap out of it on their own, they're completely normal and relatively safe in babies, however, the episodes can sometimes cause passing out and blueness, and it's normal and he usually wakes up within a few seconds. To cut a long story short my mom forgot to tell Daisy what to do if that happens, and when my son passed out, Daisy panicked and called 911, and then my wife. My wife is now angry that Daisy called 911 for 'nothing' and has now wasted our money on an ambulance ride. Me and my wife are now arguing because I think Daisy did the right thing but my wife doesn't, yesterday we got into a heated argument, we both said some hurtful stuff and she is now staying with her mother for a few days while she 'thinks over my priorities in the relationship'.

Due to all of my diagnoses I am unable to drive anywhere, I can still bus places and take Ubers but being driven somewhere is sometimes the best option for me. Multiple doctors told my parents I would be unable to drive due to being slightly blind and having anxiety. As I\u2019m unable to hold a full time job I don\u2019t have heaps of money coming in so Ubers are usually a last resort.  yesterday I had asked my dad if he could pick me up as the bus I was supposed to take never came. When he went to pick me up he made a few comments saying it would be a lot easier if I could drive, and how I should learn to drive anyways despite that fact that doctors don\u2019t want me to as he hates having to pick me up all the time.  I replied that it\u2019s just what happens when you have a disabled child and it\u2019s something you have to put up with.  He took massive offence to that and told mum who thought I was being incredibly rude.  He picks me up once or twice a week at most. ",

        "selftext": "My gf and I live together. I am 29 and she is 26. We\u2019ve lived together for 6 months. I have been very busy at work and with life so yesterday I was really looking forward to cooking dinner for gf and I and relaxing. We had this planned all weekend. My gf is more of a social butterfly than I am so she had plans yesterday morning with her friends. She had brunch at 11 and I was planning on having dinner ready by 630. I expected her to have a few mimosas at breakfast but nothing too crazy. Maybe she\u2019d get home and take a nappy nap before dinner.  Basically brunch turned into going to one more bar after (around 1 PM). Whichhhh turned into more bars. Which basically became bar hopping all day. She was texting me insisting that she will be home in time for dinner but by the way she was talking I could tell she was drunk. I started making the pasta around 5 pm. Around 530 I saw on her snap story that she was doing shots at a bar in a completely different neighborhood of Chicago. I didn\u2019t want to be the boyfriend who nags so I let it go. I was getting seriously annoyed because I was thinking ohhh great she\u2019s gonna be hammered for our nice night we had planned.  At 630 she was not home yet. I saw on her location that she was now at a *different* bar from where they were taking shots at. I ate and asked my friends if they wanted to play PlayStation so I packed up the food, put it in the fridge and hopped on PlayStation with the boys.  Gf arrived home around 715 PM clearly drunk. She asked wtf I was doing and what about dinner. I said she was late, and dinner was done but it\u2019s In the fridge so she can heat some up if she wants. She apologized for being a little bit late but basically gave me a half assed laughing apology saying \u201cyou never know what to expect when the girl gang goes to brunch\u201d I said that\u2019s fine but I now have other plans. She called me rude and went to bed. We haven\u2019t talked much about it today but I can tell she is being passive aggressive so am I the asshole? Edit: oh and she also went and said my dinner didn\u2019t look very good so she door dashed Taco Bell  UPDATE: gf and I talked. We are okay for the most part. She did sincerely apologize and admitted to her fucking up. She said she wished I came when she invited me though after she learned it might be out longer than like 2 PM.  This started another issue or think we need to figure out in our relationship. She opened up and said she wished sometimes I was more outgoing and social. She wishes I wasn\u2019t fine with sitting around the apartment all the time. ",

        "selftext": "I (27F) hit one year sober (from alcohol) at the beginning of the year. This was a huge accomplishment for me. It was bigger to me than finishing college. I told my family that next time we were together for family dinner I had something to celebrate. This all happened at my mom\u2019s. The kids were playing and the adults were hanging out. I took the moment to share that I\u2019d reached 1 year sober and how good I felt about it.\u00a0 They went with \u201cOhh, that\u2019s what you were talking about\u201d and \u201cHas it been a year already?\u201d I am embarrassed to admit I hoped someone would say they\u2019re proud of me. My BIL Steve looked at my sister and they both said \u201cWell\u2026\u201d at the same time and she said \u201cSince we\u2019re all here, (Niece) just got into (a specific gymnastics thing). It\u2019s been a LONG road but she did it!\u201d Steve popped some wine they'd brought and started giving everyone glasses/cups. He made eye contact with me and his face fell. I had this gnawing feeling so got up from the table. I took a walk. I tried to get through the moment mentally so I could be present for my niece to celebrate her success. But when I got back to the house my sister asked me why I left without saying anything. I said I needed a minute to myself. She looked at me funny and said \u201cOkayyyy\u2026\u201d I said I\u2019d shared something I was very proud of and she bulldozed over it. My mom put her hand up and asked me what my news was. I said that I\u2019d told them. I hit one year sober. Mom said my generation always wanted praise for doing the bare minimum, that wasn\u2019t an accomplishment it was just what I needed to do, like graduating high school. I tried to make it through to dinner but found myself just not in the mood anymore. I decided to go home.\u00a0 **Here is the direct thing I am being called a butthead for:** Id brought a small berry chantilly cake (my favorite) to share after dinner. It was the thing I decided I earned. The kids had definitely seen it. On my way out I decided to take it home with me.\u00a0 I guess when they realized the cake wasn\u2019t in the garage fridge anymore, my sister called to ask me why I took it. I said I did because it was MY cake to celebrate MY accomplishment. She said, word for word \u201cAre you fucking serious? Oh my god Emma, GROW UP. You are such a fucking baby.\u201d My Mom later texted me directly to tell me how disappointed she was that I threw a tantrum because my niece got more attention than me. I don\u2019t think her read of what happened is right, but that is why I am asking you guys. Am I the asshole because I took home the cake in the end? Was that really childish of me, considering the kids saw it and then didn\u2019t get any? As I was putting on my shoes to leave, Steve found me and directly apologized and said that he was completely oblivious in the moment. I know he did not do anything to intentionally hurt me. **EDIT FOLLOW UP:** Hi everyone, I just wanted to follow up and say thank you to everyone for the responses. I have a lot to think about when I next go to therapy (today, actually) and work on. I do want to clear up a few things that I've seen come up a lot on the comments: I am not in AA. I'd tried AA before and it was not compatible for me. It works for a lot of people very well and I'm happy for you if it works for you. So, stuff about the steps and personal inventory are not relevant to me. It wasn't a party for my niece, it was just a family dinner. The cake *was mine* and wasn't brought *for* my niece. I didn't take it *because* I wanted to get back at them. I took it because it's my favorite cake and I wanted to eat it because it was my thing that I earned.   I don't know why they opened wine for my niece getting into the gymnastic program. But I also don't think it's my place to say anyone else has a drinking problem, and I'd prefer to have eyes on my own paper. :)",

        "selftext": "My mom never wanted a boy. She wanted girls. Apparently her dream was 4 daughters. But she had me (16m) first. I have seen photos and videos of the day I was born. She cried hysterically when they told her I was a boy. Then she refused to hold me. After we were cleaned up she cried about not using the name she had chosen and said she didn't know how to move on from it. All this was caught on camera. Eventually my paternal grandma took me and she was the person to hold me in photos and videos taken during the rest of our hospital stay. My paternal grandma was my sole parent figure for the first 8 years of my life. She took care of me and I spent so much time at her house. Sometimes I was there for weeks. Then she had a brain bleed and died. So I was left with a mom who wanted girls and not a boy and a dad who wanted to be a provider and nothing more. My mom had my sister Lily two years after me. So mom got her girl and Lily got all her attention. While I got grandma until I was 8 and then nobody.  My mom and Lily are super close and mom adores Lily. Lily got the bigger bedroom, she gets the gifts, she gets all her favorite snacks, she gets to do all the extra curricular activities she could ever want and her birthdays are huge parties with huge gifts. Christmas she gets at minimum? 25 gifts from mom alone. Mom typically gets me one... never anything I'd like or want but you know, thought that counts (which is zero). My mom's family don't act too interested in making up for my lack of parental love. And in the last couple of years mom and I have argued more and I give her a hard time. Dad's never around to give him one. But mom? If she wants to ignore me than she can hear how shitty it is and if she wants to treat my sister like a perfect angel then she can hear about it. Mom has mentioned how I ruined her dream of four daughters. We were at mom's parents house Friday and mom gushed about Lily doing good on a project and the scooter she got Lily to help her get around easier. She got Lily a custom helmet and a personalized lock for her scooter. She couldn't stop talking about it and I told her she really does love to shower her favorite in gifts and praise. My mom's family told me I should take it easier on her and said I should understand we had some little troubles because of mom's gender disappointment. I told them I don't owe her shit because she had gender disappointment and that I didn't ask to be born to a mom who only wanted daughters. They told me I lacked adult understanding and compassion.

        "selftext": "My wife (39f) and I (36f) have a daughter (technically my stepdaughter but I\u2019ve raised her since she was 5) (19f) from a previous relationship of my wife\u2019s (her father is not in the picture) who has come back home after her first year at uni. She\u2019s picked up a new (and problematic) issue since she was last home for an extended period of time, surrounding laundry. Basically, she has established a \u201cboundary\u201d where nobody is to touch her clothes. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s concerned something will go missing/get damaged, thinks it\u2019s just gross for us to go through her stuff, and is an adult who deserves privacy. All fine, we have 3 young children in our home (9f, 9f and 2m) so plenty of washing to keep us entertained. The issue is that she has a habit of monopolising washing facilities to the extent where we\u2019re effectively prevented from being able to get any other laundry done. For example, last weekend she put a wash in before work and hung it out on the line at around 11am. She then left for work (12pm-10pm) - her wash was dry within an hour, and obviously she wasn\u2019t going to be back all day. We had a few days worth of washing to get through, so my wife (her mum) took everything off the line and folded it. We got through 5 other loads that day. She was NOT happy when she got home, and said that she\u2019d been very clear that we weren\u2019t to touch her things. When we explained the situation above, she said it was \u201cfirst come, first served\u201d (not something we\u2019ve ever said) and that since the next day was due to be nice also, we should\u2019ve just waited to get through it the next day. That really pissed us off. We\u2019ve offered her a weekly laundry day, where we\u2019ll avoid using the machines so she can have freedom to do as she pleases on that day, but she said once a week won\u2019t cut it. Fair enough, but there are 5 other people in the house that need clean clothes/bedding/towels. Other than that all we can really suggest is that she keeps on top of her washing. If she\u2019s at home we\u2019ll ask her to clear her clothes from the machine/dryer/washing line as needed, but like any 19 year old she has a social life/work commitments and is often busy. She\u2019s upset because she says we\u2019re not respecting her boundaries, whereas we\u2019ve pointed out that while \u201cdon\u2019t move my clothes\u201d is objectively reasonable, it\u2019s not fair for her to do so at the inconvenience of everyone else in our home. Essentially the last conversation we had ended up with her in tears because we said as long as situations like Saturday keep occurring, we\u2019ll continue to move her stuff. Just FYI, we do fold her clothes carefully, and leave them in a basket in a communal living area so they\u2019re kept together, in good condition, and we\u2019re not going in and out of her room. We normally have a good relationship with her, so this is all a bit unusual. We\u2019ve asked her if everything else is okay, and she says yes and seems otherwise normal in and of herself, and she\u2019s normally reasonable so - are we being unreasonable? EDIT: So the consensus is pretty much that we\u2019re right, and our daughter is being massively unreasonable, and that we\u2019re being pushovers for not being tougher on her from the off. We\u2018ve shown her the comments, and unfortunately she\u2019s still insisting that we\u2019re the unreasonable ones. We\u2019d never considered the local laundromat, and have banned her from using our washing machine for the next fortnight given she\u2019s still unwilling to adjust. She\u2018a absolutely FURIOUS, and wife has ordered a lock for the washroom door to enforce the 2 week rule. Hopefully a couple of weeks hauling her stuff to and from will help her see the light. Thanks very much all!!   EDIT 2: A slightly calmer update this morning. Our daughter came to talk to us, and apologised for the situation. She said she had found the transition back home hard (I get that) and had maybe become a bit territorial over her stuff while at uni. All okay. She then asked if she could please have a laundry day, and be allowed to use the machine. Her place of work is closed Mondays, so that\u2019s now \u201cher\u201d day, and we\u2019ve said that she can use the machine on other days - but if by 7am Tuesday there\u2019s anything in the way (or any issues on any other days!) we\u2019ll be moving her stuff. A genuine sorry goes a long way with us, and while the advice has been to hold firm, we don\u2019t really want an issue if the situation can be resolved calmly. We\u2019ve also made it clear that if her things DO have to be moved on any day (other than Monday which is totally hers) and we get ANY grief about it, we\u2019ll go back to a 2 week ban and there\u2019s no going back.  Maybe a less satisfying update than the last one, but we\u2019re happy we can resolve the problem calmly. She did mention she\u2019d read through some of these comments last night, so thank you to everyone that weighed in.",

It was kind of a trunk or treat with little games the kids could play. Kinda cute.  While my kids were playing one of the games, someone asked me if I wanted to enter a drawing. Why not? So I did.  Well, I won. Because the universe wanted a laugh. It was for a perfect date night. This is the part where I mention that I'm divorcing my cheating husband and I'm not dating anyone and have no interest in dating anyone. The prize was a fire pit, a $50 gift certificate to an Italian restaurant, a $10 gift card to a florist, 2 Halloween themed plush blankets, a nice scented candle, a picture frame, and a box of hot chocolate.  The kids and I can enjoy an evening roasting marshmallows over the fire pit. They each got a cute blanket. We all enjoy hot chocolate. The Italian restaurant has a kids menu, so the three of us can go one night. Overall, it's a prize that I can enjoy with my kids.  One of my friends, also single, said I shouldn't have even entered and at least should have turned down the prize since it was meant for a couple and I'm happily unattached. She said it goes against the spirit of the drawing. So, reddit, AITA for keeping a date night prize to enjoy with my kids instead of a partner?  Editing in case it makes a difference in the judgment: the whole festival, including the drawing I won, was free. It was something for Kraft foods and some local businesses to promote themselves.",

        "selftext": "So my family is my dad, mom, my two sisters and my two brothers. I'm (17m) the oldest. My dad was estranged from his dad since he was my age. His mom died when he was 10. So we never knew grandma either. My dad was open about the fact grandpa wasn't a very nice man and all kinds of stuff. But he never went into details. I know he really did a number on dad because I still sometimes see dad look ashamed if he spills something or makes a mistake. I also know he tries to hold back any time he cries and looks downright disgusted with himself for crying. Three years ago his dad reached out and my mom and my sister (15) were SO excited and basically welcomed him into the family. Dad said no way. He and mom fought a lot about it. My siblings all told dad they had a right to know our grandfather and he should love his dad. I was dragged along at first and I stopped going. Dad has refused to have any part in it and he and mom fought because he told her his father was never going to step foot inside our house and if he did, then dad would leave and he would never come back. So mom takes my siblings to see him. Christmas was a huge fucking fight last year because they decided to spend it with this dude and my dad refused to go and so did I. My siblings started crying into dad's face that they wanted Christmas with him. Mom was calling him selfish. She tried to do the whole I'm your mother and you listen to me and dad told her he's my father and I could stay with him if I wanted to. They're still sour about it but then dad took me out for his birthday and didn't come home until late because he found out they were planning to take him out to meet with his father. My dad told my mom and my siblings since he cannot trust them with his birthday, he will only celebrate with the people he can trust now. I also heard him tell mom this couldn't continue and they needed to divorce. Now my mom is freaking out because she doesn't want the divorce and my siblings are really upset. They told me I should help since dad and I are still close. I told them they should learn to live with the consequences of their decisions. I pointed out to mom she was always big on us learning. I told them this is a big one. My mom told me my siblings are so young and don't deserve this. I told her it's all her fault because she undermined dad by making a point to demand he come in front of my siblings and so they think they can manipulate him and not listen. AITA?",

        "selftext": "So, my (26F) parents decided to name my sister and I after American states. I have permission to share her name (Arizona) and I was called Pennsylvania at birth. Yea, my parents are weird. I guess they thought geographical names were cool but I think there\u2019s a huge difference between calling your child Arizona or Dakota or Paris Vs Pennsylvania. They\u2019re massive republicans and America lovers so maybe they wanted to be patriotic.  For as long as I can remember, everyone has called me Penn or Penny. My parents insisted that everyone was to call me by my full name but most people could see how ridiculous my parents are.  My sister (28F) didn\u2019t struggle as much with her name since Arizona just sounds better than Pennsylvania, and the Greys anatomy character Arizona Robbins made the name seem quite cool as we got older. I was mocked and teased as a child in elementary school because of my parents insistence on my full name. They would literally berate my teachers for letting me write \u2018Penny\u2019 on my work/books. When I was 21, I got my name legally changed to Penelope. Most people I had met in college had assumed that I went by Penny as a nickname for Penelope, even my boyfriend\u2019s mother called me Penelope because I was too embarrassed to tell her that Penny was short for Pennsylvania. I kept it a secret from my parents and close family because I knew my parents would go mental and accuse me of disrespecting their choice. I\u2019m getting married this summer to my lovely boyfriend Tom (31M) and as you all know, you have to say your full name in your wedding ceremony when doing your vows. I knew I had to fess up about the name change because the alternative would be hoping they kept quiet when they heard me say \u2018I, Penelope\u2019 instead of \u2018I, Pennsylvania\u2019. I invited them over to my home and I tried to tell them in a really calm way that I had changed my name but they freaked out. They said that I was disrespectful, I was calling their choice dumb etc. They are refusing to attend the wedding now. I know i\u2019m not the AH for changing my name, but my parents are particularly pissed about how I kept it hidden for five years before telling them. Most people I know agree with them. They think that I should\u2019ve had the courage to be honest with them years ago so they would\u2019ve had time to get used to it instead of me dropping the news on them two months before my wedding and causing all this drama. A few other family members have dropped out and my poor sister (who is maid of honor) is having a nightmare with this. My parents believe they had the right to know much earlier. Tldr, parents think I am the AH for keeping this a secret. AITA? Edit: I know I could ask the officiant/priest to say Penny instead of Penelope but I don\u2019t want to hide my real name on my wedding day.",

        "selftext": "Edit: beofre I get a million put her into therapy comments, we tried twice. She would just sit there  For months even with different therapist she would not talk, she just sat there  So, I (42F) have two daughters: Emma (17F) and Lucy (10F). The issue revolves around my husband, who is Emma\u2019s stepfather. Emma\u2019s dad passed away when she was younger, and I remarried three years ago. She and my husband don\u2019t get along at all, and she makes it clear she dislikes him. My husband has tried to bond with her, but Emma shuts him out completely, refuses to talk, and ignores him. We all know she will never see him as a father figure and we are fine with it Here\u2019s where it gets tricky: when Emma was younger her bio dad would take her to  father-daughter outings. We have a lot of pictures of those, Lucy was too young to remember any of them. We thought it would be nice to do again, since Lucy does see her stepdad as her dad. Specifically they would go to a pumpkin patch and then carve them They went to the pumpkin patch yesterday and had a great time. Lucy and my husband really bonded and had a good time. The issue is Emma, she is pissed that he took over the tradition with lucy.  That my husband stole the tradition and I am disrespecting my late husband memory. I was exhausted from hearing the same arguments over and over. So, I snapped and said, \u201cYeah, I get it, you hate him, but your sister sees him as her dad and doesn\u2019t have these memories like you do. Are you really doing to ruin this for your sister and no one owns going to a pumpkin patch She has been pissed and calling me an insensitive jerk. She is also getting on Lucy\u2019s ass for going with my husband. My mom thinks I am an jerk here and I need an outside opinion ",

        "selftext": "Throwaway bc she knows my reddit. So, here's the deal. My (28M) girlfriend (27F) of two years and I planned a two-week vacation to Italy. I paid for the flights, hotels\u2014everything, because I make more than she does, and I wanted it to be a stress-free trip for both of us. Everything was great until the last day when she tells me she wants to stay longer to find herself and think about our relationship without me. She didn't discuss this with me beforehand, and it completely blindsided me. I was hurt and told her that if she feels she needs time alone, then she should also be independent financially during this extension of her trip. I said I wouldn\u2019t be paying for her new return ticket whenever she decides to come back. Now, she's upset, calling me unsupportive and selfish, and some of our friends are saying I'm being an a-hole because I left her stranded in a foreign country without financial help. So, Reddit, AITA for refusing to pay for her new plane ticket home after she chose to extend her trip without any heads-up?  Update: Thank you to all the people who responded, especially the early ones who gave some outside verification of me probably not being the asshole. I don't feel comfortable saying I'm completely blameless here because you're only getting one side of the story and I need to take responsibility for my part in this whole thing such as it is. But I guess I never realized how good my gf was at making me feel like unreasonable shit was normal and rational and that I was the crazy one.  So here's the update. We're both back in America now and she's packing her shit to go stay with her family for a bit until she can find a new place. Soon after I posted, it was time to go to the airport, so I did...without her. I'm one of those people who arrives really early because I never think I'll get to the gate in time because everything that could go wrong probably would go wrong (it never does but, especially with how I was feeling my luck was going, I didn't want to push it).  I was there for about an hour by myself mulling things over and talking to my mom. I looked at a couple responses to this post but I didn't trust that I wouldn't lose it if I started responding and I definitely didn't want to burst into tears while I was in the airport.  As I was talking to my mom, my gf showed up. I guess she thought I was bluffing but had a rude awakening when the hotel staff kicked her out of the room because I'd only paid through that day. I took no small amount of satisfaction in this, ngl. She'd been so concerned about the plane ticket that she didn't even stop to think about where she was going to stay... As many of you guessed, she met someone while we were in Italy. She was quick to tell me that it was just a physical attraction and that they hadn't done anything, but she had his @ and was wanting to see if it'd go anywhere. I guess that's what I get for not feeling well and wanting to stay in one night while she went out to explore... Obviously, I told her things were over between us. Even though she tried to make it sound like nothing had happened, the fact was a. I couldn't feel like I could trust her when she said that and b. I don't really want to be with someone who feels like it's okay to still keep her options open when she's been in a monogamous relationship for the past 2 years.  The flight home was awkward as fuck and she tried really hard to give another pitch for why we should stay together on the drive home from the airport. I think, as we got closer to home, reality started setting in and she realized she'd just thrown a lot away.  So yeah. I'm jetlagged and physically and emotionally exhausted. I'm just kind of numb at this point.  Finally, I didn't see all the comments (as there are 2.5k at the time of this update) but, to the few that were downvoted into oblivion who said this was fake because I hadn't updated in several hours...fuck you. I was looking for reasonable dissenting opinions that might have helped me make sense of this situation and you're accusing me of making this up for random internet points?? Believe it or not, my priority was not to tell a bunch of strangers on the internet how my world was falling apart around me. I know it's easy to think that these people aren't real and their struggles are meaningless because screens divide us but, ironically, you're the assholes. ",

        "selftext": "My BF [30M, RIP] and I [33M] were together for 15yrs. I was his Senior in Highsc, and we stayed together until a few months ago when he passed away due bone cancer. I live in a traditional country where same sex marriage is no legal but is not a big issue socially. His parents kicked him out when he came out as gay at 17, my family took him in, helped him to finish HS and were supportive the most they could. I work in HR and he worked in IT, since he started to work he made good money. He saved enough to purchase a house 10yrs ago, he was paying the mortgage all by himself. 4yrs ago he got the diagnosis. He reduced his working hours to take care of his health and I stepped in to pay the mortgage. It was a hard battle, but cancer took him back in March. After he passed away, his family appeared in the picture, saying how they regretted not being in his son's life and stuff. Time went by and a month ago they reached out to me asking me when they can expect I could give them the keys of the house. Since same-sex marriage is no legal, they could claim the house as their family. I told them that the house was in my name, I bought it from him a year into the cancer, so it was legally mine and I had been paying the mortgage way before it. They got upset and said I was being unreasonable, that it should be legally theirs, that my **BF would have wanted to give them the house**, which is in fact true, my bf talked a lot how he would give everything to them if that would fix the relationship between them. Actually, he bought the house as a way to bring them live with him so they would no longer rent; he also tried to make amends with them all this time, unsuccessfully. I told them that I would give them the house for the price I bought it from my BF and they would have to pay me back these 4 years of mortgage + take the debt over their name. They said they didn't have the money and that it was so selfish of me to tell them that, knowing what my BF would have wanted. They proposed just to change the debt onto their name and give me no money in return, I declined. They got mad and the discussion got heated to the point they told me they would bring me to court accusing me of scamming my BF to have the house (they can\u2019t). They have been calling and texting me non-stop for the past month, telling me I would be an asshole to my bf if I don't give them the house. I know they can't pay me back all the money I put in the house, but I'm conflicted right now. Some friends told me that I should give them the house and move on with my life, but it just doesn't feel right to me. I'm leaning more onto not giving them the house, but I know my BF would jump the bed and give it to them. Right now their words feels empty and as if they just want to take advantage of the situation. I don't need the house, to be honest, but don't want to give them either. We never talked with my bf what should I do with the house after his death, so WIBTA if I don't give them the house? ETA: Thank you, thank you all for your kind words. I cried a lot with most of the comments. Sorry If I can't keep the pace and reply to everyone, just wanted to say thank you from the bottom of my heart. ETA2: This blown up in ways I didn't even think about. Thank you all for your kind words. Just to add some info that looks like is needed for some of you: I live in a country in Central America, for safety reason will not give the name. Here is not illegal being LGBTQ+, but same sex marriage is just not legal, nothing more. We didn't live in the house, we lived at my apartment, that's why I don't need the house, but I just don't feel right to giving it to his parents. Also, almost all his money went to pay medical bills, he didn't want me to put my money on it (which obviously I would have) and buying the house was the best idea we came out with to satisfy the both of us. The house is not a big one (6mts x 10mts) and also is in the suburbs, is not worth the same as in other countries, around USD$90k or a little more. He was such a kind heart, so I'm pretty sure that even if it was a lie, he would have given them the house the moment they acknowledge him as gay and tell him they loved him. That's the reason why I'm having a hard time considering this. I can't answer all your comments, but I'm trying to read you all. Thank you for your support.",

        "selftext": "I'm moving to another city for work. Since I'm an adult and not a college kid I hired movers.  My parents insisted on coming down to help me pack up. I live in their basement suite. It was cheap and they let me have my privacy. They brought my brother and my nephew. The four of them were as helpful as a bag of used horse condoms. Especially my nephew.  My parents decided to keep him busy by giving him one of my Lego sets to play with. I collect them. What I usually do is buy two of the same one. I build one, put it up for display and leave the other one in the box to trade or sell.  He took it upstairs to stay out of the way then he took it home. All I noticed is that he was out from under foot.  The next day I saw the box on the garbage. I didn't assume. I knew the answer already but I didn't assume. I went upstairs to talk to them. I asked where the Lego box came from. They said they gave it to Travis to keep him busy. I told them that they needed to replace it. They said I was being childish for caring so much about a toy. I said they could replace it or I would file an insurance claim and that would probably require a police report.  My dad got angry. He pulled out $70 and told me I was an asshole for making a fuss over a toy. I asked him if that was a down payment? He said that is what he spent on the last Lego gift he got me for Christmas and that is what those helmets cost.  I showed him the box. I told him to keep his money. He just had to give me a sealed box like the one he stole.  He said he didn't steal anything. He took the box and went to the Lego store nearby.  When he came back he was apologetic. He said he would get it back from my nephew. I said I wanted a sealed box with the Tie Fighter helmet. I even went on eBay to help him find one cheaper than he had found by himself at the collectibles store the guy at the Lego store sent him to. With shipping it would only be $300. He ordered it. He isn't happy about it.  My mom is upset that I'm expecting that much money for a toy. My dad is upset that I didn't explain before he went and made a fool of himself at the store. I'm upset that they stole from me.  AITA?",

        "selftext": "(It\u2019s NOT a dollhouse, but I didn\u2019t want anyone to think I was being misleading on purpose by saying I built a house) I (28M) made my wife (28f) a replica of a house that\u2019s known to fans of a musician, but wouldn\u2019t mean much to others. It\u2019s about 2 feet tall and wasn\u2019t very complicated to build, but my wife had said a few times over last year that she thought it would be cool to have for little trinkets. She\u2019s like a crow with her trinkets, I love it. She didn\u2019t know I was making it for her, but I did sneakily involve her in its creation through having her make a couple Tiktoks when we were out together so I could get the colors right. She has no idea, lol.\u00a0 I was excited, so I showed a picture to my brother. He told me it was cool, but didn\u2019t get the purpose. He showed it to my niece Ava (13f) who knew what it was and said she wanted one too. My brother asked if I would give it to Ava for her birthday. I said no, it\u2019s for my wife, but I could make one with Ava. It would help teach her some basic woodworking skills which they don\u2019t do in schools here anymore. I\u2019d like that. Brother said if it was so easy then I could make a second one for my wife and just give this one to Ava since her bday is the end of the month. Again I said no, this was done specifically for my wife. He seemed to accept that but then came back to me and said \u201cIsn\u2019t it a little weird to make a dollhouse for an adult woman?\u201d I told him it\u2019s not a dollhouse, just a fancy shelf. He argued that makes it worse, because Ava would actually \u201cplay\u201d with it. He must have gone to complain to mom about it (he is the younger brother) because mom called me to tell me that it was \u201cstupid\u201d to give my wife a dollhouse. I tried to explain that it\u2019s not a dollhouse but she just kept saying \u201cthat\u2019s stupid.\u201d\u00a0 This weekend I was at their house and Ava kept bringing up the house and laying it on thick with statements like \u201cI\u2019ve alway wanted one just like it.\u201d She kept asking why my wife wanted a dollhouse. I said it\u2019s not a dollhouse, but she kept asking why she needed a dollhouse. I told my brother that he was encouraging his kid to be manipulative and I really didn\u2019t like it, so I was going to leave. He told me that I was dangling the house over her head like McDonald\u2019s and teasing her and that it made me a bad uncle. Being a good uncle is important to me and I do feel for the girl because she\u2019s a big fan too. I admit I have a blind spot for this because I don\u2019t have kids and maybe I shouldn\u2019t have shared the picture with my brother to begin with. Am I really the asshole for not just giving it to her? Yes, it WAS easy to make and I COULD make another quickly. **Sorry guys Ava isn't my brother's biological daughter, there's a long story involved that I didn't want to add but I should've realized the age would be surprising.** I still see her as my niece regardless but I get why that would be alarming.

        "selftext": "I (38M) got engaged to my fiance (37F) about 3 months ago.  We've been dating for almost 3 years.  She has 2 kids from a previous relationship (15F & 12M).  Their dad is involved in their lives and for the most part the adults all co-parent and communicate well.  I get along really well with the 12-year-old, but I have always struggled to build a relationship with my soon-to-be step daughter, Riley.  She has made it very clear to me, my fiance, and her bio-dad that she doesn't view me as a parent and doesn't want me to try and be a father to her because she already has one.   A few days ago, my fiance sent me a text asking me if I could pick up Riley from school because she had something come up at work that was going to keep her late.  My fiance usually picks up Riley once a week and brings her to a chiropractic appointment to help with a sports injury Riley got. She told me she would call the school to let them know that I would be picking Riley up because I wasn't on the approved pick-up list yet.   However, when I got to Riley's school, it quickly became apparent that my fiance forgot to call the school.  The school has locked doors that require you to have a code or be buzzed in by the office.  I buzzed into the office to let them know I was there to pick up Riley and that my fiance should have called to let them know. They didn't know anything about it.  I was left waiting outside for 5-10 minutes while they figured it out.  I tried calling and texting my fiance but she didn't answer.  Then, the school resource officer (an actual uniformed cop) came out and told me that I would have to leave and that if I refused then he would arrest me for trespassing.  I tried talking with him but he just kept saying I was not authorized to be on school property and that I had to leave.   I had no choice but to leave without Riley.  Finally, an hour later, my fiance called me back.  I explained what happened and she apologized for forgetting to call the school because she got distracted with work.  She told me she would figure it out and meet me at home.   When she and Riley got home, Riley went straight to her room.  My fiance sat me down and told me that Riley had lied to the office and told them that she didn't know who I was and had never seen me before.  She thought it would be funny.  She told me she explained to Riley how dangerous that was and was going to work with Riley's dad to figure out a punishment. Needless to say, I did not take that news well.  I admit I did raise my voice to her.  I didn't yell, but I did get louder than I usually talk.  She told me to calm down and I told her that I won't calm down because her daughter almost got me arrested because she thought it would be funny.  I told her that she's just as responsible for this as Riley is because she didn't call the school and it put me in a position where I looked like a creep or predator.   My fiance thinks I am overreacting and that I need to let her and Riley's dad handle this.",

I wouldn\u2019t mind so much if it wasn\u2019t for the fact that every time she\u2019s here, she helps herself to my stuff\u2014mainly my food. I meal prep for the week, and I buy my own groceries. It\u2019s not like I don\u2019t share sometimes, but I\u2019ve noticed that after every weekend she\u2019s here, a bunch of my food is gone. Snacks, leftovers, even stuff like my eggs and bread\u2014just gone. I\u2019ve tried hinting at it, like casually mentioning how much food I go through, but it keeps happening. Last weekend, I had a really long week at work, so I treated myself to some nice takeout and planned to save half of it for lunch the next day. The next morning, I open the fridge, and it\u2019s gone. I texted my roommate, and he said, \u201cOh, my girlfriend was hungry, so she ate it. Sorry, man.\u201d That was the last straw. I told him we needed to talk and said that while I\u2019m okay with her visiting sometimes, she can\u2019t keep staying over every weekend and eating my food. I told him it\u2019s not fair, especially since she\u2019s not contributing to groceries or utilities. He got defensive, saying that since he pays rent, she should be able to stay over whenever, and I\u2019m making a big deal out of \u201cjust a few snacks.\u201d I stood my ground and told him she needs to stop coming over so often unless they start buying their own food and being more considerate. Now, he\u2019s pissed at me, and I\u2019m getting the cold shoulder. AITA for putting my foot down after his girlfriend kept eating all my food?",

My younger sister (13) has a host of food allergies and some of them are very serious and she's also on the spectrum. Then we have my younger brother (11) and he has a lot of medical issues related to food and allergies that go along with it. We always try to make sure places are accessible for them. Especially because my older sister is in a wheelchair. This does mean I can be overlooked. It does mean making sacrifices or accepting that things will never be as far as it would be for a kid in a family with less extra/special needs. I'm used to not getting my favorite dishes and I'm used to not getting my top pick for vacations because my parents don't think it's accessible enough or autism friendly enough. I'm used to my siblings never getting turned down for that stuff. After a while it became something I expected. I was lucky that my maternal grandparents tried to make up for it when they could and my best friends family would also include me in their family for stuff like meals out. My favorite restaurant in our city is this Indian place. My favorite dish is their samosas. I never get to eat there with my parents and siblings and we never get takeout from there because it's not deemed safe for all my siblings. Sometimes that stinks, especially when my parents proclaim they always get their kids favorite food from their favorite restaurant for their birthdays each year. This year my parents made a big deal over me turning 16 and they told me to pick my favorite place for us to have a family dinner for my birthday. A family dinner that included extended family. I told them my favorite place and they told me that wouldn't work. I asked if they wanted my favorite place or a place catered to my siblings. They asked me if I didn't want to cater to my siblings and I said no. They asked where did I want to go, I said the Indian place. They gave me one of those looks and said they would give me more time to think. A couple of weeks after they asked me where I wanted to eat for my birthday and I told them my answer had not changed. They asked me if I could really enjoy my birthday knowing it wasn't accessible and safe for my siblings to eat there and I said yes, since it's meant to be my birthday and they wanted me to say my favorite restaurant. They told me they would book the family favorite and went ahead and did that. The family favorite has nothing I actually like, I just tolerate it. They had everything planned, invited everyone and when the evening came for the dinner I just didn't go. My parents are furious with me. I had everything taken for a week and they plan to continue the punishment in some way. My grandparents defended me but my parents said I was rude. AITA?",

        "selftext": "My daughter, Jenny, (13) has a best friend, Morgan (nearly 13). The two of them spend a lot of time together at our place. I do not know Morgan\u2019s mother very well as Jenny doesn\u2019t often go to their house. This is mainly because Morgan\u2019s house is a little chaotic. She has 4 siblings. Jenny is an only child and Morgan has said she likes the quiet. Morgan has done a lot of stuff with us. I occasionally enter radio/online competitions and will win tickets to certain local events. When I won 4 tickets to a concert last year, Jenny and I brought Morgan along with one other friend. We all had a blast. Recently, I won another pair of tickets to a concert that I planned to attend with Jenny. A few days after, I was told about a work trip that I have to take that falls that weekend. Jenny usually comes with me. So, Jenny suggested we give the tickets to Morgan for her birthday. She could either go with another friend or her mom. I checked with Morgan\u2019s mom before we mentioned this to Morgan and she said that was fine. Last night, Morgan was at our house and she seemed upset. When I asked why, she said her mom was taking her brother to the concert because \u201cher brother has never been to a concert before\u201d. I asked if Morgan\u2019s brother even liked the band and Morgan said no, it was just the principle of the matter. Morgan and her other 3 siblings have been to concerts. He hasn\u2019t and since they can\u2019t afford stuff like this, he gets to go. I found this unfair and honestly a waste of tickets. I called Morgan\u2019s mom to double check this story and she confirmed it all, including her 11 year old son barely knowing anything about the band. I said I\u2019m sorry, but I don\u2019t feel right giving these as a birthday gift anymore as these were for Morgan. I said we\u2019d give them to Jenny and Morgan\u2019s other friend who I know likes the band, and we\u2019ll get Morgan something else for her birthday. Morgan is fine with this. Morgan\u2019s mom is pissed and says I\u2019m trying to tell her how to parent. I don\u2019t think I am because if a different friend gave Morgan the tickets and it was the same result, as shitty as I\u2019d find her mom doing this, I wouldn\u2019t say anything as that\u2019s not my business. As I am giving the tickets, I want them to go to Morgan. I\u2019d also maybe feel different if the brother loved the band too but as he doesn\u2019t, I don\u2019t want to give them.  So here I am left wondering if I\u2019m being an ass here?",

        "selftext": "My (F41) son (M20) has been in a relationship with his girlfriend, Lily (F20), for about three years now. I love my son and I hate to say this, but he\u2019s not turned out to be a good person. He has very little work ethic, has no desire to get a job or go to college, and spends most of his time gaming or partying. Lily on the other hand, is the polar opposite. She\u2019s very studious, has aspirations to be a doctor, is a very good swimmer, and is currently away at college. When my son and Lily first got together in high school, they were an excellent match. We loved having Lily over and my son definitely took more care of himself. Since then, it\u2019s rapidly deteriorated. I know my son still loves Lily, but he never gives her the attention she deserves and with her clear potential, I just feel she deserves better. When Lily came to visit a few days ago, she was visibly upset. When my son went to the store, I asked her if she was okay, and she told me that she didn\u2019t know what to do and wondered why my son had such little ambition and was so lazy. I told her I didn\u2019t see it changing anytime soon (as that\u2019s my view given it\u2019s been ongoing for almost two years); when she asked what I would do in her situation, I told her to put herself first and what she wanted. Lily thanked me and said she\u2019d think about things. Well earlier today, my son comes downstairs in a rage telling me that Lily had broken up with him via text. I asked him what she said and apparently the message referred to \u201cdiscussions with your mom\u201d that had made her rethink the relationship. My son was livid that I\u2019d gotten involved and said I\u2019d overstepped boundaries. I told him that I didn\u2019t advise Lily to leave him, just said she had to make her own choices and decide what was best for her. My son is now not talking to me and my husband is annoyed believing that having no Lily will make my son\u2019s rut last even longer. I also miss having Lily around. So, AITA?",

        "selftext": "Throwaway because my sister knows my reddit and I don't want this causing drama Yesterday, My sister hosted a family dinner at her house. It was one of those just because dinners, no special occasion. My sister is a great cook and she made tons of food for that one night. My daughter, was on her second plate by the end of the night. Once she finished she asked if she could get another one. I said yes. But my sister (her aunt) looked at her with a shocked expression and said Another plate?. My daughter turned around and gave a somewhat un comfortable look. My daughter is 16, and has 2 part time jobs to pay for some of her college tuition, so she usually doesn't eat until 7-8pm. So I didn't even blink twice when she got up to grab her 3rd plate. I turned to my sister and said she's been working all day without anything to eat, you made tons of food, it won't hurt for her to get another plate. My sister started yelling saying something about how it wasn't my place to say if my daughter could get more of her food that she made. Now I do somewhat agree with that, and might be the A-hole because of that. Looking back I'm thinking maybe I should have asked?  My daughter ended up not getting another plate, and the vibe was awkward now so we just decided to go. Before we left out the door my sister stopped me and told me I should've taught my daughter manners and how it isn't right to get more than 1 plate at someone else's house. I told my sister she was being ridiculous and somehow our voices got loud enough where my mom started to hear us in the small corner, she came over and started telling me she agreed with my sister and it was rude for my daughter to eat that many plates. I started to get fed up when they began telling me I wasn't teaching her proper manners, so I left. Then of course they began texting my phone saying how it was rude to leave in the middle of our conversation. I don't think I was the A-hole at all for leaving because I wasn't going to stay in a place where I felt disrespected. But i'm not sure about the plate thing.  So am I the A-hole for assuming my daughter could get another plate?",

Celebrating Father's Day or my birthday, I don't like attention on me and prefer to keep things low key whenever I can. So, keeping that in mind, I was diagnosed with an extremely curable type of skin cancer. It was caught very early on and I never felt scared for my life in any way, shape or form. I'm an engineer and I think analytically and wasn't scared with a diagnosis with a 0.03% fatality rate. Still, I told my wife of course, and she was terrified. We talked through it and told her my doctor was very optimistic and said we have caught it early on, etc. None of it seemed to help, but I tried. After a while, I told her that we shouldn't tell our kids, 5F and 7F. My wife wanted to tell them, but I was adamant about that, I'm not even sure they would understand what we're talking about. Reluctantly, she agreed not to. About a week later, I get a call from my dad.....asking about my cancer. Turns out, my wife posted on FB about my cancer that morning. I called her and wasn't happy that she posted my business and his behind the You didn't say I couldn't post it, just not to tell the kids excuse. There is no way she would think I wanted that posted online, no matter what I said. So, she took it down and time went by. Very quickly, I was in remission with my skin cancer and my doctor told me, word for word, We don't like to say you're 'cured', but, you're cured. I told my wife and she was ecstatic. She told me she was worried all this time (I could tell) and glad we put this all behind us. I thought we could put this all behind us too.... This weekend, I'm coming home on Friday. I see a lot of cars parked on the street, some in my driveway. I couldn't think of any birthdays or anniversaries I missed, but went in anyway...... It was a party for my remission diagnosis. I was mortified at this, she's never done anything like this and we've talked about how I would hate a surprise party multiple times. I asked what this is for a said I'm sorry, but I didn't know you planned this, I'm just coming back for some files and heading back to work. It was a lie, I gathered up some meaningless files in my office and said thanks to everyone for coming and left to go back to my office, messing around on my phone until everyone left. My wife knew I was lying and we fought that night and I told her I don't know what's gotten into her, but she knows I would never want this and she doesn't get to make a big deal out of something personal I never wanted to be public in the first place. We've been cold this whole week and my brother said I'm TA since I told him I just pretended to go to work. So, AITA for not wanting to celebrate beating my cancer?",

        "selftext": "---UPDATE  AT BOTTOM--- I'll try to keep it short. My wife and I have three boys, 17, 16, and 14. May the lord have mercy on my soul. Actually they are good guys. I was at Target with my youngest, Tanner. We split for a while and he shows back up asking if he could buy something with his own money. It was a beard trimmer. I laughed and told him he didn't need that yet. He explained nope, not for his face, he wanted it for downstairs.\u00a0 His older brothers both manscape and he wanted to as well. But they wouldn't loan their trimmers. I told him sure, I'd even buy it for him. Got home and wife was not impressed. She didn't want him to have it. One excuse after the other. ***He's not old enough.*** Sure he is. ***He didn't need it yet.*** Ok true he's not exactly taming a jungle, more like a small hedge, but if he wants to neaten things up that's fine by me. ***I don't want more hair all over their bathroom.*** Non-issue. The boys keep their bathroom clean. While me, Tanner, and the oldest Liam are pretty smooth, middle boy Lucas somehow\u00a0got the gorilla gene (he was Sasquatch at 14). If he's not causing a problem, no one will. I told him he could keep the trimmer but wife seems pursed. I did remind him to keep the bathroom free of little hairs... get brothers to help/advise if needed, or me... and don't make the mistake of going all Kojak below the belt, Liam made that mistake a couple of years ago. With much itching. So AITA for disregarding my wife's opinion?   UPDATE -- Thanks everyone. I'm overwhelmed by all the comments, I only expected a few views/responses.\u00a0 I appreciate all who commented. I read them all even if I could not reply back to each.' All's good here. Last night I talked with my wife, as many theorized she is just wistful that the last baby bird is growing up (although all are still in the nest). She knows none of them will be little boys forever but she was (and is) such a good boy mom that she's missing those times already... and had a not-so-great reaction. That's ALL there is to it. Thankfully. As for Tanner, I went up to the oldest's\u00a0room\u00a0where all three were hanging out (you never know where the posse of hooligans will be). Tanner said Check it out! stood up and dropped his shorts in a flash.. and yep, the hedge clippers had been at work. I told him great job, looks good. He said Liam had to do most of it. Liam shrugged.\u00a0 I'm very blessed that they all get along so well and that the older two are excellent big brothers (MOST of the time). To a couple of ppl who DM'ed me, no none of us are nudists or anything like that LOL but they are definitely those never-wear-shirts guys, and when getting ready to go out you never know which one or ONES will be in the shower. The guys are just self assured (maybe too much), and not a shy bone in their bodies. Years ago TWICE my oldest (who had long hair then) went as Tarzan for Halloween. And my middle boy once went to a neighborhood costume contest as Michael Phelps in nothing but a Speedo and eight gold medals around his neck (and this was years after Phelps won).\u00a0 They keep me young and make me very tired at the same time. Thanks everyone!",

I saw a child licking her fingers, eating the sauce off them, and then proceeding to wipe them on the sauce dispensers (where the sauce comes out), repeating the same thing several times with all three sauce dispensers. I decided not to confront the child or say anything to her family to avoid causing drama and embarrassing the child. Instead, I told the staff about the incident. A staff member came out and asked who did it, and I pointed at the child. Probably should\u2019ve kept quiet, but oh well. The staff member confronted the family, which was a big group with two women and their children of various ages. The child who did this was about 6-7 years old (I saw her licking everything around her and even her mother asked her to stop). The family then confronted me, asking why I didn\u2019t tell them directly and went straight to the staff. I politely explained that my concern was food safety and that\u2019s all, so I wasn\u2019t looking to confront anyone. They didn\u2019t believe me, said I must hate children, and spent the next few minutes talking over me and not letting me put a word in. I reiterated that my concern was only food safety and that I don\u2019t want other people\u2019s saliva in my sauces. The staff member then told them they could easily check the CCTV, which seemed to calm the family down. I\u2019m still frustrated due to the whole incident.

        "selftext": "Edit:  I used to read all those posts where people said they didn't expect this to blow up. Well I thought I'd get like a dozen answers. But almost 2 million views in 24 hours is crazy lol. Many people are wondering why I'm insisting on a window seat. I like to look out but mainly if I need a nap that is unlikely to happen if I can't rest my head against the window. Other than that I hate aisle seats a lot, equally if not more than middle seats. People and the drinks trolley keep bumping into you. I don't understand why anyone would choose to sit there. It takes the trolley bumping into you once to change your mind.  Original post: So basically I (29M) boarded my short flight (70 min) which has a 2-2 seating arrangement. I had booked myself a window seat and when I got there I saw a maybe 7 year old boy sitting in there, next to his father (about 50 y/o) in the aisle seat. The opposite row also had his mother and his sister sitting there. Although this happened less than 24h ago I was exhausted so I don't remember the conversation word for word.  I pointed towards my seat and the father asked me if I would mind swapping so they could sit together, and that their seat is in the row behind it. I said that I would only swap if it is a window seat, and he said it is an aisle seat. Then I said I wouldn't swap and the following conversation happened  - Him: So do you want to sit next to my son?- Me: I don't care I just want the window seat.- Him: *standing up and getting his son up* you are a very nice person. I mean not a very nice person- Me: It's none of your business and be polite.- Him: I am not (referring to polite)- Me: (I said something I don't remember) and behave yourself. I just stood there looking at him serious, I think he was trying to shame me initially but he didn't respond anything else to that. His wife was watching this the whole time. When somebody in the row behind saw it he offered to swap and sat next to me so they did eventually sit next to each other. For all I care they could have sat 20 rows apart or even booked a new flight, I had zero investment in this or their reasons. They can ask, I can say no and that should be the end of it imo.  I didn't like they basically pulled a fait accompli when trying to swap with me. If they care that much they can book their seats in advance like everyone else. I didn't have a good reason why I *need* the window seat except that I like it and don't like the aisle seat lol.  ",

        "selftext": "I(32F) am a single mother of two kids (6M and 5m F). I am a single mother by choice (my kids are donor conceived). I am lucky enough to have a good job (French teacher in a private school), and a paid off house (parents\u2019 life insurance and inheritance). Before I had either of my kids, I made sure to have a year\u2019s living expenses saved, then I would take a sabbatical to recover from birth, as well as bond with my kids. While on sabbatical, I still tutor some kids for some extra income. My friend (34F), just had a baby 2 months ago. She is the breadwinner in her household, and her husband has been unemployed since he was laid off during COVID. It was great to be pregnant at the same time, as well as having a friend with a newborn. But it has turned sour. She has been saying how jealous she is of me being able to take off a whole year from work, how she would have loved to not worry about losing their home, how she doesn\u2019t even have a couple hundred dollars in her savings account, let alone a whole year\u2019s worth of living expenses\u2026. I usually ignore it, or brush it off, because I kind of can understand the stress she is under. Well, starting about 10 days ago, she started hinting at not being able to afford daycare, and any mention of her husband taking care of their kid is brushed off. Then she started remarking on how much free time I must have, which I deflected by saying -truthfully- that being a single mom to a baby and a small kid left me no free time actually. Then last night she came out with it, and asked if I could \u201cdo her a favor\u201d and watch her kid while she\u2019s at work. I was firm, but polite, when I said that I couldn\u2019t, that I am not capable of watching two kids under 6 months. She started almost begging me, saying she can\u2019t afford daycare, and if she is not back at work, she will lose her job, and they will end up homeless. I again brought up her husband, and she said that he was not good with kids, and isn\u2019t capable of taking care of her kid. I kept saying no, she kept pushing, until it escalated to her calling me heartless, and me telling her that it\u2019s not my problem she chose to have a kid with a useless man. Now she blocked me, I am feeling very guilty about what I said, and feeling like an AH.",

        "selftext": "My ex and I parted ways back in 2023. Ever since it happened, the communication with him and his family has been rocky. He was not interested in providing for our child (6) and I had to apply for child maintenance. He's in debt with them (circa \u00a31.3k), and has only paid about \u00a3120 in total. I've not been on good terms with his parents (Amongst other things, they asked me not to apply for child maintenance etc., as their boy cannot afford it, and so on, so you could say we're not the best of friends).  Here's where the problem started- they recently found out about quite a few concerts I'm planning to go to- yes I'd posted about it on SM, but they have no access to my accounts, I don't know how exactly they found that info). Recently, during child drop off, my ex's mother got very upset about the concert mumbo-jumbo and started telling me off for making my ex pay child support I just waste on myself and so on. I couldn't hold it in and just started laughing, which aggravated her even more. When she stopped ranting, and I stopped giggling, I told her, that her son's child support wouldn't even cover the travel cost of the trip, and they can rest assured that I don't live off of his child support given, that I wouldn't be able to raise my child on that amount, let alone the both of us. I should've stopped there, but I also added that so far we've received approximately \u00a310/month [note: I said that without doing the math, truthfully it's \u00a311.09 LOL), which doesn't even cover the cost of fruit my child eats, so neither of them has any say in how I spend MY own money (Note: I'm not sure if it matters, but yes, I work full time, so I spend my earnt money). She called me a liar and stormed off. Now their whole family are upset with me, saying that I was rude and they expect apologies. I was also told that I was an asshole for telling them how much I actually receive as it's put my ex in a bad light. My friends are divided too- some found the situation hilarious and others say that while it was fair to stand up for myself, I shouldn't have told her how much I get in ChM. In my defence- I had no idea it was such a big secret, I genuinely assumed she just didn't care about the amount, and just focused on the idea of me getting any money from them). Also, it's worth noting: My child didn't witness this interaction, she was already indoors, I'm sure it would've gone differently (I would've stopped the rant sooner) with the kid present. So, AITA for laughing and telling her how much ChM I've been receiving?",

I don\u2019t mind anyone sitting next to me, but the bus is never close to full, so I use the space for my bag.  Yesterday during my commute, a lady got on the bus and grimaced at me. She gestured for me to remove my bag so she could sit next to me. As usual, there were so many empty seats. I wasn\u2019t sitting in a disabled/reserved area \u2014 there were seats closer to the door. But whatever, I\u2019m not confrontational, I removed my bag so she could sit.  I sort of rolled my eyes when she sat down next to me and sighed, not to be obvious, but just because I got off an 8 hour shift, I was tired and wanted my own space, and SHE DIDNT HAVE TO SIT NEXT TO ME. She clearly noticed - she then said \u201cYou need to learn some manners.\u201d  After that I got up and moved to another seat, but the whole thing has been bothering me for a day. Did I really lack manners? It just feels like she sat there to teach me a lesson when she could\u2019ve sat anywhere else\u2026 ",

When she asked me to be her Maid of Honor, I was thrilled and went all out to make her wedding special. I paid for the bridal shower, bachelorette party (a weekend trip), decorations, and other expenses, spending several thousand dollars. While it was a lot of money for my husband and me, I wanted to make her big day perfect because she\u2019s like family to me. Two months ago, I shared that I\u2019m 4 months pregnant. Claire congratulated me but started acting distant afterward. She excluded me from conversations about the wedding and made passive comments about how \u201chard it is to coordinate\u201d when people are \u201cdistracted.\u201d I brushed it off, thinking it was wedding stress. A few days ago, she sat me down and told me she didn\u2019t want me in the wedding anymore. Her reason? I\u2019m \u201cgetting too fat,\u201d and she doesn\u2019t want me in the pictures. She said she has a specific \u201cvision\u201d for her wedding, and I no longer fit it. I was devastated. I asked if this was about my pregnancy, but she insisted it wasn\u2019t personal. She said she was replacing me as MOH with another friend who fit her \u201caesthetic.\u201d I told her if I wasn\u2019t in the wedding, I wouldn\u2019t attend at all. I also handed her the receipts for everything I\u2019d paid for and told her she or her fianc\u00e9 needed to reimburse me since I\u2019d only spent that money as her MOH. Claire flipped out, calling me selfish and accusing me of trying to ruin her wedding. She said it was \u201ctacky\u201d to ask for the money back and that expenses like these were \u201cmy responsibility as MOH.\u201d I reminded her that she removed me from that role, so those expenses were no longer mine. Since then, Claire, her fianc\u00e9, and even her family have been spamming me with calls and texts. They\u2019re accusing me of being petty and overreacting because of \u201cpregnancy hormones.\u201d They\u2019re also saying I should\u2019ve just let it go and written off the money because weddings are stressful, and Claire didn\u2019t mean to hurt me. My husband has been incredibly supportive and says I did the right thing. He\u2019s furious at how Claire treated me and agrees that I shouldn\u2019t be out thousands of dollars for a wedding I\u2019m not part of. I feel heartbroken and humiliated by someone I thought was my best friend. Still, the constant backlash has made me second-guess myself. AITA for standing up for myself and asking for reimbursement?

They live in a multi-million dollar house and his wife is decked out in designer clothes and has a face full of procedures. I told them no and they have been pressing me to waive my alimony payments. They've even made my daughters bring it up. He's called me coldhearted and said he had been good to me and would have helped me out if I was going through a hard time. AITA?

He is a good friend and we do hang out on occasion but see each other on all major holidays because of our parents.  We are in our early 20s. The problem started because of a dumb childhood memory. When we were 8, we had a wedding play on school after care. I played the bride and miles the groom. It was a play. With horrible songs and uncoordinated kids. Obs our parents made pictures and videos of that. And we each have one picture on our family picture walls. Miles is dating Lindy. They met 3 years ago and started dating last year. Lindy does not like me. So every time we concide at a celebration, she makes a comment about me being the typical girl best friend. She one time said that I secretly wanted to sleep with Miles.  I have no clue where she got that impression from. Miles and I have different friend groups and schedules. Besides the monthly catch-up over food, we didn't really meet that much. Things got worse when Lindy saw the wedding play picture.The comments just got more. She even started DMing me on Instagram saying she knew what game i was playing. I talked to Miles once about this, and he told me to give her time. So his birthday was on Saturday and I was invited. Lindy  wrote me saying something along the lines that she was going to supervise me. This was their first birthday as a couple, and I was not allowed to take up his time.  I was honestly just fed up. I tried talking to Miles once more, but he said the same thing. So I just skipped out. When the party started I wrote a quick sorry I can't come and told him my mother was going to bring his present. Now he is upset with me for missing his birthday Lindy is mad that I made it all about myself, and my parents are upset I missed a family function Aita ? Edit: I didn't show anyone the messages because it didn't want to make more out of this than it is. I didn't want to poison anyone against Lindy, especially not if she is a new fixture in Miles life. That would make both our lives more difficult. I hoped that just talking about it might be the more adult thing. My parents are not mad at me or blowing up my phone. Ala reddit fashion. They and Miles parents were just bummed out  that this was the first birthday that I ever missed. As to why she is jealous. I have no idea. Neither of our parents ever wanted us to get together. There were no jokes or anything about it. I think they also never would want that. The wedding play picture is in the living rooms because they loved the picture and it was our first play.",

She'd told me that she'd given up a child for adoption when she was young, so I was expecting that this might happen. What I didn't expect was that the truth was there was never any adoption. She just left the baby with the father and bailed.  The worst thing about this is that when Laurel was 12, she wrote my wife begging for help. Her response was to write her the nastiest reply imaginable (I've since had a chance to read it) that basically blamed her for her problems and threatened her against contacting her again and ruining her family.  I couldn't believe it. Not only has she been lying this whole time, but she actively had contact and chose to abandon her a second time while we were married. This has all been an emotional dumpster fire, but that's an issue of its own.  We've been in contact and building a relationship for the last few years. So much therapy. So far, we've kept this all away from our kids. At this point, it's been a few years, and there's interest in having everyone meet.  Thing is, between my wife and Laurel, they've come to an 'agreement' to tell the kids and everyone else in the family that Laurel is a family friend. Absolutely not. I'm sick of the lying. What they call each other is their own deal and I don't expect that to change, but I'm not lying anymore. I don't like lying to my kids as a policy, but lying to them about who's related to them and who isn't is dangerous. I only want them meeting if we can tell them the truth. Now I'm getting into it with my wife, Laurel, and my parents (the only outside people who know). They say I should go along with it not for my wife's sake but for Laurel's. I understand why she would want that, but I don't think I care anymore. The kids need to know.",

Claire is pregnant and had her baby shower yesterday. I wore a white and blue floral sundress. I didn't think anything of it because, as far as I know, white is only inappropriate for bridal events.  When I arrived at the shower, Claire's mood seemed to immediately sour and she was really cold toward me. Later, one of my other friends pulled me aside and asked me to leave. She said that Claire was offended by my attention seeking behavior and that it was inappropriate to wear white to Claire's event. I left.  I'm super confused. Like I said, I thought the white rule only applied to bridal events. Our friends are refusing to take sides but a couple have told me I should apologize even if I don't think I'm wrong. AITA?",

Our son has his father\u2019s dark hair but my daughter\u2019s is borderline dark blonde. Genes are weird, what are you gonna do? Both my kids and myself have my husband\u2019s last name, which is a popular Dominican last name. There have been times we get looks when people hear our last name and my husband isn\u2019t around. But it\u2019s never been too bad and usually, I shrug it off. Due to my husband\u2019s work schedule, he\u2019s rarely at school events. So, most people just know me. There\u2019s another little girl in my daughter\u2019s class with the same last name as us. Her mom also volunteers often. When we met, she flat out said \u201cyou\u2019re not Dominican.\u201d I said, \u201cno. My husband and kids are.\u201d She said \u201cbut your last name is (x)\u201d. I said yeah\u2026because it\u2019s my husband\u2019s. She pointed out how pale they are. I just said genes are weird. But almost every time we see each other, she brings it up somehow. Making comments about how pale the kids are. Finding it weird they don\u2019t know Spanish (my husband didn\u2019t learn growing up so they don\u2019t know it either). I just let it roll off because while it\u2019s weird, I\u2019m not about to get into a pissing contest. The teacher asked the kids to make collages about their cultures. My daughter\u2019s had stuff related to being a Dominican and stuff related to being Irish. They had a whole culture day where parents were invited. The mom of the other little girl saw my daughter\u2019s collage and rolled her eyes, thankfully not in front of my daughter. There were no other kids around at the time as they were getting food. It was just parents looking at the collages. I asked what her problem is. She said I\u2019m not a real Dominican. I said I never claimed to be. She said my kids aren\u2019t either and that my husband is probably only a little Dominican and we\u2019re claiming a culture that\u2019s not ours. I was dumbfounded. All I could ask was \u201care you stupid?\u201d She said there was no need to be defensive. Finally, I had enough, pulled out my phone and showed her pictures of myself with my husband and the kids. She stared at it for a moment and mumbled an apology. I said \u201cyeah, maybe research how genes work so you don\u2019t make yourself look stupid in front of a bunch of 3rd graders\u201d. She got teary eyed and walked away. I got the stink eye from some other parents which I ignored. When I told my husband later, he said calling her stupid repeatedly, when she already apologized, was an asshole move. AITA?",

        "selftext": "Me and my husband have been together for over nine years and separating our finances never occurred to me until this past year.  I'm the saver and he's the spender. In the beginning it didn't bother me because we had two incomes and wasn't rich but lived comfortably.  His family has always borrowed money from us but rarely ever pay that money back. I personally don't lend money not even to family but I do not stop him from lending to his.  A few years ago my husband was in a bad car wreck and can no longer work so I became the sole breadwinner. He now gets disability but that was a four year process. In that time we dwindled our savings to nothing and came close to losing everything. Our debt mounted and there was nothing I could do.  When he received his back pay I only asked him to pay off his vehicle a loan in which I've paid over 50 grand on in the last few years and put some in savings.  He did neither. Instead he blew the money. Loaning over 10 grand to his family and paying nothing towards the debt we created.  During this time I was able to save some money from my paycheck but not much and had plans to pay some debts off once I have enough saved. He knew I was saving to do this.  About a month ago I noticed over 700 missing out our savings and I asked him what happened!?! He replied with I loaned it to my parents. I asked when he was going to receive it back because that money was already spent and I needed it. He said I don't know when they can afford to.  I blew up an lost my shit. He didn't ask me, we didn't speak about it. He did it behind my back because he knew it would piss me off and I would say no if he asked. We had a huge fight. I figured after that fight he would stop. But no...  Yesterday I checked my account and another thousand dollars was gone. Gone where u ask? He gave it his parents. I'm so mad I see red.  I flat out told him that as of today I'm done with his parents. I'll pay half the household bills buy our food and that's it. If he wants to lend all his disability to them fine but I'm not gonna go bust my ass 60 hours a week so he can keep giving our money away.  So AITA for going to the bank and withdrawing all the money I put there and opening a new account he don't have access to? He seems to think I am and says that I should want to make his parents happy. I would like to see them happy I just don't want to pay for that happiness. ",

        "selftext": "Throwaway Account: I (34m) have been taking care of my sister's (32f) daughter for around 6 years. This all started when my sister got arrested for felony theft and drug charges. She's been a longtime addict, poor mouther, and family manipulator. No one else in my family stepped up, so I offered to take my niece in while my sister did drug treatment to avoid jail. From the beginning, my niece, then around 10, didn't want anything to do with her mom. I thought that was odd; but over the first few months I had her, my niece opened up about her mom having treated her very poorly. I sought a guardianship for my niece, and told my sister that I would not willingly send my niece back to her unless my sister got off the drugs and sorted her life out. My sister initiated a legal fight with me to terminate the guardianship. I grew to love this kid like my own, and I didn't want to send her back to a bad environment. It cost me six figures over the course of a year-and-a-half in legal fees. I won. I managed to marshal substantial evidence of my sister's ongoing substance abuse and the court relied upon the report of a court-appointed guardian ad litem who reported favorably about my niece in my care and about my niece's negative view of her mother. At some point in the legal process--as I was shelling out five-figure monthly legal bills--I learned that, as my niece's guardian, I was entitled to child support, so I filed the forms to seek it, and won it. The state oversees the support award, and is apparently pretty thorough in seeking it. Garnishing paychecks and bank accounts. Now--years on--I am starting to get pressure from other family to forgive the child support. I have family reaching out to me saying my sister is doing better and just can't get ahead having to give up portions of her paycheck every month. With back amounts, it's like 30k in back support that I am owed. I don't need it, really, if I'm being honest. I make a good living--better than anyone else in my family has done.    In all likelihood, sister's debt it will never be paid in full. But I don't want to let it go. I've started telling relatives, Hey--that's great that you want to help [sister]--why don't *you* pay me her 30k debt plus the present value of the award until niece is 18--and then I'll forgive [sister's] obligation. Relatives have been huffy at that response.    My sister initiated a fight with me knowing full well she was back on drugs, and lied about it, and got caught in open court. It was all a waste of a large amount of money, in my prime years, that I would have otherwise saved and set aside to retire on, or pay for my niece's education. I'm still mad about it, and my sister can owe me it forever for all I care. AITAH? \u00a0",

        "selftext": "My friend is having a hard time with her spouse, and really needs someone to be there for her while they work through their issues. We only just recently reconnected after not speaking for 4 years. Now, every time she calls she asks me what I\u2019m doing for the day or at that moment, and then invites herself, her family of 4, and some of her friends over to my house. Example 1 for clarity: Friday was her spouse\u2019s birthday. Monday she told me her plan was to take him to dinner. Then she calls me Friday morning asking me what I was doing. I told her I was just watching a movie on my couch. Then she says I know it\u2019s last minute, but I want to come over and BBQ at your house. She said the kids could play together and we could hang out and have some drinks. I hesitated initially, and then told her that I didn\u2019t really have a lot of meat here nor was my home \u201ccompany ready.\u201d She responded that she would grab some more food and do all of the cooking. Then I said okay. I cleaned up a little bit and then I received a second call. She excitedly told me that she invited her guy friend and he may bring a friend for me to talk to, AND a female friend of hers was also coming. I was so shocked that she was trying to throw a party not just come over and hangout with just her family like she implied during the first call. Her family already was 4 people that I was not expecting which would have made a total of 8 people including my own children. I have only met 2 of the 3 people she invited. She did not even ask if she could invite anyone else to my home or give out my address. Luckily, I got a call on the other line and told her I\u2019d call back. 2 hours passed by and she called me repeatedly. I decided to text her that something came up and I can\u2019t host a party for her husband. I did not receive a response. I waited another 2 hours and then called her to see how the BBQ party was going. She told me she didn\u2019t even have the BBQ party. Like wtf? I asked her why she didn\u2019t ask her friends to come to her apartment since she has her own BBQ grill and why didn\u2019t she at least go out to dinner like she planned originally. She literally didn\u2019t even answer the first question, but said she didn\u2019t want to spend a lot of money going out to eat.  Am I the asshole for making up an excuse to end the call and then ignoring all of her repeated calls to confirm? Edit: Thanks for all of the replies. I finally just told her that I\u2019m feeling used and that my house is not a place that she can throw parties or invite others to come to without my permission. She just responded via several texts that she \u201cdoesn\u2019t have to use anyone.\u201d ",

For his birthday, I baked a two layer banana cake and made the recipe of a vegan frosting and a vegan toffee sauce that was really good! When we were going to sing the usual Happy Birthday song, he stood up and was walking over the cake table while I was saying that I had baked a banana cake for him with vegan frosting and sauce. His answer, in front of everyone, was that he didn\u2019t know why I had baked him some cake if I already knew he didn\u2019t like them because he has not eaten in so many years that he doesn\u2019t even like it anymore. I felt hurt and didn\u2019t say a thing there. I thought that he would appreciate me baking a cake for his birthday because that\u2019s what his mom used to do when he was a kid and he always makes a comment about me not baking the kids\u2019 cakes.  Every time I go to the local bakery, I get him a banana cake and he eats it and says how much he likes it. The rest of the celebration, I was trying to act normal, but he noticed and when everyone left, he asked if I was ok. I said I was never going to bake him something. His answer was, thank you and that I was being unfair with him because I should have already know. Worst of all of this was that, my birthday is the same day as his. So I baked another cake for me because I wanted a chocolate cake, but this is just venting. AITA Reddit?

Stevie has had financial issues due to her lifestyle habits. I believe her boyfriend is in the same boat but both are recovering.

It\u2019s also my daughter\u2019s property and it\u2019s not like I can just give away her things.

        "selftext": "Update here https://www.reddit.com/u/Exotic-Front-643/s/IarsiqrMZ5 My daughter is one of the most well-adjusted and socially adept people I have met. She has organized her own birthday parties, excelled at debate team and the Feminist Roundtable club at her school where she organized a fundraiser for at-risk young women\u2026 I\u2019m beyond proud of her. She is an incredible person and I truly feel the sky is the limit for her. However, she has recently made a friend group who I believe is not great for her. Three people, two are non-binary and one girl, and all of them claim to be autistic. I guess this has rubbed off on my daughter because now she is also claiming to be autistic. My sister is following her on TikTok and I guess she posts \u201cstimming\u201d videos and other things. She has given me zero evidence before this point to even entertain the notion that she is autistic. I truly never even considered it until she met these friends. This leads me to believe it is made up. I have noticed that these friends are causing her to distance herself from her other friends that encouraged a more healthy lifestyle - friends she met in feminist roundtable for example who I really liked. She does not really do anything anymore but sit in her room and make videos with these friends about autism. It\u2019s really strange and has me feeling pretty bad. The other day her and her friends were in the kitchen and my daughter said something along the lines of \u201cshe wouldn\u2019t understand because she isn\u2019t autistic\u201d about a classmate. I calmly stated after she said this that she is not autistic either, has self diagnosed, and shouldn\u2019t patronize people by claiming that she is autistic as it is inappropriate to people who actually struggle. She got furious and stomped up to her room. Her friends followed. She\u2019s not talking to me anymore. AITA for \u201ccalling out\u201d my daughter?  Edit: thanks very much for your thoughtful responses. I made an appointment with a psychiatrist for next week for formal evaluation, and apologized to her for my poorly timed comment. ",

I have been going to Renfair since I was 16, usually with friends but once Sam and Maddy were 13, I started taking them with me. Kiara just turned 12 a few months ago and said she wanted to go to Renfair this year. I was hesitant but asked our mom and once she gave the ok, I actually got excited because (very sad about this) Sam is in the marines and can't go this year because he is deployed. That is, I was excited until I found out what she wanted to wear. Maddy and I have been planning and making our outfits since last Renfair (we are both avid seamstresses) and offered to help Kiara design her outfit. Kiara is really into Furries lately and has started making suits and masks but I made it clear that Renfair isn't the place for that and I was uncomfortable taking her in that. She agreed, we came up with a few outfit designs, and set a day to go shopping for all the stuff. She then came to me a week ago, gloating, saying that our mom said yes to her wearing a furry suit to Renfair. I told her she absolutely could, but again, I wouldn't be the one taking her if she chose to wear that. She got upset and said I was being unfair because I was still taking Maddy. I told her again that Renfair isn't the place, and who I take with me is up to me. She's now very upset with me and is trying to get our mom to make me take her wearing her furry suit. So... AITA? Edit to add: there are several reason as to why I stated not the place. Main being that it is still going to be in the 80's during renfaire and she wants to wear a full neon pink furry suit, head and all. Second, This is isn't a big renfair where you see all kinds of costumes. We live in a small town and aside from some tourists, it's mainly just people in our town. There's been plently of creature costumes, but nothing like what she wants to wear. We offered to help her do a fantasy creature type costume but she's doubling down. My mother isn't trying to make me take her, just said she was allowed. Also, I'm not embarrassed with her wearing this. I told her she can absolutely wear it next year when we go to comic con. ",

        "selftext": "Edit: I needed to bold a sentence  My sister passed away recently after a long illness, and before she died, she made very clear instructions regarding her funeral. She specifically did not want our brother, John, to attend or receive any of her ashes. To provide some context, growing up, my sister wasn\u2019t kind to John. **John also was not great**, they fought like cats and dogs. As an adult, she sought therapy, recognized the damage she had done, and tried to make amends. She apologized multiple times and reached out, but John refused to reconcile. He was clear that he didn\u2019t want a relationship with her. When she became ill, my sister made one last attempt to reconnect, asking John to visit her. He declined again, stating that he had no interest in repairing the relationship, even as she was dying. This hurt her, and she made it clear that if he didn\u2019t want to see her while she was alive, she didn\u2019t want him at her funeral or receiving any part of her remains. In her view, if he couldn\u2019t show up for her in life, he had no right to be there in death.  John showed up at the funeral uninvited, I think our unlce gave him the date and time In line with my sister\u2019s wishes, I asked him to leave. He became angry, caused a scene, and accused me of being cruel and preventing him from saying goodbye.  Several family members have since criticized my decision, saying I should have let him stay for closure. Saying that funeral are for the living but I pointed out this was her last wish  He thinks is am a huge jerk and I am a refusing to give him anything of hers still. The family is mostly split. So outside opinion",

        "selftext": "Today, I started talking to an American mother while in A&E; her child was interested in the artwork I have on my leather jacket as it's pretty colourful. The mother mentioned that her daughters name was Grain so I assumed for a while that she was another mother who wanted something special to call her child. I remarked that it was a unique name and that I'd never met anyone called Grain before.She told me that she's named after her great-grandmother and that it's an Irish name. At this point, the alarm bells are ringing in my head because I've realised that the kid is called Gr\u00e1inne (generally pronounced as Gro-nyuh, or there abouts.) I tried to be very tactful, and I was like, Irish has such an interesting alphabet. How is her name spelled? Irish names can be tricky. The kid is called Gr\u00e1inne. Not Grain. My partner, who has studied Ireland's political history as part of their dissertation and also the Irish diaspora and it's culture around their university city,  is stuck somewhere between stifling a laugh and dying of embarrassment on her behalf so I come up with, what I thought was a very positive reply.I said an old-school name and a more modern pronunciation. I think that's a great way to pick names. I would like to point out that I do not like the name Grain for a child, nor do I like the way the pronunciation was butchered, but I was trying to be tactful and positive. She asked what I meant, and I said well in Ireland, they typically pronounce it like gro-nyuh.Her face went red and said that I shouldn't have said that the pronunciation was wrong in front of the kid because now she's going to grow up knowing that her name is wrong and feel bad about it. I apologised for causing offence and restated that it's a lovely name in both ways and a fantastic nod to her heritage. I said that I'm sure her great-grandmother would be thrilled to be honoured by her name being used. I was throwing out just about every positive reinforcement that I could think of, but, to be frank, she was pissed off. She told me that I ruined her daughter's self-esteem and that her life [was] ruined by me saying that her existence is wrong. I didn't say that, by the way. I said that her name was pronounced atypically. Gr\u00e1inne, for context, was around 2 years old and completely unbothered by the conversation until her mother got angry at me. She was just looking at the pictures on my jacket. The conversation was maybe five minutes long, but I managed to ruin this kid's life. Hindsight says I should have kept my mouth shut and waited for somebody else in this city to say something.  So, AITA? Edit: spelling and syntaxEdit 2: Some people have assumed that we're in the USA, we're in the UK, in a city with lots of Irish people, an Irish centre, and a great Irish folk scene. ",

        "selftext": "I (17m) have a younger brother (15m) who has a number of serious disabilities from birth. He suffered brain damage at birth, has a missing kidney, has digestive issues that means he eats through a feeding tube, he cannot walk and can only make sounds instead of talking. My parents time and attention has to be focused on him more than on me. For the first few years after he was born I spent a lot of time with my grandpa who raised me from the age of 2 until I was about 7 and then I was seen as old enough to be at home after school and could make my own food and clean up after myself and not need supervision mostly. Grandpa was willing, and had offered, to keep taking me after school but my parents said he didn't need to do it and he deserved to live his life. I never get 1:1 time with my parents. They couldn't afford field trips and never took the time to apply for the school field trip fund so grandpa picked up the slack there. He paid into my school lunch account so I didn't have to make my own lunch. Grandpa was the person who'd pick me up from school if I was sick. He'd stay and take care of me at home since whichever parent would be home would really just say to go to bed or lay on the couch and relax and there was no caring for me or taking care of sick little me. When I was 11 I got picked for this junior programmers contest through our school district but my parents said they couldn't take the time for it so they refused to sign off and since grandpa couldn't, even though he offered to take me, I missed out on that. When my laptop broke in October 2020 it was grandpa who replaced it for me so I could, you know, school when school wasn't in person. When I got older I was asked to do more like cook for everyone, pick up meds or get the special bath ready for my brother. A few times my mom or dad even reprimanded me for not doing off my own initiative.  My parents have nothing set aside for me to go to college. They have never considered colleges. And last year I had my guidance counselor on my ass wanting me to go to college and wanting us to attend some college talk and my parents wouldn't go. I told her I didn't have money for college and she said she would reach out to my parents about forms. They never got back to her. She called, emailed, reached out repeatedly. Nothing. Then I told her I had decided to skip college and she was like nooo, nooo, you need to go and she tried reaching out to them again to talk about it but they didn't answer/respond. My parents wanted to get a night off and catch up with some friends in town and they asked me to babysit. I said no. My parents told me I should help my family and considering all they do for me. So I asked them, what have they ever done for me. I told them it had to be for me, not for my brother. I asked them to name one thing and I pointed out all the stuff they don't/didn't do. They called me spiteful and told me to stop looking at it through the lens of a kid. AITA?",

Just passive aggressive stuff but it became much worse when her dad passed away. She did not take it well and resulted in a lot of outbursts, I wasn't living there at this time. She went into therapy but overall didn't seem like it helped. She threatens to run away if I married their mom. So I stayed away but continue to date their mom. Overtime the two other kids started to stay at my place in order to get away from the drama. It was a rough time for them and we bonded even more.

During that time she destroy a lot of her siblings stuff for betraying there dad. Now I rarely see her and I prefer it that way. The two kids have a one and off relationship. I payed for my two kids wedding. I got a call from her asking me to pay for her wedding since I paid for the other two. I told her no. This started an argument about how it's unfair.

        "selftext": "Right now, we're hosting my sister and her family because their home was damaged by Hurricane Helene. There are some rules in place: be respectful of our living space, her sons are not allowed in my daughter Thea's room,and as soon as the repairs are done, they are out of here. Her sons broke one of the rules when they went in Thea's room and went through her things. They found one of Thea's special compression bras. Thea has been doing theater ever since she was little. The compression bra looks like a tank top and she uses it if she is playing a boy or a young girl and has to flatten her chest to better look the part. Their mom found it and threw it away. We didn't realize this until Thea was packing her theater bag for play practice and realized it was missing. This is not great because she's starring as Viola in her school's production of Twelfth Night.    Thea buys most of her theater stuff like makeup and costumes and the bra was pretty expensive, $50.  I told my sister she needed to pay us back so we can replace it.  My sister refuses because she says she isn't doing well financially and how dare I demand a homeless woman pay for her boys being boys. Not to mention, she doesn't think it's appropriate for her to have something like that. Our mom, who has always been soft on Judy, thinks we're being too harsh since she's a single mom who doesn't have a home right now.  I just want my daughter's stuff replaced, is that too much to ask? AITA? Edit: To answer some frequently asked questions: -Why won't my mom take them in? She lives in a retirement community that doesn't allow anyone under the age of 65. I'm not sure if temporary stays are ok, but if she let them live with her then she runs the risk of getting evicted. -I don't know how much damage was done to the bra itself. Thea's room was pretty trashed. We're talking clothes left on the floor, spilled perfume, and messing with a display shelf full of some of her old Disney dolls.  -All I know is that Judy saw the boys messing with the bra, thought it was another kind of breast binder, and threw it away.  -We got locks installed for Thea's room, along with our son and my husband's man cave after we found out the boys messed with his stuff. -Why did I let them in? I've hosted other family and friends during previous hurricanes and never ran into this problem, maybe someone's kids got into Thea's costumes but no harm no foul. I've always been raised to help others, especially family, in their time of need, but this has me wanting to set up boundaries now.  -Judy and her kids are going to have to find a new place to stay. I'm just waiting for my hubby to come home from work. We may need one of his friends for backup just in case. Edit 2: -I can't believe I forgot this. The boys are 8 and 6. ",

Bedtime is at 7:30. I told him I wasn't going to deal with that mess and if he wants to let her stay up that late he can be the one to get her to sleep.  I got the little one in bed and watched my husband play with her while I cleaned up. Tantrums started at 8 and she was miserable when he got her in the bath at 8:45. She was melting down in the bath, then in bed, and he eventually gave her the pacifier (we've been trying to wean her off) and brought her to our bed at 9:45. She finally fell asleep at 10 and my husband told me he's upset with me for leaving him to do everything by himself even when I knew they were having a hard time.

        "selftext": "My wife and I (both late 20s) had our first child together in June. Before he was born there was a lot of talk about names from different family members on both sides, but the pressure to tell was on my side specifically. We didn't tell a soul what the name would be until our son was born and we had left the hospital. My parents were disappointed when we announced our sons name. My family are very traditional in how they named us. We were each named after grandparents and that's how they feel everyone should name their kids. My wife's family don't have a tradition when it comes to naming babies. They just name them and go. No fuss or insisting on certain names. But my wife's side tends to favor more uncommon and unusual names.  My wife's and my taste tends to lean a lot more to her side than to mine. Which is how we ended up choosing the name Hollis for our son. This was not something my parents liked because they expected our son to be either Jack (my dad) or Parker (my FIL). But I know they were expecting a little Jack to be born. So that added to their reaction. But they quizzed us on our choice to break tradition and I told them it wasn't a tradition my wife's family used and we decided we weren't going to have one either. Over the last couple of months both parents have questioned why, have wanted to discuss other names for future babies. My mom has been the worst by far. She asked why we went with something so unlike the names we have in our family. I told her our family wasn't the only family involved, but that we also didn't take the family tastes into account. We went with what we liked. She pointed out our taste were a lot like my ILs and I said yes, but that it wasn't about my ILs and their taste, it was about my wife's and my taste. I told her I was done discussing it and since that point I now change the topic or end the conversation when she brings it up or refuses to let it go. We had a little naming ceremony on Saturday and my mom decided she was going to dig in her heels about the name and she told me we'd picked a stupid name and she hated it, she wanted us to change it and name him Jack or Parker. She told me we had no business breaking a long held tradition in our family and there's a reason those traditions are there so foolish people can't name their babies the worst names imaginable. She also said my ILs must be so smug thinking they'll have at least two stupidly named grandkids like they had all stupidly named kids. I lost my temper. I told her to shut up and accept that we're not naming our kids like she and dad named me and my siblings and I told her she would need to leave and learn to be more respectful because I would not take those insults against my wife or her family lying down. My mom hated being told to shut up and she said I had no excuse for rudeness to her face. I thought she was crazy when she was rude. AITA though?",

She's dealing with some anxiety post baby, some other mental health problems she had from before pregnancy (she has worked on them in therapy but the pregnancy and PP hormones have flared up some stuff on her). She's also disappointed she couldn't breastfeed. She didn't try to but that was in her best interest not to. And her reasons are not something she shares openly but I'm aware and so are her family who know her history. But she grew up in a home where the women breastfed. And while they understand, my mom and sister are also very pro breastfeeding, like militant about it. I warned them before my wife gave birth that they were not to try and pressure her or give her helpful tips about it when it was not happening. They didn't listen to me and brought her some info from a breastfeeding group they're both members of and told her there was zero reason for her not try try. This resulted in me telling them to leave. I let the rest of my family stay since they were good. But I told my mom and sister they had ignored my warning and I gave them a very clear one. They were shocked. They said my wife never expressed a good reason for not being able to. I stated she doesn't need to answer to either of them. They asked a few times after this when they could visit and I said not until they understand that they cannot cross that boundary that has been set. They brought me into a group call a few days ago and told me they want to come see us and I asked if they were going to respect the boundary. They told me they just want to help.

They accused me of being too harsh and disrespectful in the way I was talking to them and they feel like they're being punished for looking out for my wife and my son's best interests.

We realised early on that it was easier for him to use a step stool to reach what he needed in the kitchen than for me to constantly be crouching to get what I need as that gets painful quickly for me. This was fine, until my MIL came to stay with us two weeks ago. Her roof needs repairs, my husband and I have a spare room while my best friend doesn't so it was only logical she come stay with us. She has constantly been moving things about in the kitchen, lowering items as she doesn't want to use the step stool, which isn't anything to do with her age or fearing she'll fall she just doesn't want to. She keeps harping on about how it's ridiculous everything is so high up and it's rude for guests. My husband has repeatedly shut her down stating my comfort matters more than theoretical guests and asked her not to move things. She lets it go for a day then things are moved again.  I've expressed frustration to my Husband about this and the final straw came today when I went to make myself a coffee and could not find my coffee mugs anywhere, it took me five minutes to find them in my kitchen and I found them in the lower cabinet that I had to kneel to get them out of. I was angry and snappish at this as my back had hurt from getting my mug, and I told her if she couldn't stop herself from rearranging my kitchen she could get a hotel room as I have had enough of her entitlement.  This led to a lot of blustering and some tears that she was just trying to make it make more sense and how this is her sons home and how it's just a little reorganisation and that they shouldn't all suffer just because i'm tall, she then also began to say how i'm heartless to expect her to stay in a hotel over the holidays.  My Husband was clearly uncomfortable at this and didn't want his Mother upset but he told her that it wasn't just his home, but mine too and if she wouldn't respect my comfort and happiness then she would have to leave. She has went into the guest room and I can hear her crying still. My Husband is clearly getting anxious and upset over this but he's not backing down and I feel awful that my snapping led to him feeling like this, maybe I should have just put up with it or been more gentle about how I dealt with it? I honestly don't care that she's upset which may make me sound heartless but I hate that my Husband is feeling this way.",

        "selftext": "Today at our weekly team meeting one of my colleagues announced that she is pregnant and will be going on maternity leave in April. Everyone reacted with congratulations and excitement for her, and I did too. We all told her we're very happy for her and her family and wish her all the best.  A few minutes later, I was in the elevator with her and 3 of our other team members (so 5 of us out of a total team of 11 people) on our way back to our desks. Just for the sake of conversation, I asked her if she is having a boy or a girl. Her face kind off fell and she grimly and shortly said boy. I thought it was strange that she reacted like this, but let it go.  Then after I was back at my desk, she came up to me and said that my question was inappropriate, that she was planning on announce the gender herself but I forced her to say it like that in an elevator, so now half of our team knows and it killed the magic. I was honestly really confused and apologised profusely. She lectured me on how I shouldn't be asking personal questions and walked away.  I honestly couldn't have thought this was in any way a personal question. Is it too personal? I'm a 24 year old dude and I don't know anything about pregnant women or babies or social customs, I guess. I was just trying to be friendly. AITA? ",

        "selftext": "I (35 f) recently separated from my fiancee (35 m) due to his excessive drinking, but we are still close and regularly see each other.  After taking him to the ER overnight, I brought him home and he said he just wanted to chill solo so I left.  I attempted to message him, but didn't hear back. This is unusual for him, however I wanted to respect his boundaries. Late that night (~10 pm), my ex's mom woke me up calling to ask me to go over there and check on him.  (I had a key and she doesn't.) I declined to because I had just been woken up and figured that he was just ignoring both of us because he was drinking. And to be frank, I'm sick of the drinking and having to care for him.  I'm sick of begging him to do things like get out of a urine soaked bed so I can try to get him clean and dry.  I'm sick of the relentless drunk screaming and crying.  I'm burnt out. She ended up calling for a welfare check and when the police came he was drunk and severely ill. The doctor said he probably would have died if he hadnt been brought in that night.  It was to the point that the hospital refused to release him when he tried to leave AMA and got the police and county attorney involved to force him to stay.  His mom was pissed at me and refused to tell me so I only found out a couple of days later that he is in the ICU on a ventilator. I feel incredibly guilty that had it been in my hands alone, someone I care about would be dead so I came here to either relieve my guilt or be deservedly raked over the coals.",

        "selftext": "My (32f) Mother (60f) hosts Thanksgiving dinner at her house every year. It\u2019s a small event, with my parents, me, my brothers family and my SILs family attending. We avoid family quarrels by implementing a strict \u201cno politics\u201d rule and trying our best to be civil. I should probably mention that we are not a particularly close-knit family. We rarely see each other beyond these events since my Brother lives in South Africa and I travel a lot due to my work. Thanksgiving is important to my mom since it\u2019s one of the rare times we\u2019re all together. Anyway, the main problem I have with my mother is her constant critique of me. She has a habit of making passive-aggressive comments about my life choices, from my career to my lack of children to the way I dress. I\u2019ve addressed this with her multiple times, but she doesn't really seem aware of it. My father claims it is just her way of fussing and expressing that she cares. It does hurt though, because my brother is never criticised in the same manner. I cannot entirely fault her for her criticism, since I did majorly mess up my life a few months ago (depression) and it has affected her opinion of me negatively. It does not excuse the way I acted, but I just wanted to explain why I left. By the time we finished dinner, I was a bit prickly because of some of her commentary.  I made a cake for dessert. I was explicitly put in charge of it and no one specified what exactly I should make, so I opted for Maple Cheesecake. I did my best and I think it looked okay. Mum normally makes pumpkin pie, but I really hate pumpkins (they make me gag), so I thought perhaps we could try something new. As I was bringing out the cheesecake, my mom eyed it somewhat warily and announced that she\u2019d decided to make the usual pie as well. This caught me off guard. I asked why she didn\u2019t tell me beforehand, and she said something like, Well, we figured you\u2019d do your own thing, so I thought it was best to have a backup. She went on to cut the pie and serve it to everyone, instructing me to leave the cheesecake in the kitchen. When someone asked to try my dessert, she said lets not mix too many flavors at once, which just felt passive-aggressive. I know it's immature for an adult  to get this upset over a triviality, but I just (politely) refused as she was handing me a slice of pie, retrieved my coat and left. People were calling after me I think, but by that point I was crying for some reason and it would have been too humiliating to have an emotional outburst in front of everyone for no real reason.  My mom just texted me saying that it was incredibly rude and immature of me to leave like that, especially on Thanksgiving. My brother also sent me a message saying Im acting irrationally. I feel horrible for leaving so abruptly, especially because my parents are getting older and we are already not close. Something about my mother seems to turn me into a neurotic teenager and I hate it.",

She drives on field trips, she does homework with the kids, she handles play dates, she's the one adult my 10 year old likes, she's not dependent on screens, does art projects with the kids, she speaks 10 year old, and she's even teaching them how to cook and bake. They made mini quiches a few weeks ago.  My oldest is doing state testing right now and wanted a fun activity with her friends. Isabelle suggested a spa day and my daughter loved it. I set up a day for my 4 year old to go home with his grandparents and let Isabelle turn our living room into a spa. She picked up my daughter, my niece, and 2 friends, brought them to our house, and did their hair and nails while they laid back and did face masks.  I guess my niece was telling her mom how cool Isabelle is because my SIL texted Isabelle offering her a nanny position 4 days a week, matching whatever I pay her but for only 1 kid. Isabelle showed me the text and told me that she will have to think about it because the extra money would be nice. I told her if she promised to stay, next year I'd have her at 5 days a week with a $5 per hour raise. Isabelle turned my SIL down saying she had received a better offer and now she's telling my husband's family that I stole a nanny from her.  They're upset that I outbid my SIL and gave Isabelle extra money and hours just so my SIL wouldn't get her. My husband said it was petty. AITA for offering Isabelle a raise and more hours so she doesn't work for my SIL?",

About a month ago I hosted a small get together\u2026 to show off some Le Creuset cookware I obtained (getting older is weird). I had a whole little shindig with home prepared food, lots of fun times between pals. I didn\u2019t invite Rose.

She got defensive and said that she could have just come and not eaten anything. I said that in the future, maybe she should be more careful about what she says, because to me it was very clear. Rose has continued to tell people I\u2019m giving \u201chigh school mean girl to nurse pipeline\u201d (...I\u2019m an accountant) and all that. Am I really the asshole for not inviting her?

He has an very rough personality and because he was never allowed to work or do anything so in his 40\u2019s he doesn\u2019t have friends. He still dominates the conversation at every holiday with \u201cfun facts\u201d and goes off on those and doesn\u2019t realize no one is listening.  My other siblings and I just really don\u2019t like David because my parents let him do whatever and just dominate whatever social settings we are in. My older sister eloped because of David being my mom kept trying to find David a \u201cplace\u201d at her wedding.  I\u2019m getting married to Mel, and my youngest brother Nick is my best man. My sister who is close to Mel is in the bridal party.  Her husband is one of my best men and their son is a ring bearer.  My wife wants a real wedding and not be forced to elope like my sister did.  David has no place. He\u2019s not going to be invited because the first thing he did was insult the ring I got my Mel was his \u201cfun facts\u201d about how diamonds are worthless and do not resell well. I should have got her a second hand engagement ring or a colored stone engagement ring. We then got a history on engagement rings and marriage tradition. We tried shutting him up but he wouldn\u2019t and my mom said let \u201cthe professor talk\u201d Even at 40 she thinks my brother fun facts are cute.  This put a hard no on Mel\u2019s stance that my brother can't come to the wedding. If my parents defend him, even once, they are not coming. She not having not wedding like my sister and it\u2019s time for David to be put in his place.  Mom called and asked about wedding planning and I told her she wasn\u2019t involved after what happened to my sister wedding dress shopping (Mom brought David who told everyone his fun facts about wedding dress history) that\u2019s when my sister decided to elope.  I told mom if she and dad wanted to come to the wedding as guests they can but David isn\u2019t invited. Mom didn\u2019t talk for awhile. I think she started crying because my dad took over the phone call. I told him what upset mom and said David isn\u2019t invited and mom can\u2019t be trusted to be involved in wedding planning without David tagging along.  Dad said he doesn\u2019t understand why we all hate David and I told him what is wrong with his \u201cfun facts\u201d  My dad said \u201cthe boy likes to talk and there\u2019s no harm in it\u201d  I told my dad that\u2019s the thing there is harm in David\u2019s fun facts and now no one wants to be around him.  Dad started arguing saying stuff in defense of David and I told dad we are at a stalemate and I guess all 3 of you won\u2019t be coming to the wedding.  I\u2019m sorry but that is how it is. I ended the conversation with my dad and my mom has been upset texting like a crazy person to everybody about how we all need to understand David. What I\u2019m doing is mean. Mel feels like this whole thing is why I can\u2019t invite David or my parents. I agree that they can\u2019t even be trusted to come to my wedding without sneaking David in. ",

This is their first year taking swimming lessons, and, at their age, the lessons require one-one-one with the child/adult as well as an instructor to teach. So me, my husband, and two of my husbands friends came along. (Unfortunately all four of the kids got booked for the same time). They started the lessons on Monday and ended today (Friday).  At the lessons, all the other kids had their mothers/female guardians with them, and all of them wore shorts/shirt swimsuits. My husband/his friends had trunks with no shirt, and I wore a two piece. Nothing bad, everything was well covered, but obviously my stomach and back showed. I didn\u2019t think it was a big deal, and I honestly didn\u2019t even notice what everyone wore until probably Wednesday. And it was fine because everybody (including me) was modest.  However, they finished their lessons today. When everyone was getting changed to leave, a few mothers came up to me. They said they didn\u2019t want to mention it earlier to make classes awkward, but they and a few other mothers were uncomfortable with how I was wearing a two piece to the lessons all week. The suggested if I do another class with my kids here, I cover up my stomach because nobody wants to see it Because of the stretch marks from my pregnancy. (Which is a lot more than average because I had quadruplets). I asked if they had an issue with how my husband/his friends didn\u2019t wear a shirt at all, and they said the didn\u2019t care because they didn\u2019t have the \u201cbaby belly\u201d like I did.  Now I\u2019m back home, and I can\u2019t decide if they were being rude or just were honest. They made sure to tell me it wasn\u2019t about the modesty, it was just my stomach. I never thought about it, so maybe it\u2019s my fault for being careless and not thinking of everyone else. My husband says I was fine, but all the mothers there apparently don\u2019t think so. AITA? Edit: I did not expect this to blow up so much! I\u2019m so thankful to all the kind comments, I\u2019ve spent 20 minutes reading and upvoting there\u2019s just so many Lol. This has made me feel much better about the situation. Fortunately (or unfortunately) this isn\u2019t our usual pool and we\u2019re done lessons until next year so I won\u2019t have the chance to say anything you suggested to those people \ud83d\ude02.",

When I got my new job I did my budget and saw that I could send home roughly $1,300 a month without it affecting my personal comfort. I would still be able to save for my future and my mom and dad could retire.  So when I was home I set up a joint account for us. That way I could see is they needed more and make sure that they were not getting scammed or anything.  After about a year and a half I started noticing that there was a $200 transfer every month. I asked them about it and they said he was having difficulties with his budget so they were helping him out.  My brother doesn't need help. He is a scholarship student. He actually receives a stipend from my home government to study abroad. What he wants is money to party.  So I reduced the amount I give them by $200. Obviously they do not need it if they can afford to give it away every month.  My mom called me when she noticed and was yelling at me for being a crappy daughter and sister. I asked her to tell me exactly how much money they contributed to my party fund when I was away for school. Just so you know the answer is $0.00. They also tried to talk me out of attending  university in Canada. I'm not sure how common the idea of filial piety is in other cultures but it's a big deal in mine. She went off about it.  I told her that they didn't need the money and I had better ways to spend $200 than to gift it to my brother so he could get drunk with his friends more.  She said that I am treating them like children by restricting how they spend their money. I replied that I was not going to subsidize my brother through them. And that from now on the amount they got from me would be $1,100. And that if they sent him money again I would know and reduce their money by that amount going forward.  My brother called me to bitch me out about cutting off his money from our parents. I said that I hadn't. He was welcome to tell our parents to go back to backbreaking jobs at their age to pay for his partying in London. Then they would have my money to live off of and their wages to pay for his drinking.  My boyfriend is on my side. As are many of my friends. Most of my family and people from my culture think I am being an asshole. However for the last two months my parents have only been spending on themselves.",

I love my job and I love my friends so it has always been an easy choice for  me. However I am currently 26 weeks pregnant with my first child and trying to lessen my workload as I prepare for my maternity leave and pass larger projects over to my employees.  My friend informed me last night that she is getting married, I was of course so happy for her and congratulated her, she asked if i'd be making her dress for her and I told her of course, to just let me know when they had a date and I was told they already had a date, January 19th. That was fine, a year and five months, perfect, plenty of time to do the designs and make it and I expressed as much to her but she corrected me, it wasn't January 19 2026 like i assumed, but January 19, 2025. I was a bit shocked at this and told her that if that's the date she'd picked i'd have to take back my promise as there is no way I can make her dress in that time frame as i'll not be too long post partum.  I asked her to reconsider the date if she wanted  me to make a dress  pointing out how five months wasn't much to plan a wedding anyway but she insisted that was when she wanted it, I didn't push as it was up to her but I made it clear I will not be able to make her dress for her then.  She didn't understand this at all pointing out how i'll be taking time off work soon anyway and can't I just use that time to make her dress. I admit in hindsight I got a bit snappish here and she likely didn't realise just how much work goes into a wedding dress but I asked her if she'd hit her head and why she'd think  it's ok to ask me to put stress on my pregnancy for her wedding dress?  She has been putting messages in the group chat calling me out for it and saying how it's easy to tell who my favourites are and it's clear her feelings are hurt. I'm annoyed but also feeling a bit regretful about this, I can't trust my employees to make a wedding dress without me as their skill level isn't up to that but maybe I could have a rehearsal dinner dress made for her or even a reception dress to soothe the hurt of her not getting the custom dress she wants",

My wife's younger brother (Joe) and his GF are moving into an apartment together at the beginning of June.  But GF's lease is up at the end of April so she needed to move out of her place.  But Joe currently lives in a studio apartment so he doesn't have room for all her stuff.  So they were going to move all of GF's stuff into a storage unit for a month until they get their new place together. A little over a month ago Joe had asked my wife if we would be able to help them move GF's stuff and she agreed.  My MIL was supposed to watch our son so we could both help, but she fell ill and had to cancel.  My wife suggested trying to get a babysitter for that day but I didn't want to spend hundreds on a babysitter to help someone move, that's dumb.  And bringing a 4-year-old with us would not be helpful to anyone.   This turned into an argument between us because she said I should help them move while she watches our son since I'm stronger than she is and I know how to drive our truck with a trailer.  I told her that she should help them and have them rent a U-Haul for the day.  We compromised by telling Joe that I would help them but they need to get a U-Haul instead of using our truck and trailer.  Then, the morning of the move (this past Saturday), my wife told me that a friend of hers got suite tickets through work to a hockey game for that day and invited them.  Yes, suite tickets to a playoff hockey game.  She said she would be bringing our son since her friend was bringing her kids too.   Great, so not only do I get stuck helping someone move, but my wife and son get to go have an amazing experience together that I miss out on.  And yes, this was my son's first major sporting event and I was missing it.   And wouldn't you know it, Joe never got a U-Haul.  And his GF wasn't even close to packed up and ready when I got there.  I spent 7-8 hours and multiple trips back and forth helping them move.  All the while my wife is sending pictures to our family group chat of how much fun they're having at the hockey game.   When everyone was home that night, my wife was surprised that I wasn't in a good mood.  She said that I acted like I barely cared when our son was telling us about the hockey game and how much fun it was.  I asked her if she was seriously confused about why I was upset and she told me to tell her.   So, I started railing off all the reasons I had to be pissed off.  She volunteered me to help, she got to spend the day doing something very special with our son that I missed out on, her brother and his GF were not prepared, and I had spent the entire day doing manual labor.  I ended my little rant by telling her that she is never going to volunteer me to help her family ever again.   She told me I was overreacting and I can't hold it against her that her friend invited them to the game. She also said I'm not being fair by blaming her for Joe and his GF.  ",

        "selftext": "I (M30) started seeing June (F29) about 3 years ago. My mother has never really liked June for a couple reasons, the main one being the fact that June didn't let my mom push her around. She kept firm boundaries which I really admired and she even helped me do the same. My mom hated this, calling June controlling and wishing I hadn't broken up with my previous girlfriend Margo, who my mom loved. I was with Margo for 5 years and it was horrible. Margo was very controlling and manipulative and always guilted me into things I wasn't comfortable with. But thanks to support from friends and my sister, I was able to leave her. It was hard, but I had help and my life has improved since. My mom was very upset with this but relationships didn't last so she eventually let it go until I started dating June about a year later. When June and I announced our engagement my mom didn't freak out, which was weird considering my mom hates June. She was very calm but I just took it as she was finally accepting this and so I didn't think much of it. Everything was fine and smooth up until the wedding. I gave both my parents plus one\u2019s to the wedding since they both remarried after I graduated college. So I\u2019m not close to their spouses but gave them the option of inviting them.\u00a0 We had a very small ceremony. Just immediate family and a few close friends. After the ceremony, me and June went to take pictures and then met back with everyone we invited to the reception which was pretty big. When we got there, My sister and June\u2019s best friend/maid of honor ran up to us in a panic. Before they even said anything I spotted it. My mom was at the table with my dad, my dad's wife, and Margo. I wanted to freak but June kept me calm. I walked over, pulled them both aside, and simply told them to leave. My mom tried to explain Margo and I are soulmates and June is just in the way of true love but I wasn't hearing it. I didn't care. Just got my best friends to escort them out and I returned to the party where luckily, after a few moments, I was able to relax and enjoy it. I really didn't think this would all turn into something huge but me and June just got back from our honeymoon where we didn't have our phones, and seeing mine I saw hundreds of texts from multiple family members. They all think I was an asshole for kicking my mom out of her only son's wedding. For the record, she was there for the ceremony but apparently was really upset she was kicked from the reception. Here's a summary of my family's thoughts. Some think I could have just ignored Margo and didn't have to \u201cfreak out.\u201d A few others, including my dad, think I should have just kicked Margo and let my mom stay but after the stunt my mom pulled, I didn't want her there either. I\u2019m starting to second-guess myself since everyone is really mad. June and my sister are on my side but I fear my dad may be right and I should have just let my mom stay and made Margo leave. So I\u2019ve come to Reddit, AITA?",

        "selftext": "I(17f) have had a rocky relationship with my dad. My parents married after I was born, hoping to provide a stable family for me, but they divorced when I was 11 after my dad went to rehab, & things only worsened from there. During rehab, he met his current fianc\u00e9e, and they later had a kid(6F). Since then, my dad has been mostly absent from my life\u2014whenever I have important events, he either has an excuse or doesn\u2019t show. I\u2019d estimate he\u2019s been present for less than half of my events since their divorce. A few years ago, I was diagnosed with scoliosis, & initially, surgery wasn\u2019t needed. However, my condition got worse, & I was finally scheduled for surgery on 11/20 of this year. I told my dad about it months ago, expressing how much I needed his support this time, & he promised he\u2019d be there. But later, he texted to say he\u2019d planned a vacation that would keep him away until mid-December, just as my recovery period would be ending. It broke my heart, but I accepted it. Then, 2 hurricanes hit his vacation spot, & he told me he\u2019d make my surgery. I felt a glimmer of hope. But then, just a week before my surgery, he texted again saying his fianc\u00e9e\u2019s lung cancer surgery had been scheduled for the same day, a few hours before mine, at a hospital 30 minutes away. He said he \u201cmight not\u201d make it to my surgery, but with him, \u201cmight not\u201d usually means \u201cwon\u2019t.\u201d He added that this wasn\u2019t about who he loved more. That message shattered me. I realized that no matter how much I hoped, he might never give me the attention & support I needed. I broke down on my kitchen floor that day. After sitting with my feelings, I texted him to tell him how deeply his actions hurt me. I said it wasn\u2019t only about love but about showing care, & that he\u2019d given me hope only to let me down again. I questioned if his fianc\u00e9e\u2019s surgery had really been scheduled last minute, or if he had known earlier but hadn\u2019t told me. I asked him to show he was my dad through his actions, not just his words. He responded, insisting the surgery was only scheduled the day he\u2019d told me. But because he\u2019s lied in the past to save face, I reached out to someone who might know the truth. I then sent a follow-up message, clarifying that my frustration wasn\u2019t with his fianc\u00e9e; it was with his ongoing absence & lack of support. I said that even if his reasons were genuine, he could have at least shown some empathy. I told him I hoped he\u2019d be a better father for my half-sister than he has been for me. In a final message, I made it clear that I was done putting in all the effort to maintain our relationship on my own. I told him that if he wanted to be my dad, I would gladly be his daughter, but if he chose not to, I would be fine with that too. He hasn\u2019t responded, & honestly, I\u2019d prefer he sit with what I\u2019ve said. For once, I hope he really thinks about his actions & the impact they\u2019ve had on me. So, AITA?",

This was apparently the wrong thing to do since it led to my wife deciding that since I was never home she should bang other dudes.  When I work out of town I earn about $240,000 a year. Where I live child support for two kids is about $3,300 monthly. With that salary.  Since my divorce I went to 50/50 custody and I work in town so I only earn $100,000 yearly. So my child support is actually only $800 a month.  My ex is going nuts because she isn't getting what she thought she would. My lawyer has tried explaining that child support is based on income and since I am not working crazy hours to make lots of money for vacations and a huge house I don't need I do not earn as much.  She is telling everyone what an asshole I am for cutting back on my work to deprive my kids. That is bullshit. I have my kids half the time. And since I cannot be out of town I earn less.

        "selftext": "I (F38) just got back from a vacation with two of my longtime friends, Kate (F40) and Mary (F38). I've known them both since university, and we've always been close. The three of us had been planning this Bali trip for a few months, along with our husbands and their kids (they both have children under 5, while my husband Jake (M45) and I are childfree). We agreed to split the cost of a four-bedroom villa three ways, and everything seemed fine at first. Jake and I arrived in Bali earlier than the rest of the group because we had different flights. Once we got to the villa, we waited to choose rooms with our friends and didn\u2019t mind when they both chose the ones with ensuites. We had a great time during the trip\u2014Jake and I did some couples activities (massages, hiking, dinners), but we also spent time with Kate and Mary and their families whenever it worked for everyone. To be nice, I even surprised them with massages to give them a break. The only thing that made me uncomfortable was that whenever I ordered a drink (a cocktail before dinner, or a glass of wine with meals), I'd get comments like Oh, you're drinking again? For context, I\u2019m a social drinker and don't drink often, but we were on vacation, and I didn\u2019t think it was a big deal, especially since our husbands were drinking too. I just ignored the comments so I could enjoy the trip. On the last night, Jake and I made plans with the guys to go out, and Kate and Mary said they were staying in to pack. Jake convinced me to join him, and since it was the last night of our vacation, I didn\u2019t want to stay in either. We went out and had a great time. We got home at 1am and I passed out straight after. The next morning was a bit chaotic with everyone packing and checking out, but we all made it back home without issue. We had booked business class seats back so we were separated during the flight and said quick goodbyes at the airport. A week after returning home, I got a long text from Kate saying that both she and Mary wanted to reduce contact with me because I had ruined their vacation. They mentioned several things, like me drinking every night, that I wasn\u2019t acting like a \u201cgirls\u2019 girl,\u201d that I booked different flights, didn't hang out with them enough, and that I was selfish for not helping with their kids. She even said I was just focused on partying and not acting my age.This message really hurt me.  I cried after reading it, and I honestly don\u2019t know what to think. I thought I was just enjoying my vacation, but clearly, they had a very different view. I haven\u2019t responded yet, and my husband has been asking what\u2019s bothering me, but I don\u2019t know what to say. AITA for how I acted during the trip? --- **Edit:** Thank you, Reddit, for all your kind words and support. Reading through the responses and seeing how many of you are upset on my behalf has made me reflect on how I initially planned to handle things. I was going to apologize, thinking it might be the easiest way to keep the peace, but now I realize that might not be the right approach after all. I have also showed my husband, Jake, this post and the text message, and he told me to thank you for looking out for me. He\u2019s actually pretty angry on my behalf about the text message. I showed him some of the comments that gave me insight on how my friends may have been feeling which has given us both a lot to think about. He asked me what I wanted to do next and if I wanted him to respond to my friends for me. While I appreciated the offer, I told him I\u2019m still thinking it over. He reassured me that he\u2019s here for me no matter what, and if I decide I want him to step in, he\u2019d be ready to say something on my behalf. For now, I\u2019m going to sleep on it and take some time before I respond or don't respond to the text message. If I do, I'll post an update. Again, thank you all for helping me see things a bit more clearly. I feel less alone in this now.",

This morning my mom texted me to say \u201cRent starts up again, $150 a week\u201d.  I just told her I will move out. I already pay for my own meals, I only have my small bedroom to call my own in their house. I can rent a studio apartment 3 or 4 times the size of my room for a few hundred more, or could rent a room with friends for less than my mom is trying to charge me. It would be one thing if they cooked and cleaned for me every day and I was raking up their bills but I do my own thing, pay my own bills, I never really even cross paths with my parents besides when I am getting off work.  My moms definitely pissed that I said that, I can tell. But I'm also upset the person who birthed me is trying to get me to pay what I would pay a landlord for rent just to sleep in her house.  Even 100 a week I would have been more inclined to be okay with, but 600 a month just to be able to sleep at my parents house seems a little high. If I am paying $600 a month I think I would deserve my own spaces around the house also as I would with a landlord, it seems having a landlord would be a better deal for me in this case. ",

The money was supposed to be for my future and nobody was supposed to touch it unless I really needed it and it was pretty specific. I read through it 5 months ago when shit went down. My dad got married again when I was 10 and he has an 8 year old stepdaughter and now a 4 year old daughter with his wife Louise. My half sister was diagnosed with a rare condition when she was 2. It was always clear something was wrong but they had a really hard time figuring out what it was. Doctors would say she'd be fine when she was older. This condition isn't life threatening, like she won't die from it, but it could potentially leave her permanently disabled in a bad way. A few months ago they found out about this hard to get into treatment for it. But it was expensive. There was/is ways to get help paying for it but that takes longer. So my dad decided he would use the inheritance mom left me to pay for it. He tried asking me but he was going to do it anyway and when I said no he told me as much. Then he shamed me for saying no, for putting college before the health of my half sister. Louise was in the room with us but she wasn't talking before I said no. She asked me how I could look at my half sister at the life she will have if we don't do something and say no. I told my dad I would never forgive him if he took the money. After I read her will (grandparents had a copy) I brought up the fact it was only for my needs it could be spent before. He told me mom was dead and he hoped she'd understand. I told him I never would. He told me I'd understand when I'm older. I told him I hated him and I told Louise she better never speak to me again because I found it disgusting she'd encourage stealing from me and taking my mom's money. I told my grandparents what dad did. They're my mom's parents but had stayed friendly with dad and there were times they would help him. They shared stuff with him all the time and grandpa would look at dad's car for free if anything was wrong. That all stopped when I told them. Dad couldn't figure out why until he confronted them about it last week. They told him he had some nerve stealing from me, taking their daughter's money and spending it on *his* child. My dad was mad they didn't understand and support his decision. He confronted me about it and complained about what I did. I laughed and told him I had warned him I would never forgive him for it. He asked how I got to be so heartless and selfish. I told him I would never forget what he did. AITA?",

        "selftext": "I (20f) have had three close friends in college, Grace (21f), Matt (21m), and Laura (21f). Laura really likes using mental health terminology. She explores a lot of labels from those therapist influencers online. She's was told that she has an anxiety disorder and depression but that's the only diagnosis she's been given so far. Recently she's been exploring autism and ADHD. Matt wanted to propose to Grace. They've been dating for a while. He's been planning the proposal for a couple of weeks and while the proposal was very intimate between the two of them I was very involved in scheduling the after-proposal event at a restaurant. The specifics of that are irrelevant to the story but it was lovely and Grace and Matt seemed really happy. Laura told us that she didn't want to be involved in planning the proposal because it reminded her of her parents' divorce. She said that she might come to the post-engagement party. Well come the day of the engagement and both Matt and I forget to check in on Laura. I don't think it's Matt's fault at all because he was occupied with far more important things but I feel a bit guilty about not reminding her. She ended up not coming to the party. The next day she starts posting online some dramatic (for lack of a better word) things about how it was traumatizing to see how little her friends cared about her, and that she'll be updating her followers on her trauma therapy journey. She posts that she's now in a really dark place and she thinks she has PTSD. For context, I'm pretty sensitive to mentions of trauma and PTSD because I was diagnosed with PTSD by a psychologist in my last year of high school after something that happened in my first. I've felt a lot of guilt and shame around this because I spent a lot of time feeling that the thing that happened wasn't bad enough to count. I sometimes still get nightmares and flashbacks but it's gotten better after therapy. I know that I have my own issues wrapped up regarding the word and it bothers me a lot when people seem to throw the terms around without understanding their weight but I also acknowledge that I can't stop the internet from doing its thing. I haven't told any of my college friends about this, so Laura doesn't know. At one point she called me and starting explaining how traumatized she is and I finally snapped and said, You're not traumatized, stop being dramatic, you just got exactly what you asked for. Now I feel guilty because I feel like I was a little harsh, and she's posting online (without my name at least) that one friend that she thought she could rely on to support her is abusive and doesn't understand how being traumatized works. However, I feel like honestly, Laura's being very dramatic about an event that's not about her. I called my mom to see what her opinion is and she told me that I could've reminded Laura about the party and while my point is not necessarily wrong, I could've been more sensitive, so now I'm not sure how wrong I am.",

        "selftext": "I kind of know I am the asshole, but I need to know how bad it was. My brother is 29 and has been with Lia for about 2 years. We all like her; she is super nice. I am getting married next April and sent an invite to my brother's apartment. We decided to send invites to households and not individuals. For example, our aunt received an invite for her family and not for each individual. Last Thursday, we met at my parents' place. It was just the core family because of some tax reasons, lol. While there, I asked my brother about Lia's dietary restrictions. I know that she is a vegetarian for health reasons and that she cannot have certain raw vegetables. He said that she wasn't going to come and that he was taking his girl best friend, Amanda, instead. Now, their relationship is weird af. Amanda has always been stringing my brother along, in my opinion. He always denies having feelings for her, but let's be real here. Amanda would date other guys, blow off my brother, then when things were on the decline with her partners, she would be attached to him again. Her last boyfriend broke up with her right around the time my brother, his then ex-girlfriend, Amanda, and her ex were supposed to travel to Spain. What did my idiot brother do? Go with Amanda alone because Amanda was uncomfortable with his ex-girlfriend. Obviously, he acted blindsided when his girlfriend broke up with him. I didn't even say anything anymore because it's all so weird. So, when he said that, I asked if Lia already had other plans. But my brother said that Amanda had asked if she could come because it would be an opportunity to finally see the old gang (we were in the same friend group in high school). I told him that I would have invited Amanda if I wanted her there. Amanda is mean and cold. She always makes disparaging comments about other girls. At every event, around one hour in, she will make some sort of scene that either has her running away crying or sitting mad at a table telling everyone to leave her alone and then making a cryptic comment about something hurting her. I told my brother I was revoking his plus one and Amanda was NOT coming to our wedding. He accused me of being misogynistic and bigoted because I don't understand opposite-sex friendships. Which is BS. My husband has a female childhood friend who is his best woman. I love her too and she has been amazing. AND SHE RESPECTS FUCKING BOUNDARIES. She always includes me and made a huge effort when I started dating my fianc\u00e9 to integrate me into the friend group. Anyway, I said my decision was final. He could take it or leave it, but I would be inviting Lia myself because I like her. He screamed at me and told me to keep out of his business. I said to get rid of his weird fucking feelings for Amanda.He is mad at me. My dad said is none of our deal. My mom is furious with my brother. So Aita? Edit: to answer some questions  The invite was addressed to the smith's. Funnily enough, Lia had the same last name as us. Granted, we have one of the most common last names. Yes, they live together. The tax thing is nothing huge. My parents have a small buisness but are really bad at keeping track of all their receipts. So every month we go and help them. We digitalis the receipts and put them in a bookkeeping software for the accountant *Amanda is in the comments. Say hi!*",

Where's my family staying? She already promised them that they would move in with us, and she us now furious that You only care about yourself. What about me? I told her that I didn't agree to that from the start. Now she's looking to sell the land from under me to prove a point, I guess. Info: The land is owned jointly by me and my wife. It was purchased using the life insurance payout we got for the death of our one year old girl in 2021. Between then and now, I got a manufacturing job with a federal government contractor.  Her family has no stake or rights to our land. I got a call from the town's registrar about the ownership change inquiries for the land. We actually own 2 parcels, and I offered her to sell one parcel to her siblings for market value, but she declined. The house will be paid by me. I told her if her family want, I can do an ADU, but they will pay market value for their rent, per room. So, about 900 each. She declined. My current course of action is to transfer my ownership of the land into a trust with my kids as primary owners with express instructions that only direct descendants of me may build and live on the property.",

        "selftext": "Apologies in advance as I had a hard time writing the situation in a single sentence. My brother has been trying to push me to get closer to his girlfriend Mary (together 3 months). I've done my best to get to know her (initiating dinners, trying her hobbies with her, etc.) but we honestly don't really get along.  I personally think she's a snob (she complimented my designer bag, but took the compliment back when she found out it was thrifted. As in literally said yike, I take that back) while she thinks I lack culture and sophistication (also something she's mentioned when trying to convince me to do a makeover with her).  The issue is that I'm getting married this year, and my brother has been REALLY trying to get her involved. I put my foot down with the bridal party since they've only been dating for 3 months and I don't know her, but he insisted that I invite her to the bachelorette. It was originally supposed to be super lowkey and local. Mary tried to push for something more extravagant, but it really wasn't in my budget. When I wouldn't budge, she told us something came up that weekend and she couldn't go.  I was later surprised by my friends who had come together to organize a lavish weekend through favors and points (i.e. one of my friend's aunts works for a spa, so she was able to get discounted packages, another used her travel points to book a suite, etc.). I was not told about this, and was truly and happily surprised.  The issue is that Mary found out when we posted pictures and she was PISSED. My brother is now saying that I deliberately left her out, but she told me she was busy! Mary said that if she had known what the weekend was like though, she would have rearranged her schedule. I feel conflicted because I suspect that my friends didn't tell Mary on purpose, but they're claiming they made these plans after Mary bowed out and didn't reach back out since she was busy.  My brother still says I should have double checked and made more of an effort to let Mary know my plants, so I figured I'd ask the internet for their thoughts!",

        "selftext": "Hello AITA-- We are at the beginning of my dad's retirement family trip. He is paying for all of us to meet as a family in Hawaii for a week since he is retiring after working at the same company for 42 years. There are six of us but my brother and I live in the same part of the country.  I guess it's relevant to say I am 5'1 and my brother is 6'6. I fly all the time for work and have quite a bit of status with the airline for which my dad bought our tickets.  This is what happened way earlier today. We were all boarded and ready to go when a flight attendant came up to me and whispered that they had a first class passenger not show up and they needed the coach seat to accommodate a standby passenger. She said I had by far the most status of anyone on the plane so they were willing to move me to first class for free. I was like oh yeah--and I took it in a heartbeat. I told my brother I'd see him in 12 hours and let me know if he wanted any food or drink and I grabbed my stuff and moved. Needless to say I had a nice flight.  When we landed and were waiting for our shuttle my brother was so pissy but wouldn't tell me what was going on. He didn't speak to me the whole shuttle ride. We had a nice hello with the rest of the family but after I got down from my shower my mom took me aside and said what I did was awful. I asked her what she was talking about and she said that I should have given my brother the seat. I thought that would be the end of it but all 5 of my siblings and my parents are upset with me and the vacation is off to a very rough start.  I was trying to play with my niece and nephew in the lobby waiting for lunch and my sister said no they only like to play with people who give a shit about their family--what were you thinking? I asked her if this was about the first class thing and she said what do you think its about? I said that he never asked me to switch with him, she said an asshole makes people beg, family members don't. I've been by myself since brunch and not having much fun. AITA? Edit: wow this totally blew up, thank you for commenting everyone. I only saw my family for a little but yesterday and they were still made at me to varying degrees. I have a really good friend that lives here in the military so she hung out with and we met some really fun and cute guys at a dive bar. So my vacation will be great no matter what. But reading your comments really gave me to confidence to not give a crap (or try to at least!) thank you.",

        "selftext": "So I (16M) still live with my family, obviously. I have chores just like my siblings. But something I do for fun and because I love and have a passion for it is cooking. I started cooking for myself 3 years ago. I had cooked before but nothing like the last three years. I enjoy making my own breakfast and dinner and even lunch if I have no school. My parents saw I was cooking more and they added that to my list of chores because mom said they didn't want to waste food and dad said it was rude to cook for only one person. And I didn't mind cooking for everyone. But they were so fucking ungrateful. My siblings and parents alike. Complaints I got were: Too spicy, wanted potatoes instead of rice, wanted rice instead of noodles, wanted beef instead of chicken, wanted something plain instead of spicy, wanted no veggies, wanted a more veggie focused meal, wanted lasagna instead of pasta bake, didn't want soup, didn't like the flavor of soup, didn't want something sweet, wanted something sweet, changed mind and wanted meat well done, wanted more kinds of potatoes and the list goes on. None of this was constructive either. It was whining and complaining and I did start out asking what I should do but everyone wanted something different and I'm still in school!! I can't spend 6 hours cooking dinner on a school night so my siblings can have pizza, fries, nuggets, tacos and my parents can have steak and potatoes and gravy and all the trimmings or none of the trimmings but five different kinds of potatoes. I even made a weekly meal plan for a while and they wouldn't complain until after they ate it. I spoke to my family about the way they were behaving and my mom told me that's the reality of cooking for a family. She said my siblings and dad had always been like that with her. I pointed out I hadn't been and she just said that and she said yeah but it's part of life. I told her so she decided to treat me worse than I treated her and she told me I was being difficult and I told her no, she was taking everyone else's behavior out on me. A few times my dad or one of my siblings would say I wasn't a very good cook and they hated eating my food. So I said I wouldn't cook anymore and dad and mom would get pissed and my siblings would call me lame. So I stopped cooking for them. I cook just for me again and my parents are furious. They all come home hungry and I have nothing ready for them. Not even my siblings. My parents told me it's disrespectful and I cannot continue and I said they were all the disrespectful and ungrateful ones shitting all over what I made for them. They told me I shouldn't be okay with letting them go hungry and I said they all deserve to go hungry. My parents said it was a disgusting attitude and they grounded me for two weeks. AITA?",

        "selftext": "This post is about my son and Amy (my DIL) they have been married for about ten years and have two kids. They are 10 and 6. At the beginning I really tried to get along with her but she made it difficult. She is not very sociable, and always put her own mom over seeing her husbands side of the family. This is really apparent with holidays and the kids. She always choses to go to her moms for holiday even if I do it on an early day or late day. If I offer to babysit she always tells me she asked her mom or she would get back to me. The time I do babysit or get to hang out with the grandkids she is criticizing everything I do. Usually saying that not how her mom or how she does it. At the beginning my son was trying to fix this but gave up. We see him separately from his wife and kids. I truly don\u2019t understand it and I have asked if I did anything wrong but no answer on that. I gave up trying when my other son had kids. It is so much better and I have a great relationship with my other DIL and the kids. The kids are 9 (Ava my step-grandaughter) and 4 (grandson) I gave my Ava a family necklaces, that was my mothers. She loves it and has been wearing it everywhere according to my son. That also includes school which started this issue. My DIL called me up and asked why Ava got a family necklace but her daughter (10) didn\u2019t get one. I told her I just wanted to give it to Ava.  She got angry and told me I was playing favorite and that her daughter is older so she should have gotten the necklace. I told her that yes I am playing favorites and  it is due to her. I pointed out that I do not know her daughter because of her. That her kids will not be getting any of my family stuff because of her.  This was a huge argument and she called some a jerk and wanted me to give her kid a necklace. I am doubting myself on this ",

        "selftext": "My son \u201cGeorge\u201d just turned 13 this month.  George is very bright, projected to get 8s or 9s in his GCSEs, and regularly achieves these grades in his mock exams and assessments. But he struggles socially and has been bullied badly in the past. Things are better now, but he isn\u2019t popular.  As part of his PD class, he had to create a children\u2019s toy and give a sales pitch to the class. Last Friday was the presentation day, and George was really excited. He\u2019d put a lot of effort into his toy and the presentation. But I got a notification saying George had been given a C3 (after-school detention), something he\u2019s never received before. As he\u2019d refused to participate in class and didn\u2019t do his presentation. When I picked him up, I could tell immediately that he was upset. I asked him what happened and why he didn\u2019t do the presentation. He said he didn\u2019t refuse the presentation; when it was his turn, he asked to go later. His teacher said no, and that he had to do it then or get a C3. George said he \u201ccouldn\u2019t do it now,\u201d but didn\u2019t explain further when asked, so he was given the C3. I kept pressing him, worried that maybe he was being bullied again. Eventually, he told me the real reason: he had a random erection just before his turn and, no matter what, it \u201cwouldn\u2019t go down\u201d. With that info, I think George\u2019s request was perfectly reasonable. He didn\u2019t refuse to do the presentation\u2014he simply asked to do it a little later. Obviously, he didn\u2019t want to explain the reason in front of the whole class when the teacher asked him. His mum was really angry with him for getting the C3. I explained what happened and said I didn\u2019t think George was wrong. I said I\u2019m not supporting the detention and would pick him up at the normal time. When I told his mum what happened, she looked disgusted and said something like, \u201cWhy did he even have one in class to begin with?\u201d I explained that random erections happen, especially in early puberty, and they don\u2019t always relate to sexual thoughts, which is what she was assuming. She replied, \u201cWell, I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s true,\u201d dismissing what I said. So I told her, \u201cYou might not be sure, but I am.\u201d She insisted we needed to present a united front, along with the school, and that by going against her, I was sending George the wrong message. I asked why her way of handling it was automatically right and why I should be the one to concede. It escalated into a big argument, which we haven\u2019t had in years.  She\u2019s saying she is going to punish him for refusing when it\u2019s her week with him next week and that I am being an AH for \u201cgoing against her\u201d. Her mother text me saying I was setting a bad example for George by letting him get away with being disrespectful to his teacher. Which he wasn\u2019t even, just asked to do his presentation later. I respectfully told her she should mind her own business, and that George was my son.  But now I\u2019m worrying whether I\u2019ve done the right thing, and I need some outside perspectives. ",

        "selftext": "I (17m) might be TA and I might be a big one but I wanted to get people's insight. So my dad left my mom when I was 14 to be with his wife/the woman he was cheating on my mom with. My dad didn't want me to think badly of him but I did. He knew I did and he knew he couldn't change my mind easily. We always knew my parents would end up with shared custody until I was 17 at least (from experience the judges in family court will only stop enforcing shared custody when a kid turns 17 and speaks out, any younger and they insist on 50/50). I also knew mom would struggle on her own because while she did work, she never made as much as my dad. She also wouldn't get child support because of the 50/50 and it wasn't ordered even with the difference in income. So when dad pleaded with me to give him a chance to show he could still be a good dad and he said he would do anything for me, I told him to keep supporting mom and make sure she wasn't going to end up struggling while he got off easy. I told him she deserved that at least, after what he did, and that I deserved to see my mom doing well. My dad agreed and he paid it as child support instead of spousal support or whatever it's called. It really helped mom and she actually went back to school so she could get a better job. Dad is still paying that money. He knows I appreciate him doing it and he also knows it's one of the only reasons I didn't just decide to say fuck him and never want a relationship again. My mom is also less stressed. She has mixed feelings about my dad giving her money when legally he doesn't need to. But she also knows this is the only way for me not to feel the need to help support her. Where my dad's wife comes into it is this. She never liked that my dad paid this child support. She never liked that I insisted on it for my dad and I to have a relationship. But now my dad's house is struggling a bit and some changes needed to be made. His wife's son and daughter were in dance, football, softball, karate, music lessons and an art class as paid extra curricular's. My dad and his wife also have a baby together. The wife's kids had to cut two activities because they can't afford it anymore. It pisses his wife off because if dad wasn't paying the money they could still afford those things. She told me I should stop obligating my dad to support mom because they need it more and my mom isn't their problem. I told her she and her kids are not my problem. She told me they're my family while mom is not her or her kids' family or my dad's anymore. I told her she and her kids are dad's family but not mine. She told me they need all of dad's money right now before more things need to be cut back on. I shrugged in response. She told me I was so callously flippant and it wasn't a good look to care so little about my siblings lives (only one of her kids, the baby, is technically my half sibling). AITA?",

        "selftext": "I rent my basement suite out to my mom's best friend's daughter, Sally. I knew her growing up and I used to babysit her.  The basement has two means of escape other than going into my area. It is fully up to code as an in-law suite. There is no reason for anyone to go through it into my space. I went on vacation and I left my door to the basement deadbolted. Three days into my vacation I get an alert on my phone that there is an unauthorized event at my house. I look at the video. It's my mom opening the door for Sally's mom. They freak out when the alarm goes off. Usually if I need my mom to get into my apartment I will give her a temporary code. It is always the same one because she gets confused by tech. But I have to activate it beforehand. I cannot do it retroactively. The only choice would be to call her and give her my personal code.  I checked the cameras in the house and strangely enough my house is not on fire. I didn't leave the faucet running. There is no emergency.  This is where I might be the asshole. Once I saw they were just fucking with my area for no good reason I put my phone on airplane mode and went back to the party.  Maybe 90 minutes later a concierge at the resort came and said I was urgently needed on the phone. My dad has written down my whereabouts and they called the front desk for me. I excused myself and went for the call.  I asked my mom what the emergency was, why was she getting me out of my friend's wedding reception, was my house okay, was my dad okay. She very brusquely told me to shut up and talk to the cops and the security patrol.  I talked to them and apologized for wasting their time. I asked them what the emergency was that brought my mother into my house. They handed her back the phone and let her tell me that her friend did not want to sit in the basement while she was visiting her daughter. So my mom agreed to come let them use my area and it would be a secret.  I asked the security company to please lock my house back up and take my key back from my mother. She started to protest but I hung up.  I enjoyed the rest of my trip and my dad has agreed to pay any fines or penalties that come from the false alarm.  Sally's mom wants her to move out. That's fine by me I don't need a tenant and was only doing it as a favor. Sally is almost apoplectic begging me not to kick her out. She said that she didn't even know what our moms were up to until the alarm went off.  My mom is pissed that I wasn't available immediately to get them out of trouble and she is furious that I won't give her back my key. She thinks I did it on purpose. I'm not sure how she thinks I forced her to break into my home without permission.  So am I the asshole for making them sweat until they got ahold of me? And taking my key back since I can't trust her now.",

        "selftext": "I (33F) received a terminal diagnosis earlier this year. I\u2019ve got a couple of years at best estimate to get everything in order before I won\u2019t have the cognitive ability to do so anymore. I\u2019ve been working with a lawyer and an end of life care social worker to make sure everything will go as smoothly as possible and my wishes will be respected. I also have a complicated family situation.  My parents were never married and my dad died when I was 12 of the same condition I now have. He never married so all his assets were put in a trust for me by my grandparents. My mom married after they broke up and had my half-brother (26M).  He is severely mentally disabled. He\u2019s a 7 year old in a grown man\u2019s body and even with all the resources they can get, he\u2019s very difficult to care for and my mom and step-dad barely get by most of the time.  They tried really hard to get legal control of my trust when I was living with them, but couldn\u2019t. I help out some when things are really hard, but I feel like my mom treats me like an emergency fund rather than her daughter and my step-dad has been bitter about the financial stuff (my dad was very successful and his family is well off) since even before my dad died. I don\u2019t talk to either of them about my life because they always get passive aggressive and guilt-trippy. I\u2019ve been trying to talk more with my mom now that I know I\u2019m on borrowed time. We\u2019ve never had a great relationship, but I wanted to try and resolve some of it. She\u2019s been much nicer to me and more concerned since the diagnosis, so I thought it was ok to open up a bit.  I didn\u2019t want her to be blind-sided or feel like she has to take on anything since I\u2019ve appointed another family member to be my medical and financial POA, so I talked to her recently about my plans. I told her that I know my half-brother is a full time job so I\u2019m having other people take care of my care so she won\u2019t be burdened. She was thankful for that, but then brought up how she always hoped that I would be the one to make sure my brother was taken care of when she was gone and that in a way I still would be. She would put whatever I leave behind into his care fund and would make sure he knows it\u2019s from his big sister. This is where I might be the AH.  I\u2019m not leaving anything to my mom or brother. I don\u2019t have kids, but I have been the favorite \u201cauntie\u201d to my best friend\u2019s two children for their entire lives. They are the light of my life and I spend a lot of time with them.  My BFF and I have been through a lot together. She and her husband have been the ones going with me to appointments and letting me crash in their spare room when I was too sick from meds to be home alone.  Whatever is left over after I\u2019m gone is going to the kids for college. I know it\u2019s money that could secure better care for my half-brother and take some of the load off my mom, but I feel like I want to help someone else now. Edit - Thank you for the best wishes. To answer a couple of questions: (a) I am not at all close to my half-brother, I didn\u2019t really meet him until my dad passed and the 6 years I spent around him were painful and frightening. I haven\u2019t seen him in person in 15 years. It\u2019s not clear that he even understands that he has a sister or what that means and I would be really surprised if he remembered me at all. So, it\u2019s not that I don\u2019t care - I care to the same extent that I would about the welfare of any random mentally disabled stranger - I just don\u2019t have any special interest or warm family feelings about him because we share DNA. I\u2019ve also already put a lot of money into helping my mom stay solvent to care for him, so there\u2019s an argument to be made that he\u2019s already received a reasonable share of benefit in life. As much as my mom refuses to believe it, I would never have accepted legal responsibility for him after her death. His dad has family that could step in if they were willing. (b) I am working with a good team already to get things in order. My estate lawyer is very good at his job and he and my financial advisor are prepared to firmly lock down everything once I\u2019ve made the final decisions about where my assets should go. I trust my executor. So, that side of things and the medical and logistics planning is being well taken care of, don\u2019t worry. I just have to make a few hard decisions that I didn\u2019t expect to ever have to make. Thinking about some things people have said in this thread, it may be just be time to end the sentence on my relationship with my mom and her family and move on. I\u2019ve always held out hope that she cared in her own way and that things could be better, but I\u2019m really tired and I\u2019m not sure I want to spend what\u2019s left of my time chasing it and trying to figure out whether she can even be trusted to manage any money I could leave to them. The SW offered to set up a few family sessions with a counselor that specializes in terminal family member issues, so I might let that be the weathervane.",

        "selftext": "Both me (33F) and my sister (27F) are caucasian latinas. However, she's always been more tan than me, a fact she's always been very proud of. For reference, my skin tone is close to Aubrey Plaza's, while hers is closer to Gina Rodriguez's. When we were younger, she would constantly talk about how European I looked compared to her, how my hair looked more blonde than brown (which no one ever agreed with), and how certain colors I liked looked awful on me due to my skin tone. I almost never said anything because I was six years older and had better things to do. Also, while I did have many insecurities, I never doubted I was beautiful. Fast forward to now, we both have kids. My husband is a little more tan than me, and both our children (8M and 3F) have the same skin tone as their father. My sister's ex (and baby daddy), however, was a very pale Swiss guy. My niece (5F) is a fair-skinned girl with dark blonde hair, while my daughter is more tan and has dark brown hair. Everyone agrees that both girls are beautiful, but their skin tones have always bugged my sister. She insists that both girls are equally tan, that her daughter's hair is light brown, and that my daughter spends too much time in the sun. Last weekend, we all had dinner at my father's place. My son brought his notebook and drew pictures of everyone at the table. He colored my daughter's skin a darker shade than my niece **(edit: orange for my daughter, light pink for my niece)**. He also gave my niece yellow hair and colored my daughter's hair black (he lost his brown pencil). When we showed us the drawings, my sister frowned. She said he was exaggerating his cousin's features, and that he could at least make her hair darker. When my niece said she loved the drawing, my sister told her it looked nothing like her, and insisted my son was doing this on purpose. Before the kids could get upset, I pulled my sister aside and told her she was being ridiculous. We had a (very small) fight in the next room. Near its end, I said something along the lines of, Listen to me. Your daughter is white. We're all white. You need to accept that and stop comparing the girls if you don't want (niece's name) to become insecure. We left shortly afterwards and none of the kids have brought anything up again. My sister is pissed at me. She told both our (divorced) parents about our fight. Our father thinks I shouldn't have commented on my niece's appearance, and wants me to apologize to my sister. Our mom thinks this is dumb (I agree), but says my sister is overreacting. AITA?",

Not just a couple of minutes late, usually 20-30 mins or more and they don't ever tell us they are going to be late.  On Halloween they were supposed to be here at 6:30 to go trick-or-treating, my kids are teens so they already had plans but cancelled to spend time with them instead. At 7:15 we called and they said they were '5 mins away'.  22 minutes later, they arrived without any concerns.  This inspired a new rule for me, I called it the 5 min rule. Basically, if you tell me you're gonna be somewhere at a time and aren't, after 5 mins I will leave. If we are meeting to eat or something, and you're late, we will order and eat without you, we will leave when we finish even if they are just getting there.  Tonight they had plans to take my kids out for dinner, they said they'd be here at 7. We talked at 2p and I reminded them of the new rule. At 7:05 they weren't here and had not called or anything, so I called them. They said they were 10 mins away. I told them to not bother with it, they tried to ask me to give them another chance  since they live an hour away, and I said no way and stuck to it.  I feel like they are disrespectful by doing this and that they aren't valuing my time. AITA?",

        "selftext": "My husband and I are slightly more well off than my sisters family. Because of this my parents do more for them than they do us. When it comes to gifts my daughter (Maddie 7) get things from the dollar store while my nephews get whole Lego sets, iPads and even Disney trips. If my sister needs babysitting they will drop everything for her last minute. If I need it I have to give them a two week\u2019s heads up as well as proper payment.  Because of this clear favoritism my daughter doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with them. If you as her about her grandparents her mind automatically goes to my husband\u2019s parents because she forgets that she has two pairs.  Earlier today we having a rare meet up with my parents. My daughter asked if she can go on the trampoline outside. My dad said no because it\u2019s for my nephews. My daughter begged but dad still said no. Maddie then stomps away and said this is why I like other grandma and grandpa more. My parents looked at me expectantly but I didn\u2019t do anything. I recently got off a call with my mom saying I should have told Maddie that was wrong to say. I told her what do you expect she thinks y\u2019all hate her and y\u2019all do nothing to dispel those thoughts. She just got quiet for a bit then said I still shouldn\u2019t let her say something like that to family and hung up.  My husband is on my side but he also isn\u2019t a fan of my family so I need an outside opinion AITA?  Edit: to make some of you feel better we don\u2019t bring her around them often she only sees them on holidays with the rest of our extended family.  We were only visiting today to get something I was left in a will. As for babysitting I have only asked twice in extreme emergencies and they said no. I have talked to them about this but they say it\u2019s not favoritism she just needs less help because we are better off.  Update: just got off the phone with my uncle. Apparently dad called him ranting about how disrespectful we are.  Apparently this all stems from me going to college. Dad said since I had to be all hoity toity and go to college I shouldn\u2019t need his help and I should be living the easy life. He also said I\u2019m selfish for trying to take help away from those who need it. Not sure what to think about all that he\u2019s never brought up having a problem with that before. I\u2019m going to discuss this with the rest of the family because with the holidays approaching I don\u2019t want to cut everybody else out to avoid them so I\u2019m going to ask how they feel about all this.",

        "selftext": "My (M51) wife (F48) and I have two children: Jake (M23) and Jess (F18).  Although they had the same upbringing, Jake sadly surrounding himself with the wrong people during his late teenage years and made some bad life decisions. Since he was around 17, he's suffered with substance abuse issues and alcohol dependency. He's been through counselling on more than one occasion, and I've lost count of the amount of times that either my wife or I have had to make personal sacrifices to go and tend to him. He's currently living in a Recovery Housing Program, where we hoped he would see improvements. This has caused understandable issues for Jess. I've missed hockey games and choir performances because I had to go tend to Jake, as has my wife. We try and make it up to her at the time, but I don't think missing important milestones really makes up for it; it's heartbreaking for me personally.  Jake has been doing better lately, and he hasn't had any relapses or issues for the past few months. Jess' graduation was the other day, and my wife and I had tickets and couldn't wait. She's off to college, graduating with a great GPA and we're really proud of her.  However, only a couple of hours before the graduation, we received a call from the staff at Jake's Housing Program, who said that he had a relapse incident and was in a really bad way. My wife was hysterical and immediately started telling me we had to go there and help. I refused. I said that we'd missed enough events in Jess' life, and I wasn't missing her graduation. Although my wife told me how sad she was to miss it, Jake's health and wellbeing would take priority. I wasn't changing my stance. She got increasingly agitated and said she'd go herself, called a cab, and went. I took the car and watched Jess' graduation. It was one of the proudest days of my life, but when I saw Jess at the end, I could tell she was visibly upset that her mom wasn't there. I explained and you could tell her frustration. My wife made it to our celebratory dinner later, and she apologized, but the mood was sour. The incident with Jake was serious, but not a life threatening emergency, and he has been admitted into treatment.  My wife gave me the cold shoulder later saying how we should have been on the same page, been there for support, and that I'd been selfish. I disagreed, saying she'd been selfish in this scenario, and she tainted Jess' moment. This went on for a while, and I ended up sleeping on the couch.  I still feel I made the right decision, but I know I hurt my wife, and Jake's recovery is obviously of paramount importance as well. AITA?",

        "selftext": "Hey Reddit, I (26F) need some serious perspective. I\u2019m starting to think I might be the asshole, but I still feel like I\u2019m in the right lol. Every New Year\u2019s Eve, my family has a big party at my aunt and uncle\u2019s house and every year, without fail, I end up being the DD. Don\u2019t get me wrong I love my family, but it\u2019s starting to bug me. It\u2019s been like this since I was 19, even before I was legally allowed to drink. I don\u2019t drink much\u2014maybe a glass of wine or a beer, but I don\u2019t get plastered. I\u2019m fine with driving people home if they need it, but for the past few years, everyone expects me to not drink so I can drive them back. Every year, it\u2019s the same: \u201cOh, can you drive? You\u2019re not drinking anyway!\u201d I always say yes because I don\u2019t want to let anyone down. Fast forward to this year\u2019s New Year\u2019s Eve. I told my family ahead of time I wasn\u2019t going to be the DD anymore. I just wanted to enjoy the night, have a couple of drinks, and not be responsible for getting everyone home. I even told my cousin who usually gets really sloshed that I wasn\u2019t driving this year, and she was fine with it. When I got to the party, it was the usual chaos. People were drinking, laughing, and having a good time. I was enjoying myself, but around 11, my cousin came over and asked if I was ready to drive everyone home. I reminded her I\u2019m not driving tonight, I\u2019m here to enjoy the party. She looked at me like I was crazy and said, \u201cCome on, you always drive! Don\u2019t be a bitch.\u201d Which like, wtf? I tried to explain calmly that I wasn\u2019t being a bitch, just that I wasn\u2019t going to be the chauffeur anymore. Then, my aunt overheard and pulled me aside. She lectured me, saying, \u201cWe all agreed last year you\u2019d be driving. You know how much we rely on you. Everyone else is too tipsy, and Ubering is so unsafe. Just drive this one time, for the family.\u201d I felt a ton of pressure but refused I told her I\u2019m not their chaufeur and wasn\u2019t going to do it again just because no one else could figure out their own ride. My aunt got upset, saying I was being selfish and that we\u2019re family. She said I\u2019m the only one who doesn\u2019t get \u2018too drunk,\u2019 so it makes sense for me to help out. I told her I had already had three beers, so I wasn\u2019t even legally supposed to drive myself. That\u2019s when I snapped. I told them it\u2019s not my job to be their DD every year just because I\u2019m the only one who doesn\u2019t get blackout drunk. They needed to figure out their own rides this time. Then I got up and left. I felt bad walking out, but I didn\u2019t want to be a doormat anymore. I spent the rest of New Year\u2019s Eve at home, watching Netflix and eating leftover pasta with my boyfriend. My family texted me, calling me dramatic, selfish, and saying I ruined the night. They said I was being \u201csuper sensitive\u201d and that everyone was \u201cdisapointed\u201d in me. Everyone's demanding an apology out of me even now. And by the way, I got home perfectly safe by Uber. But anyways, Reddit, AITA?",

Things have been going well and one of the great things is that Felix is a builder and so everything with the nursery went pretty smoothly pretty fast! We agreed at the start what kind of vibe we wanted to go with it and it's pretty much already done. Figured that we'd get it sorted as soon as possible so it wasn't another thing to worry about later. My MIL has always been a bit of a nightmare but has been better since the news that I'm pregnant (though not without issue - for example, she told me that I should lose some weight and that it wasn't heathy for me or the baby. She knows that I used to struggle with anorexia and I'm not any sort of unhealthy weight). In the past I've kept my mouth shut and let Felix deal with her. As the nursery has almost been completed, she's suddenly decided to invite herself around more - I work from home currently, she comes in on the regular, asks me when I'm going to have lunch and oh could you just pop me something in too! and then will wander into the nursery and start rearranging things. I know this sounds stupid but once she literally bought an IKEA bag full of stuff that she put in there. It doesn't match. But I've never said anything really beyond, Oh, thanks so much for the thought etc. Yesterday when she came around uninvited, she looked me up and down and said Really? Joggers? Thank god Felix isn't here and then walked into the nursery and started asking me where the pillow she'd put in the crib had gone, why I'd taken out the fairylights hanging on the wall right by it, etc. I explained that they were potential safety hazards to the future baby and that I'd taken them out. She started with, Oh, well, *I've* had three children and I really think you should take more of my advice and then looked me in the eyes and said You're really not going to be a good mother at this rate. I don't know if it was the pregnancy hormones but I just stared at her for a moment and then told her to get out of the house. I'd been up all night and had loads of work and wasn't in the mood. She got very uptight about it and then left. Felix says he's going to talk to her and tell her that she shouldn't be reorganising anything without our permission, but I don't know if it was just the hormones and I'm being unreasonable. AITA?

(Management has told her off more than once for this)  About two weeks ago she was upset because a customer yelled at her and said \u201cDon\u2019t call me that!\u201d when she called her \u201choney\u201d and she complains that she\u2019s not getting as many tips as the other servers. She says it\u2019s because she has a southern accent and customers think she\u2019s stupid, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case.  She asked me for advice, and I said it\u2019s because she takes so long to bring things out and wastes time trying to make small talk. I also said that the excessive pet names sound kind of condescending, and they aren\u2019t really something you would call a stranger here.  She told me that she wasn\u2019t going to start being rude to customers because she would make even less money. I told her it\u2019s not being rude, it\u2019s just how things work here, and it\u2019s rude to other customers she\u2019s supposed to be serving when she spends all her time trying to make small talk instead of doing her job and calling them weird things.  Now she\u2019s mad and has been avoiding me. Maybe I could have been gentler when trying to explain why people complain about her, but I was also really stressed because it\u2019s Christmas season and so much is going on  AITA? ",

My family was small, me, my husband, daughter, parents, brother, wife and  2 nephewsv(edited) . Their loss was devastating for my life and for everyone, even worse for my father and my SIL.  1 year ago, my daughter, Betty (25F) was proposed by her fianc\u00e9 and preparations began. During this process, they chose the date based on the day they met (added:7y ago ) and that day is exactly 2 years since the death of my brother and nephew. I tried to talk to her about moving, because it is still a very difficult date for our family and even for myself, but she insisted saying that the venue had that date available and it would be perfect, because all the other available dates aren't so good and wouldn't be so important. I respected her decision.  Recently, she sent the invitations to everyone and, as I predicted, my SIL, my nephew (24M) and my father responded that they would not attend and despite not telling her, my father and SIL told me that the date choice was sound an offense to them. I decided to remain neutral at some point, I confirmed my presence and my husband.  Today my daughter called me unhappy that no one but us confirmed (my husband doesn't have family on his side) and her family part was empty and she expected everyone to go on that date, even more so after she explained the reason to them abou the date, but they still refused.  I tried to be supportive, but I said Love, this date is difficult even for me, but I will go to your wedding, but you have to understand that this choice of date had this consequence and you would have to deal with the consequences of your choices.  She exploded at me, saying that everyone was against her, it's not her fault the dates coincided and everyone could make an effort to go a few hours for her, but they decided to just not go and I was basically saying I told you so.  She hung up without me answering and we still haven't spoken.  My husband said he understands me, but I should have stayed away from it  AITA?",

        "selftext": "Growing up, my dad stayed at home while my mom worked. While my mom financially provided for my sister and myself, she was emotionally hands off. She came to a ballet recital here and there but didn\u2019t want to help with homework, didn\u2019t want to listen when we needed advice, etc. Our dad did 95% of the emotional labor. I later found out from my mom that my dad was the one who wanted kids. She loved her career and didn\u2019t mind providing financially but she did not want to do any of the stuff related to raising us outside of that. I am very grateful she provided for us financially, but I do admit it hurts that she wasn\u2019t there when we needed her. She was physically present but not emotionally present. EDIT: as this has come up, to be clear, the arrangement was my mother\u2019s idea, not my father\u2019s. That being said, I do agree that my father was equally as selfish for making this arrangement.  My dad always did grand gestures for her. Mother\u2019s Day was always a big deal with a huge brunch, flowers, gifts. She was spoiled. She did nothing for him on Father\u2019s Day. He had to do everything for himself until my sister and I were old enough to do stuff for him. I get that was the arrangement they had but I know it made my dad sad. I once asked why he didn\u2019t get the same hoopla our mom got and he just sadly said \u201cfather\u2019s day isn\u2019t as important as Mother\u2019s Day.\u201d As adults, my sister and I have tried to rectify it. We do Father\u2019s Day up big and our dad loves it. We grill for him just how he taught us and throw a huge BBQ with some other family members. However, we\u2019ve turned Mother\u2019s Day very lowkey. We still celebrate our mom but she usually gets a quiet lunch at a restaurant of her choice and a few gifts. After my mom ended up skipping my sister\u2019s baby shower this year because \u201cshe didn\u2019t see the big deal with someone having a baby\u201d, my sister wanted to do nothing for her. We sent gifts but spent Mother\u2019s Day with each other, our husbands and our own kids.  My mom told us after Father\u2019s Day that she was hurt we didn\u2019t do more for her in recent years. I said that since she put in almost no emotional labor into raising us, we are putting none into her. She said that our father and I had an agreement. I pointed out that yes, but we never agreed to it and it want fair that we grew up with an emotionally absent mother who didn\u2019t want us.  And to be fair, we have had this conversation with our dad as well and he admits it wasn\u2019t fair to us either. I also said if she didn\u2019t want kids, then why should she be celebrated as a mom? My mom is upset with both of us and called us ungrateful brats. My dad feels bad for her but supports our choice. AITA?  EDIT: To those asking how I\u2019d feel if my dad were the one that acted like this/how I feel about dads who do this in general: they suck just as much and it\u2019s not fair to the kids, regardless of whatever agreement spouses come to. This is not gender specific. While some people may have a gender bias, I do not. ",

        "selftext": "My mom, her husband and I (16f) are in group therapy with each other. We started therapy a few weeks after Father's Day, because that was the final straw for them to insist we all needed therapy to work on why I won't let us be the family they want. We started at the end of July and by the end of August my mom accused me of lying, called me a liar and laid out this really big sob story about how much it hurt to have me lie to her and do everything in my power to destroy her marriage. It pissed me off so bad. I didn't lie at any point of this. I said as much in the follow up session and the therapist asked me to outline my side and how I felt having mom call me a liar. My mom kept trying to interrupt me, she told the therapist the shut up and she accused me of being a vicious liar then. To give some explanation about the situation. My mom and her husband got married 3 years ago. They moved in together 2 months before. Before moving in they sat me down and asked me if I was okay with us moving in together and making a family of three again. Mom brought up how we'd have a man around the house again (my dad died) and how good it would be for her to have a husband and for me to have a dad and he said he couldn't wait to be my dad and he always wanted to be a dad. He said he already had plans for us for Father's Day. This was February of three years ago. I told them I wasn't okay with that stuff. That I didn't want another dad, wouldn't let him be my dad, and was not about to spend Father's Day celebrating someone who isn't dad. They started laughing and proceeded as normal but Father's Day became a struggle because I have not spent the day with him the last three years and he has tried, so has my mom. I meant what I said. I never called him dad or let him fill the role in my life. This year he snapped and he had a temper tantrum and said I was supposed to be with him on Father's Day and not spending the day alone and he didn't sign up to be nothing to me. My mom called me a liar because she said I promised to develop a close relationship with her husband and that I said yes to wanting what they asked. She said I had said I would give him Father's Day and I lied and I have not followed through on any of it. She said I made them think I would be a willing participant and I wanted us to be a family. It pisses me off because I never said what she claims and I even repeated what I had said back then.  The therapist couldn't get mom to apologize and she has no control over the sessions where my mom and her husband dominate. So I'm totally silent and I zone out. They only realized this two weeks ago. They called me on it and I spoke up again after more than a month of no talking in therapy, to confirm I wasn't listening and it came up last week and I said I was done engaging because I was owed an apology for being called a liar. My mom and her husband are pissed that I'm wasting everyone's time letting therapy happen.  AITA?",

My parents have relied on me heavily to take care of my siblings. Started when I was still too young to do much but they'd put them in my room if a nightmare happened and after each sibling was 6 months old they started sharing a room with me until they were 3. Then it was getting me to prepare something to eat for my younger siblings. It was also staying home with them while mom went shopping and over time it evolved. I help with homework, I make sure they're awake for school, I walk them to school since I don't have a car, I feed them and most of the time I'm the one they come to if they need help with something. My parents will drop them off at birthday parties or to friends houses. They'll take us out for family experiences but admittedly expect me to keep an eye on my siblings. My parents provide the food and house and clothes. I provide the emotional stuff. I don't love doing it but I got so used to it that it became second nature. I'm still the person my youngest sister comes to if she has a nightmare or is afraid of anything during the night. My parents learned they were pregnant again in February. They told me and my siblings last month. It was very much talked about like I will have the baby with me, in my room, for the jump and should learn how to independently change diapers and stuff. I made it clear from the jump that I wasn't raising their next kid for them. I told them I had more responsibility to my three siblings than I should've ever had. But I wasn't going to skip my own life to raise an infant from the start. My parents were shocked. They tried to get one of my younger siblings on board but they said no way, they didn't want to be responsible like me. My parents returned to me with the topic and asked what the fuck they're meant to do and they never expected me to reject a sibling like this. I said I reject child raising another one of *their* kids. Not a sibling. But also, I'll be out of the house in 7 months. I won't be around the new sibling as much and the relationship might not be the same. I told them I don't want the same relationship either. I don't want to be a parent to another sibling. They made it pretty clear they don't want to do the actual child raising and they're living a nightmare over this. When the topic came up during the last week I told them they need to place the baby for adoption since they won't have a good childhood with nobody wanting to raise them. I told my parents it would be the kindest thing to do if they refuse to raise the baby themselves. My parents accused me of treating adoption flippantly and they were sorta outraged I would rather they place the baby for adoption than for me to step up and raise this one too. AITA?",

        "selftext": "I 25F am an electrician. I started my apprenticeship at 17 and was hired immediately by my sponsor after I received my license. The reason I chose a trade was that I grew up in a trailer with my mom and sister, and I have wanted to own a house since I can remember, and being in the trades gave me access to a stable job and access to more money sooner. My partner, 29F, Thea, is a plumber, and we have scrounged and saved. In the end we bought land and built a tiny house in the uptown area of our city. It has two bedrooms and one bathroom, one of the bedrooms is our reptile room, as I keep snakes and Thea keeps bearded dragons. We are child-free and happy in our home. My Sister Lucy 34F, is a waitress and has three kids (M4, M3, M2). Her husband just left her for a woman my age and she is left without his income to raise all three kids on her own. Her husband bought out her half of the house during the divorce and that left her and the kids living with my mom in the trailer. I can admit I didn't grow up in the safest of areas and was carrying a knife when I was a teenager because of the danger. Because of the safety issue, Lucy came to Thea and I and begged us to let her and her sons move in. She said we would have to get rid of our reptiles or keep them in our room, her sons could have the other bedroom, and she would sleep in our kitchen on an air mattress. She said nothing about paying us rent or helping around the house. I told her no, because two toddlers and a little kid who is about to start kindergarten aren't suitable to be in our home and we don't want too many people in our house. She said that we live in a better part of town with better schools and that she needed the help. I told her we didn't have the room and that I was sorry, but I could hook her up with some journeymen I know and she could get started on an apprenticeship that pays better than her current job if she needed extra money. She called my job and Thea's job Dirty blue collar trash and left our home. She posted about how we wouldn't let her stay online, and now my relatives are messaging me about, How could I let a single mother and 3 kids be homeless, How they're your blood, and You owe your sister better than that. I feel like a complete asshole even though Thea told me I have every right not to want them in our house. AITA?   AFTER DINNER WITH MY XBIL EDIT: Thea and I went to dinner with my XBIL tonight. He brought his laptop and showed us all of the documentation.  1.) Lucy used her proceeds from the house to pay for her attorney, even though my XBIL offered to pay (timestamped e-mails to prove it)  2.) The woman living with him is his niece, not his AP, as Lucy claimed. (She came to the meeting; they have pictures and phone records showing that she is my XBIL's older sister's daughter.)  3.) LUCY CHEATED: ALL 3 BOYS AREN'T HIS. And DNA tests show that they all have different dads. So Lucy has been having multiple affairs.   4.) The 300 he is sending each month is a good will payment for allowing him to be a dad for a few years.   5.) Lucy isn't waitressing, she is working for Amway and another company called Sentsy in direct sales.  6.) Lucy won't do an apprenticeship because it doesn't fall under traditional gender roles (posts on a second social media account)  7.) Lucy has made homophobic posts on social media about me and my wife, and blocked us so we didn't see them. In the end... IDK what to think. ",

Usually the vacation is something that everyone can drive too, it was going to be the same until all the adults agreed the kids were old enough to leave the country. So now the trip is to Europe. Everyone has bought their tickets and I have booked where we are staying. Everything is getting finalized. My son and DIL were not in the family vacation chat since they weren\u2019t going on the vacation. They heard about the plans and want to be added in. She called me up asking about it and what they need to do. I asked her how she could get off work and she explained  she just could. I personally think she didn\u2019t want to go on the trip until she learned it was to Europe and lied to me that she couldn\u2019t come in the first place.  I told her it is too late, things are booked and I am not willing to pay more then I already have ( I paid for all the lodging, we would need to upgrade to fit two more adults). She asked if I was serious and that it is cruel to not include them on a family trip around Christmas. I told her it is what it is and its not my fault My son is pissed. He told me that I can afford to add two more adult, that is true. I reiterated what I told his wife. He called me a jerk\u2026 I want an outside opinion",

My ex and I were married for 12 years, and have been divorced for 5 years, we have three kids together who are now teenagers. My ex and I got divorced because we were young when we met and got married and we grew apart as people. It was a mutual decision, and we agreed our kids came first and have always coparented very well. This has been the case up until the last year when his girlfriend moved in with him. Previously we would do holidays and kids birthdays together, now when she is present they won\u2019t even sit near me at our kids sporting events. I have always been nice to this women, despite my kids expressing they do not like her and they feel their dad acts differently when she is around. My ex told me early on she wasn\u2019t a fan of me and felt I intimidated her. When I asked him for examples of how intimidated her, he said it\u2019s my fave, that I have resting bitch face and it makes her uncomfortable. My ex and her got engaged over Christmas and my kids were less than thrilled, my daughter especially. She feels her dad made a major life decision without even talking to them about it first. My ex called me yesterday saying he is giving me a heads up that I have a year to change my last name back to my maiden name as his finance is expressing her distaste and concern for her and I to have the same last name when they get married. I told him we agreed in our divorce that I could keep his last name until I felt the need to change it, and that is what is listed in our paperwork. I also told him I don\u2019t want to have a different last name than our kids. He said I\u2019m being unreasonable and refusing to see how this would make his finance uncomfortable. I told him I can\u2019t see it from her side because I am a grown up, and not an immature child like she is. He told me I could ask anyone about this situation, and everyone would agree with her.

        "selftext": "My (33F) daughter \u201cCleo\u201d (5yo) hates pink. She has disliked the color and almost everything to do with it since she was about three or so. She has one pink shirt she likes and one pink stuffed animal, and that\u2019s it. My father\u2019s partner, \u201cPrue,\u201d refuses to accept that Cleo doesn\u2019t like pink. Over the years, she\u2019s made several attempts to push the color onto her (pretty much every gift she\u2019s ever given her was some shade of pink), no matter how many times I tell her to stop. She has tried to give me dozens of different reasons why I should encourage my daughter to \u201ctry different shades.\u201d It clearly upsets Cleo, but Prue keeps doing it. About a week ago, my father invited me, my husband and our children for dinner at his place. He said he and Prue had a surprise for the kids. Right before we left home, my younger sister (who still lives with our father) texted me. She warned me that the \u201csurprise\u201d was actually a small birthday party Prue had planned for Cleo. That alone threw me off, because my daughter\u2019s birthday was in November. My father did miss her actual birthday party due to work, but still. Also, my son turns 9 in March, so I had figured his would be the next party we\u2019d have. Then she sent me photos of how the place was decorated, and it very clearly wasn\u2019t actually meant for Cleo. Literally every piece of decor was pink. The table, the tableware, the balloons, everything. She had gotten pink banners and glued pink foil fringe curtains on the doors. Even the cake was pink. I showed everything to my husband, and we agreed not to take the kids there. I texted my father the following: \u201cHey, (sister) told me everything. We\u2019re not coming. We\u2019re taking the kids to McDonalds and telling them that was your surprise. You and Prue can come if you want, we\u2019re paying.\u201d We did exactly that. My father did show up (without Prue), but he was cold with us and left 20 minutes after arriving. Both him and Prue are pissed. My father is angry that my husband and I dismissed his partner\u2019s \u201cheartfelt gesture\u201d towards our daughter. Prue also told me that I\u2019m the reason Cleo is \u201crestrictive\u201d (I also don\u2019t like pink), and I\u2019m raising her to be an ungrateful, spoiled brat who is unwilling to compromise. To be honest, I get how I could be in the wrong here. But at the same time, this just felt like Prue trying to push something Cleo doesn\u2019t like onto her yet again. My sister and one of my brothers are on my side (though my sister did say I had been rude). My other brother is on the fence. AITA? EDIT: My daughter doesn't know I dislike pink, nor would I care if she did like it. EDIT: I have written an update, as well as a separate post to sum up the comments I left here.",

        "selftext": "I (35F) met my husband Vince (36M) after he saved me from drowning at a pool party when I was 18. I took him out for lunch the following week to thank him for saving me, and we soon fell in love and began dating.  At the time, Vince worked a blue collar job while I was studying in university. We ended up getting married and Vince supported me throughout my entire education up until I got my PhD.  Vince always told me that he wanted to study in university but had learning disabilities that made it difficult for him to study in a classroom. At times he was embarrassed by the fact that he had to work twice as hard compared to people around him, but I always found that to be admirable about him.  When I finished my studies and got a well paying job I convinced Vince to give his dream of studying another go.  Last year he was finally accepted into a nursing program at our local university. He is working hard to achieve him dream and I\u2019m incredibly proud of him. Last week my friend Alba (36F) came to visit with her son so our children could play together. Alba was my roommate during my first year in university, she began dating her husband Leo around the same time I started dating Vince.  Leo was an obnoxious law student who later on became an even more obnoxious attorney. He was a know it all who prided himself on his intelligence, which for some reason attracted Alba.  At the time Alba would sometimes tease me that I could do better than Vince, and would offer to set me up with one of Leo\u2019s law school buddies, but I would always refuse and she eventually dropped the subject.  Alba and Leo are currently going through a nasty divorce that stems from him cheating on her, quite frankly he is dragging her through the mud and is using connections to try and leave her as penniless as possible.  As we were chatting and catching up Alba began to express concern over the fact that my eldest son (7M) was recently diagnosed with dyslexia, Alba began telling me how she is worried that my son will be academically challenged like his father and what that could entail for his future. Before I could respond she told me how I should have married someone smart while I had the chance so I would have kids like hers. (Albas son is an incredibly bright boy and a straight A student). I told Alba her advice was unnecessary and reminded her where marrying for intelligence got her, I then proceeded to tell her that I would rather have my son grow up to be an honest, hardworking person like his father than an academically gifted jerk who wasn\u2019t smart enough to know sleeping with his secretary could have consequences on his marriage like her husband.  Alba was deeply hurt by what I\u2019ve said and stormed out with her son. Some mutual friends are now chiming in and are telling me thatI was too harsh on Alba for using her failing marriage to prove my point and should apologize.  ___________ Small update: first of all I want to thank you all for your replies :)  I wanted to address a couple of things, many of you asked why Alba and I remained friends despite her previous remarks. Alba and I grew apart during our third year in university, we only remained friends by association since we have a lot of shared mutual friends.  We became close again after our sons started playing basketball together at the local community center and became friends. I figured that becoming a mother made her more mature and she didn\u2019t give me any reason to suspect otherwise.  I\u2019ve decided to send her a message saying that the way she spoke about my husband and son was unacceptable and therefore she is no longer welcomed in my home, however, I don\u2019t want our sons to lose their friendship and therefore I\u2019m willing to remain civil around the kids and still organize play dates. She didn\u2019t reply to me just yet, but I truly hope she loves her son enough to put her ego aside and remain civil for the sake of our kids. I\u2019ve yet to notify Vince about this entire situation since he is vigorously studying for an important quiz that\u2019s coming up next week, and I know that if he heard what Alba said about him and our boy it would make him upset and he won\u2019t be able to continue studying properly. Unless something crazy happens in the meantime I\u2019ll probably update him next week after he\u2019s done with the quiz. ",

The areas school district has a Facebook account that parents are a part of. I introduced myself on there a while ago. We put katty on the cross country team and she has been making friends over the summer. I got a message from a parent last week, asking to met up and let the kids met. They would be in the same grade and I thought it would be a good opportunity.  We went yesterday at the local pool. I met Melanie and she wouldn\u2019t make eye contact, was very soft spoken and overall didn\u2019t seem to be paying attention. The kids were playing while I talked to the mom. She has always been in the area and was excited her kid was getting a friend.  Katty came up to me asking to leave since she wasn\u2019t feeling well. We left early and in the car she admitted to just wanting to get away from Melanie. She explained that    Melanie freaked her out. She was very touchy, kept pushing her in the water, was whispering ( saying things under her breath), would stare at people and make comments (comparing people to bugs? I am still confused on what that means) Katty told me she was uncomfortable and doesn\u2019t want to hang out with her again. The parent messaged me, and asked when they could do it again. I told her the girls didn\u2019t mesh well and that we will have to decline. She then called me asking what I meant. I told her that katty wasn\u2019t interested in hanging out since they don\u2019t mesh together. I was trying to be polite about it. This went on for a while and she told me that they kids just needed to be around eachother more. I told her no to that. It\u2019s went on for a while, she asked to talk to my husband which is when I snapped. I told her, no and that I was trying to be polite but your kid is weird. Melanie makes my kid uncomfortable and I don\u2019t know what the hell is up with her but we will not have another play date. She went on Facebook and it going around about how the new family are jerks. It seems to not be going anywhere, but I am wondering if I was a dick",

I\u2019m older so I think a child should be grateful for whatever they get for free on Halloween and not expect special treatment for a disability when getting free items.

Back when I was in my twenties our great grandmother ended up with an illness which required someone to take care of her. This ended up being me as everyone else was busy with their lives and I have only recently graduated from uni back then. Due to this when she passed away I have inherited the house she lived in, which is a small 2 bedroom. I have lived there until I got married and me and my husband ended up moving to a bigger property. About a year later my brother asked if I'm willing to rent it out to him, which I agreed to do, but have warned him I will need it back when Caroline turns 18 (She was 3 at the time) since it is very close to universities and city center. Legal agreement was drafted for the rent (significantly below market value) so everything was followed by the book. About a year ago I have informed my brother about needing the house back as my daughter is going to be 18 and I would like to have some repairs done before she moves in. My brother ignored me, so I have issued him notice to vacate, which was also ignored. As he continued to ignore me, I had no choice but apply for a court order to evict them, with hearing taking place last month. Last week him and his family were officially evicted. Upon getting into the house I have noticed it wad in horrible condition and it would take a few months just to make it somewhat habitable, let alone do redecorating or repairs. I have raised this with my brother since he was meant to look after the house and let me know of any repairs, but this talk ended up in an argument where I was called an asshole for evicting him and his family so my spoiled daughter can live by herself and not giving them enough notice (they had just over a year to find something suitable). He also said I have inherited the house by cheating. My parents are on his side since Adam and his family live with them.",

I was pretty stoked about this, so I made a post on Instagram showing it off.  My stepmom messaged me and told me I should take down the post a few days later.

My stepsister did reach out, but her response was something like, \u201cwow, I had my son, all the hospital sent me was some maxi pads and a bill. :angryfaceemoji:\u201d I didn\u2019t down the post because I want to highlight the work that charity was doing. Especially for women in my area who may not be aware of the baby boxes and could really need it. My stepsister sent me a DM telling me to take the post down.

Two years after that we met, fell in love, got married, and had a kid. Unfortunately for me our son's birth was a catalyst for a regression for her.  He could do no wrong. If I tried to punish or even just correct him she would get upset and start crying or fight with me.  If he found something difficult and I wanted him to work through it or try harder she would step in and tell me to back off or actually just do it for him.  This lead to our divorce a I wanted to be a father and not a spectator. She fought so I wouldn't get custody. I ended up with visitation. My kid wouldn't do anything though. He wouldn't bring his homework over and all he wanted to do was play video games. If I didn't let him he had tantrums. It was exhausting. And she would always back him up. It was always my fault.  I remarried to my wife Diane. We have two children and are doing our best to raise them right. My son stopped coming over when he was 14. I still invite him but he rarely responds.  My child support just stopped. His mom has been giving it to him to do whatever he wanted for the last three years. Not my problem.  He called me to see if I could help him with money. I asked what for. He said that his mom can't give him the allowance he is used to. I asked if he was going to be attending some sort of post secondary school. He said no.  I told him to get a job.  His mom has lost her shit. She said she will take me back to court so her poor baby can live his life his way. I wished for the odds to be ever in her favor and hung up. Now that he is an adult I never have to talk to her again. It's too bad because I loved her very much. Not any more.  My son asked me to help him find a job. I said I would. I told him to send me his resume. I've been waiting three weeks for it. He called me yesterday to see if I had made any progress on finding him a job. I said he never sent me his resume. He got upset that I hadn't reminded him. It was one thing.  I told him that I was not going to motivate him to do anything, that I would be here if he needed help but that it would never be money again.  I let him come over and helped him with a resume. I also talked to him about the trades or a community college. He is beginning to understand how fucked his future is now that his mom cannot do everything for him. He is upset with his mother now because he doesn't have life skills.  She is mad at me for showing him the truth.  ",

I can\u2019t drive so I ran up the lane to call 999 it took forever to get signal and then it took forever for the ambulance to get to the house. I almost had to deliver the baby for fucks sake, she ended up giving birth in huge back of an ambulance. This whole time my brother had just disappeared. He finally turned up at the hospital about 8 bf hours after he disappeared. Apparently he\u2019d gone to our dad\u2019s house until our found out my sil gave birth and made my brother go see her.  I yelled at him outside the hospital for being so fucking stupid. He told me that he just got scared and didn\u2019t  know what to do. I told him that he\u2019s going to a shit dad if he keeps reacting like this. What\u2019s he gonna do when the kid gets injured and it\u2019s his responsibility to take him to A&E? Is he just gonna dump the kid and run off to dads again? He\u2019s such an idiot fucking hell. He started crying and called me a twat for being so mean to him. I just lost it with him, he was acting like a child when he should be comforting is fucking wife and apologising to her for being a dick. He called me a cunt and told me that I don\u2019t understand what he\u2019s feeling. I get that he was scared but he seriously needs to get a grip and help his wife. AITA?",

My husband and I are still working and will probably retire in 10-15 years. Around 70. My DIL and I got along much better before the kids came into the picture. They live 30 minutes away and she is always trying to drop them off. I thought my son was in on this but no. I sat them down and he had no idea this was happening. I showed the many texts asking for me to babysit and he was under the impression that I have only babysat twice this month not 16 times. Apparently she has been dropping them off with me to hangout with people and my son wa sunder the impression she was taking them with her I started to communicate in a group chat with them so everyone was on the same page. I only respond to her in the group chat and if she starts to spam me with texts about it I throw a screenshot in the group chat and have my son deal with it. We have talked and it comes down with her wanting her kids to have the same relationship she had with her grandparents. In short I explained that I am still working and I will not have that relationship. That I can\u2019t have the kids every other day just like she had growing up. We agreed to every two week to have a grandma day. All good for about a year, my son is now traveling for work and she is at it again. The time difference makes it hard to have him shut it down when I happens I was home for about an hour when she showed up at my home. She wanted me to babysit when she went shopping. I had enough at this point I told her for fucks sake I have my own life, that I will not be the cookie cutter grandma she wants and if she tries to leave the kids with me from now on without my agreement that I will call the police for abandonment. She called me a jerk and stormed off. My son called trying to smooth it over and saying I may have gone to far. Edit: for everyone going on about how he couldn't know, doesn't he talk to his kids The kids were 4 months and 1 3/4 years old when she kept dropping them off. They weren't really talking, the oldest sure could move but not a big talker  It really hit off when she was pregnant and got even worse when the second one was born ",

It takes about 20 minutes to drive to the restaurant so I planned to leave the house at 6:30pm to build in time for traffic and picking up my father. My husband (43 M) had decided to do a bit of work on his car about half an hour before we needed to leave. At 6:30 when the kids and I were waiting by the door, he was still doing it. He hadn't changed and hadn't showered. I told him to quickly get ready, but it got to 6:50 and he still wasn't ready yet so I decided to just leave without him. He has a habit of always running late when we go out and he is always the last one to be ready. Normally I can tolerate it since it only sets things back by ten minutes at the most, but my birthday dinner was important to me and I had been looking forward to it for weeks. Making us wait for 20 minutes was taking the mick, so I yelled out that we were leaving and left, because I didn't want to lose the table, since we would have arrived about 7:20. I called the restaurant to let them know we would be late and we luckily still had our table, but my husband didn't show up at the restaurant and when we got home he was mad at me. I told him that I was tired of him not respecting my time and always making people wait for him, and that he could have made his own way to the restaurant. My father agreed with my decision to leave without him, but my kids were a little upset that he wasn't there to have dinner with us. So, AITA?",

        "selftext": "So, my husband (38M) and I (36F) are expecting our first child, a bouncing baby girl due in a few months. We were both over the moon when we found out the gender, but now things have gotten . . . complicated, to say the least. See, when we first started talking about names, the \u201cboy name\u201d was immediately decided: Stuart Jr., after my husband. No problem there, it\u2019s a classic name and carries family meaning. But, for a girl, things got murky. My husband suggested Stuarta. No, you\u2019re not having a stroke. Apparently, his logic is that since Stuart ends in \u201ct,\u201d we can just add an \u201ca\u201d to make it feminine. I tried explaining why that doesn\u2019t quite work, how it sounds more like a furniture brand than a human name, how she\u2019d be endlessly correcting people and explaining its origin. He\u2019s adamant though, says it \u201chonors\u201d him while giving our daughter a unique name. I\u2019ve suggested alternatives: feminine names that maybe share a similar sound or meaning to Stuart, names he\u2019s mentioned liking in the past, even just going back to the drawing board entirely. But he\u2019s fixated on Stuarta. Now, I love my husband dearly, and I understand wanting to honor family. But I can\u2019t imagine subjecting our daughter to a lifetime of awkward stares and endless questions about her \u201cunusual\u201d name. I also worry about potential bullying and the impact it could have on her self-esteem. So, Reddit, am I the jerk for refusing to budge on Stuarta? Is there any compromise I haven\u2019t considered? Help a soon-to-be mama out! TL;DR: Husband wants to name our daughter after himself; in a really, really bad way. I think it\u2019s terrible and will set her up for a lifetime of awkwardness. AITA? Looking forward to your thoughts and (hopefully) some sanity checks! Edit: Please, no suggestions for other \u201c-ta\u201d names.

        "selftext": "I'm a single mom with a 4 year old daughter, Anna. Anna and I live with my mom. We both work and Anna goes to daycare full time. Daycare would be about half my income so I get a subsidy that covers $1400 out of her $2000 tuition. The only condition of the subsidy is that she actually has to show up. If she misses too many days I lose the subsidy. I go to work at 7:30 and daycare opens at 8 so my mom would be the one to take Anna to daycare.  Anna's main teacher is a 20/21 year old girl. When I've talked to her she's always been very animated and energetic. She's great with the kids. Anna always comes home saying this teacher brought stickers, she brought juice, she brought bubbles, she did face painting, etc. and always has fun crafts that she did with her teacher. This teacher is her favorite person in the world right now and Anna often runs away from my mom to jump on this teacher in the mornings and hides when my mom picks her up because she doesn't want to leave this teacher. My mom started to get jealous that Anna likes the teacher better than her so she started keeping her home from daycare on her days off/when she only has 1-2 easy clients (she cleans houses).  I found out Anna missed 5 days over the past 3 weeks. I asked my mom about it and she told me she wanted Anna to spend more time with family instead of with teachers I told my mom Anna needs to be in daycare unless she's sick or I would lose the subsidy. She was arguing that if Anna needs to be in daycare, she should be in one with more family values and not some rich white girl trying to save the poor kids (the teacher is a girl from a well off family marrying into a well off family and the daycare isn't in the most well off neighborhood.) She has bins full of clothes for the kids, gave everyone a water bottle with their name on it, has a much nicer classroom than the other teachers, and drives a car worth more than my mom and I combined could make in a year. She's setting up a field trip to the local airport so her fiance can talk to the kids about flying planes and so they can look at his jet. I told her I wouldn't. This is the best daycare that takes this subsidy and I won't be moving her just because she's jealous.  She was still insisting on Anna either being with family or being in a more family based daycare so I got her a babysitter. I drop her off to my neighbor at 7:30 when I leave for work and she drops Anna off at 8:15 on her way to take her kids to school. She only charges me $10 a day. I don't love the breakfasts that she gives Anna but I know she's going to daycare and I won't lose the subsidy.  Now my mom is pissed that I'm keeping Anna away from her.

Luke knows I\u2019ve been vegan since my 20s and it\u2019s never been an issue before. When I asked where he made reservations he said a local BBQ place that is famous here for having a menu that mocks people who don\u2019t eat meat, like literally has a section that says \u201cVegetarian options: don\u2019t let the door hit you on your way out\u201d. I asked what he expected me to eat, and he got huffy and said well it\u2019s his birthday so it shouldn\u2019t matter, I should eat before getting there and just order drinks while everyone else eats dinner and still enjoy everyone\u2019s company etc.  This sounds miserable to me. I had zero expectations of Luke picking somewhere vegan friendly, hell I expected him to pick a steak house and I would\u2019ve been fine with a salad and some sides, I didn\u2019t expect him to choose somewhere that prides themselves on meat being in every single dish on the menu.

I REALLY love their cheesecake (this becomes important later) Well everything was going fine and we were having a good time until an elderly man at the next table scooted his chair out just as our server was approaching, causing him to stumble and spill hot coffee on me( down my back). It was obviously burning and startled me so I instinctively screamed and pulled my shirt up.  I\u2019m pretty small chested so I don\u2019t typically wear a bra and obviously I wasn\u2019t thinking about that when something hot was running down my back burning me so I basically flashed all those at the tables around us. Yes I was embarrassed but at the same time it\u2019s just boobs. I pulled my shirt back down right after realizing what happened but it was up for about 15 seconds. The server apologized over and over but it wasn\u2019t their fault it was all just an accident.  Well anyway after this my bf wanted to leave, like immediately leave. He said that I was being overdramatic for the way I reacted in the situation and maybe I was but it did startle me really bad and it did burn. He told me I had put on a show for everyone in the restaurant especially since I screamed when it happened and that we need to leave.  I told him it\u2019s not that big a deal and that I really want to stay to get cheesecake because it\u2019s my favorite, I eventually even offered to try to get some to go and he was dead set that we need to leave and didn\u2019t understand why I wasn\u2019t mortified.  We ended up staying but for the rest of the date he kept saying that the men at tables near us were staring at me and probably thinking about me inappropriately but I said it wasn\u2019t my problem if they\u2019re being gross.  When we got in the car he told me i ruined our anniversary for making him sit through that and we should have just left and that he can\u2019t believe I would choose a piece of cheesecake over his comfortability.

        "selftext": "My older brother Jamie died 7 months ago. He was 20. Before he died he wrote a letter for me and another for our dad. His letter to me was him apologizing for leaving, saying he loved me, he wanted me to have a good life and things like that. Dad's letter was different. Jamie told dad we always knew he cheated on our mom, that he was disgusted to be his son, that he didn't tell him he was sick because he didn't want dad to fake grieve him like he did our mom, he didn't want dad's tears or anguish, that he felt like dad not getting the chance to say goodbye was justice for his affair, his affair child and for the hell he put the two of us through when we were so young and losing our mom. I only know the content of dad's letter because he told me about it and wanted to know if I felt similar in any way and I told him I did. My dad had other kids with his wife, the affair partner (or one of them?). My half sisters are 11 and 10 and my half brother is 8. I'm 17M because I know I didn't mention that. And the timeline was mom was sick for like a year. She died when I was 5 and my brother was 8. Dad was a dad again only 6 months after she died and his wife was living with us before that point. Dad never explained it to us. He relied on us being young, and boys, and not knowing enough about pregnancy to realize. My brother always kept his distance from our half siblings and he wanted no part of being their brother. I feel similarly but I'll try to be nice because we live in the same house. But now that Jamie's gone I feel like I lost my only sibling and I don't love or care about my half siblings or think of them as real siblings. Which might be why I'm resisting here but anyway. Dad knows I have a letter from Jamie. But Jamie didn't write anything to our half siblings. So dad wants to make a copy of the letter and make it look like it's to all of us (so edit it). He said ever since the girls found out I got one, they've been upset and they grieve for Jamie too and they don't deserve the weight of being unloved by their brother and knowing they'll never get to have a kind message from Jamie. He said Jamie never said I love you to them or hugged them or gave them any of his heart. And it's not their fault. But some of the pain can be eased if they think he thought of them. He said we'll just say I was being possessive of the letter and it was never just mine. I didn't agree to share the letter and I told dad I don't want him to edit it. He got really mad at me and asked me how I can have such a small age gap between me and my half sister, how I could live with them for 11 years and not want to save them from this. He asked me if I had become such a monster. AITA?",

I told her that if she pays for her sisters college then I will stop favoring her sister with my money. She called me a jerk, an isn\u2019t responding. Edit: According to my mothers partner, she had the money together in order to build it up more and was going to split it when my oldest went to college. She died before that. They are full sisters, same parents. ",

        "selftext": "My parents live in the in-law suit of my house. They pay rent to help me cover the mortgage but the house is completely mine. Their rent is $600 a month. That includes all utilities including internet and streaming services.  My older sister is pregnant again, yay, and she needs a place to stay as her baby daddy bailed out and moved back to Romania without her. My parents agreed to let her stay with them. They did not ask me but, like I said, they pay rent and can do as they wish with their living area. My parents have full run of my house except for my bedroom and my office. My dad likes to putter in the garage and plays with my dog.  My mom likes to bake in my kitchen and work in the garden. The basement has a kitchen but it is small and mine is just better all around.  Nope, they want me to babyproof my levels of the house. I asked why I would need to do this as the kids would 100% NOT be in my area. My mom said that it would not be fair to keep the kids cooped up in the basement all day. I said that there was a huge yard, and sunroom for them to spend time in if they really wanted. My sister said that she couldn't spend all her time cramped up like that with three kids. I asked when she found out she was having twins. She shut up. I dragged it out of them that she was planning on watching her friend's toddler for money. I said I did not have insurance for her to run a business out of my house. She said it was all under the table and that she needed money.  This was when I said that I would be taking the keys to my area back from my parents and I was also going to change the locks. I said that I agreed to let my parents live with me to help them out. They agreed to let her move in because she is an irresponsible wench that can't understand birth control. I never agreed to let her use my house as a day home. I know I do not want three kids here along with four adults. Well three adults and a pregnant dumbass. (I thought this but did not say it)  My mom is mad that I am going to lock them out of my area but my dad understands. The thing is I would let him keep a key but my mom would get it from him and she would give it to my sister. I said I would leave the garage lock the same and that was good enough for him.  My mom and my sister are upset and giving me the silent treatment. My mom got my dad to ask me if they paid for the insurance if my sister could watch her friend's kid. I agreed but I did say that they should get my sister to pay it. ",

        "selftext": "I rent out my house through a service that includes insurance when it is in use. The insurance does not cover when I lend my house out to friends and family since they are not paying. I have regular homeowners insurance for that.  My brother was using my house with his family just after New Year's. It's a slow time and I wasn't going to lose out on much income.  My nephew stayed up late one night and didn't go out for breakfast with his family. So he decided to make himself some food.  He started a kitchen fire. And he freaked out and called 911 instead of using the fire extinguisher in the kitchen. He is 14 so I can't blame him too much.  The smoke damage will cost about $8,700 to fix. I told my brother he could take his time paying me back. He said he wasn't going to pay for an innocent mistake.  I needed the house in order so I just fixed everything. I didn't go through insurance since I do not want my rates going up.  I was obviously upset so I posted about the fire and how pissed I was at my brother. Pretty much all my friends and family took the side of the innocent angel. They said it was unfair for me to expect that much money from him when he could have rented a hotel for 1/4 the price.  So I agreed. I said that from now on my house was off limits unless they rented it out or I was there and they came as my guests. Since I only use the house with my family that means they can rent it all or use the only empty bedroom. It has a twin bed and a crib.  Now the howling started that I'm being unfair to them for something that wasn't their fault. I offered to take up a collection from them to cover the repairs or the increased insurance premiums and most of them shut up.  I directed them all to my brother. He got quite angry at me for blaming him for the situation. I said I wasn't about to send a mob after my nephew.  I bought the house after I got a settlement from a worksite accident. I use the income to supplement the difference in what I used to earn at my old job and what I do now.  So I guess my question is am I the asshole for telling everyone who has a problem with me charging rent or stuffing a family into a room meant for two small children to talk to my brother about it.",

        "selftext": "There is a whole lot of unnecessary back story I will leave out.   I rented my parent's house after they retired and moved south. I paid slightly below market rate. The plan was for me to save up and eventually buy the house at a great price. They would then give that money to my brother as his part of their estate. My share was the subsidized rent and the very subsidized purchase agreement.  Everyone thought this was fair. Until my brother's wife started running up debts they couldn't cover.  This lead to them losing their home and needing help. I love my brother and my nephews so when my mom asked me if they could move in I talked to my husband and we agreed. We are in the process of adopting two siblings but we are still not there. It was only going to be temporary so why not.  Half off the rent for a few months would totally help us with the down payment and expenses. They moved in in February. When March rolled around I sent transferred half my usual rent to my parents. My mom called to ask me where the rest was. I said I assumed that Brad was paying the other half. Nope. I had to pay all the rent. I asked why I had to pay for them to stay in my house. My mom said it wasn't my house yet and that I was being mouthy.  I saw the writing on the wall. I paid the rent and started looking. We had a good amount saved up and we didn't need a big old house with lots of maintenance issues we had been handling.  We paid the full rent in April as well. But we moved out and into the house we closed on. It was ready for immediate possession. With my husband and I having decent income and 25% down it went smoothly. The only downside is the much smaller yard. But it is a block away from a public park so we aren't losing much.  I did tell my parents we were leaving. May first I got another call from my mom. She wanted the rent. I said I wasn't living there any more. She said I was breaking our deal. I said that our deal never included me paying for my brother's living expenses. She said  that they couldn't afford to cover the mortgage without my rent. I told her to get money from my brother. He was still working. She said he was trying to pay his debts. I said that his wife should get a job.  I could write a much longer post just on this discussion.  Long story short she said I was being cheap and viscous to my brother and to my parents.  We are settling in to our newish house and just ignoring them for a while. But I'm wondering about if maybe I'm wrong.  AITA?",

        "selftext": "I'm (16m) currently in family therapy with my dad, his wife, my sister (14) and stepsiblings (10, 9 and 7). This blended family thing is pretty new still with my dad being remarried for 2 years. My mom died so I only have one home. And I'll be honest I was never excited or really into the whole blended family thing. But I know that's not my decision. All three of my stepsiblings have food allergies, two have bad ones. So the way we eat changed a lot. This included places we eat at that were a part of traditions. For most of my life we'd eat at this local noodle bar in town for the end of the school year and whenever we had a school thing (play, graduation, report card, etc) and we're not allowed to go there anymore because of the allergies. Even just with dad it's a no go. We can't bring ice cream into the house anymore because my stepsiblings can't eat it. Only my dad and his wife can prepare food so no more making a sandwich for myself either. Birthdays have changed. My sister and I can no longer eat at our preferred restaurant of choice because of my stepsiblings and we can't bring my favorite dish into the house either. So now it's a place that my stepsiblings love and is acceptable for their allergies. For two years dad has talked about how glad we are to make all these changes and how family is worth it. About four months ago his wife noticed my sister and I weren't engaged with the family in the way she thought we'd be. We didn't want to talk to her. She also noticed my sister had cut me and her out of some photos of all of us and used just me and her for her room's art wall. So she and dad decided we needed some family therapy. Since we started about two months ago officially there has been a lot of what's the problem, why are we there, explain the problem. And my dad has also talked about all the good from a blended family and changes were mentioned and he talks about how happy we all are to make them. Well, last week I got so sick of it and the therapist asked me if I was truly okay with them. And I went off. I said no I'm not. That I hate the changes. That it's unfair. That I never said I wanted my stepsiblings to celebrate my birthday more than I wanted my favorite foods. That these things were decided for me. I said I never would have made that decision because celebrating with them isn't important to me. I'd rather have a good time with the people I love and enjoy food that I love instead. And that I hate not being able to make a sandwich or buy snacks after school. I basically went off for the whole session between a rant and answering questions the therapist put to me. My dad is so mad at me for doing it and his wife was really upset because her kids heard it. But she was also upset because she accepted on some level I didn't want this ever. She's also kinda mad that I took up a whole session with my rant. AITA?",

        "selftext": "My mom died when I (17m) was 5. My dad remarried when I was 8 and made a blended family with his wife and her two kids. Then they had two kids together so I have step and half siblings. My mom's family were a big part of my life for the first 6 years and then my dad and them fought because my dad had met his wife by then and he didn't like their reaction to the news. Essentially he wanted to invite them over for my grandparents yearly family BBQ and my grandparents didn't want to include them. They told him they couldn't accept my mom's replacement. He got mad at them for feeling that's what he was doing and he told them they could forget about seeing either of us again. He tried to keep me from them but they filed for grandparents rights and dad's lawyer said they'd win so he said I could see them once every three months for 4 hours. It was way less than I was used to but it didn't stop me being close to them. He invited them to his wedding and they didn't come. It pissed him off more and then he got super weird about it and he suddenly started demanding invites again for his wife's kids when I was invited and then when my half siblings were born, he was including them in the attempt to force my family's hands. But they never invited them. They did ask me if I wanted them there and I said not really. So they didn't change their mind. My dad always bitched about them whenever my visits would come around. He really hated that I went and my step and half siblings couldn't. He tried to tell me I should advocate for them all to be included. I never replied to him because it was easier not to. Once I turned 14 he got worse with that stuff and he'd complain that I was calling and texting them and that I kept in touch more than the once every three months. He'd tell me they hate my siblings, that he didn't want us to have our family. I told him that didn't upset me or make me mad and it didn't change that I wanted to see them. The day I went back to school (senior year) my dad told me since I was graduating in May and I'd be 18, he needed to make it clear that I will need to choose. Because I can't keep spending time with people who refuse to include most of my family and he told me I'll have to choose my family or them. I told him the them were my family and I'd choose them. He didn't expect the answer. He got pissed and told me I should always choose siblings over extended family. Then he acted like I hadn't given my answer because he told me when he and his wife throw me the graduation party that I won't be allowed to invite my mom's side. I told him he didn't need to throw me one because they would and I'd made it clear my choice will be them. Dad told me that isn't how it works. I told him it is because he gave the ultimatum and he needs to live with the consequences. He accused me of twisting his words and disrespecting him by throwing that in his face. AITA?",

        "selftext": "So I (21F) have been friends with Loreen (22F) for 17 years now and we\u2019re really close. She recently gave birth to her daughter and her and her husband recently told us the name. They decided to name their daughter Ghiuliyette (pronounced Juliet) and her middle name is Mahriya. I thought the spelling was a joke, until she told me they are serious. I told her, that with that spelling of a simple but beautiful name is just going to ruin that little girls life. She got mad and told me to stop \u201eruining\u201c her mood and that I\u2019m being mean. I\u2019m completely honest. The spelling is just bad. Nothing else can explain it. Why ruin such a beautiful name by including letters that don\u2019t belong there?  I texted her yesterday and told her that the little girl will try to change her name or at least go by her middle name since it\u2019s normal. She told me to stop texting her, that I\u2019m a bad friend and that I\u2019m being the asshole for making fun of the name. I don\u2019t think I am. When I told her that the spelling is just bad, she went crazy. She told me that I\u2019m the worst friend ever and that I would never be able to see her daughter again. After that, her husband sent me an email, telling me to stop being so disrespectful. He thinks the spelling is cute and it just makes her unique. Unique-yes. But that\u2019s just going to make that little girl suffer and she will probably be bullied for that spelling. I haven\u2019t replied and honestly I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the asshole here, but I thought I\u2019d ask Reddit since y\u2019all are the best to judge. So, am i the asshole for telling my friend that the name she gave her daughter is bad and will ruin her life? Update: Alright, I get it. I\u2019m an asshole for going after the Name more than once. Sorry for that lmao. I just send her an apology text for doing it, yet I did write how she should try to look at it from another perspective. I also send a few screenshots of the comments just for her to see what other people think of it.FYI I\u2019m supposed to be the godmother, which is why I was extra worried lmao my bad Update 2: Hello again. I\u2019ve been asked if there are any updates and yes there are!So I\u2019ve been talking with Loreen a lot (over text) and she\u2019s slowly starting to notice her \u201emistake\u201c. I apologized again and we are good again. We talked about the name and she told me that she won\u2019t change it and really loves it, but is slowly understanding why it\u2019s weird for others, especially me. Her husband on the other hand is still pretty mad at me. He thinks that I took it too far and that my apologies aren\u2019t from the heart\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. I\u2019ve been asked if I\u2019m still the godmother and yes I am. There were thoughts of changing it, but now that we get along again, I\u2019m back in the role.  Back to the husband: he actually blocked me everywhere and is telling Loreen to do so too because he thinks that I\u2019m manipulating and that I\u2019m lying just so we can get close again. Doesn\u2019t  make sense. Idk. Well either way, it\u2019s getting better with the relationship, just not with the name. ",

        "selftext": "My ex-husband (40M) and I (35F) have two children together (12,11M). We divorced about 10 years ago now because I feel like he regressed as a husband and a father during my second pregnancy and he was even worse when our younger son was born. He was acting like a high school or college kid or a single 20 something with no kids. He spent more time with friends than with us. His friends were also treating me more like his mom and expecting me to pick him up from their houses when they needed to get on with stuff. He fought for 50% custody of our kids which he wasn't given and for the first two or three years he had every other weekend and a two week period during the summer with them as well as alternating holidays. He started being more involved and eventually he did get 50% custody. It was at that time I found out he got some woman pregnant and he realized with three kids he needed to get his act together. He ended up with full custody of his third child. Then he met his wife. They have two more children together now. There are two kids in her life, but I don't believe they're her biological children anyway, who she is also partially supporting. Those two kids don't live with them but apparently she/they pay for stuff for this child. Ex and I started getting along better but then his marriage was rocky. As his marriage worsened he started treating me like a co-parent to all his kids. He'd bring his other children to custody exchanges and expecting interactions between me and his other children. Then it was requests to babysit for him and his wife, which I never did. Then it was comments about our boys old clothes at my house being sent to his house for his other kids and how *we* needed to make sure they had adequate clothing. I told him there was no we in that and he said of course there is, we're co-parents. I said of our two sure, but not his other kids. It was requests for me to have his children in my home or to take them out to eat with me and our kids. And finally it has turned into back to school craziness. I bought supplies for the boys and he told me I hadn't bought nearly enough *for everyone*. I was like hold up, what's that supposed to mean and he pointed out that what I bought wouldn't be possible to share evenly between all five children. I told him we don't have five children, we have two, the two I bought those for. I told him I am responsible for our children not his three others. I told him he has a wife, they share two of those children, the other is in their home, so it's up to them. He told me that I know they don't have a lot of money and I cut him off and told him that still didn't make his children my problem. He said I can't possibly take care of just two of them, not when we're co-parenting and all five kids live together 50% of the time. He said I should be a part of the community to help raise these kids and keeping my distance like I do is *so dang cold.* AITA?",

        "selftext": "My (18f) cousin's (22f) wedding was this weekend. I'll call her Mary. Growing up, we were pretty close, as me and my siblings (20f and 23m) often went to Mary's house. Lately, we haven't seen each other much, because all of them moved away for college, but it's still nice to see each other at family events. A year and a half ago, she met her now husband. He was invited to Christmas, Easter, and every family event since then. When he was there, I noticed that Mary was a lot more distant than usually and barely talked to me but talked with my siblings all night. I figured it was probably just because of our age difference. A few weeks/months ago, we got an invitation to their wedding in the mail. Or at least my parents did. My name wasn't mentioned on the invitation, which was addressed to The *ourlastname*s, but since I still live with my parents, and my brother and sister both got one, I assumed I was included, and so did my parents. But Mary's face dropped when she saw me. She pretended to smile but I could see something was bothering her. The wedding went on, but during the cocktail Mary came up to me and asked me why I came, since she didn't send me an invitation. I was taken aback a bit, but told her that we assumed I was included, and  asked her why she didn't invite me. She avoided the question, but after insisting a bit she told me that she wanted her husband's family to have a good impression of her family, and didn't want them to know that her cousin was a lesbian, because she wanted to have a normal family. For context, our family is pretty open minded, and all of them accept me, but her husband and his family are a lot more traditional and conservative. What I don't understand is, I don't look gay (whatever that means), and they would've never known unless someone told them. I was so shocked. I told her that she was sick for caring about impressing a bunch of bigots more than her own cousin. She got mad at me and we both got a bit loud, which attracted attention. People came to find out what was happening. When they found out, my parents said that she was being mean and shouldn't have made a big deal about this. A bunch of other people said that it was wrong of me to come when I wasn't invited. Mary started telling me to leave, so I stormed off. Since, I have been receiving texts from her and her parents saying that I was a bitch for coming, making a scene, and ruining her big day. I understand that it's her wedding and she can invite whoever she wants, but her words were so hurtful... And I genuinely thought I was invited. But I know it's wrong that I caused such a scene on her wedding day. Maybe I should've just left and not said anything? AITA?",

My dad refuses to give me lunch money for school, said no way in hell to making them (mom made his and now he pays for lunch every day) and doesn't want to give me permission to eat outside school (which is an option with parents consent) because he'd need pay for that. So I make them. I work part time and so I started paying for the ingredients I use in my lunches. My dad got married 2ish years ago. His wife has three kids who are 5, 7 and 8 now. For about a year there's been this issue where my dad and his wife want me to make all four lunches. They said if I'm making my own I should make my siblings (and I say siblings because they're not my sibling) lunches too to save their mom time and to streamline everything. I was like no and my dad's wife was shocked. She called me out for making stuff only for myself. She said it's crazy that I would look at my siblings and not want to make a few things for them too. It escalated to where they said I shouldn't get to eat their dinners if I won't participate in taking care of the family. So I buy my own dinner stuff now and make my own. Now they're calling me out for doing that. They said I could make dinner for all four of us and then we could eat dinner earlier and my dad and his wife could do something else. My dad's wife didn't make lunches for her kids on several occasions to try and make me relent. Their teachers ended up feeding them and writing to her about it. She was super pissed and asked me if I was ashamed. I told her they're her kids and her problem, not mine. I also suggested she take it up with my dad if she's unhappy and wants help feeding her kids because it's not my job. She said if dad won't feed me, he won't feed her kids. I shrugged her off. Monday was a big day in all of this. I was home for hours alone and made a nice dinner. I was eating when my dad's wife came home with her kids, who were hungry and she exploded on me and asked if I'd made the kids dinner. I said no. She demanded to make it up to them I make them lunch for Tuesday (yesterday) and I said no. She called me a bunch of names and told me she fucking hates me because I'm supposed to be a decent kid and yet I won't help feed her kids and it's not how you treat family. I told her because it's not my job and we're not a family. I pointed out she married a guy who isn't a good dad to his own kid, and how her only interactions with said kid were attempting to dump responsibility onto him (me) so she really has no reason to think I owe her anything. Which of course let her to calling me all kinds of things, including an ass. AITA?",

        "selftext": "My wife and I agreed before we got married on a lot of the big things. Where we would live. How we would deal with our families. How we would raise our kids. Stuff like that. Deal breakers.  One of our decisions was that as long as our kids were full time students then they would not have to contribute monetarily to the household budget. Obviously they would still have chores and such. If they weren't full time students then they would get a six month grace period after which they had to pay rent and buy their own food. Rent would be equal to 1/4 of full time minimum wage work.  We agreed on this in 1998.  Our eldest did not want to go to university and used the six months after graduation to work, save money, and plan a trip around the world. When he got back he started an apprenticeship and is now a welder. Our middle kid went to university and is now a nurse. Our youngest did one semester of college and decided it wasn't for him. He also decided that he didn't want to work. After six months I told him that he was now responsible for his rent and food budget. He went crying to his mom saying that he couldn't afford that. She said he didn't have to pay. She didn't discuss it with me first. It was a unilateral decision on her part.  She pays all our bills. I give her a set amount every month to pay for everything. The money she earns she either spends however she wants or it goes into our vacation fund.  So I decided to cut my contribution to our budget by the cost of rent and 1/3 of our grocery bill.  She asked me why I did that and I said that we had an agree that she chose to ignore so I did the same.  She has been paying the difference out of the money that would normally go into our vacation account and she cut back on her personal spending. But she is pissed that I am doing this. She says I'm an asshole for being financially manipulative.  I think she needs to either accept it or get her poor baby to grow up.  She tried getting our older kids on her side but they agree with me.  AITA? ",

I immediately went into research mode. I read labels learned all names for wheat bought hundreds of dollars of food/snacks for him to try. I took him to whole foods and organic markets for hundreds more. I bought wheat alternative flours and began cooking gluten free. He still had digestive issues. So back to dr. Only issue wheat. Come to find out he's spending his pay check at school on biscuits and gluten filled snacks. He goes to a friend's house and bam eats McDonald's and wheat filled junk. The doc and I warned him that this is only mild-moderate but it can get worse. He actually came home with urticaria and hives last weekend. He ate cake and pizza at a friend's.  He's not 10 he's 17. I can't be  with him everywhere and police every single thing he eats.He knows what wheat is and what to look for we literally learned together. The school said they won't cut him off even with a dr note cause he's old enough to police himself. Tgey provide alternatives but he won't eat them. He's stubborn. Tonight we went out to a gluten friendly restaurant and I got him a gluten free meal 26 dollars (ours average 15-18). I made sure he was good with the selction. He didn't eat it but instead snuck off others plates and snuck bread. My MIL is an enabler(just a bit won't bother him 10 bites later) He stunk up the car on the way home and tried to deny that he ate whest but the guy won't lie. He is wanting to stay home due to gut pain but I'm getting peeved cause he's causing it. Am I an awful mom that If he's going to eat what he wants that I am just over making the effort and spending way extra money when he's not even following the diet (I have been begging, trying ,and cooking GF for over 9 mos and have spent thousands trying to find what even I feel taste pretty good alternative). I don't want to be a uncaring person but I feel like I'm wasting time and money that we don't really have when it makes no difference. AITA?",

        "selftext": "I (22f) and my husband (23m) got married young, I was eighteen, he was nineteen. Both of us knew we always wanted to get married and start a family young. I started college two years ago, and he just graduated with a Bachelor of Biomedical Science. My husband has a girl best friend (23f), who i'll call Sam, who he met in College, both of them grew up Baptist, and while he's left the church, they had a very similar childhood and bonded quite quickly. Despite what you may be thinking her and I got along really well. She and I liked the same music and we were both studying in relatively the same fields so she became a friend of mine as well. Since I found out I was pregnant though, some issues have started to arise. We announced our pregnancy on social media after we told our parents. Sam texted my husband a congrats text and then told him to pass on her well wishes to me. She's been texting him nonstop with baby advice and what she likes to call advice for mama which includes sometimes relatively targeted jabs at what I should eat. Honestly i kept brushing the texts off, but it got a point where the conversations were less about the baby and more about me which I was getting increasingly uncomfortable with because she wasn't texting me she was texting my husband. My husband acknowledged this and has just started to show them to me and ask what I want him to do. I just told him to ignore them. When i announced I was having a baby shower and sent out the invites, I recieved a text from Sam. She said something along the lines of wanting to host my baby shower and set it up. I told her politely that my mom was planning on hosting it with the help of my sister and that it was a special moment for them and I wouldn't want to take that away. Well Sam ignored that message, because the next day, she came over and insisted we start working out arrangements for the venue. I told her once again, my mom and sister were hosting it and she told me that she should take her advice and let her plan it because she'd ensure that the baby shower would be better if she planned it particularly because she'd be working on the menu. Whether it was pregnancy hormones or just bottled up rage, i told her that the jabs she'd been making at me behind my back about my diet during this pregnancy to my husband are really annoying at that no she cannot host this shower and from now on her unsolicited advice was not appreciated especially if she can't say it to my face. That night my husband's phone blew up with messages from Sam saying that he had no right to show her those messages and they were just supposed to just be health tips because Sam was studying nutritional science and only wanted to help her best friend and ensure a happy baby and life. I know she had somewhat good intentions and she's been a good friend to my husband and to me so AITA? ***UPDATES IN COMMENTS***",

I also work out of town. I started doing that once the kids were old enough to take care of themselves with their dad at home. So when my youngest was in middle school and the oldest was a junior in high school.  It is great. Our retirement savings are piling up and we have been able to splurge on the kids. And ourselves.  My husband is upset however because I decided to pay for a cleaning lady. He and I discussed it and we agreed that him and the kids didn't do a great job keeping the house clean and tidy while I was away. I hated coming home to a mess. It caused a few fights because it was like they expected me to come home and clean up after them.  Having her is fantastic. I come home to a clean house and I am happier. My kids have more time to study and do extracurriculars. They still have chores and they are still expected to clean up after themselves.  My husband came to me last time I was home and said we should cut back on the service when I'm home. That I should be doing more housework. He thinks that we are wasting money. I said that I work 14 days in a row and that those are 13 hour days. Yes it is mostly paperwork but his job as a teacher isn't much more physically challenging. I said that I could offer him two options. If he wanted we could completely get rid of the service and him and the kids could make sure the house was in good shape when I got home. Or he could pay me my hourly rate to do extra housework when I am on my days off.  He is upset with me and sys that I'm being financially manipulative. I think if he and the kids actually did what they are supposed to do when I'm away bone of this would be an issue.",

        "selftext": "So this is a bit of a weird one. I (41M) was at a friend's birthday party on the weekend just past. There were 9 of us at the party including the birthday boy (which is surprisingly relevant). All fake names from here on out. Amy (30ish F), one of the guests, baked a cake for the birthday boy. After the relevant party traditions of singing the birthday song, and the hip-hip-hooraying that happens after the birthday song here in Australia, I went back to talking to one of my friends when Amy came up to me and the other friend with 2 plates of cake and offered them to my friend and I. We both said yes, thanked her, and then she made a really odd face and walked away. My friend and I both said it was weird, and went back to chatting. I ate some of the cake and it had desiccated coconut inside it, which I don't particularly like, so after a couple of bites, I ignored it and then chucked it out when the party ended about an hour or so later. About 45 minutes ago, Steven (30ish M), Amy's partner, sent me a series of angry texts (8am on a Monday morning is really not the best time to receive angry texts) saying how Amy spent last night crying about how she didn't get to eat any of her cake and that I took a slice of it only to throw it away and deprive her of her own cake, and that she only cut 8 slices since she knows I don't like coconut, but I took her slice and threw it away to spite her. I replied, Why did she even offer me any cake if she knew there was coconut inside? Steven said that she did it to be polite and not leave me out, and that I was an asshole for taking her slice and throwing it away. I forwarded the message to my other friends that were there, and most of them have left me on read so far, except one who responded with a thumbs down emoji, and another who hasn't seen it yet (as of this writing). The fact that no one's responding to me is making me worry that I might have been the asshole here.",

I learned this when I caught her with the man in question and after quizzing her, she admitted there was a strong chance he was the father of the baby she was pregnant with. I ended our marriage right there and took a DNA test when her youngest was born and she was not mine. So in the divorce custody and support was only factored in for our two kids. I paid some child support because I made more than her but we had 50-50 custody time with the kids and I remained an involved dad. My ex lived with her youngest's father October of last year when he took off without a word and dipped from their lives. She has been in pursuit of child support ever since but he cannot be found and he quit the last known job he had, so she has been unsuccessful so far. This has led to her struggling and I buy more for the kids we share so they don't suffer because of the failed relationship with the affair partner. Last month my ex told me she was struggling to keep up with the expenses for her youngest and she asked me if I would maybe buy some stuff that included her too. I said no, that I was responsible for my kids and I would not become financially responsible in any way for the child she made while cheating on me. She begged and told me they will have different lives if I don't help at least for now and I told her that was not my problem and maybe she'll think about that in the future before she starts an ongoing affair. She told our kids about asking me and encouraged them to ask me for them. The kids were confused because they have always known their half sister is not my child but they started to doubt because of how their mom talked (saying good men take care of all their children and loving a child who is part of your family should never be that hard). The kids approached me and asked me about it and told me their mom wanted them to ask me for stuff for their half sister. So I explained to them that she is not my child or part of my family but she is still part of theirs. They asked why since my oldest has some memories of his mom and I being together while she was pregnant. I said their mom got pregnant with their half sister while we were together but DNA proved she was not mine and I did not raise her for that reason. I told them I am still their dad and nothing has changed but I was never really their half sister's dad and don't want to buy her stuff like I do for them. They understood and when they went back to their mom's she called and cussed me out for telling the kids more details than she wanted them to know. I said they had always been aware they had a different dad to her other child and that needed to remain clear because I was not claiming her now that her father has abandoned her.

The entire time they\u2019ve been married, she\u2019s been a housewife and now she\u2019s a stay at home mom with no plans to return to work. I think that\u2019s fine and have been supportive. I also know she and her husband both have sizeable life insurance policies so if god forbid, one dies, they\u2019ll be okay. However, she also signed a prenup. Which again, I think is smart. But according to my daughter, she\u2019d get a very small settlement. And even with child support, there\u2019s a good chance she\u2019d have to return to work. And after being out of the workforce for a bit, who knows if that\u2019ll be a challenge. My main worry is my niece fell into this scenario and even with child support, she struggled. So, my husband (her father) and I set up a \u201cjust in case\u201d account. If she and her husband divorce, she\u2019ll have money to fall back on just in case. If they remain married past the time my husband and I die, it\u2019ll just be added to what she\u2019ll inherit.  I didn\u2019t intend on telling her about it unless it happened but my husband pointed out that if she was ever in a situation where she wanted to leave but worried she financially couldn\u2019t, it\u2019d be good for her to know she has a Plan B. So, we told her and she was a little surprised. She said she appreciated it but felt we were \u201crooting against her\u201d. I said we love her husband and hope they have a long, healthy marriage. We have always been supportive. But this is similar to the prenup. A just in case. A last resort.  Well, she told her husband and he\u2019s pissed at us as well, saying that we don\u2019t trust him. I said it\u2019s looking out for our daughter and really is no different from the prenup. I added that just as he\u2019ll always want to protect his daughter, we\u2019ll always want to protect ours.

No apology, just, \u201cWe\u2019ll do it another time.\u201d I was frustrated because I had completely cleared my weekend, turned down plans with friends, and rearranged my work schedule for this. I responded by telling her it wasn\u2019t cool to cancel on me last minute like that, especially when I went out of my way to help. Then, two days later, she called me again asking if I could watch the kids the following weekend. Apparently, something came up with her original plan, and she needed someone to watch them after all. I told her no, I wasn\u2019t available. She got upset and said I was being selfish and punishing her kids for something that wasn\u2019t their fault. Now she\u2019s mad at me, and my parents are saying I should be more understanding because \u201cthings come up when you\u2019re a parent.\u201d I don\u2019t have kids, but I feel like it\u2019s just basic respect to not cancel on someone last minute and then expect them to be available whenever you want. So, AITA for refusing to watch my sister's kids after she canceled on me last minute? Edit: Wow, I didn\u2019t expect so many NTA responses! Thanks, everyone. I was starting to feel guilty about standing my ground, but it\u2019s good to hear that others agree it\u2019s important to set boundaries, even with family. I love my nieces and nephew, but my time is valuable too, and I\u2019m glad I\u2019m not being unreasonable here. Thanks again for all the support!",

        "selftext": "I (26F) was invited to a wedding within my state but far enough that to attend I'd have to sleep over at a hotel for at least two nights if I arrived the night before as it was planned to be a pretty much all-day affair.   I was very flattered to be invited as I didn't think I was that close to the couple. It was a fairly small wedding (~60 guests including the bridal party). Obviously as it was very small and I was possibly a second round invitee I didn't get a plus one. Fine with me. I ultimately decided to go. When I went to book the hotel room for my stay I found they only had large rooms available (multiple beds or king beds etc) as it's a popular wedding destination and is a bit fancy. So, I thought, why not invite my boyfriend (26M)? That way we could trade off on the long drive there and back and share the big room I would have to pay for anyways. The idea was that night we arrived we could get dinner together somewhere new and have a nice breakfast before heading back home. While I was at the wedding events he could just hang out in the hotel room or the pool or whatever. The wedding went great, but then after it wrapped up, the maid of honor (who I'm closer to than the bride) was chatting with me as I walked back to my room and I knocked on the door instead of digging through my bag for the keycard. When my boyfriend opened the door for me the MoH just greeted him and walked off. I didn't think it was a big deal or anything. A few days later the MoH reached out and said it was awkward and uncomfortable for me to have invited him to the hotel and it made 'everyone' feel bad and weird that he was there waiting for the wedding to end when they hadn't invited him.  We were both a bit surprised! No one even knew he was there because it didn\u2019t come up at all during the wedding. It definitely wasn\u2019t a secret, and honestly, we wouldn\u2019t have thought it was a big deal if people did know. AND he had only met the bride and groom like six times and had zero issues with not being invited to such an intimate wedding. Also if it matters I was far from the only guest who didn't get a plus one and I never asked to be given a plus one for him.  I have no clue if the MoH told the bride and if the bride also thinks this was inappropriate. If she hasn't I really don't want to contact her during her honeymoon to start drama. I didn't check or anything beforehand (that's my bad, I guess) so was inviting him really a big deal?",

The big issue right now is that they eloped, which they are allowed to do obviously. He told everyone last night at diner. It was a big shock to everyone since for the longest time they didn't want to marry. When he told the news, our mother told him congratulations but it was clear that she wasn't very happy about it. She didn't say anything but her congratulations where forced and she looked close to crying. I asked if she was fine when cleaning up. Mom was sad that she didn't get to see him get married but overall she would be fine. My brother gave me a call later that night and he had an issue with her response. He wasn't happy at all that she wasn't very excited. That him and his wife found it disrespectful. I asked if mom said anything  to him and heconfirmed she didn't. I told him that mom isn't a fucking robot and she is allowed to be sad. That she didn't get to see her kid get married and being sad isn't an odd emotion to have about it.  This started an arguement and he thinks I am being a jerk for defending her. ",

We've had her around our house a lot the last few months and we've noticed that her parent's don't really know how to look after her hair. I'm white and my husband is mixed. His black grandmother lives with us and she has pointed out the girl's hair and even tried to give her some haircare advice.  I decided to bring up with the mom about her daughter's hair and that my husband's grandma was happy to give some advice or even wash/detangle and braid her hair. The mom was really upset that I would suggest she couldn't take care of her daughter properly and that I was overstepping boundaries. I told her that my grandma-in-law just wanted to help her to help her daughter. She told me I was being rude and undermining her parenting. She also told me I wasn't the first person to bring this up. I'm worried now because I really didn't think she would react like that. I'm worried I've ruined my daughter's new friendship. I understand why she's upset at thinking I'm trying to suggests she's not looking after her daughter properly. On the other hand, it's 2024. There is so much information out there to help her with her daughter's hair plus we live near a big city where there is loads of salons she could take her daughter to.  AITA for bringing this up?

        "selftext": "Throwaway account because my main has personal info.   My (34F) mother (59F) has not worked for the last ~30 years. When we were little, dad worked and she was a SAHM. She refused to work even when we were older, I remember my parents fighting about it. After their divorce mom remarried almost instantly and relied on her (much older) husband, who died last year leaving everything for his adult kids and almost nothing for her.   After the death of her second husband, mom moved in with my brother and his wife. She was supposed to look after their kids while they work. This didn't work out and they are kicking her out, which is totally my mom's fault, I told her multiple times this would happen if she continued to act like she did. She was extremely mean to SIL, tried to run their household, acted like the queen, refused to watch the kids full time,which was their original agreement (she only watched them like half day twice a week and when she did she neglected them like not changing a poopy diaper for god knows how long because she was hoping SIL would be back soon and do it, which resulted in baby getting a very nasty rash, etc etc).   Now she wants to move in with me. She's claiming she'd help with the kid (I have a 2yo). I told her no, I saw what happened to my brother and SIL, you caused major issues in their marriage and I will not risk it. After all, you always told us adult children should never live with their parents (yes, we were both kicked out at 18 right after we finished school). She started crying and saying she doesn't have anywhere to go (she has until the end of the month to leave my brother's house). I told her neither did I when she kicked me out at 18 and I went to live on my friends couch but I worked and eventually rented a room so I guess that's what she should do - that's what everyone else does. She asked me to at least pay her rent until she gets back on her feet, I said no, you're a healthy working age person, you should not be freeloading (that's exactly what she told me when I was 18). We had a very big fight but I refused to let her move in or give her money. I'm sure she should still have some from her inheritance and I know for a fact my brother gave her money so I didn't feel guilty at all.   Now, multiple relatives are texting me, basically saying me and SIL are horrible people. Mom's dead husbands son called to scold me, telling me my mom is my responsibility and not theirs so I should do what's right. I do not feel guilty but perhaps that's what makes me the AH? Am I? I do feel bad about people claiming I'm a bad daughter. Mainly because my mother was never a model mom herself, she never put her kids first and was generally disinterested in us unless she needed something. I mean, if she were nice, I'd be happy to have her near ",

At first I was upset about Mara and my dad dating and didn't want to meet her and gave her a hard time. I told her I didn't want her replacing my mom. She gave me space to let out all my feelings at her and then she reassured me she was not here to take mom's place. She told me she really liked my dad and wanted to really like me too but she didn't have to be my mom for us to like each other. At first I wasn't sure if I believed her. But she won me over and we got along really well. She even lived with us for a year. But when I was 10 dad broke up with Mara and said she wasn't trying hard enough to fill the role of mom for me and I needed a mom. I told him I didn't want another mom and I loved Mara. That she was the best. Mara was blindsided by it because things had been so good and I don't think my dad had said it would be a dealbreaker. Within a few months he met his wife, Stacey. Stacey was a single mom with a 2 year old daughter. I was 11 by then. Stacey was very on board to be my new mom and I was not. I said it so many times I didn't want a new mom, I wouldn't call someone else mom, I missed Mara and wouldn't give Stacey a chance if she tried to take over mom's place. I was ignored and dad and Stacey got married when I was 12. After my 16th birthday, which was June, my dad kinda realized I was serious about not wanting a mom and not giving Stacey a chance to be my mom. She has tried so hard too. She has tried to make me love her and her daughter. But I'm not here to get a new mom. I'm not open to it, something dad now knows. It's caused a lot of strain with him and Stacey because Stacey found out I had DMd Mara recently and apologized for dad and thanked her for being awesome and saying I miss her. Stacey said she can't even get me to say I like her. I told her it's because I don't. That I don't like people who don't listen or who think they can make me do things like let them be my new mom. Stacey said she was expecting/promised a family for her daughter. Not this. Dad pulled me aside a few nights ago and told me he now realizes I was serious about the things I said and he realizes I loved Mara. But that he really wanted the best for me and someone who wouldn't even try to be my mom wasn't it. He told me Stacey would be such a good second mom to me and I could have a sister, if I give this a chance. He said his marriage could end if we can't pull together as a family. I told him he made a dumb decision and I wouldn't fix it for him. I said it was fine if Mara just wasn't the one for him or if their relationship changed. But I loved her because she wasn't my mom. She was someone I could trust and love as Mara. And that my dislike of Stacey wasn't changing and neither was my unwillingness to get a new mom. Dad told me I don't get to speak to him like that. That I was out of line. AITA?",

This already makes me feel very awkward but now she has asked if I can stop wearing makeup and wear baggy clothes around him. We went out for dinner last night at a reasonably expensive restaurant with a few others (7 of us in total) and she text me when I got home saying she was angry at me for \u2018looking hot\u2019 after she asked me to not wear makeup. She\u2019s my friend and I want to do the right thing but there\u2019s nothing I could wear that is baggy that would have suited the restaurant we were in (Michelin star). My style is very conservative and I was wearing a very average dress with heels. I\u2019ve written out several responses ranging from an apology to being quite rude but wanted to sense check my thoughts here before I go back to her. I don\u2019t want to make life difficult for her but what she\u2019s asking for feels unreasonable. AITA?  Edit 1: thank you so much for all of your responses. It\u2019s 4.21am here in the UK so I will write out and send a response tomorrow and will update you all on here. Sorry I can\u2019t respond to everyone; I didn\u2019t expect so many responses.  Edit 2: While I was reading your responses, he just liked an old Instagram pic from way back (bikini pic!). He is now blocked.  FINAL UPDATE - Edit 3: I responded with the following: \u201cSorry it\u2019s taken me a while to reply but I wanted to consider this properly and not react emotively. I\u2019m sorry you feel that way but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair or reasonable to ask me to change how I look because of your husband. My advice is to speak to (husband\u2019s name) and work on your relationship because projecting your issues onto me isn\u2019t going to help you, but it will damage our friendship. You have nothing to be insecure about; you\u2019re the most beautiful person inside and out I\u2019ve ever met. I\u2019m here for you if you want to talk through it but ultimately I can\u2019t help it if I\u2019m smoking hot (just kidding).

She told me they were having problems and it was wrong of her to take it out on me. we\u2019ve had a long chat and I\u2019m going to be there to support my friend. Thank you all for your input; you all helped so much!! ADDITIONAL INFO: I\u2019ve had a lot of people message me asking if they can post my story elsewhere and a couple of reporters etc. I really don\u2019t want to exploit my friend\u2019s marriage so I don\u2019t mind if you use it but please keep me anonymous.

        "selftext": "let's get straight to the point, I (22F) am a full-time baker for a small business and college student. I moved back up to my home state in September of 2023, mostly to get away from my toxic family and for better opportunities. Also to add why this is even an issue in the first place, My brother Jay(25M) and I are the black sheep of the family, mostly due to the fact we were born and mostly raised outside of marriage. The teasing and neglect only grew worse after our mother(44F) married Jerkfish(54M) and had our half siblings; (20F), (17M), (16M), and (11M). Now, here's the dilemma. My half-sister who we will call Jojo(20F) is getting married to Rhitt(22M) in July. My mom and grandma asked that I make them a wedding cake, which I would've happily agreed to if I was invited to the wedding. The thing is, they wanted me to make a cake fit for 200 people, get a hotel near them (They hate that I'm not a Christian, so they think I'll bring evil into their house), work for 3 days, and get a flight there and back. I'd have to pay for all of it, they think it'd be a nice gift to my sister. I just laughed and sent them my price sheet, they. flipped. out. I was bombarded with texts from them about how selfish I am, how I am truly vile, how I am toxic for expecting my family to pay for my cake when they could just go to Walmart to get one, etc.. Jojo even messaged me on discord a week after I had sent the price sheet and asked why I would charge her when I made my best friend a free wedding cake. I simply told her to f off as not only was I invited to her wedding, but I was the MOH and in a way it was a returning the favor for being a genuinely good friend and helping me out when I was going through a lot. Jay and his wife had said I'm not wrong for it and they'd do the same thing, and my boyfriend is on my side. However, a few people in my life are saying I should've just said a simple no instead of sending the sheet and that my response to my sister was harsh. So, I need an outside perspective, hopefully other bakers on here too. AITA?   Update #1: I found out the exact reason for my brother's family and I not getting invited. Three months after my sister and her soon-to-be husband got engaged, my grandmother requested my sister not invite the sinners. It was more along the lines of: If you don't invite your siblings you'll get a hefty portion of my will.. Don't really know what the proper term for that is, but I digress.  So, my sister is catering to the needs of my racist grandmother over her own sisters. I also found out another reason(out of the many) why my brother and I where black sheep in the family. So, you see. my mother is whiter than paper. My brother and i's biological father is Lakota/Sioux native American.  We were told he just left us because that's how the savages act. when in reality, our dad died from a terminal raspatory illness that he had since he was a toddler. Some cyst type of deal? Not too sure. The hatred from them only grew further when my brother married a black woman and had my 3 nieces together. (Fourth on the way). I told jojo how hurt I was by picking money over family but I kinda expected it. She tried to offer me $50 to make the cake she wanted and I just declined. i shared this post with my brother and he is rolling while reading the comments. Also, to the people who dm'ed me to tell me that they hope i go out of business (My boss says hi btw) and that I deserved getting abused as child because I'm a snot now... F off. :) Stay awesome and brutal as ever reddit. Thank you for all of the support.",

        "selftext": "A few months ago me (28f) and my sister \u201cEva\u201d (33f) realized that we were both pregnant (I\u2019d say she was about 6 weeks further than I was). She\u2019s been struggling with infertility, so we were all happy for her. I have an older son (2m) with my husband (32m).  Sadly, a couple weeks ago I lost my baby. We told my family. They were all supportive, but I did sort of pull away from them. They would\u2019ve tried to avoid discussing Eva\u2019s baby around me, but I didn\u2019t want to overshadow her, especially since she\u2019s wanted this for a long time. I also didn\u2019t want to be reminded of my own loss whenever I saw her. So I haven\u2019t been to my parents\u2019 place for Sunday dinner since or really spent time with Eva, which we had been doing a lot before. I replied vaguely to any messages about my absence, wasn\u2019t the best communication from me. Yesterday my parents were hosting family dinner for my dad\u2019s birthday. I\u2019d been thinking about going because I missed my family, and while of course the pain of losing my child has not faded, I\u2019m at a point where I can at least put it a little to the side to be there for my sister and my new niece (when she is born).  So I let my family know that we would be coming. However, we had to get a gift for my dad and then my son had a bit of a tantrum, so we got to my parents\u2019 place about an hour late. I wished my dad and then went to the kitchen, where my mom, Eva, and my SILs were. But before I went in, I heard them say my name so I stopped. My mom was saying something like \u201cWell I guess [OP]\u2019s not coming\u201d and Eva said \u201cWhat did you expect, she probably changed her mind and is just staying home again. Honestly, I\u2019m sorry for her but you would think she was the first woman to ever lose a kid. And it\u2019s not even her first kid.\u201d They then kept talking about other things, but I just wanted to leave.  I went and got my husband, who was with my BIL, dad, and brothers in the living room. I told my dad I was really sorry but we needed to go. They all protested, but my husband could see how upset I was so he didn\u2019t. We got my son and left.  When we got home, I just kind of cried for a while. My husband asked me what happened and I told him. He was angry that she said that, but thought we shouldn\u2019t have abruptly left because my dad had been looking forward to seeing us, and my son missed his cousins. After this, I was feeling conflicted. Later my brother texted me saying my dad had been really upset about us leaving and brought it up at dinner, which caused a whole fight because mom and Eva realized that I must\u2019ve heard them talking, and my dad was mad about it. My brother said that it was pretty bad and he wished I had just stayed so none of it would\u2019ve happened, obviously Eva didn\u2019t mean for me to hear that, they were all just frustrated that I\u2019d been AWOL for so long.  Now I feel bad, because I didn\u2019t mean to ruin dinner. Obviously what Eva said was hurtful, but I can see how my actions might have led to her saying something out of anger, and I could\u2019ve talked to her about it later instead of just leaving. Idk, AITA? ETA for additional context: - My family is the type to just drop by at each other\u2019s places and see one other multiple times throughout the week besides just Sunday dinner. Lately I\u2019ve been kind of fielding off any requests for people to visit. I just want to I guess emphasize how close my family is and how abnormal it is for me to not be seeing them regularly even for a little bit. I haven\u2019t been ghosting them, but I just text them saying \u201cI\u2019m not feeling up to it\u201d for dinner and kind of leave it there. - My sister and my mom have always been closer to each other, as have me and my dad. Additionally, my brothers are closer to her since they\u2019re all closer in age. - I mentioned this in a comment, but we didn\u2019t text anyone saying we were going to be late since my family is usually pretty lax about time (me and my husband usually show up early though so it\u2019s unusual for us to be late and might\u2019ve been why they thought we weren\u2019t coming). Also my son was continuing to be a handful all the way there so that kept us busy and we kind of didn\u2019t think about notifying anyone. - I\u2019ve started looking into grief counseling, now that I feel like I can at least talk about it. - As far as she\u2019s told us, my sister hasn\u2019t had a miscarriage before, she just had trouble getting pregnant to begin with. - From what my brother told me, my sister and mom didn\u2019t admit to saying anything, they just kind of looked at each other once my dad mentioned me leaving, and he noticed and asked about it. Then one of my SILs who was also in the kitchen (my other brother\u2019s wife) mentioned what they said and my dad got mad. My other brother was also apparently angry with them and it just turned into my mom and sister trying to defend themselves, my dad and other brother yelling, and my brother (who texted me) trying to stay out of it.

        "selftext": "I (56F) divorced my husband two years ago after 26 years of marriage. We have four kids, and the split was amicable. He came out as gay, and we mutually agreed to part ways. Changing my name wasn\u2019t a priority\u2014updating IDs, legal documents, and bank accounts would be a huge hassle. I still use his last name on official documents but go by my maiden name socially. Recently, he got engaged to a wonderful guy. I\u2019ve been supportive of their relationship, but during my grandson\u2019s birthday party, my ex suddenly asked if I\u2019d consider dropping his last name. His fianc\u00e9 chimed in, saying it makes him uncomfortable that I still use it. I was caught off guard and awkwardly joked that unless they want to spend hours in lines at various government offices, I wasn\u2019t going to change it. My ex didn\u2019t laugh. He insisted it\u2019s about starting a new chapter and wants me to \u201cmove on.\u201d The whole situation felt bizarre. For two years, it\u2019s never been an issue, and now they\u2019re ganging up on me? After the party, my ex called and argued that keeping his name makes it hard for his fianc\u00e9 to feel like they\u2019re starting a fresh life. I countered that our kids still use the same name, and it would feel strange for me to be the odd one out. What really hurt was learning from my youngest son that his fianc\u00e9 feels threatened by my name, assuming I\u2019m clinging to some claim on my ex. I\u2019ve made it clear I have zero interest in rekindling anything, but it feels like I\u2019m being pressured to erase a part of my identity. My ex admitted his fianc\u00e9 is uncomfortable because he sees me keeping the name as a \u201cpower play.\u201d I feel like I\u2019m caught between trying to keep peace and being forced into something just because his fianc\u00e9 is insecure. They want me to go through the hassle of changing everything for their comfort. I told my ex that I\u2019ll consider it later\u2014maybe after they\u2019re married and settled. But now, he\u2019s furious, saying I\u2019m being petty and selfish. My friends think I should stand my ground, but my kids are divided\u2014one thinks I should just give in to keep the peace, while the other agrees that it\u2019s ridiculous to change it just because his fianc\u00e9 feels insecure. I\u2019m frustrated. I don\u2019t see why a name on some legal documents is such a big deal, but they\u2019re making me feel like the villain. So, AITA for refusing to drop my ex-husband\u2019s last name even though he\u2019s getting remarried?",

        "selftext": "Back when Eras tour tickets were released, my friend Sadie said she would grab us tickets and I\u2019d pay her back. We made concrete plans and I was excited. I\u2019ve been a Swiftie for years but haven't seen her live. I had to sell my Rep stadium tour tickets back in the 2010s because my mom was dying and I needed the money to help pay medical bills. I booked the hotel. This past weekend I was having a little get together for a bunch of friends and Sadie was of course invited. At some point she pulled me aside and told me that she had news, she is leaving in September. I was heartbroken! We\u2019ve been friends for years and I love spending time with her. I got weepy and hugged her a bunch and said that we needed to get all our thrifting trips in over the summer and hang out as much as we could. Then she broke the news that as a way to bond with her sister before she left, she was going to be taking her to the Eras tour instead. I didn\u2019t know how to react. She stood in front of me and Venmo\u2019d my payment back. She was like \u201cI know you understand.\u201d I said that this was a sneaky move and honestly really shitty of her, and I don\u2019t understand how or why she would do that to me. She got defensive and said that they were under her name and that she didn\u2019t \u201cowe me\u201d anything. I was like yes, they are your tickets. Legally, you can do whatever you want. But this is still a really shitty and sneaky thing to do to your friend, knowing that there is no way I will be able to get my own tickets at this point. She just kind of shrugged and said \u201cSorry, but I figured you\u2019d understand.\u201d I asked her to leave, and told her to please not come back for the 4th of July party next week. I said I needed to process this and that I\u2019m really disappointed with her and how she\u2019s treated me. This is a girl who I consoled through breakups, job losses, pet losses, etc. She looked shocked and asked if I was serious. She ended up stomping off and leaving and texted me later to tell me that she\u2019s \u201caround\u201d if I want to apologize for making HER feel bad about taking her sister on a \u201cbonding\u201d trip. I\u2019m honestly heartbroken that I\u2019m going to be watching \u201cmy\u201d show on a grainy livestream instead of being there in the stadium with everyone. I was looking forward to this so much. I checked the resale sites and had a sad little cry about it. I am wondering if I am completely wrong to have just uninvited her. Is that too far? If it was in, say, a month or two, I don\u2019t think I would have. I just need time? **Hi everyone and thank you for the responses so far. I just wanted to follow this up by saying that I appreciate the sentiment, but I'm not going to sue her over this. I don't really think that is a normal reaction or something that I would enjoy doing. Please don't hate me.**",

My oldest wasn\u2019t planning to have Emma in the wedding party. It was Emma who really wanted to be a bridesmaid because she was excited and wanted to be involved.

This way, no one is constantly hosting, and it makes it fair for everyone. This post is about my middle daughter, Clara. Clara has always been skipping her host duties, when it gets to her she has an excuse why she can't host. It ranges but usually goes along the lines of stress or she is too busy.  This results in other family members to pick up her holiday. It is frustrating and multiple people have talked to her about this. She bailed on hosting Easter but promised me that she would do Thanksgiving we swapped holidays. At the time I made it very clear she needed to stay true to her word and if she dumped it on someone else she wouldn't be going to Thanksgiving. It usually gets dumped on me. Anyway, I called her asking if she wanted me to bring a dessert board for Thanksgiving. She told me that she could not host because she had just moved into her home (she moved in July), and it was too messy to host. I told her she could clean since it was a few weeks away. She told me she can't.  I know the other kids can't host it, (well one could but she is doing Christmas and its not fair at all for her). I informed everyone it would beat my place this year. I also informed everyone that Clara is not invited this year to Thanksgiving. Clara was pissed when I told her that and we got into a huge argument. She thinks I am a big jerk. My other kids are split, two of them are happy since they are tired of picking up her slack when this happens while others things this is too far.    So outside opinion",

        "selftext": "Final Update: They have decided that a child free wedding isn't feasible. They will also be setting up a children's play area.  My cousin is getting married at the end of August in California at a vineyard. No one in the family is in California so to go I need to get a hotel. Me, my mom, and brother found an AirBNB that relatively close. Also I should mention my husband is posted abroad and won't be coming, I was going to fly to the US for this.  The invite came out only three weeks ago and we had to scramble to find a place.  The issue now is that I have a 4 month old baby who only breastfeeds and won't take a bottle. She had to drink from an open cup one time because I needed to take a driving exam and that is the longest she has ever been away from me.  They just let us know that no children under 12 are allowed. So I told them that logistically I can't come. They suggested that me and my mother go back and forth to the AirBNB to watch the baby and I said it's just too big of a deal. To fly all the way there, pay for an AirBNB and then go back and forth during the wedding. It just doesn't seem worth it, its a lot of effort to do all of that by myself with a small baby. The airbnb and plane are still refundable at this point.  My cousin is mad that I'm cancelling as they paid per head and can't reduce the amount at this point. I said they can try and find someone else to invite. I said it's his fault that they didn't write the child rule on the invitation. He said I should not be stingy and get a babysitter, I don't know anyone in that area of California and honestly paying for a babysitter on top of an AirBNB and flight is ridiculous to me. He says it standard to not bring children to weddings... So AITA for cancelling close to the date because I can't bring my baby with me.  Edits for clarity: Short notice is because bride is pregnant. I live with my husband in Germany where he is posted. Baby already has passport because she is only US citizen.Because of the shotgun nature the wedding, the invite consisted of a graphic image without particular guest names emailed to the guests. The RSVP system also let me choose up to three people(so I thought that was me, my baby, and my husband).  Update: Apparently about 30 people have cancelled because of this and that's why they are complaining so much about the costs ",

It took me a while to warm up to the group and to connect with people I actually had anything in common with. I had to wade through a lot of botox parties and boozy brunches to find things I was interested in. But I did, and I started coming to group events fairly often. I hang out most often with the women who like to read, do crafty things, bake, skywatch, etc. Among these women is one, I\u2019ll call her Andea, who has made several comments about how she\u2019s a total klepto. I think that she makes these comments to seem \u201ccool\u201d to the other people in the group. I reached out to some of the women I see regularly at these events and invited them over to my place to watch a TV show we\u2019d been talking about and do crafty stuff. They were excited and agreed to come. Unfortunately, Andrea found out (I assume someone asked if she was going) and reached out to me to ask if she was invited. I considered this for a bit and then told her no, as I only had so much room at home. She didn\u2019t believe me and asked me for the real reason, saying \u201cI thought we got along\u201d which yes, is true.\u00a0 I told her I\u2019m not comfortable inviting a kleptomaniac into my home. That I\u2019ve worked hard to have the things I have and it would be stupid for me to invite her knowing that she openly brags about it.\u00a0 She said \u2018Okay\u2019 very quietly. She then said \u201cYou\u2019re painting me out to be some horrible criminal when you don\u2019t even know anything about me.\u201d\u00a0 I said that her being proud to call herself a klepto was all I needed to know. She said that I was a high school mean girl and ableist. I am unsure what the foundation for that statement is. This unfortunately has spilled over to the group, which is frustrating. But what has me the most surprised is that there are so many people defending her and telling me that I\u2019m out of touch and take things too literally. Am I?",

When the trip was being discussed, I reminded Jake that Olivia would only be a few months old, and we would be deep in the newborn phase. He reassured me that if things got too tough, he would cancel the trip to help me out, and I trusted him. Now that Olivia is here, things have been harder than I anticipated. Between the sleepless nights, breastfeeding struggles, and just trying to adjust to motherhood, I\u2019ve been feeling overwhelmed. Jake has been helpful, but I can tell he\u2019s excited about this trip, which is coming up next month. Last week, I asked Jake if he could consider canceling the trip, reminding him of his promise. I told him that I\u2019m struggling and that having him gone for a whole week would be really tough on me. He seemed surprised and a bit hurt that I was asking him to cancel. He said he\u2019s been looking forward to this trip for months, and that he needs a break, too. He also pointed out that his parents live nearby and could help if I needed support while he was away. I understand that Jake needs a break and wants to spend time with his friends, but I can\u2019t help feeling like this is a time when I really need him by my side. I tried to explain that while I appreciate his parents' help, it\u2019s not the same as having him here. Jake said that I\u2019m being unfair by asking him to cancel the trip after all the planning that went into it and that I need to trust him to make sure I\u2019m supported even if he\u2019s not physically there. Now, we\u2019re at a bit of a standoff. Some of my friends think I should let him go, saying that it\u2019s important for him to have some time away, especially after all the stress of becoming a new dad. But others agree that it\u2019s too soon for him to take off for a week, and that he should prioritize being home with me and Olivia. So AITA for asking my husband to cancel his bro\u2019s only trip to help me with our newborn after he promised he would? edit: Hey, everyone. I just wanted to give a quick update after reading through most of the replies. I was honestly overwhelmed by the amount of support and understanding I received\u2014thank you so much to everyone who took the time to respond. Your kind words and thoughtful advice really helped me feel less alone in this situation. A lot of you suggested that I should also take a week off, letting Jake stay with Olivia, to get a break for myself. I really appreciate the sentiment behind that suggestion, but there are a couple of reasons why it\u2019s not realistic for me right now. First of all, I\u2019m breastfeeding, so being away from Olivia for that long would be really difficult logistically. But beyond that, and this is something I know I need to work on, I just don\u2019t feel comfortable being away from my baby yet. I know it\u2019s not healthy to feel like I can\u2019t have her out of my sight, but I can\u2019t help it. I guess it\u2019s just that new mom anxiety that\u2019s really hard to shake. I\u2019ve been debating whether or not to show Jake this thread. I\u2019m worried that reading it might hurt his feelings, but I\u2019m definitely going to have another conversation with him about everything. I\u2019m willing to compromise and let him go on the trip, but I think a whole week is just too much. I\u2019m leaning towards suggesting that he limit the trip to a maximum of three nights, so he can still have some time away with his friends but not be gone for an entire week. I\u2019ll update again after we\u2019ve talked. Thanks again for all the support, everyone. It really means a lot to me. Also, I'm new to Reddit, not sure if I should be posting updates or just editing this post.   UPDATE Hey, everyone. I just wanted to share another update after having a very long and emotional talk with Jake. I won\u2019t get into every detail of our conversation, but I\u2019ll touch on the most important points. After putting Olivia to bed, I went straight to bed myself, feeling utterly exhausted. Jake was already asleep, but for some reason, the weight of everything just hit me all at once, and I started crying uncontrollably. My sobbing woke Jake up, and he immediately asked me what was wrong. I told him that I was just tired, but then I opened up about how anxious I\u2019d been feeling about his trip and being left alone with Olivia. I admitted something I\u2019ve been reluctant to say out loud\u2014that Jake hasn\u2019t been as involved as I thought he would be. This was one of my biggest fears when we found out we were having a baby. For context, Jake has a rocky relationship with his own dad. I won't go into detail about why his dad isn't the best but his mom (my mother-in-law) remarried when Jake was in middle school, and his dad wasn\u2019t very present in his life. Jake has expressed to me before that becoming a father was scary for him because he\u2019s afraid of being a bad one, just like his dad. When he first told me that, I thought it would make him into a great father, because it showed how much he cared about being a good dad long before we were even pregnant. When I vented to him about all of this, at first, he tried to defend himself. He admitted that he\u2019s been freaking out about having a baby for so long and just didn\u2019t want to tell me. He said he didn\u2019t want to stress me out while I was pregnant because he knows how much I\u2019ve always wanted to be a mother. Hearing him say that made me feel guilty, like I hadn\u2019t seen how much he\u2019s been struggling internally. I had tried to convince him that he was going to be a great dad when we had this conversation long ago, and now it all felt more complicated. I thought to myself, *This can\u2019t go on much longer.* I realized that if he was going to keep pulling away like this, I didn\u2019t know if I could handle it. So I asked him, \u201cIs this what our life is going to look like from now on? Me with Olivia and you away? Because if it is, Jake, then I don\u2019t think I can continue on like this.\u201d Jake told me to calm down and assured me that he wasn\u2019t going anywhere. Then he got really emotional\u2014he even started to tear up. He said he didn\u2019t want to turn into his dad, and that he hadn\u2019t realized that going on this trip could be a preliminary step toward becoming the absentee father he feared he might be. He apologized for not considering me and Olivia as much as he should have. Long story short, Jake called his friends and told them he wouldn\u2019t be able to make the trip. He\u2019s even started planning a little family getaway for the three of us next year when Olivia is a bit older. It was a tough conversation, but I feel like we\u2019re on the same page now, and I\u2019m hopeful that things will get better from here. Thanks again to everyone for your support and advice. It\u2019s been an emotional rollercoaster, but I\u2019m grateful for this community helping me navigate it.",

My mom died and I live in her house with my girlfriend and her child.  In my adult life my relationship has been the same with my dad. He reached out after my mom\u2019s death but he never really made the effort and it always felt that if he tried to have a relationship with me it was always for a new girlfriend or wife benefit not mine.  My dad recently had a bed wreck and his apartment only had stairs. Him and his new wife acted like they will move into my home since it\u2019s an old school ranch house. All one floor.  I told him no. He asked my why I didn\u2019t trust him and he would pay rent. I told him why would I trust him to pay rent when he never paid my mom child support for years.  His wife told me that was a rude thing to say.  I told maybe my they should ask one of her kids (she has 5) or one of my dad\u2019s 3 other kids because of 1 of 9 I\u2019m not stepping up to help because my dad has never helped me.

        "selftext": "A few days back I was out for dinner with 2 friends. Ann is pregnant currently (ca. 17 weeks), Kim is married for 3 years and currently desperately trying to get pregnant. Because Ann is pregnant, Kim cannot stand the idea of not being pregnant yet and that is all she can think or talk about. Though it doesn\u2019t interest me much (as someone who doesn\u2019t plan on ever having children), I happen to have developed a good tolerance for pregnancy/child related topics because all my friends are either pregnant or parents. During dinner they spoke only about pregnancies and childbirth (where I was hoping to catch up on other topics). I couldn\u2019t get them to talk about anything else, despite politely and subtly trying to change the topic several times. But as I understand that these topics interest them more right now, I very politely contributed to the conversation where I could, otherwise I let them talk as they pleased.  A baby started crying in our vicinity and kept crying for a while even though the mother tried to calm it down. It didn\u2019t seem hurt in any way, it seemed to be a normal cry for a baby. I noticed it start crying because it was loud and then didn\u2019t notice it anymore. I know it was crying because that\u2019s what my friends kept talking about but I tuned it out and went back to savoring my desert. The crying was like background noise to me.  But then my friends notice how I\u2019m enjoying my desert and not contributing to their conversation about how sad they feel for the baby and how it\u2019s making their heartache.  As in, they were having some sort of \u2018physical reaction\u2019 to the baby crying. I tell them that I don\u2019t hear the baby cry anymore. They asked me if I had a hearing issue, so I explained how it was like background noise to me after the first 10 seconds. Both of them looked at me in horror and pity. Kim told me that it is good I don\u2019t plan on having children because I\u2019m heartless and that my baby would be unlucky to be my baby. Ann said that she pities me that I\u2019ll never know the feeling that they both had.  I laughed at their comments because I thought that Kim wasn\u2019t very serious about her comment, and Ann is going through a few hormonal changes with her pregnancy and deserves some leniency regarding what she says to me. But they both got mad at me. According to them it wasn\u2019t something to laugh about. Neither of these comments bothered me at first, but after I posted about it yesterday, I received a lot of comments telling me that they are not good friends.  I argued in their favor because of their difficult situations. They are emotionally having a tough time, but after what happened today, I\u2019m not so sure anymore.  Kim texted me today saying that I need to start showing a little more concern towards crying children if I am to spend time with her future children. When I asked her if my heart should ache everytime a strange child cried just because I have a uterus, she called me an asshole.  So AITA for ignoring that crying child? ",

        "selftext": "About two weeks ago my 14 year old daughter Bonnie was out shopping with her best friend Gigi and Gigi\u2019s mom Lauren. While they were out, Lauren bought them both dresses she thought were cute. Except she bought Bonnie a size 3. Bonnie said she picked out one that was her size, but Lauren put it back and said that the size 3 one would be her \u201caspirational\u201d dress to work towards fitting into. When she came home, she gave it to me and was upset but also didn't want to say anything bad about Gigi's mom, which I get. First off, Bonnie is a HEALTHY girl. Gymnastics until she was about 11 (and grew several inches), dance in the fall and track in the spring, all her choices. So she's got an athletic build. Gigi is a small girl, barely 5 feet, and so I thought at first she got them mixed up. She told me that Gigi\u2019s mom got it for her to aspire to try to get into by \u201cworking hard.\u201d I said I\u2019d take care of it and get her the right size. The next day, I called Gigi\u2019s mom Lauren and asked her why she would do that. She explained that she thought it would give Bonnie something to work towards, because she heard Bonnie saying she didn\u2019t get asked out last year but Gigi had several boys after her and that it seemed like it upset her. I told her it was inappropriate and asked her why she would tell a kid she needed to lose weight in order to get attention from boys? She got defensive and said that it was obviously embarrassing for Bonnie to not have boys into her when all her friends do. She basically said I\u2019m holding Bonnie back from growing up\u2014like I won\u2019t help her with boys, won\u2019t drop hundreds at Sephora, still dress her like a kid, and buy B&BW sprays instead of fancy perfumes. She said it\u2019s messing with Bonnie socially and that she\u2019s the only one in her friend group who hasn\u2019t had a boyfriend. Then she got personal and said just because I\u2019ve \u201cgiven up\u201d and stopped trying doesn\u2019t mean I have to turn Bonnie into a nun. FOR THE RECORD, this is partially true. But it's also because Bonnie doesn't WANT that stuff. I have offered to get her more than Cetaphil skincare and she doesn't want it. She got straight As last year and I took her to Ulta for a spree and sall she wanted was some lip gloss and then ASKED for the body spray instead. I said that it\u2019s time for a break. The girls can still hang out, but I don\u2019t want Bonnie at Gigi\u2019s house. Bonnie got upset over it and I can deal with that. Gigi\u2019s mom however has gone NUCLEAR over it, spreading poison everywhere she can about me being \u201cpsycho\u201d and doubling down on how it\u2019s all because I don\u2019t want my daughter to be happy with a boyfriend when I\u2019m single and \u201cno man would touch me.\u201d Which is just\u2026 childish. And I\u2019ve been shocked to see how other people have reacted to this, so now I\u2019m questioning my own parenting which I NEVER do. AITA!?",

        "selftext": "I (26M) am getting married to my fianc\u00e9e,(let\u2019s call her Sarah (25F), in a few months, and I\u2019m super excited about it. But there\u2019s one big issue with all the planning\u2014my mom. A little background: My parents divorced when I was 8, and my mom (let\u2019s call her Layla) remarried pretty quickly after that. She married this guy, Dave, who had two kids of his own. Ever since, it\u2019s like I was no longer a priority in her life. She focused all her attention on Dave and his kids. Like, I\u2019m not exaggerating when I say she treated them way better than me. They\u2019d go on trips, she\u2019d go to all their sport events, and they\u2019d get everything they wanted. Meanwhile, I felt like I was invisible. She didn\u2019t ask about my school, didn\u2019t care about my friends, or even my mental health. I started to feel like I wasn\u2019t even her kid anymore  When I turned 18, I moved out. I thought maybe she\u2019d care and try to stay in touch, but nope\u2014she didn\u2019t. I\u2019d text her once in a while just to check in, and she\u2019d either not respond or say she was busy with Dave and his kids. I figured if she didn\u2019t care, why should I? So, I just stopped trying to reach out. Fast forward to now. I\u2019m planning my wedding, and out of nowhere, my mom starts texting me like we\u2019re super close. She wants to know all the details, saying how excited she is, and even saying things like, \u201cI can\u2019t wait to see you start this new chapter.\u201d Like\u2026 seriously? I haven\u2019t heard from her in years, and now she expects to be front and center for my wedding? I told her straight up that I didn\u2019t want her there. I said I\u2019m not comfortable with her coming after everything that\u2019s happened, and that if she really wants to have a relationship, we can talk about it after the wedding, but not before. She started crying and saying I\u2019m holding a grudge and that \u201cI\u2019m her son\u201d and \u201cshe deserves to be there.\u201d But I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m supposed to just forget the fact that she ignored me my whole childhood in favor of Dave\u2019s kids. Now, my family is split. Some of them think I\u2019m right and that I shouldn\u2019t just let her show up when she never showed up for me. Others think I should just let it go, and \u201cit\u2019s just one day\u201d and that I should let her come to the wedding to keep the peace. So\u2026 AITA for not letting my mom come to my wedding after everything that happened?",

The one thing keeping me going was the thought of having a wild night when he got home. My boyfriend\u2019s sister texted me and asked if she could come over when he got home. I said we would both be really tired and eager to be alone, and said it\u2019d be best to wait.

I don\u2019t want to complain about being small, but there are a lot of people out there (esp. other women) who will not take us seriously, are judgmental, make snide comments, assume attraction to us is nefarious, etc. A lot of comments that imply we\u2019re not real women etc. I\u2019m used to it and usually let it roll off my back. But there\u2019s a new one that\u2019s picked up momentum that I guess stems from a TV show where a girl is putting on a childish act and she says \u201cI\u2019m a very sexy baby\u201d in a cutesy voice and there\u2019s a LOT more to it that you can just Google. My SIL Cassie has picked this up and has been using this \u201cagainst me.\u201d I can\u2019t wear a cute outfit without her coming down on me and chiding me for \u201cbuying into the whole sexy baby thing\u201d when I am JUST WEARING AN OUTFIT. I\u2019m just trying to be ME. God forbid I wear a shorter skirt or bows or anything I think is cute. It\u2019s like I\u2019m not allowed to wear cute or sexy things because I\u2019m petite so I\u2019m automatically seen as trying to be a \u201csexy baby\u201d when I\u2019m not. I\u2019ve asked Cassie to stop or drop it and she maintains that I\u2019m the one opening myself up to judgment and I should dress my age. This came to a head last weekend when we were in my auntie\u2019s backyard at the pool. I took off my wrap so I could hang with my feet in the pool with my cousins and Cassie immediately said \u201cYou\u2019re a very sexy baby\u201d at me and twirled imaginary pigtails. I raised my voice and said \u201cThat\u2019s a really weird thing to keep saying. What is your problem with me? Why do you keep bringing up that I\u2019m small?\u201d She started to turn red and she yelled back again that I\u2019m the one that\u2019s choosing to walk around looking like the \u201csexy baby.\u201d I said that I\u2019m literally just wearing a bathing suit (a one piece halter) and asked her what I should be wearing instead if that\u2019s such a problem. She yelled back that I should \u201cdress like a grown adult\u201d and to stop trying to cause a scene in front of everyone. I said whatever and just tried to ignore her. Later on we ended up inside at the same time and she came down on me for calling her out in front of everyone. I told her to stop trying to make me feel bad for being small, that I didn\u2019t choose this body. She rolled her eyes and told me to grow the fuck up, and that \u201ctrying to start shit\u201d with her is even more proof. I am at a loss here and I\u2019m starting to just not want to be around my family because of her. It\u2019s not enough that I get this shit from women at work, at the gym, basically anywhere, now it\u2019s in my family. AITA for calling her out? Or even for just\u2026 idk, existing in my own body? **Edit** Hey I'm adding this in bc I can't respond to every comment, but it's my brother's wife, he doesn't care. Weve never been close/gotten along. He'll always take her side. Other people in my family are very hands off/handle your business yourself. Just the way they are.
