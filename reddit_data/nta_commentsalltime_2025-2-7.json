        "selftext": " So, I'm getting married to my fiance soon. I bought my wedding dress weeks ago. His my (FMIL) kept pestering me about trying it on but I firmly refused. I finally shut it down after she offered me 100$ to let her try it on. Her reasoning for presisting so much? She says it's because of her love for wedding dresses and her obsession with them. Fast forward to yesterday, I came home from work early and I found my fiance at home. He freaked out after seeing me and tried to prevent me from going into my room while trying to text somebody on his phone. I opened the door and was shocked to see his mom standing there wearing my dress. I instantly pulled out my phone and took a photo of her in it. Sheand my fiance freaked out after I told her that she needed to pay me for a new dress in 3 days or else I'll show the whole family the photo. She started crying and then left and my fiance blew up at me saying I can't be serious and that I overreacted because his mom just wanted to try the dress on, no harm done. But I refused to listen to him because in my opinion, the dress should only be worn by the bride and the bride only. quite frankly, I felt disgusted looking at the dress again, I don't want it anymore. And so I think it's fair that she pays me after she ruined it for me. He yelled at me. and told me to wake up and stop treating his mom like that as if she was an enemy. We had a fight after he failed to get me to back down and he's been staying with his mom since then. I felt awful, but I spent 3k on this dress and worked hard .to get it, I can't stand looking at it but people in my family think I'm escalating things and risking my relationship with not only FMIL but my fiance as well. AITA? Update: Oh My God! This blew up, and so I thought I'd add some updates. My fiance called and offered to pay for the dress himself so we can end the conflict but he wants me to : * hand him my phone so he can delete the photo himself.* Swear that I don't have any copies to use against his mom later.* Apologize to his mom.* And lastly, He asked that I quit his family group chat and log out of facebook for at least a month. I haven't responded yet. P.s He called with this offer/conditions hours ago but I didn't want to include this in the post but now I did. Also, I'm not sure if I'll agree because I don't want him to pay for it, I want his mom, the one who wore it to pay for it. Not being vicious but trying to hold her accountable.",

        "selftext": "Hi! Obviously a throwaway for privacy, also am new to posting so I hope I do this correctly! When I was 18, my dad gifted me a house with two stories. I am extremely thankful, we are not upper class but my dad bought this house for a cheap price a long time ago (it was his grandmothers cousin's house). I know that this was an extreme privilege and I am forever grateful for this.  The layout of this building is like an apartment, but it is a house. So basically, each story has its own separate entry, its own kitchen and bathroom. I live upstairs while I rent out the downstairs. My boyfriend 25m moved in with me about three months ago and we have been together for six months. I have not asked him for money, neither for utilities or to pay me any rent. The only thing he contributes to is groceries, that we split 50/50. I have not brought up that I own the building as it is not something I tell many people, if people ask me I of course tell them that I own it, but if they just assume I am a renter then they can believe that. The topic of a landlord, the renter downstairs or the owner of the building has not been something we have talked about.  This last Tuesday the renter came up to tell me that her freezer has stopped working. I answered the door and my boyfriend heard us talking I suppose. I went downstairs to take a look and we came to the conclusion that she would buy a new one, send me the receipt and I would give her the money. She was very grateful for this solution. When I went upstairs my boyfriend asked if it could be fixed, I told him no, but she was going to buy a new one and I would pay for it. He looked at me like I was crazy and asked me why the hell I would pay for her freezer, I told him that because I am her landlord and the freezer was there when she started renting, I would stand for the cost. He just asked me if I was serious, to which I said I was. He begun screaming at me, asking him why the hell I would hold this information from him and that I was an evil person. I said I was sorry for not telling him but I did not think that it would matter. He said he could not believe he was together with someone who is a landlord, that all of us just use people for money and that the only thing \u201cwe people\u201d care about is money and would rather have people be homeless then offering affordable rent. (The downstairs is 1 kitchen, 1 bath and 4 other rooms, I charge 500 dollars in rent). I understand many people have had trouble with landlords, but I try my best to be a good one. He demanded that I give him 50% of the money I make from rent or else I was just as bad as he thought. Was I really the asshole for not telling him? He has not talked to me since Tuesday and I have tried telling him that I am truly sorry but he doesn\u2019t answer me at all. Edit: obligatory edit to add that I certainly did not expect this to blow up the way it did, I have tried to read as much as I can. Thank you all for your advice and support, I have talked with him and I will update later tonight when I had have time to process everything that went down and try to write it out as best as I can. For the people who was worried about my safety, I called my dad who was sat outside in his car when I talked with my boyfriend and I am safe as of right now and hope it will continue that way. Thanks yet again to everyone Edit 2: update posted, sorry for the rushed update and weird writing, it is explained in my update as to why. Thanks yet again",

        "selftext": "Edit: ON his birthday, really should have spell checked before posting.  I (18f) have been dating my boyfriend, John (20m) for a little under a year. We have a pretty toxic free relationship but there\u2019s quite a bit of tension when it comes to me being vegetarian. I\u2019ve been vegetarian since 11 and I have very strict morals around it. The one thing John has a problem with is me refusing to spend my money on meat. Ever since I started making my own money, I swore to myself that I would never spend a cent of it on meat. On our dates, we usually spilt the bill and sometimes he pays for it all. I told him if he orders something meat-free, I\u2019d happily pay for both of us but he never does. When he pays for my food, it\u2019s when I\u2019ve spend money on the activity. Normally concerts and festivals. That\u2019s me paying \u20ac120+ on tickets and him spending maybe \u20ac50 on food His birthday was a few days ago and we went out for dinner at his favourite fancy restaurant. He got the most expensive steak they had along with a side salad and a bottle of wine. When we finished our food, I asked the waiter to spilt the bill and John looked at me shocked. He asked if I was joking and I said no. Then he told me he thought I was going to pay since it was his birthday and he didn\u2019t budget for the meal. I asked him why he thought I\u2019d pay since I\u2019ve been very clear about my rule but he couldn\u2019t give me a reason other than it being his birthday. I told him I\u2019d pay for the wine and the side salad, but he\u2019d need to pay for the steak. He was furious with me and stormed off to the bathroom. I paid for my meal, the wine and the salad and waited for him to come back. He didn\u2019t. After waiting for 20 minutes, I left. I found him sitting on a bench near where we parked the car. I asked him why he left and reminded him he needed to pay. He looked shocked when I said that and asked me if I didn\u2019t pay. I told him I\u2019d paid for everything but the meat and he lost it. He started yelling at me, telling me I was selfish, that I needed to grow up. I stayed calm and told him he needed to go back and pay. He scoffed and walked away. I ended up driving home without him. Now he\u2019s saying it\u2019s my fault that he can\u2019t show his face in his favourite restaurant since he dined and ditched. It\u2019s a pretty small restaurant so he\u2019d 100% be recognised and kicked out. So, aita? EDIT: To the people commenting about me not \u201ctreating\u201d him on his birthday, yes, I did. I even dipped into my savings for his present. EDIT 2: I did not \u201ctake him out\u201d for dinner. He was the one that suggested it.",

        "selftext": "Alright so I (22m) think this whole thing is ridiculous but my gf (21f) is really angry at me so here we go: I don't like giving my real name at places like Starbucks and similar stores where they shout out your name when the order's ready.  I can't tell you why, I have a normal, reasonably common name I like fine enough but for some reason it majorly creeps me out when a barista shouts my name through a room full of strangers. I guess it's just some (at least to me) harmless quirk I have.  So whenever I am at a store where they want your name I say it's Tom, that's literally the name I use, nothing inappropriate or outlandish just plain Tom. I know I am meant when they call it as I always use the same one so there is no confusion or anything, they yell Tom I get my drink/food and it's never been a problem till now.  A couple days ago I was at Starbucks with my new gf and ordered our drinks while she sat down, I gave them my fake name as always and when our order was ready and they shouted Tom I went and got it. My gf was a bit confused and asked me if I went and got someone else's order which is fair enough so I explained the thing to her and thought that's that but she got really angry.  She says it's really disrespectful to lie like that and that I am making everybody in the store out to be creeps who will do something bad if they know my name which is not at all what's happening I just don't like when they yell my real name so I found a harmless way to get around that. But she can't see it like that, she thinks I am a pathological liar who is way to suspicious of everyone and I need to stop. I really can't see the problem she has, it's really not that deep.  I don't think I am hurting anyone... or am I?? So yeah I am really confused by her reaction and asking myself if I am the asshole after all for some reason I can't comprehend.

        "selftext": " My husband's best friend (female) got the news of her dog's cancer days ago. My husband would call her everyday til yesterday when she visited. I opened the door for her, greeted her then led her to the living room and went into the kitchen to get a class of water after my husband asked me. I came back and didn't find them in the living room. Turns out they went into the guests room and the door was shut. I heard weeping/sobbing sounds coming from the inside. I knocked then got in and found them embracing each other crying. I stood by the door but my husband paused and told me to give them a moment. I gotta say that I did not feel comfortable with his request so I remained standing. He got up and started repeatedly telling me to get out. I told him it's my house and he can't tell me where I can and cannot stay. He got angry and told me to get out and we'll talk later but I refused. He asked what was wrong with me for not seeing how tense the situation was and for not giving them privacy. I told him that they did NOT need to shut the door for any reason nomatter what it was. We argued and she ended up leaving. He blew up at me afterwards calling me unbelievable and saying I had no respect for him and his friend who's going thtough a hard time and refusing to give them privacy. I told him how weird it was for them to shut the door just becsuse they were crying. He told me that I was petty and overbearing to act like this infront of her and stopping him from showing proper support.  Now he's completely gone radio silent and is acting like I kicked her out or treated her poorly. Some context: 1: Ages of those involved are 26Female, 28Female, and 31Male. 2: She's been his best friend/sister like for over 8+ years. 3: She tends to be very emotional and highly sensitive. 4: We don't get along because she tends to be a boundary stomper and does/says things that make me feel like I don't know my husband as much as she does. She also compares us as well. 5: Initially, I did not want her to come to the house but my husband called her and told her to come since he didn't see her after the news was received til yesterday.",

        "selftext": "My daughter, Alexandra (14F), hates any shortened version of her name. This has gone on since she was about 10. The family respects it and she\u2019s pretty good about advocating for herself should someone call her Lexi, Alex, etc. She also hates when people get her name wrong and just wants to be called Alexandra. She took Spanish in middle school. The teacher wanted to call all students by the Spanish version of their name (provided there was one). So, she tried to call Alexandra, Alejandra. Alexandra corrected her and the teacher respected it. She had the same teacher all 3 years of middle school, so it wasn\u2019t an issue.  Now, she\u2019s in high school and is still taking Spanish. Once again, the new teacher announced if a student had a Spanish version of their name, she\u2019d call them that. So, she called Alexandra, Alejandra. Alexandra corrected her but the teacher ignored her. My daughter came home upset after the second week. I am not the type of mom to write emails, but I felt I had to in this case. If matters, this teacher is not Hispanic herself, so this isn\u2019t a pronunciation issue. Her argument is if these kids ever went to a Spanish speaking country, they\u2019d be called by that name. I found this excuse a little weak as the middle school Spanish teacher actually was Hispanic who had come here from a Spanish speaking country and she respected Alexandra\u2019s wishes. The teacher tried to dig her heels in, but I said if it wasn\u2019t that big a deal in her eyes that she calls her Alejandra, why is it such a big deal to just call her Alexandra? Eventually, she gave in. Alexandra confirmed that her teacher is calling her by her proper name.  My husband feels I blew this out of proportion and Alexandra could\u2019ve sucked it up for a year (the school has 3 different Spanish teachers, so odds are she could get another one her sophomore year).

        "selftext": "My fiance M33, and I F28 are getting married in december. His mom is the intrusive type but she's nice overall and we....somewhat get along. I hate to admit that wedding planning has been an absolute nightmare. His mom wasn't willing to agree on most things, and my fiance said that since he's her only son then I should respect and appreciate this vision she has for the wedding and how it should be. She insisted to come along for wedding dress shopping. I took her with me and my mom and friends. I was so lucky to have found what I was looking for. but she picked a dress that she liked so much and said that she always pictured her son's bride in it mom and friends thought this line was creepy. I thought the dress was somewhat creepy and toooootally not my type. I apologized and thanked her for her vision but told her that I'd already decided on a dress that I had envisioned myself wearing at my wedding!. She got all pissy because of it apparently, then must've told my fiance because, he came home in the evening ranting about how I made his mom upset and turned down her help in choosing the wedding dress and excluded her from the process. I asked what process? duh it's just a wedding dress...my wedding dress so I really didn't get how she should get a say at all!. He got upset and said that this attitude of mine isn't working on him or his mom. He said that I should consider the dress his mom wanted me to buy especially knowing that both dresses weren't that much different anyway like she said but I told him yes they were different...like so much different. Anyways, We argued about it then we dropped it. Yesterday I came home and found out that he had returned my wedding dress and replaced it with the one his mom wanted. I called him and he was straightforward about what he did and why he did it. I lost it and started screaming at him. He asked me to calmn down and really give this dress a chance. I refused to even listen I screamed at him without giving him a chance to speak. He got home and we had an argument. I then went to stay with one of my friends and he kept calling and calling then texting saying that I overreacted and it's his wedding too so it wasn't cool how I screamed at him. He insisted I give this dress a chance. He went on and on about how his mom has a vision and good intentions and just wants what best for me as her future daughter inlaw. Mom is livid and has been wanting to go scream at him and his mom but my dad said that this isn't worth ruining my relationship with my inlaws. He suggested I wisen up and go with the flow but is it too much for me to be able to pick my own wedding dress without being guilted about it just to keep the peace?. AITA for my reaction? ETD Q & As I'm editing in some answers to frequent questions I get. A. The dress she picked wasn't all too crazy but just wasn't my type. B. This issue started during wedding planning and there were other things...like way too many things we didn't agree on. but this vision has been there for...quite a while. C. I AM paying for the dress obviously. D. My fiance's dad is deceased. also, his mom suffered from multiple health conditions. Has no daughters but one only son. E. He's still presisting...",

        "selftext": "I'm a software engineer, with a full time job and a side hustle of doing freelance coding work in my own time. I've always been the type to have a side hustle I put a lot of my free time into; I get really bored sitting idle. My freelance hourly rates are $60 an hour, and at my full time job, my hourly pay works out to about $40 an hour. So that's how I value my time.  Anyway, over Christmas vacation, I was staying at my parents house. My cousin was also staying over with her three young kids from Christmas to new year's. I'd been planning on doing some work on my freelance projects when I had free time; in the mornings when my family had no plans. I wasn't in any rush; I was already ahead of schedule on them all, but I didn't really have anything else to do. It was in a really rural area and it's like an hour drive to the nearest anything Then my cousin and her husband asked if I could babysit all day for three days, so they could visit some friends in the area and hang out with just adults. I said I had planned on doing freelance work at the library, and she offered to pay me to babysit. I said I could if they got close to my freelance rates. She wanted a number, and although my freelance rates are $60 I didn't feel like that was right, it was high. But I didn't want to go too low; honestly babysitting 3 kids would be harder for me than the routine coding work I had for my freelance project. I don't know a lot about kids and I've never babysat for long, and I had a feeling it would be stressful and difficult. So I said $35, which is below what I make hourly at work, and what is the bare minimum I'd value my time for, if that time is spent doing difficult work.  And she went crazy at me, saying that's a ridiculous rate for babysitting, that I was entitled and being selfish, that I'm trying to take advantage of how she didn't have other options, etc. I said that's way below what I'd be making if I had the time to do my own work, and I'd be putting off my own work to babysit.  Her husband then got mad at me saying that I was a 24 year old girl, that I'm damn near a child myself, that my time is not worth that much and it's childish to say that it was. And that I was a stupid girl for not knowing that babysitting costs like 15 an hour, when I grew up and have kids of my own I will see how stupid I was being. I was kind of done with being called stupid so I just told them I hoped they could find someone else. My mom thinks that I asked for something offensive, and my cousin and her husband obviously did too. AITA for giving that number?",

        "selftext": "Hi all.  I gave birth four weeks ago, and we decided to have a ''baby ceremony'', where everyone gets to meet our lovely daughter Charlotte.  My cousin Alice and her parents were among the guests. The first thing I'll say about her is that she has expensive taste. She's the sort of person who has a *minimum* price range for how much she spends on clothing. She doesn't own anything that isn't designer and has some items of clothing that cost thousands. She is a banker and still lives with parents so can afford the lifestyle.  It was Alice's turn to hold the baby and she was happy to at first, but suddenly Charlotte vomited on her. Alice handed Charlotte back to me and ran off crying, and spent the rest of the event crying in the car. I went to see her to apologise but she didn't want to hear any of it. My mum gave her one of her shirts which was too big for her and she felt completely upset and humiliated. Today I got a call from my mum, saying that she'd been on the phone to her sister (Alice's mum) saying that they want me to reimburse the cost of the blouse (roughly \u00a31800) since it was completely ruined.  I have said no. At the end of the day we all know what babies can be like. She took a risk wearing something so expensive knowing a baby was nearby and unfortunately it backfired. I feel bad for her but it was not my fault.  Am I doing the right thing by refusing to pay up?",

I finally gave in when I felt we were ready to take one on, and also when I felt he was ready for the responsibility that comes with one. I expected a dog or cat, but he really wanted a hamster. So we spent a little over a week prepping, helping him \u201cstudy\u201d hamster care and dedicated a sizable spot in our living room for necessities and home. We finally get around to picking one out at the pet shop, he\u2019s set on the name Sonic, but the lady ringing us up mentioned the one he picked out was a girl and that she could get him a boy if he wanted, and he just lit up and said \u201cThat\u2019s Amy!\u201d and that was that, we took Amy home.

Basically what happened was, they were picking out names and one of the names they narrowed it down to had Amy as the middle name. I made a joke of something like \u201cHey, we already have an Amy at our house!\u201d Trying to be funny, but SIL didn\u2019t think it was. I didn\u2019t think much about it at the time, but a couple of days ago she asked to come by to talk. She started off by saying the joke I made was in bad taste, I apologized for it, and then she suggested I change the name. I told her I didn\u2019t think that would go over well with my son, and then she outright demanded it be changed \u201cwhether he likes it or not\u201d because she wasn\u2019t going to have a child share the name with a hamster. I agreed to talk it over with my son to see what he thought, and of course he didn\u2019t want to, he even thought it was cool that his cousin would share her name with his hamster. I tried convincing him to rename her Sonic even, or some other Sonic character, but he didn\u2019t want that. I explained how SIL feels about this, and he felt a bit hurt because he thought he upset SIL but he really didn\u2019t want to change the name and didn\u2019t understand why they couldn\u2019t just share it. I told SIL that my son was set on Amy, and she blew up. I\u2019ll admit I got a bit defensive and reacted poorly, but I essentially told her it wasn\u2019t a huge deal, it\u2019s not like anyone is going to make the connection and by the time her child is old enough to know her name, Amy the Hamster likely won\u2019t be around. She claimed it was embarrassing because she would always know the connection in her mind, to which I simply told her if it was such a strong reminder of a hamster then maybe it wasn\u2019t a name she should use for her daughter. My brother has told me that I am being selfish for not forcing my son to pick another name, SIL obviously thinks I\u2019m TA, and my mom has said the whole thing is childish. So AITA?",

His daughter would spend time with my daughter regularly. They adore each other but she doesn't come to my house and they rarely meet up there. His wife has been diagnosed with cancer and has started treatment recently. The other day he came to drop our daughter off and asked to speak to me. He talked about his wife's circumstances then how his family won't be able to have a christmas celebration this year. He said it wasn't fair for his daughter and asked if I could include her in my family's celebration. He pointed out how the girls will have a great time together bonding and making memories, but I said I was sorry but my family's traditional celebration is a sacred thing and I do not feel comfortable including anyone else. Plus it'd be awkward having her in my home. He said that his daughter may not be family to me but she sure is to her halfsister. He asked me to stop and think about what's best for the kids here. I suggested he take his daughter to spend christmas with her grandparents (he said his parents and him are NC) and tried to cut the conversation short but he stopped me and started going on about how cruel it was for me to decline to include his daughter who's already having a hard time adjusting. I saw that he was beginning to cry so I stepped back and said I was no longer feeling comfortable having this conversation. I asked him to leave and he did but still texted me asking me to agree to let his daughter come spend christmas even offered that he stays away if that'll make me less uncomfortable, I said no and now he's calling me selfish and unfeeling. *A point worth mentioning here and that is my family are going to attend and they said that they too will not feel comfortable in this situation thus I said it'd be awkward.*",

Both are single moms and live with us currently. there's been issues about my stepdaughters asking my daughter to babysit the kids. Jessica didn't have a problem with it at first since this is what she does to earn money but since her stepsisters don't pay her much, she'd just refuse to babysit. We worked this out by having my wife take care of paying for the babysitting. I planned a family vacation for 3 days and everyone wanted to go. However, Both Monica & Leah suggested that Jessica stay home and watch the kids since Beth doesn't want her grandkids to come. They said it's because the kids are used to Jessica and hiring another babysitter would cause issues. And also said that Jessica isn't too fond of our destination but it was obvious that Jessica wanted to go. They insisted and Beth offered to pay her double and there was just..a lot of back and forth on this til I demanded they stop bringing it up. We were supposed to go last week but when everybody had bagged their bags and was time to go, Jessica found out that she didn't have her passport on her. We searched her bag then went home and searched there. Beth and my stepdaughters kept insisting that we go back to the airport or else we'd miss our flight. They insisted that Jessica stay at home with the kids. They even told the new babysitter to go home cause she was no longer needed. I refused to go and kept searching for the passport til Monica admitted that she helped Leah hide Jessica's passport to get her to stay home with the kids. I was livid I tried to get her to tell me where it was but she said Leah had it, Leah denied so I threatened to cancel the vacation that's when they gave it back. I decided to actually cancel the vacation and blew up at both of them and berated them. They stayed upstairs for a while and Beth refused to speak to me and said that I punished my stepdaughters for worrying about their kids and wanting them to stay with someone they know. I got told I overreacted and ruined the trip for everybody. Editing to mention that kicking my stepdaughters out isn't possible since my wife co-owns the house that we currently live in.",

        "selftext": "My girlfriend is an incredibly picky eater. Like I said in my title, she eats like she is 10 years old. In fact I'll give a short list of things she refuses to eat; Unflavored water, fish (excluding fried shrimp), anything with bones, cheese other than sharp cheddar, spinach, onions, garlic, pasta without red sauce, eggs, spicy food, aioli, ketchup, potatoes (other than french fries), pastries with fruit, citrus, sausage or any non-American food. This compares to me, someone who grew up in multiple different regions of the US and lived in abroad for a few years, so I'm a bit more adventurous when it comes to food. Whenever me and my girlfriend go out somewhere nice she ends up getting the same meals usually either a burger or chicken tenders and fries. We could be going to an authentic Nepalese restaurant and she will get the french fries and white rice. To me it's kind of embarrassing to go to a restaurant where there is a dress code and for her to order chicken tenders and fries. It especially bothers me that since I typically pay, I end up paying 15 bucks for chicken tenders that I could get from the freezer section at Walmart for 5 bucks. Recently in our area a very nice dinner place opened up and my girlfriend has been dying to go. I took a look at the place and the menu and saw that it looked nice but the food was kind of pricy. She said she was probably gonna get chicken tenders as per usual. I asked her what's the point of going then if I can toss some tenders in the air fryer for her and not spend a ridiculous amount of money on it. She asked why I had an attitude about this and I told her that I thought it was a waste of time and money to go to a nice place to get little kid food. She interpreted this as me calling her a little kid. I clarified that I wasn't calling her a child, however it is kinda childish for her to eat the way she does. I also said that if she's gonna order food we can make at home theres not aby point in us going anywhere. This lead to an argument about me thinking I'm better than her. Aita?",

        "selftext": "Throwaway because my sister knows my reddit and I don't want this causing drama Yesterday, My sister hosted a family dinner at her house. It was one of those just because dinners, no special occasion. My sister is a great cook and she made tons of food for that one night. My daughter, was on her second plate by the end of the night. Once she finished she asked if she could get another one. I said yes. But my sister (her aunt) looked at her with a shocked expression and said Another plate?. My daughter turned around and gave a somewhat un comfortable look. My daughter is 16, and has 2 part time jobs to pay for some of her college tuition, so she usually doesn't eat until 7-8pm. So I didn't even blink twice when she got up to grab her 3rd plate. I turned to my sister and said she's been working all day without anything to eat, you made tons of food, it won't hurt for her to get another plate. My sister started yelling saying something about how it wasn't my place to say if my daughter could get more of her food that she made. Now I do somewhat agree with that, and might be the A-hole because of that. Looking back I'm thinking maybe I should have asked?  My daughter ended up not getting another plate, and the vibe was awkward now so we just decided to go. Before we left out the door my sister stopped me and told me I should've taught my daughter manners and how it isn't right to get more than 1 plate at someone else's house. I told my sister she was being ridiculous and somehow our voices got loud enough where my mom started to hear us in the small corner, she came over and started telling me she agreed with my sister and it was rude for my daughter to eat that many plates. I started to get fed up when they began telling me I wasn't teaching her proper manners, so I left. Then of course they began texting my phone saying how it was rude to leave in the middle of our conversation. I don't think I was the A-hole at all for leaving because I wasn't going to stay in a place where I felt disrespected. But i'm not sure about the plate thing.  So am I the A-hole for assuming my daughter could get another plate?",

After that we got 2 hotel rooms (one for me and Candace, one for the girls). While I was in the room, I got a call from Shiloh at 11pm crying and sounded like she was arguing with her stepsisters. I asked what the matter was and she told me that her stepsisters insisted that she sleep on the floor (there were one large bed in the room and there was enough space for all 3 girls to sleep on). I asked why and she said she didn't know. I went to see what the issue was and talked with my stepdaughters about it. They kept talking but didn't really explain why they told her to sleep on the floor. They just shrugged and said It's better this way...we're more comfortable this way... I told Shiloh to grab her things and when one of my stepdaughters asked where we were going, I told her I was booking her a hotel room. Both looked upset but didn't say anything but they must've called their mom because she was awake when I got back and started arguing with me about giving Shiloh an entire hotel room for herself. I explained why I did it but she said I wasted money and that Shiloh could've sucked it up for one night on the floor. I called her unreasonable for saying this but she told me I showed the girls that I'm playing favorites and made my stepdaughters share a room while I gave my daughter and entire room for herself. We went home and Candace is still bringing it up saying I mishandled this. She even pointed out how my stepdaughters are upset since they're not speaking to me. ETA It was Candace who got a room for the 3 girls as to not stir any drama and save money. She was in charge of hotel reservation since I was emotionaly distressed. Also. Candace did NOT expect Shiloh to sleep on the floor. She wanted all 3 girls to share the bed.  ETA#2 For those that are calling me an ah for giving my daughter her name. Her mom did that and she's deceased so please let's not focus on that. And also, I've known my stepdaughters since they were little. We're pretty much family and Candace is a sahm but I give her full access to my money since this stuff was already discussed before handed. Pretty much everything was.",

        "selftext": "When I was 25, we found out that my father had been cheating on my mother for years and he had a 7 year old daughter with his mistress. In one split second, the happy family I knew was gone, and I went through the darkest time in my life. My parents divorced and per their prenup, my mother walked away with most of their assets (since she also contributed more to the family income). She never forgave my dad for what he did and never talked to him again, though she grudgingly allowed me to have whatever relationship I wanted to have with him. I eventually forgave my dad mostly because I was tired of carrying so much anger and hurt in my heart. I talk to him but I want nothing to do with his mistress or my half sister. My mother died last year and left me everything - her money, her real estate assets, and her business, which I now own and operate. I am in a relatively comfortable financial position, while my dad is... getting by. He was never a good businessman on his own and lost a lot of his money on businesses that later went belly up. This year my half sister was diagnosed with a life threatening sickness, and she has been in the hospital for the last four months. The bills are mounting and my dad came to me for help because they are now in a situation where they are finding it difficult to come up with money for my half sister's treatment. The thing is, I don't want to use my mother's money to pay for the treatment of the child her husband had with his other woman. Though it's not my half sister's fault, it feels so unfair when I think that the money my mother worked hard all her life for will go to a child that neither my mother and I have any responsibility towards, and the very same child of the man and the woman who hurt her so much at that. I'd really rather use it to grow her company and let my dad and my half sister's mother figure out how to get money for her treatment. They are her parents after all. The only thing tying me to her is my father saying She is your sister and If she dies because she didn't get the treatment she needs, would you be able to sleep at night? AITA?",

After a long conversation I agreed to go vegetarian and be vegan in the house and around her, which she was happy with. She also decided our son should be vegan, which after seeing a dietician I also agreed with. Things have been fine with this arrangement until a few months ago when I began finding wrappers from nonvegan candy and even burgers from McDonald's in my sons school bag which he had been buying with chore money. I had a conversation with my son and he confessed he felt lonely and excluded eating vegan around his friends and that they always had much better candy than he did and it wasn't fair. I decided I didn't want him spending his pocket money on snacks and throwing out the vegan snacks we actually brought him instead of buying games etc, it made no sense, but I also know the way my wife feels about nonvegan products. So, I began buying my son what he wanted on our way to football practise instead. Long story short, my wife recently found out what has been going on and completely flipped out. She called me an animal abuse enabler and a few other names and said I was corrupting our son.

She left at around 7:45. 10:15 rolled around and she still wasn't home. I texted and she apologized to me, saying that her friend's son was actually in the next town over (maybe 30 minutes away) and she was coming home now. 11:45 rolled around and she still hadn't come home, so I called her to no answer. Texted her to no response. I was getting very upset 12.30 rolled around and still no response and no answer to my phone calls. I was extremely angry.  1:30 rolled around and my anger had completely transformed into worry. Not answering my calls and texts not read. Around 1:45 I called the police. I have always heard that the first 24 hours of someone being missing is the most important, so I didnt want to delay. I asked them to let me know if there had been any traffic accidents involving her car, and the operator told me that they would put out the word and send some cops to check along the route she would travel. I called all the hospitals in the area to check if she has been checked in and I waited outside watching the road for her car for three hours, partially because I didn't want the kids to hear me on the phone with hospitals, and secondly because I was sick with worry. At 7:00am she came home. She apologized for being out and said she had no excuse. She was driving home and felt tired like she was falling asleep at the wheel, so she pulled over to the side of the road to sleep. When she did that, she found that her brand new phone had stopped working. She says she napped anyway because it was the responsible thing to do, and then came home at 7am to bring the kids to school and get to work on time.  I immediately called the police and told them that she had come home safely and gave them the case number and told them to stop searching, which they did.  My fjance brought the kids to school and left for work. I set out to start cleaning (cleaning destresses me sometimes), and I got a call from a policeman asking where she worked. I told him, and asked why, and I was informed that it was their policy to check on the person's wellness after a missing person is found. I asked them to not go by her work but to give her a call instead. He said he couldn't promise.  My fiance is relatively new to her job. A police officer showed up and asked to speak with her. She is now enraged at me for calling the police and 'sending a cop to her work' and making her look bad. She is saying I overreacted and that she wasn't missing and that I was punishing her for doing the responsible thing and not driving while drowsy. She is saying that she is never going to leave the house again except for work, because she is afraid I'm going to call the cops on her again.  So did I overreact? Should I have waited two days like she suggests? EDIT: Thanks for informing me everyone. I am aware that my ex is posting deranged nonsense in the comments. I won't respond to them because I've made it a policy not to engage with her.",

Now we've been arguing about my wedding dress, This might sound clich\u00e8 but eversince I was young I dreamed of having my own beautiful wedding dress, I can afford it but my STBH thinks it's not okay to waste a couple of thousands on a dress I'm only going to wear once -- yes he might have a point there but for one, this is typical price for wedding dresses. and two, because it's a once in a life time thing then why not make sure it's special? STBH still wasn't convinced, and suggested I rent a dress instead of buying one. He started saying that I'm being irrisponsible with money and brought up how much money I've already put aside to rent a face (he means makeup) and wear fake hair (he means extension) but I have this vision of what I want to...look like, sort of speak, on my wedding and I think that it's my right as a bride. I went ahead and purchased the dress but a day later I found out that it was missing from my closet. I freaked out but he told me he returned it and got the money back. I was shocked I asked him why he did that and he said he thought the dress was ridiculously expensive and that was wasting money and AGAIN suggested I go rent one. I blew up and went off on him which I've never done before. He literally took few steps back and told me to calm down. I said he had no right, I'm the one paying for the damn dress. He got upset and said that there's no I'm paying for it myself in marriage and that my attitude is setting the tone for what type of dynamic we'll have in our marriage, he kept on about how I must expect to him to pay for everything while I keep my money or spend it irresponsibly (but I never tell him how to spend his money) I responded that he gets zero say in how I spend my money whatsoever. he told me that I should grow the f up and stop with the dream wedding dress clich\u00e8 then stormed off to call his mom who chewed me out saying she won't let me ruin her son's financial stability with how I deal with money generally. She too urged me to rent a dress or buy cheaper one, way cheaper than the one I picked and move on but I declined. ETA for repeated questions: Yes, he still has the money and said he'll give it back once we agree to a solution.",

We learned how to substitute ingredients, cook new things, try new things, I adjusted our budget to include more expensive vegan substitutes for her, etc.  None of this has been a problem for me until recently. She saw me cook bacon in a pan, and then I rinsed it out to load in the dishwasher. She exploded in anger (teen years, I\u2019m not too fussed about the anger explosion, I know she doesn\u2019t mean it) and said that that was HER pan for vegan food. I was completely floored and said, kiddo this here is a family pan, older than you, it\u2019s not YOUR pan.  She asked me to purchase her a pan that she can solely use for vegan food. I didn\u2019t want her to feel weird about food, so I said sure, and ordered her a few colored ones that are only for her. The reason they\u2019re colored is so it helps me remember that I\u2019m not to touch them unless I\u2019m cooking vegan.  That wasn\u2019t good enough. Now apparently the dishwasher is \u2018contaminated\u2019 with animal product, and the fridge has \u2018bacon grease fingers\u2019 on it (because I eat bacon and then touch the fridge) and she\u2019s asked me and her mom to completely stop eating meat at home. I don\u2019t mean I literally touch the fridge with greasy bacon hands, because I wash my hands, but it\u2019s clearly enough that it upsets my daughter.  frankly I\u2019m on team hell no, her mom is much more amenable and strongly wants me to consider taking our daughter up on the request. My wife\u2019s reasoning is that both our parents live close so we can eat meat products there, and that she doesn\u2019t want our daughter to feel uncomfortable in the kitchen. My daughter says she is fine with cheese and butter in the fridge, but it\u2019s specifically meat products that make her feel sick. Now I\u2019m sorry for her, but I feel like she just needs to adapt and live side by side, because I\u2019m not going to stop eating bacon in my own house.",

        "selftext": "I have several dogs, one of which is an American Akita. His name is Yankee. I thought it was funny, and he seems to like his name. My sister was in the states the past two years and recently flew home with her boyfriend in tow. First time we've met him, yada yada. I guess she never mentioned me or my dogs, but he was pretty surprised when I told him my dogs name. I didnt think much of it - most of my pets have peculiar names so I assumed it was just an overall reaction.  They left, my partner and I had dinner. Part way through our food my sister called and asked if I'd consider changing my dogs name. I kind of thought she was kidding, but she reiterated that she was serious. The name yankee had upset her boyfriend, quite badly, and he found it offensive. I basically told her to fuck off and tell him to grow up, before going back to my food. The following day they literally show up at my door. I was kind of taken aback - apparently they came to tell me why the name yankee was so awful.  During this discussion he told me it was essentially a slur used against Americans, and asked if I would ever name a dog the n word. I just kind of laughed and told him he was off his nut. Its not that serious. You cant equate the word yankee to something like the n-word. I told him I wasnt going to change my dogs name - he knows it, it'd be a shit ton of work. He's personal protection so it could even damage his work.  They, thankfully, left, but still seemed pretty upset. Thinkinh back now I'm pretty sure theres a company with yankee in the name? I wonder how many letters of complaint he's sent. Anyway, I did message my American friends just to make sure I wasnt being a prick. They all agreed he was being stupid, but I know the US is huge and it might be more of a regional thing? So I'm still not sure. I am starting to feel kind of asshole-ish for not taking him seriously when it may be a genuine issue for him. So, I come to reddit. Two birds, one stone, I know a large amount of Americans frequent this subreddit. Am I am asshole, and is this an issue in the states that I should apologise for? ETA: I had a shower at 70 comments and now we're nearly at a thousand? I cant keep up with them I'm sorry \ud83d\ude2d Anyway, I think he's from the south, and my sisters a tory so he's more than likely a republican.  Eta from my partner; Since this post is gaining traction I want to play a game. We are currently trying for a baby - what are some potential baby names we could mention to him? Just to, you know, upset him a little. We do already have our names picked but no one else knows that.",

My wife makes less money than me and is the type of people who prefers to make her own gifts for people. The issue is she will do this even if the person doesn't want this.I will use myself as an example. For the past few years she has made every single gift I have been given. No matter what I asked for I get a homemade gift, doesn't matter if it is cheap or not. Last Christmas I asked for a new a few things and I got a homemade scarf. I always get her stuff she want. I have talked to her about this multiple time. My birthday was yesterday and I asked her to give me a book. It was only 25 dollars and I sent her the link. I opened the gift and she made some homemade bookmarks. It wasn't even the type oof bookmarks I like. They were made from fabric and I like the wooden ones.  I must have made a face because she asked what was wrong. I told her I didn't want these. I made it so clear what I actually wanted and I have talked to her so many times. I handed them back and went out to buy the book. We had a big fight when I got back, she claims I am being ungrateful and a jerk.  ",

        "selftext": "My (29f) friend, let\u2019s call her Emily (32f) is an amazing person - she\u2019s fun, adventurous, intelligent, super active, a fantastic cook, outgoing and just a great girl to be around. A few years ago she decided not to shave anymore (legs, armpits, female areas) out of protest to the patriarchy, resulting in her having very long dark hair everywhere.  A few days ago, we were having a beer and she told me how sad her dating life was, that she kept meeting guys and having very fun dates but never got a call back or when she tried asking for a second or third date, got rejected in a very generic manner. Now after telling her \u201cyou\u2019re so gorgeous and wonderful, the right man will come don\u2019t worry\u201d multiple times, I decided to go out on a limb and said something along the lines of \u201cI know this is a very superficial thing to say, but do you think it might help a little if you would shave?\u201c  She was very taken aback and told me she was disappointed I would suggest she change her appearance for men and that I was the reason so many women were suppressed. I immediately apologized but the evening was pretty much ruined. I texted her the next day apologizing again for hurting her but she hasn\u2019t replied. I really did not want to hurt her but I also don\u2019t quite see how my comment was that bad so I am not sure how to phrase my apology. So decided to take it here and ask people here how big of an AH I am. UPDATE: I am absolutely overwhelmed by the amount of reactions this got. Thank you all so much for your well-worded answers and for your inputs. Emily messaged me yesterday evening asking if we could talk about the whole thing and we had a phone call.  She started by apologizing for her reaction and by the things she said to me. I told her that I wanted her to know that I and many others love her for who she is and the last thing I wanted was to suggest that she change herself for a guy. Another important piece of advice I got here was to make sure she actually was asking for my opinion and not just venting, so I told her that I was very worried I had given her unsolicited advice. Thankfully she didn\u2019t see it that way. She told me I had always been a loyal friend who had her back and she always had valued my advice, which was why she was so taken aback by my comment. I told her that what I should have said is that I feel like in the past, she has been attracted to men who don\u2019t necessarily share her values, and that she might need to be more clear with her dating choices and first make sure they align with her values to avoid being disappointed. She also agrees with this and we really had a great conversation after that. Thanks again to you all for the insightful comments and for your help!",

With our wedding approaching, He asked if I'd consider wearing flat shoes at the wedding. I was confused, like very confused I asked if he was joking but he went on a rant about how doesn't want to be made fun of on his own wedding. and that if I choose to wear high heels then we will look 'awkward' in the photos and infront of the guests. I refused and he kept calling me selfish and inconsiderate and said that I prioritized a bare of high heels over his comfort and happiness for the big day.  He had his mom involved and she is pushing me to reconsider. When I refused to discuss it she said that my unwillingness to cooperate is a huge indicator of my level of maturity, she then went on a long rant about what lengths 'real wives' are willing to go to to help out their husbands and said that I'm apparently too immature and shallow to be committed in a marriage if I make such an issue out of it. Am I being selfish? It's not just about what I want but the high heels help make the wedding dress look better and I feel like I deserve to look my best at my own wedding just like every bride's dream. His insecurity is preventing me from getting that. AITA?   Edit, typos ). To clarify, I'm slightly taller but he said he doesn't want me to look any taller than that. *answering some questions* ). (1). The gusts he was talking about are his male friends, and the men in his family. They comment on his height all the time, call him names from shorty, koala, Lil D, hobbit and the list is long. They even have a list of jokes about him. (2). Like I said, I'm slightly taller and he doesn't want me to be any taller. (3). We had similar arguments about this height issue before but this is the first time he asks me to not wear heels. Other times he lets me wear them but sometimes refuses to attend events with me. (4).

        "selftext": "I (38M) have a 19 year old daughter Ariel with my ex-wife Lauren (39F). We had Ariel too young, and it was a huge struggle. We moved into Lauren\u2019s family\u2019s. I was working multiple jobs. Me and Lauren were best friends thru all this. But things ended when Ariel was 2. Lauren\u2019s friend Tori (38F) told me that Lauren had been messaging guys and when they went out she would give out her number. I checked Lauren\u2019s phone and found it. I asked for a divorce, Lauren was pissed and wanted to reconcile. I didn\u2019t and got split custody.  Lauren made my life hell. Lauren badmouthed me, would miss pick up times and make decisions without talking to me. Her dad offered money to relinquish custody, I told him off. Ariel is now 19 and just started college. The deal was me and her mom would split it.  I remarried Tori when Ariel was 6. Tori was a rock during the divorce but we didn\u2019t date till 2 years later. Lauren used this to warp Ariel against Tori and our son (13M). She excludes them. Whenever she spends the night she will just talk to me or go to her room if my family was around. Our son walks to the basement if she comes over. It hurts me a lot. I\u2019ve spent thousands on therapy before people bring that up. It still is being utilized. But at this point Ariel is being nasty for the sake of it. Her mom has convinced her I cheated with her friend and had a baby. Which is funny because as I\u2019ve pointed out. The timelines don\u2019t even match up. I\u2019ve done everything at this point including family time, 1 on 1 and therapy. Ariel is plain rude to them and they are done trying.  Ariel graduated from HS in may and hosted a party. I was invited but my family wasn\u2019t. I told Ariel I found that disrespectful. So I\u2019d send a card but wouldn\u2019t be going. She didn\u2019t care and we haven\u2019t spoken since. I get a call from Lauren saying she paid the first semester and was wondering when I\u2019d be paying. I said I was no longer paying. As I\u2019m not pulling money out of my household, when Ariel is disrespectful to 2/3rds of it. My ex went off. Saying we had an agreement. I reminded her of when her dad tried to buy my custody. And said \u201cyou have what you\u2019ve always wanted. Full control and custody. You won. So figure it out\u201d. Then texted her that I\u2019ve been putting up with this long enough. She got her 18 years of child support from me. So until she planned on setting the record straight that I was done with both of them. And blocked her. I called Ariel and told her the same. Gave the reasons I\u2019m not paying and told her she needed to look into loans. But I would pay for college if she at least tried to form a bond with my family because she created this situation with her attitude. So if she wants my help, she needs to attempt it. She started crying. But I didn\u2019t fall for it. Told her what my expectations were and to let me know what her plan is so I can move the money around. My wife is on my side here. Saying we\u2019ve been the bad guys for long enough. But I\u2019m getting shit from others. AITA?",

        "selftext": "I 23m was repeatedly stuck playing the part of helper and babysitter on family outings. I had to move out of my parents' house because I kept being forced to help watch my three nephews. Last year we took a family vacation in summer to the coast. I rode along with my parents, and they paid for my hotel room. Only, I had to share that room with three rowdy boys because my sister and her husband wanted a room to themselves. I was promised time to do my own things on the vacation. But instead I ended up having to help with these kids. I complained to everyone about it, and was reminded I was there for free. And then we pretty much just did only one thing I wanted to do. Which was tour an art gallery. I like doing this whenever I'm at the coast. But the kids find it boring. This year my parents have a beach trip planned for June. And they assumed I'd be riding along the same way as last year. But I refused. I said I'd be driving myself, and paying for my own hotel stay to have my own room. My parents were shocked, and tried to remind me of the cost. I said it was no worry. I've got a good job and a decent running car. I can more than afford it. That's when the Buts started. I stated the previously listed things as why I'll be driving myself and paying for myself. I want to be able to enjoy this vacation as an adult, and not be treated like a child like last year. My parents told my sister, and she called to blow up at me that I'll be ruining the vacation if I'm off doing my own thing while she has to wrangle her three boys. I ended up yelling at her that last year all she did was rope me into her mess. I didn't really get to do much of anything I wanted to do. And I was treated like the bad guy for wanting to just go to an art gallery. I'm a grown man. I deserve my own vacation too. Now my sister is not speaking to me, and my parents are still trying to convince me to just ride with them to keep the peace. I'm still refusing. But the pressure is getting to me. AITA for not giving in? I know they'll have a pretty hard time when they won't have another person there to help. Edit: It's barely been an hour since I posted. But my sister is apparently a reddit lurker in the mornings, and she saw my post. Not only is she furious with me. But she's also upset no one in the comments is siding with her. To make it short, she went on a big rant about how it's so hard to be a parent to triplets. And the least I could do is help because I'm young and single, and she needs a break. I stood my ground on my decision, and now she's calling our parents to get them involved. I'm expecting a call from them any minute. Update: Well I'm off work now, so I can tell more of what went down. I guess you could say it's over. My sister got our parents involved, they looked at my post, and were absolutely horrified by the continuous influx of commenters. Yes they're very angry with me that I posted here. But I told them that if they'd just listened to me to begin with, I'd have never needed to. I'm sick of the whole keep the peace mentality that sacrifices me to placate my sister. They in turn went off on my sister, and to make a long story short the whole vacation has been canceled. The hotel wasn't booked yet anyway. But my parents are arguing with my sister, my sister is blaming me, and my nephews are crying because they aren't going to the beach. My sister called me at lunch and basically implied I have no life, which is why I have time to help. I recorded that and told our parents, and that's currently what they're fighting about. Smol Update: I wasn't gonna update again. But here's a little more. Parents said that they won't ever push babysitting of my nephews on me again, and have agreed that what happened last year was unfair to me. Right now they're VERY angry with my sister for telling me I should help her because she thinks I have no life. My sister is playing the victim. And my brother in law is basically saying Nope! to the whole mess and spending most of his time at work.  Thank you to everyone who has commented. You made my day.",

        "selftext": "I (20) am a mother of triplets whom are only 2 months old. I never expected ever in my life that I'd be a mother to triplets so when I first became pregnant it was definitely the last thing in my mind.  I'm home with my babies all day long and had to even transfer my education to online.  Sometimes I just need some fresh air especially when I can't get them to stop crying and I find myself getting super frustrated to the point of tears, it's honestly soo hard and the dad isn't here to help as he's ether at work or at school.My fiance's (24) parents rented us a main floor apartment so when I step outside I'm literally just sitting on the chair right beside the door plus I have a baby monitor step up in their room and it has a camera on it I can literally see them and hear them so if anything happened I'd be able to quickly get to them.  Being able to step outside for a few minutes to take a breather is really important to me because I start to have mini panic attacks when I can't get them to stop crying and I get really frustrated because I just feel super overwhelmed, Being able to go outside just gives me a chance to clam down.  My fiance came home to me sitting outside while the babies were crying and freaked out on me calling me a horrible mom and a bunch of other names that I'm not gonna list here. He thinks that I was being super neglectful and putting the babies in harm way and even told his parents and now everyone seem to be really against me.  I grow up in the system my fiance's family is the only family I have and ever known so it breaks my hurt that they are so upset with me but I really don't think I was doing anything wrong or putting my babies in harm way but they seems to think otherwise. So here I am wondering if I should apologize for my actions or if I am the A-hole in this situation. ~~~~~~~~~ Update ~~~~~~~~~ I decided to show my fiance this thread at first he was really upset with me for sharing our personal problems with strangers on the internet even though it's anonymous.  But in the end when he had a chance to clam down and hear me and all of you guys out he actually apologized and promised me he'd be more involved with parenting and even is willing to take parenting classes which I'll hold him to that.  I just wanna thank everyone for the support that you all give me it brought tears to my eyes (happy tears) seeing how supportive you all were to a stranger on the internet I don't think I ever received this much support before.  I can't believe how much attention this post even got plus the award again thank you so much.",

        "selftext": "I have a good job, I make good money and I work hard enough to earn it. To the point that about 4 years ago after our son was born when my wife decided not to go back to work I became the only source of income.  This worked out well and everyone was happy until COVID hit. Once the pandemic started causing shut downs my role was transitioned from in an office downtown to working from home. I was a big fan of this. I work 5am to 7pm Mon to Sat typically so not having to commute meant that now I got to be home to put my son to bed and read to him at night and have more time to spend with my wife in the evenings. The only problem is that my wife has struggled with the idea that the location of my job has changed but my responsibilities have not. I've had several discussions with her about the fact that even though I'm home now I'm not able to watch our son during the day, or explaining why I can't get to the dishes till that evening. She will nod along to but I don't think she really believes it. This has caused tension but not an outright fight until this week. Some of our mutual friends are coming into town this weekend and we had made plans to spend time with them. However, on Monday my wife informs me that the couple is actually getting in Friday and she and her friend are going to get lunch and go shopping. She tells me that I will need to watch our son. I respond by saying again that I can't, I have work and Monday to Friday is not enough heads up for me to take a day off. She gets angry at me saying she watches our son everyday while I just sit in my office from sun up to sun down and how I should be able to watch our son so she can have a day off. She's given me the cold shoulder since then. I would love to spend the day with my son I just can't take the time off on such short notice. AITA?",

        "selftext": "So the judgement is pretty much exactly as the title suggest. I will provide context tho. So I (28M) have been married to my wife for 4 years and we have a 2 year old son together. My older sister Ariel has 2 kids with her husband. She is my only sibling but we do not speak and haven\u2019t since my wedding 4 years ago. My wife knew I had no relationship with my sister or mother whenever we got together but now it\u2019s causing an argument.  We were a pretty typical family until my mom cheated my senior year of high school with a coworker. My dad moved out immediately and I moved with him. This caused the riff between me and my sister. My sister believed since my mom was sorry and it was a one time thing (as she claimed which I don\u2019t for a second believe) and was trying to reconcile thru the church that me and my dads refusal to speak with her was somehow wrong. I was 18 and my sister was 20. Long story but eventually my sister stopped speaking with my dad. I haven\u2019t seen my mom since 2016 and we have only spoken once since in 2019 when she tried to invite herself to my wedding. She was not invited but my sister was out of courtesy. My sister didn\u2019t show up and we have not spoken since. My wife knew when she married me that my only family was my dad and my cousins. She said it was okay and she didn\u2019t care. So a few months ago my wife got a call from my sisters husband (I\u2019ve never met him) and he said that he wanted to start mending the bridge and would like to have me come meet their kids. I said no. Well then my sister started sending pics of her kids to my wife and my wife sent pictures back. I told her multiple times I did not like this and she told me she could send pics to whoever she wants. I said that if she keeps testing my boundaries she will be a single parent really soon. That she signed up for me as is. My wife is saying it\u2019s wrong to deprive my son of his family. I said I don\u2019t even have a relationship with my sister or BIL so why should my kid? That doesn\u2019t make me feel comfortable at all and I don\u2019t even know these people. Also any pic she sends could easily be forwarded to my mom and she needed to think about that. She said she doesn\u2019t even understand why my mom can\u2019t meet her kid and that comment alone pissed me off because I\u2019ve explained my family drama for years and it feels like she just ignored it. I said she really needs to think about who she wants to appease because I\u2019m not gonna stand for disrespect of my boundaries. My dad totally agrees with me and is telling me I should start setting aside money now for a exit strategy. Because my wife\u2019s behavior is exactly how my mom used to act and I should see the warning signs now. AITA?",

        "selftext": "My wife and I have three children. They are 17, 15, and 10.  My oldest has no intention to do anything after high school.  At least none he has made clear to us.   So I gave him the same ultimatum my parents gave me.  Either go to university, get a job, or GTFO.  I chose to travel the world for two years. I had a lot of sailing experience and my father had a lot of friends in that community so I was able to sail around the world earning money and working my ass off.  It wasn't a two year vacation.   My family is well off and I could have chosen an indolent life.  But I knew I would be a disappointment if I chose that.  So when I got back I enrolled in university and eventually went to work for the family business.   My wife thinks that I'm being unfair to our poor baby boy throwing him out into the world.  I'm not. We have the money to pay for his university.  We have the money for all three kids.   My middle child will probably end up with a good chunk of it in her pocket.  She is on track for an academic as well as a golf scholarship.   The 10 year old is 10 and who knows what's he's going to do.  But he knows the plan.  We have not been secretive about this rule.   My wife and I agreed that we would raise productive members of society before we got engaged.   Her and my son think I'm being cruel to expect him to fend for himself at 18.  I have offered him multiple opportunities to do other things.  He has no interest in anything beyond his computer.  I am at a loss. I don't think I'm wrong for expecting an adult to adult.  My parents have already told him that they will not be giving him any money if he isn't in school or working. My wife is threatening to use her salary to support him. I don't have any say in that.  I won't actually kick him out of the house but I will stop paying his bills and cut off our grocery budget by 20%.  If she wants to work so he doesn't have to there is nothing I can do about that.",

        "selftext": "She\u2019s my fianc\u00e9e right now but the argument we\u2019re having is that once we\u2019re married, she wants her name on the house deed. Years ago, I bought several acres as soon as I could afford it. Back then it was part of a ranch surrounded by other ranches. The owner needed money so he parceled out this section and sold it to me. I built a small house on it and have lived in it ever since. Since it was originally part of a ranch, I did enough to legally keep it classified as a ranch so the property tax is extremely low.  Over the years, companies started to move to the neighboring big city and land prices started to go up. Almost all of the ranchers sold their lands to developers so now there are huge houses surrounding mine. They start from $500,000 and go to several million. None of them sit on even an acre of land. My house is clearly the worst house around and I have no doubt it\u2019s bringing the value of nearby houses down.  That\u2019s all happened before I met and dated my fianc\u00e9e. Now that we\u2019re engaged, we\u2019re talking seriously about our finances and the only sticking point is the house. She wants her name on the deed once we\u2019re married because we\u2019ll be sharing our lives. Alternatively, she wants me to sell the house and we purchase a house together. I don\u2019t find either options attractive. In our state, whatever we bring to the marriage we take out. Since I will be bringing the house into the marriage, I can leave with it should things not work out. If I put her name on it, then she\u2019ll get half. If I sell the house, there\u2019s no way I\u2019ll be able to afford anything that\u2019s even close to what I have now. Not to mention our property tax will be several times higher. Then there\u2019s the drive time. My house is 30 minutes away from my work and 40 from hers. House prices has gone up so much that we\u2019ll have to move at least an hour away from our jobs.  Like I said, we agreed with or compromised on everything else. This one issue is the only sticking point and it\u2019s becoming a big one. So much so that she brought her family into it. This weekend her father took me out to dinner to have a man to man talk. He told me that if we\u2019re going to join our lives, we have to join everything. He expects me to do the right thing if I want to join their family. So now it\u2019s her entire family on one side and me by myself on the other. Am I wrong to want to keep the house I built by myself to myself? Edit 1 to answer a good question: Neither of us are rich. I bought the land at a very low price but now it\u2019s worth 10 times as much. Even if I offer to sell half of it to her at its current value, there\u2019s no way she can afford it. That\u2019s why if we buy a house together, we\u2019ll have to move far from here and our jobs in order to get one we can both afford. Edit 2 to answer some common questions: In all, I spent about $200,000 to buy the land and build the house. Everything is paid off and I pay the extremely low taxes every year. The tax assessment on my property is about $2 million. I don\u2019t know anything about refinancing but at our salary level, I highly doubt we would qualify. In fact, we\u2019ve spoken to a real estate agent and with a 20% down, our salary qualifies us for a $300,000 house. The property tax on a $300,000 house is many times the currently tax I pay now. I\u2019m comfortable with us living in my house and paying all the taxes and maintenance by myself. Edit 3 to answer a common question: Many are asking about my compromise and pointing out her lack of financial security. My compromise is that we live in my house and I will pay all of the taxes, bills, and maintenance costs. Based on our conversation with the real estate agent, if we buy a $300,000 house, her half of the mortgage would be about $1,300 not including her half of the property tax and down payment. I pointed out to her that if I pay for everything toward my current house, she would be saving at least $15,600 a year over 30 years on the mortgage alone. That doesn\u2019t include the money she would be saving not paying the down payment and property tax. In my mind, that would give her plenty of financial freedom and security. Also, if I sell the land, I don\u2019t want to buy any new house outright with that money. The reason we went to see a real estate agent is that if we buy a house together, I want it to be something we can both afford (mortgage, down payment, taxes divided equally). I would put any money I make off the sale into my retirement account. That\u2019s the main reason why I haven\u2019t sold my land despite many developers begging me to (yes, some actually begged). I view it as my retirement investment.",

I don't use birth control due to my condition but I did insist on a condom. Lo and behold I'm pregnant my gynecologist confirmed it.  Now, I'm in a good position financially. I have a stable job and enough savings to live a very comfortable life. I'm close to my parents and sister. So, I have decided that I will keep the baby. I have always wanted to be a mum and this might be my only chance.  I contacted the father and told him. I said I'd be happy to co parent should he be interested but I understand if he isn't. I would be filing for child support regardless though.  The guy absolutely lost it and said I need to abort the baby and that I lied to him. Apparently he asked me what my opinion on abortion is to prevent this situation. I remember him asking me but he never specified his question and I thought it was more general. I told him I'm pro choice which is true. He must have interpreted this as me saying I'd abort any possible pregnancies.  Ever since he has been harassing me to abort. He must have given my number to his parents because today I got a call from his mother imploring me to have an abortion.  I have made up my mind and I won't have an abortion. My family is extremely supportive of my decision but I'm not sure if I'm in the right anymore. Edit since it keeps coming up. I did not tell him that I'm infertile and it was me who insisted on the condom. He was quite happy to hit it raw as he said.",

        "selftext": "I (35M) have been married to my wife (32F) for five years, and we\u2019ve been struggling financially for the past few months. I lost my job about three months ago, and while I\u2019ve found part-time work, it doesn\u2019t pay nearly as much as before. We\u2019ve had to cut back on a lot of things, but it feels like no matter what we do, we\u2019re still living paycheck to paycheck and even pulling from savings. Recently, my mom (65F) came over to visit, and she noticed how stressed I was about the money situation. She offered some advice on how we could save money\u2014things like cutting down on takeout, meal prepping to avoid buying groceries multiple times a week, and switching to cheaper brands. My mom has always been frugal, especially when she was raising me and my siblings on a tight budget. I thought it made sense, especially since we\u2019re really trying to save wherever we can. I asked if she was willing to go through our spending and show where we could cut down. My wife agreed with this. She made a whole spreadsheet about our spending, and we are spending wayyyyy to much on fun stuff. We don\u2019t need Starbucks everyday and so on. It also became apparent that most of the fun spending was my wifes Tbh my wife didn\u2019t take the breakdown well and started arguing with my mom that her spreadsheet was wrong. She said that my mom\u2019s way of doing things is \u201coutdated\u201d and doesn\u2019t work for us. She doesn\u2019t want to give up buying organic produce, and she likes having variety in what we eat each week. I tried to explain that we need to make some sacrifices if we want to get out of this financial hole, but she kept insisting that things weren\u2019t as bad as I was making them out to be and that we just needed to \u201cride it out.\u201d My mom left at this point and we were still arguing, and she told me she can\u2019t give up her takeout . She also went on about my mom being wrong. That\u2019s when I lost my patience and said, \u201cYou\u2019re f***ing wrong. My mom is right. She managed to raise three kids on one income, and we can\u2019t even cut back on groceries for a few months? .\u201d My wife got really upset, saying I am being a huge jerk for winding with my mom and that my mom is outdated. She\u2019s barely spoken to me since, and now I\u2019m wondering if I went too far. But the way I see it, we need to be realistic about our situation, and my mom\u2019s advice could actually help us get back on track.",

Changing my name wasn\u2019t a priority\u2014updating IDs, legal documents, and bank accounts would be a huge hassle. I still use his last name on official documents but go by my maiden name socially. Recently, he got engaged to a wonderful guy. I\u2019ve been supportive of their relationship, but during my grandson\u2019s birthday party, my ex suddenly asked if I\u2019d consider dropping his last name. His fianc\u00e9 chimed in, saying it makes him uncomfortable that I still use it. I was caught off guard and awkwardly joked that unless they want to spend hours in lines at various government offices, I wasn\u2019t going to change it. My ex didn\u2019t laugh. He insisted it\u2019s about starting a new chapter and wants me to \u201cmove on.\u201d The whole situation felt bizarre. For two years, it\u2019s never been an issue, and now they\u2019re ganging up on me? After the party, my ex called and argued that keeping his name makes it hard for his fianc\u00e9 to feel like they\u2019re starting a fresh life.

My ex admitted his fianc\u00e9 is uncomfortable because he sees me keeping the name as a \u201cpower play.\u201d I feel like I\u2019m caught between trying to keep peace and being forced into something just because his fianc\u00e9 is insecure. They want me to go through the hassle of changing everything for their comfort. I told my ex that I\u2019ll consider it later\u2014maybe after they\u2019re married and settled. But now, he\u2019s furious, saying I\u2019m being petty and selfish.

I\u2019m frustrated. I don\u2019t see why a name on some legal documents is such a big deal, but they\u2019re making me feel like the villain.

        "selftext": "I (22FtM) was staying at a friend's place a few months ago over my spring break. Let's call her Natalie (23F). Natalie and I have been friends for a while, but we haven't been able to hang out as much since she graduated last year and has been working. This was my first time seeing her new place, and our first time spending the night together (before anyone gets the wrong idea, there are absolutely no romantic or sexual feelings between us). Now, as a guy without a penis I am unable to enjoy the wonders of pissing standing up most of the time. STPs scare me and so I simply sit. However, when I shower I can pee however I'd like and it just goes down the drain and washes off my leg if I aim badly! I shower every night before bed and I basically always pee, it's just really satisfying for me. I don't really talk to my friends about my peeing habits, but my whole family pees in the shower as well and I just assumed it was normal. Last week, me and Natalie were hanging out with some of our friends. Somehow, we started talking about peeing, and so of course peeing in the shower came up. Many of my penisless friends agreed with me that it's so nice to be able to stand for once, and many of my penis-having friends even agreed as well. However, not everyone felt that way, and there was a bit of an awkward silence afterwards. Natalie approached me later and nervously asked me if I had peed in her shower, and I said yes. She got really quiet and the whole thing got really awkward. She kinda shuffled away and we sort of avoided each other the rest of the evening. Later, one of our mutual friends texted me to tell me Natalie was really uncomfortable to learn that I peed in her shower, and she was reconsidering whether she would ever let me stay with her again. I texted her about it directly and apologized, but she hasn't replied yet. So AITA for peeing in her shower? edit: who reported me to reddit as being in crisis im just trying to pee here \ud83d\ude2d",

        "selftext": "MMy brother and his wife have been trying to get pregnant but unfortunately she's had 6 miscarriages. That sucks, I know, I'm not discounting that at all. That being said she's a center of attention kind of person, she will shit talk other people all day long and try to make herself look like the best person in the room. If anyone else gets attention she tries to take it away from them, usually by putting them down verbally, or by getting another dog or cat. Most of the animals she has were obtained right after other people she knew got pregnant.  Well, wife and I got pregnant, discussed at length with how we should approach this, keeping my SIL in mind was the main topic of conversation. We didn't want to upset her but we also didn't feel like it was right to let her dictate our actions and make it impossible to celebrate the life that we're creating. So we made t shirts, announcing the pregnancy. Not gloating it, just announcing it.  Christmas time, we come over to my mom's place, do present exchange, then change shirts. My mother was very happy but I could see the look on my SIL face, upset. She didn't say anything and just shut herself in the bathroom, then left early later on in the day.  Next day she sends this message to my wife.  To say I\u2019m disappointed, is an understatement. We have had conversations about how hard infertility is during the holidays, and how hard/debilitating it is. (bro) and I have lost 6 babies. Six. We have six dead children, (wife). Springing you\u2019re pregnant on (bro) and I like that was uncalled for and completely ruined not only mine, but (bro) Christmas. You could\u2019ve sent me a heads up text about this, so we had time to process this. And if your excuse is \u201coh I didnt want it to ruin the surprise for mom\u201d, you\u2019re wrong. It\u2019s a completely invalid fear. Because I would never ruin a surprise like that. Not only that, but you also saw how that affected me, and you wouldn\u2019t stop talking about it. You\u2019re excited, sure. But read the room (wife). I cant tell you how much that damaged our relationship, and honestly. I dont know how many holidays I\u2019m going to be there for now because of what you did. What you did was completely selfish and careless. It showed me you really don\u2019t care about me. And honestly, had we gotten a heads up text, I\u2019d be happy for you. But right now? I\u2019m not. You both ruined Christmas for us. Idk why you thought that was such a good idea. You also had AN ENTIRE HOUR to do it before we got there. I had to leave early because I couldnt stand being there for another minute in a house that I didnt feel loved in.  The only time we talked about it was when my family was asking questions, due date, gender, etc., it's not like we were talking about it throughout the day.  Am I the asshole (are we the assholes) for having decided to do the pregnancy announcement anyways?",

        "selftext": "My (27F) older brother and SIL (both mid 30's) just welcomed their first child a year and a half ago, after YEARS of trying. After many failed attempts, SIL was told that she wouldn't be able to conceive due to a medical condition she has, they finally got pregnant.  Since having my niece, the baby has been the center of attention at EVERY family even we've had since she was born. Birthday's, wedding's, family get togethers, you name it. Now don't get me wrong I LOVE my niece, but it can get to be a little too much when my SIL goes on and on about how long they tried to conceive, complications they've had, miscarriages they've had etc. Like a little TOO much info. Many family members have commented on how it's a little bit excessive, but no one has said anything because they don't want to sound like an AH.  Anyway I'm getting married in the spring and my brother and SIL approached me last weekend about having my niece be the flower girl. Now my fianc\u00e9 (35M) has two children (10M and 6F) from his previous marriage. His son is one of his groomsmen while his daughter had asked to be our flower girl when we told them the news that we were getting married a year ago, as it's something she always wanted to do, so of course we said yes.  So I explained this to my SIL when she asked me about my niece. She asked if my step daughter can just carry my niece with her? I said I don't think she'd be comfortable with that considering she's 6. She then asked why I can't give that role to my niece, and allow herself to carry my niece down as the flower girl? I said no because I already promised my step  daughter. She then starting going off about how my lack of effort to incorporate my niece is disgusting to her. I should honor her in some way since I know how long and hard they tried for my niece.  Now I may sound like an AH for this but I kind of got fed up and snapped and said  Incorporate my niece how? By the time the wedding comes around she'll be 2 years old. The ENTIRE family already knows your story about how long and hard you guys tried for her. What more do you expect me to do to honor her? She started crying and said that clearly I don't love my one and only niece and I'm letting her down. I said of course I love my niece, and obviously she's going to be involved in pictures and stuff. But I'm not going to let my step daughter down by giving my niece a role she's too young to remember anyway.  Well now SIL and my brother are pissed off with me for not letting my niece be flower girl, and are running around telling the rest of the family I don't love my niece. My mom had been trying to stay neutral but thinks my step daughter would understand if I explained to her I need to give that role to my niece. I'm firm in my decision though, and my fianc\u00e9 is thankful that I didn't let his daughter down. AITA for not allowing my niece to be the flower girl?",

        "selftext": "So my friend 20f and I 19m have been friends for a few years and she recently got engaged. A week ago I got a dm from her for a small costume party she was hosting as a celebration for her getting engaged. I asked if there was a theme and she said there wasn\u2019t. I\u2019m a cosplayer so I had a lot of choices. I didn\u2019t want to rock up in an anime cosplay, so I thought it would be funny to go to an engagement party as the Corpse Bride. I arrived at her house yesterday and everything seemed normal. A few people complemented my costume and I was having a lot of fun. After ten minutes my friend\u2019s fianc\u00e9 walked out in a black tuxedo and announced this was actually their wedding. Apparently my friend saw a video of someone doing this and wanted to do the same. He asked us all to go to the back yard for the ceremony to begin. I went straight to him. I asked him if I should quickly go home and change my outfit and that I would get back before it started. He told me it was fine since I didn\u2019t know this was the wedding. I trusted him and followed everyone outside. They got married and everything seemed good. The reception was just in their house again so everyone just walked back inside and picked up where they left off. I tried talking to my friend and celebrating with her but she kept making excuses to not talk to me. I assumed it was just because she was tried from the big day and wanted some alone time. I didn\u2019t bother her after that and the party soon ended. I got home and half an hour passed when my phone started getting notifications. I checked and it was my friend texting me. She was cussing me out and telling me how I ruined her wedding. I was really confused and asked what I did. That only made her more angry. She told me it was basic knowledge not to wear a wedding dress to a wedding. I reminded her I had no idea it was a wedding and that I asked her now husband if I should change and he said it was fine. She didn\u2019t respond, but I got a text from her husband. He asked why I would tell her he said it was fine. I told him he said it was fine. Then he said how I should have changed anyways and it\u2019s my fault that the two are now fighting over this. I\u2019ve tried texting her that I wad sorry and if I had known I wouldn\u2019t have done it. I woke up today and saw her and her husband have blocked me on everything. So, AITA for not changing out of the wedding dress when I found out it was actually a wedding? Edit: I am a guy. I cosplayed the character Emily from The Corpse Bride and had blue paint all over. I\u2019m also Australian and I\u2019ve never heard a costume party meaning fancy.

        "selftext": "When my daughter was 14, wife and I decided we would buy a car for her to use on her 16th if she proved herself to be responsible, got good grades, etc. There would be a contract of sorts to ensure we were all on the same page. The stipulations were continuing good grades, good attitude, she could only bring one friend with her somewhere (to begin with), we had to know where she was, and the obvious two: don't drink & drive, and don't text and drive.  We made it clear that **we** were buying the car, but it was for her to use. We got the car, a 2012 Honda Civic. She has a summer job right now, it's summer break so she's out doing stuff with her friends, etc. In a few months she will be off to college. Everything was going swimmingly. Until someone on that NextDoor app started posting pictures and videos of bad drivers in the area. And lo and behold, my daughter was posted with her face down as she texted and rolled through a stop sign. Once with her face down in her phone at a stoplight. I was livid. My wife was the one who showed it to me. We found out there were more instances (from her Instagram Stories) and we decided... no. Wife and I up and sold the car. We didn't lose very much in the process, except of course our daughter completely came unraveled. It's so unfair, I didn't hurt anyone, everyone's doing it, how am I supposed to get to work, what about when I go to college? Well, we said no, it's not unfair, you hurt us by being a shitty, irresponsible driver, no, not everyone's doing it, you can walk, ride your bike, or take the bus, and as for college, you don't need the car to get to and from classes, and again, ride your bike or walk. She tried to play the how can you send your daughter to college without her safety in mind? card and I said Well, well, well, now you're concerned about safety? and she just up and screamed.  This has everyone in our life up in arms and divided. Her grandparents think we're being over the top and awful, that grounding her would have sufficed. They've threatened that THEY will buy her a car again if we try to send her to college without one.  The car is already sold, so there's no going back. I think what we did was absolutely correct, that actions have consequences and we would be in the wrong to pull back from that. In terms of her going to college? Well, she made that choice. She had a car, it came with certain stipulations, she disobeyed us, and now she pays the price.  So AITA?",

        "selftext": "My son Aiden (23) moved back in with us upon graduating college as my husband wanted. My husband's original plan was to have Aiden live with us for free, but stay home and help with his disabled younger brother (16). Aident started complaining about needing money and wanted to find a job. My husband was against this and even offered to double his allowance but Aiden was growing tired of staying at home. So he began looking for jobs here and there for over a year but non of his job applications came through. He'd just apply and they never get back to him. We were confused by this til recently, I found out that my husband was behind all the job applications being cancelled. He'd wait tol Aiden applies then he proceeds to cancel the application by impersonating him and using his email. I blew up at him for this but his justification is that he's just trying to make sure that our younger son is cared for by Aiden and said that Aiden has been big help and him getting a job will affect his care for his brother. I went ahead and rented an apartment for Aiden and told him to stay there til he finds a job and starts paying for it himself. Aiden was hurt upon knowing what his dad did. My husband was livid when he found out. He called me unhinged and said that I was separating the boys and teaching Aiden to become selfish and care more about a job than family. He also said it was huge decision for me to rent an apartment without even running it with him. He's been giving me hell about it and is calling me a terrible mother for encouraging Aiden to be selfish and selfcentered. He said I needed to see and understand why he did what he did. [Edit] few things to mention: (1) My husband says that since he and I have health issues then we could use Aiden's help. (2) When I suggested outside help, my husband refused saying he won't ask anything from anybody and that his son is his problem and no body else's. (3) I used money from our joint account to pay for the rental apartment. My husband said it was wrong and that it was a major waste of money since we deal with medical bills consistenly.",

My brother 'Chris' (M) and his wife (F) have a 3 yro son who everyone calls miracle or rainbow baby. He came after several failed pregnancies that lasted for years.  When they found out that my nephew was included in the no children rule; they tried to convince me to make an exception for him. Chris told me his son is a miracle baby and his presence at the wedding will bring blessings for me and my fiancee. I refused and said no, the wedding is childfree. His wife kept sending my fiancee pics of my nephew when he was months old (what that mean??). I told them no, and to stop. My brother told me this might cause a rift in our relationship, I again said no and explained that the wedding is childfree. He asked again and pointed out how his baby is different since he's a rainbow, a miracle baby. I again said no and explained that the wedding is childfree. They brought it up when they visited at my home and I knew they weren't going to stop so I'd made flash cards in advance with the phrase the wedding is childfree, period and pulled them out and started slowly showing them the flash cards one by one in this order:  - The wedding (with a sticker of bride and groom).  - Is Child (with a sticker of a baby).  - FREEE (with a sticker of a \ud83d\udeab sign).  - PERIOD (with a huge, black dot sticker).  They both were stunned. I asked if they get it now and Chris had lost his shit. His wife had already grabbed her stuff and walked out. Chris called me an asshole for doing this and said that I disrespected him, his wife and their son who's my one and only nephew. He rushed out after we argued. My fiancee saw the whole thing and thought that it was funny but my parents and Chris are livid beyond measure. They're telling everyone about the amount of disrespect and mockery I had displayed towards them and I'm being told to fix it now.",

        "selftext": "Backstory: I (43f) have 4 kids. El (22f) Katie (17f) cam(15m) isla (5f) and I'm also currently pregnant. Me and my husband (50m) started adding to college funds every month for each of our kids pretty much as soon as we found out we were pregnant. I won't say the exact amount but my husband has an excellent job so it's more than most. We never told our kids because it just didn't feel necessary. El got pregnant when she was 16 and ended up dropping out of school. I was very disappointed but I understood. However I was under the impression she would return later, but she has no plans to. The dad stuck around and now they have 1 more kid (3) and one on the way. They are engaged but don't plan to marry until they can afford it. They were doing okay financially for a while but due to the market right now they've been struggling because El can't get a job since she doesn't have a diploma so we've been loaning them money. Katie is a senior and  just got accepted into college, we've been setting everything up and obviously she knows about the fund now. Katie and El were talking and she was telling El about the school and El asked how she was planning on paying for it, Katie responded my college fund I was in the room while they were talking and this made me panic. We had just planned on splitting it between the remaining four since we knew they were going to college. El asked me if they all had one and I wasn't going to lie, so I said yes. She got really excited and went to call her fiance and tell him the good news. I was confused and told her she couldn't have the money, she asked why and I said it's for school. She got upset and left my house.  The next day I get a call from El, she was crying and begging me to let her have the funds so she could finally afford a down payment and maybe even a wedding. I told her she could have the money if she went back to school and whatever money was keft over she could use for whatever she wanted. She got super mad and started yelling at me and saying it's her money. I told her that it was MY money and those  were my conditions and she hung up. Now we are being harassed by her fiances family (they aren't as fortunate as us) calling us assholes and a lot of other names. Saying it's all gonna go to waste if she doesn't use it, were setting her up for failure, etc.. Now I'm wondering if I'm the asshole because my dad said we should give her the money as we saved it for her after all. So am I the asshole? UPDATE: ( I think this is within the rules, please correct me if it's not)My daughter came over on Thursday and we were able to work things out. We both apologized and had a long discussion. She will be getting her GED and will be going to a trade school in exchange for me giving her whatever money is left over. She hasn't decided which one yet, but it will probably be cosmetology. Her fiances family has apologized. We also decided to pay for small wedding ceremony and reception as a gift.",

We've also been busy moving into our new home that we purchased together (30% of his savings + 70% of mine). I have to say that saving up for this house took most of my savings and prevented me from enjoying the things I love spending money on. My fianc\u00e8 sat me down yesterday to talk about his 'groom speech'. he talked about few points but what made me upset was when he asked if I would be okay if he mentions the house we bought and say that HE was the one who bought it. I was a bit taken aback, I asked why and he said it's just a confidence boost during the speech and that's it. I said I didn't feel comfortable with the idea because I think that it's unfair not to acknowledge the fact that I'd sacrificed so much to be able to buy the house. I reminded him of how much I contributed but he said this doesn't change that it's our house so it shouldn't matter to me if he said he bought it himself or we both did. I refused because then people will always think the house was bought by him which is something that will never change no matter how hard I try to prove that I contributed 70%. He got made at me and said that I was really overthinking this whole thing and making a big deal out of it. We got into an argument and he started yelling saying it's just one favor he's asking me to do and yet, I'm making this ridiculous, small request my hill to die on. He's basically sulking and now he's out and refusing to answer my calls so basically he's started the silent treatment til I cave in. AITA for making this my hill to die on? [EDIT] My fiance comes from more humble background and money has always been a struggle for him and his family. It's become obvious how insecure he can be when it comes to money, especially when he compares how much I make VS how he makes. I've never made him feel as less than and he has never took advantage of me in any way and so his recent request really cut me off guard to say the least.",

I found a 2nd job recently and he's been having me pay every time we go out. When I protest he'd say he's going through a rough patch and is seeing how much help I cam offer.

He asked me if I brought enough momey, I said why and he told me that he told his parents that I'd pay for their meals. I said why would I and he went on about his parents going through a rough patch just like him. I said I'm sorry this can't be a coincidence! he asked what I meant and I told him that I would not be paying. He insisted, I refused and said no. He then leaned back and said well, you're here, so not much of a choice you have anyway while laughing like it was funny. I silently got up, took my phone and purse and walked right out. He was shocked he started shouting after me to stop and wait but I didn't. I went home and he called me enraged saying that I did a horrible thing walking out on him and his parents, while I could've just paid. I told him that their unfortunate financial situation isn't my problem and that I wasn't obligated to pay for their food. If they couldn't pay for their meals, then they should not go out. He got offended and said and I qoute you're making money a priority just like my ex did then went on about how disrespectful my attitude was and how I made him look small infront of his parents and forced him to lie about why I wasn't there when they came. We've been going back an forth about it til now. He's mad and is refusing to speak to me til I apologize. AITA? I feel bad because his parents are lovely and I been doing my best to keep a good relationship with them.",

        "selftext": "My (39F) daughter (16F) has had a sensitive stomach ever since she was a kid. There are certain foods that will upset her stomach to the point where she's unable to stop throwing up. We've seen countless doctors, but so far nobody's been able to give us a clear answer. The only advice we keep getting is to identify all trigger foods and cut them from her diet. We have a pretty good idea of what those foods are: soda and other carbonated drinks, chips, cheetos, and other similar processed snacks, anything oily or fried and most sweets. Unfortunately, this is exacty the kind of stuff my daughter loves to eat the most. And as horrible as she feels after she has them, she still refuses to cut them out of her diet, which in turn led to her spending a lot of time in the hospital during the past few years. When she was little, it was easier to keep all these foods away from her because I simply wouldn't buy them. But now that she's older, I can't always be there to check what she eats. She eats the greasy pizza at her school's cafeteria, she trades her lunch with her classmates, she goes out with her friends and stops to eat at KFC and so on. And it always ends with her in the ER, crying and shaking because she can't stop throwing up. This was the case on this Christmas eve as well, when our whole family gathered at our place. And of course, among the many dishes at our Christmas table were some of her main trigger foods, like chips, soda, chocolate and sweets. Now mind you, these were far from the only foods available to her. We also had a variety of home-cooked, traditional dishes on the table, with ingredients that don't upset her stomach, like vegetables, meat, dairy etc. All of them delicious and well-seasoned - my daughter herself says she really likes most of these dishes.\u00a0 Despite this, my daughter chose to eat nothing but her trigger foods. I reminded her that they'd make her feel awful, but she said she didn't care, because *Christmas is only once a year* and she *just wants to live a little*. Well, this ended with her violently throwing up in the ER a few hours later. She had to be hospitalized for a few days and only just got out of the hospital a few hours ago. And unlike all the previous times when something like this happened, this time I chose to spend my Christmas relaxing at home with the rest of our family, and not in the hospital by my daughter's side. I kept in touch with her through calls and texts, and told her that if she needed anything I'd ask a family member to bring it to her, but I made it clear that I would not be visiting her during her stay. And well, my daughter didn't take this too well. She cried every time we talked on the phone, begged me to come over, told me how horrible I was for 'abandoning' her there all alone and so on. Most of our family didn't take my side in this either, and during the past few days I got called everything from 'a little extreme' to downright cruel and heartless. AITA, Reddit?",

        "selftext": "So, my husband (38M) and I (36F) are expecting our first child, a bouncing baby girl due in a few months. We were both over the moon when we found out the gender, but now things have gotten . . . complicated, to say the least. See, when we first started talking about names, the \u201cboy name\u201d was immediately decided: Stuart Jr., after my husband. No problem there, it\u2019s a classic name and carries family meaning. But, for a girl, things got murky. My husband suggested Stuarta. No, you\u2019re not having a stroke. Apparently, his logic is that since Stuart ends in \u201ct,\u201d we can just add an \u201ca\u201d to make it feminine. I tried explaining why that doesn\u2019t quite work, how it sounds more like a furniture brand than a human name, how she\u2019d be endlessly correcting people and explaining its origin. He\u2019s adamant though, says it \u201chonors\u201d him while giving our daughter a unique name. I\u2019ve suggested alternatives: feminine names that maybe share a similar sound or meaning to Stuart, names he\u2019s mentioned liking in the past, even just going back to the drawing board entirely. But he\u2019s fixated on Stuarta. Now, I love my husband dearly, and I understand wanting to honor family. But I can\u2019t imagine subjecting our daughter to a lifetime of awkward stares and endless questions about her \u201cunusual\u201d name. I also worry about potential bullying and the impact it could have on her self-esteem. So, Reddit, am I the jerk for refusing to budge on Stuarta? Is there any compromise I haven\u2019t considered? Help a soon-to-be mama out! TL;DR: Husband wants to name our daughter after himself; in a really, really bad way. I think it\u2019s terrible and will set her up for a lifetime of awkwardness. AITA? Looking forward to your thoughts and (hopefully) some sanity checks! Edit: Please, no suggestions for other \u201c-ta\u201d names. The man clearly has a theme, and I need to gently steer him away from it, not fuel the fire!",

Dad left money (inheritance) for me and sister and she used her inhertance to get new cars and renovate her houseI live with my aunt right now cause my brother inlaw didn't let me stay with my sister. I'm planning on using my inhertance money to pay for college tuition (I've always wanted to be doctor but haven't decided which branch yet). My sister & I haven't been close, it started after she got married to her chronically ill husband who was allowed to make backhanded comments about dad and mock his llness and make a scene at his funeral.only because he's ill and shouldn't be held accountable for his behavior.I've distanced myself But my sister kept visiting alot lately venting about my brother inlaws condition. He's been in & out the hospital for heart problems and in need for a surgery. She brought up my inheritance money several times but I end up cutting the conversation. She then straight up asked if I could help pay for her husband's surgery and she'd pay back in less than a year. I felt uneasy cause if I give her money from my inhertance which is a large amount then there's no gurantee she'll pay back before It's time to apply for college. I'm taking a year gap but I know my sister can't pay back that much and I felt I was risking my future. I refused to help and she had a melt down at my aunt's house calling me heartless, cruel with no empathy. She said that her husband's health should be a priority and I needed to help because education is nothing compared to someone's health and asked if I'd be happy to see her as a widow and my nephew with no father.My aunt suggested others pay but most of them cut my sister and her husband off. I argued that her husband's poor health isn't my fault after she kept blaming and guiltriping me. She kept crying and although my aunt decided to stay out of it she said that I should be prepared for permenant damage in my relationship with my sister if I don't help her now.  She's been sending texts and pictures of her family telling me this is what I was saying no to, a happy healthy family with a healthy husband and father. I cried and felt like I was being selfish not good aunt and sister. I asked my friend and he said let them sell the cars and all the luxurious stuff they bought to afford the surgery and warned me if I give them money I'll never get it back and may not be able to go to medical school.",

Context: I have a large family, I have 2 stepsisters (18, 20) and a biological brother (27) and also a biological sister (30). My fiance argued that the guest list should be cut short and suggested I only invite my immeditate family, I asked him to elaborate and he suggested excluding my stepsisters. I said no and got upset with him for implying that they're not family, he said well, This wasn't what I meant..I was just speaking from a technical angle, especially since I didn't include them in the wedding party like MOH and bridesmaids. So he thought they wereunneeded but I said they are wanted, and will always be wanted and included by me. Well, days ago, my stepsisters called saying my fianc\u00e9 cancelled their invitations and told them some lie about changing wedding location and telling them they won't be able to come. I was fuming, I went home and started screaming at him, He asked that I hear him out then explained he had no choice since we were required to shorten the list, and he just did my dirty work for me since I obviously was looking at the situation from an emotional angle and couldn't bring myself to disinvite my stepsisters myself. I called him a hypocrite cause he invited almost 6 of his friends who, as far as I know, aren't immediate family. I told him he hurt my stepsisters by going behind my back and excluding them from  y wedding which they've been so excited about. He got up from the couch and yelled that it's our wedding so my stepsisters feelings aren't really that relevant compared to H.I.S and called me controlling for wanting my way or the highway. He took his phone amd stormed out to see his friends. Some of his friends called to scold me for how I'm treating their brotherand then went on about how rude I was to suggestthat their brother disinvite them from the wedding just because I don't like them and called it a you problem. My fmil called and is wanting to sleak to me, he probably told her what's going on and she is probably going to ask that I apologize for yelling.",

        "selftext": "My wife and I are both 32. Since we got married and moved in together five months ago, my wife has simply not made nearly enough food for me. This is not a kind of situation where I'm constantly agitated at her for incompetence or anything like that. I would be more than happy to microwave a burrito. I would be more than happy to whip up a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.  But I can't. My wife has, every single night of our marriage, done the same thing: she'll make me a tiny dinner. I'm talking like a Chinese chicken salad with 30 grams of chicken and ten leaves of lettuce arranged fashionably with dressing. When I finish eating, I'm still hungry because for a 230 pound man who works a physical labor job, it's not enough food.  At first, I tried to openly communicate with her, but she always took it horribly. She would adopt a thousand-yard stare, and then begin talking about how incompetent she is and how she can't even make her husband a proper dinner. I'd try to calm her down with Oh honey that's not the case! I just eat too much or Don't worry about it. I can make a bit more. I'd try to be overwhelmingly positive. It never helped. She would always just get incredibly disappointed in herself, cry, and/or take it out on me. Then she would make the same exact amount the following day. After the communication route failed, I tried to eat her dinners as-is. It became hard to sleep at night due to hunger and I lost seven pounds in the first month. Eventually I figured out my own system. On my way home from work, I started swinging by a fast food restaurant and getting myself a burger. I would basically pregame her meals with some more calories. I figured it was win-win, as what she doesn't know can't hurt her, and I could have my fill of food. I would eat on my way home, walk in the door, pick at the salad or quinoa or homemade Mac and Cheese she made, compliment her for her delicious cooking, and later dispose of the wrappers discretely.  Two days ago I was on my way home and in line at a drive-through. My MIL was coming out of the restaurant. She ran over and greeted me. I asked her in a humorous way not to tell her daughter where she saw me because she'd take it badly, and she agreed, but then she narced on me anyway. I got home to a furious wife who demanded details. When I provided the truth she got extremely angry and looked legitimately hurt. I'm not good at handling confrontation and feel like I betrayed my wife in some way. Was I wrong here?",

        "selftext": "This will be my first year in college. When I got accepted, the 1st person I told was my uncle. We\u2019re very close because he took care of me when I was little because of my parent\u2019s crazy work schedules. Anyway, my grades were good enough to get me in but not enough to get me any scholarships. That means I\u2019ll have to take out loans for tuition and work for my expenses. When my uncle found out, he said I should just concentrate on school instead of working but my dad (his brother) said that money is tight right now so my parents can\u2019t help me out as much as they want to. My uncle has investment properties all over the place so he said it\u2019s not a big deal for him to buy another one near my campus, which he did. Then he had contractors renovate the house so emerging in there is brand new. He even had them install a bay window in the master bedroom just for me and I got to pick out everything else like the carpet and counters. He told me he wants me to concentrate on school and not work. Instead, I can be his landlady and rent out the other 3 bedrooms and keep that money to fund my expenses. I have a group of friends who are attending the same school so I made a deal with them. Studio apartments are going between $900-1500 (not including utilities) around the campus with the expensive ones being closer. My uncle\u2019s house is one street over from campus so I can literally walk to class everyday. I\u2019m charging my friends $700 per room or if they double up, $350 per person per month and split utilities evenly. They all jumped at the offer and no one asked any questions until recently when one of them asked me how much the overall rent was. I was honest and told them about my uncle and our deal. That blew up in my face because now everyone of my friends are calling me greedy for charging them rent then pocketing the money. We\u2019re all in a huge fight and they all want to either pay nothing or \u201cthrow a couple hundred\u201d in for utilities.  I cried to my uncle but he said now that I\u2019m an adult, I need to make my own adult decision. He\u2019ll stand by my decision. I don\u2019t want to lose my friends but I don\u2019t want to disappoint my family with bad grades either. I thought I was being fair with rent but literally all of my friends are calling me a greedy AH. Update: Thank you for reading my post and giving me advice. I went to my uncle, this time without crying, and told him some of the advice given on here and asked him for his advice. This time he didn\u2019t tell me to make my own adult decisions and told me he was waiting for this conversation. This is what we agreed to do. I texted all of my friends (former?) and told them because of the arguments and hurt feelings, we can no longer live together. My uncle offered to work out a lease for me in the beginning but I refused because these were my friends. Because no one signed a lease, we didn\u2019t have to break any. I was worried about them suing but my uncle said that the law in our state requires anything to do with real estate be in writing. Unlike other situations, real estate deals cannot be oral so I\u2019m good. This time I took him up on the offer of creating a lease for me to have new tenants sign. We spent the morning researching rent prices and making ads. My friends and I made the agreement at the beginning of summer. Now that there\u2019s only a couple of weeks left until school starts, we found almost nothing within 3 miles of campus. There were some options further out but nothing was cheaper than $1,200 for a shared room and that was in an old house with window A/C units and 5 miles from campus. When the house was being renovated, my uncle had central air and heating installed. We came to a rent price of $1,300 and placed ads in several places including FB. Within an hour, I got a dozen messages. It\u2019s 4 pm now and I literally have over 100 messages. Many of them don\u2019t even need to see the house in person. Based off of the pictures and location, they want to submit their application today. Some even offered to send me the deposit and 1 person said her dad will pay me the full semester amount today. My uncle gave me some advice that was exactly what you guys said. Never mix money with friends or I might lose both and never tell anybody my business. He told me not to lie, just keep quiet. Thanks again and have a great weekend you wonderful people!",

She then tried to get on my good side and started overly praising everything I do and sometimes even copying me like that one time when she LITERALLY dyied her hair purple just like mine and when everyone pointed out how ridiculous she looked, she actually blamed me and accused me of trying to make a joke out of her.  So, Anyways! My husband and I took 2 weeks off work to go visit some places out of the country - tourism in other words. Thing is I was the one who saved up for and arranged for the trip (my husband was responsible for booking the tickets). My husband's mom wanted to come along and threw temper tantrums when I said no. She called, texted, sent people to talk to me into letting her come, even threatened to call the police and make some complaint up to get us to stay if she can't come. My husband said we should just take her but I told him he was wrong to tell her about the trip in the first place. He gave me an ultimatim. said he wouldn't go if she can't come and I told him I'd gladly call his bluff which made him take his words back and say FINE! I will tell her to stop it because we won't take her. Things got quieter, suspeciously quieter. the day of the trip came and we got to the airport at 2pm. My husband was walking ahead of me and was looking left and right like he was looking for someone. I asked him but he didn't respond. He lead me to the waiting area and first thing I saw was his mom standing there with her luggage . I froze in my spot, I felt a cold wave washing over me and I was fuming inside. She and my husband were hugging that's when I quietly turned around and started walking towards the exit. My husband followed me while shouting at me to stop. he tried to stop me but I told him off the harshest way possible. He tried to say I was overreacting and that his mom was there anyway and I should let it go and not mess the trip up for us. I told him he and his mom could still go and that I was going home. I went home and sobbed into my dog's fur for several minutes. turned out he booked her a ticket without me knowing. an hour later he came home yelling and raging about how pathetic and spiteful I was to walk out and go home and ruin the trip last minute. I told him he caused this to happen. he said that I was being so hard on his mom it's ridiculous. I refused to fight any more but he kept on berating me then called my family to tell them that the trip was cancelled and that it was because of me. My family said that I shouldn't have ruined it for myself and should've sucked it up and done my best to enjoy. Did I really overreact?",

        "selftext": "My boyfriend had to go to the ER after a accident, and he got a truly ridiculous bill back. I offered to fight the bill for her because I've done it before, and he said sure.  I went all-out, because honestly if we were out 5 grand, after insurance, that would fuck up our holiday plans pretty bad.  So I... - had him call the hospital and authorize me to handle his bill and access his medical records.  - got an itemized bill and compared the prices for each code to the fair prices - called billing to dispute the bill, but was told that billing only collects bills, I'd need to contact admin to dispute - bounced around a call center for hours trying to get someone who was actually qualified for bill disputes, and getting nowhere  - google and linkedin searched for the hospital board of directors and upper management  - got 30 emails of the most influential people at the hospital, plus the hospital's investors - every day would send a few emails, working my way up the chain, and writing an (increasingly long) email describing how they billed my client at 7 times over the fair price for services rendered, and how their billing department, customer service department, and the growing list of management I'd emailed, had failed to address the issue.  - escalated the emails until I was writing the director-level staff with the entire board of directors and a number of outside investors CC'd, asking for a written statement regarding their justification for billing at a rate 7 times higher than the national average, for commensurate services to what is available at other hospitals. And sternly laying out the failures to appropriately respond, at every level of the company.  Well, once I'd done all that (which was honestly only like 15 minutes a day) they reduced the bill... From $5000 to $26. Yep, twenty-six fuckin dollars.  Well, I told my boyfriend the good news, and he was at first overjoyed and blown away, like literally jumping up and down and hugging me and saying I was literally a Christmas miracle.  But then when he asked how I did it, I said it wasn't too hard, I just had to send a couple emails each day. He was curious what I'd said, and I handed him my phone.  He started to get stressed, and flipping back through other emails. Which there were like 60 of. He told me I went way too far, he was expecting me to dispute through their billing department or something normal and reasonable like that, not internet stalk every single manager and board member and investor and harass them into dropping the bill.  I was frustrated because I'd just saved us 5 grand, actually made it possible for us to afford a nice Christmas and save some money, and he was mad at me because I'd been a bit of a hardass?  I was furious, and he was also mad at me, saying he authorized me to dispute a bill, not basically threaten and harass a whole damn hospital for weeks.  AITA for how I got my boyfriend's medical bills dropped?",

        "selftext": " Hear me out, just read the whole text. So my wife, F (26) and I, M (33) been married for 2 years. I admit that she is a hothead and can be a bit much especially when shes mad at me. I take responsibility for any mistake j make like not cleaning the bathroom after the shower or filling her car with gas after using it. I even stand there and let her unload her anger and frustration on me BUT only at home and not in public. She tends to start arguing with me in public instead of waiting til we get home.  Recently she's been coming to my workplace to berate me over something I did the night before like not getting the stuff I said I would get or doing the stuff I said I would do. It's embarrassing and humiliating,iating and has been affecting my job to the point where I started getting a warning after a warning from my superiors who, I believe have been very patient and understanding especially when my wife makes a fuss at the office. Last week I was in the middle of a 2hr meeting and next thing I knew was seeing my wife barge in while yelling at me asking why I was keeping my phone turned off (I had to turn it off after getting warnings about I since she forbid me from turning it off). I was stunned, because my superior and co workers AND potential clients were there. I didn't even move my superior dealt with it and called security to get her out. My wide started arguing with him telling him she came for me then started urging me to get off my seat and tell them to back off. But I didn't I just watched as security escorted her out. It was horrible because I had a fear that my job was lost. She yelled at me repeatedly to get them to stop but she got kicked out eventually.  I got told she's no longer allowed there and that this was going to be my final, last warning. I apologized then went home. She was there waiting then yelled about me watching and doing nothing whole she was getting mistreated and kicked out. I finally snapped and said she was over the line, made a scene that risked my job over few missed calls. She started crying saying I still should've defended her after getting humiliated infront of my co workers but told her she didn't have to worry about it because she's no longer allowed there. She got more furious and went to her mom's to stay there.",

        "selftext": "I'm a 48-year-old man and my 19-year-old daughter has always been an independent thinker. I raised her to be independent and think for herself, which I've always appreciated. However, we recently hit a bit of a snag. She got engaged and decided that she doesn't want me to walk her down the aisle at her wedding. She argues that her mother and I don't own her, therefore we have no right to give her away. I feel hurt by this because we never treated her like an object or piece of property, rather we've tried our best to provide her with a wonderful life. Her stance seems extreme to me and despite discussions, she's refusing to budge on the issue. I respect her choices, but I feel she's disregarding our feelings completely. As a response, I told her that if she feels that way, then I won't be paying for her wedding. I don't want to come across as controlling or manipulative. It's true, I don't own her, I also don't owe her a fully-funded wedding. She can pay for her own wedding if she's insistent on this stance. I'm feeling quite conflicted about this. AITA? Edit: So, this isn't about making the wedding about me. Walking her down the aisle (while all eyes are on her anyway) and then sitting down is hardly making the wedding about me. It's about her attitude. She's had every opportunity in life so far, and to exclude us from this day is a spit in the face. It's a rejection of everything we've done for her, sacrificed for her, given her. It's selfish. 90% of wedding traditions and symbolism had roots in things we don't acknowledge today. Should we stop all of them? The rings, the flowers, the dress, the wedding party, the cake, the flower girls... a father walking his daughter down the aisle has been about respect, pride, love and honoring the father/daughter relationship for far longer than it was about ownership. Independent thinking does not mean rude or selfish thinking. Being an independent thinker does not give someone the license to disregard or disrespect the thoughts, feelings, or perspectives of others. Independent thinking is about maintaining the ability to think critically and form one's own opinions while remaining respectful and considerate of others. It is a balance between asserting individuality and engaging in meaningful and respectful interactions with others. Edit 2: Also note that our relationship is not so weak that this disagreement will ruin our relationship. We are still close with each other in spite of this. There is zero chance of her not inviting us to her wedding (regardless of who pays for it) or cutting off contact and withholding grandchildren. I feel sorry for anyone who suggests that as a possibility. Likewise, there is zero chance of us refusing to go to the wedding or cutting her out of the will. In life, people disagree - even strongly - it's a natural part of life. We don't end life-long relationships over it.   UPDATE: For all the YTA people out there, I've decided to give my daughter a gift in the same amount as her older sister's wedding cost. She can use this for whatever she wants. For the NTA people out there, thanks, most of you get it. My daughter has also agreed to figure out a way to include us in a way that doesn't involve giving her away. We are still in the early wedding planning stages, and she is almost 20. So she will likely be 21 before the actual marriage. Thanks for the concern, I guess. I approve of the groom-to-be if that matters to anyone. We disagree, but that doesn't mean it's a relationship-ending event. My daughter is laughing hilariously at all of you that are saying she will disinvite us from the wedding or cut us off from grandkids. I just feel sorry for you all. THAT is petty and manipulative, and regardless of what you all say, I've raised her better than that.",

        "selftext": "I (F23) have been dating my boyfriend \u201cJake\u201d (M23) since our freshmen year of college. In our last year of undergrad, we decided to rent an apartment together. We split everything 50/50, including utilities, groceries, and rent. We continued living together in the same town as our college after graduation, but recently, we both got jobs in Chicago and we are currently living downtown. My dad works in real estate, and he has multiple investment properties. My dad generously allowed me to live in one of his properties rent free, but he said that my boyfriend would have to pay him $400 a month for rent. My dad is very protective, but he has been nothing but kind to my boyfriend. My dads reasoning for making my boyfriend pay rent is that he wants to be sure that my boyfriend is with me for me, and not because he will have a free place to live. (Keep in mind, if my dad was renting this apartment out to tenants, he would charge $2100 a month for rent. Very ritzy building in the middle of downtown Chicago).  My boyfriend is mad at me because he asked me for my half of the $400 for rent, and I explained to him that I will not be paying rent. My dad is only charging him. He says that we have been splitting rent for the past 2 years so why would we stop now?  Our rent in our college town was $1200, so we were both paying $600 a month. Our apartment in Chicago is significantly nicer and he is paying $200 less a month than what he was in college.  Is the idea that my DAD doesn\u2019t charge me for rent, but charges my boyfriend so crazy? Should I suck it up and pay half because I can afford it? EDIT: Jake and I still split utilities and groceries 50/50, and when we go out on date nights, we switch off who pays for it. If he pays one week, i\u2019ll pay the next.",

        "selftext": "My husband (58 M) and I (56 F) recently met my son\u2019s (24 M) girlfriend for the first time. He\u2019s been crazy about her. Apparently they\u2019ve been dating for a year before he decided to have her meet us officially.  What he\u2019s told us about her all seems great: she just got her degree, was enjoying her job, family-oriented, etc., I\u2019m honestly just glad he\u2019s happy with her. My husband and I don\u2019t think he\u2019s ever been this into someone before, so I feel pretty bad about what I did.  Last weekend, he brought her over for dinner. By now we\u2019d been anticipating meeting her with how much our son has been gushing about her. How perfect she is, that she\u2019s \u2018the one\u2019, in his words. They ring the doorbell. We open the door. She looks exactly like her pictures, which is a great start. My son is grinning ear to ear - another great start. We invite them in. She accepts my hug and a firm handshake from my husband, and then she opens her mouth:    \u201cI\u2019m the one your son puts his penis in.\u201d    To be frank, I was appalled. I expected my husband to laugh (both he and my son are jokesters, and as annoying as it can be I love it) but THIS was just too much for me. Maybe I\u2019m reserved, but of all things she could have shared about my son she told us THAT. One look at my face and my husband knew how much I disapproved.  Maybe I let my expectations get too high, and it\u2019s unfair to have them, but I reiterate: of all things to say to her boyfriend\u2019s parents - whom she\u2019d never met - she chose THAT? My son was amused at first but when he noticed my reaction his face dropped.  I felt like he\u2019d sold me the full package, everything he\u2019d always been looking for in a girlfriend. I was too disturbed by the visual it put in my head, and it translated into anger. I told her to get out, and I wanted to say more about how gross it made me feel but I fortunately left it at that. My son didn\u2019t want to go, insisting I give her another chance, but I was too fed up and uncomfortable by this point. Even my husband, who\u2019s enjoyed his fair share of raunchy jokes, wouldn\u2019t let up.  They left and I immediately felt guilty. This was something my son had really looked forward to and I feel like I took that away over a dumb joke. I tried calling to apologize but he hasn\u2019t responded. My husband thinks she\u2019s the one who should apologize. I\u2019m considering giving her another chance, but before I do, was I the AH? EDIT: I should clear some things up:  My husband had no part in my reaction, I did the kicking out, not him. I don\u2019t want him taking the fall for this. He said she should apologize, but I\u2019m not expecting an apology. Sorry for the confusion.  My son lives in a nearby state, it can take about an hour to get back to where we live. He also hasn\u2019t dated anyone seriously for a while, maybe a couple of years. He told us before that he wouldn\u2019t bring anyone home unless he\u2019s sure he wants a future with her. We\u2019ve been asking to meet her ever since he told us about her, but he wanted to be ready.  The comment about her looking like her picture shows my age, sorry for that! He\u2019s only shown us her photos she\u2019s sent him as he apparently didn\u2019t have any of them together (he hates taking pictures and apparently she\u2019s always teasing him about it). I don\u2019t think he\u2019d ever lie about who she is, but it\u2019s just a parental concern I\u2019ve subconsciously had. I felt the same way about my daughter\u2019s (then) boyfriend when we first met him. I don\u2019t have any criteria that either of my kids\u2019 spouses need to meet, I just hope my kids are happy with them.  What I meant by her being \u2018the full package\u2019 was indicative of what he\u2019s told us about her. As his parents we have a good idea of what he looks for in a partner and she checked off everything based on what we\u2019d been told. And on top of everything (aside from what she said) her appearance was how she presented it to be. Again, we aren\u2019t strict about appearances, it\u2019s just a relief to have met someone for the first time and they look like what you\u2019d expected. My husband said that I was worried about \u2018second-hand catfishing\u2019 if that\u2019s even a thing lol. I guess it shows how anxious I was about this. Also thank you for your comments and rewards! I\u2019ve had a fee people reach out to me personally, too, thank you for that. Regardless of where you stand, I appreciate it. I personally think everyone needs some room for improvement here but I\u2019ve done my part to make amends and I\u2019m waiting on my son to call me! I\u2019ll be sure to give an update about how it goes. UPDATE: Thanks for reaching out everyone. My son got in touch with me. His girlfriend agreed to try again. We all met at a restaurant my son and his girlfriend chose. The first thing she said was an apology for what she said. I apologized for my reaction. We hugged. It was nice. She then explained how my son had convinced her a joke like that would land well, and that she wouldn\u2019t have said it if she didn\u2019t think we\u2019d like it. According to my son, she was reluctant to open with any jokes at all, but they came up with that one together on the way over. You guys were right!  She\u2019s a really sweet girl. She\u2019s actually very mature, too. I see why my son likes her so much. My husband and I really like her, we told our son to bring her when he visits. We look forward to seeing them again. Overall, I\u2019m glad we could start over. On the right foot this time. Thanks, everyone for your input.",

        "selftext": "My wife and I have always dreamed of celebrating our 40th anniversary with a luxurious vacation. Just the two of us, reliving the romance of our early years. We had it all planned out for years now and were excited beyond words.\r  \r  Enter our adult daughter Jane. Jane and her husband got wind of our plans and promptly invited themselves and their two children (9F, 5M) along. I originally put my foot down and told them this trip was just for us which upset her some. But my wife has a hard time saying no to Jane, as she is the youngest of our children and our only daughter, and she didn't want to hurt her feelings, so she reluctantly agreed to let them join.\r  \r  I wasn't thrilled about it at the time, but I wanted to make my family happy, and I knew my wife was also okay with the idea of a family trip even if she was heartbroken we wouldn't get our romantic trip. We went along with it. The place we were originally going was not child friendly so we changed course and decided on an all inclusive family friendly resort. We paid for the resort and our grandchildren's plane tickets. Jane and her husband only had to pay for their own airfare.\r  \r  Here's where things get complicated. As the vacation got closer, I started having a change of heart. I realized that our 40th anniversary was a once-in-a-lifetime milestone, and I wanted to honor it in a way that was true to our original plans. My wife and I might not be able to afford a trip like this again for quite some time and it's something we always wanted to do.\r  \r  So, without consulting anyone, I switched our tickets last minute to go to the romantic destination that my wife and I had originally planned for. I did not tell Jane or her husband. I didn't even tell my wife until the day before our flight left, which was a day before Jane's flight left for their vacation.\r  \r  It wasn't an easy decision and I feel guilty about it. But I wanted our 40th anniversary to be the special, intimate celebration we had always hoped for.\r  \r  We called Jane after we landed to tell her and she was extremely upset to say the least. She seemed of the idea that we were going to look after our grandkids so she and her husband could have alone time and now that I abandoned her they would have to do it all themselves. I hung up on them when my son in law started shouting and my wife and I enjoyed the rest of our trip.\r  \r  They came back the same day we did but have not answered any of our texts and Jane seems to be ignoring me. My wife told me she vastly preferred our trip to the family trip we would have taken but she still doesn't like how Jane is mad at us and wants me to apologize. I'm not sure I want to after learning Jane and her husband were using us for free babysitting and a free trip but I feel like I should just to keep the peace.\r  \r  Am I the asshole for changing our trip destination last minute and leaving Jane and her family to fend for themselves?",

        "selftext": "Yesterday while I was making lunch I heard a really loud sound, as if the ceiling was falling or a bookshelf had fallen.  My husband (41M) and daughter (17F) were out, the only other person in the house was my son (16M). I was pretty sure he was in his room, which is at the opposite side of the house from the kitchen, so while making my way there I checked every room and everything seemed in order.  I knocked on my son\u2019s door and called his name, no answer. I must have knocked/called 3 times before trying to open the door which was locked.  At this point I was getting really freaked out, thinking that maybe he tipped his wardrobe or bookshelf and it had fallen over him and he was passed out on the floor. I was basically screaming his name, no answer.  I have no idea how I did it. I just threw myself the door and it broke. Now, clearly the door was already weak (I\u2019m thinking termite?) but, yeah, it broke.  My son was fine. He was freaked out about the door but fine. The sound was his TV with the volume at the max, apparently. And he didn\u2019t answer me calling because he didn\u2019t want me bothering his movie. His words were \u201cYou were screaming like a harpy and it was annoying, I was trying to watch the movie. Fix the door.\u201d  I said no. I wasn\u2019t going to fix it since to \u201cfix it\u201d I would have to buy a new door and doors are expensive. And as soon as his dad got home he would remove the door entirely as it was too broken to just stay there.  He got really mad. Said it\u2019s his \u201cright\u201d to have a door, he deserves his privacy. I said he had a door and while I was the one that broke it and it was a consequence of his actions, so if he wanted a door he would have to buy it (I know he doesn\u2019t have the money for it right now). Until then, no door. He can change in the bathroom. He said fuck you, I said he was grounded.  AITA about the door? My husband is fine with it, says only I know how scared I was, so only I can know the appropriate punishment. I\u2019m now terrified that if anything happens where we really need to reach my son, we won\u2019t be able to. But I have calmed down since and I\u2019m wondering if maybe I\u2019m the asshole.",

So my (35M) wife (32F) is pregnant. She\u2019s due in 2 weeks and i am beyond excited because this would be my first child and I\u2019ve always wanted to be a dad. Yesterday, we were in bed together, talking about our baby. All of a sudden she jumps up excited with a huge smile on her face. She told me to stay on the bed because she had a surprise for me. She went into our closet and grabbed a box. It was decorated with ribbons and bows so I assumed it was a gift for me. She handed it to me with the same big grin on her face. It was obvious she was excited to see me reaction. I asked her what it was but she just kept on saying \u201copen it open it!\u201d I opened it and inside was a blue onesie with the name \u201cbartholomew\u201d in cursive stitched on the middle. Now, I had agreed that I\u2019d let my wife name the baby since she was the one giving birth and I felt as if it would be something really special for her so I trusted she\u2019d name my son something at least normal. I asked her what it meant and she said \u201csurprise!! That\u2019s going to be his name.\u201d She sounded so happy and enthusiastic so I knew she was serious. I busted out laughing to the point of tears. I honestly could not believe she was going to name our son that. What the hell kind of name is \u201cbartholomew\u201d???? She got really silent and started tearing up. When I noticed this, I sat up and stopped laughing. She snatched the box off me and stomped back to the closet. I asked her if she was serious and she said yes. Apparently she\u2019s decided to name our son after her grandfather who she was very close with before he died. I told her that she should think about this because it\u2019s an \u201coutdated\u201d name. She started yelling at me saying I was judging my son before he even came out the womb. She stormed out and is now staying at her moms. I honestly can\u2019t believe she\u2019s serious. Her dad called me yelling at me because apparently she\u2019s told on me. I\u2019ve been called immature and a joke so far. I\u2019ll probably just apologize but there is no way in hell I\u2019m calling my son by that outrageous name.

        "selftext": "Me (25m) and my wife (23f) are having our first child together. She is currently 9 months pregnant and could give birth anytime in the next couple of weeks. The only major fight we have had throughout her pregnancy happened a couple days ago, and it was about what we were going to name our kid.\r  \r   It all started when we found out the gender of the baby. We didn\u2019t do a gender reveal and decided to find out the gender at one of her checkups because we didn\u2019t want to spend time making two lists of names then have to get rid of one after. So after we found out we were having a boy we sat down together and made a list. Almost all of the names she suggested were normal, until the one that caused me to write this post. She suggested we name our son Mune. She told me the name was from this movie she watched when she was younger and that it always stuck with her. I told her the name was a little out there and he would get made fun of for it. She claimed he wouldn\u2019t and we started going back and forth trying to decide whether to add the name to the list or not. Eventually she agreed to keep the name off the list, we picked some that we liked, and I thought that was that.\r  \r   Later on in her pregnancy her mom decided to throw a baby shower as it was her first grandchild, and my wifes pregnancy was almost over and we hadnt celebrated once. It was fine for the most part until we started to open the gifts. Most of them were normal baby things like diapers and bottles, until we got to her moms gift. My wife opened the gift bag and pulled out a blue handmade blanket. It seemed normal enough at first until my wife unfolded it and low and behold there was the name Mune written on the blanket. When I saw it i was pissed but didn\u2019t want to cause a scene so i stayed quiet. After that reveal I had family members come up to me and ask me about the name and why i hadnt told them. I didnt know what to tell them as i didnt have a clue about this either and just had to embarrassingly tell my family that, which pissed me off even more.\r  \r   Once the event ended and me and my wife went home I started to question her about the name. She got defensive and told me that it was a good name and that i was overreacting about it. I brought up the earlier points and told her it was a stupid name for a kid and if she wanted to name something Mune so bad she could use the name for a dog. She got upset and called her mom to come get her. After she left she called me and told me she wouldn\u2019t be coming back for awhile. Everyone ive talked to about this has said im not the asshole, but now that my wife has been gone and ive been thinking about it I feel like I could have handled the situation better. Aita?\r  ",

        "selftext": "My wife and I have 3 kids. Tina (19f), Jason (15m) and Ally (14f).Late last year, my SIL passed away unexpectedly leaving our niece Jenny (4f) orphaned (her father is not in the picture). My wife and I, of course, agreed to take her in.  It has been a huge adjustment for all 6 of us. Tina and Ally had to start rooming together. Ally is OK with this, but Tina has complained since we brought our niece home. In fact, whenever Jenny does anything typical of a 4 year old that Tina dislikes she will loudly and rudely comment that THIS is why I am childfree and will never have kids!  A few weeks ago there were big changes in our childcare coverage and now we lack coverage for about 2 and a half hours mon-fri.  Jason and Ally both agreed to take 1 day of the week for babysitting duties, when we asked Tina to take on the other 3, she refused stating she is child free and means it.  I told Tina that if she won't pitch in to help the family by babysitting, then she was no longer welcome to live in our home rent-free. I told her what we would be charging for her room and board and she had a meltdown She did a lot of yelling and screaming but when she realized I was serious about kicking her out if she didn't pitch in, she agreed to take on the 3 days of babysitting.  Our relationship has been tense. Tina says I am not being fair because she has to take 3 days when Jason and Ally only have to take 1 day each. I explained it is because they are still in highschool and both are involved in after school activities while she takes college classes part time and online while only working weekends. Also because she is an adult and the other two are not. She has also called me sexist and says I am discriminating against her beliefs.  Am I the asshole for forcing my adult daughter's hand in this? ETA: We can't really afford an outside babysitter right now. This was the reasoning behind charging my daughter room and board. I currently pay her school fees, car payment, car insurance, phone bill, all of her groceries, health insurance, and utilities. I was charging her less in room and board then what her lifestyle costs monthly.  If she doesn't want to babysit she is free to stay here IF she pays the amount we said in room and board. She would have to take on more hours at work to do so though. EDIT 2: Thank you reddit. Looks like the consensus is NTA. I appreciate everyone who voted in support AND for those of you who voted YTA, I appreciate you too! You've given me some valuable insight into how my daughter may be feeling.  A couple things: My daughters monthly expenses are generally $1200+ a month. A big portion of this is taken up by her car payment and car insurance ($590) and her grocery bill ($300) as she follows a vegan diet the rest of the family does not. We were planning to charge her $600 for her room and board. That was the amount we needed in additional household income for everyone to maintain the same quality of life and afford to hire an outside sitter (which would cost as $800-$900 a month) There is no child support or government assistance. My niece and SIL were not US citizens at the time of her passing. My niece's biological father is incarcerated in their home country. He won't be out until my niece is pushing 30. We took on a fair amount of debt (five figures worth) in order to facilitate the international adoption. Sending niece back to her home country was never an option as it has high crime, high poverty, and lots of government corruption. Her mom died while visiting the states. If I had a time machine and could go back and do it all again... Maybe I'd soften the blow to my daughter and explained things differently. However all my ultimate decisions would have been the same. Niece would still be adopted. Tina would still have to share a room. Tina would still have to either babysit 3 days a week, pay the $600 we asked her to, or move out. None of that would have changed or will change.  I love all my kids. I love my niece and she IS my kid too now. My wife, kids and I are all she has in this world now. While I understand that this is a frustrating situation for my eldest daughter (and my younger kids as well, but they are taking it in stride!) The mere fact of the matter is my niece has more NEEDS right now than Tina does. It sucks but sometimes families need to shift resources during family emergencies and crisis.",

        "selftext": "So I, 27F, am a black African woman. I'm living and working in Germany for a fixed period on secondment. While here, I became quite friendly with a colleague, 60F, and she invited me to her daughter's wedding. I was excited as I've never been to a white wedding. I asked if there was a dress code/colour scheme to adhere to since it wasn't specified on the invite. I was told the code is dress to impress. Bet.  Day of the wedding, I understand the assignment. I wear my traditional wear, which is really beautiful and obviously not German. The garment is green, so np problem there. Or so I thought. I get a lot of questions and compliments at the wedding, which I genuinely downplay because its not my day.  My colleague seems colder than usual but I pay it no mind since she's mother of bride and could be preoccupied. The bride is downright rude to me, but again i give her grace. I congratulate her and thank her for including me and I get a tight \ud83d\ude10 in response.  I keep to the edges of the room as the music isn't really my vibe, and I'm just observing how European weddings work. I leave around 8 (after 5 hours) and go home before the wedding finishes.  Monday I walked into whispers in the office, people actually strangely and more reserved than usual. An office friend pulls me aside and fills me in: brides mother is fuming. My outfit was too extravagant, OTT and inappropriate. I drew attention from the bride and commandeered the room: I was rude and disrespectful. She's told people all about it, apparently.  I approach MOB and ask to speak but she says she has nothing to say to me. I ask her why she has sth tk say everyone else about me but not to me, and she calls me an insolent child. I explain to anyone who scolds me that this was my first white people wedding: I specifically asked what to do wear and followed the guidelines. Where I'm from, there's no such thing as outshines g the bride - weddings are a fashion show and a chance to wear your best and brightest clothes. They told me this isn't africa (which was racially coded) nd people here have manners. I laughed and told that person to go to hell, so she's telling people I lack remorse for my behaviour.  I'm wondering if I really am the asshole though? Edit: the dress inspo I showed to my tailor is now on my profile to help you.  Edit 2:  I'm about to board a flight. Someone told me to go back to my country so I'm doing just that \ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06 Thanks for the feedback. I'm guessing not the asshole but could have inquired further/done research - fair.  Some of yall are so pressed about the WP wedding - it literally means it's the first wedding I've been to where the bride, groom, and wedding party are white. It's really not that deep.  Thanks for the engagement and see ya \ud83d\ude0a ",

        "selftext": "New to reddit, please bare with.  So I (21, guy) live with my childhood best friend (22, also a guy) and have done for 2 years now. Up until last week, things were perfect between us.  However, he recently got a new girlfriend (23, lady) and she honestly seems absolutely great except for one thing; she seemingly has a complete aversion to knocking. She and I have quite a lot in common, and I actually like spending time with her. However it bugs the hell out of me when she just barges into my room without knocking first. Now, she's never walked in on me doing anything untoward; I'm usually just chilling on my bed or studying at my desk. However, on at least seven seperate occasions now she's done it first thing in the morning to ask if I want coffee. I sleep naked. Every time prior to the last one, I've been under the covers and she hasn't seen anything. I always point out that she *could* have and she just giggles and says but I didn't.  When she stayed over last week, in order to make my point, I intentionally slept on top of the covers. Sure enough, she barges in at 7AM, begins to ask if I want coffee and sees my you-know-what. She immediately backed out of the room and didn't speak to me for the rest of the day. My mate later pulled me aside and said I was bang out of order, accused me of deliberately exposing myself and pointed out that I'd threatened to do it before (I literally just said okay but what if I had no covers and you saw everything before). They're now framing this to others that I'm some sick creep who intentionally got naked and lay in wait of her because that's how I get my rocks off, and I'm kinda seeing how it came off that way. AITA for doing this?",

        "selftext": "[Update here.](https://www.reddit.com/user/Remarkable-Use-8439/comments/10s5t37/update_aita_for_missing_an_actual_emergency/) My best friend (31m) and I (27m) have a tradition of taking a yearly weekend trip together that's phone-free. We've been doing this for a decade now. These weekend trips consist of us staying in a suite and exploring the city, not traversing the wilderness so it's not like we're completely disconnected. Still, we liked to keep one on hand for navigation and emergency purposes, and it would usually be Friend's phone that we brought along. Friend and I left for our trip this year two Fridays ago to make use of the long weekend. This was the first time I've gone one on of these trips since my wife and I moved in together, got engaged, or got married. However, we were dating for the last two years worth of trips (2021 and 2022), and she seemed fine during that time. I would just tell her I was going to be busy for the weekend and she'd leave me alone. I understand that there are different expectations once you get married, but I didn't expect for the 180 in behavior. My wife all but demanded I take my phone as well in case she needed to get ahold of me despite her having Friend's number. I let her know I had arrived and immediately after that she was texting me and asking me how things were. Then again, asking me another question when I didn't respond to the first one. I eventually muted our text conversation because I was sick of the phone buzzing. She called me a few hours later and asked why I wasn't responding to her texts. I reiterated that this was supposed to be a no phone weekend and kept the call short despite her trying to drag out the conversation. She called me once more after this. When I answered and found out it wasn't an emergency, I simply turned off my phone. The calls then started coming in for my friend and he followed suit. We spent the rest of the weekend with our phones off until the drive back on Monday. I called my wife and informed her when we were about 30 minutes away from my place and she was furious. She said that there ended up being an emergency (her sister got into a car accident that won't affect her long-term, but still resulted in broken bones) and that I had just ignored her the entire time when she 'needed me.' I told her that I was very sorry to hear about her sister, but it wasn't my fault she had essentially forced my hand into cutting off means of communication. She went to stay with a friend before I arrived home that night and has since came home, but she's still fuming. AITA? EDIT: I'm politely asking everyone to stop making harmful accusations about my friend and the nature of our relationship when we were younger. It's making me uncomfortable, and not in the 'I'm having an epiphany' way you guys are hoping, but in the 'you're jumping to incredibly crude conclusions about someone I love and trust based on a tiny snippet into our life.' EDIT 2: Thank you for all the kind messages. I just checked them expecting more anger but instead have found lots of compassion. I appreciate that so much.",

I met the love of my life. We decided to tie the knot. From the beginning I told my parents how I am worried my sister will ruin another special moment in my life. My mom told me over and over again it would not happen. The day of my wedding. I received a voicemail from my mom saying they couldn\u2019t come because my sisters dog was sick and she was upset. I was hurt, my best man however is a jokester. He took my phone then went to my fianc\u00e9 and asked if he could post a video of our wedding as a gift? On social media. She loved his idea. I had no idea about it until I came home. Our honeymoon was at a lake side cabin. No cell service. The post caption was \u201cMy best friend. He is an amazing person even if his parents NEVER showed up for him.  video was still pictures of us next to her parents, me on the dance floor, cutting the cake. Where you would normally see both parents in wedding pictures. The sound behind the video was my moms voice mail explaining how they couldn\u2019t come because my sisters dog was sick. I came home a week later to hundreds of messages.Family members from both sides insisting I take it down. I was told my sister hasn\u2019t stopped crying. My mom is refusing to leave the house.

        "selftext": "****UPDATE POSTED IN MY PROFILE**** Brief backstory: About a year ago my last remaining grandparent passed away and my father inherited all assets, including a house. I had been saving for a nice down payment (at least 50%) so I could have a lower mortgage payment each month, thus allowing me to save money for travel. When my father inherited this house, which he had no interest in moving into yet, he offered to sell it to me for slightly below market rate, with the caveat that he and my stepmother could eventually move into the basement apartment. I agreed, because they're both incredible people who are not at all invasive and would give me my privacy if they lived there. So I paid a 60% down payment, financed the rest, and moved in.  Present day: About six months ago I started considering renting out the finished basement apartment. It has two bedrooms, one bathroom, a living room, and a small kitchenette (sink, fridge, microwave, but no oven). A friend of mine said his brother was moving to my city and needed a place. He's a brand new teacher and doesn't make great money, so he needed a place that wasn't expensive. I offered to let him rent my basement for way less than market rate ($650) which would include utilities. He readily accepted and signed a year long lease. Well a few days ago he asked if he could start paying the landlord directly instead of giving me rent money each month. I was under the impression my friend had told him I own the house, so I was confused and I told him we don't have a landlord and that I'm the owner. He got very upset and screamed at me for lying for over six months and taking advantage of him by making him pay so much in rent. For the record, an apartment similar to the one in my house would be well over twice what he's paying me, closer to three times for something as nice. He asked how much of my mortgage he's covering and I said Why does that matter? You're getting a nice, quiet place to live, access to a full kitchen and laundry room, and you're paying an amount that you can afford. My personal finances aren't really a factor here. He stormed out of the room and slammed the basement door. He's still not speaking to me. I asked a few other friends and some family members, and most said I'm wrong for having him cover my mortgage payments. Only a few say I'm in the right. So AITA for having my roommate cover $650 of my $775/month mortgage? ETA: He has a lease so I won't be evicting him over this alone. If he does any damage or becomes hostile, I'll look at the eviction process. But for now, he will remain unless he chooses to break the lease (which I'd allow him to do if he wants).  He also didn\u2019t bother to read the lease before signing. The lease clearly states I\u2019m the homeowner. I didn\u2019t trick him or keep info from him. He simply didn\u2019t read what he was signing. I didn\u2019t get the house for almost free as some people choose to believe. My father sold it to me for about 75% of its value, more or less as an advance on \u201crent\u201d he and my stepmother will pay when they move in here in a few years. We already agreed they won\u2019t pay monthly rent but will contribute to utilities and groceries at that time. I also made a 60% down payment so I have quite a bit invested, as well at paying about $1500/month out of pocket for taxes, insurance, maintenance, utilities, etc.",

They've done stuff like forcing him to play chess 4 times in a raw, secretly slashed his tires to see if he'd fix it himself like a man or get help like those lazy guys, They'd asked him questions like what joke he'd like to tell his future MIL, his opinions on abortion, jesus, gender equality etc. They also tested his fishing and hunting skills, overwhelmed him with hypothetical scenarios to test his decision making abilities/mental strength. They kept calling him slow and soft but he has medical condition (asthma) but they think he's making 'excuses'. I demanded they stop, but dad said this is just typical stuff men challenge each others with and said that I was ruining the fun.  Last week, They took Tim on a 3 day trip and hid his inhaler, he left them and returned in 7hrs and told me, I was seething after he said they admitted to hiding it as a challenge, I exploded on them when they returned. Cousin asked if little timmy ran to me to tattle. I yelled that all 4 of them are uninvited to my wedding. My brother freaked out saying it was a prank and they were going to give it back, Dad said they'll apologize if I insist but Tim will have lost the little respect they'd gained for him and in their eyes will always be the soft college kid who's not up for the challenge. I called him and the others awful then I left.  My cousin is begging that we talk, my uncle has been quiet, but dad is so mad and now he's getting mom involved to get me to reconsider this decision.

He really is a wonderful chef and all our friends enjoy the dishes he brings to parties. Whereas I will admit I don't know my way around the kitchen and have never taken the time to really dive into it. This is fine since he cooks, but his meals usually include too much heat. He cooks with a lot of spices, sauces, and peppers. I've asked him time and time again to tone it down since I can't handle the heat. Or at least add those last so he can still have them but my dish will be fine. He says this will ruin the dishes and they won't come out as flavorful and be really lackluster. And that added the spice at the end ruins the whole balance of it. I finally snapped the other night and yelled at him to stop making hot dishes I can't eat and he told me that I was always welcome to cook my own meals if I wanted. I don't see why I have to cook if he already is making the meal, he can just add less spice to it. That will add so much more time to my night when he is already handling that chore. So AITA for yelling at him after him adding spice too many times to dishes?",

She was a single mom of three kids when we started dating, she had two daughters (now 10 & 12) and a son (now 16). I\u2019ve watched these kids grow up, I\u2019ve read the bedtime stories, done bath time, the first days of school, pta meetings, all of it. I very much consider them to be my kids, and they\u2019ve been calling me mom for almost 6 years now. My brother Ivan (28m) just had a baby girl with his fianc\u00e9 Sara (27f). I love my niece, and my kids adore their cousin. My kids have been the only grandchildren on my side of the family since Ava and I got together, and there\u2019s never been a moment where the kids and my wife were treated like they didn\u2019t belong.My brother is their uncle, my mom and dad are their nana and pop\u2014 the kids see my family as their family and I always thought that my family felt the same way about them. The kids and I were over at my brother's house just hanging out, and my parents ended up dropping by with gifts for my niece.Ivan laughed when he saw the toys and told our mom and dad that they were going to end up spoiling her rotten. My mom said since my niece is their first grandchild of course they have to spoil her. My kids were sitting in the living room with all of us and my youngest daughter looked hurt when she realized what my mother said. My son and my 12yo didn\u2019t fully react to it, but I could tell it bothered the both of them too. Sara spoke up and said \u201coh you mean first grandbaby, not first grandchild.\u201d My dad shook his head and replied that my niece was their first grandchild. I didn\u2019t want my kids to keep sitting there and listening to that so I handed my son my keys and told him to wait in the car with his sisters. When they were gone, I asked my parents why the hell they\u2019d say that my kids weren\u2019t their grandchildren, and my mom said they couldn\u2019t be their grandchildren because they weren\u2019t really my children. My wife and I were going to be hosting thanksgiving at our house this year, but I told my parents that if they didn\u2019t view my kids as their family, then they could just host a meal at their own house with their \u201creal\u201d family while I spent the holiday with mine. I left before they could say anything else to me, and my wife and I have reiterated to the children that they will always be my kids and I will always be their other mom, regardless of our DNA. My brother is pissed at me now because he thinks I reacted too harshly, and that I should try to see where my parents are coming from. My mom texted saying that she and my dad love the kids, but they still aren\u2019t their grandchildren, and she hopes that we can come to understand that because she doesn\u2019t want this to ruin my niece\u2019s first thanksgiving. I haven\u2019t replied back. I meant what I said, but I\u2019m worried that maybe I\u2019m reacting too harshly. ETA INFO: I adopted all three of the kids about 4 years ago, so they aren't just my parents step grandchildren. Even if I hadn't legally adopted them, they'd still be my kids in my eyes. Edit no.2: - My wife's parents don't have a relationship with the kids. When my wife came out, they pretty much stopped speaking with her entirely.- Their bio dad is not involved and neither is his family. He lost his rights to the children before Ava and I started dating. The 10yo has never met him, the 12yo doesn't remember him, and the 16yo wants nothing to do with him.- My parents wanted the kids to call them Nana and Pop. I didn't make the kids start calling them that.",

My ex and I were married for 12 years, and have been divorced for 5 years, we have three kids together who are now teenagers. My ex and I got divorced because we were young when we met and got married and we grew apart as people. It was a mutual decision, and we agreed our kids came first and have always coparented very well. This has been the case up until the last year when his girlfriend moved in with him. Previously we would do holidays and kids birthdays together, now when she is present they won\u2019t even sit near me at our kids sporting events. I have always been nice to this women, despite my kids expressing they do not like her and they feel their dad acts differently when she is around. My ex told me early on she wasn\u2019t a fan of me and felt I intimidated her. When I asked him for examples of how intimidated her, he said it\u2019s my fave, that I have resting bitch face and it makes her uncomfortable. My ex and her got engaged over Christmas and my kids were less than thrilled, my daughter especially. She feels her dad made a major life decision without even talking to them about it first. My ex called me yesterday saying he is giving me a heads up that I have a year to change my last name back to my maiden name as his finance is expressing her distaste and concern for her and I to have the same last name when they get married. I told him we agreed in our divorce that I could keep his last name until I felt the need to change it, and that is what is listed in our paperwork. I also told him I don\u2019t want to have a different last name than our kids. He said I\u2019m being unreasonable and refusing to see how this would make his finance uncomfortable. I told him I can\u2019t see it from her side because I am a grown up, and not an immature child like she is. He told me I could ask anyone about this situation, and everyone would agree with her.

        "selftext": "Update :https://reddit.com/u/Justanaunt2/s/VhlPPq6vGy I (F42) live with my husband (M45) and our daughters (F18 & F16). We live in a different city from our families due to work.  A few months ago my sister asked me if her daughter Kate (F19) can stay with us since she was starting college in our city. She was scared of her daughter moving away for first time, especially to a big city like ours.  I knew Kate from before Covid time and remembered her to be a smart sweet kid. I discussed with my husband and we agreed she can stay with us.  Kate moved in around two months back. She was fine, came home on time, let us know her whereabouts, no partying.  The issue was with food. She had turned vegan.  Normally I cook for my family. I cook just one meal for all. And we are all diary obsessed people. Milk for cereal, butter in pancakes, cheese in everything. Eggs were our staple.  Kate needed separate dishes altogether and we needed vegan substitutes for her. Since those are way more expensive, I told my sister she should give money to Kate so she can buy it. She stared telling me how family doesn't take money from family to feed kids. I told her I would feed Kate same as other kids but I won't spent excess money on her. She said thats fine.  Since her mom won't buy it, Kate started buying plant based substitutes with her pocket money. For dishes like pancakes, I made food for her using her incrediants.  But everytime I made a huge non vegan meal, she expected me to provide equivalent vegan meals. I drew line at that. I can't spend so much time cooking another meal. She said everyone else got to eat it while she was left with few stuff go eat. I told her she is free to cook for herself and she hated that idea.  It came to a boiling point last weekend when we had a barbeque dinner with friends. She got upset that her salad was very basic, (it was good only with chicken added) and had nothing else to eat. She complained and I told her she can cook for herself. She got even more upset at that and called her mom crying about how I didn't make any good meals for her and expected her to fend for herself.  My sister called me yelling at me how I didn't love her daughter and was intentionally excluding her. My parents are also taking their side.  AITA ?",

        "selftext": "So I (28f) am about 7-8 months pregnant and while I've thankfully not gained a lot of weight, my belly has grown a lot and I find that most of my underwear is too small and cuts into my sides/bottom of my belly. After a while I started getting a rash in the places where it was too tight due to friction I guess. So one day I was getting dressed and I was getting frustrated about the rash and the underwear being too small, so I figured I'd try on a pair of my husbands (29m) boxers. They're size L and too big for me, but OMG it was the most comfortable thing I've ever tried on in my life. Breezy and loose and even the places where I had the rash didn't hurt. My husband had already left for work for the day, so I decided to just borrow them. At the end of the day we both come home and I tell him that I borrowed his underwear and asked if it was okay to continue borrowing some until the baby comes (less than 2 months left) or at least until the rash is better. He seemed a bit weirded out but said it was okay. Fast forward a few days and we're going to bed and he flips out at me and asks me why I'm wearing his good bamboo underwear. I'm confused, but he points at the band where it says bamboo. Then he goes on a long rant about how his few pairs of bamboo underwear are the comfiest and best quality etc etc (I swear this is not an ad for bamboo underwear). I apologized and said I just picked the pair off the top just like I did the other times, but he was upset and said I wasn't allowed to borrow his underwear anymore. I said I wouldn't borrow the ones that said bamboo on them since it bothered him, but he just drew a hard line saying I should go buy bigger underwear for myself and stop stealing his. Now, I'm thinking this is probably more about how he actually doesn't want me to borrow his underwear, and he's using me accidentally taking the wrong pair as an excuse, but I'm not sure. So anyway reddit, AITA for thinking my husband should let me borrow his underwear? Or am I just entitled? Edit: due to character limit I had to remove some to make the edit, so I picked the parts people told me weren't relevant to the argument. I just wanted to thank everyone for sharing their opinions - this sure was a heated topic for many. My husband and I had a good time reading some of the responses, our favourite was the guy who said he'd kill anyone who touches his bamboo underwear. We agreed that it would be wise to buy some maternity underwear for me, that I can use after the birth too. Thank you all for the great suggestions! I hope you all have a lovely day! I am finally off to sleep :)",

I have not eaten meat since I was roughly 3-4 years old when I found out where meat comes from (spoiler alert: there were a lot of tears). This is no secret and everyone in my life knows and respects this - or so I thought.  Four nights ago, I was at a party and I will admit, I got white girl wasted. My friends thought it would be funny to feed me chicken nuggets as a prank. I checked with them before chowing down are these vegan? To which my friends replied yeah, they're sunfed (a type of vegan chickenless chicken). They tasted off to me but I figured it was just because I was drunk. I was wrong.  I found out the next day when my sister sent me a message telling me to check my friends Snapchat story. The story was them showing the nugget packaging, and then showing them giving them to me (including the conversation where I asked if it was vegan). The and then later them mocking me and pretending to be me when I found out I ate meat (things like fake crying and yelling the CHICKENS!!!). I took a screen recording of the video and took it to the police, on the grounds of food tampering, and now 3 of my (ex) friends are facing charges.  They all think that I'm overreacting to a 'harmless' prank, so Reddit, AITA? In my view, they took advantage of my drunken state, tampered with my food, and publically humiliated me. In their view, it was just a prank.",

I heard my wife scream HELP! So I ran over, and she was freaking out because an elderly women hugged our son, you can tell the women was harmless. The women's son came along and  profusely stating that she had dementia and she meant no harm, that she tends to view every child as her child. I said it was okay, and I myself apologized for my wife's overreaction. During this time I was not paying attention and my wife called 911, and called over security it became a huge mess for all parties because my wife was not letting the issue go. You could also tell the son was extremely embarrassed as was I. I was trying to relax my wife, but she was going on a complete meltdown rage saying that his mother should be in a home if she cannot keep her hands to herself. What if she got our kid sick, tried to kidnap him, got combative and hurt him. All of which I agree are possible outcomes, but I told her none of that happened so let's just leave it. Security states since the wife called the police we had to wait for them to show up, so they can file a report as per their store policy. About 25 minutes later police showed up and asked what happened and my wife explained everything, you can tell the police where like WTF is wrong with this women. I felt nothing but disappointment. Police took the statement and started laughing as they left. Gave the son of the elderly mom a fist bump and said sorry. My wife was upset I did not have her side, she was upset how I took the side of the son instead of her. I explained his mom was clearly sick, it was a harmless gesture and explained she was one that acted unreasonably. I did acknowledge her concerns, but nothing bad happened we could have just let is slide and went on with our day. She told me I failed as a husband. So we ran the story by our family and friends, it is a a 50/50 split. So my BIL said this would be a funny story for AITA, he frequents the sub. So reddit was I the AITA? Sorry forgot to add our kid is 19 months old. First and foremost thanks, secondly I just noticed I put overrated instead of overreacted. At this point I will see myself out, as a couple of posters suggested I asked my wife if she wants to share her side, at this point I am going to drop it, but if she wants to keep the civil war going that is on her. I will take the criticisms  and feedback to heart. Been a fun read though, back to my main and looking at BG3 subreddit. ",

About two years ago my brother, Greg (25M) married Cheryl (34F). Cheryl has a daughter from a previous relationship (Becca, 9F) who has several health conditions, including celiac and a severe dairy allergy that requires her to carry an epi-pen.  Last weekend I hosted a dinner at my house for my parents' wedding anniversary. I made a fancy five-course dinner and in addition to my parents, I invited four close family friends, Greg, Cheryl and Becca, and my sister, her boyfriend and their twins (both 8M). Because of Becca's food restrictions, I found a restaurant in town that specializes in gluten-free, dairy-free (as well as other allergen-free) food, and arranged for them to make a full meal for Becca that I could pick up in advance of the party. I have made a variety of speciality meals in the past (for example, keto meals when my friend was following that diet) and I like the challenge, but knowing how serious Becca's restrictions were, I didn't trust myself to make her meal. I have ADHD and get easily distracted, and if I even used the wrong spoon or didn't completely wash some flour off a bowl, it could make her incredibly sick.  I thought the take out solution was fine, but when I served the food, I saw Cheryl looking at Becca's plate with a stony face. For her part, Becca started eating and seemed fine. Cheryl whispered to Greg, and Greg asked if he could talk to me in the kitchen. When we got there he said that it was unbelievable that I couldn't be bothered to make something for Becca, that they'd been bragging about what a great cook I am to her, and that he knew I'd made keto, vegan, and other complicated kinds of food in the past; now she would feel left out because she didn't get to eat what the rest of the family was eating. He said that it was obvious that I didn't care about making his stepdaughter feel like a part of the family, and that they were leaving. Greg, Cheryl and Becca then left, which put a damper on the rest of the party.  I felt like I did my best at the time, but in hindsight, I wonder if I should have tried harder to make Becca feel included since she is a relatively new addition to our family. AITA?",

We have her for four days a week (M-T) while she's at her dad's Fri-Sun. From the beginning, Jane told me Emily doesn't need a second father figure as she has her dad to fill that role. I was only supposed to be a trusted authority figure in case she ever needed anything. I didn't mind and try my best to respect that boundary. She's a sweet child anyway and doesn't cause trouble so it's not like I have to discipline her. Her father is also a good dad. Emily's dad recently got married and his wife has two kids of her own who are at their place Wednesday to Saturday and at their dads' Sunday to Tuesday. Emily and her new step-siblings don't get along at all. They're always fighting and it's pretty toxic. Emily's dad asked Jane if they change their custody schedule to match his step-kids' to keep the children apart. It's not a big deal in and of itself because we don't live far from each other so picking and dropping is no issue and she can easily be dropped off to school no matter where she stays. The issue is my wife agreed to it without consulting me. Jane is currently doing a certification course for the next 12 months and they have classes on Saturdays from 9-5pm. She asked me if I can babysit Emily on Saturdays, but I can't because I play golf with my brother and sister on Saturday mornings from 8am-1pm. This has been our tradition from before Jane and Emily came into my life and I had told Jane from much before that this is important to me and my siblings. She asked if I can move to another day but that's not possible either because my siblings also have jobs and families of their own so Saturday was the best day for us. I told her she can hire a babysitter but she doesn't want to spend money when I can do it for free.  I told her that wouldn't work for me. She then got mad and said golf is stupid and I should put my step-daughter over my siblings. That pissed me off so I told her I'm not going to sacrifice my hobbies just so that she can have a free babysitter. For the record, I don't have anything against Emily. I've babysat her before and she's a good kid. If there was a family emergency or if it was an occasional occurrence, then yeah I would cancel golf for that day to take care of her but I can't give up something this important to me for 12 months continuous. She called me a selfish asshole and slept on the couch last night. So AITA?",

I (f21) as well as my 5 siblings (from 29 to 37 years old) have all been pranked on our birthdays and on Christmas and usually it\u2019s one or two gifts. This Christmas though, I was the only person to get all joke gifts. For example, I unwrapped a MacBook from my brother, but when I opened it, it was just some chocolate (which I don\u2019t eat so I gave it away) and the MacBook was actually given to my sister inside a bag she wanted. Another \u201cgift\u201d was what I thought was a book I put on my Christmas list was actually just the book cover put on a dictionary. When I asked my mom about the book she told me she gave it to my Sil This went on with each present my siblings or parents had given me. AirPods was just a charger block? Adapter? gift cards were used and had $0 balance, a card with Monopoly money, and so on totaling to about 12 joke gifts. I realized I went out of my way to get everyone something they wanted or they\u2019d like didn\u2019t get anything. At this point i was bummed so I went to the living room to watch tv with my boyfriend. At dinner they were all talking about how much they loved their gifts and when my dad asked why I hadn\u2019t said anything about mine, I said there wasn\u2019t much to say. Everyone but my boyfriend laughed and my mom said it was no big deal as everyone else also got some joke gifts. I told her every gift I got was a joke gifts and that the ones they got was also followed by the real one. My dad told me I needed to relax as I\u2019m making a big deal about it and I\u2019d have next Christmas to get the stuff on my list. Not wanting to go back and forth i told my boyfriend I wanted to leave and we can spend the rest of Christmas break with his family then go home. My family got mad and told me not to go and to just stay because it wasn\u2019t serious. I left and put my phone on do not disturb during the drive and by the time we got to bf\u2019s parent\u2019s house, I had several missed calls and texts from them calling me names like ungrateful, sensitive, and childish. They said I ruined Christmas and made my parents upset cause I left. The next day, I exchanged and opened gifts with my boyfriend and his family and one of the gifts I had gotten was the book I wanted (the book my mom pretended to gift me). I posted it on my instagram story and not even 0 minutes after posting it, my sister sent a screenshot of my story to the family group chat and they basically got mad at me for leaving and telling me I ruined Christmas over some presents. They told me I owe everyone, especially my parents, an apology because my mom spent new years sad because of my actions. Now I just want an outside party to tell me if I\u2019m TA here? Am I in the wrong for being upset about the gifts and for leaving? After reading their messages and sitting on this for a few days I\u2019m now feeling like maybe I was upset over nothing and need to apologize to them. *Gonna edit as there may have been some misunderstanding, my Christmas list didn\u2019t include expensive gifts nor was I upset I didn\u2019t receive expensive gifts. I was merely upset because of being pranked with everything I got and being the only person who didn\u2019t get a real present that is all. Another thing I\u2019ll address is I dint do anything to my family which would warrant them doing this. The last \u201cbig argument\u201d I had was with my sister which was over a year and a half ago. Thank you for the replies and I will try my best to reply to comments while I\u2019m at work. Editing once more to add I participated in joke gifts when I was a kid, haven\u2019t participated in the last 10+ years because I didn\u2019t enjoy it or find if funny (which thy do know). I will reply with more info if needed when I\u2019m on break or have time to reply. - and I am familiar with the term scapegoat but truthfully don\u2019t fully understand so I will research that as well.

        "selftext": "I F, 34 have been with my fiance M, 37 for 3 years. Getting married before the end of this year and recently moved in the house that I inherited from my mom. The house is in my name and it took a lot of talking and convincing from him to have his name on the title as well. Now honestly part of me doesn't think this is a good idea, at least not right now maybe after marriage? But anyway, I've decided to go ahead and put his name on the title so he could go ahead and start contributing towards mortgage more and light my burden a little bit.  We've made appointments, decided on which form of ownership we were basing this on. when it was time for me to sign the deed, My fiance stopped me and gave me a pen saying this pen was his lucky pen and told me to use it to sign the deed. I took it and tried to sign but turned out it was empty. He was like oh I must've forgotten while laughing and then pulled out his other lucky pen. I took it, tried to sign and that one too was empty. Honestly, seeing how he was laughing I figured he was messing with me but he swore he wasn't and pulled out ANOTHER one of his lucky pens. I tried that one too and it was empty. my fiance started cackling and I felt humiliated especially with how the gentleman next to him was staring. I got pissed and asked him what that was about and he said it was a prank. I asked really? Did you really think this was a time for pranks? He was like it's alright you can use a real pen now. I pushed the paper away and said you know what? Never mind because I no longer want you on the deed. He lost it completely saying we had a deal and I can't back out of it just like that, and that it was a stupid joke that I took too seriously. We had an argument and I refused to sign the deed at least not then and there.  At home he blew up again saying I was the one who delayed the process and that he already gave me a real pen and all I had to do was sign the damn paper and get it over with. He accused me of looking for an excuse not to have him on the deed and started the silent treatment saying there's nothing to say til those papers are signed. Did I really take this too seriously?",

        "selftext": "I f35 got engaged to my fianc\u00e9 Eric m37 2 months ago. He moved in with me and my daughter Zoey f13. Everything was going well til he started complaining about Zoey's cat which is strange because the cat is so sweet and quiet most of the time and so I had no idea what the issue was exactly. Anyways, he went from complaining about the cat to making demands about her. He gave Zoey a list of places the cat can/can't go, things she's allowed to touch, banned her from places like kitchen and sofa (Zoey's favorite place to cuddle with her cat). Zoey showed me this list and I had an argument with him telling him he needed to stop this because it was ridiculous. He ranted about this being his house too and how he expects things to change after we get married. Few days ago, I was at work and got a call from Zoey crying saying her cat wasn't in her room and in the house. I freaked out too and went home to look for her. Zoey and I looked for 2 hrs before a neighbor of ours brought her and told us that he saw Eric leaving her outside and getting in his car and leaving. I was surprised and quite angry. Zoey took her cat and went back inside. I immediately drove to my future inlaws home where Eric said he'd be. The second I saw him sitting with his family I went off and blew up at him infront of everyone. His mom asked what was happening and I told her her son got my daughter's INDOOR cat outside the house probably hoping for her to get lost. He argued about wanting me yo stop spouting nonesense and go home and we'd talk there but I refused. It got worse and I ended up leaving after his family flipped out at him. He sent a bunch of texts talking about the stunt I pulled infront of his family. He said that he didn't mean to leave the cat out but after checking the cams I confirmed it. He still insisted that I humiliated him infront of his family and tried to turn them against him. He's been staying with a friend and has stopped calling and texting. AITA for blowing up on him infront of his family? Here's some cat tax https://imgur.com/a/lOUovCh",

        "selftext": "I\u2019m going to be vague for privacy reasons, sorry.   I (33F) am the breadwinner of our household. I have multiple, highly specialized degrees for a niche industry. I make 200k+, with potential to get in the 600-M\u2019s range. My company has not been hit that badly by COVID, so most of us have kept our jobs, but we\u2019re held to strict standards.   My husband (36M) has a broad degree/work experience. He quit his job right before COVID hit, hoping for a better job in the meantime, and I was supportive. He spent a ton of time applying to various jobs, and finally landed an interview at Organization X.  This is his dream job, in almost every imaginable way (I can\u2019t be detailed). However, it\u2019s paying about 65k a year, which would be fine except this job directly puts my job stability at risk.  My company and this org. are adversarial, at best. My field is extremely secretive, and if clients discovered my spouse was working for a competitor, I would be permanently tainted. I wouldn\u2019t be able to get a job in the industry forever. I know this sounds like an exaggeration, but I promise you, it absolutely is not. It\u2019d be like if I worked in protecting the privacy of celebrities, and he worked for TMZ. If he tapped my car, got into my work devices, he could use that to advance his career, and any trust I have in this field will be gone. Even if I trusted my husband not to do that, my clients and company don\u2019t. Worse, b/c my background is so specialized, this is the only field I can work in.  I asked him to drop from consideration for this job, since if he got it, we\u2019d lose my income. 65k a year cannot support us in this city. Plus, he does not have to work for this organization. Even if the job market is awful right now, his background gives him access to a wide range of jobs, but I only have this one, niche field.  He was extremely angry, and said I was \u201cselfish and only cared about money.\u201d I told him that if he wanted to go back to school for an advanced degree or just be unemployed for a while, I would support him, but taking this job isn\u2019t possible.  He continued the process behind my back, and got the offer. He wants to accept it, b/c he says his career needs to take priority and that I wasn\u2019t being a supportive wife.  I feel so betrayed, and I\u2019ve contacted all relevant higher ups in my company to inform them. I notified them as soon as he got the interview, b/c it\u2019s better coming from my email than from a background check.  I told him he could decline the offer, w/me watching him physically decline it, or he could accept the offer and move out immediately. I would pay for him to stay two weeks at a hotel, and we would begin divorce proceedings. My company is willing to take care of all of my legal fees.  I feel fucking awful. I still love him. I moved decisively, b/c this was the best way to cut my losses, but it still hurts. He called me heartless and cold. It\u2019s true that I was prioritizing my career over his, but it felt like the only option at the time.",

        "selftext": "  I f32 gave birth to my son 5 weeks ago. My husband's mom has been camping in the living room ever since and inviting people over, making a mess in the house, etc. I said nothing because if I open my mouth, my husband would start scolding me saying his mom is there to help and I should be grateful. What I did was ignore her and focus on my son. I handle feeding, diaper change, cleaning, wiping. I only get a few hours sleep so my husband's mom isn't really helping with the baby. But I thought to myself well, at least she cooks for us!. Last night, I was in the bedroom breastfeeding my son. I knew I was late for dinner but I thought that my husband and his mom saved a plate for me. Once I got done with my son, I walked out the room and saw my husband and his mom sitting watching tv. I asked about dinner and my husband said it was probably on the stove. As I was walking towards the kitchen, his mom loudly said that she didn't save me any food. I was absolutely shocked I asked her why and she simply said Well, we didn't see you at dinner table so I thought you weren't hungry. I lost it and yelled that I was feeding my son OF COURSE I was hungry, I was actually starving!. She shrugged her shoulders and said it wasn't her fault I didn't show up for dinner but she knew damn well that I was with my son and hadn't eaten a thing in hours!. My husband asked me to not raise my voice at his mom but I told him that he saw what happened and didn't think about me being hungry and needing food. he lashed out asking what the fuck I wanted him to do and I said I don't know, maybe save some food for me? She defended him saying it was selfish of me to basically berate him for eating his dinner after working for long hours at the department. An argument ensued and I went inside the bedroom, packed a small bag for me and my son, called my brother to come take me to mom's house and my husband blew up at me as I was making my way out. We argued at the door and he told me that what I was doing was uncalled for and childish. I told him I couldn't take his mom anymore, he said I should be ashamed of myself for talking about her like that after she literally put her life on pause so she could help ME out. My brother came and I got into the car and left. He picked some food for me on the way and I ate like a hungry bear. My husband never stopped calling though. In his last text he called me nuts and demanded I return today but I said that I miss my mom, that I like it here in her clean home with her healthy food and would like to stay for a while. He's lost it and got his family involved accusing me of keeping his son away from him and punishing him over food.  **Edit...Ok, to those who are saying that I'm keeping my husband away from his son, I promise you that he has full access to him but chooses not to come over simply because he hats my mom and refuses to be with her in the same room. How long am I going to stay here??? There's no telling but at least I'm being pampered and treated like a princess by my mom, dad, brothers - heck, I couldn't get this treatment in my own home!. As for my husband, He can come over to mom's house if he wants to see his son so badly but I doubt he'll do it since he's a very prideful person and this might hurt his ego.** **one more question to answer cause a lot of people asked me to clarify. Yes, Department = Police Department. He's a police officer. I'm sorry if you got confused, but I thought it was clear.**    **Edit Ok, I felt sorry for him and decided to send him a couple of pictures that I took of our son sleeping and what was his respons? A long wall of text berating me left and right and claiming that I was rubbing it in his face that he can't come see his son because of you know what!!. He called me the b word which he never did til now and I'm shaken and so so mad right now because I really thought I was doing something nice and considerate after having sympathy for him. I've decided to get the rest of my stuff tomorrow because I need more time and space to be able to think about what he's done and said. I feel terrible right now but at least I got dinner for tonight, unlike when I was at my own home when his mom first came** **Edit. OH MY GOD, I can't even find a place to start with this. So he just sent me a picture of him and his mom cooking dinner in the kitchen (it's nearly 7 pm here) saying that he was repaying me for the pictures I sent earlier and that they were making dinner and they were not including me for real this time ?????? I just....Oh my God I'm literally laughing like, seriously, what is this? I'm truly speechless!. I haven't responded to this (yet) and I don't think I will because I'm so angry right now and may just regret the words that I say to him. I'm gonna put the phone on silent or something for now because I don't want them to ruin yet another night but tomorrow I'm going to collect more of mine and my son's stuff so I could stay longer at my mom's house. Thank God I went anonymous with this and I might update later if anything new happens. Goodnight!** **Edit. God I can't believe I'm back on here, but he just sent me a text saying he's only willing to come over IF I could get mom out of the house tomorrow, like literally have her leave her own house! He said it's just for 2 hours so he could see his son and also talk (he doesn't even know I'm coming over tomorrow to pick more stuff for me and the baby). I'm freaking out! Like absolutely no, not happening. I wouldn't dream of telling mom to leave her own house, that's crazy out of line request!!!. I'm not sure wether to respond or what I should say to him but I'll try to get some sleep then see how it goes in the morning!. I'm too tired to do anything but I Just wanted to put this here for those who just read my thread, I'll let you know what happens tomorrow. Aright!.**",

I already had a folded piece of paper out but he snatched it then started screaming at me about how I have no respect for his privacy and that I shouldn't be getting my hands on his things. I was genuinly dumbfounded I told him to take it easy I alwaye do this before laundry. He lashed out saying I had no right and should've come to him and asked him first because he was worried about important documents getting lost like the one I pulled out. I said important documents shouldn't be inside his pockets and asked to see the paper but he said he won't show me. I asked why and he said I don't get to ask him jack shit after I disrespected his privacy. I almost laughed because what privacy does he have in pockets? It wasn't like a stranger was digging into them.  He refused to speak to me and later brought a new closet with A LOCK and moved his clothes inside of it. I asked if he was serious and he said this will teach me to respect his privacy and deter my snooping. Then went back to not speaking to me. I'm genuinely confused, AITA?",

I asked where he was going and he said he & family were going to eat out but I wasn't invited because his mom assumed that since I wouldn't be familiar with the food and how to eat it it there at the restsurant, then it's better for me to stay-in and eat at the hotel. I didn't argue I just let him go then I packed and took the first flight home. He freaked out and called many times and when he found out that I went home, he blew up snd called me ridiculous and irrational to do this. Even said that I acted in an ungrateful manner and embarrassed him infront of his family after he literally begged to have me go on the trip. We argued and he started giving md silent treatment after he came home. Moreover, his family are indirectly criticizing me on facebook about what I did.  Did I overeact? Edit1 he didn't even mention what type of food they ordered. Edit2 the family didn't plan on having me come along but my husband, like he said begged them to invite me.

        "selftext": "My f25 husband's m30, brother (BIL) m33 moved in with us after his divorce few weeks ago. The problem I have is that he started barging in to the bathroom whenever I'm using it. He never knocks or anything. Another thing is that he only does this when it's me in the bathroom not his brother. I told my husband about what I'd noticed but he laughed it off and called me paranoid. It was embarrassing because his brother would see me exposed and it made me uncomfortable. My husband said he spoke to him and he apologized but did it again. When my husband and I got married, we promised to not have locks or lock each other out of any room. So the bathroom didn't have a lock. I was really considering getting a lock and I let my husband know that if his brother walks in on me in the bathroom one more time then a lock will instantly be installed. He didn't say anything. Well, Yesterday, BIL walked in on me showering. He knew I would be in the shower but barged in anyone claming he needed to pee. I had enough I went out and got a lock and installed it. My husband got home, saw it and blew up on me saying I voilated an agreement that I was part of and went against his wishes being uncomfortable with locks in the house. He demanded I remove it and *promised* and *guarenteed* that his brother won't walk in on me again but I refused.  He's been pissed about it since then and is giving the silence treatement. INFO I'm not close with my BIL, my husband is. I don't even talk to him that much and I barely even sat with him at any gathering before he moved in with us.   UPATDATE: So before I provide an update on this situation. It's worth noting that my BIL used to do this with the bedroom too but at least I'm not always exposed in the bedroom. So My husband came home and I told him the lock will not be removed til his brother leaves and his reaction was to try and remove the lock himself and tell me to quit acting childishy. what I did was not shout or scream but pack a bag and go to my mom's house for the next few days or so til this gets resolved somehow. On my way out I saw my BIL in the driveway smoking. He knew what the argument between me and my husband was about but instead of stepping up to fix it he offered to take me to my mom's house saying that my husband could use some space from me. This made me cry the whole uber ride to my mom's house. The reason I feel offended is because BIL tend to be hurtful when he talks about others. I did all I could to win his approval but he thinks less of me and thinks I'm childish just like my husband says.",

Since the cake has always been more for the kids than for my ex, I decided to just make him a small one since it\u2019s not like he eats cake anyway and I don\u2019t want my kids to think I dislike their dad. I told his girlfriend beforehand that I was going to make a small cake and she told me not to and that I couldn\u2019t bring it to the party. I told her I had to bring it to the party as that\u2019s when the kids would give him his gifts. I offered to come early and give it to him before the other guests arrived and then they could put it away and nobody else would know about my cake but she didn\u2019t agree with me and repeatedly told me not to bring it. I did take it with me in the end and now she keeps complaining to mutual friends that I did it on purpose to ruin the party and calling me weird for making him a cake after I was told not to. AITA?",

        "selftext": "This year I went to my fianc\u00e9\u2019s house for Christmas. It was my first time going, as we would typically go to my family\u2019s house instead.  I got a (rather pricey) gift for my fianc\u00e9 \u201cDan\u201d related to his hobbies, I got nice gifts for \u201cDan\u2019s\u201d parents based off of things I\u2019d talked about with them before, and I got a small pack of chocolates for each of Dan\u2019s other relatives (I didn\u2019t know them that well).  I wasn\u2019t expecting many gifts from Dan\u2019s relative\u2019s because I didn\u2019t know many of them that well, but I was certainly expecting more than I got.  At first, I was excited when I saw that there was a big pile of gifts for me. However, once I opened the first one it was just a piece of coal. Everyone laughed, and I just kind of laughed along thinking it was a gag gift and that the other gifts would be different. But every single one turned out to be coal. All 18 of them.  I started to get upset, so I cried and lashed out at Dan. But he calmly explained apparently this is a longstanding tradition in his family where they gift coal to newcomers who are celebrating Christmas with them for the first time. He explained that it\u2019s just easier that way since all the relatives who might not know the newcomer well don\u2019t have to stress over finding a gift, and it\u2019s a fun experience for the newcomer as well.  I told Dan I couldn\u2019t believe I skipped my own family\u2019s celebration for this and left. But now Dan and some of his family are blowing up my phone saying I embarrassed him in front of his relatives and that I made it awkward for everyone. So aita?",

        "selftext": "This happened a while back. My wife and I still talk about it every once in a while. She's on my side and most of our friends and family are. However when it happened it was like WW3 between us and her co-workers and others. Here we go...I've been playing the guitar for 22 years. I know guitar values and whatnot very well. I'm very into the guitar market. At my wife's old company she was hanging out with co-workers one day after work and she mentioned that I play guitar. A co-worker who I guess is very popular at work said that his dad passed away and he was selling his dads things. His dad had a guitar and asked my wife if I'd be interested in it. My wife texted me and I said to have him send me the info on the guitar and the price. The next day he texted me the pics and price. It was a 1952 Telecaster in mint condition. He had the original receipts which was crazy! (That's how I knew the date). I asked what he wanted for it and he said he looked up Telecasters online and he thinks $4,000 is fair. I texted back, I'll take it for $4,000 and went to pick it up. The guitar had no sentimental value to him at all. Here's the issue at hand. The guitar was/is worth approximately $50,000 depending on the buyer and I knew it. When I got the guitar I told my wife the price and what it was worth. She was floored. Fast forward two weeks her co-worker tells my wife he just found out what the guitar was actually worth from a family friend and wanted it back. She said, well he really likes the guitar and he knew it was worth $50,000 which is why he was floored you offered it to him for $4,000. He really likes it and I doubt he will sell it back, but you can ask. (Probably not the smartest thing for her to say, but she was caught off guard and it's not her fault or problem). He contacted me and asked to buy it back. I said that it's not for sale. He then said I scammed him and he was going to sue me and take my wife to HR for being a part of the scam. Which was nuts, but he actually did contact HR. They were cool about it and said it's not their problem. It's between him and me. Over the next few months he made things very uncomfortable for my wife at work. He would bug her constantly about it. She eventually had to go to HR for harassment and they actually let him go (She complained twice and he was warned and didn't stop). He's contacted me several times about it so I got a restraining order for harassment too. I blocked him too. I haven't heard from him in about a year. AITA? UPDATE:  Well this post blew up way beyond what I was expecting. It looks like I was voted Not The Asshole. There's over 5000 comments. I couldn't read them all, but I did read a lot. Just to clear up some things. I left somethings out because I didn't want it to influence opinions and really wanted it to be about me buying a guitar at significantly lower market value vs the people in the story. I did include the fact that the guy was harassing my wife at work not to make the guy sound bad, but because I thought it was relevant to the story. Here's some specific details I chose not to include: The guy and his dad were not close at all. So those people saying he was grieving and I took advantage of him, that is 100% not the case. When I went to get the guitar he was telling me he hadn't talked to his dad in six years and was actually annoyed he had to deal with a funeral. The dad bought the guitar new and never played it. Luckily it was stored in a closet and not in a basement or attic. There's no issue with the wood or electronics. It plays like a dream and I couldn't be happier. I am not selling the guitar to the son or anyone. It will be with me for a long time. I'm in my 30's so maybe in 30 years it will find a new home. I would have MAYBE considered giving the guy more money or giving him one of my guitars to sell on his own, but I decided not to do that after he left a terrible voicemail on my phone the day he found out the real value. He demanded it back like he was entitled to an object he sold fair and square, called me a POS, called my wife a POS and said he would do bad things if I didn't sell him the guitar back. And to those people who say they would have told the guy the real value. That's a load of horse shit. If you went to a garage sale/estate sale and saw an item worth $5000 priced at $50 there's not a snowballs chance in hell you would walk up to the homeowner and tell them they mis-priced it. You'd buy the item and then tell all your friends and family what a great score you got! Don't even kid yourself like you wouldn't do that. I don't feel bad about buying an awesome guitar at a steal of a price. I was curios what others would think and it looks like I'm not the asshole so thank you reddit. I can play the guitar with zero guilt now. Not like I felt guilty before, but now my feelings are justified.",

        "selftext": "  I (F30) have been with my husband Ted (M34) for 4 years and we got married 2 years ago. His family and I haven't really gotten along too well. They're rich and are all about image. I only see them on occasions but that's when the drama is at it's highest rate. Last Christmas Ted & I traveled to spend Xmas with them and it was awkward for some reason. After we went back to the hotel his mom sent me a list of all the things I've done wrong at her house like bringing wrong types of desserts and wearing inappropriate clothes (um I wore a blouse and leather jacket) and not standing up when guests arrived. This year mother inlaw only sent an invitation to Ted to spend xmas with family. He told me his mom didn't invite me because of my last year's negative points and would rather have just him there this year. I was flabbergasted I asked if he was actually considering going after his mom excluded me and he shrugged and said yes because he never spent xmas away from family his entire life and isn't about to break the cycle now. He suggested I go out, invite Regina (my best friend) over or just plan my own celebration and said but nothing too crazy, capeesh?. I was upset but hey! if they don't want me then I shouldn't force it and tried to not feel hurt and offended. Yesterday Ted came home asking if his bags were ready since it was time to go. I said I don't know and he was stunned. he freaked out saying I knew he was going to travel to his hometown and I should've packed his bags like I always do. I admit that packing his bags is what I do but ONLY WHEN WE'RE TRAVELING TOGETHER and I figured since he was traveling on his own then he should pack them himself. He lost it saying I just caused him to be late and ruined all the (flight/hotel/other reservations) arrangements he had just because I was being bitter because I wasn't invited to xmas celebration with his family. We had a heated argument and he said Look, you're really overreacting right now because it's not like I'm going away on a vacation to another country to spend time with some strippers and whatnot though I'm pretty certain you wouldn't be as half pissed and agitated as you are now. I'm just going to spend time with my family and quite frankly, I don't know what it is with you anymore. Then proceeded to call me petty and say I got him in trouble and punished him by not packing his bags for him knowing he was going to travel. He packed his bags in a rush and ended up forgetting most of the gifts he got for his family. He's now not speaking to me. AITA? ETA: I found out that it's not just my mother inlaw but father inlaw and Ted's brothers figured it would be best that I don't attend their xmas and instead go to my own family claiming they were giving me the options to decide and also they claimed they don't want to force me to be with them since we have some tension between us. ETA2: Ted said this is all temprarily until his family and I get used to and adapt with each others.",

She is my only sister's only child. 2 years ago I married a very wealthy man (34M), and because of the pandemic, last Christmas was my first with my in-laws. My MIL gifted me a coat that is worth more than $20k (I saw her wearing it, asked her where she bought it, and she said that it will be my Christmas gift from her). I didn't know how much it was (I knew it was expensive, but I thought maybe $3k at most). I was visiting my sister last January when my niece saw it, she googled the brand and showed me how much it really was. I won't lie, I didn't wear it after that because I was afraid of ruining it. Last week, I wore it while visiting my sister. While I was putting it back on to leave, I felt something go *splat* on my back, then my niece started cackling and the smell of paint hit me. I was so pissed off while she was not apologitic at all. Her mom screamed at her and said she was grounded. Then she said she will pay for the dry cleaning. While I was in my car, still in shock BTW, I got an alert that my niece posted a reel, it was of her *doing a prank* on me, and she said I'm going to hit my aunt's $20k coat with a paint filled balloon to see how she reacts. I saved it on my phone, sent it to her mom and told her that a week's grounding is not enough. She did not reply, but I saw that my niece took it down (it got less than 5 views by then). The next day I found out my coat can not be saved, so I called my sister and told her that her daughter has to pay it back. Well, we got into an argument and she said that they will not be paying it, and if I wanted a new one, I should get my husband to buy it for me. I think that they should pay for it (they can afford to, IMO they should sell my niece's car and pay me back my money).  We did not reach an agreement, so I told her that I will be suing, and reminded her that I have video evidence that her daughter A) did it on purpose for online clout and B) knew exactly how expensive it was. People in my life are not objective at all, I have some calling me an AH, some saying they are the AHs for not buying me a new one, and some so obsessed with the price of the coat that they are calling me an AH for simply owning it and wanting a new one. So AITA? Edit: sorry for not making it clearer, but my coat was bought new, just identical to my MIL's.",

        "selftext": "I own a vape shop. We're a small business, only 12 employees.   One of my employees, Peggy, was supposed to open yesterday. Peggy has recently been promoted to Manager, after 2 solid years of good work as a cashier. I really thought she could handle the responsibility.   So, I wake up, 3 hours after the place should be open, and I have 22 notifications on the store Facebook page. Customers have been trying to come shop, but the store is closed. Employees are showing up to work, but they're locked out.    I call Peggy, and get no response. I text her, same thing. So I go in and open the store. An hour before her shift was supposed to be **over**, she calls me back.   I ask her if she's ok, and she says she needed to take a mental health day and do some self-care. I'm still pretty pissed at this point, but I'm trying to be understanding, as I know how important mental health can be. So I ask her why she didn't call me as soon as she knew she needed the day off. Her response: I didn't have enough spoons in my drawer for that..   Frankly, IDK what that means. But it seems to me like she's saying she cannot be trusted to handle the responsibility of opening the store in the AM.   So I told her that she had two choices:   1) Go back to her old position, with her old pay.   2) I fire her completely.   She's calling me all sorts of -ist now, and says I'm discriminating against her due to her poor mental health and her gender.  None of this would have been a problem if she simply took 2 minutes to call out. I would have got up and opened the store on time. But this no-call/no-show shit is not the way to run a successful business.  I think I might be the AH here, because I **am** taking away her promotion over something she really had no control over.   But at the same time, she really could have called me.   So, reddit, I leave it to you: Am I the asshole? EDIT: I came back from making a sandwich and had 41 messages.

One thing that was hammered into my head from a young age was to always, *always* bring a small gift when visiting anyone's house. It doesn't matter if it's family or friends or that one person you kind of know but don't really like, bringing something is a must. My bf (28m) and I have been dating for almost 4 years now and since we both work from home he suggested we make dinner with his parents a weekly thing since we haven't been able to see each other much for obvious reasons. I love his parents, so obviously I agreed! Every week I made sure to bring something small to show my appreciation for them cooking for us (always using my own money); a small bottle of wine, their favorite dessert, some flowers etc. and they always thanked me for it. This has been going on for a few months and absolutely didn't notice anything out of the ordinary until yesterday when my bf and I were preparing to head over. I'd gotten a cute vase of daffodils since luckily I'd found some in bloom and my bf's mom really loves them, but my bf suddenly got really mad and asked why I kept bringing stuff over every week like his parents were a charity case. Honestly I got super confused and asked him what the problem was and that I've always done this with everyone including his friends since we met. That it was a cultural thing but then he got even madder and told me to stop imposing my culture on everyone and it's weird since I'm white. At that point I didn't feel like going anywhere with him and just gave him the flowers and went for a walk while he drove over to dinner by himself. After he came home he still had the flowers which he gave to me and told me he was sorry but his parents really were super annoyed with me constantly bringing stuff over like they can't take care of themselves, and later on I got a text from his dad asking me to not come over for dinner anymore. Now my bf's giving me the cold shoulder unless I give his parents a huge apology, but I really, truly don't feel like I'm in the wrong for trying to be nice to them. AITA? quick edit: I didn't realize you could edit posts directly but I'm in a hurry to convince him to let me go over to his parent's house. I did post a brief update and faq in my most recent comment.",

        "selftext": "Edit 4: I now own a CPAP machine. This weekend, I (35m) took a sleep test for the first time in my life. My wife (36f), is a skeptic of American medicine and has been upset with how much I use my phone. So to start, we have an 18 month old baby that we take care of, but I wake up groggy and grumpy every day and have been for decades. So when I finally had the chance to take a sleep study, I jumped on it. Now, I got the results back 2 days ago, and it came back positive. Obstructive sleep apnea. I wasn't surprised. What did surprise me was the price of a machine, nearly $900. So I booked an appointment to get the machine. My wife was livid. She told me that it's too much to pay, that I have student loans to pay off, that she's been saving all this money just for me to waste on myself, when she hasn't gotten a good night's sleep in over a year and a half.  She says that since I sleep heavily, I might sleep better than she does. So last night, she was saying all I need to do is Don't be in your phone all the time and you'll sleep better. I was tired of her always thinking she's smarter than doctors so I abruptly said F*ck you. and stormed out of the room. Now it's today. I cancelled the appointment, I'm not expecting anything to get better, she is still not speaking to me, and I'm wondering if I'm wrong here. AITA? Edit 1: to clarify, we have more than a year's income in savings, so at this point we are hoarding money. Also, she told me it was just doctors trying to make money. Also, she told me to my face you wouldn't use it anyway. Lastly, I do use my phone at night, but only to combat existing insomnia. So if I get a good night's rest, I am less likely to overuse coffee to stay alert during the day, breaking the cycle of coffee -> bad night's sleep -> coffee. Edit 2: I'm only 130lbs, so it's clearly not a weight/diabetic issue. We have two beds, one in the master bedroom and one in the basement across the house, so it wouldn't be a noise issue to get one. And I understand I need to be nicer about this. It's not the first time I've sought medical help (she doesn't really believe in psychology or therapy) and she pushes back on every decision, so I admit I snapped and need to work on that. My results were 5.1 stoppages per hour on average, and lowest blood oxygen level was 89% average. Edit 3: I've gone ahead and ordered a machine.",

My husband had me got up although I wasn't finish with dinner but he said we should leave. In the car, he lost it on me asking what brain cell made me think it was a good idea to tell his mom that. I told him his mom kept pushing after I'd already given her an answer. still he said this was the most fucked up shit he heard me say. I replied that I was just frustrated and didn't mean to hurt her feelings and cause issues. he argued that if I don't want issues then I should stop making shit difficult and just say yes to his mom's request. he then ranted about how it's his son too and then said if his mom isn't allowed in there then he won't be there too. now I don't know if he really meant this or just said it in the hear of the moment but it had me fuming. He's been ignoring me when I try to talk to him and act like I'm not in the room. I think I might have gone too far and created tension by responding inappropriately. AITA? EDIT/ there has been some tension between me, my husband, and his family lately this probably blew up because of built up resentment",

        "selftext": "This happened a couple of days before Christmas.  My sister, her 3 kids (4,6,8), and I were all staying at my parents house for the holidays. I have a 1TB iPad Pro (the largest screen model) that I use for my job. I do digital commissions, design band posters, design flyers to make money on the side as I\u2019m in college. I saved up for a year to buy this iPad, it was an investment in my hobby.  I left the iPad plugged up in my fathers study where I was working on some projects the night before. I got up in the morning to find the thing *shattered* in the living room. My sister nonchalantly apologized and said \u201coh sorry the kids broke your screen. Dad says he has a new one he\u2019ll give you to replace it.\u201d  She didn\u2019t even bother to wake me up when she saw that they were broke it. I asked her why she wasn\u2019t watching her fucking kids, and how they got my iPad from my fathers study. She said that she *gave it to them* so they could watch YouTube. I obviously started yelling at her, and asked her how she could be to obtuse as to let her kids play with my stuff without asking. She called me selfish. \u201cThey\u2019re my niece and nephews and I should want to share with them.\u201d Wtf. My dad tried to give me a iPad Air, and tell me that it was the same thing. I told him it was unacceptable and I wanted my iPad replaced *immediately*. He said he didn\u2019t have the money, so I went to my sister and demanded the money. She tried to ask if she could make payments as the cost would wipe out her savings, and I said no way. I wanted the full cost of the iPad, the pencil , AND the $250 that I\u2019m going to miss out on because I couldn\u2019t finish the project I was working on It would be around $2200 dollars.  She tried to call me heartless, and told me to think of my niece and nephew. I told her to go fuck herself, if she was a better mother she\u2019d have more than 2k saved up when she has three kids. My parents think I\u2019m over reacting, but I don\u2019t. She is trying to avoid me and not speak to me, and I told her that I would be suing her then for the full cost of my iPad and lost wages.She\u2019s acting like a total bitch, and crying on social media about how her heartless brother is trying to sue her and break her and her children over an \u201chonest mistake\u201d. I\u2019ve gotten calls from several family members calling me a bad brother, and asking me to reconsider. I can\u2019t believe this is happening. WIBTA for suing my \u201cpoor broke sister\u201d because she can\u2019t watch her fucking kids? TLDR my sisters kids broke my expensive iPad and I\u2019m suing her, AITA?",

        "selftext": "I (19F) am a sophomore in college and have a friend, Tia (18F), who is in high school and applying for colleges and scholarships. I helped her throughout the college process and she ended up getting in early action to her top college, and she got a full scholarship. I was happy for her until recently.  I was talking to a mutual friend of ours and she started gushing about how Tia\u2019s essay was so heartfelt and beautiful. I asked to see it because I thought she had just forgotten to show me (she showed me many of her essay drafts). But as I was reading it, I was completely taken aback. The essay was one of MY college essay drafts which I\u2019d shown to Tia for reference on writing TECHNIQUES ONLY. I made this clear.  I was livid. The essay was really personal, and she barely even tweaked it up. It was almost entirely copied and pasted. I trusted her with it, and this is what she did.  In a fit of rage, I gathered all the evidence of me helping her with the college process, including evidence of me sending the specific essay to her, and I showed it to the school. She not only lost her scholarship, but she also lost her seat in the school.  Now, people are calling me dramatic and shaming me for robbing her of her education. She\u2019s the only person in her family to get into college and receive an academic and athletic scholarship, so everyone was rooting for her, including me at one time. And while I didn\u2019t expect the outcome to be so severe, it was.  Right now, I feel bad. I feel terrible. I feel like she took advantage of me, but I didn\u2019t want to be the cause of something so horrible. I did myself a justice, but at the cost of someone\u2019s dreams. Now I\u2019m wondering if what I did was justified or not.  AITA? ***EDIT*** First of all, thank you to everyone who offered kind words of reassurance and support. I obviously cannot reply to everyone, but I am going through all of these comments! You guys helped me realize that I wasn\u2019t in the wrong. \u2764\ufe0f All the nasty YTA comments, you guys also helped me realize I wasn\u2019t wrong\ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffc. Someone said that they hope all the Tia apologists are worked on my doctors who cheated throughout medical school and have their houses worked on by cheating electricians \ud83d\ude02.  Secondly, I didn\u2019t expect this post to blow up so much lol. I went to bed soon after posting it and thought that I\u2019d wake up to 50-60 replies at most. Somehow, I\u2019m on the front page too! Crazy stuff.",

Basically I grew up in a very repressive culture and family where premarital sex was big taboo especially for girls. It took me a long time to get over that. He knows all this. We were friends for 2 years and then dated for 6 months before we had sex and I told him about all my issues. He was the first guy I trusted enough to sleep with him.  We were using condoms and bc pills and I really don't know what happened. I already felt so guilty because I felt I must have screwed up somehow. We had already discussed previously how neither of us wanted kids right now. I went to talk to him before booking an abortion and the first thing he said was he wants a paternity test because 2 bc methods shouldn't have failed. I was so hurt that he could trust me so little after all the trust I put in him and that he thought I was the kind of person to cheat. Also I kind of started to believe what my mom always said that all guys think that girls who have premarital sex are just easy sluts.  So I told him since he didn't think it was his kid that meant his opinion on how to go forward was irrelevant. I broke up with him right then, even though he started saying that's not what he meant and he just wanted to be sure and then talk aboutwhat to do. I left, blocked him on all social media, got the abortion and never had any contact with him again. We have a lot of mutual friends and they have taken sides. Some think even if he did imply I cheated on him, since the baby was his, he should have had some say.",

Mom left cash on the table for me to pay. It was me, and two boys (7 and 10) large cheese pizza and breadsticks. I have always been under the impression that the babysitter is allowed to have a reasonable amount of dinner if they're expected to serve dinner. I've babysat a few times in the past and have never encountered this. When the parents came home to relieve me they asked how tonight went. I said fine, and said that the pizza place was really good as I had never ordered from there before. Mom looked at me puzzled, and asked why I ate the kids dinner. I said I just had two pieces of pizza and a breadstick. I feel as if this was not an inappropriate amount to eat. However, the parents disagreed. Dad said that they didn't expect to have to feed me dinner as well, and told me not to eat their family's food.  Overall, I am very uncomfortable and confused by this experience. Both boys were fed, and did not complain about being hungry for the rest of the night. I personally have always assumed, perhaps wrongly, that if I am expected to serve dinner as a sitter than I am welcome to have a serving. Is this something anyone else has experienced? AITA?",

        "selftext": "I (F-36) have a daughter (F-16) who loves baking, and she's incredibly good at it. It's her passion since she was 3 and I encourage her to follow it and discover more ways to become better at it. I even enrolled her in few classes in academy to learn more. I met my fiance (M-41) 2 and a half years ago. We're getting married soon. And for the wedding cake I had an idea which's to have my daughter bake the cake and decorate it for us. My daughter agreed and was so excited to do it. My fiance glanced at me when he heard about it then when we were alone he snapped and said I can't believe you're being serious about this I told him why not, it's not like we're having a huge formal wedding with many guests. Just a small party with our family and loved ones. He said this was a fucking joke and that he will not let a child bake our wedding cake while there are tons of professional bakers out there who can make a much more decent looking/tasting one. I said I didn't understand the problem because I thought he loved her baking. He responded I do love what she bakes but let's just stick to the muffins and brownies. I told him he was being unreasonable and that his words were hurtful to me and my daughter and her abilities. He told me to be more realistic and think about what the guests will say. again, I said all the guests are family and friends so I doubt they'd make any negative comments about the cake knowing my daughter made it. Matter of a fact, they might even think it's sweet. He got mad and said that there was nothing sweet about getting embarrassed on *his* wedding day. We argued for over 2 hours just going back and forth on the issue. Later, I got a call from his mother telling me that I should start being rational and look at things from her son's prespective. She suggested we get a professional cake for the wedding then have my daughter maybe bake some cupcakes for the buffett or something. But I wasn't convinced and felt like they're deciding my wedding's plans for me and forcing what they want on me. I don't care how the cake will look but it's the sentiment I care about.",

        "selftext": " My biological (12yo) daughter ~ Susan likes to collect and read old children's books. She's become incredible reader. She had problems with reading and learning before and we were advised to encourage her to read and eversince she started reading (which she does regularly) her skills improved. she also reads to her 2yo sister everynight. I have a (16yo), stepson ~ Levi who can be a hothead sometimes. We don't have a son~dad relationship but I respect him and he respects me though he can act quite mean and selfish towards me and his sisters. He'd throw away stuff that belongs to us over small arguments and teases Susan for spending a lot of time to read calling her grandma. My wife and I discussed his behavior and had conversations and agreed on punishments but Levi'd go to his dad's place whenever he causes troubles then have his dad yell at me for wanting to discuss a suitable punishment. Then Levi comes home days later expecting me to let go of what he did everytime, it's frustrating. I got a call at work from Susan saying Levi took her entire book collection and threw them in the pool after she refused to lend him and his friends her camera for his trip. My wife helped get them out but they were wet and some were torn. It was horrific because some of those books are hard to get and meant a lot to Susan as a part of her life.I was so mad at Levi I came home to have a conversation with my wife to decide on a punishment but he already packed a small bag and went to his dad's, I asked my wife how could she let him basically run after doing this and she said he called his dad and he came to pick him up after Susan said that I was coming home to deal with the problem. I went to his dad's house and he refused to let me see him. I told him how Levi was hiding from consequences and his dad tried to justify why Levi was acting out by blaming me for how me and Susan treat him. He even said he'd get CPS involved if I ever try to punish him because I'm not his dad, I have no right. Adding what Levi did was a reaction to my daughter being mean to him. He told me to leave because Levi won't come home til I promise not to do anything about what he did and put it in writing. I told him Levi should stay there with him then. He's not to come back til ~he~ get proper punishment.His dad argued it's his mom's house too and called my wife and she asked to let this go and we'll figure out some way to resolve it but I don't think it's fair for Susan to have her books ruined and Levi getting away with it. They're asking me to let it go but this will only encourage Levi to do worse if I don't deal with it now.It's been 2 weeks and my in-laws say I was out of line for banning Levi from coming home and are telling me to step back but I refused. EDIT ~ Levi's dad thinks that because I'm not his bio dad then I have no right to punish him for whatever he does in the house. In the past his dad caused issues when I used to take Levi's electronics (that his dad bought) as punishment. Then I got talked out of punishing him everytime he did something unacceptable wether to me or his sisters. I've arranged for family therapy but Levi's dad refused to let him go. EDIT ~ I'd like to mention that my inlaws said that Levi is willing to apologize to Susan and so this should be enough to get this over with but I kept saying no and for that I'm being considered at fault.",

        "selftext": "I'm just going to be direct and quick.  I (M35) have 2 sisters that I'm close with, I also have a niece (Leah), Leah's 16 and after my ex wife decided to split up and divorce due to inferitility problems that lasted for 5 years. I started a college fund for Leah to help her go to her chosen college. That was in 2019  Now I visit my mother's home (where my sister and Leah are living) every week to spend the weekend together.  This past weekend I was asleep upstairs while my mother, my sister and Leah were in the kitchen. I came downstairs to grab a glass of water and heard my sister talking about my ex wife expecting a baby with her new husband. This struck a nerve and I kind of froze from shock. I then heard Leah react to the news repeatedly saying I told you so I told you so then explained she's always thought that I was the one with a problem for not being able to have a baby with my ex, but that I was too afraid to admit due to fragile masculinity. I could not believe what she said but what made it worse is her following statement about how my ex was smart to get a divorce before it was too late. I went upstairs and into the room and shut the door and stayed there for hours.  Mom and sister saw me about to leave and insisted to know what the problem was. I didn't want to argue but I told them that I heard what Leah said about me. Leah stopped eating and got quiet. My sister tried to play dumb but I told her I heard their entire conversation about my ex wife and her pregnancy news. My sister tried to backpaddle saying Leah is just a kid who doesn't know much about this stuff and was just spouting nonesense. I told them I don't wanna talk about it and they refused to let me leave but I left eventually. I later sent my sister a text telling her about how hurt and devastated I was because of what Leah said, and told her I will no longer be responsible for funding her education. My sister kept trying to call then texted saying Leah didn't mean what she said and offered to make her apologize but I didn't feel comfortable being in the same room with someone who, blamed me for something that was out of my control and, something that literally turned my life upside down.  My mother tried to get me to come over so we could talk saying Leah doesn't deseve me turning my back on her like that. ETA So this went off unexpectedly, I read a lot of insightful comments but couldn't keep up (I'm sorry). I haven't seen my sister nor Leah after what happened. but they are still trying to contact me, which means there's still a room for a discussion and so I've decided to go see them tomorrow, sit down together and have a long conversation but this. Now I admit I'm not the type of person that feels comfortable talking about what's bothering me. especially when it comes to sensitive topics, but like some of you have said, this is my family, my niece and her future. I admit that I was mad when I told my sister about the college fund cancelation, I love Leah so much and see her as my own daughter. Unfortunately her dad, my BIL is deceased and so I understand losing a parent at a young age and relate to the kind of hurt she carries inside ( lost my father in an accident when I was 11) And I think that...sitting down and talking things out is the best option before I make any decision. Hopefully this will get resolved soon and I'm so sorry for the long ETA but I just wanted to let you guys know. I might update on what happens after we talk so we'll see how it goes. Thank you so much for bearing with me. Also, one more thing to clarify, both my ex wife and I were having these fertility issues, both sides but since my ex wife got pregnant soon after her new marriage then my family thought that I was the problem originally. It is what it is and I'm learning to not words get in my head so easily. I'm not mad at anyone, I'm just trying to move on with my life like anybody else.",

I also work a physically intense outdoor job so I come home really sweaty and exhausted from the heat. The apartment will stay cool enough for me to fall asleep but then later on I\u2019ll wake up in the middle of the night completely drenched in sweat. I\u2019ll then get up and find out that my roommate has been switching the ac off while I\u2019m sleeping. This really upsets me because it\u2019s been making me really dehydrated and tired to begin with from not sleeping well and it\u2019s been impacting my work. She\u2019s unemployed right now so I thought she might\u2019ve been hung up about the power bill. When I finally talked to her about it I explained that I\u2019m already very sensitive to heat to begin with and that because we\u2019re fortunate enough to have ac I want to enjoy it when I get home especially after a long day at work, and that the heat is causing problems for me. I even offered to foot some of her share of the power bill if she was really that concerned about it. But then she said that she turns it off because the apartment gets too cold (I should add that our AC is set at 70 and has never been moved lower than that).  I told her that she should just use some blankets or put a sweater on if it was really bothering her, because the heat is unbearable. She then countered by saying that because she\u2019s in recovery from anorexia she\u2019s really sensitive to cold and that I\u2019m not prioritizing her needs. I then responded by saying, \u201cI\u2019m sympathetic to your situation, but that is your problem and not mine, and it is starting to have a negative impact on me and we need to find some middle ground here, because I can\u2019t take off my skin when it gets too hot.\u201d She then got extremely upset and angry and told me that I was being ableist and insensitive. I\u2019m kind of bothered by this because I\u2019ve also had struggles with eating disorders in the past. So am I the asshole here? (Additional info from a comment I made so it doesn\u2019t get buried: I see a lot of people making the assumption that I\u2019m completely unwilling to compromise with her or that I\u2019m set on having it at 70. During our talk I offered to adjust the temperature but she wants it COMPLETELY off. Not adjusted. Off all the way. And that was what made me angry.)",

        "selftext": "So, I'm a 28 year old dude and have been living in my house for a few years now. One of the main reasons I chose this place was because my bedroom faced east, allowing me to wake up to the morning sunlight. Most mornings I wake up before my alarm goes off just because the sunlight coming through the window waking me up. There used to be a treeline that provided a natural barrier between my house and any potential neighbors, so I never saw the need for curtains or blinds along with they are expensive as hell for the nice ones. Recently my neighborhood expanded and most of the treeline my bedroom was facing was cut down to build new houses. So boom, then there's a house was built right across from mine, and their window has a clear view into my bedroom. I've always been comfortable sleeping nude, and it wasn't an issue when there were no neighbors around. But not long after the people moved in the father from the house came over to my house and pretty much told me to stop being nude in front of my windows since his family can see inside my bedroom. He wasn't nice about it. But, he wasn't mean either just matter of factly like he gave me an order a fully expected it to be done like I was his kid or his employee. I was somewhat surprised but understood his concern, so I made an effort to be more mindful of my nudity when in view of the window. I stopped cleaning and making my bed before getting dressed. I'd hop out of bed walk into my closet and at least put on shorts then go about my morning chores. That being said, I still sleep nude, and I occasionally end up being visible to the neighbors for a brief moment after waking up. The father came over again, leading to an argument between us. I told him I was trying my best to be considerate, but there's only so much I can do and that it's my house and I'm not changing my lifestyle because they moved in. He threatened to call the police and said I was being a menace to the neighborhood whatever the hell that means. So, am I the asshole for continuing to sleep nude even though my neighbors can see into my bedroom?",

        "selftext": "eta: Nate's family is also really conservative and he was brought up like that as well. Someone mentioned I should have added this in. Also, I'm from the US since a lot of people asked.. This is so so so embarrassing but I can't take it anymore. I have to know if i'm in the wrong here. I need to apologise if so... I (21F) was told by my bf, Nate (26M) that i'd get the house to myself for the weekend. He said he had to go visit his parents to take care of a property related issue. I was pretty excited to have the house to myself because I have been living with Nate since I was 19 and I missed living alone (though Nate is the loml and in no way a trouble to live with) I had this tradition of spending a lot of my weekends baking while in my lingerie (idk it makes me feel pretty. Yes ik it's stupid but it just makes me stupid happy) with music and dancing. Super embarrassing to admit but I also do silly things like pretending i'm a Victoria's model or a singer and I sing along, loudly. I mentioned this because this means the house is usually a mess. My dresses are all over and the music is super loud which is obviously not ok. I hadn't done that in a long time because Nate hates loud music and he's not a fan of my cupcakes. So i decided to do it this weekend. So it's Sunday and I put on 'what a feeling by One Direction' and it's super loud, i'm only wearing lingerie (the Victoria's kind so lacy af. which I regret sm looking back ugh). My bf used his key to open the door and I didn't hear him come in because like i said, it's loud in the house and i'm also in the kitchen/living room area. Apparently he wanted to surprise me... Nate brought his mom, dad, and his sister's two kids (only like 10M think). They come in and there I am, frozen in a dance pose like an idiot. I quickly ran to our room, yelling Sorry, wasn't expecting anyone! and was putting on clothes, when Nate come in. He was so angry. He said i was acting like a child and that I embarrassed him. His parents wanted Nate to drop them back asap, refusing to stay and his mom called me a lot of names and said the kids had seen 'everything' and that made me feel guilty af... Here's why I am losing sleep over this: On one hand, I didn't know they would come. I locked the door too so I feel like I didn't do anything wrong. I planned on cleaning up my mess before Nate came home too. Also, Nate and his mom insulted me a lot. But when you look at it from their perspective, I was behaving like an immature person. The house was a mess, I looked a mess, there were baking supplies scattered. Nate just wanted to surprise me and do something nice. Nate is still not completely talking to me, I don't know how to face his family, and I also know his sister told him to make me behave or smn... So I feel like I should apologise before things get worse but I can't decide for sure if i'm in the wrong here so I need your help. thank you for reading.",

        "selftext": "My daughters 14&16 are on the same dance team. Their team won a competition on Sunday, and we were all so excited and proud of them. After the competition, my dad suggested we go out to eat and said he would pay for wherever we wanted. Older daughter, who loves seafood, has been asking for years to go to a restaurant that has unlimited crab legs, but it's a very pricy restaurant, so we've never been able to. She immediately suggested this restaurant. My dad liked the suggestion. My younger daughter suggested we go to her favorite restaurant, a local Mexican restaurant, instead. We've been there many times, as it's much more affordable. Knowing this would be a wasted opportunity, I said older daughter's suggestion made more sense because it was somewhere we'd never been. Younger daughter complained she wouldn't like anything there, but I assured her the menu would have more than crab legs. We got there, and sure enough, there were many dishes that didn't have seafood, including steak, youngest's favorite. Even though there were dishes without seafood, youngest daughter said she wasn't hungry because the restaurant smelled weird. I ordered her steak anyway. Younger daughter pouted throughout the meal. She picked at her steak. Older daughter was very happy, and completely absorbed in the crab legs. My mom tried to talk to my younger daughter about the competition, but she wasn't responsive. At the end of the meal, we were all stuffed except for youngest. My dad told everyone to pick a dessert to go, except for youngest because she's clearly not hungry. I asked my dad to leave her alone, and he did, but she was already upset. When we got home, I tried to talk to her. I explained that this was a rare opportunity and sometimes we need to let someone else have something nice. I told her I could have taken us to the Mexican restaurant this weekend. She said it's not the same, because the restaurant we go to the night of the competition is special, and we went somewhere she didn't like. I pointed out that she didn't know she didn't like it because she didn't try it. She said I know she hates seafood and that the restaurant is known for its seafood, so of course she wouldn't want to go there after a special event. She was annoyed all Monday and Tuesday but started to mellow on Wednesday. This morning she asked if we are going to the Mexican restaurant tomorrow. I said not this week because of her behavior, but we'll see next week. She wasn't happy. Am I being too hard on her? I think she was very rude to her grandparents, but I know when you're a teenager everything feels like a bigger deal than it is. Should I have just let her behavior slide and taken her to the Mexican restaurant?",

        "selftext": "I 30m and my Husband 33m have a  11-year-old daughter who\u2019s been going through severe bullying at school.  It\u2019s just keep getting worse. It started of with just name calling but has gotten worse over the past few weeks. Context: She\u2019s adopted, which is something we\u2019ve always been open about and celebrated as part of her story. Recently, some kids found out about her adoption and started saying horrible things \u2013 telling her stuff like her birth mother didn\u2019t want her. They tell her that she\u2019s unwanted tell her she a reject. ( which is not the case her mother loved her very much to the point she literally gave her life so she could be here)  If this wasn't bad enough  A few days ago, she came home in tears with her hair butchered  they\u2019d cut off 2 inch of her ponytail well in class all while taunting her names and laughing at her reaction.  They will follow her through the halls to make fun of her on a regular basis now. Both my husband and I have been in touch with the school about the bullying more times than I can count. I emailed, called, even showed up in person to speak with teachers and the principal, but all I got were empty promises that they\u2019d \u201clook into it.\u201d Nothing changed, and my daughter\u2019s mental health has taken a hit  she\u2019s anxious, struggling to sleep, and now begs us not to send her to school. Finally, out of frustration and feeling like no one was taking this seriously, we reached out to a lawyer to explore legal action against both the school and the bully\u2019s family. Only when the school and her parents learned we were considering a legal action did they start to act. Suddenly, the school calls me to say they\u2019re moving the bully out of my daughter\u2019s class and claim they \u201chad a talk\u201d with her. The girl\u2019s parents reached out too, saying they\u2019d \u201ctalk to their daughter\u201d and promised it would stop. But honestly, I don\u2019t believe them. It feels like they're all saying this just to get me to back off and avoid the legal consequences. I worry that once the dust settles, things will go right back to how they were, and my daughter will still be dealing with this. My family thinks I should give the school and parents a chance now that they\u2019re finally taking action, but I feel like it\u2019s all for show. So, AITA for moving forward with legal action even though the school and the bully\u2019s parents now claim they\u2019re handling it? ",

        "selftext": " Tldr at bottom. So to give some context, I (f32) have been married to my husband (m39) for 4 years. I work a full time job while he does a 3 times a week night shift. We have a 2 year old and I'm 6 months pregnant. This whole drama started days ago. My husband has a large family. And on every Christmas they'd gather at his father's house. My father in law passed away a year ago and This year my husband decided as the man of the family to host Christmas at our house. Unbeknowest to me, he sent out invitations for a 5 day Christmas celebration to his entire family which are about 26 members in total.I found out about by accident and I was too shocked to react. I confronted him on it and he said I shouldn't be surprised and just get used to it because after his father's death he's now the family's head and all major family events will be held in our house and in his presence. I freaked out and said no this is wrong and he should've talked to me first before sending out any invitations to his family knowing I have other commitments like work and taking care of the house and our son. He said we'll manage if I took time off work but that means more workload later and it'd take away from my maternity leave. I demanded he cancel the invitations but he refused saying over my dead body then walked out. I ended up sending a mass text to everyone who recieved an invitation explaining that we will not be hosting Christmas this year. He found out and went off on me calling my behabior outragously appalling and said that I  broke his word to his family and made him look small and with no authority. I in a very strict tone replied that I didn't sign up to host a celebration and accomadate 26 people while pregnant, taking care of a toddler and working. And I don't care if he became the head of family after his father's death because it means nothing to me. He took offense to that and walked out almost crying. He later talked about how I disrespected his father and him with what I said and demanded a hand written apology for cancelling the event and for being insensitive towards him and underminning his authority infront of his family but I said no apology from me in any form and the issue is still up especially with my MIL giving me a stern talk about how out of line I was for disrespecting my husband's decisions regarding the holiday celebration with family. tldr: my husband invited his family without telling me so I cancelled and he wants a formal apology. ETA to put this out there he planned on sitting and telling stories of his dad while I handle everything and his family believe that as guests it's rude to ask them to help.",

        "selftext": "New to Reddit as I need opinions.  My fianc\u00e9 and I (both 30s) are getting married in a couple of months. We now need to finalise our menu choices for our guests. Now, we are vegetarian. In general, we are pretty relaxed vegetarians. If we go out, we totally don't mind if our friends/family choose meat or fish to eat, same if we visit family. As long as there is a veggie option, then great. Now back to the wedding. On looking at the choices, and given it's our day, we thought it would be nice to have a fully vegetarian menu. My (32F) parents are paying for the meal and have been absolutely stunned by this choice. They say it's disrepectful to people who aren't in the vegetarian culture, and also disrespectful to our own values in terms of ensuring our friends have a nice time. They say it's forcing our ethics on other people. My viewpoint is: it is one meal only, on our day, where I'm sure it will be delicious whatever they're served. None of our friends have ever complained when coming to our house for (vegetarian) food but my parents say it's different at a wedding because people expect luxury food, especially if they are travelling from abroad (many are) and apparently this needs to include meat. I am honestly Natalie Imbruglia-d (torn) on this. Personally I don't mind that much if our guests eat meat but it is inconsistent with our own life choices and it is our day, so that could make it feel inauthentic. And I think the whole focus on meat thing is quite generational (my parents are in their 60s). My fianc\u00e9 agrees with me but the issue is my parents are (very kindly) paying for the meal.

My mom (43f) came into my room the other day asking me if I want to go and stay somewhere on that Saturday night so she can have her man over to do the deed. I was obviously upset by this and told her I planned on coming home as I wanted to sleep in my own bed. She then persisted that I go and stay with a friend because she didn\u2019t want to have to go out to do whatever (my twin siblings would also be out the house they are 5 and staying with my grandparents). I said it is not my problem that she wants someone to stay over and I will be coming home to sleep. She then told me that she would be loud and make sure to wake me up to hear and made it clear she did not want me home. This could have been a joke but either way that is not normal to say that to your child right? For context I have been hearing my mom have sex with her boyfriends at the time since I was around 10 years old and I had complained multiple times at hearing this. I obviously don\u2019t want to come home and hear my mom having sex but I also want to sleep at home as it is my bed and I too live there. We\u2019ve been going back and forth on this and now I\u2019m going to stay somewhere else but I still feel like she is in the wrong for asking me to leave in the first place. Idk what to think I understand where she is coming from but still? Edit:I feel like I need to clear some things up. First of all no I do not pay rent because simply I cannot afford to. I live in the UK so there is no underage drinking. I cannot simply just move out that is easier said then done and when I got to uni next year I do plan on leaving and my mom also agrees that then will be the best time for me to move. I am still in full time education and have a part time job so let\u2019s not be so harsh on the fact that I still live with my mom. I understand the privilege of living at home rent free but it doesn\u2019t take away from the fact that my own mom wants to get me out the house so she can have sex with someone. Some of you asked about the boyfriend and yes he does have his own home it\u2019s just in another city and I\u2019ve personally never met him. ",

She made absolutely no effort to sound kind when she, in an extremely rude and annoyed tone, told me to stop packing my son such \u201cdisgusting and inappropriate\u201d lunches. I felt absolutely appalled when she said this, as me and the teacher have, up until now, always maintained a very friendly relationship. She added that the lunches I\u2019m packing my son are \u201cvery distracting for the other students and have an unpleasant odor.\u201d I told her that I understand her concerns, as the lunches I pack are definitely not the healthiest, but the lunches are according to my son\u2019s preferences.

It is very important to me what my son enjoys, and I want him to like my lunches.

        "selftext": "I'm (18m) graduating high school at the end of this month. My dad dropped the bomb on me two nights ago that his stepdaughter (14f) has an award ceremony for some competition she entered and won in another state on that same day and that she really wants him to be there. He told me he couldn't possibly make it to both and since his wife and their children together will be going, he needs to be there too. He told me he would make it up to me and we could celebrate another time. I still live with him (not for much longer). My mom died when I was 7 and my dad got married again when I was 11 or 12. It's been a few years anyway. His stepdaughter never knew her bio dad, so my dad has accepted her as his own. And he has prioritized her a lot in the last 5/6 years. It doesn't always show in the most obvious ways but it can be felt. Father/son time was put on an indefinite hiatus and instead dad told me we needed to include her in our time together but he also spent time with just her for father/daughter time. I brought it up to my dad and he told me I wasn't exactly making an effort to be closer to her so he wanted us all to bond and didn't want me to just focus on my relationship with him. He has attended her dance things instead of my basketball games if they're on at the same time. It doesn't matter if mine was known about first, he will still skip my stuff to go to hers. He will take us on family days and whenever he and his wife say kids can choose he picks her choices over mine. He claims it's because they will be the most fun for everyone but really, he even says it afterward, anything his little princess wants. Our refrigerator and our shower broke at the same time. His stepdaughter's birthday was coming up so he took money from my birthday fund to pay for that stuff and so his stepdaughter would definitely get what she wanted (this barbie house thing and a whole fashion set and they were I think dad said $250). He didn't get all the money back by the time my birthday came around so instead he bought me a $30 gift card for Steam when he had promised me a new monitor and keyboard for my computer (that was a gift from my grandparents). When my dad told me he wouldn't be at my graduation to go and support her, I told him there is no making up for that and he can forget about being included in my life going forward. He told me he would make it up to me and I told him I will always come second to his little princess and I'm not going to be okay with that. I told him he's discarded me for the last time. Dad begged me to be reasonable but I walked away. Then I invited both sets of grandparents who agreed to come. His wife told me I could have come with them and I don't need to attend the ceremony but could support my sister. I said her daughter's not my sister and I do not want to support their family anymore and I will be out of their hair soon. She called me selfish and told me I can't deny her daughter a dad.  AITA?",

We\u2019ve talked to her about it and asked her very politely to please be more mindful about it because it is disturbing the rest of us but it\u2019s in one ear and out the other. We tried being more forceful about it saying that if she continues to slam her door there will start to be consequences. Still nothing changes. It all came to a head the other night when she got up to use the bathroom and all 4 of us were woken up by the slamming. I have to be up at 5am for work and I\u2019ve had enough of the broken sleep and came downstairs and knocked on her door. She opened it and said *WHAT?!* with such attitude it took a lot of self control not to start yelling. I told her as calmly as I could that if she slammed that door one more time she was going to come home and find it gone. She proceeded to yell at me to leave her alone and then slammed it 5 times as hard as she could. Well the next day (Friday) she went to school and my husband and I both had the day off so we took the door off the frame and installed a curtain rod with a nice heavy curtain over the door instead. She came home and freaked the fuck out. She said we\u2019re being emotionally abusive and taking away her right to privacy. She sulked all weekend and won\u2019t talk to us now. My mother says I\u2019m the AH because I overreacted but she doesn\u2019t have to deal with the house shaking. I want to add that we completely respect each other\u2019s privacy in our house which is why we hung up a heavy curtain and made sure that we couldn\u2019t see through it or around it. We even put little Velcro pieces on the walls and curtain sides so it stays in place. She still has her physical privacy which she is absolutely entitled to, but can\u2019t slam a piece of fabric. We also have never and still don\u2019t just go into her room unannounced and still knock on the wall to ask permission to enter. We\u2019ve told her we\u2019ll happily put her door back on once she agrees to respect the no slamming rule.  So AITA? Edit to add: 1) The curtain is an industrial type that blocks sound and light 2) The curtain is only meant to be a temporary measure. As soon as she agrees to stop slamming and be respectful of the shared space we will put it right back on. 3) The door isn\u2019t broken or malfunctioning in any way and there is no draft causing it to swing shut.",

        "selftext": "I have been keeping bees as a hobby for six years now. I have 4 hives in my suburbian backyard along with a large garden. My hives are all properly registered and are legal to keep in my town as of right now.  The problem is that my new neighbors have asked me to get rid of my bees. They purchased the house and moved in over the winter and hadn't noticed my girls until this spring.  Apparently their son is highly allergic to bee stings. He has been hospitalized more than once and has to carry an epi pen.  They asked nicely but seemed a little upset when I said I don't think I could do that. They didn't push the issue with me further but I saw a rant on nextdoor that I am sure was written by them. Some time after that some of the bee hating nextdoor people when to our town board and tried to get bee keeping outlawed in our town. Luckily it didn't pass and they had mentioned in the minutes that current bee keepers would have to be grandfathered in if it did (Because of that I am even more wary of giving it up in case they do bring this legislation up again If I have active hives I can keep them) My neighbors and I aren't really on speaking terms now.  AITA For wanting to keep doing my hobby? EDIT: Thank you for your input everyone Since many have suggested this - I DO already have security cameras in place. All around my house and pointing directly at the hives. You cannot access the hives without spending significant amount of time on video. The hives are also behind locked fences.  I just purchased a sign to put on their* gate that says this area is under video surveillance and will be affixing that to their gate ASAP. *by their I mean the bee's gate! EDIT 2:  Sorry to see we couldn't play nice and this thread got locked. Also thanks for the death threats in my DMs LOL But it looks like the overall consensus is NTA. So thanks for helping to put my mind at rest about this. Well, After sleeping on it and spending the morning making a few legal calls... **THE BEES ARE STAYING.** I just can't take the financial blow on this one. I have spent thousands on my yard. It provides a nice side income and I just can't do it.  I have all my legal ducks in a row, with my set up, carrying the proper insurance, and following all the state and local laws. I shouldn't have much to worry about legal issues as long as I keep doing it the way I have been.  I will reach out to my neighbors with an olive branch and some suggestions to keep their kid safe.  Many people have asked how I would feel if something happened to the kid. And sure, I would feel bad about it. It would be tragic. Also me bees have *always* been legally permitted and registered.",

        "selftext": "I 45F, have two kids: 14M and 17F. My son has High Functioning ASD, and honestly most people cannot tell, but it comes out in certain aspects of his relationships such as thinking about others, compassion, etc. My son also eats a lot of food- way more than someone for his age. He is not overweight in any way so the doctors have not considered this a problem. Here comes the problem- for years when we have ordered food, he has neglected to realize that the food we order is for the whole family, not just him. My husband and I have both spoken to him about this multiple times and usually he just gives half-hearted apologies. We are working on this with his therapist, among other issues he has. On Friday, my daughter had work after school so she drove herself there while my son took the bus home. He said he was hungry so I ordered a pizza and told him to save some for his father and sister. I only took a slice. Usually my daughter does not eat much (1-2 slices) and same thing with my husband. That would've left him with 5 slices of a LARGE pizza. About 2 hours later, my daughter comes home and sees the pizza box empty and starts balling. She usually is not one to complain about food and will usually just make her own food but she did not have time to eat before work today and during lunch she was making up a test, so she did not eat since breakfast. I was furious at my son and deducted the money for a new pizza plus a generous tip to the delivery driver from my son's bank account. My son saw and now he is pissed. My daughter thought it was the right thing to do, especially when this is about the 3rd time it had happened to her. My son's reasoning is that he doesn't work so his only sources of income are for his birthday and Christmas, so my daughter should've paid since she has a job. My husband and I both are on board with what I did, but idk, is my son right? AITA?   ***UPDATE: For everyone saying we are underfeeding him, we have tons of food in the house. The fridge is stocked, we have snacks, ingredients etc. My son refuses to learn how to cook, even when we have offered him cooking classes. Even without learning to cook, we have boxed pasta, popcorn, bread, vegetables and fruits, rice etc. all of which require no cooking ability. He simply chose to eat the whole pizza.**",

        "selftext": "My (23F) wedding was back on Saturday December 31st and I'm still getting backlash from this, so I want to know if this was an AH move. In the country I live in it's currently winter, and we get a fair amount of snow so my wedding was a winter themed wedding. The color theme was forest green and gold. My dress was obviously white, and I chose the color of my bridesmaids dresses to be forest green as well. My MOHs dress was black, and everyone was to wear gold accessories.  I have this friend, we'll call her Kat, that I asked to be one of my bridesmaids. When we went dress shopping and I told them the color theme I was going for, Kat immediately expressed that she thought forest green was a bad choice. She said the thinks it's not a flattering color, and thought I should choose something different and more girly. I said no because my wedding was winter themed and I thought the color would go perfect with the theme. She suggested a pink, blue even a red. I said no, but thanks' for your opinion. She found out my MOHs dress was black and asked if she could wear black too? I said no, only my MOH is wearing black.  I paid for all the dresses.  Fast forward to wedding day, everyone's getting their hair and makeup done and Kat show's up 30 minutes late holding a bag that looked like it had a dress inside. I asked her what this was for? She told me it was for later on at the reception if she got uncomfortable and wanted to change after pictures. I was like ok cool. So fast forward we're all dressed and walking down the stairs because the ceremony is beginning in 30 mins and we were going to take some pictures before. Kat is the last person to come down and she's wearing a BLACK DRESS. At the time I was preoccupied taking pictures with my parents, but my MOH came over to me and made me aware of the situation.  I confronted Kat and asked her what was going on. She said she hates her bridesmaid dress, as the color is ugly and makes her look gross so she's wearing black. I told her please go back and change. She refused and started walking away from me. I said I'm going to ask her one more time, and if she doesn't oblige I'm calling security and kicking her out.  She began yelling at me to fuck off, so I called security and asked them to please escort her out. She started making a BIG scene yelling how I'm such a bitch, that I can't force her to wear anything and that I'm a horrible inconsiderate friend.  The wedding went on and it was truly amazing. Ever since the wedding Kat has been blowing up my phone with texts saying some really nasty thing's and asking for the money back she spent on the black dress, since it was a waste and she didn't get to wear it. I had to block her number. Some of my other bridesmaids have been giving me shit saying that it was a little harsh kicking her out and embarrassing her like that. And that maybe I should give her the money back. AITA for kicking her out?",

I'm on okay terms with them but since we've only been married for a short time and I don't see his family much, we still have that barrier that keeps is from being completely comfortable around each other.\rHis family arranged for the vacation last week. I out of curiosity asked if I could come. My husband felt hasitant but I told him it'd be a great opportunities to get to know his family better. He agreed to take me and his family were surprised to see me but still welcomed me.\rOn the 3rd day of the vacation. His dad, mom, brothers and spouses were all sitting at a table outside talking while I was preparing a fruit salad. As I was making my way back I overheard my MIL say ...did she really had nowhere else to spend the weekend?. At first I had no idea who she was talking about so I kept on walking, but stopped once I overheard my husband say l KNOW!!!! And I didn't want to bring her with me but what was I supposed to do?!!! You know how pushy she can get. I instantly figured it was about me. I felt so shaken up to the point where I almost dropped the salad. This whole time I was there I cleaned, cooked, looked after the kids and this is how they think of me? An inconvenience to them?.\rI quietly booked a ticket and went home on the first plane. He called and texted but I didn't respond anything other than let him know I was home. He got back and went off on me saying what I did was disrespectful and juvenile. I told him I overheard the conversation he had with his mom but he said that I was wrong for eavesdropping and that his family will warm up to me on their terms so I should stop pushing to be around that when they don't feel comfortable with it. Basically saying it was my fault for coming along in the first place. He said that going home like made him and his family disappointed and gave them a really bad impression about me. I think that I might have messed this up and someehat ruined it for them as well.",

Fun fact: he drives 2 cars that he adjusted/fixed on his own. We don't live together but we do meet at my place every weekend. He called and asked what we will be doing on friday and I said I wanted to host a GNI since it was my turn. He asked what the heck was a GNI I said a girls night in and he got quiet then asked if I was being series. I was confused as he started talking about how outdated and sooo 1950s those events are and said that I should stop promoting and advocating for those events as they are sooo toxic and flatout reek of misogyny. I was shocked by his long rant but he said that was his honest opinion. I told him regardless I still plan to host the event after he tried talking me out of it and suggested we go out together. He threw a fit after he suggested bringing his guy friends to join us and I refused since this is not how GNIs work!. He called me a sexist and misogynistic for having a girls night in and making it so obvious instead of being ashamed of myself. He said that my mentality will cause me issues in the future especially if I behave like that in a professional work setting. Let me tell you I was BLOWN AWAY by how he got so worked up like that over me just missing my girls and wanting to spend time with them. We argued some more and he hung up on me after I said I will not stop hosting or being part of GNIs nomatter what he says about it. I tried to call and apologize for lashing out later but he sent a text saying he was hurt by how I handled our small disagreement and needs time to process what he just found out about my personality. This hurt me but my friendship and the bond I share with my girlfriends is huge and I don'the want to risk years of friendships by no longer being part of our bonding activities. Aita?

        "selftext": "I moved from Georgia to the Pacific Northwest last year for a dream job after I graduated college. It was a little bit of a culture shock, because I went from being one of many black people around at any given time to often being the only non-white person in a room, let alone black person. There hasn't been a lot of overt racism, but there's been a lot of strange borderline situations that are amusing and race-related but not necessarily racist. For example, every white woman I meet mentions Beyonce to me within the first five minutes. When I was sitting for my driver's license photo the woman taking my picture opened with, 'So... Beyonce.' So the problem in the post title is that I am the only black woman at my office, and I am constantly, constantly being called the wrong name at work, and I'm coming up on my one-year anniversary. My name is Tina, short for Christina. Pronounced just like it looks, very easy name. For some reason, a handful of people at work call me Tiana, Tiara, or Tia, I think assuming that my name has to be more 'black sounding' than it is. I am most often called Tiana, especially by one of the guys on our development team and by the 'big boss' for another team, which I think then confuses their team members back into calling me the wrong name again. The other thing is that apparently another black woman (elderly, not in the same position I'm in) used to work there and I get called her name (Mary) sometimes too. Sometimes people will look at my name plate and ask me, How do you pronounce that? It's Tina! I have tried politely correcting this and I correct it immediately every time. From polite, Just for the record, my name is Tina! to lighthearted, Tina, like Tina Belcher! In e-mails from me that say Tina in a million places, including my e-mail address, I still get, Thanks Tiana! Sooo... I'm considering doing the Twitter approach, where I just respond to coworkers who call me the wrong name with the wrong name. Like: Chuck: Thanks, Tiana Tina: No problem, Chad! Jessica: Hi Tiara! Tina: Good morning, Jennifer! Would I be the asshole if I did this? I know it's passive aggressive, but every form of polite correction hasn't worked, and I feel really disrespected by this, so I may as well have some fun with it. EDIT: I am pretty overwhelmed by the responses so I just want to add a couple of things: A lot of people have suggested that I gently and firmly remind people of my name. That's what I've been doing, and was my first line of defense! A lot of people have suggested I go to HR. This is the kind of nebulous thing HR doesn't really help with, and it isn't as serious as it could be. A lot of people who identify themselves as white have informed me that this isn't race-related. It is. I have been black for 25 years, and I have a lot of firsthand experience with racism, and I can identify it in my own life. It isn't overt racism, like a slur or an assault, but it is still race-related. I feel like a few people are ALMOST getting it. A lot of people are referencing that Key and Peele sketch with the substitute teacher, which is literally a joke about how white people do this to black people, turned on its head! And finally, a few people have asked why I don't use Tina Turner as an example, since she's also a black Tina. First, I thought young-ish white people would be more familiar with Tina Belcher, but I used 'Tina Turner' as an example for our Dean and he then 'affectionately' nicknamed me Tina Turner, which took deprogramming from his EA to get over. EDIT #2: No, I don't have a southern accent. I'm from Atlanta, and black people from Atlanta don't really have an indecipherable country twang. Plus, my 'working in an office' voice is pretty practiced/neutral. More to the point, no accent makes the name 'Tina' sound like 'Tiana' or Tiara No, the people I work with aren't just 'idiots.' As annoying as this is, they are not stupid people. No, I can't wear a 'Hi, my name is' sticker or a nametag. We have a business professional dress code! Yes, I correct them every time. No, it's not because I'm not 'memorable' or a bad employee! Responding to this post saying, 'Okay Shaniqua' or some other racist caricature of a name truly misses the point, as this is already what my coworkers are doing ('Tiana' being the 'Shaniqua' in this instance). Several people have alarmingly said, 'Okay, Trayvon' and invoking the name of a dead black child at the idea of me calling a white guy 'Chad' is VERY WEIRD!",

We had a great time, service was great, and the experience was very enjoyable. It was time for us to pay our bills. All of us paid separate checks.  When we were all getting our credit cards out to pay, I said out loud to everybody just simply as a conversation Make sure to tip our waitress! She was amazing! Don't be that type of person who doesn't tip. Come on, guys! Not going to lie, I gave my boyfriend a blank stare when I said that.  My boyfriend never tips. He is one of those people where he only wants to pay what is on the bill. No more. No less. I have had conversations in the past with him explaining to him on the etiquette of tipping your waitress since they only make $1.37 an hour where we live and they literally rely on tips, but he does not care.  Anyways, back to the restaurant. None of our friends caught I was looking at my boyfriend because they were all focused on grabbing their credit cards and they simply did not know that he is not a tipper. As usual, my boyfriend did not tip the waitress, but myself and everybody else did.  We said good-bye to our friends and went home. My boyfriend and I took the same car home. He brought up the situation to me in the car. He said I knew you were singling me out at the restaurant when you brought up the tipping topic. I saw that look you gave me. I apologized immediately since he did not sound very thrilled based off the tone of his voice.  I expressed my concern, once again, on how I felt about him never tipping. As usual, he tells me how he literally does not care about tipping and never will anytime soon. The topic changed from there.  I've been thinking about this situation all week.

That image, those details are forever engraved on my mind and I'll never forget how I felt that day. This was truly a turning point in my life. My family have always been there for me so I kept close to them. My younger sister is currently engaged and her wedding will be in few months. She's struggling with money so I decided to help her and her fiance and pay the wedding dress. This allowed her to be able to buy her dream wedding gown that costs 7,000 ($). It's a lot for a dress but she literally cried because she wanted it. (This happened few days before we agreed to go buy the dress). We were eating dinner at my parents home and my cousin and aunt were there.  My aunt was asking my sister about the wedding and my sister said that everything was going according to plan and then casually laughed and said let's just hope he won't ran away with a pregnant mistress or something in our wedding day... I was blown away completely. She laughed and aunt laughed too as if this was a joke. She was basically mocking what happened with me in my wedding. It happened so fast I got up and started screaming at her calling her an idiot but my parents asked me to take it easy and she said it was a joke and she didn't think I'd react so intensely. My aunt remained seated and my cousin asked me to calm down and drink some water but I grabbed my stuff and as I was getting ready, I told my sister she was getting 0 dollars for her dream wedding dress then I walked out. I heard louder commotion as I walked and my dad and cousin followed me outside trying to talk but I asked to be left alone. My and dad spoke to saying I was too harsh on my sister over a joke and said that I know this is how she is with her dark sense of humor. They said she's been crying after I decided to back out of helping her and said this'd ruin her wedding. They want me to reconsider my decision since it might damage my relationship with my sister but I refused. Did I overreact? Info: it's my aunt that would usually bring up what happened from time to time and say stuff like if what happened didn't happen you would've had at least 2 kids now or do you know what day it is? your wedding anniversary ! It's harsh but she stopped doing it anymore. Maybe my sister is being influenced by her but still. It hurt the same, and more coming from my own sister.",

I\u2019ve never been good around children and due to my autism looking after myself has been hassle enough so I know that I\u2019d make an awful parent / guardian, especially when it comes to the emotional side of things. Ever since the accident I have been looking after my nephew and without exaggeration it has been absolutely draining on me. My entire life and my routine has been derailed because of this, which I know isn\u2019t my nephews fault, but it\u2019s been putting under an amount of stress that I can\u2019t handle. The problem is that aside from myself there is no one in our family who is able to take care of him. My parents are elderly and in their late 70s so they can\u2019t look after him. Custody hasn\u2019t been fully sorted out yet and if I was to decline my nephew would be placed into the foster system. I know it isn\u2019t great or the best outcome for him but I\u2019m dedicating to giving him over to them. They\u2019ll be able to find people who can better care for him and who want to care for him (as bad as that sounds). I haven\u2019t told him my decision yet but I have made my parents and friends aware and, well, their reaction has been worse than I expected. Obviously I didn\u2019t think they they would be okay with it but my parents are threatening to end communication with me and a lot of my friends are telling me that if I go through with this that they\u2019ll distance themselves from me. Obviously I\u2019m aware that my nephew wants to stay with family and that he could suffer from going into the foster system - but I can\u2019t take care of him in the way he needs. I can\u2019t afford to take on the cost of getting a bigger apartment with a room for him, let alone bring him up or take care of him. I think it\u2019s best that others do it, they\u2019ll do a better job than I can. But, still, people are calling me heartless and are making out that I\u2019m some monster for this. So am I the asshole? Update: Hello everyone. It\u2019s big a pretty stressful day and I haven\u2019t been able to read through the mountain of comments people have left but I am trying.  After reading what people have said about foster care I am looking into other options. I still don\u2019t think that I\u2019m good enough to be responsible for him but if worst comes to worst I\u2019ll have to do that. I\u2019d much rather take on the stress than hand him over to a system that is likely to take advantage of him and abuse him. That said I have spoken to his best friends parents today about the possibility of taking him in and they did seem to be willing to do it as far as I could tell, we\u2019re just going to talk about more of the particulars about it before deciding on anything. I want to thank everyone who have left productive comments that have given advice for me as well as those kind enough to offer themselves as potential carers for him. Given what everyone has said about this I have changed my mind about foster care but I still do think that I won\u2019t be able to care for him in the way he deserves but I am willing to do it if no other option presents itself.",

        "selftext": "I (23F) was raised by my older half sister (32F). I never met my dad and our mom OD'd when I was 10 and my sister was 19. My sister's dad was still in her life and was willing to support her, but not me. My sister chose to be my guardian and her father's family went low-contact with her as a result. In order to raise me she gave up a lot; her relationship with her father, college, her 20s, and so much more. A few months ago I got engaged and I told my sister that in addition to being my maid of honor, I also wanted her to be the one to walk me down the aisle. All my life she's had to fulfill so many roles for me -- big sister, mother, father, friend -- that it only felt right that those multiple roles be honored on one of the biggest days of my life. My sister was ecstatic and so was I, but when I brought it up with my fiance he objected. My future in-laws are very traditional and my fiance had always expected that his wedding would be a very traditional white wedding. He said that it was great that my sister was my MOH, but that her having two roles wasn't and that it wasn't appropriate for her to walk me down the aisle since that's usually done by a man. Apparently, his family had assumed that my future father-in-law would be the one to give me away since I don't have any male relatives. I told him that I appreciate his father being willing to fill that role, but that the one who make me the person I am is my sister and so it's right that she be the one to give me away. It turned into an argument that's spread to my in-laws. My MIL called me a few days ago to say that although she understand how important my sister is to me, that it's also my fiance's wedding and I shouldn't be putting my sister before him on his day. I definately heard her on that, but this is still important to me. At this point, my sister has even said that she doesn't mind just being the MOH and that she doesn't want to turn my happy day into something stressful. So now it's just me holding out and being stubborn, but I really don't want to concede on this point. Am I being the AH? **EDIT**    I did not expect this to blow up like this and haven't been able to read through all of your verdicts and comments yet, but I wanted to clarify on some of the inquiries which I've seen repeated so far.  **Are the in-laws contributing to the wedding?**  Yes. In fact, they're paying for about 75% of it since I'm in still in school and don't have the money to put towards a wedding the scale that fiance wanted.  **Does your fiance have sisters?**  No; he has two younger brothers. **Did he ask your sister for your hand?**  He did, actually. She also helped him custom design the engagement ring. She showed me their group text and at one point they spent three weeks trying to decide between five different diamonds. Maybe I should just propose with an infinity gauntlet.  It was very sweet and cute.  **What about when you have children/Have you talked about children?**  Because of a medical condition, I am infertile, though neither of us feel a particular strong urge to be parents anyway. But we also know we're still young and that may change, but even if it does it would be very far in the future. I know all to well that things happen, people leave or fall down or die and so even if we got to the point of wanting to adopt it would have to be when I'm financial stable enough that even alone I'd be able to support and care for a child without it being major blow to my or the child's quality of life.  **Could you walk down the aisle by yourself?**  That was my sister's suggestions when she said she was fine just being the MOH, but I rejected it. Because of her, I never walked alone on the worst days of my life so I'm definately not going to walk alone on the happiest.  **Your sister is amazing!**  She is, as far as I'm concerned, the definition of strength and love and I am collecting all of the kind kind things you all have said to show her because she doesn't realize how amazing she is and it's a gd crime.  **Please update us**  I absolutely will. You've all given me a lot to think about, including underlying motivations and larger implications. I'm going to be taking a few days to sit with that and with myself and my feelings, but I promise to make an update about how I've decided to move forward. ",

It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family.  My ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf.  She was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board.  Long story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?",

That\u2019s fine with me. His mother is a woman who I make the effort to be civil with but don\u2019t like. I am much younger than she and my husband are, and come from a more privileged background; she had a lot of things to say about that. She called me her ex\u2019s cash cow and that\u2019s one of the better things she said about me. We are not friends and I won\u2019t even describe her as nice to me. When my husband told her that we will buy my stepson a car for his birthday, she said she wants to chip in 5% of the cost and then we could tell my stepson that the gift is from all of his parents and step parents.  I don\u2019t want to do that. I don\u2019t need her 5% and my stepson knows that his mom and step dad are not in a position to equally share the cost of buying the car. I don\u2019t want recognition for paying 70% of his gift\u2019s cost but I don\u2019t want to share my and my husband\u2019s gift to my stepson with a woman who has always been antagonistic to me. I don\u2019t know why she wants us to gift the car jointly now because we\u2019ve never given my stepson a gift jointly before. And I don\u2019t understand what\u2019s so bad about getting separate gifts from me and his dad, and his mom and his stepdad. I know that many people will say that it\u2019s better for my stepson to see that all his parents and step parents are getting along. I\u2019m civil to his mom and I never talk negatively about her to him. Is that not enough? Am I incapable of being a good step mother to him if I\u2019m not best friends with his mom?

        "selftext": "My F,33 sister F,36 passed away a month ago because of cancer. It's devastating and words can't express how we feel. Her husband struggled to pay off debts and has asked me and my husband to take him and my nieces age, 13 & 16 in for some time. I have to say that I'm not on good terms with him. We've had more than our fair share of disagreements in the past. He tried to sue me and my husband for my own mother's house which I'm living in with my husband and daughter. but he claimed he needed money to pay for my sister's treatment and, this was the only way to get it after we (my brother and I) refused yo help. It's a long story but we're not on good terms. I agreed to only take my nieces in but not him. He tried to negotiate this saying his daughters are grieving and need him, their remaining parent to be around. I said he could see them during visits and that was it. My husband agreed with me at first. my brother inlaw showed up with my nieces days ago and I only let the girls in but turned him away after he tried to talk me into letting him stay. We had a huge argument and the girls went inside crying after their dad left repeatedly saying the want him. My husband is backing out of this saying we might be making a mistake seperating the girls from their dad when they're grieving. My aunt berated me saying I messed up entirely here. I argued that it's my home and I fon't feel comfortable with him staying after what he's done. She called me selfish and bitter and said I'm making it more difficult for the girls who just lost their mom. Now the girls are quiet but my 16yo niece keeps arguing about wanting her dad with them. My husband still thinks we're making a mistake and getting the girls to resent me to what I did to their dad who's grieving.",

        "selftext": "**EDIT** PLEASE STOP SENDING ME CHAT MESSAGES I cannot keep up with ALL of the stuff I'm seeing. **YES EVEN IF YOU'RE ABOUT TO SAY I KNOW YOU SAID DON'T MESSAGE ME BUT...** Years ago I got really into houseplants and started to collect them. Over the years Ive had up to 70, but whittled my collection down to about 35, just the ones I really love. My niece Jenny (14F) has developed an interest in plants and will come over and we will talk about them and she helps with propagation and repotting.  I had to go out of town for two weeks to take care of some work stuff so I asked SIL and Jenny if they could plant sit for me. I told Jenny I would pay but also give her a few cuttings as a trade off. They agreed and when they came over I gave a tour and explained the care needed, and also showed off a few prized plants. SIL asked how much a few of them ran me and I did share. This didn't seem weird bc the family knows and Ive gotten some plants as gifts. Well I returned from my trip and was horrified. They watered and gave the right amount of light, but they also decided to give a lot of my plants haircuts. Big ones. My prized cebu blue pothos mother plant was destroyed. The climbing one too. My manjula pothos had been done the same. My golden that I trained up my stairwell. My string of pearls, hearts, and ruby necklace all destroyed. My silver stripe philodendron. The worst was that my pink princess philo had been reduced to two leaves. And my albo monstera is down to three. I don't even think they got nodes necessarily. These plants are expensive and prized.  I basically broke down and when they came to meet me to give back my key I screamed and screamed at them. Jenny started crying saying I said I would give her cuttings so she thought it was okay. I screamed at her to go home and get what she stole from me and bring it back NOW because SHE KNEW I DIDN'T MEAN SHE COULD DESTROY MY FUCKING PLANTS SIL got between us and said what's done is done **im sorry i don't know why my one edit is gone!! AHHH and half the original post. please read my comments!!** I said no way, you're returning EVERYTHINGJenny said Mom already sold most of them on marketplaceI lost it and just screamed and screamed at them until Jenny was crying and her mom got in my face and told me I was having a tantrum over plants. I told her to get the fuck out of my house and don't EVER come anywhere near me or my home again. I called my brother (SIL husband) and he was shocked and said they told him I said it was all okay.He brought me the stuff she hadn't sold yet and apologized. I told him I never ever want either of them in the same room as me again, they're horrible, AWFUL, irredeemable people and that I hope they both burn in hell where they belong. He told me he gets that I'm upset but that I'm taking it too far and that family means not holding grudges.I told him to leave, and I cried for the rest of the day. I am posting because I need to know if my edict is over the top and if I'm overreacting.So AITA for telling them that they are NO LONGER WELCOME in my home and not even wanting them in the SAME ROOM?",

        "selftext": "I (25F) am getting married. My fianc\u00e9(25 M) and I decided on a dry wedding since we do not drink and see no point in spending money for alcohol. We were debating about getting a cash bar but then decided to no alcohol at all. (There will be a wide range of other drinks, not just juice and soda, provided).  We informed our guests via invitations with something along the lines of \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be worried about choosing a driver or paying a taxi, since everybody will be able to drive\u201d So a friend (26M) called me and asked if I was joking about the dry wedding. I denied it. He asked two times more and I still denied joking. Then he asked what was wrong with me and how is supposed to have fun without alcohol and how he should function that night. And that it was not alright to chose a dry wedding.  This is where I might have been the AH:  I told him that I was not obligated to provide alcohol to him just because he is not able to have fun without it. And that, if he needs alcohol so badly and cannot function without it for even one night with people he knew, that he might be having an alcohol problem and should consider a therapy to treat it.  He flipped out on me and I took his invitation back until he apologises because he used many slurs on me.  Our friends are divided about me being the asshole. Some say I was right, other says I was not right. So Reddit: AITA Someone said to edit this in, so I do: 1. Cash bar - we debated about but decided against it, since we would have to pay a fee for them to open a cash bar and we don\u2019t want to pay for alcohol.  2. Events other then the wedding: we host dinners/party\u2019s/events regularly for our friends and never provided alcohol. So to all people that know us, it is known that we were never ones to provide alcohol. The ones who wanted would bring a beer or two for themselves to a garden party but most of them just drank what we had available. Edit 2: I am seriously shocked about the \u201eI hate weddings so I drink at them\u201c comments. If you despise weddings why come to hammer yourself instead of staying away? No one forced you to come If you hate weddings so much. Edit 3: 1. I am still amazed how many people need alcohol for social gatherings and say \u201cthey need it to function and have fun because it\u2019s boring without\u201d - I still firmly believe that this is not healthy. 2. thank you for the info that less people will come to the wedding, but don\u2019t be afraid: 71 of 75 people are coming. A couple declined because their grandma has her 100 birthday that day. (Happy birthday in advance)3. I see that Reddit is also decided if I am an AH or not, so I take that but thank you for most respectful conversations and discussions :)",

He's a good heart and is normally rational but his one issue is that he expects to accompany me in every ocassion nomatter how big or small. He even went with me to my ex boyfriend's funeral after days of begging.  Now my best friend got married few days ago, it was very small and only close family and friends were invited, My boyfriend couldn't come because of the + one rule. He pitched a hissy fit saying my best friend has no respect for my relationship and was shocked when he learned that I was still going to attend, He told me that if he can't go then I'm expected to not go as well but that is my best friend and I had to respect her rules. He gave me an altimatum either we go together or I stay home with him. I ended up going cause again I respected my friend's rules. He was angry with me and kept calling the entire 2hr drive then stopped. Later I got a text from his friend telling me he (my boyfriend) got into an accident and was taken to the hospital. I freaked out he gave me the address and I had to leave the wedding and told my friends why.  I was a crying the entire drive home and kept calling his friend but got no response. I arrived to the hospital and asked about my boyfriend and they checked and told me he wasn't there, My anxiety reached 160% as I kept calling his friends one by one. I just went home and there he was...along with his friend. He saw me and said that he was sorry but this was the only he can get me home after I left him alone. After the initial shock I just blew up yelling at him about lying and making me leave my friend's wedding and having me literally go to the hospital and freaking out cause of him. I kicked his friend out and we got into an argument. He kept talking about how much I love him thus I left which is my own doing not his and he was just trying to see if I really chose my friend's wedding over him. He then argued that my friend caused this and I shouldn't agree with her to exclude him, I said what he did was horrible and called him horrible and then went to my room. It was awful cause my friends kept calling to check in on him cause they thought he was really at the hospital. He said I overreacted and that I yelled at the wrong person. AITA? Did I go too far? *Info based on request from a user:_ He has a history of mental health issues but got better the past few months. He also had a recent death in his family which really affected his health generally*",

I have never had feelings for Tom nor has he ever had feelings for me. Since college, Tom has been a huge watch fanatic. Two months ago, he was showing me this stunning vintage watch and made an off-handed comment about how he would die of joy if he somehow got his hands on one. Very coincidentally, I was in NYC a few weeks ago and stumbled upon this watch store that just so happened to have the exact one Tom wanted. It was expensive, I wont lie, at about $2,500, but I decided to get it for his 25th birthday (to me, it was basically fate lol). My boyfriend and I do very well financially so this was something that I could personally afford and wanted to buy for Tom, especially knowing how happy it'd make him. Tom has a tradition of hosting a dinner party at his place for his birthday and then following that up with cake and gift opening. I told him before the dinner that my gift was a huge surprise and asked if he could save it for last and he agreed. His girlfriend ends up going first and she gets him this gorgeous sweater that she crocheted for him and a book that he's been wanting, which I thought was super thoughtful and lovely. Last, it was my gift. When he opened it and saw what it was he literally screamed, hopped over a bunch of people, and squeezed me in this huge bear hug. I was SO happy to see him happy, it genuinely filled me with so much joy. He even got emotional and I saw him swipe a few tears. He also said that it was the best gift he'd ever received. The whole time, his girlfriend was only slightly smiling and stayed quiet. The next morning, I get a text from his girlfriend that essentially said that although she appreciated my thoughtful gift, she thought that it was a bit out of touch and lacking awareness. She admitted that Tom had also told her about the watch and she wanted to get it for him, but it was way out of her budget. She accused me of knowing this (I had NO idea) and still getting it to rub it in her face and to outshine her. She finished by saying how she felt like I had overstepped a boundary by getting the gift and would appreciate me not doing anything similar to it again in the future. I responded and told her that while I could see her POV, I was just trying to do a nice thing for a close friend of mine. I asked her, wouldn't you rather he gotten the gift and seen the happiness that it brought him than him not getting it at all? She responded that that happiness was only shared between [me] and Tom and no one else and that she felt hurt by my actions. Only my boyfriend knows about this and he's on my side. But thinking through it all again, I do see how I could've overstepped, but my boyfriend says that it's not my job to apologize for her insecurities. So AITA here?",

        "selftext": "As my title suggests, my mom is a huge Harry Potter nut. She and my dad actually met in a harry potter \u201cIRC\u201d (like Disord but for old people) in the early 00s got married had kids and from day one decided to embarrass us for life by naming us after some Harry Potter and Star Wars characters. It\u2019s honestly been hell. I have a stupid name and since we were little my parents have forced stuff like Harry Potter, Star Wars, marvel movies, etc etc down our throats. Everything is about dragons and magic and blah blah blah. I\u2019m so sick of it. Every birthday every holiday everything is just organized around \u201cfandom.\u201d So just like every Christmas the days leading up to Christmas we have to sit down every night and watch Harry Potter movies. It\u2019s. So. Fucking. BORING!!!! I can usually get away with knitting or drawing on my Ipad during this but this year my mom was like \u201clet\u2019s just have a technology and distraction free night every night\u201d I arranged to go over to my friend Missy\u2019s house instead for like two nights. Missy\u2019s family is NORMAL and likes things a NORMAL amount. My mom got really mad and started talking about how it\u2019s a family tradition and how I\u2019m basically rejecting her and went on her whole thing about how \u201cyou wouldn\u2019t exist if it wasn\u2019t for harry potter.\u201d I finally had it and just yelled \u201cNOBODY CARES THAT YOU WERE A BIG NAME IN THE HARRY POTTER FAN CLUB!!! I don\u2019t like Harry Potter! I don\u2019t like Star Wars! I HATE MARVEL MOVIES THEY\u2019RE ALL SO BORING PLEASE JUST LET ME HAVE MY OWN INTERESTS!\u201d I couldn\u2019t help it I started crying because I was just so frustrated because everything always has to be about harry potter this star wars that and now that we\u2019re all older they started doing game of thrones. EVERYTHING is centered around some kind of movie or tv show or book series.  Just onces I want my family to band around something that DOESN\u2019T have to do with media or these nerdy things. We live in Utah where we have like 5 National Parks and even though I ask every year for my birthday I\u2019VE NEVER EVEN BEEN TO ARCHES!!!!  Well my sister called me saying that mom was angry and to just come home and to stop with the theatrics. I told her that I\u2019m sick of having all this old \u201cnerd\u201d stuff crammed down my throat and just once I want to have a normal time watching normal Christmas movies and not having to pause for \u201clightsabre battles\u201d.\u201d AITA?!??! **HEY GUYS** I know you think you're cool and in on the joke wink wink when you DM me and ask me for my name, but I'm a teenage girl and that's not really how it's coming across. Please stop DMing me I don't care. **for those of you telling me in dms IRC didn't do fandom it was part of a livejournal community. Someone in the community had a fan site they all liked. It had a chatroom. I'm sure there was other stuff too?",

        "selftext": "So my daughter recently turned seven, and for our \u201cfamily part\u201d she asked for a penutbutter and chocolate cake. I agreed.  I let my sister know not to bring my nephew (3) because of his allergy. (It\u2019s so bad that he can\u2019t even be near/breathe in peanutbutter particles).  She asked if I would change the cake to be just chocolate so that my nephew could come. I said no, that it was my daughter\u2019s cake and she can have peanutbutter if she wants. She called me unreasonable because my daughter could have had peanutbutter cake with her \u2018friend party\u2019 (she didn\u2019t have cake with her friends, she just had pizza). She said that my daughter needs to learn to compromise for the sake of family. I told her that I would talk to my daughter, but not to expect a seven year old to choose her baby cousin over her favorite cake.  My conversation with my daughter played out just like I predicted, and when I told my sister, she called my daughter selfish and ungrateful. She said that I\u2019m a bad parent because I \u201ctaught her to hate (nephew)\u201d. She threatened that if my nephew wasn\u2019t welcome, that neither she nor her husband would come either. I said that was fine, because she wasn\u2019t welcome either.  I then reached out to my BIL to let him know what was going on and to tell him he was still welcome if he wanted to come. He thanked me, but said that he would stay home to support my sister.  Her party came and went, and my sister is still being very distant and cold. This has me wondering if I was too harsh to her and my nephew, or too soft on my daughter. AITA?",

        "selftext": "I (27f) have chosen to walk down the aisle alone on my wedding day. The decision was made for two reasons. My dad died when I was 7 and he would be my number one choice if he were alive but he's not and two, my mom has made it perfectly clear that she would find it disrespectful to my stepdad if she walked me down the aisle and so would not do it. Given that both my parents are out and I don't want to ask my paternal grandparents to do too much, my grandma and I are already sharing a special dance, walking alone is what I feel the most comfortable doing. I could ask my stepdad and even when I contemplated my decision, I knew he would want to do it. But it would make me sad to have him walk me instead of my dad if I'm honest. I think my stepdad is a good man and he has tried his very best to be a dad for me. But I didn't want a dad when I lost mine. I wanted my dad. Nobody else was ever going to be able to fill that role in my heart. I asked my mom and stepdad if they would like to do a joint toast or two separate ones and whether they would like to walk down the aisle/dance to specific songs. While discussing this my stepdad asked who I would be walking with and I told him I was walking alone. He offered to do it and I said it was a lovely offer but I would walk alone. He pressed me on why and I said it felt like the best option. He said it would mean the world to him if he could do it, if just once he could feel like he's a real dad and not just second place to my dad. I told him I understood but it was not an option on the table. He said he was already being shamed by having to watch me dance with my grandma when it should be a father/daughter dance. But to have everyone watch me walk alone when they know I have a stepdad is going to send a very big message.  I know people will ask about details on our relationship, etc. I met my stepdad when I was 9 and he married my mom when I was 10. He offered to adopt me and give me his last name and I turned him down five times in the 8 years I lived with them. He was married before my mom and he lost his wife and unborn baby in an accident. He was also made sterile by the same accident. He always longed to be a dad. We got along well but our relationship was always more to him than it was to me. Where he sees a daughter and wants a daughter, I see a good man and someone who is a great spouse to my mom and is good to me, but does not fill the father role he wants to emotionally for me. Physically, he did. But emotionally I never felt like he was my dad and everyone in our lives is aware that I feel as though I have one dad and my stepdad is my stepdad. My mom and stepdad are not paying or contributing to the wedding in any way. My fianc\u00e9 and I both have savings and we're putting those into the wedding. Though our wedding will be smallish since we want to prioritize other things. My mom and stepdad say I am rude and heartless for turning down the offer. AITA?",

        "selftext": "So for the past month, my (36) husband (39) has waking up at 5 every night to have a walk. These walks would take about 2 hours, Side note to mention that this new, he's not trying to lose weight (pretty thin) he's not athletic by nature nor has sports interests or hobbies. infact, he hated doing any type of sport. I'm happy for him since it's an overall positive thing. but yesterday, he came home in the evening after working for long hours then stayed up late playing with his phone. I went to bed at 10 after getting done with the mess and everything. I woke up by him yelling at me at 7 am asking me why I didn't wake him up for his 5am walk. He said he missed it and I'm responsible for that. I was so confused I said that first of all, he always wakes up by setting his alarm, why should I be expected to wake him up this time. He yelled that he forgot to set his alarm. I said so what? it's no big deal it's not like....he missed an important meaning or something but he got more angry and said that those walks help imrove his health and restore his energy and help him feel better. I made a comment about how missing one walk won't hurt but he unloaded on yelling about how I was trying to prevent him for doing his hobby for some unknown reason. I told him he was sorely mistaken even though I admit that those daily 5am walks around the veteran's park are weird but also his reaction? I really thought it was over the top. He stormed off and went to shower saying I ruined his entire day. When he got out he started avoiding and ignoring me. Even when I talk to him directly. he went to work and refused to respond to my calls. Really, I'm at a loss like maybe it was something I said about his walks. but I really don't know. he's sulking nonstop as of now and I'm literally about to lose my mind. AITA?",

Because I know sh*t happens and if anything goes wrong, or not exactly how we wanted, it's not that big of a deal and may even make the wedding more memorable for the guests.  The one thing that I told my husband I didn't want to happen was I didn't want him smashing cake in my face.  I had a suspicion that he would find it funny to do it, so during the planning, I flat out told him not to do it.  I don't think it's funny, I don't want to mess up my makeup that took hours to apply, and I don't want cake on my expensive wedding dress.  I told him I would be livid if he did it.  He promised that he wouldn't. Well, come the cake cutting time, what did he do?  Smashed the cake in my face!  It got on my dress, and messed up my makeup, just like I knew it would.  I'm pretty sure his friends convinced him to do it, not that that makes it any better.  I kept it together, went and cleaned myself up, and put on a smile for the rest of the reception.  But afterwards, I let loose on him.  I yelled at him that this was the ONE THING I asked him not to do, and he promised that he wouldn't.  He told me I was being dramatic, that it's not a big deal, and we should just be enjoying our time as newlyweds.  So was I being overly dramatic?  AITA?",

        "selftext": "Background: My (40sf) husband (40sm) and I bought a 3-bedroom house a few years ago, shortly before the panini. We of course took the master bedroom, and the other two bedrooms went to our children (then 12f and 10m). We put a very nice double bed in the larger room, and a single bed in the smaller room, and told them both that they could choose their rooms, but whoever ended up in the larger room may be asked to share or relocate for visiting family members, while whoever ended up in the smaller room would have it to themself always.  We almost never have family over (hubby and I are both only children, and our parents are in other provinces), so we were surprised when our older daughter chose the smaller room, and our younger son chose the larger room. But ok, they worked it out between themselves, both seemed happy with the choice, so ok. And it has remained that way for a couple of years.  Now, we have a 4-day weekend coming up (my kids are now 15f and 12m), and my mother decided to come down to visit. Of course, we told her ok (my husband and I), as we hadn't seen each other in awhile, and I told our son (with the larger room and bed) that grandma would be here for a few days, and would be using his bed.  Well, my son threw a fit. He didn't want to share a room with grandma, not even on an air mattress, not even for 3 nights, she smells funny. So we reminded him of the original deal, and offered to put the air mattress in the living room, but that wasn't enough, he'd have no privacy there. His sister offered to let him put the air mattress in her room (which she wasn't required to do), and that wasn't ok either. My husband and I offered to let him put the air mattress in our room, and he said no to that (because sharing a room with your parents, yugh! god bless the privilege, but whatever).  Finally, I put my foot down and said, the condition of you having the bigger room was that you'd give it up for visiting family members. So one way or another, you're sleeping on an air mattress for 3 nights. You can choose if the air mattress goes in your room or our room or the living room, or literally any room in this house, but you are sleeping on an air mattress while grandma is here.  Shortly after that confrontation, my husband came to me and suggested that we encourage my mom to stay in a hotel. I asked him who was going to pay for that hotel, since she can't afford it, we can't afford to put her up, and he went silent. Now he's calling me TA for forcing our son to give up his room for all of three nights, and suggesting that I tell my mom not to come at all since apparently none of us can afford it. Edit: I sincerely appreciate everyone's comments and judgements, but I have officially reached the point where every time I look at my notifications, it adds 2 every second without me even having to hit refresh. Clearly I should've posted this on my main account, since apparently reddit karma is important in some way. Lol. To follow the common AITA trend and respond to some common themes: 1. Why don't I offer my own (and my husband's) bed to my mom? My husband has back problems, so also cannot viably sleep on an air mattress. I will not be going into detail on this. I also assume that it will be incredibly obvious to everyone why it is not viable for my husband and my mother to sleep in a bed together while I sleep on an air mattress. Not to mention that she would never allow me to give up my bed for her as a visitor.  2. Why doesn't my mom sleep on the couch/air mattress?  She's 83 years old. Need I say more?  3. Anything involving my son and daughter switching rooms. My daughter is willing to help in the short term, but she seems a bit smug right now about the overall room choice, so she has no desire to switch rooms. And I will not force her, because what kind of parent would I be if I hold my son to the letter of his deal, but go back on my word to my daughter? You may decide I'm TA, and I'll accept that, but I am not a hypocrite.  4. I am fully aware of the privacy a 12yo boy requires, we've had that conversation, and (at the prompting of a couple commenters), I have also recently asked my husband if there was a private conversation between him and my son that would in some way change this situation. He said no. Since I do not currently have any reason to believe my husband would lie to me outright, I'm considering that conversation closed. 5. Rip my dms, apparently? Lol, I didn't know that happened to 40-something married moms, but please know that I am not interested.",

He moved in with us and brought his twin daughters (Olivia & Sloane18) with him a couple of months ago.His sister (my wife) and I have one daughter (Zoey 16) and she and her cousins aren't close but get along fine. Olivia & Sloane have no respect for Zoey's privacy, none. they used to walk into her room and take everything they get their hands on. Makeup, phone accessories, clothes, school laptop etc. Zoey complained a lot and I've already asked the girls to respect Zoey's privacy and stop taking things. My wife and Sammy saw no issue with this. After all, they're girls and this's typical teenage girls behavior. I completely disagreed.  Last straw was when Zoey bought a 60$ m.a.c makeup-kit that looks like a paintset that she saved up for over a month and one of the girls, Sloane took it without permission and ruined it by mixing shades together while using it. Don't know much about makeup but that's what Zoey said when she found the kit on her bed, and was crying.I told my wife and she said she'd ask Sloane to apologize but I got Zoey a lock after I found she was moving valuable belongings out the house because of this incidence!!! Sammy and his daughters saw the lock and weren't happy, the girls were extremely upset.Sammy asked about it and I straight up told him. He said my daughters aren't thieves!!! it's normal that girls of the same age borrow each others stuff he said Zoey could easily get another makeup kit for 15 bucks from walmart and shouldn't even be buying expensive - adult makeup in the first place and suggested my wife take care of this defect in Zoey's personality trying to appear older than she is.He accused me of being overprotective and babying Zoey with this level of enablement. I told him this's between me and my wife but she shamed me for putting a lock on Zoey's door for her cousins to see and preventing them from spending time with her saying I was supposed to treat them like daughters, then demanded I remove it but I said this lock does not get removed til her brother and his daughters are out of our house. She got mad I was implying we kick them out and said her family'll hate me for this. so I reminded her that I let Sammy and his family move in which's something her OWN family refused to do so she should start with shaming/blaming them for not taking their own son and nieces/granddaughters in. if it wasn't for her family's unwillingness to help we wouldn't be dealing with this much disturbance at home. Everyone's been giving me and Zoey silent treatment and my wife is very much upset over this.",

        "selftext": "I'm a newly divorced dad of a 3 year old girl. I have her every other week. My daughter has very curly hair that my ex wife used to take care of. Now that I'm alone with her half the time, I have to figure it out. I try but on my weeks her hair was mostly a frizzy, tangled mess. A teacher at my daughter's daycare has very similar hair to my daughter's so I asked if she could help me with my daughter's hair. She said she could do my daughter's hair in the mornings if I dropped her off earlier (dropoff starts at 8, I usually drop her off at 8:45 but her teacher says if I drop her off by 8:20 she'll be able to take care of her hair). She gave me a list of curly hair products to buy and what to bring to school. She also gave me some tips for washing and caring for it at home. I guess my daughter told my ex that her teacher does her hair, not me, and that she goes to daycare early now because my ex called me and asked if I really drop her off a half hour early every morning just so I could avoid doing her hair. She called me a bad parent for relying on a teacher to do my job and for messing up the morning routine so we could get to school early enough for the teacher to do her hair (we used to wake up, give her a bath, I'd attempt to do her hair, we'd have breakfast, then go to school but now we wake up, take a bath, and eat breakfast in the car). I thought I was doing right by making sure her hair is cared for on my weeks but my ex feels very strongly about this so I wanted to know if I was the asshole. Edit: I'm going to add some things to the post that I'm seeing in the comments. I am learning how to care for her hair. Her hair is healthier now than it was a few weeks ago. I have her hair down on the weekends because I still suck at styling it but it still looks good. The teacher really seems to enjoy doing her hair. I know she does other kids' hair but it's not exactly a set thing. Lastly, my ex was not willing to teach me how to do her hair when we were married and is not willing to teach me after the divorce.",

Currently, I'm married to my wife who has adaughter (16) Britney So, Britney is the opposite of Olivia. for example, Britney s a social kid, Olivia is introvert. the list is long but they're just the complete oposite. Olivia's 13th birthday was 2 days ago. She loves chocolate and I decided this is the flavor I was going to go with when I contacted the bakery. However, my wife objected since Britney absolutely hates chocolate and suggested we go with Vanilla. I said no way because for one, Olivia hates vanilla and it's also her birthday so, she gets to have her cake with her favorites flavor. My wife got upset and took it as in I had no regard for Britney and that we should just choose another netural flavor instead. I shut that down and said no more discussing this because I'd already decided to go with what Olivia wanted. At the day of the birthday, I was supposed to go get the cake but I was surprised to see my wife coming home after picking up the cake from the bakery. I looked at it and discovered that it wasn't a chocolate cake but a vanilla cake with small pieces of chocolate on top. I got pissed thinking they got my order wrong and was about to contact them, but my wife said there was no mistake and that she called the bakery the day before and made slight changes to the cake to please both girls. I was stunned I lost it on her and asked why the hell she did that. She got defensive saying that birthdays are no excuse to show favoritism and that her daughter is watching and observing how I'm treating both girls. I told her off since I was the one paying then called the bakery and explained what happened. I had the cake returned and replaced with a chocolate cake. although this one is smaller but it was fine. My wife declined to take part in the celebration and later we got into a huge argument where she called me controlling and selfish for returing the cake instead of using this opportunity to teach Olivia to compromise so everyone's happy. now I'm teaching her to be selfish. I said that my daughter gets to act selfish on her birthday and that she (my wife) was teaching her daughter to be entitled. Word for word and it led to a bigger argument. We're not talking as of now. AITA for returning the cake and not taking my wife's input into consideration?",

I have recently started to have an American live with me, and she introduces herself to people as Irish. Now, I know Americans do this weird thing where they believe they are where their ancestors came from. We Europeans find this hilarious, but what ya gonna do? Recently, I have been researching my family history and she got involved. She is now saying that I should go around saying I am Irish otherwise it is disrespectful to my ancestors. The problem is I am not Irish. I am English. I don't know Irish culture. I have never been to Ireland. I am English. I would argue she isn't Irish either since she has never been to Ireland nor knows Irish culture but, still, she can introduce herself however she wants. She is getting incredibly upset that I am refusing to say I am Irish and she has even started to introduce me as her Irish friend. I told her to stop, and she got annoyed I mean, where do you draw the line on ancestors anyway? Should I introduce myself as African before all my ancestors started out in Africa? No. So, AITA for not saying I am Irish?",

She does a lot of orders for wedding cakes that require custard or marmalade fillings, and I offered to help her out by making these fillings at home and bringing them to her so she has less work to do. Unfortunately, the past four times I\u2019ve made these fillings, my girlfriend (F24) has literally dipped her fingers into the filling jars and contaminated them because, in her words, she \u201cjust wanted to try some.\u201d I\u2019ve tried explaining to her that she can\u2019t dip her fingers in and contaminate the entire batch, because then I have to remake it. I said she should use a spoon and take some out if she wants to try so bad, but she just pouts and says that she likes using her fingers because it takes her back to her childhood. Today, I was trying to finish some chocolate custard to send it over to my sister really fast because she was running late on a wedding cake order for an important client. I told my girlfriend beforehand to not eat the custard, and if she really wanted to, to please use a spoon.  I get out of the shower, and what do I see? She has her fingers in it again! I totally lost it because this is the fifth time she blatantly disregarded what I said, and I yelled at her and told her to \u201cstop fucking eating\u201d the food I\u2019m making, because it\u2019s not for her and she\u2019s contaminating it.  She started crying and got mad at me for \u201cfat-shaming\u201d her, even though I made no comment on her weight and she has no history of weight issues or eating disorders.

        "selftext": "My husband (Asian) and I (american) welcomed our first born 4 weeks ago. The baby is health (Thank God) but I'm exhausted, haven't fixed my hair, barely able to shower and can not sleep. My husband's family had been pressuring us to visit to meet the baby. I tried to hold them off as much as I could but yesterday, I was surprised to find them standing on the porch. turns out hubby invited them for dinner. I was embarrassed and felt like I wasn't ready for visitors (judgemental ones at that \ud83d\ude09) cause the house was a M.E.S.S y'all. Anyways, my husband sat with them while I fed my son then later I asked my husband if we should order take out for dinner. He said NO because his parents would find this rude and unwelcoming. He suggested that I go inside the kitchen and prepare something, anything long as it's homemade. I said fine then went and made some Mac N cheese. The reason I prepared this meal is because of how easy it is. Once I served the family, My husband's mom looked at me and was appalled. I noticed something was wrong. She asked if I really found it appropriate to serve her and the family Mac N cheese. I asked why not and she went on a rant about how disrespectful this was and that I clearly have no experience in what is right and wrong when it comes to hosting. I said excuse me? Who said I signed up to host an expected visit from them and she took it as in I didn't want them there. her husband said they were just there to finally see the baby that I kept them from seeing for an entire month. that's a whole month of his life they missed out on. We had an argument and they decided to go home. My husband said that deciding to serve his family Mac N cheese was more offensive then serving them nothing at all. I told him I was too exhausted to cook their traditional feasts that I was forced to learn from his mom. He took offense and said that I was being mean and disrespectful towards not only his family but his culture. I went inside the bedroom to stay with my son. My husband stayed on the phone with his family for an hour then kept giving me the cold shoulder and refused to eat what I cook in support of his family. I understand how some guests might find it offensive especially his family. but I was just trying to make a quick homemade meal like my husband wanted. What's wrong with Mac N cheese? EDIT* Ok, So I'm seeing commenters here offering to come over for some Mac N cheese. It's amazing to hear that some people here would aporeciate this kind of meal. It kinda makes me feel relieved and reassures me that I didn't mess this up entirely. Come on in Y'all! I'll be more than happy to serve you some mac n cheese, some of y'all even offered to bring mashed potatoes and pizza. LOL would love to have y'all over some time.",

        "selftext": "Hello Reddit! I have just downloaded Reddit because my niece said I should post this story to the AITA board so here I am! I am not very good with technology so forgive me but I'll probably be messing this whole post up! \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02  So basically here's what happened. Me and my wife hired our babysitter who we've been going to for years, we have 2 sons and a daughter and we've been hiring her since my oldest son was a baby (though it was mostly her mom looking after the baby while she was 'helping' so we gave her a couple of dollars for that \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02). She's now 16 and can look after the kids all on her own and my oldest two love her! (My youngest is only 7 months so I'm not sure he really gets it yet \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02, but he seems relatively happy when he's with her).  This Friday my kids daycare has been closed for renovations and Daisy (our babysitter) has kindly offered to take care of them after school, from 3:30-6pm! I get home from work at 6 and my wife gets home at half 6, however, I got home early from work at half five, when I got home I found my wife yelling at Daisy while Daisy was just sobbing and apologizing, I asked my wife what was going on and all she did was just start yelling that Daisy had cost us a bunch of money, my first thought was that she'd broken something, but my wife wasn't telling me what it was. She told Daisy she wouldn't be paying her for her time and to get the f*ck out of our house and never come back or she'd call the police. Daisy then ran out crying and I left my wife to calm down while I comforted my kids (they were all crying in a different room while my wife yelled at Daisy). When everything had calmed down, I got the full story from my wife.  So here's what happened: My mother had been looking after the kids until 3:30 while we were at work. This was Daisy's first time looking after my youngest son, though we knew we could trust her with the babies since she looked after my daughter alone when she was a baby. Something important that you should know is that my youngest son has breath holding episodes, which occur when he gets frustrated or is in pain, and he will just hold his breath, to stop them you just have to blow on the baby or they will just snap out of it on their own, they're completely normal and relatively safe in babies, however, the episodes can sometimes cause passing out and blueness, and it's normal and he usually wakes up within a few seconds. To cut a long story short my mom forgot to tell Daisy what to do if that happens, and when my son passed out, Daisy panicked and called 911, and then my wife. My wife is now angry that Daisy called 911 for 'nothing' and has now wasted our money on an ambulance ride. Me and my wife are now arguing because I think Daisy did the right thing but my wife doesn't, yesterday we got into a heated argument, we both said some hurtful stuff and she is now staying with her mother for a few days while she 'thinks over my priorities in the relationship'.

        "selftext": "Yeah, I know this sounds awful. My (32M) wife's (35F) daughter (16F) recently announced she is pregnant.  She claims she doesn't know who the father is. I suspect she actually does and doesn't want to say, for whatever reason. I mean how much unprotected sex is a 16 year old really having? It can't be that hard to narrow it down for goodness sake. Anyway, moving on. She is adamant on keeping the baby. Abortion is out of the question apparently. Wife completely supports her decision and is excited about having her first grand kid. They're both ecstatic. The problem I have with this is: 1. My wife's daughter is not going to be the one to look after this kid. She's still in school and fully intends to go to college. My wife and I will 100% end up looking after it. 2. I am going to be the one paying tens of thousands of dollars to raise this kid. My wife works part time and makes very little money. I don't have a problem with this as it lets her do volunteer work that she enjoys, but it means the financial burden of this kid will be 100% on me. 3. I wanted to have at least one kid with my wife. She's entering her late 30s so it's now or never. I feel like this kid will mean the two of us will never have our own because of both the emotional and financial burden raising it will put on us. I raised my concerns with my wife and her response was expected but disappointing. This isn't up to you. This is her decision to make. We will support her. I agree it's her decision, but why do I have to support her? As it stands now, I'm thinking of cutting my losses and leaving the marriage if her daughter has this child. I'm not prepared to put off starting my own family for the sake of her daughter, nor am I prepared to pay to raise it. I fully intend to let them know this before the baby is born so they can make an informed decision on whether they can support it. AITA?",

My birth dad John was married to my mom for a few years, then she left my dad and yeah. They ended up divorcing and now she's somewhere in California, idk where or what she's doing. Haven't talked to her in ages.  So dad, and pops i'm super close with. They are the best parents any child could ask for. I love both of them and they've always been with me. My dad introduced me to pops when i was a little boy and they had told me they were in a relationship (and i was all for it because i had saw my dad become lonely/sad when he was single) so seeing the fact that my dad loves someone and has a life partner made me super happy.  Pops & Dad got married, and we've been living an amazing life. I'm probably more to close to Pops then my own dad haha. Due to the fact that Pops is really cool and he's laid back. I love both of them equally and they love me as well, and i'm blessed to have them as parents. For a few months i've been dating this girl bella who's my age. I thought she's pretty cute and i liked her. So we kicked it and recently she told me My parents want to meet your parents and want to come over for dinner I said sure. I'll tell my family.  So yesterday, Friday night. Bella comes in. Pops greets her and says Come on in sweetheart, dinner is ready. She says You must be ____ dad so good to meet you and she shakes his hand and she sees Dad come out of the kitchen He's holding the mac n cheese tray with the mittens and is putting it on the table. Then bella says Who's he? i said, Oh that's my dad. She said I though he's your dad she's referring to Pops. I say yeah. That's my pops? And that's my dad? She pulls me to the side and says I didn't know your parents are gay? Oh my god? why didn't you tell me? I genuinely didn't know why, that'd be an issue or so. Because your dating me, not my parents and all. So it shouldn't matter. But i guess it's a concern for her. Her parents come at the door after they parked the car and bella tells her parents let's leave and they left. I told my parents i'm sorry and they said son don't worry this is nothing new haha and then we all sat down and enjoyed dinner and went to sleep.  So AITA for not telling?",

        "selftext": "I (38F) bought a 4 bedroom house in semi-rural Buckinghamshire when I was 23. It was a lovely big house, but the town was not fun for a 23 year old. I always said I'd love it of I were 40 with kids, but it wasn't a great place for someone in their 20s. When I was 26, I put the house on the rental market and moved to London where I lived for 2 years before moving to Australia.  I found a lovely family to rent the house. A husband and wife both in their mid to late 40s with one child, no pets, and respectable jobs. Rent was always paid on time, the estate agent always had good reports from inspection visits and we never heard ant complaints from neighbours.  FF 14 years later, they're still living there. I've been travelling the world full time for some years, spent the pandemic in Australia then resumed travelling post lock downs. I'm now ready to return home, so I informed my estate agent that I want to break the contract and have them move out in 3 months' time, 2 months more notice than I'm obligated to give.  The tenants were surprised to hear I was coming back and tried to ask if I was coming to live with my family. The agent brushed off question and told them to vacate in 3 months and that they can help find alternative accommodation. Tenants texted me directly to ask same question and I replied haha, no husband or kids in tow - just ready to set roots again! Looking forward to being home (I grew up 20 mins aways). I got a text calling me selfish for: kicking them out of their home of nearly 15 years; wanting a big house all to myself; placing my needs of travel and enjoyment ahead of starting a family and getting married. They told me I should leave them to buy the house for what I bought it for (it's doubled in price since) and go live in my other house. I replied you can dictate in a house that you own, not one that I own. Please have your things packed by x date or I'll evict you and sue you for the costs.  My friends are saying I'm kicking them out of their home and I don't need such a big place so I can rent or sell my student flat for a deposit for a house nearby. My rented house is 90% paid though and I don't want to start again with a new mortgage. I want to live in my house. I have been fair to the tenants and reasonable in my request. AITA? Recently learnt of the edit feature haha.  Okay, thank you for the feedback. I will be asking the estate agent to ask what ways I can help make this transition easier. I'm willing to extend the notice period by a few months if they want to. Thank you to those who remained civil in their disagreement. Bye :)",

        "selftext": "I (26f) recently moved into my first home. I am also 4 months pregnant with our first baby. The pregnancy has been very hard. I have horrible morning sickness. It reached a really bad point where I passed out hit my head and my Dr admitted me to the hospital for a week.  When I got home my husband allowed his brothers family to move into 2 of our 3 bedrooms. (They were evicted i dont know why). One room was My office was tossed into our room papers every where. The house was a complete wreck. Trash, dirty clothes, used diapers. I started to cry. It was like a light flipped my husband was no longer the same.  My husband told me it wasn't that bad. My reply was fine then you should have the house cleaned up before I wake up. Completly exhaustedI fell asleep for 4 hrs. I woke up and went to get a drink of water. I couldn't every glass we own is scattered around the house. They didnt clean a single thing. I passive aggressively started to pick up the dirty dishes and washed them. The following morning. I was trying my best to work when their kids were crying non stop. Banging on the walls so on. Their mom was in her room for hours ignoring them.   When my husband came home. He was upset with me over how I didn't make his brother's wife feel welcome in our home. By helping with their kids when she was tired. Then continued to complain how nothing was done while he was at work all day in the house. Yep the same one he didn't clean. That lead to a fight where I told him. I am too sick to have company and they need to leave.  To which he replied they are his family and he won't kick them out. I started to cry again.  I was beyond frustrated, exhausted, I physically couldnt do it anymore. I called my mom asking if I could come stay with her. Telling her the whole story infront of my husband. Who at this point was completely shocked, Angry, also I could tell he wasnt sure what to do. My mom came with my brother's (I have 3 older brothers). My mom super angry told my husband. Since your family can stay so can we. My mom quickly took charge. I was sent to bed. My brother's started cleaning complaining loudly at how disgusting my BIL family is. Along with what a horrible husband my husband is for putting me through this while I am sick. I got a text message from my MIL for calling me an A for not helping my husband clean up the house and putting my BIL in a uncomfortable position by having my mom boss him around. Edited to add update, when my MIL showed up she was super angry outside. I could hear shouting but, couldn't understand what was said. Once inside she was shocked. My house looked really bad. My BIL lied to her about what happened. My MIL quickly started to help my mom in the bossing mode.My house is not just cleaned but deep cleaned. My BIL and his kids are now staying with MIL. She didn't know about the eviction. My in-laws helped them financially a couple of months ago. My MIL was not happy about it. SIL refused to come out of the bedroom. She would scream through the door but that was about it until her family came to pick her up. Last little bit. I did talk to my husband. He seemed very remorseful. I asked for some space he is staying at a hotel. He asked to come by and talk to me tonight.  My mom and dad are here. Both mom's felt like I should have someone here since I am sick.Both moms have set up a meal plan. Where they trade off who will bring in dinner. It was my MIL idea. Thank you for all your advice. I truly appreciate it. Talk with husband: summed up since it lasted 4 hrs.  it was a hard talk.  He is remorseful.Bil was only supposed to stay for a couple of nights. Then leave originally he thought they would be gone before I got home. He said he is tired and emotionally upset himself. When I originally passed out. My husband left to help a friend move. He came home and found me. He said he has no idea how long I was on the floor hurt. He was originally scared I had died.Since then he has had nightmares. On top of dealing with his family drama. He admitted to dumping his frustration onto me. When it's not my fault. He begged me for another chance. The next steps. We are still separated. He plans on staying at my brother house in his casita. We are going to go to marriage counseling and Individual counseling. He asked if he could come when the home health nurse comes each night and to my Dr's appointments. I agreed to that. Update on BIL: his wife admitted to having and affair. She told him she got married too soon and doesn't want the responsibilities of being a mom anymore. I am not sure what will happen with him and his kids but, I am shocked that she feels this way especially with her kids.",

        "selftext": "Throwaway account. Me (35m) and my gf, Sara (35f) have been together for 4 years. She has a son, Nathan (9m), with her ex Mark (36m). Sara has full  custody of Nathan with her ex having scheduled visitations one weekend of every month. Sara and Nathan moved in with me a little over a year and a half ago and in my perspective, it was a little rocky at first. I've always been pretty protective of my space so making room for two other people was difficult for me. When Sara moved in with me we agreed that the visitations for Mark would be held in our apartment as long as I'm home. The main reason I wanted this is because I don't know Mark that well, and I don't want him wandering around our apartment without me there. When we proposed this idea to Mark, he was fine with it. Now moving on to the real issue. Three weeks ago marked four months since Mark's last visit so I had asked Sara when he was planning on visiting Nathan. My gf replied by shrugging her shoulders and telling me she'd ask. She never followed up with it. So a few days ago, I asked when Mark's next visit was and Sara said she'd tell me when she knew. Nathan was in the living room but had apparently overheard us and shouted something along the lines of dad was here last weekend remember. Sara's face immediately dropped and when I asked what Nathan meant, she wouldn't give me a direct answer. Eventually she ended up telling me that for the past two visits, Mark had been to our apartment when I was working. When I accused her of going back on our agreement, she kept telling me this was her home too and she could invite whoever she wanted, and that it was fine because she was here and watching. I told her that was besides the point and she violated my trust. It blew up into a huge argument with ended in me telling her to get out of my apartment. She packed up and left with Nathan. Last I heard she was staying with her parents. I've gotten several messages from both Sara and her parents calling me an asshole for kicking Sara and Nathan out of their home for something so small. She's even been blasting me on Instagram and Facebook about how horrible I am to do this to her. It's got me thinking I might be the AH but I'm not entirely sure yet. AITA? ETA: I can see why it's important but the court order was instructed because of Mark having a criminal record. I'm not sure what it's for as Sara has never directly told me and I didn't want to push her to tell me.   Eta 2: Update posted to my account.",

        "selftext": "This whole situation has gotten way out of hand to the point everyone is yelling at everyone and I\u2019m sleeping in the guest bedroom. My wife\u2019s parents are at the point in their lives where they can no longer live by themselves. Their children decided the best place for them is an assisted living facility. They started to look into different facilities and admittedly, I didn\u2019t help because I figured the 5 adult siblings could handle it and I was never close to my in-laws. They found one that was perfect and my wife was very excited when she told me about it. I was less than thrilled when I found out our contribution will be roughly $3,000 upfront then $5,000 a month. I immediately question why it cost roughly $15,000 upfront fee and $25,000 a month for 2 people in an assisted living apartment. I admit I sarcastically asked if their apartment is next door to Elon Musk\u2019s parents. She then told me that we\u2019re going to cover the lion\u2019s share of the costs because we make more than her siblings. That was the beginning of a week of texts, phone, and in-person arguments. She argues that her siblings make less money combined than we do and some are single so it would impact them more thus so it\u2019s only fair we pay more. She also argues that this facility is not the best or most expensive, it\u2019s a mid tier one with the best ratings. According to her, anything lower have bad ratings and could put her parents\u2019 safety in jeopardy. My argument is that there are 5 siblings so the costs should be divided equally between the 5 of them. I also argued that if 5 people can\u2019t afford that place, they need to lower their standards. That started a circular argument for hours between cost and safety. I couldn\u2019t take it anymore and in the heat of the moment, I yelled, \u201cwe don\u2019t make more that your brothers and sisters, I make more than all of you which is why you all want me to cover the cost for YOUR parents!\u201d That was the beginning of my nights sleeping in the guest bedroom. I know as a married couple I shouldn\u2019t consider \u201cmine\u201d and \u201cyours\u201d income but realistically I do make more than all of them and I think it\u2019s unfair to make me pay the largest portion. What do you all think? Update I\u2019m going to answer some questions. 1. I assumed it was $25,000 a month because I assumed it was split 5 ways between the siblings and our share was $5,000 a month. It\u2019ll be closer to $10,000 a month and our share is $5,000. 2. Her parents have assets including a house so I was told they don\u2019t qualify for government assistance. I brought up the idea of selling their house but was shot down immediately. The siblings want to keep the house in the family because their great grandfather built it or something. 3. I can afford to pay it but I don\u2019t want to based on principle. Their division means I\u2019ll be paying $5,000 a month while the youngest brother will be paying only $300 a month and will be living in the house. Their thinking is that he\u2019ll be paying the insurance and taxes on the house so he can\u2019t afford more than $300. Another update  4. I\u2019m the only child to my parents. While they planned out their retirement, they worked their entire lives to put me through school and supported me through several degrees. I will be solely responsible for and will make sure their remaining days will be comfortable. 5. Per your suggestion, I asked my wife if we\u2019re going contribute this much money to her parents, how they\u2019re going to contribute to my parents when their time comes. She answered, \u201cdon\u2019t be an idiot, that\u2019s an entirely different situation.\u201d 6. I don\u2019t want ownership of their house because it\u2019s very old and needs major work. I brought up the idea of selling the house again and it was shot down again. They\u2019re not budging on it. 7. None of us know the laws and regulations when it comes to this so I finally got her to agree for us to sit down with an estate attorney.  8. Unless I feel up to it, this is probably the last update. I feel completely emotionally drained. I always knew my parents would get old but I never thought about it.",

        "selftext": "For some reason my 14 year old son cannot wipe properly.  This was never a concern to me as his mom did the laundry.   Unfortunately she is sick right now so I have taken over the household chores that she used to handle.  My son is still responsible for his and I do mine as well as hers.   First day I did laundry I gagged and almost puked from his underwear.  If he were three and not fully potty trained I might understand how they end up like this.  But he is a healthy young man.  He should not be leaving his ass this unwiped.   I talked to him about it and he said he would make an effort to do a better job.  Nope. No change in the situation.  So I went to the hardware store and installed a wand bidet in the bathroom he uses.  We already have one in ours.  I told him that he has a choice of either using the bidet or washing his own underwear.  He doesn't know how to use the washing machine and he refuses to do them by hand.  He started going commando.  Which just meant the problem was his jeans now.   So I said that we might need to take him to the doctor to see what is wrong with him.  If it's physical or psychological.  I also said that the next time his friends were over I was going to ask them is they left their underwear in the same condition.  I WOULD NEVER ACTUALLY EMBARRASS HIM LIKE THAT. He said I was being an asshole and he called his mom to tell her what I was doing.  She said that he was just like that and I could deal with it until she was better.   I don't think that's a great plan.  If this kid never learns to wipe his ass he will be bereft of a sexual partner without a poop fetish.  I'm not kinkshaming him if that's his thing.   He has started using the bidet but he says that it is gross and weird.  I said it was grosser and weirder for a 14 year old to crap his pants every day.  We are both stressed about his mom but this situation isn't because of her. I asked her.",

        "selftext": "I\u2019m an atheist who works in an international company in a very busy city.  I have a lot of coworkers who come from a certain religious background that requires them to pray multiple times a day. I would say 90% of my coworkers share this faith and maybe 70-80% of them take the time out to go pray everyday.  They get to leave the office 2 or 3 times in a day for 10 mins a piece for prayer and they get paid the same, don\u2019t need to take time out of their lunch, etc.   I used to resent this and asked my boss who belongs to that faith why they were essentially having an extra paid 30 min break a day for doing the same work I do. She couldn\u2019t give me a response other than religious considerations have to be made.  Even though I\u2019m a known atheist I decided I too wanted some time to meditate everyday. I told my manager I needed the same time as my coworkers and told her it was very important to me. She initially said no, and then I got a hastily written email saying of course I was welcome to take that time to meditate the same day. She\u2019d obviously checked with HR and covered her ass.  For the last six months I\u2019ve been having my 30 mins \u2018meditating\u2019 out in our company garden everyday. This has caused a slight issue because other non religious people are starting to ask if they too can have \u2018meditative time\u2019 and it\u2019s causing friction but imo either everyone should be able to have this or no one should.  I recently told a friend this story and she reacted negatively- she said that I was being rude and \u2018ruining it\u2019 for everyone else and that at Xmas time my coworkers usually go over and beyond to fill in holiday hours so the rest of us can enjoy our holidays and that the same courtesy should be extended to them. I told her I\u2019m not hurting anybody or taking their prayer times away from them, simply enjoying that privilege myself.",

We went to a small mall, half the day on the bench. It was window shopping. She is obese, her ankles are swollen from her weight. The connection between her weight and not walking far without a break is very obvious. Post: I will try to keep this short. I have three girls and we still like to do girl trips for the day. My son got married to a girl named Beth. Now before her first kids she was average weight and after it got a lot worse. Her only kid is 8 years old at this point and she hasn\u2019t lost the weight. It\u2019s bad enough that she needs constant breaks walking.  I used to like her and now I don\u2019t due to how she acts. Everywhere we go with her it is constant complaining that she is tired. The last girls trip to the mall was spent sitting on a bench half the day since she needed constant break. If you try to leave she will go on about abandoning her. It\u2019s annoying. I invited the girls to go to a farm for pumpkin patch and pick some apples. It has big orchards and a ton of walking. We went it was a great time and some pictures went on Facebook.

I told her she wasn\u2019t invited due her weight. That she forces us to stop all the time and it ruins the trips most days since we don\u2019t get to do half the stuff.

The problem is that she has been randomly walking in on me while I'm in the bathroom. Thankfully not once has she seen me naked because I started picking up on her behavior after the second time in a week. She'd barge in, then turns and says oh sorry then close the door. I tried talking to my husband about it but he kept ignoring me then flatout said so what if she accidently seen you naked? She's faaaammmillly!!. He seriously said that!. We have a lock and I could've used it but I have past trauma from the idea of locking/being locked in a room after my brother locked me in the bathroom when I was 5. So I came up with this idea. I'd go inside the bathroom pretending to use it and wait for her to come (cause honestly? It's deliberate at the this point). When she accidently barges in she'd see me in a weird/awkward position. For example doing a ballet stand, standing on the toilet, or standing facing the wall with my hands up, (fully clothed of course). I could see how awkward and weird this would be for her because she'd stand there for few seconds trying to figure out what I was doing. It was halirious at first seeing her initial confusion but she told my husband about it claiming she's caught me practicing rituals in the bathroom. I cleared things up and revealed the reason why. My husband was livid. He called me childish and said that I made his mom feel terrified/weirded out by my behavior. He said I should've acted maturely and locked the damn door instead of playing mind games. Edit. Lol. Um what? I just came back on here and saw literally 1000s? of people? OMG now I feel embarrassed Glad I went anonymous Lol. But seriously...I'm looking at my screen and am like ....I'm famous? Seriously though...My husband and his mom are extremely upset with me. He still thinks it was ridiculous and is demanding an apology before she goes back to her home.  I'm not sure if I will apologize because yes while it was a me problem that I couldn't use the lock. It's still feels wrong what she did and maybe I'm wrong too but at least I got (so did you apparently lol) a bit of a chuckle out of it \ud83d\ude05\ud83e\udd23 also, I'm sure Thanksgiving dinner will hella awkward tomorrow.

Back info - We aren\u2019t dog people.  I\u2019ve had girlfriends end relationships with me over the fact I don\u2019t want a dog.  In the topic of pets, my current spouse is very compatible.  They just aren\u2019t our thing and our friends know this about us.  Like we aren\u2019t the type to pet them all.   A key part of this story, nearly every restaurant has patios that are dog friendly while indoors is not.  Its nearly impossible to find non pet friendly patios.  \r  \r  Our friends however are now pet people.  They got a dog over covid. They\u2019ve become the people that take it every where with them. My fianc\u00e9 and I do hang out with them less because of it.  We showed up about 10 minutes early for our reservation.  I intended to eat indoors.  Turns out our friends beat us here.  We were led to a patio table and see they brought their dog.  I say no, I\u2019m not doing this. What are you thinking bringing that? \r  \r  Fiance and I went inside to see if the bar had any seats, and my buddy chased us  down.  Explains the dog sitter fell through and the dog will just lay their and not bother us.  I don\u2019t care, mentioned not sure why they need a sitter and we aren\u2019t spending our meal with a dog.  Told him its fucked up you spring your dog on us. \r  \r  There were no bar seats, so fianc\u00e9 and I decided to leave.  My buddy said I\u2019m an asshole.  I told him I\u2019m not spending time with you dog.  We\u2019ll figure somewhere else out to go.  I got texts saying how fucked up what we did was.  Am I the Asshole here?\r  ",

        "selftext": " I f32 been dating John m37 for 2 years. He's a single dad to 3 kids [4m (jr) ,6m,9m]. I moved in with him and his kids a little while ago. I gave to say that he's super protective of his kids, I haven't been able to meet them til later because he said they might not like me and so he started easing them into accepting me by encouraging me and pushing me to be extra friendly to them by buying them stuff and cooking for them daily. He's very busy often times, and the boys have now clinged on to me because they see me more than they see him. Don't get me wrong; I'm grateful for this outcome but the issue is that I can't be away from them for a long time. More than hours. Now that I'd moved in I can't go anywhere without taking them with me. I can barely have time for myself but what's worse is that my work got interrupted by that. John suggested I work less hours but it didn't happen. Now my sister is getting married soon. It'll be held hours away so I'll have to travel. The invitation stated child-free so I can't take the kids. When John heard about this he told me to immediately call and apologize cause I won't be attending. I was stunned I asked why and he went on about how much the kids adore me and how they'll go crazy when I'm hours away from them. besides, that he's too busy to look after them. I said it's not my fault and he should either take time off work and stay with them or get a babysitter. He threw a fit about how selfish and unfeeling I was and that he will only let me attend the wedding when I tell my sister to let the kids come but I can't ask such thing of her! I INSISTED on going after he kept saying I shouldn't go. He went and told the boys that I was looking for an excuse to get some time away from then and now they won't even speak to me. I confronted him about what he did and he said it's the result of me insisting on going to the wedding and choosing my sister over my stepkids. He even said I should be thankful the kids accept me for who I am and are giving me this much attention. I was speechless and felt offended. AITA for standing my ground and wanting to go? She's my only sister and we have a great relationship so not attending her wedding can cause issues. EDITING SOME INFORMATION: to answer the question about the biological mom. His eldest is from his late wife. He then dated his ex girlfriend and had his middle and youngest child with her. Now she's out of the picture. The eldest user to be kind of distant from his half brothers and had issues with them for years. I was left to navigate through that and help him re-bond with them. Like I said all of them like to spend time with me so as a result they are bonding together, which is a great thing. John was clearly too busy to try to fix this problem a long time ago.",

        "selftext": "So I (18f) am very lucky in that I have two very hardworking parents that are successful and love me. We aren't mega-wealthy but we are very comfortable as my parents are extremely smart financially. We own multiple houses as part of our real estate portfolio that we rent out for extra income. I recently started college and as a present for working hard and getting into my dream school my parents gifted me one of our houses that is near my college. I was going to inherit them all anyway but I really appreciated their gesture. Where I live real estate law is a little tricky and we would have to pay significant taxes to officially transfer the house to me so we decided to have my parents own it legally for now. The house is pretty big with 4 floors(including a fully furnished basement) and a roomy attic and since it is near my school I decided to look for roommates so I could start earning money early. So far I have two roommates, who we'll call Sasha(18f) and Bea(19f) who also go to my school. We have been living together for a couple months now(they moved in around August) and we are all pretty good friends, and very compatible roommates. This is where I might be the asshole. I didn't want to tell them that I own the house as I thought it might create a weird dynamic between us, and I didn't want them to view me any differently. We split the bills and rent, with me technically paying nothing. Since my father legally owns the house and we have different surnames(I took my mothers last name) they have no idea I own the house or that my dad just sends the money back to me. Sasha recently found the money my dad sent back while I was at class and told Bea, and they cornered me about it a few days ago. I told them everything and they're mad at me for hiding this from them and think I'm not only in the wrong for keeping it a secret but for making them pay rent in the first place. The house's mortgage has already been paid off so the rent goes entirely into my pocket. I responded by saying that they shouldn't have gone through my mail in the first place and that it was illegal, which I'll admit was kind of a low blow. We weren't friends when they moved in and the whole point of me wanting roommates was so that I could earn extra cash so I don't see why I should let them reside for free. AITA here? Edit 1: people in the comments were asking, basically we have a system where whoever is home brings all the mail in and puts it on the kitchen island. Bea brought the mail in but Sasha opened my mail before I got home. My dad doesn't send me straight up cash lol, he mails two cheques, with the amount Sasha and Bea paid, and when Sasha saw the cheques from the landlord to me with the exact amount of her and Bea's rent she put two and two together and interrogated me when I came home. I don't know why she opened my mail in the first place, I've never noticed her snooping before but maybe she has and I just never saw. Edit 2: ok answering a couple things I keep seeing in the comments. Yes I know the assets aren't technically mine but Inhave unlimited access to them, will inherit all of them one day(my parents have told me this directly it's not an assumption) and my parents consider it equally mine, so yes I consider them mine as well. I didn't earn them, I was just lucky enough to be born to amazing parents and I'm grateful to them for that. *generic comment about evil landlords: Bea and Sasha are NOT poor, and I'm not charging way above market price. If they felt the price was too steep they could dorm which is actually cheaper or find a cheaper place. They are paying extra for luxury, I'm not exploiting broke children. Why use cheques instead of ebanking: I do all of my business online but my dad bought a fancy custom mailbox and he's trying(and failing) to concince my mom that it wasn't a waste so he likes to mail EVERYTHING now. I get letters instead of texts. Yes it's ridiculous and after this incident we'll definitely be doing our finances online only. I maintain that I'm not mega rich. Yes, I acknowledge that I'm extremely privileged compared to most other Americans but in my head at least mega rich is people like my boyfriend's family that own actual mansions, and have yachts, or like celebrities and billionaires with private jets etc. Compared to most of my friends I'm middle class. Why I changed my last name when I'm on good terms with my father: My parents are both British Indian immigrants, and my dad has a super ethnic and long hard to pronounce last name whereas my mom has a nice short and cute last name. When I apply for jobs people will judge me based on my name and I don't want that. My dad faced that discrimination and I grew up in a predominantly white community so I know people's perception of you change based on how American/white you are perceived to be. Also my mom went through labour and 9 months of pregnancy, she deserves to have her last name continued. UPDATE: I can't believe it's actually been almost a month since I posted this, school is crazy. Anyways lots of yall were asking for an update; Sasha ended up moving out amicably and I waived this month's rent for her and Bea because I felt bad about lying to them. The comments are right, it was selfish, I was only thinking about how I wanted to avoid confrantation and awkwardness and I wasn't thinking about their feelings. Bea and I did aquire another roommate, who I was upfront with. I told her my parents own the house and they sent me the money back, and she was actually pretty chill about it. My dad transfers the money to me the normal way now(my mom chewed him out for the whole situation). I'm NOT pressing charges against Sasha, she doesn't need a felony on her record because she made one mistake, especially since I made one too. We still talk occasionally because we have some of the same classes, but I'm just glad the whole thing is over. Thanks to all the POLITE(some of yall have a lot of resentment you should work through) comments, your insight was invaluable. ",

        "selftext": "Throwaway because this is already enough of a mess. TW: miscarriage/stillbirth. I (26f) am planning my wedding to my fiance (27m) in a few months. Everything is going great and I love him so much. I can't wait to spend my life with him. He loves my family, and I, for the most part, love his. A bit of background, fiance has a much older brother. While my future MIL was pregnant three times in between them, all of them resulted in late miscarriages and stillbirths. As a result, MIL put all of her motherly love and attention on fiance. He had never tried a fruit or vegetable before I met him because his parents never made him when he was young and he had grown up assuming they were gross. (I got him to try some and he loves them now.) As we were planning our guest list, we consulted our families about which, and how many, relatives we should invite. Future MIL asked that we invite fiance's dead brother and sisters. When we asked what she meant, she wanted us to put up a framed photo of the dead babies in the pews at our wedding ceremony, and then save them seats at our reception. I was horrified. First of all, we are trying to have a fairly small wedding to start with, and a beautiful, intimate venue. We can only have seats for 30-50 people, and I would like these places to be for our friends and family, not people who have never met either of us because they are dead. Fiance agrees that three of 50 seats reserved for dead people is too many. He suggested we compromise and just let MIL put up all three photos in one seat.  Personally, I think it's gross and weird to include any of them. We're starting our lives together. We want to have a family and it almost seems like a bad omen, but it means a lot to her and it's a fairly small ask. Fiance's parents are paying for 75% of our wedding, and this is the only request she's had. So AITA for still refusing?",

        "selftext": " I (F) have been married to my husband Jeff for a year now. He has a daughter (12) with his deceased wife. When I first met Jeff it was obvious that he was struggling as a single parent. For my stepdaughter's birthday he'd usually get a cake from the bakery. This has been the case since her mom passed away. I thought I'd bake her a birthday cake for her 12th birthday that was last week as a gesture to show some motherly love and support. Jeff agreed and he told me what his daughter's favorite flavors are and what she likes and so on. I baked the cake in the flavor she likes and the icing she likes but one thing was missing and that is the blueberries and I couldn't include them because I went to the nearest store and they didn't have them. I was running out of time and couldn't get them so I ended up just leaving the cake as it thinking it wouldn't be a big deal. The party started and Jeff was busy taking care of everything else. He then came into the kitchen and asked to see the cake before bringing it out. I showed it to him and he got so angry when he saw that there were no blueberries on top. He went on and on about how I didn't fully commit to making the cake and that he trusted me to take care of it and just basically saying that he should've just ordered one from the bakery. We got into an argument and he ended up taking it and throwing it in the trashcan. I was stunned as he said you know what? Forget it, I'll get one from the bakery. I blew up and screamed at him, he told me to stop but I went upstairs, got dressed and left. He tried getting me to stay but I refused and went to my parents'. He later called and then texted about how I overreacted and hurt him and my stepdaughter by leaving. Also said that I created this situation by not properly making the birthday cake just cause I didn't put blueberries on top. I refused to respond but my parents say he was justified since he must've felt pressured from the stress of making his daughter happy on her birthday. He keeps trying to speak to me but I don't respond. AITA? did I overreact?",

Moments later he noticed it too, and I apologised, realising I must have started my period. My boyfriend freaked out and started shouting at me, asking why I'd ruined his favourite jeans.

I felt pretty upset and guilty, especially when I checked my period tracker and realised I was due to start today, and I should have been more wary that I was close to starting my period. Today he's apologised for shouting, but says he still upset about the jeans. He thinks I should have been more careful knowing that I was due to start my period today.

        "selftext": "My (42F) ex husband (45M) and I were together for 20 years. We had a beautiful daughter together, Joceline (14F). We got a divorce 5 years ago due to infidelity on his part. I was devastated. He was the love of my life and he betrayed all of the trust and loyalty we had built up. To make matters worse, he ended up in a relationship with the woman he cheated on me with. They got engaged one year later and are set to be married in two weeks. Honestly, I still am heartbroken over my divorce. It\u2019s hurtful to me that we were together for 20 years, and he could just go fall in love with someone else, as if I was nothing. However, Joceline was only 9 when we divorced, and he\u2019s a great father so I would never want to come in between their bond. Joceline loves his fianc\u00e9e as she\u2019s very sweet to her, but she doesn\u2019t know the reason why her dad and I divorced, I want to tell her when she\u2019s a bit older and he doesn\u2019t want to tell her at all. Anyways, I compromised with him that Joceline could come to the wedding, but that he would have to provide the transportation to and from the wedding, as I want no part of it. I don\u2019t want to drop my daughter off at his wedding, I don\u2019t want to see all the decorations and the happy guests, it\u2019d just be too much for me. I didn\u2019t tell him all of that obviously, but he agreed. Today he calls me and asks if he can ask for a huge favor. It turns out that his future in laws are flying in the morning of the wedding, and he has to go pick them up, therefore he can\u2019t pick up my daughter the day of and wanted to ask if I could take her. I said absolutely not and asked why he can\u2019t pick her up the day before when she gets off of school. He said he doesn\u2019t want to make the drive twice, and that he will likely not have time as he has to prepare for the rehearsal dinner. I asked why can\u2019t the bride pick up her parents, he said she\u2019ll be getting her hair done and won\u2019t be able to. I laughed and told him there was no way I\u2019d take my daughter, and that he\u2019d have to figure it out. Boy why did I say that. My daughter ran downstairs crying, face beet red 10 minutes after my conversation with her dad, calling me terrible and accusing me of not wanting her to spend time with her dad. I told her that\u2019s not the case and she demanded to know why I couldn\u2019t take her, I couldn\u2019t give her an answer and she ran upstairs crying. Now I\u2019m getting messages from his family calling me \u201cheartless\u201d and \u201ccold\u201d and a \u201cbitch\u201d for trying to \u201cruin his special day over a relationship that is long over\u201d. My family understands my point of view. But I feel terrible that I\u2019ve upset my daughter. I don\u2019t know what to do. AITA? Should I just put aside my feelings and take her?",

        "selftext": "Title is pretty self explanatory. But basically over the weekend, I had a work trip to go on so my sister offered to babysit my 2 year old. She\u2019s babysat him a few times so knows what to expect. Well, this time, she left her $3000 gaming laptop *on the floor* of her lounge room. She gave my son an open cup of apple juice without supervision, and he decided to use the laptop as a table on the floor. Things happen and somehow it got knocked over. Her laptop no longer switches on. She\u2019s blaming me and expects me to buy her a new one. I told her no as it shouldn\u2019t have been in his reach and certainly not on the floor. She\u2019s refusing to speak to me at the moment and said she\u2019ll never babysit for me ever again. I really don\u2019t feel as though it\u2019s my responsibility.. AITA? EDIT: Yikes this blew up. A few people have asked for more info. Yes, I packed both a straw cup and sippy cup in my sons bag. I supplied everything he\u2019d need for the weekend - including nappies and food. My parents were originally going to have him but my sister specifically asked if she could so she\u2019d be able to spend time with him. It wasn\u2019t just \u2018babysitting\u2019 but more enjoying time with her nephew. I gave her some money if she wanted to get takeout or for extra supplies and she was happy with that as \u2018payment\u2019 for watching my son. Every other time she\u2019d had him, the laptop has always been far out of reach.",

        "selftext": "I (F25) decided to become vegan at the beginning of this year, I watched Dominion and just sat there crying the whole time pretty much, so decided I can't knowingly pay for animals to be treated like that anymore. Since then I've been doing really well and I feel a lot better, I cook a lot of my own food, usually stews, curries, chilli, and various other meals. My friend and her 6 year old came round my house for a catch up. The child asked if they could have something to eat so I offered to make him a sandwich and listed off some of the options in my house, peanut butter, jam, yeast extract, etc. He asked for ham, I explained that I don't keep meat in the house as I don't eat it so I wouldn't be able to make him a ham sandwich. He then started asking me why I don't eat it, so I explained that to make ham they have to kill pigs and I don't agree with killing animals for food. He got really upset and started crying and asking his mum why she feeds him dead animals, and my friend got really annoyed at me for telling him where food comes from. They left pretty quickly and my friend texted me later on calling me all sorts of names and telling me I shouldn't push my extremist views on her child who now is refusing to eat meat.Maybe I should've just kept my mouth shut, but I feel like children have a right to know and understand what it is they're eating, and I only spoke about it because he was interested and asked me.  So AITA? I would just like to add some info that keeps coming up. All I said was exactly what was written in the post. I didn't go into graphic detail about what happens to animals. His mum was present for the entire conversation and made no input until he started crying. I would also like to add that some of you seem to think I was trying to convert this child to veganism. I'm not preachy and I don't tell people what to eat, I just answered a question honestly and maybe a little too quickly without thinking about who I was talking to.",

My niece (20F) is the only exception. She is my brother\u2018s (43M) daughter and despite her parents showing no prejudices against the LGBTQ+ community, she doesn\u2019t make a secret of her homophobia. I don\u2018t know where her believes stem from but the day I first introduced my husband/ then boyfriend to her family, she has been very hostile towards us (she was 14 at the time). She refuses to speak to my husband, barely acknowledges us at family gatherings and despite her father constantly chastising her, frequently uses the f-slur to refer to members of the LGBTQ+ community and calls same-sex relationships disgusting. Due to a severe flooding, my brother and his family have been forced to evacuate their house. My husband and I have a guest room and a sofa bed in our living room so when my brother asked we whether his family could stay at our place for a while, I told him that him, his wife and their younger children (15F, 12M) were very welcome to stay as long as they needed to, but that we weren\u2019t comfortable letting his oldest daughter stay with us.  He seemed to have been expecting that answer and told me that he understood my reasons. When he broke the news to his daughter, she was furious, asking where else she was going to stay and that she had nowhere else to go.From what I know, my brother offered to help her pay for a cheap hotel, but see doesn\u2019t want to dip into her savings because she doesn\u2019t work and she\u2018s been living with my brother rent free.  Apparently, she\u2018s been staying with a friend for a few days now and she\u2018s been telling her mother how awful it is there.

        "selftext": "I'm engaged to Noah and this was the first Christmas I spent with his family. I met them in the summer after we moved to be near his family now that he's finished with college. We're getting married in February and we're expecting our first child together in May. Being someone who has no family and seeing how close his family was, I wanted to make sure I showed my appreciation for them with the gifts I gave so I tried to get something each person would love. One of his sisters loves to read and so I made a book sleeve for her with little details from all her favorite books. One of his nieces is on the spectrum and has wanted clothes for her stuffy, so I made some clothes for her to put on the stuffy. I bought his mom a jewelry box that she had admired a couple of times after she mentioned never having a real one. For his dad I bought him a frame for his office big enough to hold photos of his whole family on, since he always complained he couldn't find one big enough or nice enough, and had no more room for individual frames. I included photos Noah had provided me in it. I got his other sister her favorite makeup which she mentioned she couldn't afford to buy lately. Then I got his brother a signed piece of memorabilia from his favorite sports team. For the rest of the nieces and nephews, I bought wish list items the parents weren't getting. Noah thought they would love everything. He told me I didn't need to go to the effort I did (I spent weeks tracking everything down and searching for certain items) but he really thought they'd like them. But when Christmas Day happened I could tell something was off. I spent the whole time worrying that I had bought them stuff they didn't like anymore or something. They said nothing. But then the next day they asked Noah what the hell I was thinking and I was like some kind of stalker buying them such personal stuff when I'm an almost stranger to them. The next day we saw them again and I apologized for the gifts I gave them and told them I would be a lot more mindful in the future. I offered to make it up to them. One of his sister's called me a stalker to my face and told me it was no wonder my family didn't want me if I was so creepy to do stuff like that. Noah yelled at her. I apologized again and told them I didn't want to hurt anyone and I would learn from this. They told me I had overstepped. Noah said we were leaving and they owed me an apology. I feel so bad. Noah is supporting me and told me I did nothing wrong. But surely there wouldn't be so much offense if that were true. I need to ask AITA? Also, not sure if this is relevant or not but I grew up in an unhappy home. My parents were unkind to me and my sister. She was much older and also hated me. I think maybe because of how our parents treated her. But I ended up with nobody who wanted me by the time I was 16 and I was homeless for a good period after that. That's what Noah's sister meant. I had told them honestly when they asked. ETA: I wanted to clarify something that might sound strange. I had spoken to them on the phone before but we had not met in person until this year. With Covid and us living in a different city at the time I had not gotten the chance. But they were genuinely all close before this. Sorry for another edit! I just wanted to clarify that we had met in person before Christmas, and more than once too, but I feel like I messed up expressing that here. I met them for the first time in the summer. Also, since people have been asking, they got me gift cards and they did not return the gifts. Just wanted to thank everyone for commenting. I am going to talk about what happened with my therapist and work on building up some more confidence in myself. I'm a work in progress. I have been in therapy for a while now but it's the first time I have been able to see a really good therapist. My history has left me with not very much belief in myself and my confidence has never been good. I never ever meant to make anyone awkward, uncomfortable or to make someone feel bad. I can see from a few comments that there are those who believe I was majorly wrong and should have known better. I didn't. It was my first Christmas with a family setting and my fiance is the only person I have shared Christmas with. But I know that what I did is not wanted by his family so I will accept that and work on being okay with that. I won't apologize again or be the try hard. Noah wants to talk to his family when he calms down but that might take a bit because he's angry and is ready to not see them again if they don't apologize. The kindness of so many people here made me cry and helped me to take some comfort in the fact I wasn't in the wrong for what I did. But I do appreciate the honesty also from people who would not like it and can see that for some it's just too much.",

        "selftext": "I wanna preface this by saying that I f34 married my husband m37 a year ago. His mom is snoopy and annoying af. She can't help it that is just how she is as my dear in laws say. My husband and I purchased a new house recently. My MIL kept pushing to get an emergency key, She promised that she only use it in an emergency but giving the fact that she had an emergency key to our old apartment and walked in on us being intimate twice (but my husband didn't think it was big deal) I just couldn't trust her so I just sent her a fake key (after she kept pushing) and she had a smug on her face after I hand delivered it to her. Days gone by and on Christmas dinner MIL angerily called me out on the fact I gave her a fake copy of the house key. She shamed me for doing this in front of everyone but in my defensive I asked her how she found out and she said days ago when she came over at 4 while my husband and were out. I reminded her didn't you promise you wouldn't use it unless there's an emergency? So You tried to get in when there was no emergency and you broke the promise you made to us! She looked red in the face and the other family started staring and some even laughed at her for the face she made. She suddenly got up from her seat and rushed into the kitchen where she had a huge meltdown so loud the next door neighbors must've heard - literally I've never heard a 60+ year old woman throw a tantrum like that. Needless to say dinner went awkward and my husband and his sister were giving me looks. My husband went off on me in the car and said I lied and manipulated and humiliated and exposed his mom and said he wouldn't have let me get away with it had he known. We had an argument and he is demanding I apologize to his mom for my childish behavior and for ruining Christmas dinner for the whole family. AITA? Eta so this went off unexpectedly and I thought I'd show my husband some pretty helpful comments I found here minutes ago but he got mad at me when he saw it and said I was nuts to talk about his family online. He demanded my phone so he could delete it but I refused and I went upstairs and into the bedroom. I never seen him so agitated and I didn't think he'd react like that honestly. But thank you guys for your support. It really means so much. I'll update if I can. Thanks again :)",

I am not comfortable with it at all especially with how hard she is pushing. She has multiple times overstepped boundaries such as inviting herself along, discussing very personal issues, very touchy etc\u2026.  Due to these issues we are not close and my own daughters are not a huge fan of her. She asked me this week if I would make the cookie table for the wedding. It is something the brides own mother would do with other female relatives. This is the first time hearing about this tradition and I did some research. I would have to make over a thousand cookies from scratch to feed the wedding guest. I asked my daughters if they wanted to do it and it was a strong no. I informed her that I can not do it, it is way to much work and I don\u2019t have the time. She told me okay and I thought that was it. My son called me up and told me I am a huge jerk. That Wendy has been crying about it and I should step up. I am still refusing to do it. AITA? Edit: common questions Did DIL tell me the number: Yes she stated 1000-1200 What about fmaily helping: she isn\u2019t close to her family so her side is out, my parents are in a home, I am an only child. My husband has a sister and I doubt she wants to help. Daughter don\u2019t wish to, so it would basically be me ",

        "selftext": "WIBTA for not attending my twin brothers surprise birthday dinner when I am only invited as a guest  Would I be the asshole for not attending a surprise birthday dinner for my twin brother  So I\u2019m a twin, my brother and I hang out all the time and we are super close. In a few days its our (25m) birthday. We share the same friend group and we\u2019re all really close and have been since school. He has a close group of girl friends (about 5 of them) who I have also known for many years, I would class them as being closer with him in recent years but we are all still good friends and socialise often together.  Now, I have been added to a group chat labeled \u201c*my brothers name* surprise dinner!\u201d It is a surprise birthday dinner for my twin brother organised by one of the girls in that group and they have invited me as a guest. One of them also said in the group that it would \u201cbe nice to see me as well\u201d so I just feel like an afterthought. I wouldn\u2019t really have minded if the girls wanted to organise a surprise birthday evening exclusively for my brother and themselves but they have also invited my partner and some of my brother and I\u2019s closest friends. This feels inconsiderate and quite upsetting as I can\u2019t understand why I would be invited to my literal twin brothers surprise birthday dinner with me only invited as a guest as it is also my birthday involving all of our friends. My girlfriend also found this action to be extremely rude and wondered why this girl didn\u2019t just reach out to her and then they could have organised a surprise involving both of us instead or have just involved both my brother and I and left the surprise element out of it.  In the chat it is clearly stated that we are all to arrive at one time while my brother is due to arrive 20 minutes later. The thought of attending makes me feel weird because it\u2019s just a celebration for \u201chis\u201d birthday when him and I are literally born on the same day. This isn\u2019t new information to the organiser. Also, every year my brother and I do something together because we want to and because we have the same friends, last year our friends and my girlfriend set up a massive dinner for our birthday to which everyone was invited, including the girl group.  So now I\u2019m at a crossroads. I don\u2019t know whether or not to attend. On one hand, if I don\u2019t go I will feel left out because our mutual friends are going. But on the other hand if I do go, I will feel like I am letting myself be disrespected and I will likely feel uncomfortable as it feels like only my brother is being celebrated. So, WIBTA if I took a stand and didn\u2019t go? EDIT: my girlfriend has just checked the chat and the organiser has booked the dinner for 10 people and a set menu. There are currently 11 attending excluding my girlfriend and I. If we went, this would make it way over capacity. Now we *really* aren\u2019t sure if we should go because what if we turn up and there is no room? This makes it slightly more awkward as we may not be able to just pull up a chair and join? The dinner is tomorrow also.  Thanks for all the kind messages as well, I will definitely give an update after everything plays out (Edit: I have posted an update to my profile as my character count was too long) [UPDATE](https://www.reddit.com/user/_somethingorrather/comments/1367ffb/update_wibta_for_not_attending_my_twin_brothers/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1)",

The issue is they always want to split the check. I have had the conversation so many times that I want to pay for what I ordered. It results in an argument where I have to bend or everyone is mad at me. I also make a lot more then my friends so it always result in them basically calling me cheap. They don\u2019t get I want to pay for my meal and that is it.  Anyways we went out to eat yesterday and they all ordered things that were around 30 dollars, I got the house salad and my total was around 12. They told the server to split the bill and I didn\u2019t want to fight about it again. I asked the server to add on to the bill an entree and dessert for me to take home. This resulted in my bill going up into the 30s. So they asks me what I was doing, I told them I am getting more food, they got upset they I increased the price they needed to pay. This resulted in another argument and they think I am a jerk. Edit: Reddit I\u2019ve done everything you have suggested, I have had the server take mine out and I pay for it, I have spoken to them. If I do anything that isn\u2019t splitting the bill with them they get pissed",

        "selftext": "My friend [25F] is constantly late for everything. Be it work-related or fun activities, she will always be at least 15-20 minute late. She does not have a car, and so oftentimes I [25M] will pick her up from her house (I work at a university and she is a PhD student there, and her place is along the way for me).  Last time I offered her a ride to work, she ended up being 20 minutes late after I've already arrived at her place. Because of that, I ended up being late for work. She is always very apologetic about her lateness, but never changes. This week she was supposed to give a seminar at the university which is a crucial part of her PhD program. She asked me if I could give her a ride to work that day. I told her sure, but that I was picking her up at 8 AM and she must be there exactly at 8 AM, and not a minute later. She chuckled, but I told her I wasn't joking, and she promised that she will be there.  The morning of her seminar, I drove to her place and got there at 7:55, and texted her that I was here, and she told me should would be out in just a minute. At 8:00, there was no indication that she would come out (and she didn't text anything), so at 8:01, I drove off.  At around 8:20, she called me asking me where I was. I told her I was at work and that I wasn't joking when I told her that she had to be ready right that minute. She started screaming and crying over the phone, and told me that she was having a hard time that morning couldn't be ready right at 8 AM. She then begged me to come back to pick up her, as her seminar is at 9 AM and she needed to be at the school before then. I could've done it quick enough to pick her up and drop her off without affecting my work, but I decided I didn't want to do that, and told her that I won't.  She was crying and hyperventilating at that point and said she'd promise to never be late for anything else again, and reemphasized that this seminar was crucial for her PhD and that she absolutely cannot miss it without severe consequence. I responded oh well, and hung up. I then went about my day at work normally.  I feel like could've went back and picked her up in this scenario since it wouldn't have been detrimental to me and at the same time this was something very important for her. On the other hand, I feel like this should be a wake-up call for her chronic lateness. EDIT: thank you everyone for the kind words. To answer a few common questions:Yes, she did miss her seminar and apparently got into big trouble with the school. I don't think it's going to ruin her PhD, but there definitely are consequences. Regarding our friendship, it was already on its way out when this happened, and now we haven't talked at all for a while.",

        "selftext": "My (54M) daughter (19F) is living with me this summer before heading to college later this month. She spent the majority of her middle and high school years at her moms due to divorce custody arrangements. My daughter had knee surgery at the end of July to fix a torn ACL. As a result, I\u2019ve been with her a lot helping her recover (food, icing, transportation, etc).  Last week, I noticed in the hallway bathroom that she uses, that there were tampon \u201ccovers/wraps \u201d (I don\u2019t know the official name). The next time I checked on her I asked her to confirm that she was throwing her tampons away and not flushing them.She said No, they get flushed down the toilet. She said I should be kind of embarrassed that I have a 19yo daughter and don\u2019t even realize that.I told her No they don\u2019t. I reminded her of all the doctor office and hospital bathrooms where reminder notes are left asking women not to flush their feminine hygiene products. At the same time as I said that, she finished looking on her phone and I could tell she found information on-line that confirmed the garbage is the correct disposal method. I asked her to please use the garbage from now on. Later that night, I sent her two different Internet searches, confirming not to put tampons down the toilet, and instead to put them in the garbage.  Several days later, when I was checking on her, I asked her if she was using the garbage for her tampons. She said No. I reminded her what we talked about and what I had asked her to do. She said I didn\u2019t understand, since I was a man.I told her, yes, I am a man and yes, I don\u2019t understand. However, millions of American women have figured it out.  I asked her if she had googled how to dispose of bloody tampons?She said I\u2019m not going to Google that.I asked her if she had thought about using plastic bags to wrap her tampons in, or using something like that.She said again that I wouldn\u2019t understand what it\u2019s like to dispose of a bloody tampon. I agreed with her again. I said it sounds like you are not willing to try or learn something new in order to do it differently. I told her if that was the case then she could pay the plumber bill if I ever needed to call the plumber to come fix a clogged drain line due to a tampon. She basically gave up and said Fine.As I was leaving she said that I was being \u201cjust like mom\u201d.  AITA? PS - I know how this sub works, so expecting some questions. I\u2019m driving for the next four hours and won\u2019t be able to reply until much later. Judge away! Edit 1 - stopped at Pilot rest stop. Going to respond to just a few questions In the USA There is a garbage can in bathroom. Directly underneath the toilet paper (both in arms reach of the toilet) No lid on trash can. Thanks for suggesting. Edit 2 - when my daughter says I\u2019m just like her mother, I think that is meant to be a \u201cyou\u2019ve said the rule and regardless of what I say you aren\u2019t going to change your mind.  You won\u2019t listen to me and change your view\u201d Also, I think her issue with me is that I couldn\u2019t understand what it\u2019s like to deal with the bloody tampon since I\u2019m a man. Edit 3 - Thanks for all the input!I'll ask my daughter about a covered garbage can in the bathroom as well as gloves and/or small plastic bags.No dogs in the house.",

        "selftext": "My 10 year old daughter wanted bangs for a long time because a friend of her's recently had her hair cut and had bangs cut and it ended up being very cute. My daughter has beautiful hair, it's very long, but it's thin. I had my cousin, who is a hairdresser who actually has an area of focus on kids haircuts, consult and she said that if we cut bangs into my daughter's hair it wouldn't look right due to how thin her hair is. I normally let my daughter have a say in the choices she makes regarding clothes and hair but on this one I put my foot down because I know it won't look good and she is going to wind up unhappy. My cousin also uploaded a photo of my daughter to FaceApp and showed me what she would look like with bangs and it just wasn't a good look (I know FaceApp isn't 100% accurate but it was pretty close in this regard). Day before yesterday my daughter told me she was going to take some alone time in our bathroom. It was only after she'd been in the bathroom a while that I noticed the scissors I keep in the kitchen were missing. These are big meat scissors. And then I heard her in the bathroom crying so I made her open the door and she was hunkered with her back to me, sobbing, and I saw a hunk of hair in the sink. She had watched a TikTok compilation of people cutting their hair and tried to do bangs! It was not good results. The hair doesn't lay flat, she cut very unevenly, and she cut too short (using your index finger place the tip in the center part and go down to the first bend and that's how short she cut). I really didn't know what to say so I made sure hadn't hurt herself with the scissors, which she didn't. I looked at her hair, realized I wasn't going to be able to even it up myself, so I called my cousin, who came over and made the cut even but it required cutting shorter, and now her hair is fucked up. My daughter is mortified and doesn't want to go into public now. She keeps begging me to fix it even though I've explained to her, and my cousin explained it can't be fixed. So I told her, this is what happens when you don't listen. You made the mistake yourself. You hid in the bathroom because you knew it was wrong. You have to live with the consequences and wait for it to grow. My husband says I'm being very cold and unsympathetic and that our daughter is 10, she didn't know any better, she was just learning and doing what kids do. I feel that she knew exactly what she was doing and that it was wrong, hence her hiding from me. My husband said that if I had just taken her to the salon and had her hair cut then she wouldn't have done it herself. My daughter hates the bangs, says my cousin was right that it wouldn't look good so if I had taken her to get it done then she'd be blaming me. We're at a stalemate. AITA? EDIT: why is everyone focusing on me when she asked my husband for bangs as well and he said no? He told her he didn't think it would look good. He could have also easily taken her to the salon.",

        "selftext": "AITA? Hello. So to give some context, I f35 have been married to my husband, m37 for 6 months. He has 2 children from two different (uninvolved) mothers and they live with us full time. The kids are 7y.o. And 10y.o. I work long hours and it's a demanding job time wise. My husband thinks that just because I wfh that I can pause whenever but it's untrue. He'd ask me to do things for the kids or him during work hours, but I told him I'm working and unavailable during those hours, and that the kids are his responsibilty til I'm done. Yesterday, He told me he wanted to go attend a friend's engagement dinner and asked if I could take time off work to make the kids dinner. I told him absolutely not, and insisted that he cook for them or order takeout. He said he had no time to cook, and takeout was off the table since he doesn't want them to eat fast food. He later said fine and that he was going to cook dinner then go to the party. 2hrs later, the kids came in and said they were hungry. I was puzzled, I asked if their dad cooked them dinner and they said he didn't. Moreover!!! He told them to come ask me to cook for them at exactly 7pm. I was so pissed to find myself in this situation. I took few minutes off the meeting and ordered takeout from the nearby restaurant and fed the kids, then had them watch tv then go to sleep. He came home at 11PM and went off on me after he discovered that I didn't cook like he was counting on me to do. Not only that, but he yelled about feeding the kids takeout. I argued back saying I had no choice after he basically tricked me into cooking for them knowing I was busy, so I ordered food and made sure the kids were fed while I focused on work. He ranted about how I care more about work than my stepchildren (God forbid) and called me selfish then went upstairs and refused to talk to me. He's still sulking about it today and says I need to get my priorities in order cause they're messed up. Info - About that friend's engagement. My husband has this friend from college. They're close and he couldn't miss the event. Moreover, he said he was upset with me for missing the event and now refusing to cook a homemade healthy meal and ordering takeout knowing it's a no go for him. Info - The reason I expected him to cook other than the fact that I was busy, was that he usually cooks for them so it's both of our responsibility. Info - Does he work? Yes, but barely. He works at a warehouse only twice a week. His friend's dad owns the warehouse and do he has a lot of leverage. Info - More context on the mothers. One is an ex wife, the other is an ex girlfriend. Both left for financial reasons he said but I'm not fully convinced by that.",

        "selftext": " My husband (m33)s best friend (m37) Will is infertile. He got divorced 2 times because of it and because he lied and hid his infertility. And his life hasn't been the same the day he was told he can't have kids. He has always had a soft spot for children and when he found out that my husband and I are expecting, he was so thrilled and started buying us gifts and decore pieces that he made from his woodwork for the baby. My husband thinks that those are all nice gestures but I couldn't help but feel uncomfortable especially with how much he keeps mentioing the baby. A few days ago, my husband and I found the gender of the baby. The minute we told Will, he started calling the baby a random name he picked and was going to give to his baby if he wasn't infertile. He then started begging us to use this name and my husband said it was a done deal. I refused but my husband called me heartless and asked me to do this one small, nice gesture for his struggling friend to give him closure and honor him after all the things he has done for us. I flipped and said it's my baby not his. Will heard this and left immediately. My husband yelled at me saying it's his baby too and my behavior towards Will was abhorant. He left after him and didn't come back til the morning. He kept saying the same thing and pressuring me to agree on the name but I refused. AITA for choosing this hill to die on?",

        "selftext": "I (24f) have been dating \u201cBen\u201d (26M) for eight months. For context, Ben and I are from different income brackets, and Ben has expressed that he sometimes feels a little bit weird about this because he is a gentleman at heart but he says it\u2019s hard to treat me since I\u2019m not really impressed by his gestures. I\u2019ve said many times that I\u2019m not concerned about these kind of things either way, but it comes up periodically. Last night Ben and I went to dinner with 6 of my friends. There were 3 men in total and 5 women. At the end of the dinner the two guys \u201cMax\u201d and \u201cHarry\u201d said they would get the bill, as the guys usually do when we\u2019re out. Ben quietly said to me that he wasn\u2019t really comfortable with the guys paying for his dinner so I said I\u2019d chip in with the bill. Ben said thank you but could he chip in and then I could pay him back afterwards because he didn\u2019t want them to know I was paying.  This struck me as totally absurd because firstly, it\u2019s an unnecessary step, second even split the cost was something I wasn\u2019t sure he would realistically be able to cover, and third I felt like he was trying to enter a pissing contest with my friends which was just childish.  I said no I would just pay and then turned to everyone and said I\u2019d chip in a third of the bill. No one batted an eyelid, but Ben was sulking.  He\u2019s now mad at me saying I emasculated him and made him look bad in front of my friends. I think he\u2019s overdramatising it because my friends couldn\u2019t care less and he needs to get over himself.  Am I in the wrong for not letting him \u201csave face\u201d?",

        "selftext": "I (25F) am getting married May of next year. I\u2019m currently planning the reception and I have already secured a venue. I was having a discussion with my fianc\u00e9 (27F) about possible food options (catering or cooking, what types of food, buffet style or served, etc.) and my mother (60F) and one of my aunts (56F) were visiting. They threw in some thoughts and advice, as they\u2019ve had weddings, which I really appreciate. The topic of drinking came up, and my aunt asked what kind of cocktails we\u2019d be serving. I told her we wouldn\u2019t be serving alcohol at the wedding. She was shocked and asked what everyone was going to drink. I told her there would be water, sweet tea, lemonade, fruit-punch, and soda available. My aunt said that having soda was a bad idea because it\u2019s so unhealthy, and so is sweet tea and overly sugary lemonade and fruit-punch. I told her if was so concerned about sugar content she could stick with water, and we\u2019re planning on having plenty of fresh fruit she could add to it. We\u2019d also have unsweet tea for my diabetic family members, or they\u2019re welcome to request or bring a desirable alternative. She asked why alcohol couldn\u2019t be a request. I told her I simply didn\u2019t want to serve any at my wedding. My fianc\u00e9 and I would be financially responsible for the purchase (and alcohol would frankly be out of our budget) and we would feel responsible for their actions. She asked if she and the other drinkers of the family could bring their own beer and said it really wouldn\u2019t be a party without one. I said no, again, because it\u2019s my wedding and fianc\u00e9 and I would feel responsible for drunk guests. We also want to have a wedding that\u2019s fun and happy because everyone there loves each other and is happy to celebrate their family/our union. She said it was already a shame I wasn\u2019t getting married in a church and the least I could do was make up for it with a good reception. I told her if she can\u2019t go one evening without drinking then maybe she\u2019s the one with a problem. At this point my mom jumped in and told me I need to apologize, I said no, I don\u2019t appreciate how my aunt has spoken to me and she needs to leave. They ended up going, but then my aunt complained the next day on Facebook about my \u201cdry wedding\u201d and said she wasn\u2019t going to torture herself driving an hour and a half to my venue just to have a bad time. She also explained how the conversation went the day before and said I called her a drunk for being healthy. I\u2019ve been getting a lot of messages, some supportive, some on the fence, and some very angry that I want to \u201cruin a good reception by acting like it\u2019s the prohibition era\u201d. I\u2019m honestly confused here, am I the asshole? Edit: my aunt\u2019s health comment wasn\u2019t about beer, it was about wine. She believes a glass a day is important for maintaining health and she drinks at least one glass every single day. She\u2019s also hopped on the intermittent fasting trend, so I take her \u201chealth advice\u201d with a grain of salt. Especially since she probably meets the medical threshold for alcoholism.  Also, another reason I don\u2019t want alcohol is because this is a specifically kid friendly event. I want my little cousins and nieces/nephews and my fianc\u00e9\u2019s younger family members to be able to attend. I don\u2019t feel comfortable hosting an all-ages event with lots of alcohol and drunk adults present. A lot of my family members do not behave when they\u2019re drunk. EDIT 2: For those saying I should make the \u201cdry\u201d part clear in advance, I planned on having the entire food and drink situation for the wedding figured out and announced six months before the date. I wasn\u2019t going to spring it on people last minute. Everyone was going to be informed and then further reminded on the Save-The-Date\u2019s and the invites! I\u2019m also not anti-alcohol or something. I like drinking, there are just too many concerning factors and liabilities with allowing it at my wedding, including the incredibly expensive cost of providing the alcohol. Edit 3: To everyone suggesting a cash bar, that would invariably make this situation worse. My relatives expect me to provide alcohol for free. If I tell them they have to pay they will complain more. One of my uncles was arrested last year because the price of his favorite brand of beer went up and he stole his next 12-pack because \u201che deserved it after how much money he gave to that company\u201d. He still thinks the cops and the store were in the wrong. Edit 4: Very tired of people not reading or simply ignoring what I\u2019ve already made clear and twisting my words. I\u2019ve explained my case. Most of you agree with me. I am done responding to comments and explaining/answering questions.",

        "selftext": "I\u2019m the dad of a 25 year old young woman who I love very much. I\u2019ve been able to have a good relationship with my daughter and I enjoy my time with her, but there\u2019s one thing about her that would give many people pause - she is a diagnosed sociopath. She exhibited odd, disturbing behavior at a young age, and after a serious incident of abuse towards her younger sister, I realized she needed professional help. Throughout her elementary years she struggled heavily, getting in lots of trouble in school for lying, cruelty and all other types of misbehaviors. With an enormous amount of therapy & support, her bad behavior was minimized as she grew older. She received an ASPD diagnosis at 18, and I had suspected it for long prior. After her aggressive behavior was tamed, her following years were much more fruitful. She\u2019s law-abiding; has a decent job and a good education; and has many good friendships and admirers. Especially male admirers; she is very, very charming and adept at attracting guys and maintaining their interest. She uses that old dating guide \u201cThe Rules\u201d like a Bible. She currently has a boyfriend of about a year and a half who\u2019s crazy about her, and who I have a very strong relationship with (we live in the same area and spend time together regularly). He is a **great** guy, very kind, funny and intelligent. But I doubt she loves him. We\u2019ve had some very honest, in-depth discussions about her mental health since her diagnosis, and she\u2019s been open with me that she doesn\u2019t feel love or empathy towards anyone, even family. When she acted very sad and broken up over the death of one of her closest friends at the funeral, she confessed to me privately that it was all a put-on, and that she felt \u201cpretty neutral\u201d about the whole thing. She has also stated she has never once felt guilty about anything she\u2019s ever done, and doesn\u2019t know what guilt feels like. While she enjoys being around her boyfriend and is sexually attracted to him, I highly doubt she feels much of anything towards him love-wise. Her boyfriend (who might propose soon) **has** **no idea** about her diagnosis, and she\u2019s been very upfront with me that she has no plans to ever tell him, thinking it\u2019ll scare him away. I\u2019ve made it clear to her that she needs to tell him the truth before they marry; that he has the right to know and consider it; **or I will**; to which she always responds, \u201cI know you wouldn\u2019t dare.\u201d I actually would - I really like and respect this young man, and would feel awful keeping this \u201csecret\u201d from him, and letting him walk into a marriage without this piece of knowledge. I\u2019m not trying to sabotage my daughter\u2019s future. **Maybe** her boyfriend\u2019s love of her personality and other aspects is enough that it won\u2019t end the relationship. It\u2019s his decision to make; but he deserves all the facts. Someday he\u2019s bound to find out she\u2019s a bit \u201coff\u201d; it can\u2019t be kept a secret forever. AITA?",

Their father left after Cassie was born, no family nearby, etc. I have 2 sitters that I can call on as needed and I use them before I\u2019d ever ask Polly for help. I don\u2019t want her missing out on her teenage years. Before this incident, I only ever asked her to babysit once because I had no one else and I paid her $15/hr (at the time, above minimum wage).  This past Saturday, Polly was due to hang out with some friends. For a couple of days, Trevor was ill, but testing negative for Covid. That day, he spiked a very high fever and I had to take him to the ER. I asked Polly to watch Cassie as the sitters weren\u2019t responding. I apologized that she\u2019d have to miss out on time with friends but said I\u2019d pay her and she could even have her friends over our place. Polly pitched a fit and asked why I couldn\u2019t send Cassie to the neighbors. We don\u2019t know them. They moved in last month and outside waving when we get our mail, I don\u2019t have a relationship with them.  Polly was irritated. I told her I\u2019d pay her $18/hr and that I had to go.  I take Trevor to the ER and we have to wait a bit. Polly kept asking if the sitters responded and they hadn\u2019t. Eventually it was our time to be seen, so I told Polly i\u2019d be out of reach for a bit. Turns out, Trevor had a bad case of RSV and due to pre-existing health problems, had to be admitted for the night. I was terrified. When I called Polly to update her, I heard people talking in the background and said \u201coh, you had your friends come over?\u201d She told me no, she dropped Cassie at the neighbor\u2019s and went out. I was furious. I told her to go home and get her sister. I then asked for the neighbor\u2019s number, she didn\u2019t even ask for it. Which, I get teenage logic but still. At first Polly refused until I told her she was grounded. I made her FaceTime me when she got home to show that Cassie was with her. Eventually, my mom was able to make the 2 hour drive down to stay with the girls but I told her to not let Polly leave the house. The next day, Trevor and I were able to go home. I lectured Polly about what she did and grounded her for 2 weeks. She got mad at me and said that I can\u2019t expect her to drop her plans. I point out I never do, but this was an emergency and her brother was sick. She told me that\u2019s not her problem. She\u2019s also mad because I won\u2019t pay her. I apologized profusely to the neighbor who said it was okay and that he would\u2019ve called me but Polly didn\u2019t leave my number either. Polly said I overreacted. AITA?",

        "selftext": "I have a wife (Wilhelma, 40) and two sons (Sam, 17, and Scott, 16).  6 years ago, I ran to the gas station to buy some cigarettes.  Instead of abandoning my family (just a joke) I decided to also buy a lottery ticket for everyone, just for fun.  It was a blast.  We all talked all night about what we would do with our winnings, where we would go, etc.  I mean, this was all fantasy anyway, right?  But I specifically told my kids that they would have to share their winnings, and they would have to put it away for college first and foremost.  Well wouldn't you know it, Sams ticket won.  Of course its actually MY ticket, and I had to claim it.  It didn't win the jackpot, but after taxes we walked away with $60k.  I sat them both down and explained that I was going to save it all for college, but we could celebrate/splurge a little.  They absolutely wanted a gaming system, and Wilhelma insisted on a family vacation that was much needed.  We all agreed on this, and saving the rest.  I bought the gaming system and a bunch of games for about $1k.  Wilhelma took over the vacation and insisted on a Disney World trip.  The boys don't even like Disney, but it was always Wilhelma's dream to go so we went.  Another $5k.  Last year, Sam wanted a car.  Wilhelma was pretty tired of chauffeuring them around anyway, so I agreed and spent his $4k on a car.  I pay the insurance, registration, and maintenance under the agreement that he takes over driving Scott to his stuff as well.  Wilhelma had no complaints about any of these purchases.    Since day 1, I've actually invested the entire winnings and never dipped into it.  I've always spent my OWN money on all this stuff.  I have invested better than average, and that $60k is now $100k.  Wilhelma knows I have always invested our money, but it was always small amounts since we're poor.  She knows I was investing the lottery winnings as well.  I've always told her about the money doing well, but I guess I never explicitly said how well.  She also has never asked, as she has left our finances completely up to me.    Sam is starting college in a few weeks, and we figured out a plan to stretch his $30k over the 4 years.  While looking at the portfolio, Wilhelma noticed it was at $100k and asked how.  I told her I invested the $60k and grew it to $100k.  She then asked why we're only giving Sam $30K when it should be $50k.  I said no, the other $40k is mine.  I managed this account, I made the investments, I did all of the work.  Plus I paid for all that other stuff through our other savings. The $40k stays and I'll keep investing it.  If the boys NEED the money, its there, but if not I'm gonna eventually retire a little early with it.  She thinks I'm stealing his money since I wouldn't have been able to invest with it if I didn't have it to begin with.  I say its always kinda been my money, and I'm still giving him the $30k I promised him since the beginning.",

        "selftext": "My daughter (16F) has been vegan for about a year. Me, my husband and her brother (14M) have tried to be as supportive as possible.  We aren't a family that eats meat daily, so it wasn't that hard for me to accommodate her. When I do cook meat, I also make something else for her and keep the side dishes common for all. She does have some seperate dishes, but most are common and I clean it if I have to cook for her.  Few months into the vegan lifestyle, she tried to convince us to go vegan and would get increasingly angry when we said no. Me and husband shut that behaviour down hard and told her that she can follow whatever diet she wanted, but she cannot expect others to. She sulked for a while, but stopped doing that.  Last weekend, I cooked the family a big pot of chilli (a small vegan one and a large beef one), so that I can refrigerate it and use for the next week. Next day, I found the fridge empty of both the chilli and turns out, my daughter decided that we were are being too callous about meat. She felt the smell was too much when she opened the fridge door and that she can't anything from the fridge after that without gagging or puking. She told me that I need to throw out all the vegan food in the fridge and restock them.  Me and my husband were livid. Wasting food is never okay with us and that was a lot of food. I told her I am going to continue using the vegan products in the fridge and she can either eat it or not, but I am not wasting food. That whole week she kept making faces at dinner while she ate.  As a punishment, I gave her the recipe and told her she needs to buy them and cook it next weekend. She yelled and begged, but I stood firm. In the end, she did it.  When the cooking was finished, I told her that wasting food is never okay in this house and pointed out that instead of x amount of meat being used, 2x amount of meat (Since this seems to be confusing. I meant as in x amount in the pot she wasted + x amount in the new one. I didn't purposefully make her put more than what was used previously) was used because she threw the food away.  Now, she started crying and yelling at me about how awful and disgusting I was because I not only forced her buy meat (which she is very much against), I also forced her to cook it and now I am also telling her that it was her fault.  She is really upset about this. So, I am wondering if I went too far. Should I have picked a different punishment? My husband and brother definitely think what I did was right while my parents thinks I was in the wrong.  I thought I will put it to a vote. AITA?",

When my son proposed, we talked to both he and his fiancee to find out their game plans for the future. We wanted to buy them a house but one question decided *how big*: do they plan on having children? Their answer was yes, so we did buy them a house, but kept it in our name. Because they were common-law at this point and not yet married, we worried what if they broke their engagement: if the house was in my son's name for example, she would be entitled to some of it. At least in our names, our family is protected. We think the world of his fiancee, this was just a devil's advocate, worst case scenario thing. They've been engaged for two years and the wedding is coming up this October. But we were hit by a bombshell a couple of weeks ago that they no longer have any desire to have children. This is fine: we don't expect or assume anything, if they don't have kids, it's their life, we don't respect them any less for it. But it made my husband a little tiffed that we specifically bought them a big house under that assumption. We would have bought them a smaller 2+1 bedroom or thereabouts if they planned on being childfree. But instead we were told children are in their future so we bought them a 5 bedroom home. This is like the difference of a factor of two. We spent our money needlessly. I'm pushing my husband to sell the house because it's in our name still. My husband says it will create a rift between families but this whole thing was based on misinformation. I don't think they did it with malice hehe we get a bigger house if we lie, but I think they knew they didn't want children. You don't be in a relationship for 8 years and don't have that conversation, right? Would I be the asshole for selling their home? We'd get them a smaller one, of course, we just don't think they'll need anything bigger. They'd never be homeless. **EDIT** Just so it's clear, we don't mind or care if they have children or not. The problem is they have a larger house we bought specifically for a family. Children need extra space. Now that it's out of the question, they can make due with a smaller house. Our other son is married to a wonderful man and we bought him a house, too. Same kind of scenario as this, they got a 2+1 bedroom house. In our names until they got married, then transferred to their name once married. This is how we're giving our two children wedding gifts. There's already been hubbub between my children why does x get a 5 bedroom home when we only got a 2 bedroom, etc. Because they're having children can't be our reasoning anymore.",

He can be quite rude and make backhanded comments about me and the family sometimes which is bothersome but my sister says he's not malicious but is just the brutally honest time and we should get used to it. I visited my parents house to celebrate my sister's birthday and my husband couldn't come with me because he was busy, after the party we all sat down for dinner and my sister's boyfriend said it was weird that my husband and I don't have kids despite being married for 6 years now, I was shocked that he brought this up but I gave a short answer stating that it's because of infertility issues, he asked on which side and I didn't wanna answer but my sister said it's on my side. I got uncomfortable as he looked at me for a second and said that maybe not having kids now is a good thing because he thought women over 30 might produce defective babies due to age. I told him it was none of his business but he said that he was just giving his honest opinion and that's all. I, in return, told him while maintaining eye contact: trust me, if I wanted an asshole's opinion, I would've farted!. Literally everyone at the table bursted into laughter and my sister and her boyfriend were stunned. Few seconds later her boyfriend excused himself out and my sister followed then sent me a text after they left saying I was mean and disrespectful towards her boyfriend and insulted him maliciously just cause he stated his honest opinion, she also said I ruined her birthday by being petty and making her boyfriend the joke of the night infront of the family. I didn't respond but she demanded an apology via mail as soon as possible, mom agreed that I shouldn't have said what I said and should've just ignored him knowing how he is. I think AITA but I'm not sure.",

        "selftext": " I f31 have been with my boyfriend m37 for 8 months. He has 3 kids and is a single dad. We're on pretty good terms regarding almost everything. When it comes to money and spending, we'd take turns to invite each other out weekly (we don't live together obviously). Several times he had me pay for his kids purchases. I didn't make a big issue out of it for the sole reason that those purchases were relatively small, all I had to pay was $30-60. The other day, he called me while I was at work and sounded like he was in a hurry. He said he just found the gaming device he's been looking for for so long and wanted to buy it for his oldest son. I asked what's this have to do with me, and he told me he was short on money and needed $300. He asked me to lend him the $300 and I hesitated but agreed. He asked for my bank account info so he could pull the money but I refused and told him to wait for me til I get there. He insisted and said he'd handle it, all I had to do was just send him my bank account info after I end the call with him. His insistence made me uncomfortable so I still said no and told him to either wait or I won't pay. He got mad at me saying he didn't get why I was acting like this. He got so loud I had to hung up. I found him sitting outside after I went home. He was waiting for me and was extremely upset. He asked why I didn't just send him the account info so he could pull the money we agreed on. I told him I don't feel comfortable letting anyone have my personal info especially when it comes to finances . He got offended and said I'M NOT JUST ANYONE, I'M YOUR F'ING PARTNER!! Then went on a rant about how he ended up not paying the gaming device after looking for it for so long and now his kid is mad at him and it's my fault. We had a fight then he left and told me I'd better have an apology for him AND his son next time I call his phone. .....I haven't call yet but I feel like I acted stupidly and irrationally. I think I should've just given him the info he asked for?.,,I don't know if I made the right decision. **UPDATE:** Wow so, I've left this thread after the first hour but got back to hundreds of people engaging...Wow I'm just amazed. And since many of you wanted to know what happened, I've went to his place and talked to him and his oldest son, turns out that the gaming device thing was a lie. He wanted the money for something else, to help pay for one of his buddies car repair. I was shocked when he confessed and said he had to lie and make it about his kids to get me to lend him the money. You can only imagine my reaction after this, I just blew up at him and left without giving him any chance to respond. He tried calling my phone (still trying) but I decided I want some space to think about what happened and really re-evaluate our relationship. It's true that he had me pay for the kids in the past but after what I found I wouldn't put it past him that those $30-60 purchases weren't for the kids as I haven't seen the stuff he said he bought for them. I'm in need of some space and quiet though I'm busy with work but I do my best to stay focused. I, quite frankly am no longer sure if I could move past this....it's just so unsettling that he has no issue lying to me and USING me for money like that. I love the kids, I ADORE thrm but him? He's hurt me with what I did and I'm not sure I could come back from it. I might just be upset right now and will need time...I don't know....yeah...I'm just going to do a lot of thinking regarding this situation and see what happens. Sorry for the long text but I wanted to let you know about the situation  as a whole.",

My kids don't get along super well, Dax thinks pranksare really funny, I guess like every 12 year old boy, and he annoys Mia with them a lot. It's something my husband and I have been working on as it's the source of many fights between them.  Dax gets a lot of prank ideas from YouTube and TikTok and will often recreate what he sees. Most of them are harmless (something like a fake spider in her food etc.), but this time I think he went too far. Dax thought it would be funny to put Saran Wrap over the toilet before my daughter went to the bathroom. He says he got the idea from online? Idk if this is a thing but it's a terrible prank. Basically he put plastic wrap under the toilet seat so if someone sits on it, well pretty much it makes a mess instead of going in the bowl. Yeah I know, ew.  So he does this right before Mia goes in the bathroom to pee. When she gets in there she sits on the seat like normal, pees, and since there's plastic wrap over the hole, her pee collects on it and gets everywhere, all around the ground on the toilet and on her.  She comes to me crying. She's embarrassed because she's a teenage girl and this is... disgusting. I told Mia to shower and not worry about the mess.  Here's where I might be TA... I go to my Son and yell at him for what he did. I tell him that's not an appropriate prank and he's old enough to know that's not okay. And then I made him clean in up.  He started crying saying it's unfair I make him clean his sisters pee. It's gross and he's going to be sick. He says it's from her body so she should clean it. But it was all his fault and literally his mess to deal with, I don't know why I should humiliate my daughter further or why I should have to clean it. And biggest thing, he needs to learn.  I told him the mess was his fault and he should think about the repercussions of his actions next time, because this is what his prank caused. And then I stood in the doorway and watched as I made him clean all of the urine off the floor and toilet.  I think it was an appropriate punishment considering it's really just the natural consequence of what he did, and it doubles as a general lesson in how to clean a toilet which he has to learn at some point anyway.  Well my husband disagrees. This all happened while he was at work, and after he got home Dax complained to him.  He told me I was overly harsh on our son and put him in danger by exposing him to germs. But I gave him the same gloves I use when I have to wash the toilet and it's not like he was unsupervised.  But my husband is mad at me and told me I want too far and that's bad parenting. Of course my son is mad at me too. But my daughter is on my side.  AITA? Am I a bad Mom?",

This acc is just for privacy reasons -I always had good grades in high-school, was home on time, cleaned the house etc. I never had problems with my parents before this.  -I went to med school, still living with parents when I was 20, I dated someone who was 23 -Dad was against this because be does not believe in dating people far older than you (so like don't date far from your own age)  and says I cannot date J.  -Argument breaks out, Dad says it's his house so either I agree or I move out. I say it's not fair as J has a job, goes to college, has future plans etc. Dad kicks me out. Mom agrees with his decision. Little bro was only 14 at the time.  -I moved with J, his family was supportive, helped me with my college (I went to another college due to financial reasons), finished my required years but still kept in touch with my lil bro -Years later, me and J (with the help of his parents) got a small house. (Like really small but I'm happy with it). I ended up giving birth to a sweet baby girl. I let my lil bro know that he could come see her when he was able to.  He came a few times.  -Today, bro came to see the baby, and asked when I was going to let mom and dad see her since they wanted to reconnect. I said never and that I wasn't going to forgive them. Bro says I'm being unreasonable as they were just strict and trying to protect me, I say that's bullshit because Dad shouldn't have kicked me out over age. Bro says I should at least let Mom come because she didn't want to agree with it. I say Mom was able to do something but didn't,but that Bro's situation was different because he was only 15. Bro is upset because he says Mom and Dad regret their decision and just want to reconnect and that I am dragging this entire situation. I told him that if he thinks I'm 'dragging it out' then he can stay out of my life too. He's angry and says that I need to move on and that I shouldn't be withholding them from seeing THEIR grandchild. I say that THEY disowned me and so have no grandchild from a daughter that doesn't exist.  AITA? I don't hate my bro and I (kinda)  get what he is saying, but I just have a resentment for my parents. It's not like I had a baby just to put it against them,  but my lil bro thinks I'm going go die on a hill with them for something done several years ago and it's petty. I'm curious on what reddit thinks. I want a relationship with my bro, just not my mom and dad",

I asked her why as we both make pretty good money at our jobs, and we can't afford our current lifestyle with just one income. she says it's because I make a lot more (which is true, I make about 40% more) than her and we could scale back our lifestyle - and said it's been on my mind a lot - I think working 9-5 just isn't for me I asked her if she was being serious, and she confirmed that she is. I said that I'm not comfortable with that idea, and said maybe if we have kids she could be a stay-at-home mom but I'm not cool with her being a stay-at-home wife. and she said that I was being manipulative. since we're both child-free. but I just said that as a hypothetical - since I'm not at all okay with being the sole 'bread-winner. that divulged into a pretty heated argument. with her saying that I should support her dreams (she never stated what she wants to do with her staying at home, even though I did ask) so this is where I may be the asshole - in the heat of the moment I said where is this coming from,  why is it your dream to be a stay-at-home wife? is it your dream to be lazy? she got really upset at that, and had gone to her mothers and said we'll talk more when you calm down I'll be real here, I don't want her to be a stay at home wife, I'm not okay with being the sole breadwinner, and I do not wish to support this dream - I want a partner in life, not a dependant doing nothing productive with their days. aita?",

My moms definitely pissed that I said that, I can tell. But I'm also upset the person who birthed me is trying to get me to pay what I would pay a landlord for rent just to sleep in her house.  Even 100 a week I would have been more inclined to be okay with, but 600 a month just to be able to sleep at my parents house seems a little high. If I am paying $600 a month I think I would deserve my own spaces around the house also as I would with a landlord, it seems having a landlord would be a better deal for me in this case. ",

It was hard living for a long time money-wise but I always tried to do best by my son. Today I own my own gym and my son is now 22 and going to college and works at my gym full-time. He came out to me when he was 14 years old and I\u2019ve always been supportive of him and his identity.  I\u2019ve been with my fianc\u00e9 now for about 2 years and while she does come from a very deep religious and conservative family, she has never had any issue with my son \u2013 at least nothing she has ever expressed to me. My son has been dating his boyfriend since he was 18 and I\u2019ve gotten to know him really well. However my fianc\u00e9 told me recently that she does not want my son\u2019s boyfriend to come to the wedding nor does she want her parents to even get the inclination that my son is gay. That if they found out, they would have a complete fit. This really bothered me because I refuse to ask my son to go back in the closet. What is going to happen in the future? When my son gets married himself? Will they want him and his husband barred from other family events? He\u2019s my son and will be the best man and it would be unfair to deny him a plus one because her family has an issue with gay people. When I told her this, she got very angry with me and told me that I was being selfish and over-dramatic \u2013 that it would just be for this one day, that she wants the perfect wedding. I told her that this was unacceptable and that I was not going to ask my son not to bring his boyfriend. It\u2019s my wedding too and I was his boyfriend there.  After that I got the silent treatment for a day and since then it hasn\u2019t been discussed again. However, it has left an extremely bad taste in my mouth and has me contemplating calling the wedding off. I do not want to marry into a family that would potentially discriminate against my son. I love my fiance very much but my son will always come first. I told my brother and he said that I was being the asshole here \u2013 that it would just be for one day and that since my son is an adult, it\u2019s unlikely that he would have that much interaction with his \u201cstep grandparents\u201d in the future anyway. I still don\u2019t feel comfortable about the entire situation and am really thinking about calling the wedding off. Would I be the asshole if I did this? Am I being unreasonable here?",

We pay the taxes and services / maintenance on the house, our son pays for his groceries and the house utilities. All was going well for a few years, our son meets a girl and they get serious. We met her and she seems nice enough.  The announce their engagement and she moves into the house with our son.   Now for the problem: The wedding !!!  We hold a little get to know you BBQ at the PA house, my son and daughter are there, as are our sons fianc\u00e9 and her parents, and sisters.   We all seem to be getting along well, my wife, daughter and the fianc\u00e9 go into the house along with her mother an sisters and my son.  A few minutes later my wife and daughter come out and are really upset. The come over and tell me we're leaving and driving back to NJ.  I try to find out what happened.  Once we get back to NJ and they calmed down they tell me that our son and his fianc\u00e9 along with her family don't want us at the wedding.  According to what I was told We're not their kind of people.  I was livid, I called my son and asked him WTH this was about.  He tells me that her family feel that we are not good enough and will embarrass them at a family wedding and that we are all uninvited from the wedding.   I let a week go by to calm myself down and drive back to the PA house, the new future in-laws are in the house along with the fianc\u00e9.  It appears that they all moved into the house They ask me why I'm there, I tell them that since we aren't invited to the wedding, I was coming over to talk to my son.  They tell me to leave their house.  I lost it, and told them that they had 30 days to get out.  Tell my son I'm selling the house and he could find somewhere else to live with all of you.  I go to a realtor in town and list the house for sale.  They call my son at work and tell him what I said.  Apparently they thought that he owned the house. He calls me and asks why I'm selling his house, I tell him I paid for it along with the taxes on it and it is mine.  He was living there rent free, but since he doesn't want us in his new life, he has to get out.  I tell him the same as I told his future in-laws they have 30 days to get out then I'll get a lawyer and get them evicted.  Am I the AH for taking a hard stance on this.

For the last two years my brother and his fiance Sarah (32f) have been planning their wedding. And it's coming up in September. I was asked to be a bridesmaid. I figured i was only asked as a courtesy since I'm her soon to be sister in law but I still took it seriously. I have been a bridesmaid for the last two years. Just a few weeks ago I managed to save up to buy the 800 dollar bridesmaid dress. Over all in the last two years between group outings to parties, dinners,  lunches, clothes, etc\u2026 I spent thousands of dollars. Eventually all the girls in the wedding and I became extremely close and I started to get hyped for the wedding.  Sarah recently got close with her brother's wife Becky (30f). Last week she dropped the ball on me that she no longer wants me to be a bridesmaid and she would prefer if Becky would take my place.  It broke my heart a little but it's her wedding and it's not my place to tell her how to run it so I said it was fine. Yesterday I went to my brother's house to pick up the bridesmaid's dress, and was going to see if I could return it since it was within the time frame.  Sarah was completely appalled and said that Becky was going to wear it since she and I are the same size.  I said that would be fine, but they would have to pay me the 800 for it. Sarah said that Becky couldn't afford and I should just be nice and let her use it and said that I could keep it after the wedding.  I explained that I'm not just giving away the dress, and I'm not ever going to usei after the wedding. After some bickering back and forth I just ended up taking it and leaving.   My brother and Sarah tried to compromise with me, and say I could be the assistant flower girl and I felt offended at the offer. After I said no, they then said that Becky could give me 250 bucks for it. Again no and I returned the dress and got a full refund.   I told them I understand that it's their wedding but they are being extremely disrespectful to me and I don't need to deal with it and I'm not going to the wedding. Today my coworker says she has an extra round trip plane ticket to go to Miami that she'll sell to me for half price plus I would have to pay for half the hotel and I can go hang out with her in Florida. The only downside is that I'll be in Florida for the week of my brother's wedding.  So will I be the asshole if I just go party in miami instead of going to my brother's wedding?",

        "selftext": "So I (21F) have been friends with Loreen (22F) for 17 years now and we\u2019re really close. She recently gave birth to her daughter and her and her husband recently told us the name. They decided to name their daughter Ghiuliyette (pronounced Juliet) and her middle name is Mahriya. I thought the spelling was a joke, until she told me they are serious. I told her, that with that spelling of a simple but beautiful name is just going to ruin that little girls life. She got mad and told me to stop \u201eruining\u201c her mood and that I\u2019m being mean. I\u2019m completely honest. The spelling is just bad. Nothing else can explain it. Why ruin such a beautiful name by including letters that don\u2019t belong there?  I texted her yesterday and told her that the little girl will try to change her name or at least go by her middle name since it\u2019s normal. She told me to stop texting her, that I\u2019m a bad friend and that I\u2019m being the asshole for making fun of the name. I don\u2019t think I am. When I told her that the spelling is just bad, she went crazy. She told me that I\u2019m the worst friend ever and that I would never be able to see her daughter again. After that, her husband sent me an email, telling me to stop being so disrespectful. He thinks the spelling is cute and it just makes her unique. Unique-yes. But that\u2019s just going to make that little girl suffer and she will probably be bullied for that spelling. I haven\u2019t replied and honestly I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the asshole here, but I thought I\u2019d ask Reddit since y\u2019all are the best to judge. So, am i the asshole for telling my friend that the name she gave her daughter is bad and will ruin her life? Update: Alright, I get it. I\u2019m an asshole for going after the Name more than once. Sorry for that lmao. I just send her an apology text for doing it, yet I did write how she should try to look at it from another perspective. I also send a few screenshots of the comments just for her to see what other people think of it.FYI I\u2019m supposed to be the godmother, which is why I was extra worried lmao my bad Update 2: Hello again. I\u2019ve been asked if there are any updates and yes there are!So I\u2019ve been talking with Loreen a lot (over text) and she\u2019s slowly starting to notice her \u201emistake\u201c. I apologized again and we are good again. We talked about the name and she told me that she won\u2019t change it and really loves it, but is slowly understanding why it\u2019s weird for others, especially me. Her husband on the other hand is still pretty mad at me. He thinks that I took it too far and that my apologies aren\u2019t from the heart\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. I\u2019ve been asked if I\u2019m still the godmother and yes I am. There were thoughts of changing it, but now that we get along again, I\u2019m back in the role.  Back to the husband: he actually blocked me everywhere and is telling Loreen to do so too because he thinks that I\u2019m manipulating and that I\u2019m lying just so we can get close again. Doesn\u2019t  make sense. Idk. Well either way, it\u2019s getting better with the relationship, just not with the name. ",

        "selftext": "I'm, f33 engaged to my fiance, m36. I have a 4yo daughter and he has a 16 yo daughter. He comes from a conservative family so we won't move in together til after marriage. So far we're on good terms as a blended family. But I noticed that my stepdaughter acts kind of distant towards my daughter. Everytime I try to talk to my fiance about it he'd tell me to give the kids a chance to bond and warm up to each other. My stepdaughter's 16th birthday took place on sunday. Since she's into baking. She decided to bake cupcakes instead of having an actual birthday cake. My daughter and I went over to my fiance's house to attend the party and I brought my stepdaughter a gift which was an iphone. We sat down as she started serving everyone cupcakes. Then when it was my daughter's turn, she bluntly said she was sorry but she didn't save any for my daughter. I felt confused, I asked if she made enough cupcakes and wether there were guests that came uninvited. She said no and that she just didn't make one for my daughter. I asked why, she refused to say. I was so mad and felt hurt on my daughter's behalf. I got up and told my fiance that I wanted to leave. My fiance tried to stop me and offered his cupcake to my daughter but I refused to take it. On the way out, I grabbed the gift I brought for my stepdaughter and she stood there and watched. I could hear her yell dad she took the iphone while I was walking out with my daughter. My fiance tried to get me to go back inside but I refused. Later, He came over and we had an argument. He said that I overreacted, and that I know how some teenagers can be moody and do random stuff without an explanation so I shouldn't have taken it personally. I said she excluded my daughter and didn't save her a cupcake but he said it was just a cupcake and then reminded me that he offered his cupcake and said I should've accepted it and called it a day. He said taking the iphone *which was supposed to be a gift* back was poor taste and it might hurt my relationship with his daughter. I refused to give it to him so he could give it to her since she was crying about it. He left and was mad at me. We haven't talked since then except via texts. Edit# She's been wanting the iphone for a while and since her dad couldn't buy it I decided it'd be nice if I gifted it to her. For those who are asking how a teenager could own an iphone. ???? I'm sorry if it's uncommon where you live but where I live, Iphones are the most common phones. also, I saw that she served her girlfriend a whole plate of cupcakes so it's not like she baked a specific number.",

My husband (m36) works an office job and because he's a family-oriented type of guy, he always hangs put with his family. His family live on a ranch in the middle of literally nowhere. It's a hassle to go there and due to my work nature, I don't go to most of their functions, I do however make sure to attend the big ones. Last week, his family wanted to host a BBQ party. He wanted me to go with him so badly since all his brothers were bringing their wifes and since they mocked him for coming alone in the past. I said sorry but I had a shift to cover. He begged, suggested I swap shifts with other nurses who are my friends and even called them all to beg them to cover for me. I grew irritated and told him to stop it. He sulked for a whole day then dropped it. In the morning, and hours before my shift I discovered that my car's tires were out of air. My husband offered to drive me to the hospital at 4pm and I agreed. I got ready and we got in the car but instead of taking me to the hospital, he drove me straight to his family's ranch. I was dumbfounded and angry after he said he tricked me into attending this BBQ and that I had to suck it up and set this shift out. I was so mad I didn't know what to say. We got to the ranch and I sat outside fuming. I waited and saw I still had time to make it to the hospital if I figured out a way to get there. I watched my husband go inside leaving his Keychain next to me (right where he was sitting) I took it and rushed to the back where all cars were parked, got into the car and drove off. His dad saw me and told him. He started calling my phone relentlessly til I turned it off. I got to the hospital in time but didn't dare turn my phone on til it was past 8 pm. I opened it and saw tons of angry messages from him berating me calling me horrible and a manipulator. I got on the phone with him and he yelled about the awful stunt I pulled and bailing from the party and making him look bad infront of his family. He then calmed down and said that he now knows that work is more important to me and that he won't ever trust me afteri basically stole his car and ran with it. We've been on terrible terms since then. His family are also mad but I haven't spoken to them about it yet nor calcified anything. AITA for what I did? I was desperate and worried that messing my shift might cost me my job.",

After the baby shower my sister pulled me aside and asked why I didn\u2019t pick nothing out off her registry. I had said I saw those and thought they were cute and the registry is just a suggestion. My sister got annoyed and said the registry is stuff they actually need and that I gave her useless things, then walked away. I guess she talked to my mom because my mom also said to me I should\u2019ve just picked something from there because I know how my sister is and it would\u2019ve helped her out.

        "selftext": "I (40m) have a sister (30f) who is getting married in a week. The groom proposed to her a year ago at a family dinner that left everyone speechless, but very happy for them as they are longtime companions. During this dinner, my sister asked my son (17m) to make her wedding dress. My son has always loved design and fashion, he took technical courses in these areas and sewing, and even his friends keep asking for his clothes because they are so beautiful. He agreed, but said that he needed time and that he would need her opinion constantly.  At first my sister was very annoying. My son drew about 50 dress designs in a month and she only liked one, which he continued with. He sewed it with great quality fabric which I paid for as I wanted to get involved in a certain way. For five months he made several adjustments to suit her wishes, as she always complained about something. After a while, he arrived at the final model and it was just amazing. My mother cried seeing my sister in the dress and I confess that I almost got emotional too.  The problem was that last week my son came to talk to me about the wedding invitation that had not arrived for him, but for other family members. I thought maybe he didn't need one, but it still felt weird. I messaged my sister raising this issue and she replied that she didn't want any underage people at her wedding because there would be alcohol. I asked if she was going to make an exception for my son, but she cut me off and said no.  There are no children in our family, my son is the only minor, so I didn't see any sense in this rule for family members. And to make matters worse, my son was very sad and cried because he spent months on this dress and couldn't go to the wedding. I was very upset and told my sister that she should look for another dress as soon as possible, as she would no longer wear the one my son made.  She called and yelled at me, saying I was being unreasonable and that I couldn't do this. My mother called me saying I should deliver the dress and follow the rules, but I didn't and hung up on her. Because of this, the family is divided. Many agree with me and condemn my sister's action saying she could only make an exception, but another part says I'm unreasonable and I'm spoiling her big day.  I don't think I'm being wrong but just rational and paying her back in kind. So AITA? UPDATE:  first I would like to thank all the comments and suggestions, I really didn't expect my post to resonate so much.  I talked to my son about the suggestions you guys gave me and he agreed to sell the dress at market price. He calculated the price of everything and the value was quite high. We sent the proposal to my sister and she hated it. She said she couldn't afford it because it was too expensive and it should be a gift because she is family. I responded by saying that it was too easy to say she was family to get a free dress, but not enough to include my son. She cried on the call and begged me not to ruin her day, but I didn't call because that to me was bullshit.  At no point did she offer to just let my son go or apologize for it.  And for anyone who said that maybe she's homophobic, I'm not sure, but I think who could be influencing her is her fianc\u00e9 who is a Christian and has never been close to my son. However, I don't care if he's doing it or not. If she wants to exclude my son from this event then she will also be cutting ties with me.  And for those who are asking for a photo of the dress, I'm sorry to disappoint you, but my son didn't agree and unfortunately I won't post it because of that.  If anything else happens I'll let you know, until then, thank you all!",

        "selftext": "My girlfriend [31f] and I [36m] have been together for about two years now. We live together. About nine months ago I picked up running as a hobby and I have since grown quite fond of it. I currently run an average of 25 miles a week. A few months ago I decided I wanted to try a 5k or 10k, and after some Google searching found a 5k in my city that looked fun. I registered for it, paid the fee, and decided to start training specifically for it. I mentioned it in passing to my girlfriend that night, and she asked if she could come too. I was psyched about the idea of running a 5k with her and said yes, but warned her that she would probably want to start training because I was going for a sub-27 minute time, which might be tough for a complete beginner. She said she would like to train with me, which, again, sounded fun. The next morning I woke up at 5am for my run as I usually do, but my girlfriend was not up for it and told me she'd go later. This continued for a week, and then two weeks, and finally I managed to get her up once for a run. She was miserable the entire time and I basically didn't get any exercise.  Last Friday, the day before the race, I asked if she was really up for it. She insisted she was. She then told me that she would just skip-gallop it, like she used to do with her mile runs in middle school. I asked her to demonstrate what a skip-gallop was, and she showed me this bizarre side-stepping gallop, as if she had casts on her legs. I told her it seemed like a really inefficient way to run, but she insisted it always worked for her. Saturday was the day of the race and right out of the gate she utilized her skip-gallop strategy. Two minutes in I realized that she was already completely gassed. She started asking me to wait so we could walk together. I apologized, told her I loved her, and left her behind to finish the race. I ended up with a time of 26:43, beating my goal. After the race I tried calling her but she wouldn't pick up. When I made my way back to the car I realized she had left me. I took an Uber home, and right when I walked in the door, I was met with cry-shrieking about how I ditched her. I tried to calm her down and explain that she kind of brought it on herself but she was not interested whatsoever. Yesterday she gave me the silent treatment all day.

        "selftext": "Many years ago, I was married to man named Mark. 2 years into the marriage, I found out he was cheating on me and got the other woman pregnant. It was a huge blow because I too was pregnant with his child. I was only 9 weeks pregnant and was determined to abort the child and divorce him. He begged me to reconsider, and insisted I give our relationship a second chance, and so I did, albeit reluctantly.  I had a very unhappy pregnancy and when I was 6 months pregnant, I learned that he never stopped seeing the other woman. He told me that he was torn and that he was in love with both of us. I wasn't willing to tolerate any of that bullshit, so I moved out and filed for divorce. I wanted him to disappear from my life, but being pregnant with his child made things difficult.  I never bonded with the baby , and the baby being his offspring contributed to the negative emotions that I felt.  I told him that I didn't want this baby. So when he got together with the other woman, I gave her the choice to adopt the baby, which she did. With that, I officially signed over my parental rights as soon as the girl turned 6 months old (I left the day she was born). When I left, I told Mark that I didn't want anything to do with the girl and the other woman was free to be her mother.  I moved to another country and tried to leave that part of my life behind. I met a wonderful man and we got married. He knew all about my past and now we have 3 wonderful kids who are 9, 5 and 2 years old.  Recently, my ex Mark contacted me out of the blue and told me that my biological daughter, who is 14 now, wants to meet me. Apparently, his wife had passed away and before she died, she confessed that she wasn't her biological mother.  I'm torn. I don't want to meet this kid. It was very difficult for me to leave that part of my life behind. I was depressed for years. I reminded him that I gave up my parental rights years ago and that I wanted nothing to do with both of them. I planned on telling my kids about their half sibling once they were grown and mentally mature, not right now when they are still so little. I told him to never contact me again and hanged up.

My husband\u2019s parents, his 2 brothers (ages 38 and 40ish), and his brothers\u2019 girlfriends/fianc\u00e9es have a tradition of going out to dinner once a month. I am invited about 50% of the time. I\u2019ve talked to my husband\u2019s brother\u2019s fianc\u00e9e, and she says she is invited every time.  When I say I\u2019m not invited, I mean that my husband tells me \u201cI\u2019m going to the family dinner. It\u2019s probably best if you sit this one out.\u201d When I expressed that I wanted to come, he told me that it would be for the best if I didn\u2019t. It has caused several fights. About a week ago, my husband went to a family dinner that I wasn\u2019t invited to. I was very pissed. So earlier that day, I called and made a reservation at the restaurant they were going to. My husband left the house, not knowing about my reservations, and I left 15 minutes after him.  I ended up seated at a table where I couldn\u2019t see his family. So I got up as if I was going to the bathroom and walked right past them. They were all there, including his brothers\u2019 SOs. My husband looked completely shocked and asked me what I was doing there. I told him that I had just been dying for a steak, so I came and got one at the restaurant.  My mother in law said it was very rude of me to interrupt their family dinner. I pointed out that I wasn\u2019t trying to join them, I was just going to the bathroom. I told them to have a good meal and I left. I went and finished my steak by myself. My husband was really pissed when he came home, and he told me that he couldn\u2019t believe how much of an asshole I had been. I said that he was an asshole for not inviting me to his dinners when his brothers\u2019 SOs got to go. My husband said that the decision to invite was between him and his family, and I should respect it.  Anyway, with the way the word asshole was thrown around, it made me think of this sub. So I wanted to ask if I am the asshole. Am I? Edit: I don\u2019t know how to add an update in this sub, so there is an update posted to my profile",

        "selftext": " I f32 just got engaged to my fiance m37 Sam. We do not live together because we're waiting til marriage given he and his family are highly conservative Christians but they're really nice and loveable people.  I had plans to spend NYE with Sam but he said he was out for NYE dinner celebration with his parents then called me again inviting me to join them and I happily did. His parents were there, <they welcomed me and ordered many dishes and desserts and drinks. We celebrated and had great time that is until it was time to pay. I pulled my wallet out of my bag letting them know that we'll split the check between us. Sam mumbled no you don't have to, we invited you but I insisted. He and his parents then stared at me; I asked what was wrong and both MIL & FIL said they didn't have money on them. I was shocked I turned to Sam and he said he too forgot his wallet at home and didn't bring enough money to cover even on round of drinks. His dad then laughed nervously aright so guess we should let the doctor pay!! I was taken a back I said I'm sorry but no this is just so much money to spend on one dinner by myself and I didn't think I was expected to pay the entire bill. Sam said I should pay and he'd pay me back later but I said no since I know he will have to get a job to pay that much money. I said I'm sorry but this isn't the first time I've been put in this situation by him and family where I'm expected to rescue them after they somehow forgot their wallets and expectbothers to pay hundreds for their extravagant dinner. I told them I'll only pay for what I had and that's it, he and his parents were shocked. They started arguing about how I have the potential to pay right there and then but I was acting as if they were strangers not family but that doesn't mean I'm obligated to pay, how could someone go out to a fancy restuarant, order so many dishes, desserts and drinks without bringing money?. Sam begged that I just do it and call it a night but I refused. The argument got heated then I got up and walked out. Sam called later at 2am basically yelling that I ruined NYE celebration and made his parents suffer because I refused to pay the entire bill amd instead acted selfishly and paid only for myself after they were gracious enough to invite me. I told him how unfair it was for me to pay even if I have a good salary doesn't mean I want to spend it all on fancy dinner. He didn't reply he just said he'll pray that my parents will let this go and not resent me after I basically damaged the relationship with them. I felt awful thinking I should've covered the bill instead of leaving. AITA?",

I got a raise on my salary. now I earn 30% more than he does and I noticed that he's been using this to ask me to pay for him and his friends. Whenever I say no or why should I pay for this? he'd respond with the 30% that's why. he acts as if the 30% is unfair or that I'm not dserveing of it. Several times he has tricked me to pay for his and his friend's meals by asking me publicly. Let me say that I'm too nice to say no, I hate confrontation especially when we're at a public place like a restaurant so I just grin and pay. Last tuesday, he asked me to join him and his buddies for dinner. I told him from the start I wasn't paying for their food and he shouldn't expect me to. He said he got this and no worries. We got to the restaurant. Met his friends, ordered food. And in the middle of the meal he leaned in and whispered that I would be paying for everything he and his friends ordered. I got so mad I whispered back noooo but he probably relied on me not causing a scene in public and infront of his friends. he said you have enough money you could pay for everyone's food, 30% remember?. I was fuming inside. instead of reacting negatively and losing my temper. I waited til the bills arrived (they were already split from the start when we first ordered) I paid for mine then I excused myself to the restroom. I then sneaked out from there, got into my car and went home. I started getting phonecalls from my fiance then texts asking where I was. I texted back saying I didn't appreciate how he put me in this situation and basically tricking me into paying for his and his friends food. I told him I went home then stopped replying. An hour later he came and started yelling at me calling me selfish, irrational, cheapskate and childish for sneaking out like that and leaving him stuck with a bill he could not pay (He had to call his brother for help). We had a loud argument then he walked out. His friends didn't speak to me on this but he told me they're disappointed in my behavior and are telling him to take time and reflect on the type of woman he's gonna be married to. AITA for what I did? Is what he's expecting from me fair or justified?. ETA: Some info: (1) he said that because the restaurant wasn't expensive then I could have just paid. (2) He admitted not telling me about it til later knowing I'd refuse. He still thinks my reaction was childish and unacceptable.",

I immediately shut down that idea and told her we would have to think of something else because there's no way I'm charging my son to live in our house. She said it was reasonable since I was paying most of his college tuition but I told her there are alternatives. I suggested we stopped eating out so much because it's $50-$100 per meal but she didn't like that idea. I suggested other things which she rejected so I told her I'm open to suggestions but my son isn't going to be our source of income. she told me I should think more of her than my son.

        "selftext": "Married 15 years and almost didn't make it this far.  In our second year of marriage my wife went home when I was deployed and slept with Some Dickhead (who I'll refer to as SD from here out) who she was loose acquaintances with growing up.  She hadn't seen him in years but he just happened to show up during my daughter's birthday party because he was the son of one of my mother-in-law's old friends.  SD and my wife hooked up later that week after reconnecting.  The reason I didn't kick my wife's ass to the curb and eventually forgave her is because she told me herself soon after I got home.  And she didn't try to justify it with the oh well you were gone, i felt lonely blah blah blah.  No she actually said straight up that she was a fucking dumbass (her words not mine, though I agree) and she felt so sick and disgusting for doing it.  She immediately cut off all contact with SD and it took a lot of counseling and healing but here we are today; feels like non-stop since that time that my wife has gone above and beyond proving that I was right to keep her.  Well my mother-in-law called yesterday and she heard from SD's mother that SD died in some workplace accident and they're having a funeral service this weekend.  My wife told me this and that she wanted to go and it was like I got kicked right in the dick.  I instantly felt nauseous and had fucking horrible flashbacks of when she told me about her affair. All those horrible feelings resurfaced along with the shitty memories of me crying my fucking eyes out and my image of her shattering.  The pain felt as fresh as when she dropped that bomb on me.  I asked her why seeing as she hadn't talked to the guy in over a decade not to mention...you know....she fucked him while we were married.  She keeps saying shit like it's the right thing to do and she just wants to pay respects.  I can't stop repeating that I'm so hurt with that decision as he's had no part of her life in so long and I'm re-living all those shitty nights I was sure our family would be shattered and I would only see my daughter 50% of the time.  After some back and forth I put my fucking foot down and told her NO, she cannot go.  I said it's so disrespectful to me and our marriage and we've been on the silent treatment since then.  AITA?  EDIT: Seems like people are starting to trip up on me saying feels like non-stop since that time that my wife has gone above and beyond proving that I was right to keep her. as if I'm saying I own her and she's a piece of property to me.  That is not the case, I am simply illustrating that she didn't just say she'll do better, she proved it with her actions and has made me a very happy man in our time together. EDIT 2: I apologize for nothing and honestly it brings a happy tear to my eye to to see so many people referring to him as SD, because that's what he was.  Fuck 'im. A lot of people are saying it's her decision to make and it is but that doesn't mean I have to like it or support it, and yes right at this point I can see myself walking away if she insists on going.  We're going to counseling starting tomorrow",

        "selftext": "I (46M) live with my wife and my 17 year old son. My wife has been on a different continent for about a month taking care of her dying mother, so it has just been me and my son for that time. My son and I have a very close relationship where he tells me almost everything going on in his life. On Saturday, he told me that he was going to his first ever high school party this upcoming weekend. He was a bit nervous since he had never really drank before, but he knew that he was going to on that occasion. I'm not sure if this is relevant, but this is in Canada where the drinking age is 19 (in my province), and teenage drinking is very common. I asked my son if he wanted to have a few beers with me while we watched a sports game that night, as a test run of sorts. My logic was that if he goes into the party with zero awareness of his tolerance then it could end badly, and it would be best for him to find out his limit in the safety of his home with me. We had some beers over a few hours in the night, and I cut him off at 6 (he has had beer in the past, but never more than one at a time). He was pretty drunk but he was okay, and slept it off. We talked about it the next day, and we agreed that six was a bit much for him, and now he knows to have fewer than that at the party. I was actually pretty content with this whole situation, since he had his first experience drinking in a safe environment, and I feel much more comfortable with him going to a party now. However, in an effort to be transparent I told my wife about it the other day over the phone, and she was livid. She thinks it was reckless and irresponsible. AITA? INFO: I understandably am getting flack for not telling my wife beforehand, but I figured she had enough going on and I didn't need to bother her with something that seemed pretty trivial at the time EDIT: Thanks for all the comments, I am reading every single one! I appreciate the different perspectives",

Over the past few years my 23m son has been genuinely upset that I will not transfer my GI BILL to him. Those unfamiliar with the military, service members are able to transfer their education benefits to their spouse or children after serving a certain amount of time. However, I accidentally exhausted my GI BILL.  My daughter and oldest son never really showed interest in college, nor were my sons grades of the best.  Once my son moved out after HS our communication was minimal. Our relationship prior to him moving out was alao strained. As a parent, I hope I am not the only one to say my son and I just did not get along and could never seem to connect as he got older and got worse the older he got. About two years ago of him going no contact he messeged me, not to ask how we were doing or anything, but straight to the point that its my fault that he no longer qualifies for grants due to our incomes combined and why I did not transfer my GI BILL to him. I Informed him that I had exhausted it and that he is more than welcome to speak to a recruiter.  He then said I should have set 50-100 aside each month to pay for his college. At this point I call him entitled and told him I don't owe him anything once he moved out of my household.  (Summerized conversation) We go no contact again for a little over a year and recently another messege straight to the point asking how I exhausted my GI BILL, again told him he can go see a recruiter about it. Non,the less this conversation still ended on that I should be responsible for his college.  Let it be clear, before I joined the army I was a single parent having my first child at 17, living in poverty making less that 11k a year. I joined the army at 25, paying for college tuition out of pocket was never an option. I did the best I could as a parent and I know I would never win mother of the year. In both conversation I did apologize for the mistakes I made along the way. As, it's clear they bother him, but this conversation ended with him stating he does not view me as his mother and blocked me on everything. He made it clear to his sister that he does not view me as his mother and I am nothing more than an egg donor.   It is time for me to update my life insurance and do a will and I am considering excluding him. WIBTAH?",

I call my husband and tell him and he\u2019s like \u201cOh ok did you get on the pill?\u201d And I said no, I didn\u2019t want to be on hormones anymore and he flipped out and said I need to be on birth control because it\u2019s the best way to not get pregnant but like, there are things he can do to not get me pregnant but now his whole family and him are convinced I\u2019m like trying to get pregnant without his consent.

        "selftext": "I am black, and my wife is also black. I spent my most of my childhood in the foster system, but for a good part of it I was taken care of by an elderly Russian gentleman (we'll call him Dimitri Petrovitch). While he never formally adopted me, he played a major role in my upbringing, and I am very grateful for all that he has done for me. Unfortunately, he passed away many years ago, and he never had any children.  Fast forward to today, my wife and I recently had a son, and to honor the memory of my mentor, I decided (with my wife's approval) to name my kid Dimitri Petrovitch Williams. Williams being my last name, and Petrovitch being my son's middle name. However, it seems like it's only my wife and I who likes this name, as her extended family has been quite upset over it, saying things like What kinda name is Dimitri?, or You ain't white, you ain't Russian, why did you give your son such as a white name.  It's true that there's no part of me that's Russian (I an barely speak Russian), but I feel like he's been such a big part of my upbringing that I had to honor him somehow. I confided in my friends too, and they said something along the lines of You a black man and you gotta be proud of your own culture. You gave your son an identity that he's not even a part of, he's gonna have a hard time in school with that name. So my wife's family aren't happy with our decision, and it seems like my friends don't really have my back either. I'm keeping the name that's for sure, but should I have reconsidered? Maybe I could've honored my mentor in another way?",

I don\u2019t believe that a grounding and a confiscation of electronics is harsh enough for what Sam did, so I told Sam that she won\u2019t be allowed to participate in homecoming or attend senior prom.

Finally, I told her that she\u2019ll have to delete all of her social media accounts with either me or her mother watching.  Sam begged me to allow her to go to senior prom because it\u2019s a once in a lifetime event, and keep just her Instagram account because it had pictures going back years that weren\u2019t saved anywhere else. I told her that she shouldn\u2019t have been a racist bully.  My parents are temporarily staying with us while their house is undergoing renovations.

        "selftext": "Me (M25) and my wife of over a year (F26) (together for over 4) have always had a good relationship with each other. It has felt very love filled. We recently got into an apartment, one bedroom like 700 square ft so not huge. Once this happened I feel like things may have shifted. I work very long hours throughout the week with sometimes only one or maybe zero days off in the week, average of 75-80 hours a week. I bring home a majority of the money, (my paychecks are almost over 80% our whole income) not that it affects how I think of her and our relationship.  She is able to provide things like fun groceries (snacks/sweets) and when we go out she can pay for things like the tip or drinks and I really appreciate that and tell her thank you when she can swing it. She also does most of the chores in the small apt. Other than that I'm the person paying for our life. (Groceries/toiletries/outings/clothes/makeup and not to mention rent and all other real bills) She works in a VERY different field and works  3 sometimes if her job requires, 4 days a week. She is working toward her career and I'm proud of her for this. Most days she'll work an average of 6 maybe 7 hours on her work days. This is where the problem has started.  Alot of my work nights are late, 12 or 1 am when I get home. Ill pack snacks but never get to eat. So alot of days I come home hungry for an actual meal. Recently those nights have been more frequent and i just don't want to have to cook something for myself after a 13 hour day after doing the same all week. I just want to be able to eat with the minimal amount of work when I get home. The other night I came home around 1:30AM and found my wife passed out on the couch with an empty personal pizza from Little Ceasars. I got excited thinking that I had a cold one in the fridge waiting for me.....wrong. annoyed but not upset, I microwave some chef boyardee, scarf it down and call it a night. The next day I have the same kind of night, around 1:30 I get home. There she is passed out, now with a bowl of macaroni and weenies (one of my favorites) and again. Nothing in the fridge for me.  Not understanding why she couldn't just make enough for the both of us and put my bowl in the fridge, wake her up to ask. She gets a little snappy if someone wakes her up but this time she was pissed.Saying that she is NOT my maid and I'm being lazy trying to make her cook for me. I tell her I'm just hungry after a long day and it upset me seeing she cooked for herself and didn't think about me at all. I said she was being inconsiderate and that really set her off. Saying if I want a slave then she's not it. I told her I don't want a slave, I want a wife who seems to care about me. She looked at me with a shocked face and stormed out.  Her mother texted saying she showed up at their house balling and HOW I should be more considerate to her feelings. I haven't even responded because I just feel hurt and not cared for. I just wanted dinner. AITA? Edit: i really should have mentioned this is a conversation we have had before and i feel ignored since she barely acknowledges when ive brought it up. These last 2 times are after multiple conversations . Also definitely didn't want to seem like she shouldn't be sleeping at 1. Passed out is just terminology I use. If I'm dead asleep at 4 am I'm passed out. I appreciate the other things she does for me like cleaning but the other 8 hours of free time in her day I wanted to be thought of since I would do the same for her no questions.",

        "selftext": "So I'm the owner of a wonderful rescued macaw. She is a wonderful bird but has a lot of issues due to an abusive former home. I've had her for 3 years and since then haven't taken any vacations or trips away as it would be too disruptive for her. She distrusts everyone and is very reliant on her routine. I love her deeply and I'm happy to make sacrifices for her. They are permanent toddlers and very intelligent birds. I met my husband by the time his kids were older, my stepdaughter was 16 at the time. We married when she moved away for college. Nevertheless I thought we'd managed to have a decent relationship, until now... my stepdaughter is getting married in March, and naturally there's a lot of preparation involved. They're wanting a huge traditional wedding and she is stressed out of her mind. They live out of state, and she invited me recently to come visit her for a week to help make wedding plans and spend time with their 2yo. I declined and she insisted to know why, acting very hurt, and I explained the parrot... Well jt all went downhill from there.  She caused a massive fuss with her dad, saying she never got a mother figure and I never accepted her as my full blood daughter and this is the ultimate snub for a silly animal. That I'm cold and emotionless... I feel really hurt and I can tell he agrees with her even though he's refusing to take sides. But I don't see why I should be expected to take holiday time off work to babysit and bond all of a sudden and I don't see how I'm a monster for this... am I the asshole here? Edit: context of our relationship, we don't usually talk at all and she hasn't visited home in 4 years. Edit 2: Beginning to think it was maybe a mistake posting this. Mostly because this is a real and nuanced situation and reddit is no place for nuance, and maybe personal relationships shouldn't be judged in the AH context in the first place. But also because I should be more understanding and a bigger person regardless of who is or isn't the asshole. Life is too short to be butthurt and offended. I called my stepdaughter and told her that I understand this is a big moment in her life and she wants someone there to help and support her, and that I'm still willing to help her in any way I can to plan the wedding via zoom and virtually. We talked a bit and I asked her why she hadn't accepted me reaching out in the past and she apologised and said she didn't want to accept someone as a stand-in, fake replacement for her bio mom, but now she regrets it and would like a closer relationship, especially seeing how close her SO is with his mom. We ended the conversation positively and I'm hoping things can improve going forward. I told her I'm a crazy bird lady and asked her if she still wants a relationship knowing that and she said that after the wedding she's willing to travel to visit us if we have room... which we do. I'll leave this post up but I'm happy either way and I'm glad the feedback here motivated me to make the call.",

        "selftext": "I (F55) had been married to my husband (M60) for 20 years before he died. It was cancer.  He had two kids from a past marriage who were in their early teens when he married me. I had a 7 year old from an earlier relationship as well. We didn't have anymore kids.  I tried to treat my step children as my own but they never accepted me. They were very rude and insulted me whenever they could. Since I did not work they called me a gold digger who married their dad only for his money.  The truth was my grandparents were quite wealthy and left me a lot of money when they died. I lived well below my means and chose to stay home and raise my daughter, since I could afford that. I did not need his money at all. But I didn't bother sharing this with his kids and told him not to either. I did not want them to like me just because they might gain monetarily from me.  My husband on the other hand hated how they behaved with me. Their blatant disrespect made him not pay for their College tuition. Their mom couldn't pay for it and they had to take loans for it. They didn't even talk to him.  Even when he got cancer, they refused to come see him. For three years we struggled with the treatment. My daughter came to visit from time to time, when she could.  During this time only person who really helped both of us was someone we were not related to at all. This girl in her late 20s waitressed at a cafe we frequented. She was a single mom, taking classes at community college at night, working during day and raising her two kids. She took a liking to us and when she learned my husband was sick, spend whatever time she could visiting him. She has stayed nights at the hospital when I needed a break and basically been the daughter we wished for.  When he died, she helped me arrange the funeral. His kids came on the day and all they wanted to know was about their inheritance. I felt sick.  When I learned my husband has left his estate to me, (whatever is left after settling his bills, and it was around $25000), I decided to give it to the girl who helped us both so much. She tried to refuse but I insisted she take it. She needed it and in my opinion deserved it more than the ungrateful children.  My daughter understands why I did not give it to his children but is upset I did not give anything to her either. I told her she already had money and a job. Not to mention she will get my inheritance. This was in no way her money.  But his ex wife and kids are causing havoc over this and really upset with me. They are calling me AH for giving away money they deserve.  AITA?",

        "selftext": "Throwaway because I'm sorry of embarrassed about this.  I met a dude on tinder a few weeks ago, and we seemed to really hit it off. We had a lot of the same hobbies, and I felt a spark between us that I'm sure he felt too. After we got passed the talking phase, we decided to meet at his house for coffee.  It was great when I arrived. We talked loads, and even held hands! However, I was on the third day of my period, and after a couple hours I needed to change my pad. I ask for the bathroom, and he directs me to it.  After I finish changing, I notice his trashcan is pretty full. Not sure what to do I wrap it in toilet paper and sort of smooth it into the trash can so it isn't sitting on the edge.  We hang out for about an hour more and be excuses himself to the bathroom. A few minutes pass by and he comes out, and says he needs to talk with me. He says that I shouldn't of thrown away my pad because he might touch it when taking out the trash, and that it was gross and unsanitary. Apparently he saw that the trash looked different, unwrapped the toilet paper, and saw my used pad.  I was mortified. I apologized profusely, and he seemed to take it well. He just told me not to do it again, and if I needed to, just walk a few blocks to a nearby grocery store to change. I left after that, not think too much of it.  However, I've recounted the events to a few friends, and they think he's a major asshole. I'm not entirely sure. He was really kind about it, and didn't seem to get angry, but I'm also starting to see their point too. It's a normal body process for people with a uterus and I agree, should be more normalized. I'm just not sure what to think, and any judgement would be greatly appreciated.",

        "selftext": "Okay, she\u2019s not my SIL yet but I used it to make the title simpler. She\u2019s my boyfriend\u2019s borther\u2019s girlfriend. I (f28) have been with my boyfriend (m32, Ian) for 3 years. We\u2019ve decided to host a small, early Christmas dinner. One of the people invited was his brother, Jake (m26). Jake asked if he could bring his girlfriend as she was all alone (they\u2019ve been together for 3 months) and we agreed, the more the merrier. His girlfriend, Naveah (f28) seemed a bit timid but lovely. Naveah brought her 8 year old son (that we didn\u2019t know was coming). She seemed lovely right until she went to the bathroom, she came out shrieking,box of my tampon she in her hand, literally gasping for air in between her shrieks. I could barely understand her. Turns out, my box of tampons was visible (duuuh, it\u2019s within a reach because hey, I need it monthly, why should I hide it and then look for it). She was going off about being disgusting, how could I be so shameless to have this in front of a child and other men and so on. I looked at her in disbelief, I couldn\u2019t believe she made a scene about a box of tampons, has she never been in a shop? Anyway, I told her that my tampons stay where they are but if she\u2019s so pressed, she can leave and go home where no tampons are present. She turned red, quite literally, her face was bright pink. Huffing and puffing, she dressed her kid and told Jake to drive her home which he did. Jake didn\u2019t come back but he called from her house telling Ian that I was the asshole. I was surprised to hear that Ian (my boyfriend) agreed with him. I thought he would be on my side. We were about to argue but I decided it wasn\u2019t worth it and went to my office to cool down and think this through. Am I the asshole for telling her to leave?",

        "selftext": "A little bit of context for you all, I ended up falling pregnant with my 10 year old daughter during a drunken hook-up with a friend in my mid 20s. Not the most glamourous or flattering truth but it's the truth all the same. When we found out we decided to keep the child and co-parent while remaining friends. We were never a couple and we didn't want to be one either. Four years ago he began to date his longterm girlfriend and they moved in together last year. She fell pregnant and i've been supportive to them both as much as I could be without crossing any lines; i've encouraged my daughter to help out whenever she's staying with them during the pregnancy and to behave, i've also made it clear that I want the children to have a close relationship despite having different Mothers, i've even said that if they were comfortable with it on nights I have my daughter if they ever want time alone i'll babysit once they have the baby so my daughter can spend time with her sibling. All in all, I thought everything was great and I was excited for my daughter to have a sibling as she's always wanted one but I had no interest in having another child. Three days ago my friend and his girlfriend had a daughter, they asked me to bring my daughter to the hospital to meet her little sister yesterday alongside others of the family. So I did exactly that but when they introduced us to the baby I was shocked. They'd named used my daughters name. She didn't seem to have any issue with this when she introduced the baby bold as brass. My friend seemed uncomfortable and wouldn't look at me directly. I asked them what they were playing at, at which point my friends father said he'd take my daughter down to the cafeteria to get something to eat and left with her. My friend told me to calm down and not overreact while his girlfriend told me she didn't see the issue and it was a pretty name. I asked them if they'd named the baby for my daughter trying to understand the logic here but his girlfriend said that no it was just a pretty name she liked. I then asked if they planned to use a nickname or a middle name when addressing to her on a daily basis and her response was that she didn't see a need for that. I told them they were being ridiculous and that they couldn't do this, I then told his girlfriend that I found this frankly creepy and told my friend he was being spineless if he was happy to go along with this. He tried to claim our daughter could use a nickname or something but I shut that down immediately asking why it was more reasonable for a girl who has used that name for a decade to shame her name compared to a baby who had no concept of what a name was yet. His girlfriend told me I was being a bitch talking to her like that after she just gave birth and asked the nurses to remove me saying I was being disruptive. Maybe my temper is running a little too hot though and I was too harsh on her when she just gave birth. It's just so fucking weird. Edit: I'd also like to state, I know that what they want to name their child is their choice, they could have called her Dinosaur for all I care but this is one name that should be off limits or adjusted, they even have the same surname as they have the same father...Something about it just felt malicious and deliberate as if she's trying to replace my daughter and for them both to spring it on us like that at the first meeting? no that was weird.",

I\u2019ve been doing this since I was 25 so I\u2019ve got a decent idea of what I can and cannot do. And focusing on work only for 1-2 months is a sacrifice I\u2019m willing to make for chill rest of the year. This year, I\u2019ve moved in with my boyfriend (m35). Well, technically he moved in with me because i own the house so it was a no brainier for him to move in with me. We split chores half and half. He works full time (37.5 hours a week). When he moved in, I had a talk with him letting him know that I can\u2019t do any chores in November/December and asked if he could pick up the slack because I\u2019m physically unable to do any chores as I can be working anything  between 12-18 hours a day (I take a full January off to decompress). He said he doubted I worked that much but we will see. I asked again in September and October to make sure he was aware that I won\u2019t be doing anything (I meal prepped in advance) and I felt he kind of dismissed me.Mid November, we had an argument about my chores not being done and I reminded him of what I told him. He said that he thought I wasn\u2019t being serious and told me there\u2019s no way he\u2019d do 100% of chores because he\u2019s working too. I said fine, don\u2019t do my chores, they can wait until I have time. That\u2019s how it was when I lived alone, no problem, I don\u2019t make much mess anyway. He wasn\u2019t happy but dropped it. We haven\u2019t seen each other much because I\u2019ve been working so much but he\u2019s been more and more pissed off and blew up at me today regarding the chores. He said I had to have a better work life balance and to grow up because the house was a mess. I told him if it was a mess it was his fault because I barely leave my office. He called me a lazy bitch. I told him k didn\u2019t have time for arguing and went back working. He stood in front of my locked office door shouting how he couldn\u2019t believe I was bei mg serious about not doing chores and it was an asshole move to leave it all to him. He thinks I\u2019m a major asshole for basically disappearing for 2 months and following through with not doing chores.  Am I really the asshole for saying I won\u2019t do chores and following through? Sorry for any typos, I\u2019m on mobile and my autocorrect hates me.",

I made myself comfortable and set up my tablet. An hour or two into watching, the woman two rows behind me tipped on my shoulder and told me that I need to turn it off immediately. A little bit confused, I asked why. She told me that her young son could see the show playing on my tablet and it's totally not suited for such young children because of the sex and violence involved in it. While I agree with that, I told her that I'm not going to turn it off. She then basically told me that I am an asshole for not considering other people around me. Is she right?  Edit: I want to clarify a few things that were mentioned in the comments: - I was wearing headphones all the time. - It was a flight with Swiss from Europe to a city in the United States. The in-flight entertainment system offered various movies and tv shows that were also not suited for children. However I have to admit that probably none was as bad as GoT. However, none of these shows was censored as far as I can tell. - I'm not sure exactly where (aisle, middle or window) the kid was sitting since it was behind me and I think they switched seats frequently.",

We're still getting to know each other and the things we love vs hate. So for the past couple of weeks he's been sending me pics of his car that has been sitting in the mechanic (his cousin's) shop for weeks. He went on and on about what needs fixing and made a long list and calculated the total then sent it to me as a screenshot. I looked at it wondering what is have to do with me? He told me about his financial hardship atm and asked if I could help pay for his car to get it fixed quickly, so he'll be able to take me on that roadtrip he promised. I felt uncomfortable bc the money he was talking about was around 2.5k and I don't have that kind of money on my hand. He brought up my college fund and suggested I skip one semester so I could pay for the car. I was shocked he brought that up, idk he knows how important college is for me but he assured me he'll pay me back on time and that I only have to skip one semester and that's it. I asked for time to think about it but after he kept calling I decided to just give a polite NO. He asked why and I told him it's because my education is my priority and I can't handle skipping a semster, even if it's one. He hung up saying he needed time then texted me saying that I did not show support after he made himself open and vulnerable, and that I chose money over him by refusing to lend it to him, and that he is struggling and in need and that didn't matter to me. I felt really guilty and I started calling him but he texted me saying that he might respond when I make room for a compromise. AITA for refusing to pay?

        "selftext": " I M34 got married to my wife Claire 2 years ago, She has a 6 year daughter (my stepdaughter) that she shares custody of with her ex husband Adam. So Adam has not dated anyone eversince he and Claire got separated, Claire always talked about how this was a good thing because she believes that my stepdaughter is better off without a witch stepmom to boss her around and abuse her. Then, Adam started seeing his now girlfriend about 8 months ago, Claire wasn't happy about it-in fact- she was livid that Adam introduced my stepdaughter to his girlfriend so soon. Claire demanded meetings with Adam's girlfriend to test and see what kind of stepmom she will be for my stepdaughter, I didn't give it much attention because of the drama and always having MIL involved as well. However, I very recently found out that Claire installed several cameras in Adam's house while he and his girlfriend were away on a trip, Claire had the key to Adam's house because most of my stepdaughter's stuff is there. Keep in mind that I found out by looking at the chat Claire had with MIL so she was in on it too, It irked me because that is a total breach of privacy but when I confronted Claire she said she did this because Adam's girlfriend was going to move in soon and she wanted to see how she treats my stepdaughter, I told her this was wrong but she said it was all temporary til Adam's girlfriend is in the clear. I still wasn't convinced and suggested she remove the cameras because of the huge legal troubles once Adam finds out but she lost her temper on me saying I should stay out of it because I clearly don't care about my stepdaughter's wellbeing and happiness, but she had no evidence or even reason to believe Adam's girlfriend might mistreat my stepdaughter. Claire said she just wants to double check and Adam does not need to know. But I disagreed and said that I will tell him if she won't remove the cameras which made her lose it on me and get MIL to shut me down and get me to stay in my lane but I couldn't. Claire said if I tell Adam then we gonna have a problem and urged me to mind my own business because Adam isn't more important than my relationship with her so I shouldn't even entertain the idea of telling him and upsetting claire who is just trying to make sure her daughter's future stepmom isn't some witch stepmom in the making. I still want to tell him but given Claire's reaction, I'm going to get hell for this and it may not be worth it since me and Adam aren't on good terms.  EDIT: I've decided to tell him...there is no way this is going to end well for Claire nomatter how hard she tries to downplay the situation. Yeah I'm a coward but that is her opinion. I told her that I was not going to get caught in the middle of this whirlpool but she insisted I was the one trying to get involved, still ignoring how messed up her actions were. She can go ahead and turn every argument into a screaming match where I'm the one to blame but I'm getting sick of it.",

        "selftext": "This might seem silly. I (24F) like wearing cheerful socks, since my uniform is all white (currently working as an phlebotomist), it usually cheers up the patients too.  I've spent a few years collecting strange socks, ones with sushi, pizza, corgis, cats, Nick Cage, etc. I think I had about 30 pairs. My boyfriend (29M) has always hated them, and thinks they're childish. So I agreed to only wear them to work, and never on dates or around his friends/family. I thought that was fair.  On boxing day his parents came over for coffee and gifts (just the 4 of us, which is allowed where I live, and keeping a solid 3 meters apart). I accidentally put on a pair of 'childish' socks, and his mother made a comment about it. I explained that I wear them to work to cheer people up, and she liked that. My boyfriend didn't.  The next day all my socks were gone, and the drawer was filled with plain black socks. I asked my boyfriend, and he told me he threw them away and purchased some more 'appropriate' socks, so I won't embarrass him in front of his parents again.  I told him that that's insane, they were mine and he had no right to throw them away. Not to mention that I spend quite some time collecting them.  So I made a list of the ones I remembered I had, and told him that I expect the same ones as a replacement. He told me that's completely unreasonable, and that it would take a lot of time/effort/money for him to find those specific pairs. I haven't changed my mind yet, they cost me a lot of time and effort to find too.  I think he's being controlling, he thinks I'm being unreasonable and demanding.  AITA? I think I might be an asshole for asking for the exact same pairs, I know that'll take a lot of effort to find. Edit: Thanks everyone for replying, I've realised that this might not be a 'normal' fight and am evaluating the relationship.",

        "selftext": "My brother is getting married in a few months and his future wife recently asked me to be a part of her bridal party. I was thrilled and excited to be included, but then she informed me that the dress code for the bridal party was gender-specific, with women expected to wear dresses and men expected to wear suits. As someone who identifies as non-binary and is more masculine presenting, I am uncomfortable with conforming to a gender binary that doesn't accurately represent me. I brought this up with my brother and his fianc\u00e9, but they insisted that they wanted all their guests to adhere to the dress code, regardless of how it made them feel. I ultimately decided that I did not want to attend the wedding, as I did not feel comfortable being pressured to conform to a gender binary that doesn't accurately represent me. My brother and his fianc\u00e9 are now upset with me, accusing me of being difficult and not willing to compromise. After a fight with them, I found out they went behind my back and involved my mom. She called me yesterday and told me I can put aside my identity for one day to make the day special for my little brother.  I now feel bad and didn't realize something as small as the clothes I feel comfortable wearing would cause a rift within my family.  So AITA for refusing to go to the wedding?",

        "selftext": "I'm German and I was traveling last weekend through Spain. I stayed at a hostel at a mixed room and some of the roommates where american. At night we were all mingling and talking about each other and one of the american guys, upon hearing I was German, told me ohh a fellow German!. At this point I wasn't actually sure if he was american, so I asked in German if he was german. He mumbled a bit and said haha sorry I'm German but I actually don't speak the language, only a few sentences But he kept bringing up about how being german shaped his life, how important german culture was, like he apparently celebrates Oktoberfest every year and so.  I asked why did he say he was german if he was actually american, he said that it was because his great grandfather was german and his grandmother was german-irish...okay, whatever that means, I asked him if he knew where his great grandad was from and surprisingly he did, Hamburg! But this was extra hilarious because then it makes no sense for the guy to celebrate Oktoberfest, as that's a Bavarian thing (ja ja nowadays you can find Oktoberfest in any major german city but its not tradition, only commercial) I still didn't say anything and we just kept talking. The guy kept making all these remarks about German culture and German food like hot dog with Sauerkraut (???). Me and my friends were then planning to go look for a place to drink and he asked to come with us so the germans should stick together. We had a few beers at a bar and he ONCE AGAIN brought up something about being german and saying he was gonna get the german flag tattoed in Germany, by this point I was already a bit tipsy and annoyed and I told him can you please stop saying that? You're not german my friend, you're american of german descent, you don't even know about german culture or food, or how to speak, you're really annoying me The guy looked pretty angry/annoyed and kind of scoffed and tried to jokingly say you're right, I rather be american, at least then I can say I didn't lose a world war. At that point me and my friends were rolling our eyes so hard that we just moved to a different place. Later some other guy not related to us told me that the guy was pretty annoyed/sad that I told him he wasn't german because apparently that was a big part of his identity. Now IDK was I the asshole for not letting him live in his delusion?",

My daughter\u2019s birthday was the day right after and it was perfect because all the family was in town anyways for the wedding. My husband is a surgeon and he loves to spoil our daughters and I love planning parties so I booked a really nice garden venue and made it a princess carnival theme for all the kids and adults to enjoy together.  It was a beautiful event but towards the end of it, I got pulled into the bathroom where SIL was upset and crying saying a 5 year old outshone her wedding. Then she got mad at me saying it was disrespectful to schedule the birthday party near her wedding time and not talk to her about.

        "selftext": "*I DO NOT GIVE PERMISSION FOR THIS POST TO BE SHARED OUTSIDE OF REDDIT *  So some ladies in our church occasionally send out invites for meal trains for people to sign up to bring meals for someone who recently had a baby or is sick or something like that. I get it. It's a nice idea to help people out. I have no problem and have participated sometimes in the past. Last week a meal train was posted for a lady named Sue (name changed obviously) who apparently had spent a few days in the hospital due to severe back pain. She's home now but still in pain and unable to do much. The meal signup stated about bringing a meal for 3 people. Sue lives with her husband and adult son. The husband and son work full time. Sue does not work. I decided not to sign up for this meal train because I also work full time. I figured if people want to, that's fine, but I don't have extra time to be cooking meals for people who have capable adults in the household to help out. Some people do have extra time, and that's great if they want to help out. Well, I'm guessing others felt this way too because the meal train just wasn't filling up very fast so they kept posting about it and posting about it. I kept ignoring it. Last night I got a call from a friend of Sue's. We'll call her Jane. Jane asked if I was aware that Sue had been in the hospital and if I could possibly sign up for a meal slot. I explained very nicely to Jane that I work full time and I don't often have time to make a full meal and that my husband and I usually just get our own meals or one of us cooks when we're able. She was like, Oh well that's ok. There are plenty of weekend slots availble too that you could sign up for when you're not working. I said, Well, aren't her husband and son home on the weekends? Couldn't they cook then? Jane got really snippy with me then and cut the conversation short. I told my husband about it and he thinks that I could have made time on the weekend to cook something and take it over just to be nice. I asked him why didn't he sign up then if he thought the needed meals on the weekend and he told me I was just trying to start an argument. I don't think I'm the AH because Sue's husband and grown son should be perfectly capable of cooking for Sue and themselves, especially on the weekend. But I might be the AH because I don't have much going on during the weekends and I COULD cook for them. I just don't see the need to. So.........reddit.......AITA?",
