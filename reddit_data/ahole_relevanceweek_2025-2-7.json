These porcelain dolls were around when I was a child and I had memories of getting in trouble for playing with them. They were absolutely beautiful. Well, when my mother died I (29F) decided to keep ONE doll, I know it wasn\u2019t left to me, but I felt like they meant more to me than they could to my niece. I contemplated giving it back to her when she was old enough to appreciate it. We\u2019re from Louisiana and hurricane Laura hit \u2026 when we evacuated. I took the doll with me because I knew it was sentimental and irreplaceable. My niece, however let all of the remaining five dolls get ruined in hurricane because she let them in the house when where got ruined. My twin sister (Jays mom) thanks that it\u2019s only fair that I give Jay the doll. I kept safe because after all it was left for her\u2026. My argument is that if I would have gave her the doll, it would have gotten ruined with the other ones because she didn\u2019t care enough about them to take them her with her. Fast-forward, we are now in 2025 and I have a daughter of my own. I 100 % believe if my mom would have known she was gonna have another granddaughter she would have left a doll to her. AITA? ",

        "selftext": "Son's birthday today. He's 5 years old. I wasnt there this morning as stay away from home some nights due to work. Even if had slept at home would have left for work before the kids woke. We have a party planned on Saturday, and will be there at dinner time tonight. I realised that my wife gave my son a present this morning. She said it was from 'us. Apparently she does this every year. I was hurt, and told her so. I thought it was selfish that she couldn't wait to share his excitement.  Her excuse is that it is unfair on him to make him wait. find that ridiculous, and believe he absolutely could wait.  I said the only reason to give it early is the selfishness of wanting to experience his joy alone without sharing it. AITA?  Edit(s): This blew up quicker than I expected (I couldn't get online for the last hour). And overwhelmingly with YTA responses, many with some unfair assumptions so I want to add some context in my defence although I think it wont change the general outcome. 1. Today is his birthday, although we have other special plans. Next week I'm taking 3 days off work, two of which are for a family trip and the third is a special day for my son. I couldn't get today off work though, and Saturday is his proper party, which I obviously will be there. I have a 1.5 hour commute each way (hence why I don't normally see him in the morning before he gets up for school), but I normally read the bedtime story when I'm home and I video call EVERY evening that I'm not home. I'm not an absentee father, and I'm not just a sperm donor. 2. My wife has bought most of the presents but not all of them. We tend to put things in gift bags not wrap them. Last year it was me that bought the main present, this year there wasn't a main present, it was mostly a few smaller ones because the family trips mentioned in (1) are really his main present. I don't expect her to do all the gift shopping and give all the ideas, I do a share of it. She does have more free time than me, and does more of the childcare than me. That's a problem of our (shared) lifechoices and not something that we can easily change. My long commute is primarily due to decisions on her part. 3. Yes, she said she does this every year, but first and second birthday are not quite the same level of concious response, and 3rd and 4th I am not sure what she gave him in the morning. As I mentioned, last year I got the 'main' present, and that was given in the evening I am definitely jealous if she is giving him presents. I definitely want to be part of the enjoyment of his birthday.  I was hurt and didn't understand why he had to receive the present when I wasn't there. Yep he's 5 years old, and every family is different. I don't remember receiving presents until the whole family was there in the evening. I thought that was normal, and assumed my wife had the same thoughts. We hadn't discussed it, and I was upset for missing out.I think if I knew, then I wouldn't have reacted that way, but it was a shock and I was upset. I still am jealous and have some feelings to work through. I don't like my work situation and commute, but I really don't see a way to resolve it (without significant financial risk that I'm not willing to take in this climate) so will have to suck up my disappointment. I called my wife selfish for getting the joy, alone without discussing it first, or without giving me the chance to join on video call. I guess I need to take the YTA verdict. Edit(again):Too many comments to respond to, and can't respond for at least a few hours so that I can spend time with my son on his birthday!",

        "selftext": "My (29F) daughter is five months old and goes to a daycare at my husband\u2019s (32M) workplace. My mother in law also works at the same place so she has easy access to the daycare. At least once a week she goes and spends 30 minutes to an hour just playing with my daughter. This rubs me the wrong way for so many reasons. As a mom, it frustrates me that she thinks it\u2019s okay to just drop by whenever without at least saying something or asking (I actually just found out while writing this that she tells my husband but nobody communicates it with me). As a former daycare worker, I would have hated having someone just come in and spend time with a child because now not only do they have infants to watch, but now they have to work around a fully grown woman and make sure that she isn\u2019t taking pictures/videos of other babies as well. I think my biggest issue is honestly that some days she gets to spend more awake time with my daughter than I do and I know that\u2019s a horrible reason to be frustrated with someone but it is what it is. Would I be the asshole if I asked her to stop visiting daycare so frequently? She comes to our house and gets to spend several hours with my daughter at least once a week so it\u2019s not like daycare is the only time she gets to see her.   ETA: Yes. I know I\u2019m the asshole for being jealous. After talking with my husband, I\u2019m realizing a lot of these feelings are based on big emotions from being exhausted and PPD. I don\u2019t hate my mother in law. This is my first and probably only child and she\u2019s my rainbow baby so I\u2019m very protective. For those of you that politely told me I\u2019m the asshole, thank you. For those of you that told me I need to see a therapist, already seeing one for my chronic depression and added postpartum depression so I\u2019m good. I\u2019m going to stop reading comments now and go snuggle with my baby that just got home. ",

        "selftext": "So, a little context: I (35M) am getting married to my fianc\u00e9, Audrey (29F), in a few months. My brother, Steve (30M), has been dating his girlfriend, Lisa (28F), for about a year now. I\u2019ve never really clicked with Lisa, but we\u2019ve always been cordial. She\u2019s kind of loud and opinionated. She also has a tendency to interrupt people when they\u2019re talking, and it drives me nuts. Here\u2019s where it gets tricky. A few weeks ago, my mom mentioned that I \u201creally should\u201d invite Lisa to the wedding, even though I didn\u2019t initially plan to. I told my mom that I was keeping the guest list tight, and that it was more about the vibe of the event. I didn\u2019t think it would be an issue since Lisa and I aren\u2019t close. But my mom started pushing, saying that if I didn\u2019t invite Lisa, it would be \u201csuper awkward\u201d for Steve and that \u201cfamily is important.\u201d I still didn\u2019t budge, and my mom seemed to accept it. However, I was talking to Steve yesterday, and he brought up the wedding. He casually mentioned that Lisa was upset she wasn\u2019t invited, and that it was \u201cweird\u201d that she was left out when she\u2019s been dating him for a year. He said that it would mean a lot to him if I reconsidered. I told him I didn\u2019t want to cause drama, but I just didn\u2019t feel comfortable inviting someone I don\u2019t get along with to my wedding. He got kind of quiet and then said, \u201cI guess I\u2019ll just skip the wedding, then,\u201d and walked off. Now, I\u2019m feeling conflicted. I don\u2019t want to lose my brother over this, but I also don\u2019t think it\u2019s my responsibility to make space for someone who isn\u2019t really part of my life, especially on such a personal day.",

        "selftext": "My 18yo daughter lives at home - as she should since she is not at college or working in a full time job. She graduated high school in 2024 and has a part time job.  She does not drive. My husband and I drive her to work, to her community activities, to hang out with friends, and to dates. She recently asked if she could have 5 people over for her birthday and for a sleepover. We said no. We told our kids that parties are fine through their 18th birthday and for graduation but after that we only have family celebrations. Our reasons: It's a small place and we'd be on top of each other.  After working our jobs all week and juggling her and her brother's activities, we need some calm and quiet. Also, we don't know these kids.  Having them over for a couple of hours is something I can gear myself up for, but an open-ended time of strangers in my space... my heart is racing as I'm typing this.  It makes me super anxious. Daughter knows this (about the anxiety) but has been arguing that it's not a big deal, everyone else does it, and I never have people over.  She has had people over from time to time, but since she and her friends are all dependent on rides, it doesn't happen often. I floated the idea of a 2-3 hour hangout but since she argued with us for about 20 minutes, my husband is like 'nope. not gonna happen. I understand that she's disappointed and wants to hang out with her friends for her birthday. So, reddit, would I be the asshole for not hosting a party for my daughter's 19th birthday? UPDATE 9:55 pm. Some thought provoking questions in the comments. No sleepovers ever? Yes, from around 2nd grade to age 16 we hosted a couple every year - except during Covid, of course.  She hasn't been interested for a few years.  Why doesn't she drive? Lost her driver's license after causing 2 accidents in 3 months.  Thankfully, only damage from the accidents was to the cars; all people involved were fine. However, insurance dropped her and threatened to drop us if she didn't surrender her license. How are you  trying to help her? I've been trying to get her to try for her driver's license again but I'm meeting with resistance.  Talked about the pros and cons of several career opportunities but she doesn't want to have anything to do with it.  Going to counseling, but she seems to use it as a vent session - which can be helpful! - rather than taking the homework and following through with the counselor's advice. Honestly, I know that I need to step up here and take the lead.  Humans tend to do a much or as little as is expected of them; I need to help her raise her expectations. Why isn't she in college? She's not interested in post secondary education right now. She may go back later, and I'm fine with that.  Why doesn't she have a full time job? She doesn't know what she wants to do.  She's currently refusing to look for a full time and I'm not willing to kick her out.  I know a lot of folks do that to their kid when they become an adult, but I don't want to.  I love her and like having her around, knowing she's safe.  Honestly, as a parent I am struggling with how to help her without pushing her away.  ",

We\u2019ve had a lot of ups and downs, we\u2019ve got 3 kids and he has never put in a lot of effort for my birthday (or any other holiday, for that matter). But we\u2019ve worked through a lot this past year and I know he is trying to put in more effort. He told me recently that he was going to pay someone to come deep clean our house as my birthday present. To be fair, I have said many times that I would love to have this done but it isn\u2019t something we need to be spending money on right now so we haven\u2019t done it.  He followed this up by saying that if I didn\u2019t want to spend the money, he would gladly just take the whole day and do it himself. When he told me this, I wanted to be very mindful of my reaction. Again, he has not been in the habit of gift giving or being super thoughtful when it comes to special occasions. I told him that I really appreciated the thought and saw the effort that would take for him to do but if he took the entire day to clean the house, I would obviously just be watching my kids and trying to keep them from coming behind him and messing all of his hard work up and ultimately that doesn\u2019t sound like a present. I felt guilty because I want to praise his effort but I also feel like this \u201cgift\u201d doesn\u2019t feel personal or thought out well, despite the effort. He didn\u2019t seem too upset by my reaction but now I\u2019m afraid he isn\u2019t going to do anything? I\u2019m also feeling a bit frustrated because if the roles were reversed, I would (and have) set something up where he would be able to go do something he loved with his friends and not have to worry about me or his kids.

First he asked me only a couple of random days, but now it is almost dayly. He deliberately puts his phone quite far away from our bed, so he has to get up to turn off the alarm. Now I have to get out of bed to turn it off, and I HATE it... Like I don't even know how to describe how much it annoys and irritates me... I am not a morning person, and he knows this, and I have my own morning routine as to make sure I am not grumpy towards everyone in the morning. But turning off his alarm messes up my routine and makes me really frustrated in the morning. Even more so when he asks me to turn off his alarm on my day off. My bf has his own company and prefers to be early at his office. So his alarm is usually set about 40 minutes before my alarm. But sometimes it is also set 10 minutes before my alarm goes off. He will ask me to 'please turn it off one more time' and then stay in bed till my alarm goes. Now this is where I might be the AH, because the extra time in bed he mostly spends cuddling me and I really love it. Before this all started he used to turn off his alarm himself and come back to bed to cuddle, but that doesn't happen anymore.

        "selftext": "My wife, Emma, and I have a 16-year-old dog named Sky who was recently diagnosed with an aggressive, fast-growing form of cancer. The kind that can\u2019t be cut out easily.  Given this, Sky\u2019s age, and other health issues, the vet didn't recommend treatment. Instead, he's got some pain medication to help keep him comfortable, and we were told to keep an eye on the cancerous lump on his chest.  That lump has gone from pea-sized to the size of a large grapefruit in under two months. Sky\u2019s incontinence is more frequent, and his back legs now give out regularly. He doesn't enjoy playing in the yard or chasing a ball and has become fussier about what he eats. He's also sleeping more\u2014up to 22 hours a day. The vet has said as the growth gets bigger, it's more likely to rupture, which would require urgent veterinary care. At that point, it's likely that Sky would need to be euthanized. It's possible that this could happen outside of our vet's usual hours, which would mean we'd need to take him to the emergency animal hospital. Given all of this, I've tried talking with Emma several times about whether it is still in Sky's best interests to continue on. I think the time has come to have him euthanized. This would allow us to ensure that his passing was as gentle as possible, in a place that is familiar and without the added stress of a medical emergency. The vet has said it's up to us, and he'd support whatever decision we made. Emma thinks that we shouldn't put him down just because things have become harder for us. He does still wag his tail when he sees us and enjoys scratches, but the vet has said that dogs can be really good at hiding when they're in pain, and I think that's what's happening here. Emma doesn't see it that way and thinks that because he's not overtly suffering, we should let him live out whatever life he has left. Also relevant: I work from home, so I'm the one at home with him every day. We've discussed what I should do if something happens and she's away for work. She's told me I should do what needs to be done even if I can't get hold of her or she can't get there. It seems she's accepted that he's close to the end of his life but maybe doesn't want to have to be the one to make the decision to end it? Yesterday, I had a sudden thought that I should just tell Emma that something happened during a time when she's not available and take him to the vet myself. It shook me that I'd thought of it, to be honest. Our relationship is built on a strong foundation of trust, and I know that if I were to do something like this and she found out, there would be no coming back from that. Our 20-year relationship would be over. However, I can't stop thinking about how it could be the best thing for Sky. So, I thought I'd ask the internet: would I be the a-hole if I had my wife's dog put down and lied to her about why? UPDATE: Thank you to everyone who has taken the time to share their stories. I really appreciate all the comments (yes, I\u2019ve read them all) and I\u2019m going to take the advice to continue talking with Emma about what\u2019s best for Sky. Hopefully, I can help her realize that it\u2019s time for us to say goodbye but if not, I\u2019ll continue to support them both as best I can through this difficult process. ",

        "selftext": "I m(32) was sent to the shopping centre on the way home from work to get lasagne sheets for my wife f(35). I went to the pasta aisle and took a look at the lasagne sheets on offer and found one box that stated \u201cno pre cooking required\u201d so I assumed that would be a great option and got it. Today while driving to lunch my wife said to me that she didn\u2019t mean this as an attack but that she had told me to get fresh lasagne sheets, which are the soft ones in the cold aisle. I told her I didn\u2019t hear her say fresh when she asked me or I would have probably figured out she meant cold. I then asked her what the difference was and why it mattered. She said that the fresh ones cook quicker.I responded that it does say no pre cooking required on the box, assuming maybe this was a newer technology and so it wouldn\u2019t be as long.She said that didn\u2019t matter. I then asked if she had used the no pre cooking required before and compared the cooking times to the fresh ones, since we don\u2019t make lasagne much (I can recall one time in our 7 years together) and I wouldn\u2019t think she would have used these before and was making assumptions. She then started to get angry and said that we always get the fresh ones and if she says she w at the fresh ones then that should be it and she shouldn\u2019t have to justify why she wants them, if she says to get them then just get them. I argued that I always like to educate myself and will clarify and ask questions rather than ever just go ahead and do what you\u2019re told, that isn\u2019t who I am and I should be able to ask questions and clarify. At no point did I say I wouldn\u2019t get the fresh ones in the future or that I was right to get the no pre cook ones, I\u2019m just trying to make sure I understand what the difference is and that she has also considered the differences. She then said that the way I was saying it was defensive and right fighting and that she felt I wasn\u2019t listening to her because I was asking all these questions rather than just saying \u201cyes dear\u201d.I continued to explain that I was just trying to understand and clarify, I wasn\u2019t defending that I was right to get those sheets or that I wouldn\u2019t get the fresh ones in the future but she said it didn\u2019t matter because of the way it was making her feel.She wasn\u2019t able to clarify what about my tone or words or mannerisms was making her feel that way rather than just feeling like I\u2019m trying to understand. So I don\u2019t know how to avoid this in the future but not just end up as a mindless \u201cyes dear\u201d robot. Am I the asshole because I tried to understand why she wanted fresh sheets instead of just noting to get fresh sheets next time?",

        "selftext": "I [19F] currently live with my Mum [52F] and 3 sisters [15F, 21F, 31F], but my Mum has made plans to move overseas in the next 6 months with my 3 sisters. She has wanted to move for years as the cost of living in our country is horrible, and she \u2018has nothing left here\u2019 (her parents passed away 2 years ago, and she is single).\u00a0 I was originally going to stay here and rent the current place we live in with my older sister [31],, and my BF [20], but my older sister has since decided that she wants to move with my mother, and that leaves me being unable to afford to live in our current house. I don\u2019t wish to leave as I have my whole life here; I just started UNI, my boyfriend and friends live here and my dog \u2018wouldn\u2019t make the trip\u2019. I am unable to work currently as I am chronically ill and am unsure of how my body would react to both full-time study and work. I get government assistance of $210/Weekly which will be unable to cover rent for anywhere but a single room in a share house but I won't be able to bring my dog. I am left in a position where I would have to financially rely on my BF more than I would like to and would be homeless if we ever broke up. I have brought these issues up to my mom and asked her for a bit more time until I qualify for student housing and can find a nice family to take my dog. However, everyone keeps saying that I am ruining this for her and that I should move overseas with them. She has dreamed of moving for years and is now \u2018able\u2019 to, but especially since her health is degrading, she is losing time to move. Should I give in and leave everything behind or do I stand my ground? EDIT:  Just want to clarify some things. - My relationship isn't new, its 2 years old.  - My dog isn't dying or old, she is just an anxious dog.  - My mom isn't actively dying, she is just getting old and has pre-existing health conditions.  - Yes, I could move to this new country but I would loose the specific program I got into that they do not offer there as well as my scholarship which would put me through Uni.  - I am currently applying to get more government assistance but it would only go into effect after she leaves  - I haven't had a job as my mother advised me not to and originally told me that she would financially support me through schooling  - pet friendly rentals are rare in Australia  - I cannot stay in my current house as the landlord doesn't want a first-time renter staying here.  - My family do not have anything lined up for them in the new place, no jobs, no education, no housing.   - I asked for them to postpone the move until the end of the year so that I can apply for student housing and rehome my dog    ",

        "selftext": "My partner and I live with her mom. She is very gracious in allowing us to live there so we can save money and buy a house. There is however, one complication. We have two cats, and when we moved in we asked that she gets rid of the toxic plants (she had a lot of lillies). Since we moved in two months ago, she has twice brought lillies home. Both times, we just said hey these are lillies can we move them, and she has no problem with that. Another time, she brought home a plant that was toxic, but I can't remember the name and it was shortly after she brought lillies home for the second time. A few days ago, she brought home a new plant that her friend gave her. I assumed that she had already checked the plant to see if it were toxic or not. Today, I looked it up myself and sure enough, its toxic to cats. When I approached her about the plant, I was respectful and just asked something like could you please check to see if the plants are toxic before you bring them in. Her response was saying that she felt attacked, that she didn't do anything wrong, and that because I helped unload her car, I should have seen the plant and looked it up then. (I didn't unload the plant from the car, just her heavy groceries from the trunk). We ended up getting in a heated argument. She was adamant that she did nothing wrong and that its my responsibility to look up the plants she brings in. I don't necessarily disagree, they are my cats and it is my responsibility...and I do look up all the plants she brings in. But after today being the third or fourth time she brought a toxic plant in...I just felt its not unreasonable to ask if she could look it up before hand. AITA? She does have obsessive personality disorder, so maybe her behavior has something to do with that? Or, maybe I'm just an asshole. Edit:  I should make it clear that\u2019s she is not a plant person. She only has like two plants in her house at any given time. She has one on the kitchen window sill( the one her friend gave her), and a bouquet of flowers on the kitchen island. She usually only has the flowers and changes them once a month",

        "selftext": "I (23F) have a friend (24F) who is currently in uni in another country. Her family is pretty strict so being far away from them made her go a little wild. Recently she was ranting to me about how her first kiss experience. She and her uni friends went clubbing, where she drank heavily and got drunk, but not drunk enough to fully black out, being still lucid enough to be aware of her surroundings and actions. According to her, this guy started approaching her, and they ended up grinding and eventually the guy kissed her, and it escalated into a full make out session.  The next morning she immediately regretted letting the guy do that to her and she called me for support.  While she described the story, it seemed like she wanted me to reassure her that the kiss didn\u2019t count or to sympathize with her. However, I found it hard to comfort her, or for sorry for what she experienced,  because firstly she knew her friends that went with her were going to be drinking heavily as well so there\u2019s no one looking out for her and she\u2019s going to be on her own. Secondly, she consented to the guy kissing her at that point (not saying no/pushing him/walking away) and also she kissed him back which was what caused the kiss to become a full make out session.  I knew she could\u2019ve done something because after the kiss happened the grinding continued and she began feeling uncomfortable about the guy starting to touch her inappropriately and so she walked away right away so it\u2019s not like she couldn\u2019t have done anything if she did not want him to kiss her. She just regretted giving away her first kiss to a total stranger who she doesn\u2019t even remember.  I didn\u2019t say much on the call and didn\u2019t offer the reassurance she seemed to be seeking. I felt conflicted because I think she willingly engaged in the situation and only regretted it afterward. However, I wonder if I was wrong for not being more supportive as her friend. I might be victim blaming as well for thinking that she should\u2019ve been more careful and responsible about her alcohol intake, knowing that she has no one watching out for her.  AITA? EDIT: I did not say much on the call as I was in complete shock that this happened to her. I was in no way judging her and I feel really bad that her first kiss (which is something she was looking forward to) was taken away like this. I am just wondering if I am the AH for not showing her the support that she wanted me to ie telling her it doesn\u2019t count as her first kiss. I did not tell her off or voice any of my \u201cjudgemental\u201d opinions I just listened.  EDIT 2: My friend asked me and I quote \u201cIt doesn\u2019t count right\u201d as to whether this is her first kiss experience or not I am not assuming anything.  ",

She's been putting off getting a job for a few weeks (she's applied to six over the past three weeks with no response) so my husband and I decided to put our feet down. We gave her until 8:00 PM to draft us a multi-week plan regarding how she plans to get a job (e.g. how many jobs a week? which jobs? etc.) She gave us a half-assed paper that said, apply to 3 jobs a week. We told her that this was unacceptable, and told her that she wasn't even really trying to get a job. She then asked us aggressively how many jobs\u00a0*we*\u00a0thought she should apply to, and I said that she should apply to 3 a day. My daughter then said, well then how am I supposed to devise a multi week plan if I'm already going to be applying to 21 jobs a week? We said that it's still a multi-week plan, consisting of applying to a total of 42 jobs over two weeks. She got very upset at us and cried and yelled, and locked herself in her bathroom for the rest of the night. It was also her job to do dishes today, and we reminded her with a text about this, to which she refused to do them. We didn't know what to do, and are threatening her with not letting her go to her friends debutante ball and winter formal after party.  I just want her to learn to be independent and prepared with some funds before she heads off to college: Am I the asshole?",

        "selftext": "Ok so I\u2019m really pissed off and disappointed at my bf of 10 years. On Thursday he had to fly from Canada to Jamaica for his grandpas funeral. He invited me to go but decided he wasn\u2019t going to bring me anymore, I was upset he didn\u2019t end up bringing me because he decided to fly with his brothers instead so whatever I had to just deal with it. We have never went on a trip outside of the country without each other so that\u2019s why it was disappointing. I even packed his suitcase and helped him convert money to Jamaican dollars and literally helped him with booking the ticket, even though again I was mad I still did it for him. He specifically told me he\u2019s not going down there for fun, said he\u2019s only there for the funeral and to mourn the death of his grandpa. Tell me why I check his location and he\u2019s at a fucking resort the day AFTER the funeral which is 4 hours away from his grandpas house? When I asked him he told me it\u2019s not a resort, he\u2019s at a hotel. LIES! I google it and it\u2019s a resort in negril, with a nice beach, pools, buffet, LOUD music. Who is he trying to fool? And yes that made me upset because again, he\u2019s there without me and I know he would be upset too if I did the same thing. And LIED about it. AGAIN, I was forced to get over it. So this is the cherry on top of why I\u2019m angry. Before he left to Jamaica, I sent him $200 Canadian dollars to cover what I asked for which was roasted breadfruit, which is hard to find here where I live. I specifically asked for 6 of them which cost less than $5 Canadian dollars. That\u2019s all I asked for. The only reason I asked for that was because I know his mom brings down so much food, she brings more than 6 roasted breadfruits, fruit, a lot of raw fish and bottles of wine and beer. So I know she had no issues going through customs. Tell me why he calls me today, I asked him what he bought me and all he bought me was 1 FUCKING BREADFRUIT. Mind you, I ASKED him and PAID for it so he can make it up to me by him excluding me on the trip. He told me he\u2019s going to have issues with customs and then called me ungrateful. I told him I only fucking asked for that and he didn\u2019t even try to make me happy considering how he excluded me and went to a fucking resort without me and tried to lie about it. Do I even have the right to be angry?? I told him he can keep it for himself and asked for my money back. AITA?Ps the reason I\u2019m so upset is because I have the biggest heart and do so much for him and spoil him and he doesn\u2019t even fucking try to reciprocate it back, I\u2019m not asking for the exact same but at least try. And he fucking didn\u2019t. ",

        "selftext": "An internet mutual and I had the idea to apply to artist alley tables at conventions together, because it's easier to take care of a table with two people (if one has to pee, the other can babysit the artwork).  He has experience as a vendor at Cons and I do not. So I thought he could be my guide and help me navigate all that stuff. I also thought that our chances of actually getting a table would be better because he already had that experience.  We've applied at the end of last year and by now we have been rejected by every single convention we have applied to. With one exception. One convention didn't allow shared tables so we applied separately and then planned to ask the Con to put our tables next to each other if both of us got accepted.   Well, he got a rejection and I was accepted. It's by far the biggest Convention we applied to with the most competition for the tables. And it is his Dream Convention he always wanted to vend at.  The two of us had found 3 more Conventions we'd like to try for before I got that accepted to the big Con. But since I got that acceptance letter I am thinking that I might have better chances of getting in if I apply alone.  I knew from the get go that the products he made were of lower quality than mine but I thought his vending experience would be more important to Cons than the quality of his things (turns out, most Cons don't even ask if you have prior experience and just look at the products).  Why I would be the asshole: Breaking a promise is bad and he has talked multiple times about how he just isn't good enough and about how sad he is about all the rejections. I don't want to add insult to injury.  Why I wouldn't be the asshole: It turns out that his vending experience is limited to small Conventions. It seems like in most cases he was accepted, because all applicants were accepted. I didn't know about this before we decided to share a table. I don't think he intentionally mislead me but I would have made a different decision if I had known.   And for him art is a hobby, for me it's my job. The stakes are higher for me because my income depends on it.  Would I be the asshole if I break the promise I made to apply together and tell him that I want to apply alone?    ",

I love it, and I think I got a great deal. A few days ago, my friend (also 25M) saw me with the bag and complimented it, asking where I got it.

        "selftext": "Last weekend, I had to fly out of town for my brother\u2019s funeral. He was a secret alcoholic and I hadn\u2019t seen him in 5 years. It was a rough trip. They had the idea that he would really like it if we went to an arcade bar and they kept buying drinks. I ended up having 5 voodoo rangers. The whole thing was weird. Because of the flight time and the location we ended up just staying the night at the airport. It was rough. Since I had no one else to help, I asked my best friend (let\u2019s call him Adam) and his girlfriend (let\u2019s call her Sue) to let my puppy out while I was gone.I was only supposed to be gone from Friday at 5 to Sunday at 3pm.  His parents (Mark and Lisa) also helped out. I called Adam and told him the instructions to take care of the pets, but I didn\u2019t leave a written list, which I now realize might have been a mistake. The original plan was for them to take him over to their house since he\u2019s about 3 months old. But Adam  didn\u2019t communicate that with his dad. And then the vet told us he had roundworm so that made it not possible for them because Mark  and Lisa\u2019s dog is old and they didn\u2019t want to risk it. When I got back, the first thing I noticed was that my puppy was in the wrong crate, he was covered in pee, and had chewed up the bed in that crate. So clearly, things weren\u2019t followed how I had asked. That already frustrated me on top of being hungover and exhausted and grieving. But I was too exhausted to deal with it at the time. My wife sent a thank-you text to Mark and Lisa but accidentally left out Adam and Sue. A little while later, Mark called me, asking about it and then straight-up asked if I was mad. The truth is, I was. because they didn\u2019t really do what I had asked. But instead of apologizing or acknowledging anything, Adam immediately shifted blame, saying it was my fault for not explaining things well enough, and got very pissed about me not saying thank you. Then Sue said I was being passive aggressive. Instead of saying something back I just told her that I\u2019d like to keep it between me and Adam because I originally asked him. I did shut her down but I didn\u2019t want her to get caught in the middle. That pissed her off royally though. Now, mutual friends are telling me I should smooth things over because Adam feels unappreciated and Sue feels disrespected. I do appreciate that they helped, but their reaction made me feel like they weren\u2019t being very understanding of what I had just gone through. AITA for not thanking them right away and for feeling put off by how they handled this? UPDATE: So I was going to Clarify on a couple things. 1. There was no neglect and that wasn't the point of the argument 2. I know I was frustrated over minor things. I would have never brought it up if it weren't for mark calling me and asking about it and pushed for an answer. 2. The reason my wife texted was because i was driving home and I fully intended on calling him personally to thank him and even joke around about my frustrations. I gave context in my post as to why I wanted to wait 3. I am appreciative of their help and I told them that when we were arguing, It did come off as not genuine. The whole thing got a lot bigger than I think needed to be and I didn't understand why. 4. I went ahead and talked to everyone and apologized for being frustrated and letting that overshadow my appreciation. Adam is still insisting that I should have just said thank you and bent the knee. The whole interaction I think is silly, but not worth being mad about. Puppies are a handful and he did a pretty good job all things considered.  5. Finally, some of y'all are out there. This was clearly a minor case of who the butthole is and coming at me saying I drank too much or that my wife carries the emotional burden is not needed. I definitely wasn't acting in the best way but I think a little grace is merited. I would really hesitate to wanna be friends with people who would kick you while your down. ",

        "selftext": "Throwaway account for obvious reasons I (F30) got married a few years ago, and for my wedding, I gave my sister, **Victoria** (F28), enough tickets to invite whomever she wanted no questions asked. The only condition was that she not invite one specific person my fiance really disliked. She understood, and it wasn\u2019t an issue since, although they were friends, she respected our wishes. Now, Victoria is getting married. Weddings in our culture are a *big* deal, huge family gatherings filled with food, music, and dancing, where extended relatives, family friends, and even distant acquaintances are often invited. It\u2019s not uncommon to have hundreds of guests, and the celebration is as much about community as it is about the couple. Victoria hasn\u2019t really asked me for input on the guest list, which I understand, she already knows who she wants there. The wedding is still 9 months away, and I\u2019ve only asked her to invite **one** person. Just one. That person is **Alice**, who is incredibly important to me, like a sister. I\u2019ve known her since i was 10, and she even invited Victoria to her own wedding. However, when I brought it up, Victoria told me she hadn\u2019t invited Alice and wasn\u2019t planning to, not because she dislikes her, but because she\u2019s already over her guest limit. She told me to \u201cwait and see\u201d if there\u2019s space later. Her reasoning is that she hasn\u2019t seen Alice in years and that Alice doesn\u2019t know her fiance, so she\u2019s not on the priority list. But what frustrates me even more is that Victoria keeps saying that it shouldn\u2019t matter because she has already invited some of my friends. While that is *partially* true, the reality is that those friends are also *her* friends, she invited them because she wanted them there, not because I asked her to. I even pointed this out and said, \u201cWell, if that\u2019s the case, then how about we swap out a third friend for Alice?\u201d Her immediate response was *no,* because that person is \u201cher guest\u201d and is definitely coming. I know it\u2019s not my wedding, it\u2019s Victoria\u2019s and her fiance\u2019s decision who they invite. I completely respect that. I\u2019m not angry or trying to demand anything, I just can\u2019t help but feel a little disappointed. With so many people being invite, it stings that Alice, who is like family to me, couldn\u2019t be included. Especially when I made accommodations for Victoria at my own wedding **AITA for insisting she make room for Alice?** EDIT: Since people keep saying. Alice has been a close family friend for 20 years. She and Vic even hung out without me many times so they are not randoms. EDIT 2: Maybe using insist was the incorrect term since everyone keeps pointing that out. We only had 1 conversation about this where I said Id like to have Alice in the guest list and she said no, then we talked about it for 5 more minutes before it ended and I asked her to let me know if she changed her mind. Edit 3: I should have mentioned that we are NOT American. In our culture its very normal that parents and siblings get to invite their friends to the wedding and you are usually sat with your guests during the banquet so its not that weird that I asked about a specific friend.

The other, Hannah, has a 4 y.o., Mikey. The baby shower is no kids but since I'm helping with planning and Mikey is family, I told Hannah she could bring Mikey. When I told Stephanie that Mikey was coming, she didn't say anything to me, but later called Hannah and asked if Hannah could find another option for Mikey. Stephanie said it's ok if he has to come but it's not a party for kids.  Hannah called me very upset that her son isn't wanted at the party, so I called Stephanie and told her she's being rude, needs to respect her family more, needs to apologize to Hannah, and should be happy Mikey is coming. She told me that this was between her and Hannah and that I should stay out of it. I said that I'm planning the party, so I don't have to stay out of it (I stayed out of it when Stephanie didn't invite all of her aunts/uncles to her wedding but I'm not staying out of this). She replied that she'd plan the party herself and uninvited me.  I'm just trying to help my daughters resolve their fight and plan a nice party. AITA?",

        "selftext": "My BIL (28M) used to live with his parents, paying \u00a330 a week for rent and food. About 18 months ago, he started spending more time at our place after his parents\u2019 dog turned on him. I offered him to move in with us so he could save enough to move out. My husband wasn\u2019t thrilled about the idea, but I thought it would only be for a few months. EDIT we made the decision together, i didn't go against my husband's wishes we didn\u2019t have a spare room, so set him up in our 11y/o son\u2019s room with a foldout bed. We agreed on \u00a3160 a month, which covered bills/food. However he quickly started complaining about doing the dishes (only chore we asked him to do) and spent his money on nights out and other stuff instead of saving to move out. After a few months, it was clear he wasn't saving at all. When brought up, my husband said BIL had until March to move out, he was shocked by the deadline. We offered until end of August, with rent increased to \u00a3250 a month, which he agreed to. But he would consistently ignore basic requests: keeping the bathroom window open when showering to avoid mould, picking up his dirty clothes, keeping his stuff in our son's room organised and not sleeping in the living room overnight, we spend 80% of our time in that room, it's a family room NOT a bedroom. By august, BIL is no closer to moving out which i KNEW would happen. Instead, he booked a holiday, started saving for that, showing he can save and taking us for complete mugs. Rent went to \u00a3400 a month, hoping that would encourage him to leave because we can't just throw him out. He viewed a place, it fell through, and he blamed his friend- told us WE should be having a go at his friend instead as if WE'RE responsible for him. He\u2019s now been living with us nearly 18 months, paying low rent considering everything is included (even toiletries as he has not bought any since moving in). He works full-time and makes above minimum wage. I no longer like being around him, i find him rude, entitled and arrogant. The tension has caused strain between me and my husband, I\u2019ve tried to talk to him about it (A LOT), but he doesn\u2019t want to aggravate the situation, even though he agrees with me. I\u2019m frustrated because every time i broach the subject i feel dismissed and i just need to put up with it until he moves out, even if it means letting BIL act/talk to me in a disrespectful manner. My husband isn't afraid of confrontation but can't be bothered with it as we're stuck with him in house. As he doesn't back me up BIL doesn't take me seriously and i feel like I\u2019m not being supported in my own home. He's had enough of me going on about it, I've had enough of dealing with the whole thing. BIL is due to move out in 4 weeks-he's moving into his friend's (+ friends gf and 4 kids) attic as he never looked for anywhere, the whole situation has left me emotionally drained. I\u2019m wondering if I\u2019m overreacting or if my feelings are justified. Our friends agree BIL is miserable to be around and I\u2019m tired of the cr*p i'm putting up with, should i continue to let it go over my head?",

        "selftext": "My (26F) parents own the 2-bedroom condo I live in, and my boyfriend (28M) moved in a few months ago. We discussed rent beforehand, and he was fine with paying. I initially told him $1800,  in addition to splitting utilities 50/50. He agreed. For context, comparable 2-bedroom condos in our area (a desirable part of Southern California) rent for around $2800, meaning $1400 per person. My parents aren't charging *me* rent, which is incredibly generous. However, they see the condo as an investment property, and the rent they would charge me is factored into their financial planning. I send them a portion of the rent I collect every month. I also pay the HOA dues and property taxes (which are substantial in California). Everything was fine for a few months. Then, my boyfriend was looking at rental listings and realized that *individual* rooms in comparable condos are going for around $1400. He also found out (from me, I wasn't hiding it) that I technically don't pay rent myself since my parents own the place. He completely flipped out. He accused me of trying to profit off him, saying I'm taking advantage of him because I'm not paying rent. He argues that since I don't have a rent payment, the $1800 is mostly profit for me. He thinks he should only pay half of what *I* pay in combined HOA dues, property taxes and utilities. I admitted that the $1800 wasn't just based on splitting a theoretical $2800 rent. I told him I added a bit extra because I'm the one paying the HOA fees and property taxes, and I\u2019ve been responsible for general upkeep of the place. I also have to send a portion of the rent money to my parents. I acknowledged that it's more than half of what a comparable room would cost. He's not having it. He keeps saying I'm ripping him off and that I should only charge him half the combined HOA, taxes, and utilities. He\u2019s now refusing to pay the agreed-upon $1800 and is only offering what he calculates as his share of the combined HOA, taxes, and utilities. I feel like I'm being reasonable. I'm not trying to get rich off him. I'm just trying to cover the actual expenses associated with the condo. Am I the asshole here? Should I just lower the rent to appease him, even though I feel like I'm not doing anything wrong? This is making things incredibly awkward. EDIT: There is no mortgage. My parents bought the place cash as investment property. I have been living here rent free for about 8 years and have done some remodeling at the time, and have had friends as roommates here and there whom i also charged rent, but usually those cases were when those friends were suffering financially so they paid under market value.  My parents did not ask me to charge my boyfriend rent or for me to send them money, they basically say it's my choice to use the place as I want for now.  I send them 1k a month because technically it is their place and so I feel they should get a share of the rent. EDIT - UPDATE   For everyone assuming/asking if I am pocketing the money. NO I AM NOT.  It;s like this:  I send 1k to my parents since it's their place, and every time I've had a roommate I've sent them a portion of the rent without them having to ask. BECAUSE they bought this place as an investment property. I was originally going to fic it up and rent it out but stayed longer than I planned and they have never charged me rent. So I am holding them back from it being a full time rental property so of my own initiative I am sending them rent whenever I have roommates before they can ask me for it.  1k to parents $500 - HOA dues  $100-150/mo utilities Property taxes - somwehere between 5-10k/year So I'm usually left with $150-200 every month after paying my parents and HOA and utilities, and even combined over a year it would still not cover even half the property taxes, which I am willing to keep covering fully myself.   I am not pocketing anything or making any money from what I charge my boyfriend for rent. ",

        "selftext": "Me (29f) and my boyfriend (33m) live in a huge house with 3 other guys (all in their 30\u2019s). The owner sold the house and gave us 60 days to move out. The law in my city states we get 2 free months of rent in these situations. (15K in our situation)  But the new owner wants us out faster than that and offered us $30K to be out at the end of the month. We took it but now we have to divvy up the money. My thinking is we should take the first 15K and divide it by what we pay for rent normally, then the extra 15K on top will be split evenly 5 ways.  Everyone else thinks we should split the entire 30K by how everyone pays rent. Which i think is ridiculous, because that extra $15K was never part of the plan. No one should be entitled to a percentage of something they didn\u2019t pay into? They\u2019re thinking about it like a business, an investment. But rent is a bill, not a business. That extra money came about purely bc of a situational issue, not bc more money was \u201cinvested\u201d I feel taken advantage of by my friends and even my own boyfriend.

        "selftext": "Hi so currently I\u2019m in a situation and I\u2019d like an outside perspective as my family think I\u2019m an asshole!! Sorry in advance if there is any spelling mistakes and punctuation errors, I\u2019m typing this fast as my wife is getting our daughter ready for bed. So I Adam (19M) is married to Keeley (19F) and between us we have a little girl Iris (3F) turning 4 in a few weeks. Keeley and I got married last year after being together for 6 almost 7 years - we got together at 13 and we have been friends since the age of 10 . During our entire friendship and beginning of our relationship Keeley had no minim/ non existent relationship with her dad - he pretty much abandoned her and her siblings and from what she\u2019s told me over the years, he was an absent father throughout her entire childhood. Keeley\u2019s mum met her step dad when Keeley was around 6, and from then on her dad became even more absent and when he would have her and the siblings, she would be the one looking after everyone when only being the middle child. During last year\u2019s wedding preparations Keeley\u2019s dad wanted to walk her down the aisle on her wedding day. I didn\u2019t see the problem with that but Keeley was set in her ways and told me and her entire extended family that her step dad was going to walk her down the aisle and if anyone had a problem with it they would have been uninvited to the wedding. Fast forward to now, I\u2019ve been meeting with her dad, we will call him Ben (46M) every couple of weeks to catch up and update him on how iris and Keeley is getting along ( iris is in nursing and Keeley is going to uni in September to be a nurse). This week when I met up with Ben he expressed a desire to get to know his granddaughter as he said \u201che doesn\u2019t know how long he\u2019s got left) let me preface this by saying Ben has tried to use this tactic over the last to get Keeley to talk to him and as Keeley told me he used this as an excuse when she was kid, when she wouldn\u2019t do something he wanted.. but I don\u2019t know if he is being honest or if he is actually gonna die soon. I guess I want Keeley to talk to her dad, as I didn\u2019t have a dad growing up, my dad died when I was 9 years old - that\u2019s the reason we moved and then that\u2019s when I met Keeley. He wants me to bring iris to our meet ups or ask Keeley to hear him out. After the conversation I went to my mums house to ask for advice and she said i definitely shouldn\u2019t bring up this up to keeley and to stop meeting up with ben. I\u2019m considering just telling keeley everything and dealing with the fall out afterwards.So Reddit, Would I be the asshole if I asked my wife to talk to her dad? I don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t think of this but this is the only relationship I\u2019ve ever been in and I\u2019m actually super close to her step dad.  Edit - hello everyone! I just want to say thank you for all the comments and messages I\u2019ve received. Firstly, I wanna address people this story and account fake - I can assure you it is not, this is my real life and the account is a burner account as I do have a normal Reddit account and I have done since I was 15 Keeley just follows that one so I had to make a new one to address this matter. Secondly, people saying my story doesn\u2019t match up with our ages, we had our daughter at 16, which is almost 4 years ago, I turn 20 on the 16th January and then iris turns 4 on the 25 of February and then the following month Keeley turns 20. Keeley is starting uni in September as she took some time out of education to be 100% present for iris first 9 months that\u2019s the reason she is going. Also when I say iris is in nursery, I mean it\u2019s like a play group thing she goes to everyday, my mother in law takes her for a few hours while I\u2019m at work and my wife is at college. I just also wanna preface this by saying No, iris was never planned, we never planned to have kids till at least our twenty\u2019s, but when we found out Keeley was pregnant we had a long talk and decided that we both could do it and she\u2019s an amazing mum. In the last 3 years Ben has had nothing to do with Iris - as some messages were saying - and it wasn\u2019t due to my wife\u2019s lack of trying, he didn\u2019t want have that relationship with her. Lastly, after reading through all you\u2019re comments I can clearly tell I\u2019m a huge arsehole, Keeley has no idea I\u2019ve been meeting with her father and as some of you have said it\u2019s a huge breach of trust which is completely is. A lot of you are saying that he is using the situation with my dad against me and I never thought of this until it was mentioned. When thinking back to our meetings I can definitely say this is the case, him bringing up how, he thinks that my relationship with my dad would be now or how my own fathers relationship with my daughter would be. The people saying that this is a reason for Keeley to leave/ divorce me is a bit far fetch, Keeley is an understanding woman and she would never do something like that unless it was absolutely necessary. I\u2019m writing this on the way to wok. Tonight when I get him I\u2019m gonna to show Keeley this post, comments and all the messages I\u2019ve received and we shall go from there. I wanna say thank you to everyone who took the time to read this post, even tho I\u2019m a hide asshole. ",

Our kids have never been the best of friends or even got along that well most the time, they would bicker and argue with each other call each other names and do things they knew annoyed the other to purposefully get under their skin.  I don't want to go in to detail but we've had some financial issues lately that caused a bit of a strain on our marriage, we would argue a lot late at night when the kids were in bed and often wouldn't go to bed ourselves until 2 or 3 :am ( even when we had work the next day).  I'm ashamed to say that it turns out our kids would often wake up and hear our late night arguments and this actually gave our daughter nightmares, I found this out when I went to wake my son and saw his sister in bed with him, that's when he told me she had a nightmare and got in bed with him because my husband and were still up fighting.  This broke my heart to know we made our daughter scared and weren't  there to comfort her,  we made sure to keep our arguments as quiet as possible and reasured our daughter that sometimes mommy and daddy fight but she didn't need to worry about that and everything would be okay.  We kept our arguments to a minimum and were as quiet as possible, but our daughter still had nightmares the next few nights and got in bed with her brother.  We were able to get a handle on our financial issues and stop fighting so much. We reassured the kids that  everything would be okay and that they didn't have to worry. After a few nights our daughter was back to sleeping in her owne bed.  Ever since then our kids have gotten much closer, they play together, watch shows together, goof around together, and treat each other with much more love and respect then they used to. They even hug each other goodnight every night.  They still have arguments and bicker but it's much less and they  have an overall very loving relationship.  Today my daughter drew her brother a picture of the two of them playing in our yard with the words  best big brother in the world written really big on top.  My son loved it and showed it to us and asked if we could have it framed, as I mentioned we have been having financial issues lately and I really don't think we could afford to frame it.  I told him he didn't need to frame it, he could just hang it up on the wall. But he said he wanted to frame it because special pictures get framed and this is the most special picture he has. I tried to tell him gently that we can't afford to frame it but he and his sister are still upset.  I asked my husband about it and he said maybe we should get it framed because it's so special to our son and there new found closeness could maybe be hurt by us refusing to frame it.  The last thing I want to do is hurt there new close relationship but I still don't think we can afford to get it framed.  AITA? Edit: We went to Walmart and got our son a frame for his sister's picture, we put it up on his wall right across from where his bed is and he absolutely loves it!  We're very glad his relationship with his sister is so much better and seeing her picture for him everyday means so much to him. We're so glad we were able to get a frame for him.  Some of you seemed to get the idea we were just cheap or that we just didn't want to spend money on the kids, that's absolutely not the case. The kids have lots of toys, their owne bikes and phones and of course all the essentials.  My husband and i didn't realize that there were options for cheap picture frames but we were delighted to find out there were.  Thank you all! ",

In a hasty decision to have everything settled, I kept the division of property and debt as simple as possible - I take care of my credit cards, she takes care of her credit cards, car and car loan. (If it matters, we're divorced in Nevada, US). Years later, I filed for bankruptcy because I was struggling to pay the debt (about $15k) we accumulated together. As stated in the divorce decree, she is responsible for the car and car loan. However, I am primary, and she is co-signer. Both of our names are on the title and registration. Eventually, I know she'll need something from me like a signature for the car. She refuses to refinance because she doesn't want to meet with me. Mutual friends have been saying I should have collected money from her for partial amount of the debt. I don't have as good of a job as she does now.  WIBTA if I asked for money to settle the car situation? Is this even legal? The debt covers some furniture in her home, along with fast food, trips we've done together, ect. We were reckless young adults. I've learned my lesson.",

        "selftext": "For context, I have been with my girlfriend for 11 years and I turned vegan 3 years ago for ethical reasons. Before that, I was not eating a lot of meat, but I knew that I was not really doing the best thing (ethically). I was not vegan because I did not want to create any friction with family, friends, etc. but at some point, I decided to go vegan. For me, it doesn't make sense to kill/harm animals when I can just buy a can of chickpeas or buy some tofu instead. My girlfriend understands this and stayed omnivore, because she doesn't want to give up on things that she loves to eat. We live together so, me switching up to veganism obviously impacted her since we cook together only vegan/vegan adaptable meals. She sometimes buys cheese, milk, chicken and fish that she cooks for herself. Other than being vegan, I have a full time job and have many hobbies that take a lot of my time (competing in Ironmans, learning multiple languages, etc), so it is a struggle to spend a lot of good quality time with my girlfriend. Anyway, on her birthday, I came late from work and I went to a restaurant where they make some Poke bowls. I wanted to make her happy and knew that if she was with me, she would order the salmon poke bowl, but I ended up ordering a vegan Poke bowl anyway, because I did not think her birthday would justify me spending money on an industry that I really don't want to encourage. I felt that even tough it would no be her choice, it would still be a nice gesture. When I came back home with the vegan poke bowls, she was disappointed and kind of angry at me because she knew exactly what went in my head when I bought the bows. She felt that even on her birthday, I could not do any compromise and think solely about what she wanted. She says that even when I give something to somebody else, I don't put myself purely in their heads and that I always filter my actions based on MY standards. What do you think ? Edit : Thank you for all your comments. I am a selfish a*hole and definitely have to work on being a better boyfriend and a better person in general. My girlfriend is a wonderful person and I mistreated her. I will put myself more in her shoes next time I want to treat her and put myself and my standards out of the way. ",

I thought this happened naturally, (not hanging out as much / not talking over instagram etc.) but she felt hurt by the distance. We \u201cbroke up\u201d over text after the she sent l an incredibly long \u201cwhat did I do?\u201d to which I responded in summary \u201cnothing really, I feel like we\u2019re just in different parts of life. I wish you the best though!\u201d I realize now this text was the opportunity she wanted to launch into a diatribe of all the things I did wrong in the relationship and that she felt offended by. I had NO idea. One of these things was a miscommunication about driving to the airport. (A year and a half ago!) She messaged me in August 2023 about driving her to the airport at 6 in September. I said sure, even though this is something that I would not normally ask of a friend (I would ask my mom for or get an uber. Gas is expensive!) but I thought \u201cwell, she doesn\u2019t have a lot of family here\u201d so I said sure, you can get me a coffee and we\u2019ll call it even. I\u2019m a morning person so I figured she was asking me to drive her at 6 am. If I had known she meant 6pm I would have not agreed in the first place.  So flight day arrives and I roll up to her place at 6. I call her. Dial tone. Finally I get a hold of her and she says that the flight was at 6pm. We both apologized for the misunderstanding. I go back home to bed. I get up for work and am feeling (understandably?) tired and a bit grumpy. I send her a text saying \u201chey, I\u2019m not upset at you, but I am a bit grumpy about this miscommunication and am going to have to politely decline to drive you at 6pm tonight to rest\u201d I gave her notice and she replied \u201ctotally fair, I\u2019m so sorry for the mix up!\u201d and she sent me a starbucks giftcard for my trouble, which was a sweet but totally unnecessary gesture. She got to the airport, I wished her a nice vacation, and we caught up when she got back. I thought all was well.  Folks, all was not well. She had apparently held on to this resentment as \u201cI broke a promise\u201d to her. She said me cancelling was selfish cause she couldn\u2019t afford an uber and was shocked that I didn\u2019t rearrange my schedule to drive her at 6pm. She apparently had to take a bus and then get another friend to drive her \u201cwho dropped everything for her\u201d. She was flabbergasted that she \u201csent me the giftcard and then I cancelled! WHO DOES THAT?!\u201d Apparently I didn\u2019t prioritize her and didn\u2019t care about her feelings and wellbeing as I knew how much this trip meant to her. I looked back and she sent me the giftcard after I declined to drive her. I thought it was a nice gesture at the time, but now I feel like she felt like I owed it to her to say \u201caww, since you got me coffee I WILL drive you now\u201d. I thought this was a simple favour that I could revoke cause circumstances changed and not \u201ca promise\u201d. I am doubly confused cause she said over text that it was fine at the time. Am I the asshole for not realizing this was a dealbreaker? ",

He asks me if we would be able to share the machine and alternate between sets. I politely declined and had not specified any reasons as I did not want to come across as rude.

I (19 M) was talking to my coworker (26 F) about how my ex stepdad/My brother's dad was supposed to help me move in one Friday (he offered because I was living with him), but when I called to ask him if he was ready and he was confused on what I was meaning and he didn't know we would be doing it so early in the day. (it was a little before noon but he was told a week before when and what day) He had to go to one of his younger kids school to have birthday lunch with her which was fine I said we could do it after, but his now girlfriend ( not my mom) said I was trying to ruin her daughters bday and I was an asshole and must of planned it. So he hung up called me back and asked if he could do it Saturday, but I had to stay at a family friends house to watch their dogs and so I said that was fine and I would send him a picture of how I wanted it since I couldn't be there to help him or do it myself. Well he had got there threw it in my room not at all how I sent him and my roomates family had to do it because they felt bad.  I was upset more because they had to do it and I didn't say anything to him about it and still thanked him for doing it... but my coworker said I was an asshole for trying to make him  set up my whole house and I was being entitled. I feel like considering I had it all planned for him but he forgot about it inconveniencing me and then I couldn't be there I was in my rights to be frustrated with him... So am I the Asshole?  edit-  I feel like people are coming at me because I started a fight with him or something but like the the oh post I thanked him for doing it and offered gas to which he said no to, I didn\u2019t argue with him about it but I feel I should still be able to be upset that he didn\u2019t do it when he said he would and told my roommate and her family he knew how I wanted it but didn\u2019t care to do and said I wouldn\u2019t mind in left.  obviously I do mind and he didn\u2019t put like pictures or thing small things like that for me up he just had to put a bed and my desk in there and that was it.

We planned a huge brunch for our friends to ask them to be a part of our wedding party back in March of 2024. Everyone of course said yes, however, as time went on, a groomsman needed to back out so we needed to backfill the position to make it equal for our wedding party to walk down the aisle. Of course, it didn't bother me that my brother-in-law was not initially asked because my finance does have a lot closer friends that he has been friends with for years and we hang out with every weekend. When going over who my fiance was going to add to his side of our wedding party, he mentioned asking another friend of his, I told him it should be my brother-in-law and not his old best friend. Some background, my fiance and my brother-in-law are pretty close, we see him and my sister quite often as my sister is one of my best friends, and our kids (6) are the same age and hang out all the time. This friend that my fiance wanted to add to his wedding party was a really good friend of ours when we first started dating, he and his now finance were some of our best friends that we hung out with every weekend, however, we stopped hanging out with them both for about two years as the friend would make comments about me being a stay at home mom and living off my finance. Me and my fiance both agreed that I would be a stay-at-home mom while I finished college. Fast forward to today, we reconnected with our friends and after a serious apology from my fiance's friend we started to become a part of each other's lives, We only see them maybe once or twice a month, so I was confused as to why my fiance would want him in our wedding over my brother-in-law. I understand that they were best friends for years, and this is his side of the wedding party but my brother-in-law has always been there for us and never has done us wrong. So am I the asshole for asking my fiance to have my brother-in-law over his old best friend?",

We have been dating for a couple years now and recently he moved in with me. I bought the house and pay the mortgage for it entirely. My BF does not pay me any rent since he is currently in a low paying job and actively looking for better options. However he also has the longer commute to work so he pays more for gas now ever since he moved in because previously he lived closer to his workplace. Until he finds a new job, he told me he unable to contribute for the mortgage and hasn't asked to be on the deed either. He does however pay half the utilities and half of the groceries too. He has been extra conscious about not contributing to the mortgage or paying any rent. Since he doesn't pay rent, he tries to make up for it by doing almost all of the cooking for both of us. He also does the laundry and dishes most of the times without complaint. And when I ask him for help cleaning the house like mopping the floors, he helps with that too. He also packs my lunch every morning to save me the trouble of getting up early. I am really lucky that he does all of this. However, he does make a mess (kitchen and bathroom) and his cleaning isn't as good as when I would do it. We also buy a lot of groceries which we have nowhere to put since the house is somewhat small which makes the house a mess again. I didn't have this problem when I was living by myself so it has started to irritate me quite a bit over time. This past weekend, when he was cooking, he happened to drop rice and some sauce on the floor and hadn't cleaned up after so I told him you need to be more careful about dropping things on the floor cause you make a mess sometimes. It caused him to get upset and he started profusely cleaning the floors. Then he proceeded to tell me I know this is your house, but it feels like I need to tiptoe around you here because I am not keeping the place exactly how you want it. I make a mess sometimes but I always clean up after. Might not be immediately but I do get to it and I do my best. I'm sorry that isn't good enough. And this isn't the first time you've said this. He told me the other time this happened was when he was cleaning out our oven and while scrubbing the burnt bits, it dropped black spots all over the white floor which irritated me. And apparently I had told him that he didn't do a good job cleaning the floor one time when I had asked him to do it. After he told me all this, I got upset because and started crying and he spent the next hour consoling me. I am neurotic about keeping the place clean - especially my kitchen since I have had a rodent problem. Ever since this, I have always found him on all fours on the kitchen floor trying to find every last speck of food because I feel like he is convinced that I would get upset again. AITA for telling him he made a mess in the first place and wanting to keep my house clean? EDIT: Clarified being on the deed EDIT 2: I deleted all my replies to the comments because I kept getting downvoted on every single one. I don't understand the downvotes to my replies when I have only thanked the commenters, been civil with my replies and taken their suggestions as good ones and agreeing to make some changes in myself.

        "selftext": "I broke up with my ex three years ago, but I still had a teddy bear from him. I didn\u2019t take it with me when I moved to the city where I study, I left it at my mom\u2019s house. Since it was fluffy and comfortable, she started sleeping with it every night. After spending a year abroad, I came back to my hometown for a month. Every time I saw that teddy bear, it reminded me of my ex and the moment he gave it to me, so I decided to throw it in the fire without asking my mom. I didn\u2019t think she was that attached to it, I only considered that I didn\u2019t want anything from my ex in the house anymore. Three days later, my mom asked about the teddy bear. When I told her I had burned it, she got really emotional, even to the point of crying. She said she had slept with it every night for the past three years, that it was really comfortable, and that it helped calm her breathing and anxiety. I genuinely hadn\u2019t considered how much it meant to her. I told her I\u2019d buy her a new one, but I haven\u2019t been able to find the exact same one yet. AITA for burning it without asking her first? EDIT: It was not just the teddy bear that I threw, it were all the things I had home from him, and not because I am angry at him or not moved on, but I did not want to have them anymore. I only mentioned the teddy bear as my mom was attached to it, thing I was not aware of.",

We both even applied to a lot of top scholarship (QuestBridge, Gates, Coca-Cola, etc) and made it to finalist stages for QuestBridge together. In December, Jane matched to Duke University and only had to pay $10,000 over the course of four years. I did not get matched, so I did not receive the scholarship, but made finalist for the Gates Scholarship. This didn't tear our friendship apart but instead brought us closer--I was sad, of course, but I was happy for her. Fast forward to earlier today. She heard back from another big scholarship, and I told her to rescind her application as she already has QuestBridge. She did. Then, she heard back from another, and I told her, again, that she didn't need the money and to leave the opportunity for someone else who did. A couple hours passed, and she comes up to me asking for help with her essay, and I look at it with her. Then, she tells me that it was highly inconsiderate of me to tell her to rescind her applications, especially because I knew how much she needed it. At this point, I had taken two exams back-to-back, and was fed up w ppl. So I told her how it wasn't fair for people like me who didn't get matched, but deserved the money just as much as her. She then says how they have medical bills back from when her mom had cancer, and that it wasn't fair to her family that they pay for her school. I said that she could take a job, both during the summer and in college, so that they don't have to pay for her, but she stormed off. Now, I'm scared that I ruined our friendship, especially with something as small as this.  So, AITA?",

His place of employment has historically not been a positive place and has been the cause of deep stress for him and strain on our relationship; however, it was recently bought out so company ownership is different and this new position would be kind of a fresh start. He let me know about his new position after he accepted it yesterday. He said that he cares how I feel about it and that he knows it has been rough but he thinks this will be a good thing. I do have mixed feelings, but I am incredibly happy for him and proud and I let him know that. I let it sit and gathered my feelings about all of it and then tried to talk to him about it today. I told him that I am happy and excited for him and that I want to support him in this, want to ensure we respect each other\u2019s feelings, and communicate so we can move forward positively together. He lost it. He said that I hate his job and will never be happy, that he does not want to discuss it - ever -, that he should not have to be my therapist and talk to me about it\u2026 the list goes on. I repeatedly told him I am happy and that I am not upset or angry and that it was a conversation about moving forward with mutual respect and positivity and I did not understand why he was angry and asked if he could tell me what he is upset about so I can try and understand. He could not tell me and just kept saying he never wants to discuss it and that I just always cause problems and am never happy. I am at a loss. I told him I apologize if I miscommunicated somehow, but I literally just wanted him to know that I support him and that even though it has been tough there I want us to move forward supporting and respecting each other (that is the text I sent him verbatim). AITA here? ** update - the stress and strain I refer to is that he has been so stressed he has stopped taking care of himself, going to workouts (which he loves), being angry at everything and snapping at everything all the time. He knows he is doing that and apologize saying he is sorry and that he is just stressed and needs to find a new job because he can\u2019t take it, feels disrespected there, and feels terrible for taking it out on our family. So it has affected our family. ",

I tried to understand why she lost feelings, asked her what she wanted to do. Take a break? End things completely? She would ALWAYS tell me i dont know.

We were in this situation for like 3 days, i wanted answers, a reason why she wanted to leave me, what she wanted to do from here, but i got none.

Mind you, this is all over text... we live 20 min away from each other but okay.

She had her big birthday 4 day ski trip cancelled because of weather and is pissed because she had been planning it for a while. She made a big deal out of it because in her eyes she never got to celebrate anything. We went for a meal and karaoke but she didn\u2019t feel like it was enough of a celebration.  Tbh our family isn\u2019t big on celebrating anything but my sister kind of brought it on herself. My sister put a lot more pressure on herself when she was younger because everyone told her she was a genius. She skipped grades and graduated high school at 16. She didn\u2019t attend prom because she was younger than the other students so even though she was a senior she hung out with student her own age more so she didn\u2019t have friends to go with. Plus if I remember correctly she had AP exams afterwards so she spent that night studying because at that point she needed an A in every subject. She always says it was her biggest regret in life. Our parents didn\u2019t put that on her she was just over the top back then. I think it\u2019s overblown because she is very successful now in a job that\u2019s hard to get into so it\u2019s not like her hard work wasn\u2019t rewarded. Tons of people work hard without much to show for it which is worse.   She was complaining to me constantly about her 30th being ruined and said she only has her wedding to look forward to now (she isn\u2019t engaged yet but probably will be this year). I told her she shouldn\u2019t put so much on the wedding and it\u2019s just an expensive party which she can afford yes but it\u2019s still a lot to be putting on a single day. She said it\u2019s her last chance to celebrate something and all the achievements she had has been pushed aside to make room for the next thing and she wants her wedding to be memorable like her 30th was suppose to be but in a good way. She mentioned again skipping prom as an example and I told her that skipping prom to study is kind of a humble brag but more so it\u2019s not a big deal. I went to prom and honestly it wasn\u2019t that interesting, I get she missed it and it sucks but she has way better things in life rn. She got mad and said I got a lot more things celebrated than her so I don\u2019t understand what it\u2019s like to go back and realize there isn\u2019t even a single photo of the event.

I\u2019m planning to use this money for an iPad for university\u2014 (waiting for an new model is coming out in about 7-8 months) \u2014and I\u2019m worried that if I dip into my own money, I might not have enough left for 10% of the cost of an iPad by the time it comes out. By the way, my dad works extremely hard to get us into private schools and pay houses. He also owns a few small companies, and sometimes he needs to borrow money.  However, I would say we are decently well off and my two brothers recently got the IPhone 16 Pro Max (I didn\u2019t get one, but he offered to one day get me an MacBook to make it even). For university, I would heavily prefer an IPad over an MacBook but I feel like it would be harder without an MacBook, which is why I would wanna take out my own money for an iPad along the MacBook.  AITA?",

        "selftext": "So me (18M) and my girlfriend (18F) has been together a just over a year now, and we both have eachothers phone passcodes. Early on in the relationship I've established that I don't agree with obsessing with celebrities or saving videos of someone you find attractive on social media if you have a partner - she agreed and didn't have a problem with this. A couple times however I've found her doing this. One time she thought I was asleep, she was on her phone and I saw she had a bunch of thirst traps saved (all of the same actor). When I pretended to wake up she deleted them as quick as she could which I found very odd, because now it seems she's trying to hide it. That was half a year ago, but yesterday whilst she was sleeping, I went on her Tiktok. Initially I went on it to troll a mutual friend of ours, I was going to send them a silly message but then I saw that my girlfriend had been sending this friend thirst traps of that same actor from before saying things like Silent repost because my boyfriend would be upset or I fear I would fall for this man but don't tell my boyfriend I said that. I felt so disrespected because she's actively trying to hide it, and this is something she KNEW I would be upset by. Anyways, I then went through her favourited videos and as I thought, a bunch of thirst traps and edits of the same guy over and over again. I know people are going to say You violated her privacy, you clearly didn't trust her in the first place but we've given eachother our passcodes so I don't think it's that problematic, she could've gone through my phone too. Let me know if that's a wrong way of thinking. I confronted her and she smiled and laughed and said you've made yourself sad now why would you do that. She saw I wasn't happy and changed her demeanor, and said she didn't know what to say. We talked and I said how I felt betrayed, she crossed a boundary and how I thought it was disgusting that she was fully aware she was doing something I wasn't comfortable with and tried to hide it. We didn't get into an argument, we were laying in bed saying things individually, taking long pauses to think of what to say, no shouting just calm discussion. When she got home, her parents asked why she was upset and she told them the situation but her parents are very angry at me for going through her phone in the first place, and said that I didn't trust her. She also texted me saying she also thought the same thing but didn't want to tell me when we were hanging out because she didn't want to make the situation worse. I haven't told her I wasn't even planning on going through her phone in the first place but rather just wanted to troll that friend of ours. I know that I should've just left it at that and ignored the videos she sent, rather than going through her favourites. I just want opinions on the situation, am I the asshole for having gone through her phone, or am I right in saying she's in the wrong for having crossed a boundary?",

        "selftext": "So basically 2023 was a really tough time for me emotionally speaking. My grandpa's brother, who we often visited and had great conversations, died in January. That was a really big factor of my mental state, but there were other factors as well. To summarize, my grades were really bad and I was extremely sad and hopeless for the longest continuous period of time in my life, ever.  So, I decided, for some reason, that I'll talk about my problems in the class group chat. The response was immediately dismissive. The crux was that I didn't know what exactly is the problem, I just knew something is very much off. So my classmates were like Why are you talking about your problems if you don't even know what they are? We can't help you if we don't know what you need help with.    In my messages I would describe myself as having a breakdown/tantrum. And I just want to say, I am aware that just because I was in a tough mental state it doesn't mean I'm allowed to drag my classmates into it and do whatever I want. But overall, this has been on my mind a lot since it has happened, and I just want to know what others think. From both sides of the fence.  Thank you!",

        "selftext": "So, this just happened, bear with me while I collect my thoughts.  Today my mother recieved a message from her step nephew. Her brother, my uncle, married a woman who already had 2 kids. He cared for them as if they were his own and we've always been close, even though they live in another country.  The message read something along the lines of Tell your family never to speak to my mother again. You should be ashamed of yourselves. Tell your parents their son would be ashamed of them. We were so confused. For context, we are currently on vacation that my grandparents paid for. Just immediate family, my grandparents, my parents, my brother, my husband, me and my son.  My uncle passed away a few years ago and since then, my mother communicates regularly with my aunt. We face timed her for Christmas. Up until that message, we had no indication anything was wrong. Now my aunt won't answer her calls and her step nephew is refusing to elaborate. Here comes the part where I might become an asshole. My mom has asked us not to tell my grandparents. My dad, brother and husband all know. I know because I was there when my mom got the message. I told my husband and my mom told my dad and my brother.  I think my grandparents deserve to know. I think they could shed light on what happened. My nana talks to my aunt all the time, so maybe something happened? They are napping right now, so it will be a little while before I have the opportunity.  We have speculated on causes but we really have no clue.  So, WIBTA if I went against my mom's wishes and told my grandparents about the message? Update: I spoke to my mom again. All of that side of the family has blocked her on all social media. They have not blocked anyone else, at least as far as I know. My aunt has not blocked or unfriended me, nor has her daughter or granddaughter. I hadn't noticed (I'm not on Facebook much) but the one who sent the message, his wife unfriended me at some point. No idea when. We still don't have an explanation, but I thought you guys might like an update. I haven't told my grandparents, as the consensus seems to be that it's up to my mom. And I get that. For now, as long as she promises to tell them eventually, I'll hold my tongue. Update 2: My mom told my grandparents. They are as confused as we are. They haven't spoken to anyone on that side since about a week before our trip. And it turns out my grandparents were about to send a big cheque. My grandfather has said he won't send the cheque until we get this sorted. My nana is annoyed that they used her son against her for what she perceives as no reason. I think I need to add the context that we live in Canada and they live in the US. And the message came on the day Trump instituted those tariffs. We've always had a difference of politics (they love Trump for some reason) but we almost never talk politics with them. My grandfather thinks they will come around once they realize the money has dried up. Also, they were supposed to send my nana part of my uncle's ashes and they never have. She deserves to have her sons ashes. All of this came out as my nana muttered angrily.",

        "selftext": "My fianc\u00e9e (31F) and I (33M) have a daughter together (2F). My mom passed away in 2020, my dad lives on the other side of the country, and my fianc\u00e9e's parents both passed away in 2014. That leaves the only grandparent figures to my daughter that live nearby as my own grandparents (69F and 72M), who live about 15 minutes away. My grandma (step, but has been a grandma to me my whole life) has an incurable cancer, and my grandpa has dementia that is early on but progressing. Partly for these reasons, we would like our daughter to get as many memories with them as possible while they're still around and before my grandpa's memory loss becomes severe. There was one time we attempted an overnight stay with them while we were home by ourselves. It didn't go so well; she had a hard time going to sleep and was clear she has some separation anxiety. It wasn't all bad, but clearly something that needs to be worked on.  Ever since, my grandma, who between the two of them is usually the one we talk to and who makes decisions, has been quick to point out examples of her showing separation anxiety when around (which has become infrequent, the last time being on Christmas). When asking if they'd be willing to take her for a couple hours to get some time with her, whether just because or we have something to take care of, she refuses, saying she needs to get over separation anxiety before they can take her again. Our thoughts are that she won't get over it if we don't give her a chance to. And we don't exactly have a village of people able to help with that, as partly mentioned before. Meanwhile, my grandparents frequently watch the kids of my cousin (25F), the kids being 6F, 4M, 3M, and 2F. She is no longer with either of the two fathers and has been known to frequently dump her kids on our grandparents. My grandma has said multiple times after various incidents of disrespect that she will not help my cousin anymore, but ultimately winds up doing so anyway. When we bring up these issues, my grandma claims that because these kids are not well taken care of (sadly true), she needs to keep a closer eye on them; we take this as our daughter being punished for being well taken care of. She also believes they do not have separation anxiety because of the rocky relationship with their mom, so they are more willing to be at their house. She takes our pushing that we accuse her of playing favoritism with the other kids.  We realize that someone has to watch those kids so their mom can work. My situation is more fortunate in that regard as I work while my fianc\u00e9e is a stay at home mom. But we think there needs to somehow be more balance in the situation. And again, to have my daughter and grandparents to get plenty of time together before it's too late. So... AITA?",

        "selftext": " My brother (24M) and I (22F) are living at our parents\u2019 house with two siblings until our finances are sorted. Some of us are learning new skills and breaking into careers while we don\u2019t have to worry about bills. I\u2019ve had issues with my older brother (Jamal, placeholder name) before, but lately, he\u2019s been combative. He talks to our two older sisters behind our backs and seems convinced by them our parents are controlling and don\u2019t want us independent. He\u2019s a pain; he doesn\u2019t say anything bad directly, but he goes out of his way to eat healthily and restrict himself in front of me, making me feel bad about my body and weight. He pretends to be supportive, though. He opens canned beans without our mom\u2019s permission, knowing he\u2019s supposed to ask to avoid a mess. His excuse is he bought it with his own money, claiming he doesn\u2019t make messes (he doesn\u2019t, to be fair). Mom gets mad at me whenever he does this, so I have to tell her, which he doesn\u2019t like since it\u2019s \u201cnot my business\u201d and \u201cthis is a problem between me and mom, not you.\u201d He does the same with eggs, setting aside food for himself to \u201csave time\u201d while working on other stuff, which is unfair. Again, he uses the excuse he bought it with his money, but if I have no money, I doubt he does either. He eats more food than us, but I get the impression he thinks he\u2019s better than us because it\u2019s \u201chealthy\u201d or he \u201cworks out,\u201d spending half his day walking around the house or outside. None of this is good for his mental health, and he never listens to us. After I took a shower, I needed to tell our mother something, so I called her and then yelled her name. Jamal came out of his room, ready to leave, and said, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to bother her over the air purifier. I\u2019m coming downstairs; I can turn it off.\u201d I wasn\u2019t asking about that, so I kept calling her and asked him to open her door. He retorted, \u201cWhat are you trying to pry her off her bed for? You don\u2019t need to bother her over every little thing.\u201d I told him I wanted to tell her something. He opened the door, then walked off. I asked if she was on her bed, and he said no. When I told him to walk inside, he said he had to \u201cbe somewhere\u201d (nowhere). I was upset since he knows I\u2019m trying to get her attention, but he does the bare minimum. I laid this out for him and called him weird for that. He cut me off, saying, \u201cDon\u2019t start this with me.\u201d I reiterated everything and insisted he was weird for not helping. He shot back, \u201cYou barely help me. You can\u2019t be bothered to throw a potato in the oven while I\u2019m outside helping our pregnant sister. How about that?\u201d I reiterated every issue of his while he walked off, telling me this was \u201cpetty and unnecessary\u201d before leaving. AITA  Edit: To clarify, I\u2019m describing how his actions make me feel. He has never outright called me fat; I just don\u2019t like watching him eat the way he does since it makes me feel bad.",

        "selftext": "Hello everyone! Just made an account, so bear with me while I try and type this out well! *Fake Names* My best friend Macy (19) and Me ( 22 ) have been best friends for 11 years. We\u2019ve been a very close pair and never had arguments. I watched her grow up while I grew up as well. She\u2019s always been like a sister to me. I\u2019ve been there whenever she needed me as she was also there for me. A few years back she had moved to Maine with her family and it absolutely devastated us. We would hang out on week days and every weekend together and now having that divide was crushing. We still kept in touch and stayed close, communication just got harder as years went on. She has recently graduated, started college and a job. I am so proud of her for all her achievements, she is one of the smartest people I know. A few months ago she got engaged to her 6 year long relationship with her boyfriend Rob ( 20 ). I was ABSOLUTELY ecstatic!!! To see her beaming for joy was a beautiful heartwarming thing. He proposed to her around all their friends when they went on a camping trip. How cute, right? She face-timed me to tell me and show me the ring. I jumped up and down and squealed for her hahaha. A few months after she was talking to me about plans for their wedding. They decided to hold off until they both graduated college to officially get married. I think that's a very wise decision on their part. After telling me this, she proceeded to say- \u201cOh btw. Destiny ( 18 ) is probably going to be my Maid Of Honor. Hope you aren\u2019t upset.\u201d I won\u2019t lie, it was like a slap to the face and it did hurt. Her and Destiny became friends when she moved to Maine. They\u2019ve been friends for around 7 years now. It hurt me only because I feel even though she\u2019s been great friends with her, it would make more sense for me to be that since we\u2019ve had a close friendship of 11 years going on 12 now. I didn\u2019t want her to feel I was trying to be an ass or poison the conversation on something exciting, so I kept quiet for now. I waited a month and I couldn\u2019t shake the hurt I was feeling. Since she moved I felt a bit like I was now the \u201cPast\u201d so to speak. I texted Macy- explaining how I truly felt and how I wasn\u2019t trying to create issues, but just voicing my feelings. She told me she was never trying to hurt me but that Destiny just meant a lot to her\u2026.but don\u2019t I as well? She told me I could still be a bridesmaid but it was just the bluntness and putting a friend she hasn\u2019t known for as long in that position that truly just hurt me and made me feel off.  Am I the asshole for being upset about this? ",

I did not really talk to their group, other than saying hi, and I was speaking to another girl about university and the states.

I understood the banter, but didn't mess with that, so already knew to not engage with them and avoid them. At a certain point I was just sitting with the one girl from the group and myself, as my friend and her's went to get drinks seperately. We started talking about skincare as she saw my lip balm on the table and made a lewd comment about me having it. I told her so you like my friend and she said yeah but was saying what he was wearing wasn't nice. I asked her if she had a boyfriend and she said she was dating a guy, and I asked if her friends had boyfriends and she said yes, and I said oh it's probably best you don't sit with us, but I hope he pleases you (meant it as treats you well, BUT that is a bit weird to say) you and everything goes well. She took offence and said these aren't your seats and said a few rude things I can't remmeber, I said yes but we were here first this is our land, so you can piss off basically taking a dig at what she said before. About 20 minutes later, a member of staff came to me and pulled me aside. They explained I was reported as making an inappropriate comment to a few females and I had to leave. I was taken aback but said yeah of course, because I know better than to argue as it's a strict policy that bars need to enforce. When I was being escorted out I did explain there was a girl I told to girl to kick rocks when I found out she had a boyfriend, although I had been interacting with men/women all night and nobody had complained. I was pretty much sober as I don't like to drink much. The staff that escorted me out apologised and said they felt uncomfortable doing that to me, and I said that they were being professional and it's fine. They said they would love to have me back but as a hard  policy, any complaint is taken seriously. We exchanged names and that was it. I am 99% sure this was why I was kicked out. Whether something was taken out of context is understandable, and to be honest I should have known better to be rude. AITA for telling someone to piss off and getting kicked out, of was this blown out of proportion?",

The thing is, when everyone is gone and I'm alone in the apartment, I tend to lock the bedroom door bc it makes me feel safer.  Today my roommate was suppose to come back. Well, during the time they were coming back to the apartment, I took a nap after studying for 6 hours straight so i was lowkey drained and completely forgot about the lock door. I'm a pretty heavy sleeper and therefore i did not notice them knocking on the door. They called me once and texted me once but i slept through that. Around 2 hours later, i finally awoken and saw their text. I immediately got up to unlock it and by that time they were hella fricking pissed. I see that I do sound like ah but its not like they were locked out of the apt. idk maybe im overthinking it and i am an ahole. ",

        "selftext": "Pre-COVID, I (31F) was a bridesmaid for my cousin, Diva (34F). Everything was going smoothly until a few weeks before the wedding. Being artistically inclined, I offered to design her wedding invitations as a gift but made it clear I couldn't produce them myself due to financial constraints, as I was handling my mother's medical bills and our family dog's medication for his heart condition. To provide context, I'm an only child caring for a senior citizen (my mother, who is over 70 years old and a cancer patient) and our senior dog. As the wedding planning progressed, Diva approved my designs with some revisions, and I happily submitted them. However, when the actual invitations arrived, they weren't my designs. This was heartbreaking because if I had been informed that my design wouldn't be used, I would have been fine with it, but no one told me. I let it go and moved on. Regarding the pre-wedding parties, I couldn't attend due to my mother's and our dog's medical conditions, which Diva knew about for months and years prior. Despite this, Diva was upset. I couldn't leave my mother, as there was no one else to care for her, nor could she handle our dog, who needed medication and could be aggressive. Hiring help was also not an option due to financial constraints. The Maid of Honor (MOH) got involved, and I kept asking for consideration due to my family responsibilities. The whole family knew about my mother's condition, and some knew about our dog's condition, but I was told I wasn't fulfilling my bridesmaid duties. I had already designed the invitations and helped with bridesmaid dress choices, but I couldn't attend the pre-wedding parties. This led to a feud among the cousins and eventually reached our parents. Days before the wedding, I was still trying to be a good bridesmaid. Hair and makeup were scheduled for 3 AM, but with my responsibilities, I couldn't leave home at 2 AM. I offered to do my own hair and makeup and even negotiated to arrive before the wedding started, prioritizing the ceremony. However, they wouldn't compromise, so my mother and I decided not to attend to avoid further drama. In hindsight, it was a blessing in disguise because our dog passed away on the wedding day, and we were there for him when he passed.",

        "selftext": "I was recently out late night to party with my friends. We found this fancy pub which attracts a lot of tourists - I\u2019m not one as I\u2019ve been in this country for more than a year now. I\u2019m an expat, Asian (brown). We decided to enter the pub. The bouncer was standing right in front of the entrance. I saw him and made a small head nod with a smile proceeding to walk past (which I do usually with no issues at all, kinda always felt like a bar/pub code) while he was parallely saying something to me in the local language which I don\u2019t speak. Note - he didn\u2019t block the way by any means or hand gestures or there was no queue. In a second, I was aggressively pulled from behind, he snatched my backup and shouted with anger along the lines of \u201cYOU DON\u2019T WALK BY WHEN I\u2019M TALKING, YOU DISRESPECTED ME, THIS IS MY PLACE AND YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED\u201d. I was shook by this manhandling incident and apologised to him that I didn\u2019t understand the language and not meant to disrespect him by any means. He furiously said, it doesn\u2019t matter and I\u2019m denied access. I apologised and returned. Firstly, it\u2019s not a local pub, the name is evidently common across many countries and it attracts tourists - why communicate in a local language? Second, even if that was a miss from my side to not attempt to understand what he was saying or informing him I don\u2019t speak the language, was his behaviour justified or AITA? Note - I was not super drunk or unstable or alarming by any chance, also had a decent outfit for a pub and was let in with a smile by the other bouncer in a different pub. Edit - I went through the reviews of this pub in internet and the bouncers are known for their notorious racial discriminations so it\u2019s not a me issue. But nevertheless I will not play the racist card here, because I did misunderstand his communication as an invitation/greeting due to my lack of attention/language barrier. I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019d have got a different treatment if was not brown after reading the reviews.",

We didn't have family to bail us out, so I was desperate. had already talked with my bf about if I should but I made it seem like a joke.

He believed it and was really happy but last night he went through my phone and found out. We've been arguing about it all day and I feel terrible. He got really mad and said I betrayed his trust. He said I should've talked to him instead of doing it behind his back but if I talked to him he wouldve never let me. I get why he's upset, but I feel like I didn't have a choice. I don't make a crazy amount of money but it's just enough so we van afford our expenses.

One of my housemates really likes ambient lighting and I've had to ask her to take a motion sensor light down in the hall and on another occassion she took another light down after I suggested a compromise. So now in our living room she's put 3 lamps which are just exposed, high strengh lightbulbs (with no shades). To be fair I almost never use the living room, in part because of anxiety but also in part because our other housemate (who is now moving out) has anger management issues so it wasn't a great vibe. But I was hoping to actually socialise with the new housemate who I have mutual friends with. I also had to take my migraine meds when she left the door to the living room open with one of the lights on but tbf she's now moved it out of view from thedoor. WIBTA if I asked her to get rid of the lamps from the living room/move them to her room? I think I might be TA because I've already asked her to remove lights from common areas, she's spent money on them and has them in a room that I barely ever use. Edit: So for info I'm not against any light, in the previous situation I just asked to have the overhead light on instead as I can just wear a cap.

Sharon and her husband(Vlad) rented out almost the whole resort and paid for a villa for me and my parents to stay in. This villa had a pool (all to ourselves!!) and two separate mini buildings, one for living and one for lounging. This wedding was VERY extravagant with a lot of Vlad's business partners. Their business social life is the type where you are drunk all day making fun of people; each business associate was pretty fat with a wife who had crazy Botox and plastic surgery. After the beach ceremony, we were escorted to a dining/dance space where lots of speeches were given. One of the speeches was given by a business associate's wife(who fits the beauty standard explained above). Her speech was pretty unremarkable, and I wasn't paying much attention until she mentioned Sharon's Son's help with her business called Blackwater. I'm not sure if she made the connection to the infamous mercenary firm, but it made me *almost* laugh, I held it in UNTIL she proceeded to explain what her company was about: water with minerals in it, making it black. Basically, it was dirt water that cracked me up like crazy, and I couldn't hold it in. The room was completely silent before this, and everyone's heads whipped towards me. The speech went on, but it was very awkward. After we finished dinner I was pulled over by Sharon who scolded me for laughing and said that everyone was asking her who I was and why I laughed. Apparently the girl felt very embarrassed and self-conscious after I cracked up. People have been treating me like a pariah ever since. 1.

When I was given the opportunity to live rent-free in a family-owned apartment (as long as I found a roommate to pay a small rent), I chose Ava over a few other options because we were closest at the time. At first, things were fine, but now I feel suffocated. She constantly interrupts my study time, pushing me to play video games or chat despite my boundaries. I\u2019m an extrovert, but after long days at school, I crave alone time. When I retreat to my room, she knocks, saying she feels lonely and wants to sit on my floor, staring at me or talking about her day. I don\u2019t have the backbone to say no, and she pushes back when I try.  Enter my other best friend, Erica (18F), who I\u2019ve known since we were 10. She\u2019s introverted, incredibly kind, and planning for med school, meaning she\u2019s highly study-oriented. She currently lives in expensive student housing but plans to move home next year, which would mean a brutal 1-2 hour commute. If I had chosen her as my roommate originally, she would have benefited from the affordable rent.  Recently, Ava\u2019s parents offered her a free apartment near campus. I was thrilled for her and saw it as the perfect opportunity\u2014she could save money, and Erica could move in, improving her living situation. I told Erica it was a possibility, and she was excited. However, Ava just told me she\u2019s staying because she\u2019s comfortable here and doesn\u2019t want a new roommate. When she told me, I couldn\u2019t hide my disappointment. Now Ava keeps saying it\u2019s my fault for getting Erica\u2019s hopes up and insists I just want to replace her. But I truly think this move would be better for everyone\u2014Ava could grow more independent, save money, and Erica wouldn\u2019t have to commute for hours.

So for some backstory my girlfriend has a friend (Sarah) who had a roommate (Cate) living with her and she had a cat there that she left. Eventually Cate moved and abandoned the cat basically leaving Sarah to take care of the cat for months by herself. I heard many bad things about Cate and her cat but that's just what I heard anyway; I'm at a party with my girlfriend and she's with the lady's in a room when she come into a different room with me and the guys saying that Cate said the cat was pregnant then threw that cat and said she didnt want her anymore! I wasn't there but I believe her when it comes to stuff like that she had a cat for 14 years and she's very passionate about animals. The next day Sarah calls my girlfriend and says the cats throwing up and unfortunately had worms and wasn't pregnant. So Me and her take the cat to a shelter because we can't afford to do the surgery and all that but wanted what's best. Now I'm adopting the cat but Cate is now looking for it claiming she wanted the cat. Am I in the wrong for kidnapping this cat? Sorry for the long post and it may not be the best it's my first.

We didn't just straight up steal it but in this context yes it's stolen  Edited namesAlso names changed obviously for privacy reasonsTldr Friends roommate abused cat (allegedly) and we took her so the cat stays safe.

The problem starts in the pandemic when we both started to have serious issues with self-destructive behaviour.Since last year I have been improving greatly and I think I\u2019m finally healing, but my friend doesn\u2019t seem to want to get on the same path as me. I respect her choices but I really want to help her and it breaks my heart to see her like this, knowing that having her around always slows down my healing journey.Last month, she went on vacation and told me she ordered a package online and sent it to my house (without asking me) and I said it was fine. When it arrived, I stored it in a box under my bed. Some weeks pass, she comes back from her trip and messages me to hang out. She specifically asked me to bring the package, and I thought it was weird but didn\u2019t think too much of it. As I was packing some stuff to bring to her house, I opened the box under my bed and noticed the package wasn\u2019t there. My parents called me downstairs to talk and my dad told me he knew what was inside the package. It was something that could really harm her, and I had no idea. I explained the situation to my parents and thankfully they believed I had no idea about what was inside and I thought I was doing my friend a favour. I started to really think about it and I got really sad at the thought of having helped her smuggle the package behind her parents\u2019 backs. I asked my dad for the package and threw it in the trash before going to my friend\u2019s house. When I arrived, she asked me for the package and I told her what happened. She seemed angry at me and was really quiet through our hangout. I asked my mom to pick me up early, and when I got to my house today, she bombarded my phone with messages saying her package had costed her a lot money and demanded I pay her what she spent or buy her the exact same thing she had bought. I\u2019m not really in a good financial position because I\u2019m saving up for my own education\u2014her family is much richer than mine and her allowance is about three times more than mine\u2014and I didn\u2019t want to spend money only to buy her something dangerous behind her and my parents\u2019 backs. I refused to pay, but that only upset her more. Am I the asshole? ",

We both recently found our niche and audience and have been growing in views in views and followers. What kicked this off was Jacob using a trending audio that sky rocketed his views. I made similar videos (never with the same audio) about the same topic because he and I were really well versed in it. Since his initial video blew up he made numerous other videos with that same audio. All of which preformed well. We both supported each other tremendously and always helped each other with videos whenever we could. Our videos went from 200-500 views to 10s of 100s of thousands. This was big for us as we had been trying to reach an audience for a couple years. But It all changed overnight. One day whole brain storming video ideas, I became inspired but my friends video and decided to make a video using the audio and format from his initial post that blew up. I was excited to tell him about it and show it to him before posting. That night while we were gaming I told him about my idea. His mood instantly changed and I could tell he was bothered. He flat out told me that I was stealing his thing. He asked me if I told you not to post that you wouldn't post it right? To which I replied no. As much as I love Jacob I was never gonna let him dictate what I do and don't post on social media. As in the past he has tried to be rather controlling of myself and other friends. He tried telling me that audio is my thing in this community and you're basically stealing my ir I told him that's how trends and social media works. One person makes something and everyone else copies. He kept calling it my audio when he wasn't even the one who created it. He followed a similar format to everyone else who used it, just specific to our niche. There was a lot of back and forth of him telling me not to but me standing my ground. I went as far as saying \u201cnothing bad can happen to you if I post this\u201d to which he said \u201cyou don\u2019t know that\u201d He wouldn't budge and said straight up I don't want you posting that. It's my thing. I told him I'm sorry but no, you're not gonna dictate this. At the end of the day I didn't end up posting the video, mainly because I was never going to prioritize social media over our friendship. He got off the game when the conversation ended. We still send each other posts every now and again but we haven't had a conversation since then. So am I the asshole for not taking down my post because my friend told me to.",

        "selftext": "My nephew (18M) is a a senior in high school. An important context to know is that he is bisexual, as this plays a role in the story. He is best friends with a freshman which I will call Jake (15M). Jake and my nephew have been best friends since the beginning of the school year. They hang out frequently and tend to call everyday to play games. My nephew is bisexual and he rarely discloses this information except people he trusts, like Jake. I was informed by my nephew that Jake's friend, Danny, has spread fear and disturbing rumors about their friendship. My nephew told me that Danny and Jake are in a turbulent spot with their friendship, therefore things have been heated between the two. So Danny has taken note that my nephew and Jake are close buddies, and has projected his anger on my nephew to spread libel about him.  Danny, Danny's mom, and Jake's mom are all linked together like espionage. While Danny and Jake were fighting, he secretly hijacked information between Danny and my nephew's friendship. Please note that Jake and my nephew are not romantically involved. So Danny's mom saw my nephew and Jake riding on an electric scooter together, which she has blown out of proportion in the context that my nephew and Jake are in a relationship. Then, my nephew told me that Danny came to the conclusion he is gay because of a joke Jake made while they all had lunch together. Danny has communicated with his mother in malice of my nephew, and spreads fear about my nephew's sexuality to Jake's mom. Jake's mom and Danny's mom are best friends, and have been in communication about this. Now, Jake's mom is accusing my nephew of grooming and influencing Jake to identifyas LGBT. My nephew has NOT DONE THAT. Now, my nephew and Jake have a strained relationship because his parents banned Jake from speaking to my nephew due to these horrific rumors. Even though my nephew is an adult, I feel like I need to take this to the school. I want to confront the parents for overdramatizing and hijacking information about my nephew's sexuality. With the fact he is 18, I fear they could exacerbate it considering the political climate in the US. WIBTA?",

We had a teenage romance in early high school that eventually became an on-again-off-again thing in our twenties before finally completely dissolving at around my thirtieth birthday.  We did briefly get married shortly after college graduation so that she could get on my health insurance, but we were living separately at the time and even dating other people.  Because we've known each other for so long, we'll still get coffee or talk over Zoom 4-5x a year to catch up, but the romantic part of our relationship has been completely buried for close to over a decade. And when I say buried, I mean completely gone. Not even a little spark. We've lived across the country from eachother for about five years now. The meetups are mostly talking about life and work shit and the occasional reminiscing. I'm reluctant to give them up because, gloomily enough, Mandy and I are the only two people from our original friend group that are either still living or talking to eachother. I've been with my current wife (38F, Sam) for around six years. She knows about my conversations with Mandy, and she's given her approval, but I can tell the approval has been given reluctantly.  I love my wife to death and I don't want to make her feel uncomfortable, but I also don't want to lose this connection to my past. WIBTA for continuing this platonic relationship with my ex?",

If you don\u2019t, here\u2019s a quick rundown, basically Doug Ford is sending $200 to every citizen of Ontario, by mail, as a way to convince them to vote for him.  Today, my older sibling (23 NB) got their bribery cheque in the mail, my parents still haven\u2019t gotten theirs and so it became a topic of discussion between my dad and I.  My dad mentioned that in his and my mom\u2019s bribery cheques is also money for me (nearly 16 F) and so naturally I asked to have access to this money, and my dad said no. I then messaged my mom as she\u2019s usually the more reasonable of the two, and she said that because I don\u2019t pay taxes it\u2019s not actually my money.  My birthday is in less than a month and because it\u2019s my sweet 16 I\u2019m planning to go all out, my mum knows this and I said that this money would make everything so much easier for me as I\u2019m paying for my entire party out of pocket, she said \u201cexactly because we pay for everything it\u2019s our money.\u201d  Imo, the least they could do is keep the money for when I\u2019m 18 and actually do pay taxes.

This friend I\u2019ve known since last year but we started to be closer friends this year being my senior year, but for some reason I don\u2019t know how I never noticed but this friend smells absolutely terrible. I try to warn him about this because I don\u2019t want him to get made fun of by other people but he doesn\u2019t believe me because the only people he hangs out with are \u201cweird\u201d kids who I am kind of forced to be friends with because I\u2019m friends with him. And those kids do NOT fucking shower and don\u2019t care about hygiene enough to tell him. I try to assure him I\u2019m not lying and tell him in private so I don\u2019t embarrass him but it just never changes, he lies and says he cleans his clothes everyday but he wears the exact same thing every day. He isn\u2019t financially unstable or poor either, he is able to afford a lot of things I\u2019ve seen in the past. He just genuinely doesn\u2019t believe he smells bad. I feel as though being around him kind of harms my reputation because people will assume it\u2019s me who smells but it\u2019s really him, and I feel like such a dick sometimes for trying to be blunt and honest with him but it is to complete deaf ears. What\u2019s worse is that every morning I sit in this specific spot where I enjoy my personal time before class, but this year he found my spot and there followed all the other kids who also act odd. I started distancing myself from him and sitting in different places trying to avoid him because I genuinely cannot bear the way he smells and the people he brings along. And I\u2019m not just hating on the people he brings because they\u2019re \u201cweird\u201d, they are actually horrible people who constantly talk crazy amounts of shit about me and contribute to rumors spread on me, and whenever I tell them it bothers me they look at me as if I\u2019m fucking weirdo. Also I was planing on asking out a girl who sits near the place where me and him sit, and for some fucking reason whenever I tell him about this he snaps back and looks dead at her and says \u201cWHO HER?\u201d, this was my final straw that made me decide I am done spending time with this guy. I currently sit in a different spot in the morning and I try to tell him it\u2019s for a different reason but he genuinely will not stop talking to me at every opportunity and I just told him one day \u201cBro you smell like fucking shit please stop talking\u201d and he looked at me crazy.

        "selftext": "Okay so some background, I am a female high school student and I am dating a boy in high school as well. However, we go to different schools. This Saturday he has his snowball dance and 3 weeks ago we talked about it and mutually decided we\u2019d go to my schools because he didn\u2019t wanna go to his and he thought mine would be more fun so I agreed. I wanted to go to both but didn\u2019t push because I didn\u2019t want to make him do smth he didn\u2019t want to. I figured it wouldn\u2019t be an issue. A few days ago he asked what day my dance was on and I told him \u201cit\u2019s in two weeks\u201d and he said \u201coh okay cool because my friends just invited me to go to my schools dance and stay the night at his house.\u201d And I got a little hurt and said \u201cwhy are you going? I thought you didn\u2019t want to because it was lame\u2026?\u201d And he said \u201cwell I just got invited and I think I\u2019d be fun with my friends.\u201d and we js left it at that. Today, the topic was brought up again and I told him I was uncomfortable with the idea because there are quite a few girls at his school that I\u2019m very suspicious of, there is a girl he\u2019s friends with who is going, and it was weird to go to a school dance with your friends when you have a gf. He told me I was being paranoid and he wasn\u2019t gonna cheat and he js wanted to have fun with friends. I told him I was fine with him hanging out with his friends but maybe in a setting I was more comfortable with. He said I was being dramatic and it was js an innocent hang out, I told him it was weird to go with your friends and he said \u201ceveryone went with each other last time\u201d and I told him \u201cyeah that\u2019s bc they don\u2019t have gfs\u201d and he got all annoyed. I\u2019ve talked with 4 of my good girl friends, 1 male friend, my brother, my parents, and a family friend and all of them think it\u2019s a little odd. I tried explaining my whole side of things and how I would prefer if he skipped so I\u2019d be more comfortable and he just told me girls don\u2019t like him, he\u2019s not interested, and I\u2019m being annoying and pissing him off because he just wants to hang out with his friends. I know this is very stupid and trivial, but these are my issues and I\u2019m only in high school once. Let me have little problems now. Am I the asshole for arguing with my bf over this? Edit: On Wednesday he said he would go to my basketball game and then backed out last minute (like an hour before) and told me he\u2019d hang out with me Friday and Sunday to make up for it. I got a text yesterday (Thursday) where he told me he was also spending the night with his friends on Friday night. I got upset and told him that was going to mess up our plans and he got mad at me and said he never does anything with them and he wants to see them. He has a sleep over with them every 2 weeks and when I want to do things with friends I never can because I\u2019m cancelling stuff to be with him. I\u2019ve had people over in October and that was the last time that happened. He ended up breaking up with me because I\u2019m too controlling, according to him. Everyone I\u2019ve talked to thinks that yes I should\u2019ve handled it better and shouldn\u2019t have gotten as upset as I did, but I also explained to him that I wasn\u2019t telling him he couldn\u2019t see his friends but that I was upset that he planned over our previously made plans. He disregarded what I said and how I was feeling. Everyone he talked to about it told him it was extremely impulsive and that he should\u2019ve thought about it more. I skipped school today because I am absolutely devastated. His friends are all trying to talk sense into him and say he\u2019s crazy\u2026 I don\u2019t know what to do now\u2026",

        "selftext": "For a little context I met my BF in high school. We dated off and on early in our friendship but over the past 12 years aside from a short Covid fling we\u2019ve been solid long distance buddies. There was a discussion about moving in with BF in their town to restart my life. BF always thought I should get out of my old city. I said no that I couldn\u2019t live in a small town. Last year BF brought it up and told me that was an ask to try to get back together. This has been in the back of mind, but I never acted on it. Well over the past month BF returned into my life full time for a bit. First was visiting parents and secondly we planned a cruise in my friend group. I started catching feelings during the time we hung out. It fully set in over the cruise. Not sure exactly what I was feeling at that time, but I figured I had time to sort myself out. Turns out one of the people(NG) we met on the cruise made a huge impact.  What was supposed a short stay at the beach post cruise with three friends left over turned into a scene out of a romance movie that would have the whole dinner table turning heads to listen. My other friend and I became background characters to GF and BFs vacation. It had classics like a spontaneous a road trip and sleeping on the beach. I did not handle it well. The first few days BF noticed and pointed it out. I confessed after some prodding and BF was very nice about it. GF listened to me babble and made sure I was ok. That bit of honesty, however, unleashed a torrent of emotion I didn\u2019t know I had. I became a vacuum of negativity. It got worse as I literally had front seats to their growing flirting, whispers and lack of presence to others in the group.  The lowest was when BFs new partner tried to warm up to me and give me \u201cwe can talk about anything that\u2019s bothering you\u201d line. Having the person who swept your crush off their feet try to console you is a torture fit for one of the nine hells. The last night before we all flew back my BF decided to ditch the group for hankey pankey while we were on the understanding that we would hang out before going our separate ways. Radio silence till 7am next day. When they got back I lost it and said things about BF being selfish and making the whole trip about themselves, rubbing their relationship in everyone else\u2019s face until they couldn\u2019t be bothered to have is around. Couldn\u2019t show some restraint for a few days? There was a \u201csorry you felt that way\u201d apology. I shut down and left for the airport by myself in the morning as BF and NG shared a shower in our hotel. I got a tearful phone messages saying that BG doesn\u2019t want to lose me and that I can take my time to pieces things, but no apology. I\u2019ve blocked her, for my own sanity but I felt disrespected. I probably should have said something earlier. Maybe never say anything at all and pack it down. Crush or not I find it hard to see me as the asshole here for expecting some restraint. I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m the asshole, but how big am I?",

        "selftext": "Before diving into the problem that happened last week, I need to do some background from previous years. I'm 25 (M) have been playing RPGs with my friends for a long time (about 10 years together), we've tried many systems, books and even made our own RPG (it didn't work out as intended). Around 2020, the pandemic hit my country and my schedule changed, because of that, I had to quit some RPG sessions and deny new ones until I figured out my new schedule. At the time denied an RPG that I really wanted, however, I couldn't commit to participating; the planning started in mid-2020, but it didn't work out so the idea was scraped out. After that, in 2022, the pandemic was much more manageable, and everything was getting back to normal, the RPG plan that I wanted to play with my friends was coming back, but they didn't invite me. The Dungeon Master (DM for short) already had a full team (6 people), and was unable to add one more.At the time, I was the jerk because I started harassing the DM to put me in the game, and this started a big fight (if necessary, I will can be specific in an edit), but long story short, all RPG games with my friends were stopped for 6 months because I created a rift between friends, some understood the context of 2020 and they were on my side, others defended the DM because I denied my seat at the time. In the end, the DM and I apologized for eachother and the RPG did not happen. Now, for the problem that is happening: Another RPG started brewing with another DM (I will call her Anna) started planning a Oneshot, she is already a DM in another RPG session (D&D) that I also play, however, she wanted to also DM Exalted (a really complex system). Anna invited me and 4 other friends to play, at the time I said yes. So the next day I started reading the system and was really intimidated,it has 200+ charms, and alot of specifc rules, so I asked one of the players for help, but it didn't help much. Intimidated and confused, I later told Anna that I was vacating my seat; she was upset but didn't argue, later another friend took my seat. My reasoning to gave up my seat was that I wouldn't commit to a really complex system to play only 1-3 sessions, only if it was a campaign I would comit. A few days passed, and I heard from my friends that Anna was thinking about changing the Exated one-shot to a campaign, and she would stop her D&D campaign for it. I didn't tell my friends at the time, but I was really upset, not only would the one-shot become a campaign, but the other campaigns would stop because of it. So, IATA for asking for my playce back in the campaing with the fear of bringing back that rift and maybe losing some friends?",

Well, one day in practice (in the middle of July) after warm-ups, I had given a suggestion to our Coach about how the defense needs to work on their hand movement and the way they should go when the ball is snapped. BTW, our defense sucked this summer.....i was on defense\ud83d\ude11. And, he looked at me, like he's my dad when I did something stupid, and I said, What? He said.Well, can't it wait?! Half of the people were on my side, and half were on the coach's. I still continued, and all I said that made him really mad was, Maybe if you weren't so soft on us, then Defense would've sucked right now. And I wanna add one more person, he's another coach, he had served time in the military, and as soon as he heard me what I said , he said All, right. Since yall were soft, LEMME MAN YOU THE F*CK UP! And made all of us run nonstop until practice is over. If we slow down, it is more minutes, walking and talking, more minutes. Luckily, we finished before I had a heart attack, and everyone knew not to give coach obvious facts to anger or punish us like that ever again. AITA? Edit 2/5/25: Okay, yes, ITA, but if yall wanna know if my team hated me or not, no, they didn't hate me, they didn't clown on my ass, we just simply laughed it off and that was that.",

        "selftext": "I'll try to be as fair as I possibly can to my friend about this. She's mad at me because I basically forced her to admit that she needs to be alone. I'm entirely *okay* with her needing to be alone but she refused to actually admit that or communicate with me until I basically said, either tell me what's fucking going on or take the space you so clearly need already. This started basically two weeks ago. My friend shut down without telling me what was going on. I still don't know the entire story of why she did tbh. Then, about a week ago she said she was ready to talk again and explained a little about how why she shut down but not the whole reason. She said she was ready to talk again but she *very* clearly wasn't. I kept telling her that if she needed more space I genuinely did not care and would give her that, she didn't say she did.  Then these past few days she started replying to the first few messages I'd send then ignoring me entirely the rest of the day. Again I said if she needed space to tell me that. She didn't. This morning she said she's trying to distance herself from everyone and that she's used to being alone almost all the time. Finally it came to a head just a few minutes ago and I called her out. I basically laid it out for her, I said either tell me what's going on and let's settle this or take your space already but stop pretending like there's nothing wrong.  Keep in mind. This is a friend I'd been talking to pretty much 24/7 for the past two to three months. We'd gotten really, REALLY close, she told me things very few people in her life know. I think I have a right to say something, to be worried when she basically disappears on me, comes back, but then *everything* is different than it was before and she essentially says she has no plans of things going back to how they were beforehand. AITA here?  Edit: I sent her this message because I realized pretty quickly that yeah I'm the asshole here, I promise I'm not going to send anything after this but I need to apologize. I've been spamming you with messages, not respecting your boundaries, and, simply put not ACTUALLY listening to what you've been telling me this whole time even if you didn't directly say it. I don't know that I can claim to actually care about you after doing all that. I'll leave you alone now for a while. I hope we can reconnect and fix things eventually but if not I understand ",

        "selftext": "Once I asked a friend to help me move and they said yes because they are compassionate and helpful. I told them I'd buy a pizza. I had already hired 2 guys and a truck to do the heavy lifting, just needed some extra hands. Then one of the guys quit while we were still packing up boxes with stuff. So i asked my friend if they could fill in and they said yes because they saw I was in need and they are compassionate and helpful. I offered to buy my friend some additional pizza.  After a few hours of heavy lifting (I assume, I had to pop out for a bit for band rehearsal) my friend asked if I could pay them what I was going to give to the guy who quit.  Unfortunately, I already gave that guy money, so I could only pay my friend about half that. Then the other guy with the truck quit and I told my friend just to cover for them until I found a new guy.  I told my friend I couldn't give them any additional money for helping, but I would pay them $1 for each box. They said ok because it wasn't really about the money, it was about helping.After we got the truck loaded, I paid them $1 for every box... after the first 100 boxes. I forgot to tell them that part. The lock on the truck was broken and I didn't want to pay to fix it, so I told my friend to sleep in the truck to keep it safe while we parked it on the Chicago streets until we could unload it in a couple days. They said ok, because they knew no one else would do it and they wanted to keep the boxes safe. When it was time to unload the truck, I had to let her get a head start without me (I had band practice again). They were responsible for bringing boxes up the stairs while I was responsible for telling them which room to put them in (though admittedly I did get distracted a few times, phones right?). Once we got it all unloaded, my friend was helping me unpack because they saw I needed the extra hands. I opened the box marked kitchen and discovered that one of my mugs wasn't in the kitchen box.  I asked my friend where the mug was. They said they weren't sure, maybe it was just forgotten in all the confusion and they could go back to the house to check or look in another box.  I fired them immediately and began telling their friends and coworkers, I don't know for sure that they didn't steal the mug.  So, am I the a-hole? Which is more likely- that my friend did all that work and still stole a mug? or that I gave them an impossible task without supporting her and one item in a sea of items was temporarily misplaced?",

We have been good friends but our communication is pretty ass on both of our parts.  Now we made plans to hang out at new years at his place, which for me is a good two hour trip and not that I mind the distance but I couldn\u2019t sleep over there cause his roommate would have friends over and they wouldn\u2019t have any space for me. And we couldnt spend it at mine since i would still be moving in and have nothing but a single person mattress and a lot of bags and boxes to get around. We planned this like a week ahead and I did say I might have to cancel later on while planning cause of my dad being in the hospital with a broken thumb and a harsh infection on the stitches. I also told him about my worry for the distance I\u2019d have to travel that late at night, but said I\u2019d let him know about it. Which I did four days prior that I wouldn\u2019t be able to make it due to the reasons I gave him before. I told him I was sorry and that I\u2019d make up for it soon. But all he did was sigh loudly and said \u201cokay, yeah sure.\u201d And before I could say anything else he hung up. He ghosted me for like a week and didnt even show up to the place where our friends meet up for a week and a half. Then he showed up like nothing happened until he asked to talk to me alone and continued to talk about how it was a asshole move to cancel on him like that and acted like I betrayed him last second.  Now I apologized again in that moment and then he said it\u2019s fine and that we could go back to being friends like we stopped because I cancelled.  So a few weeks ago, he invited me to go to this vintage market after college. To which I kind of said the same thing about having to see cause I was a little busy and starting a new therapy trial and could be tired at that time. That day came and I went home early after puking on an empty stomach and he called me the moment I was gonna text him and I told him first thing and he didn\u2019t even say anything before hanging up and ghosting me again and he hasn\u2019t texted me since. I haven\u2019t been at college since then and I follow my classes online cause I\u2019m still incredibly sick and I haven\u2019t been able to leave my house or move too much at all.  I\u2019ve been feeling guilty about it the entire time and I\u2019ve tried to apologize a lot of times through text but he just keeps ignoring me. I feel really shitty about cancelling him a bunch of times and I really don\u2019t know if it\u2019s my fault or not?  So AITA?",

Had she looked ugly I would\u2019ve deleted it no questions asked, but it was a cute picture with other friends that I don\u2019t even see that much. It was a fun memory.

She then threatened to share ugly photos of me (that I honestly don\u2019t care about) and report the story. I said go ahead. Anyway, after a long fight, I gave in. I know that her high school friends were obsessed with being skinny and laughed at fat girls (what the fuck), so I know it\u2019s a sensitive issue for her (even though she doesn\u2019t realize it).

In this group there are 2 people which I will call Laura (F) & Paul (M). They are both in their early thirties. I have been very close to them. My relationship with Laura is based on a lot of compassion, laughter & we are basically telling each other almost everything, she helped a lot at the beginning when I started and she believes in me.  With Paul the relationship I would say have been a bit toxic but good, as I was always afraid of how he would react, he would give me a lot of advices based solely on his pov. He never really tried to understand me as a whole (I struggle with mental health), a lot of tough love I would say.  Early December we have decided to buy a common gift for a birthday. Laura has bought a gift. Everyone gave the money, except for Paul . When she confronted him, he stated that he's been really struggling financially & big family issues. She tried to understand but for her it was not a valid reason and he should have tried to communicate instead of ignoring her. Paul owes me a significant amount of money too. Paul has been ignoring my texts for 2 weeks and being very avoidant at work. He finally replied and I was shocked. He stated that I should have said something to her and basically I am bad friend for not taking his side and he was more there for me than her (which is not true) & he's taking his distances from everyone as our establishment will close in 2 months.  I told him I didn't want to be in the middle of this (I have a past with this), you are both my friends and I simply can not choose. He is forgetting that I have helped him in the past, I was there for him. He didn't understand he chooses to stop talking & unfollowed me on social media. I don't think I will see my money ever again.  Laura has been very supportive, understood I will not take sides and our relationship has not changed.  I have lost a friend, but AITA for not taking the side & being more supportive ? Thank you for reading.  Edit: names for clarity",

So, I've been feeling down for a while and have not been able to pull my weight in our household.. so last night I pulled myself together and did my best to clean the floors downstairs since she was complaining she wouldn't get it done...I know this was due to my lack of action, I'm probably the jerk there, which is why I wanted to give her a worryfree weekend and do the floors for her.. I could only do the floors tho, no dusting or whatever... it's not even dusty since I did it last week..I even told her I would do them next week (I leave tomorrow for the weekend) My mom came back from school an immediately began pointing out what hadn't been done and said nothing about what I did do until I pointed  it out. This isn't the issue,the issue is that I woke up to use the bathroom and have to walk by her room, apparently she was awake and called me over. She started by saying how it bothered her that I cleaned the floors and it kept her up all night. I know how she is and this is usually how fights start, so it being 6am I was quite agitated as I was not in the mood for this so early in the morning. Anyway, she told me she does not appreciate what I've done, that this was not what we agreed upon, why didn't I do the surfaces like I was told, why did I clean the floors, now she's stuck spending the weekend dusting and so on and so forth. At this point I exploded because for the 100th time, it's obvious she doesn't listen to the words coming out of my mouth. I told her I was not doing this at 6 am, that I wanted to go back to bed before my alarm went off. Her answer? Then my day is ruined and I'll have to cancel everything because I can't sleep like this..  At this point I exploded and I might've evolved into the jerk.. I called (screamed) her manipulative and that I am not doing this so early in the morning. That I was digusted that she would be acting like this over me trying to do something nice for her. She told me I didn't do it for her, I did it for myself to manipulate HER and what was she supposed to do this weekend? Guys, I was honestly flabbergasted.... I was like anything you want?!  Apparently, she can't do anything she wants now because I manipulated her by doing what I want and now she has to dust and clean the surfaces... I.TOLD.HER.TWICE.AT.THIS.POINT. that I would do them.  The conversation was going nowhere and I didn't want the cops called on us for our screaming match this early in the morning, so I cut the conversation short and removed myself from the situation, which..made her even more mad but at this point I didn't even care, I was hurt and angry. Back to my room I went. I just.. I'm at a loss..am I really such a manipulative monster for what I did? Am I in the wrong? Was my thinking off? Should I have just done the stupid dusting? It may sound stupid, I know it does... So here I am..",

So about a day ago R had told us in the gc that S was going out with a guy that was interested in her. This guy Z(20M) had liked S for a long time, but I still felt weird about him. There was a rumor not too long ago that really made everyone in the gc dislike him but we found out that of course the rumors were fake. Still I felt weird about him. S had been talking to Z for a long time and says that his a genuine, nice, kind guy. Z had been asking S out to get to know her better and to finally talk to her in person but S would refuse but then finally she gave in. He even stated that if she felt uncomfortable seeing him by herself that she could come someone, which is what S did. They're probably on the that date right now as I am writing this. So when R told us in the gc that S was going out with Z of course people in the gc didn't see an issue since S had clarified time and time again that Z was not a bad person. Still as I said I still felt weird about him. I have a lot of trust issues with men since I've seen a lot of trashy men with the women around me. So I voiced my concern, I didn't know that this would turn into a whole agreement in the gc about marriage.  L and R were the one's that were going at it, I'd chip in here and there giving my two cents on the agreement but the argument ended, or so I thought. This morning the argument resurfaced again since L had told said, (my name) is hater of men so S don't listen to her My friends already know how I feel about men and this is a joke in the gc so I didn't take it the wrong way. We started joking once again me, R and L in the GC I had said, before you girls go looking for a husband or man with nothing to your name go look for money first I really just said this as a joke not think someone would get offensed to this. I left the gc after saying this since I have things to do around the house after a few hours I come back to the GC to see an argument between R and L. R was saying that before you get married it's better to be financially stable, L was saying that you just need to find a good man and saying that getting married doesn't mean one needs to stop improving themselves. After a while they found out that they were arguing about the same thing but just from different perspectives.  R asked L why they're even arguing to which L proceeded to reply to my previous comment about looking for money instead of getting married. She said it seemed that I had an inferiority complex to which R replied asking how. L proceed to say that it must have rubbed her the wrong way and the conversation ended there. I didn't want to say anything in the GC so I texted L privately asking her how my comment rubbed her the wrong way and how she felt. She is yet to reply to me and when she does I'll update you.

        "selftext": "Hello!  I (29, M) had an argument with my partner (29, M) over my decision to bail out of my partner's friend's wedding. Some background:I have a pretty bad social anxiety. I'm also not fully out of the closet and struggle with internalise homophobia (I'm not out to my family). I have not been fully comfortable with attending social events with my partner (weddings, parties etc.) as a couple because of my issues. I have made a few attempts but they did not go very well usually (I ended up feeling drained and stressed out). Recently we have been invited to my partner's friend's wedding (I don't know them well at all). He insisted it's important for him that I attend. I understood that and agreed. Recently, however a wedding of my cousin came up, which is actually on the same date as the other wedding. I am not that close to my cousin, but as everyone I am close with will be there, I think it's important for me to attend. Also, my parents made it clear that I should attend. I also live in a different country so I don't see them that often. I think that it is reasonable for me to attend the wedding of my cousin since it is my family instead of some other person's that I do not know well even though they're a friend of my partner. My parents of course do not know I have a partner, therefore I cannot say that I have that other wedding. My partner insisted that I lie to them and say that I am ill or already have a holiday booked, but I don't feel it's right (even though I needed to lie to them on some other occasions). To be honest, even if my parents knew about the situation, I still think it is reasonable for me to attend a wedding that is important for me and to spend some time with my family (and would actually be a bit weird the other way). Now, we had a big fight with my partner over this (the biggest so far). He is saying I broke a promise for an unspecified reason and that he does not want to attend the event on his own again. I however feel that because this is actually not because of my social anxiety or my internalised homophobia that I am not going with him, he is slightly overreacting. He says I do not care about his feelings, which is not true. I simply need to make a choice and this on its own is uncomfortable for me. AITA?",

I was talking to Abs and Beck, recently Beck and Hazel have been having drama over a boy (of course) and Hazel has been dragging it for months now, Beck and I were talking about how Hazel kept dragging it and about what Abs told us about what Hazel has said about Beck. Now it wasn't good stuff, Hazel was saying Beck was a bad person and that she was a slut.  Beck and I decided to make a group chat with Abs to all talk about it and Beck decided to confront Hazel, Hazel claimed she knew nothing about it even though both me and Abs have heard her say it. After that was over me and Abs agreed to texted Hazel and say we didn't want to be friends her anymore. Since Hazel was the type of person to talk crap about people Abs and I assumed there was stuff about us too. We both texted Hazel and explained. My reasoning was that Hazel kept dragging us into unnecessary drama and that I was worried she was talking crap about us, there was also the fact that Hazel was extremely open about her sexual life with her boyfriend (keep in mind we are ALL minors). She got upset claiming she has never talked shit, then heres were Tanny comes in.  Hazel brings Tanny into the conversation and Tanny starts arguing saying that Hazel never talked shit and that we had no proof of any of our claims, even though Hazel is extremely public about her gossip and personal life. Tanny then started posting about us publicly. Not only that but she then started sending Beck threats to hurt her. Me being tired of the harassment, I decided to just block them. Now that I think about it, I don't really feel bad at all. But theres still the fact it sort of seems that it was me who escalated the situation because it was my idea in the first place to message Hazel and tell her I didn't want to be friends.  I personally think my reasoning was valid because no child should be having sex nor causing unnecessary fights and drama over small things, but I want to know if this makes me the bad guy in this situation. I knew she was struggling with mental health, I knew she had trouble with her parents, and I knew this would affect her, but I still did it. Am I the asshole for this situation escalating and affecting someone, or was I in the right to unfriend her? I'm most likely the asshole in this situation, but I just made this so me and my friends could turn it into one of those Minecraft AI YouTube shorts videos. Thanks for reading!",

I\u2019ve been peppered with questions trying to get me to open up and spill the tea. I\u2019m uncomfortable with the questions so I just said \u201cahh they\u2019re probably mad at me for something\u201d (wasn\u2019t true) The person I said this too ran to my friend and told them. I was called out by my friend and told to not make any comments about them, that they\u2019re dealing with a lot and don\u2019t need this. Now I\u2019m the a-hole but just wanted to protect them",

        "selftext": "I (26 F) was cast in a paid fandub production back in the fall of 2019. However the project hasn't gone anywhere; there are only three people in the Discord server including myself and I've kept asking for updates every so often for the past five years, but I almost never get an answer. I'm tired of constantly being left in the dark. I've had a bad streak with voice acting projects; the ones I'm cast in almost never go through and the only reason one has gone through is that someone picked it up as co-director after the original one hadn't responded for months. But back to the paid one; this is my only paid role I've been cast in so far. And it just hasn't gone anywhere and I feel like I'm SO close to crashing out on someone. I want so badly to go off on them, but I'm worried about how this could impact me for future directors. I figured that I should get some input before making a decision, and so I wanna know; WIBTA if I did?",
